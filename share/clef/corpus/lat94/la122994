SCREEN STYLE / FASHION: OLD LOOK, NEW REALITY THE MOVIE: "LITTLE WOMEN" 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Setup: Louisa May Alcott's 1868 classic about the four chin-up March 
sisters, including aspiring writer Jo (Winona Ryder), and their proud, 
modern-thinking mother, Marmee (Susan Sarandon). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Colleen Atwood, whose credits include "Wyatt Earp," 
"Philadelphia," "Ed Wood," "Edward Scissorhands," "Silence of the Lambs" and 
"Married to the Mob." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I approached this from a mutual decision (with director Gillian 
Armstrong) to be more realistic than the two earlier versions of the movie, 
which were much more Hollywood," Atwood says of the 1933 interpretation 
starring Katharine Hepburn and the 1949 rendition with June Allyson and 
Elizabeth Taylor. Of the latter, she adds, "It was a real '40s palette -- a 
world of pastels. Their hair was definitely '40s, and they wore serious 
makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Shabby but not chic. Drab dresses in either rough wools or summer 
cottons, often with visible repairs. In many cases, including the white cotton 
nightgowns, the patches and darning came about honestly. But even the new 
dresses were subjected to mending. "We made little holes that we mended in some 
things, like a glove or a collar, and then repaired them," Atwood explains. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: The paintings and drawings of Winslow Homer and James McNeill 
Whistler -- "the really American artists," Atwood says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Antique clothing came from dealers around the country, including the 
Helen Larson Collection in Whittier. Crochet and knit gloves, vests and shawls 
and Marmee's snood were hand-made in New York. "Antique gloves, even when I 
found them, were way too small. . . . People were small then." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good Hair Day: All those center-parted manes are so lovely that it's hard to 
believe they're wigs. Except for Trini Alvarado (Meg) and Kirsten Dunst (young 
Amy), the female stars sported utterly convincing long-haired wigs made by 
Peter Owen ("Dangerous Liaisons," "Philadelphia" and "Wolf"). Employing 
strictly human hair, Owen says, he banned modern hairdressing techniques, such 
as using rollers and back-combing, "which can give the game away." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: Getting in costume meant about a half-hour with a dresser. Layers 
included true-to-the-period corset, camisole, bloomers, silk or cotton 
stockings, hoop and/or petticoats. Tiny little buttons up the back replaced 
zippers. "Everyone wanted to wait to the last minute to dress because the 
corsets were so uncomfortable," Atwood recalls. BETTY GOODWIN

SCREEN STYLE / FASHION: READY TO SCARE; THE MOVIE: "READY TO WEAR 
(PRET-A-PORTER)."

<P>
 The Setup: Some two dozen movie stars play fashion groupies, editors, 
parasites and French fashion designers, appearing alongside the real McCoys in 
a fashion farce that takes place during the twice-annual Paris collections. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Paris-based Catherine Leterrier, whose credits include 
about 100 French films (directed by Claude Lelouch, Alain Resnais and others), 
plus "Gorillas in the Mist" and "Meeting Venus." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Interwoven scenes of actual runway shows shot this spring in Paris 
and highly primped actors -- save for fashion reporter Anne Eisenhower (Julia 
Roberts), who spends the entire film in sweats and a hotel bathrobe until her 
brown Richard Tyler suit arrives from home. Plus don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-it 
cameos by fashion stars Jean-Paul Gaultier, Christian Lacroix, Issey Miyake, 
Sonia Rykiel and Gianfranco Ferre. But don't expect to ogle at Paris' biggest 
deities, Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld: They're nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Misses: The cinema ve rite pret-a-porter collections of Gaultier, Lacroix, 
Miyake, Rykiel, Vivienne Westwood (standing in for Richard Grant's Cort Romney 
line), Xuly Bet (Forest Whitaker's Cy Bianco takes the movie bow), and even 
Christian Dior come off as a big disappointing joke. (The clothes are actually 
available in shops now, should anyone be so inspired.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One comes away with the sense that this is territory better left to store 
buyers and fashion editors to sort out and analyze for future trends, because 
no one else could possibly take it all seriously. These decadent, extremely 
avant-garde designs give "hanger appeal" a new meaning. As Leterrier puts it: 
"Pure fashion is for magazines and runways." Also, a long-running bit with 
Texas boot maker Clint Lammeraux (Lyle Lovett) pairing his wares with the 
conservative collection of Nino Cerruti (er, the conservative collection of 
Anouk Aimee's Simone Lo) falls as flat as a pair of Chanel ballet slippers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hits: The troika of statement-making magazine editors -- Sissy Wanamaker 
(Sally Kellerman) representing America in Calvin Klein separates, Nina Scant 
(Tracey Ullman) in a Paul Smith redingote and over-the-top Philip Treacy top 
hat, and all-in-black Regina Krumm (Linda Hunt) in the very strict Japanese 
designer look: thick tights and flats. All three carry different versions of 
the fashion designers' handbag du jour -- by Prada. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You Should Know: The dazzling Isabella de la Fontaine (Sophia Loren), wife of 
head of the fashion commission, quite literally dresses from another era. Her 
curvy Christian Dior dresses -- both decollete and prim, full-skirted and 
straight -- were remade from archival 1950s patterns; her huge, platter hats 
are newly made from 1960s and '70s Jean Barthet designs; pumps by Roger Vivier 
are from the same era. Loren, it happened, is a longtime Dior customer and her 
fitting body is still on hand there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monsieur Claude at Dior who cut the suits said she has not changed. She does 
40 minutes of gym every morning, eats pasta every day and has not changed one 
centimeter," Leterrier reports. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "It's wild. It's not fake at all, all the clothes are the real things. 
We wanted it to be very, very realistic. Nothing was made for the runways for 
the production. Everybody was terribly eccentric and different. The only thing 
common to all our designers is that Miyake and Gaultier were both showing lit 
candles on the models' heads," Leterrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: TV reporter Kitty Potter (Kim Basinger) personifies the fashion 
journalist who changes clothes to flatter the designer whose collection she is 
attending. In short order, she switches from Claude Montana to Miyake to 
Gaultier to Lacroix to Dior. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bonus: Most of the actors (except those wearing Chanel) were able to take home 
their wardrobes. "Bob Altman gave it to them, including Sophia," Leterrier 
said. BETTY GOODWIN

THE STRAIGHT FACTS ON MASTURBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with great interest Dennis Romero's article, "It's Not a Taboo Topic in 
Some Schools" (Dec. 18).  
</P>
<P>
 I must applaud Cathy Golliher's efforts in ensuring her students are aware 
that masturbation is not hazardous to your health nor sinful. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach is one that can lead to abstention from sex for young people. In 
my 25 years of teaching middle-school adolescents, I have always tried to be as 
open as possible when any question is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 I do, however, disagree that the topic should stay "away from the personal 
level."  
</P>
<P>
 Adolescents operate only on the personal level. There is no way to have a 
truly frank discussion about masturbation without getting personal. Teens 
listen to and participate in sexual discussions but still leave with the big 
question: Is it OK for me?  
</P>

<P>
 May I offer a reason not to masturbate in response to Robin Abcarian's column 
("It's Not What Was Said, But How," Dec. 18). 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently 40% of men and 60% of women elect not to masturbate. Many are no 
doubt sexually fulfilled with partners, but I know many sexually inactive men 
and women find self-manipulation an unsatisfying, secondary experience and so 
choose, certainly with difficulty, to refrain.

SELF-ESTEEM MEANS CHILD HAS SURVIVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing in response to Kristina Sauerwein's article in today's paper, 
"The Spoils of Self-Esteem" (Dec. 14). 
</P>
<P>
 To equate "self-esteem" with "self-centeredness" is to miss the point.People 
who have a deep sense of self-worth are able to appreciate the points of view 
of others, to have compassion and to function as caring members of societies. 
</P>
<P>
 What was left out of the article is that raising a child with a high sense of 
self-esteem requires that the child experience adversity. 
</P>
<P>
 He or she must experience disappointment, must experience real consequences to 
actions, in a community or family that will support the child through these 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 It is when a child experiences adversity and survives, that she digs deeply 
into herself: "I did it. I am strong."

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; A VIVID, HONEST PORTRAIT OF HOMELESSNESS AND 
FRIENDSHIP; NATALIE ON THE STREET BY ANN NIETZKE , CALYX BOOKS, $24.95, CLOTH; 
$14.95, PAPER, 168 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLARA STURAK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On page 14 of "Natalie on the Street," Ann Nietzke writes: "Many women, 
especially unmarried women, have at least considered the fact that we live only 
a step or two or three away from the streets ourselves and that in America the 
older we get the more precarious our positions become." 
</P>
<P>
 This unfortunate truth is the leaping off point for an unusual story of two 
women and the friendship they build. Nietzke is one of those women. The other 
is Natalie, a homeless schizophrenic who takes up "residency" on Nietzke's 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Natalie on the Street," written as a journal, follows Ann and Natalie's 
relationship over a six-week period. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Ann's eyes, we watch as Natalie contends with the elements, nasty 
neighbors and her own unseen enemies, all the while hanging on to her precious 
piles of bulging plastic bags.  
</P>
<P>
 We see Ann's efforts to find a suitable place for Natalie, who is too sick to 
go to a shelter, too stubborn to be placed in a board and care facility. During 
the course of this thoughtful narrative, we learn just how hard it is to be 
without a home and how hard it is to find a way to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann (as Nietzke calls herself in the book) works part-time in a shelter for 
mentally ill homeless folks, so she knows what to expect when she approaches 
Natalie. But Ann is not ready for what happens when she asks Natalie for a cup, 
so that she can bring some coffee out to her: 
</P>
<P>
 "Natalie began reaching for various plastic bags and rustling through their 
contents with some thoroughness. To me they all appeared the same, most filled 
with more plastic or with paper plates and trash and wads of paper, others 
stuffed with ratty looking bits of cloth. Eventually she pulled out a 16-ounce 
(plastic foam) cup from Winchell's Donuts, reasonably clean with the lid still 
attached. She started to hand it to me, then jerked it back and removed the lid 
to peer inside. 'Well,' she said, holding it out for me to look. 'That's what 
came out of me.' Inside were two long, dark, solid, well-formed turds. 'I hate 
to have to show that to you, honey,' she whispered solemnly. 'But there it is.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the book revolves around the basics of human life with which Natalie 
(and Ann) must contend -- from the delicate exchange of plastic bags of food 
for plastic bags of waste, to moments where Ann pleads with Natalie to eat or 
drink more, only to realize that Natalie does not eat or drink as much as she 
may want to because she must inevitably get rid of it somewhere. How do you "go 
to the bathroom" when you have no bathroom to go to? 
</P>
<P>
 Ann, partially because she thinks she may be just "one paycheck away," and 
partially because she is alone herself -- in the process of recovering from a 
broken heart -- continues to make small contacts with Natalie. Slowly, they 
build a very limited trust. Ann never pretends that this process is easier than 
it is. Natalie is very ill; she rants at passersby and raves into the middle 
distance. Sometimes when Ann approaches, she smiles with recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, she is in a world of her own, filled with disturbing and violent 
visions, cruel inner voices. (Most of this material is too graphic to be 
printed here.) By simply recording Natalie's delusions, the author paints a 
relentlessly honest portrait of what it is to be homeless and mentally ill -- 
not only without the comforts of home, but unable to escape the unending 
nightmare that plays in your head. 
</P>
<P>
 By choosing to write "Natalie on the Street" as a nonfiction piece, Nietzke 
allows the reader no excuses -- we can't rationalize away Natalie's suffering 
as just a "touching story." But the choice also limits Nietzke's options; she 
is stuck with the truth, and in this case the truth is not always as 
enlightening as a good fiction account may have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Natalie's illness means that she does not -- cannot -- progress in ways that 
we want and even expect her to. She does not gradually become "cured." We will 
never know where her violently graphic ravings come from, what horrible thing 
(if it was any one thing) made her snap. Although this is the stark truth about 
Natalie, it makes her a problematic subject. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even more of a dilemma for the author is that in writing about herself, she 
must be an imperfect mirror. Nietzke never seems to decide if she is a 
character in this story, or just the keeper of facts. The few glimpses we do 
get of Ann's feelings are some of the nicest moments in the narrative: 
</P>
<P>
 " 'I've already washed my hair this morning, honey,' Natalie lies to Ann. 
'Everything but combed my hair. Your hair sure looks pretty.' She does a kind 
of double take then, leans on her elbow and brings her face right up to mine as 
I squat beside her. 'You just look beautiful,' she says, so sincerely I realize 
I've been feeling ugly for weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through "Natalie on the Street," Nietzke quotes Joan Didion's "On 
Morality": "Whether or not a corpse is torn apart by coyotes may seem only a 
sentimental consideration, but of course it is more: one of the promises we 
make to another is that we will try to retrieve our casualties, try not to 
abandon our dead to the coyotes. If we have been taught to keep our promises -- 
if in the simplest terms, our upbringing is good enough -- we stay with the 
body, or have bad dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Natalie is homeless. Natalie is mentally ill. Natalie is dirty and smelly; 
living in and around her own waste. Natalie rants and raves, screams at and 
berates Ann. Natalie is someone most people would simply pass on the street, 
averting their eyes as they went by. 
</P>
<P>
 But, like Ann, we can't turn away. We must see Natalie for who she is, know 
that we cannot change or fix her, but still choose to keep our promises, 
whether it be by saying a friendly hello, offering to help, or writing a book 
like "Natalie on the Street."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; NOT-SO-QUIET STORM BLASTS INTO TOWN; ANITA BAKER'S 
HIGH-DECIBEL SHOW PUSHES ASIDE SUBTLETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe Anita Baker is tired of being known as the queen of that stylish but 
sedate "quiet storm" radio format. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe she spent too much time watching MTV during her four-year break from 
concerts and became enthralled with the thunderous sonic assault of Metallica. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe someone just forgot to turn down the volume Tuesday at the Universal 
Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker is one of the most acclaimed figures in contemporary pop, a seven-time 
Grammy winner whose vocals generally reflect the taste and restraint that is 
often missing from the music of such young vocal overkillers as Whitney 
Houston, Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened in the opening show of Baker's much-anticipated, four-night 
Amphitheatre engagement? 
</P>
<P>
 Baker and crew gave the star-studded audience -- including Natalie Cole and 
Magic Johnson -- a show so excruciatingly loud that it neutralized almost all 
the subtlety and character that gives her music such individuality and heart. 
</P>
<P>
 If you weren't familiar with the songs, you would've had trouble making out 
more than a few words, not to mention the intended emotion. You couldn't tell 
whether Baker was singing a sad song or a happy one. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of high-decibel blast isn't unusual at rock concerts, where the acts 
and audiences are willing to sacrifice nuances for intensity and aggression. 
Let's face it -- you don't have to hear every word of a Nine Inch Nails show to 
know that Trent Reznor is one angry guy. 
</P>
<P>
 But phrasing is at the heart of Baker's artistry, which combines elements of 
pop, jazz, R&B and gospel in a graceful package. The idea on stage should be to 
showcase that phrasing, not obliterate it. Baker wasn't drowned out just by the 
seven-piece band, but also often by the three backup singers. This is the 
background punctuation you employ when you are trying to cover up vocal 
weaknesses, not celebrate strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 You could sense what was missing in the few times that things were toned down 
-- notably a strikingly sensual version of Rodgers & Hart's "My Funny 
Valentine," with George Duke sitting in on piano for the number. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker's failure to establish that intimacy more often, on material old and 
new, was all the more disappointing because she has evolved into such a winning 
performer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all her acclaim, Baker exhibited no trace of an aloof diva as she came 
on stage to a standing ovation, following a brief opening routine by comedian 
Terry Hodges. She has a quick, disarming smile and enjoys interacting with the 
crowd, whether stepping down front to shake hands or throwing in quick asides 
at the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 As she sang, Baker, wearing a black mini-dress, moved her entire body on 
upbeat songs so constantly -- swinging her arms above her head and executing 
quick dance steps -- that it appeared she was using her time on stage for some 
aerobic workouts.  
</P>
<P>
 Most engaging of all was when she let her hair down with salutes to two 
surprising vocal influences. Rather than Aretha Franklin or Sarah Vaughan, the 
influences cited most often by critics over the years, Baker donned the 
appropriate wigs and served up snippets of fireball Tina Turner's "Proud Mary" 
and the youthful Diana Ross' "Stop! In the Name of Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, however, on this night "quiet storm" gave way to a thunderbolt, and it 
wasn't pretty. At least Baker and crew have two more chances at the 
Amphitheatre to get it right. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anita Baker plays Friday at 8:15 p.m. and Saturday at 10 p.m. at the 
Universal Amphitheatre, 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City. Friday sold 
out, Saturday $55-$100. (818) 980-9421.

JOSHUA FACES HIS JAZZ JERICHO; REVIEW: SAXMAN REDMAN'S VACILLATING PERFORMANCE 
POINTS UP THE CONFLICTING DEMANDS OF ART AND COMMERCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I'm sorry we're beginning so late," said an apologetic Joshua Redman at 
Catalina Bar & Grill Tuesday night. "I'm from New York, so I'm usually on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I just dropped my tenor saxophone from this high," he said, holding his 
hand over his head, "and I'm afraid it's really, uh, messed up. So, here goes. 
Wish me luck." 
</P>
<P>
 If his horn was indeed messed up, the mechanical problems were nowhere evident 
in Redman's playing. This appearance, his third in the Southland this year, 
simply reinforced the widespread belief that he is one of the most important 
young lions of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 More significant, however, was his worry over punctuality -- his show started 
a half-hour late -- and his preparedness, which reflected a concern for 
audience reaction that reached, sometimes too deeply, into his music as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Redman, 25, is a bright and thoughtful artist (he is a graduate of Harvard), 
intimately in touch with, and attentive to, his role in the historical flow of 
jazz. He's powerfully influenced by Sonny Rollins, equally aware of John 
Coltrane, and blends patterns and tones from both into his own musical vista. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is also a performer of the '90s, subject to the rigorous pressures of 
the commercial musical world. A sold-out room and an enthusiastic audience of 
the sort that greeted him Tuesday, with a waiting line for the second show, 
place a special demand upon an artist, and Redman is far too astute to be 
unaware of the presence of that demand. 
</P>
<P>
 And his playing, superb though it was at times, revealed the contradictions 
that can be generated by the jazzman's eternal need to deal with the 
inconsistencies between the requisites of art and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 In a program devoted largely to works from his current album, Redman seemed to 
vacillate, often uncomfortably so, from remarkably intense improvisational 
explorations to more superficial efforts to arouse the excitement of his 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was good, he was brilliant. In originals such as "Rejoice" and, 
especially, the ballad "Sweet Sorrow," Redman was astonishingly articulate, 
unleashing dazzling torrents of notes that, for all their multiplicity, emerged 
with the precision and logic of a Mozart melody. His occasional cadenzas were 
virtuosic tours de force, roving all over the horn, popping out high harmonics, 
instantly countering with bottoming honks. 
</P>
<P>
 Redman's more calculated efforts were considerably less musically effective. 
Almost every improvisation, for example, was captured, in at least one spot, by 
a sequence of rising, repetitious phrases that climaxed in crowd-pleasing high 
notes. At one point, he even tried a circular breathing phrase not unlike that 
used by players as diverse as Harry Carney and Kenny G. These are, of course, 
typical tenor saxophone dramatics, tracing back as far as Flip Phillips, 
Charlie Ventura and the Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts of the '40s. Yet, for 
all their effectiveness, they do not represent an approach that feels 
appropriate -- especially not when done with such frequency -- for a major 
talent actively in the process of discovering his own voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating the art/commerce conflict in his music, Redman does not 
seem to be challenging himself with sufficiently exacting material. Still a 
budding composer, he does some interesting things: "Sweet Sorrow" juxtaposed an 
atmospheric, film noir melody against a Satie-like piano accompaniment. More 
often, his pieces -- captivated at the moment by too powerful a fascination 
with soul jazz inflections -- provided few unusual harmonic triggers for 
extended improvisation. And he's too good not to be stretching his envelope a 
bit more. 
</P>
<P>
 Redman was accompanied by his regular group: the amazing Christian McBride on 
bass, Brad Mehldau on piano and Brian Blade on drums. Mehldau and Blade offered 
sturdy if not always notably unique support. 
</P>
<P>
 But McBride is one of the finds of the '90s. Curiously, he played only a few 
solos in Redman's opening set. When he did, McBride's magisterial presence 
dominated the room in a way that underscored his identity as a franchise player 
who will have growing impact upon jazz well beyond the remainder of the decade.

 U.S. Premiere Scheduled: Shekhar Kapur's controversial film "Bandit Queen," 
based on the life of notorious Indian outlaw Phoolan Devi, is scheduled to have 
its U.S. premiere Jan. 14 as part of the Sixth Annual Palm Springs 
International Film Festival. Last week a New Delhi judge banned the movie's 
screening in India, after Devi sued producers saying they had not let her see 
the film, which she believes is inaccurate. Although the New Delhi judge 
reportedly told producers not to show the film in India or abroad, distributors 
Film Four London maintain that they have the rights to show the film, and 
barring any further court action, plan to go ahead with the U.S. premiere. The 
film made waves when it was shown at the Cannes Film Festival. TELEVISION

 More Congressional Coverage?: C-SPAN's campaign for increased coverage of 
Congress got a boost Tuesday as incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) threw his support behind several of the cable channel's proposals. In 
a letter to C-SPAN chief Brian Lamb, Dole promised to "do what I can to 
increase public access to Congress" and said he supports opening to television 
cameras "all public meetings of Senate-House conference committees" as well as 
the majority leader's so-called "dugout" briefings for reporters. Since 
allowing coverage of the conference committees would require a concurrent 
resolution passed by both houses, Dole said he will consult with incoming House 
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and others about initiating such a resolution. 
Dole also said he would work to form a bipartisan Senate group to examine the 
feasibility and cost effectiveness of expanded coverage. Last month, Lamb wrote 
the leadership of the new GOP majorities in the House and Senate proposing a 
liberalization of rules governing the public affairs network's access to daily 
events in both houses.

CLUB REVIEW; AT MICELI'S IN HOLLYWOOD, A REFRESHING LACK OF ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When venturing into one of Hollywood's "in" clubs for the first time, the 
seasoned Southlander knows to expect less-than-gracious treatment. While a sea 
of well-groomed bodies pushes past you in a cramped entryway, you feel adrift 
in a foreign land -- the only patron who doesn't know the secret 
handshake.After an hour or so, the maitre d' offers a little table by the 
kitchen, with no waiters for miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this is why discovering Miceli's is cause to celebrate. The first time 
you enter the venerable supper club, the staff treats you like a million bucks. 
The philosophy is born out of the venue's humble beginnings: Miceli's was the 
first pizzeria in Hollywood to display its pie-makers in the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 45 years later, Miceli's offers one of Hollywood's most delightful 
nights out. Not only is it reportedly Hollywood's oldest still-in-the-family 
restaurant -- original owners Carmen and Sylvia Miceli (71 and 64, 
respectively) are aided by their three sons and a bevy of brothers -- but the 
staff is also composed of bartenders, waiters and hosts who can carry a tray as 
well as a tune. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-level establishment features live music nightly, highlighted by a 
team that serves up heapings of Sinatra and Puccini along with Miceli's pasta. 
Sunday evenings, jazz trumpeter Bill Berry's quartet, featuring vocalist Jay 
Salerno, makes the decades melt away. All this without a cover charge, drink 
minimum or humiliation.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; PUBLIC ENEMY: ENERGETIC, BUT THRILL IS GONE

 Public Enemy titled its latest album "Muse Sick N Hour Mess Age," and the New 
York rap group's two-hour performance before an adoring audience at the House 
of Blues on Tuesday revealed the muse is indeed sick, the message a mess. 
Rappers Chuck D. and Flavor Flav and deejay Terminator X still had the energy 
that once made them the most compelling force in hard-core rap, but the thrill 
of their music is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 As if still trying to prove the critics wrong -- "Muse Sick" was widely panned 
-- Public Enemy performed a set weighted by the new material, opting for a 
quick medley of some of their best songs. The result was a cacophony of 
mediocrity, as one song blurred into the next. The highlight was "Fight the 
Power," one of the greatest songs of the last decade, because it still has the 
lyrical and aural urgency that was the group's trademark. Unfortunately, it 
came midway through the performance, leaving the rest of the evening bogged in 
contradictions and muddy speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 The star of the night was rapper-singer-guitarist Wyclef, the frontman of the 
second-billed Fugees. Backed by a drummer, a bassist and a deejay, Wyclef led 
the audience on a hip-hop pageant play, offering a brief history of pop music 
as he and his co-rappers paid tribute to the likes of Bob Marley, Lou Reed and 
Suzanne Vega, while reinterpreting and updating the lyrics to suit the times. 
Their performance was as fresh as Public Enemy's was spent. HEIDI SIEGMUND

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ALLMAN'S TOO LAID-BACK AT COACH HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-one years ago, Gregg Allman recorded a hit album called "Laid Back." 
Laid-back he remains -- to a fault. On Tuesday at the Coach House here, he and 
his eight-piece band put on a show that wasn't just uninspired -- it was 
practically lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Allman, 47, played such crowd favorites as "I'm No Angel," "Slip Away" and 
"Melissa," but tempos dragged, prosaic solos went nowhere and songs meandered 
ad infinitum .  
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Allman seemed bored, even zombie-like as he fussed around at a 
snail's pace and mumbled unintelligibly between songs. While his husky, 
mournful vocals still are instantly recognizable, there simply was no spark nor 
passion to his music or his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening was marred further by the sound mix: Allman's vocals were all but 
inaudible during the first few songs, and throughout the show his acoustic 
guitar sounded like someone dragging a 2-by-4 over piano wires. 
</P>
<P>
 The Allman Brothers Band (recently elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) 
seems to be enjoying a creative second wind in the last few years, but it is 
apparent that Gregg needs his bandmates' energy and spirit of musical adventure 
to carry off a show of his own. His rueful efforts Tuesday warranted nothing 
short of the whipping post. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gregg Allman plays tonight at the Palace, 1735 N. Vine St., 8:30. $24.50. 
(213) 462-3000. Also Saturday at the Ventura Theatre, 26 S. Chestnut Ave.,

ART REVIEWS; 'FACTS AND FIGURES': WHEN METAPHORS REPLACE OBJECTIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Facts and Figures: Selections From the Lannan Foundation Collection" is a 
rich, stimulating exhibition in which numbers don't add up and facts never 
speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiring profound doubt, this 14-artist show also invites poetic license. As 
viewers are called upon to interpret its 45 representational images, subjective 
impulses intermingle with mute objectivity, charging the installation with 
psychological complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Shaw's small, flat-footed pencil drawings of newspaper pictures, Vija 
Celmins' meditative painting of the night sky and Thomas Ruff's gigantic, 
passport-style photos of expressionless German youths treat their subjects 
neutrally. Simultaneously, these works declare that facts are not neutral 
entities that can be precisely calculated, but loaded occurrences whose 
significance depends upon one's perspective, desires and beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Hill's two mesmerizing video installations amplify the ambiguity at the 
root of human experience. In "Tall Ships," viewers enter a long, dark corridor 
on the walls of which are projected 12 separate images of ordinary people 
standing or sitting in the distance. As you pass each one, it appears to come 
forth from the void, as if to greet you. These ghostly figures walk back into 
the shadows only after you turn away, creating an unsettling, 
mirror-relationship between their spectral intangibility and your fleshy 
mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's "Inasmuch as It Is Always Already Taking Place" internalizes the sense 
of dislocation and missed communication central to "Tall Ships." Consisting of 
16 disemboweled monitors and a tangle of cables set in a deep niche in the 
wall, this quasi-anonymous piece of self-portraiture intimates that human 
bodies are mysterious landscapes, to which their inhabitants pay too little 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Chuck Close's gridded, part-by-part portrait of painter Alex Katz 
painstakingly measures the distance between a person and his physical 
appearance. "American Costume," David Hammons' monoprint of his face surrounded 
by his fingerprints in the shape of an Afro, poignantly marks the territory 
where self-determination collides with social prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Sherman's five black-and-white photographs of her face, made up to look 
like five different people, humorously records how individual identity forms at 
the points where stereotypes break down. Putting a hilarious spin on the idea 
that commonly accepted facts were once outlandish fictions, Jeffrey Vallance's 
"Relics From Two Vatican Performances" locates myth-making power in the hands 
of creative observers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerhard Richter's paintings of sexy women and of a heavily lipsticked mouth 
that looks more animal than human link the exhibition to Andy Warhol's art, 
where the embrace of superficiality was loaded with deep ambivalence. Always 
ambiguous, even when they seem to be most straightforward, the pictures in 
"Facts and Figures" begin where objectivity falls short and metaphors take 
over. 
</P>

 Overworked and Unfinished: James Trivers is an eccentric, L.A.-based wit whose 
books, paintings and prints have, in the past, been wickedly funny, even 
outrageously original. But his seven muddled pictures at Newspace look 
overworked and unfinished, with or without the cheap, 3-D glasses you're 
supposed to wear when viewing them. 
</P>
<P>
 To the naked eye, Trivers' diamond-shaped paintings resemble plaid fabrics 
whose stripes are not properly aligned and whose colors are smeared and 
smudged, as if they've been dyed too many times or accidentally printed on both 
sides before having dried. Ballerinas, marines, flying ducks, domestic scenes, 
a smiley face and horses engaged in human foreplay are only some of the 
characters in the artist's loose compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 Donning the glasses clears up some of the muddiness but causes other problems. 
Trivers' paintings, seen through blue and red lenses, sometimes exaggerate the 
effects of collage, appearing to be superimposed images that hover on the same 
plane. For the most part, however, the 3-D glasses don't significantly alter 
the works. The main difference is that wearing them gives you a headache. 
</P>
<P>
 At his best, Trivers delivers off-base, on-target attacks on conventional 
wisdom. Though his art often makes scathing sense by reveling in absurdity, 
this time around it has the presence of a cliche. These paintings fail to 
generate sufficient energy to get past the clever, tongue-in-cheek humor with 
which they begin.

 One-Work Show: Frighteningly few contemporary artists make work so compelling 
that a single painting, slightly larger than easel-scale, is captivating, 
powerful or noteworthy enough to be an exhibition unto itself. For Llyn 
Foulkes, who hasn't had a solo show here since 1983, even to think of mounting 
a one-work exhibition is so ridiculous that actually doing so just might make 
some kind of perverse sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Foulkes' solitary self-portrait at Patricia Faure Gallery 
cannot carry a show. In fact, the veteran L.A.-based painter's new piece does 
not even rank among his strongest images: If placed next to paintings included 
in recent group shows, "The Unfinished Picture" would be the weak link. 
</P>
<P>
 As if Foulkes (or his dealer) were aware of the folly of showing only one 
work, a 45-minute video plays in a back gallery. In it, the artist carries on a 
frenetic, expressive and occasionally crazed monologue about the development of 
his work and the difficulties of being an artist in today's treacherous world. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by bitterness and paranoia, the tape steals the show. It's more 
gripping than the painting because it conveys the lunatic energy that animates 
Foulkes, shedding insights into his character that don't come through in the 
painted portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 The video also shows some earlier versions of "The Unfinished Picture," before 
Foulkes cut it down to its present size, eliminated a figure and simplified the 
composition. If this work is truly unfinished, it might be more interesting in 
the future, when these elements (and some of the video's lively psychodrama) 
make their way back into the picture.

 Picture-Perfect: James Welling's black-and-white photographs at Regen Projects 
strive to generate neither excitement nor anger, passion nor disdain. Suffused 
with just a whiff of once-hip, now musty French theory, and studiously designed 
to possess only a bit of dumb, American good looks, the New York-based artist's 
blandly handsome pictures of people, landscapes and buildings are so 
presentable, appropriate and pleasant that you feel you've seen them before. 
</P>
<P>
 Shot in styles that recur in textbooks on the history of photography, 
Welling's images are printed with tried-and-true techniques. The subjects they 
depict are free of controversy. The genres they rehash are thoroughly 
conventional. These safe pictures could hardly be more middle-of-the-road. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as if the 43-year-old artist's goal is to dress up the present in the 
clothes of art history's official, institutional past. His photos act as if 
they want to erase the present by inserting it, as nothing more than a 
footnote, into a narrative that has already been written. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the experience of familiarity Welling's work seeks has been 
ballyhooed and packaged as an essential aspect of late-Postmodernism, this 
carefully fabricated sense of deja vu is actually part of an attempt, by 
wanna-be academics, to control uncertainty and to eliminate the untidiness of 
unexpected events -- such as original works of art.

 Domino's Pizza compiles amazing statistics about its pizza deliveries. The 
company reports that men wearing muscle shirts when answering the door order 
pepperoni three times more often than any other topping. People who have 
pierced noses, lips or eyebrows ask for a vegetarian topping 23% more often 
than a meat topping. Those who have wind chimes on the porch are four times 
more likely than the average to want olives on their pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 A recurring element in Domino's figures is the suspicious correlation between 
pizza-eating and TV-watching. Whatever day and time "Roseanne" airs is always 
the biggest half hour of the week for meat-topped pizza orders. The biggest 
hour for pizza delivery ever was O.J. Simpson's slow-mo freeway chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Since you asked, the number one pizza-ordering show (figured by comparing 
orders during its time slot with weeks when the show doesn't air) is "Melrose 
Place," which is also by far the leading show for vegetable-topped pizzas. And 
by the way, pizza orders in the "Melrose Place" time slot have gone up 14% 
since Heather Locklear joined the cast.  
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yeah: While "The Simpsons" is on the air, crank calls to Domino's go up 
16%. The Best Insect for the Job Is a Mammal 
</P>
<P>
 Ieie, the climbing pandanus of Hawaii, is pollinated not by insects but by 
rats, who get their fur and whiskers covered with pollen while eating the 
fleshy leaves at the base of the flowers. Some relatives of the ieie are 
pollinated by a kind of bat. Except in Anorexic Zebras 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so this probably won't come up much, but if you ever need to know whether 
somebody's serving you zebra meat, check out the fat. It's a deep chrome yellow 
color. The Burgermeister 
</P>
<P>
 Gadgets for making burger patties go back 50 years or more. The new wrinkle 
with the Tastee Rings Burger Press is its circular grooves, which squeeze air 
from the patty and close cracks in the meat as you press it. The resulting 
grooves in the surface of the patty (which needn't be meat, of course -- it'll 
work with any moldable food) also increase its heat-absorbing area. You're 
supposed to use it with plastic wrap, which makes it unnecessary to touch the 
food from mixing bowl to grill. In markets, or send $4.95 plus $2 shipping to

 A scientific paper entitled "Does Beano Prevent Gas? A Double-Blind Crossover 
Study of Oral Alpha-Galactosidase to Treat Dietary Oligosaccharide Intolerance" 
points out the market for gas-preventing pills and drops such as Beano is not 
unlimited. For some people, "the production of high volumes of resonant, 
pungent intestinal gas is a source of personal pride and fulfillment and can be 
used as a greeting or other form of communication." CHARLES PERRY

 The grossest inequity in the nondrinking world may be the lack of beautiful 
stemware. Why do drinkers get all the elegant crystal? If not alcohol, what can 
you sip from a martini glass, a brandy snifter, a Champagne flute? "I gave up 
drinking," says Helen K. "Why do I have to give up Waterford?" 
</P>
<P>
 Face it: The nondrinker's choices are rarely as creative, labor-intensive 
and/or eye-catching as cocktails. While the host shaves ice for margaritas this 
holiday, or stirs up a pitcher of Gibsons, non-imbibers are offered clumsy 
tumblers of mineral water, diet Coke, coffee. Even worse: a sticky punch made 
for the children. 
</P>

 "Zero Proof" by Pamela Stovall and Richard Lalich (St. Martin's Press: 1994; 
$10.95) is a handy bartender's guide with recipes for 200 nonalcoholic drinks 
gathered from restaurants across America, many of which fit quite nicely into 
those old Pilsner, martini or hurricane glasses. The vast majority of the 
drinks are fruit-based and sweet, from the un-fuzzy navel (orange and lemon 
juice, peach nectar, and grenadine) to frozen Oreo cookie (ice cream, Oreo 
cookies, Hershey's syrup), but there are also sections devoted to virgin Marys, 
nonalcoholic wine and nonalcoholic beers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary-infused lemonade from the Vidalia restaurant in Washington, not too 
sweet, has a good, piney-cold punch (like gin, only better). Plus, you get to 
muddle (that's bartender talk for "crush") sugar and use a martini shaker 
without having to designate a driver. The cinnamon twist from Kaspar's in 
Seattle tastes, not unpleasantly, like thinned and frappeed applesauce, but 
it's a welcome change from straight Martinelli's, and the daiquiri stem glass 
rimmed in raw sugar has its own satisfactions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a savory, rather than sweet drink, there's always the virgin Mary. There 
are probably as many variations on this drink as there are people who drink it. 
In The Times Test Kitchen, we tried seven different recipes from the book, then 
took elements that we liked best -- A-1 from one recipe, a base of Clamato and 
V8 from another, dill seeds from a third -- and concocted a rather busy virgin 
Mary but one praised by all our tasters for its big, interesting flavor and 
sneaky, compelling heat. VIDALIA'S ROSEMARY LEMONADE

NEW YEAR'S; SAVE THE CANAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES HALL, Hall is a recent graduate of the California Culinary Academy, 
and worked in The Times Test Kitchen as an intern. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever friends tell me they are going to throw a big cocktail party, I know 
exactly what they are imagining: nothing short of a Tott's Champagne commercial 
with martinis in place of the bubbly. Beautiful people dance across parquet 
floors under an intoxicating din of revelry and conversation. It's all so 
sophisticated.  
</P>
<P>
 I also know that the party will turn out more like a Bud Light commercial. 
Comfortable friends catch up on old times and kid each other over cold beer, 
cheap wine and lots of chips and salsa. Not bad. But certainly not 
sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I have to say that I love salsa. It's versatile, you can do a hundred 
variations of it, and it goes great with either fish, poultry or meat -- it's a 
healthy alternative to heavy sauces. But right now I'm blowing the whistle on 
salsa and chips as the main event at cocktail parties. And the same goes for 
all that guacamole folks keep pulling out of their kitchens by the vatful, 
screaming about how the recipe is a family secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hosts solve the problem of chip-and-dip mediocrity by serving nothing at 
all. I caution against this. No matter what the time of day or number of 
people, guests at a cocktail party expect food.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, eating food served buffet-style at a cocktail party is a 
juggling act worthy of the Cirque Du Soleil. It is asking too much of a guest 
to stand for hours contributing to conversation while holding a drink in one 
hand and a plate of food that requires utensils in the other. Serve buffet food 
when you have the space to create small eating areas, and when food, not 
cocktails, is the focus of your gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the solution? Very simply, it is the canape. Yes, the canape, that 
little hors d'oeuvre thing you see pictured on the Carr's wafer box. 
</P>
<P>
 People don't serve canapes anymore. In fact, the first and last time I saw one 
was at cooking school. But now is the time for a canape revival. Ignore the 
complicated look of these tidbits. The hardest part of making a canape is not 
burning the bread. 
</P>
<P>
 It may help to know that canape is French for "couch." This makes sense 
because a canape is simply a main ingredient, usually a protein of some sort, 
lying casually and elegantly on a base, or couch, of something crisp, and 
dressed up with a colorful garnish. 
</P>
<P>
 As with anything so French and so good, there are a couple of rules to keep in 
mind. The canape should be easily grasped and eaten in one or one-and-one-half 
bites. This is serious stuff because guests eating canapes need to simply pick 
them up and pop them in their mouths. Pop, chew, wipe, smile, drink. That's it! 
No plates. No utensils. 
</P>
<P>
 Eye appeal is as important as taste. Consider this when thinking about color 
or height. A pimiento or red pepper wedge can brighten, while a length of chive 
can bring height to the hors d'oeuvre. Canapes should be uncomplicated yet 
elegant. A good idea is to purchase a pastry bag with a variety of tips. Above 
all, be creative, use the included recipes for inspiration (or for your 
first-time canape party), then create your own canape creations. 
</P>
<P>
 When it is time to assemble your canapes, gather all of your ingredients 
together before you start. Prepare the canapes in an assembly-line format. For 
instance, cut out all of your bases from the bread and toast. Then smear the 
spread on your toasted bread bases. Next, top all of your spreads with the main 
ingredient. Finally, garnish all.  
</P>
<P>
 Before you know it you will have 50 canapes. One other thing, don't build your 
canapes too far in advance. Your base will get soggy after about three hours. 
You can do all the chopping and cooking long before the party, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Plan for two to three canapes per person if passed, four to five if served 
buffet style. Combined with a cheese tray, a vegetable platter and maybe a 
shrimp bowl, you'll have plenty of food to go around -- and just a bunch of 
napkins to throw away. If only martinis came in recyclable glasses. 
</P>

 The following recipes were developed in The Times Test Kitchen. For the lamb 
medallions, you may substitute pork tenderloin and a favorite chutney, pureed, 
for the base.  
</P>
<P>
 LAMB MEDALLIONS ON SOURDOUGH TOAST WITH MINT CREAM CHEESE AND CRANBERRY MINT 
LEAF GARNISH 
</P>
<P>
 1 (2 1/2-pound) lamb rib roast 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic, halved lengthwise 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 loaf sourdough bread, unsliced  
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup apple-mint jelly or mint jelly 
</P>
<P>
 4 ounces cream cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup Port wine 
</P>
<P>
 25 cranberry halves 
</P>
<P>
 25 small mint leaves 
</P>
<P>
 Have butcher remove tenderloin from rib roast. Keep bones for stock. Remove 
all fat and silverskin from tenderloin. 
</P>
<P>
 Rub roast with garlic, salt and pepper to taste. Roast in 350-degree oven 
until lamb reaches internal temperature of 140 degrees when tested with 
instant-read thermometer, about 40 minutes. Cool meat. Wrap tightly in plastic 
wrap. Refrigerate. May be done 1 day ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Slice sourdough bread lengthwise horizontally into 3/8-inch slices. Using 1 
1/2-inch to 2-inch star-shaped or round cookie cutter, cut out rounds from 
bread. Toast rounds just until golden brown. If rounds are made ahead, store 
them in airtight container. Do not refrigerate. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine apple-mint jelly and cream cheese in food processor or blender. If 
doing ahead, cover and refrigerate mint-cheese mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread mint-cheese mixture evenly onto toasted rounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Slice tenderloin into 1/4-inch-thick medallions and lay on top of mint-cheese 
mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour Port into saute pan, add cranberry halves and briefly poach until just 
tender. Place dab of mint-cheese mixture in center of lamb disck then top each 
with 1 mint leaf and 1 cranberry half. Makes 25 canapes.

PATE-A-CHOUX WITH PISTACHIO-AND-PIMIENTO PUREE AND GREEN GRAPE SPEAR 
</P>
<P>
 1 small bunch green grapes 
</P>
<P>
 Pate-a-Choux Rounds 
</P>
<P>
 Chicken Liver Mousse 
</P>
<P>
 Pistachio-and-Pimiento Puree 
</P>
<P>
 Slice grapes into lengthwise quarters to make spears, 1 quarter for each 
canape. Set aside. Grapes will discolor, if cut too far in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Slice baked Pate-a-Choux Rounds in half, making 1 top and 1 bottom for each. 
Using pastry bag with No. 3 star tip, pipe Chicken Liver Mousse onto bottom 
rounds. Cover each with top rounds. Using same tip on separate pastry bag, pipe 
small amount of Pistachio-and-Pimiento Puree to cover doughnut holes of each 
round. Place 1 grape spear vertically into puree on each round. Makes 25 
canapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Each canape contains: 
</P>
<P>
 140 calories; 112 mg sodium; 132 mg cholesterol; 10 grams fat; 7 grams

</P>
<P>
 Chicken Liver Mousse 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons shallots 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups chicken livers, chopped coarsely 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon thyme 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup brandy 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter in large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add shallots and saute 1 
minute. Adds chicken livers. Add thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Saute 3 to 4 minutes until livers are slightly springy yet still rosy on 
inside. Remove livers and set aside, leaving shallots in pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Raise heat to high and add brandy to saute pan. Ignite brandy and flambe 
shallots, tossing shallots by flipping pan by its handle. (This helps loosen 
brown bits left in pan from livers.) When flaming stops, brandy should be 
reduced to about 1 tablespoon. Scrape sides and bottom of pan with wooden 
spoon. Remove pan from heat and cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Place contents of saute pan in food processor along with reserved chicken 
livers. Begin processing while slowly adding whipping cream until mixture 
resembles thick mousse. (You may not need to use entire 1/2 cup of cream.) Cool 
in refrigerator. May be made 1 day in advance.  
</P>
<P>
 Pate-a-Choux 
</P>
<P>
 7 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/8 cups water 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup butter  
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt  
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups bread flour 
</P>
<P>
 Combine 1 egg and 1/8 cup (2 tablespoons) water in small bowl to make egg 
wash. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Boil remaining 1 cup water, butter and salt. Add bread flour, all at once, and 
stir until dough forms, pulling away from sides of pan. Place in mixing bowl 
with paddle attachment. On low speed, mix dough, adding remaining 6 eggs, 1 at 
time, until eggs are worked into dough. 
</P>
<P>
 Place dough in pastry bag with Number 4 or 5 round tip and pipe dough into 25 
(1-inch) doughnut shapes on greased baking sheet. Brush rounds with egg wash. 
Bake at 400 degrees until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool rounds and store 
in tightly covered container. Do not refrigerate. 
</P>
<P>
 Pistachio-and-Pimiento 
</P>
<P>
 Puree 
</P>
<P>
 2 ounces bottled pimientos 
</P>
<P>
 2 ounces pistachios 
</P>
<P>
 Drain pimientos and place in food processor. Begin processing and add 
pistachios until mixture achieves crunchy peanut butter consistency. SMOKED 
SALMON AND LEEK ROULADE WITH DILL CREAM CHEESE ON PUMPERNICKEL 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 leek, white part only, cut into long strips 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 4 pounds smoked salmon or gravlax, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 bunch dill 
</P>
<P>
 4 ounces cream cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
 Whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 1 loaf pumpernickel or black bread, unsliced 
</P>
<P>
 Place butter in saute pan over medium-high heat. Add leek strips and salt and 
pepper to taste. Saute until just tender. Cool to room temperature.  
</P>
<P>
 Lay 1 (16x12-inch) sheet of clear plastic wrap on clean smooth work surface. 
Lay 2 overlapping rows of salmon slices in large rectangle shape on plastic 
wrap, leaving 1 inch of wrap uncovered around edges. Scatter sauteed leek 
randomly on top of salmon.  
</P>
<P>
 Lift bottom side (closest to you) of plastic wrap and use as guide to roll 
salmon into log shape. Do not wrap plastic wrap inside log. Once log is made, 
move to bottom of plastic wrap. Wrap salmon log in plastic wrap, holding top 
side (farthest from you) of plastic wrap with 1 hand while covering and pulling 
log toward you with other hand. Tightly twist plastic wrap on 1 end of 
plastic-wrapped log and tie securely with twine. Twist plastic wrap on other 
end tightly and tie securely with kitchen twine. This makes salmon log as tight 
as possible. Place salmon log in freezer several hours to firm up. May be done 
several days in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve 25 small sprigs from dill bunch. Place remaining sprigs in food 
processor with cream cheese and mustard. Process until smooth, or place in 
mixing bowl and blend with hand mixer. If mixture is too thick, thin out with 
small bit of whipping cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove salmon roulade from freezer. Thaw several hours.  
</P>
<P>
 Slice pumpernickel loaf lengthwise horizontally. Cut 25 (1-inch) circles out 
of slices with cookie cutter, then toast. Cool. Spread dill cream cheese 
mixture on toast bases. Place remaining dill cream cheese in pastry bag fitted 
with Number 2 tip. Slice salmon roulade into 25 (1/4-inch-thick) round 
medallions. (If salmon is still bit frozen, don't worry. It is easier to slice 
in this state and will be completely thawed by serving time.) Place salmon 
medallions on dill-cream cheese coated bread rounds. Pipe dab of remaining dill 
cream cheese in center of salmon medallions and place 1 dill sprig on top of 
each. Makes 25 canapes.

ROUNDS WITH PLUM SAUCE AND PICKLED EGGPLANT GARNISH 
</P>
<P>
 8 won ton wrappers 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup plum sauce  
</P>
<P>
 2 ounces pea sprouts  
</P>
<P>
 7 ounces enoki mushrooms  
</P>
<P>
 24 slivers pickled red ginger  
</P>
<P>
 1 cup canola oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium-thin cucumber 
</P>
<P>
 24 slivers pickled purple eggplant  
</P>
<P>
 Place 8 won ton wrappers on level work surface, positioned so that corners of 
each won ton form diamond shape instead of square. Make sure wrappers aren't 
stuck together. 
</P>
<P>
 Dab corners of each won ton wrapper with little plum sauce. Place small amount 
of pea sprouts horizontally in center of each won ton wrap. Top sprouts with 
small amount of enoki mushrooms, making sure that mushroom caps appear on both 
sides. Top enoki with sprinkling of red ginger. Bring bottom corner of each won 
ton wrap to center, as if you were making envelopes, so that filling in each 
won ton is covered. Next, bring sides of won ton toward center, then roll wrap 
to top corner. Plum sauce should act like glue, holding won ton together. 
Packages will look more like egg rolls than won tons at this stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour 1/4-inch of oil in large saute pan and heat until very hot but not 
smoking (350 degrees). Place won tons in hot oil in 2 batches, turning quickly 
and watching very closely. When won tons are golden brown, remove to paper 
towels to drain, then cool. 
</P>
<P>
 With sharp knife, cut ends of each won ton at 45-degree angle and twice again 
at equal intervals in center to make 3 won tons from 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Using tip of vegetable peeler, make lines every 1/2 inch lengthwise along side 
of cucumber. Slice cucumber into 24 (1/4-inch) disks and place large dab of 
plum sauce in center of each. Lay won ton section sideways on top of each 
cucumber and stick 1 enoki mushroom in each end. Place small dab of plum sauce 
on top of each won ton to hold garnish. Garnish each with small sliver of 
pickled purple eggplant crossed with silver of red ginger. Makes 24 canapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Pickled red ginger, enoki mushrooms and pickled purple eggplant can be 
found at Japanese specialty food stores. MADEIRA-BLUE CHEESE-STUFFED DATES WITH 
PISTACHIO AND KIWI

 Pour Madeira into saute pan and reduce by half over medium-high heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Place blue cheese in food processor, begin processing and add reduced Madeira 
until mixture resembles thick mousse. 
</P>
<P>
 Slice ends off each date. Using small finger, push pit out of each date. Cut 
through center of each date at 45-degree angle. Place date halves upright on 
flat ends. Place blue cheese mixture in pastry bag fitted with No. 3 star tip 
and pipe into hollows of dates. Sprinkle chopped pistachios on top of blue 
cheese. Garnish each canape with 1 very small kiwi wedge. Makes 26 canapes.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: DUCK! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beijing duck may be the consensus greatest hit of Chinese cuisine; universally 
popular, easy to eat, fearsomely complicated to prepare. It is the most 
expensive dish on the average Chinese menu, and the only one that must usually 
be ordered a day in advance -- to a lot of people the definition of a really 
swank Chinese restaurant includes the ability to eat Beijing duck on demand. 
When travelers visit China itself, the reservation they beg from their hotel 
concierges is for Quanjude, the four-story restaurant off Tian An Men Square 
that has practically defined Beijing duck for almost 130 years. 
</P>
<P>
 When I spotted the Rosemead branch of Quanjude a few weeks ago, I cranked a 
U-turn so fast I almost wrecked the car. The place is a new joint venture 
between the Chinese restaurant and local investors, the first in the U.S., 
perhaps inspired by the success of the nearby re-creation of the Beijing 
Muslim-style restaurant Tung Lai Shun. 
</P>
<P>
 The ornate two-story foyer, which you reach through an office-building sort of 
hall from the rear parking lot, leads to a rink-size main dining room, filled 
to the beak with people eating duck. Quanjude is a grand restaurant, rich in 
banquet rooms, decorated with duck-etched glass, decked out with pictures of 
Richard Nixon and Boutros Boutros-Ghali where other restaurants might put their 
autographed 8x10s of Ed Asner. At one end of the dining room, a chef stands on 
a raised sort of stage, receiving ducks from a steady stream of attendants, 
deftly shaving curls of skin off the ducks with a slender cleaver, tossing the 
flesh-heavy carcasses into a plastic bin behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiters already know what you want: It would be almost unthinkable to come 
to Quanjude without eating duck. Before the duck comes a small bowl of 
milk-white duck-bone broth, intensely flavored of the bird, then a couple of 
cold dishes (if you have ordered the two-appetizer, two-entree $48 Beijing duck 
dinner for four, which you probably should), maybe cool slices of braised beef 
shank or garlicky cucumber pickles or beef tripe seasoned with chiles. Then, 
very quickly, the duck: elegant, almost meatless slivers of skin that are like 
the world's best gribenes . 
</P>
<P>
 If you are not Chinese, a waiter will probably come over to show you how to 
eat the duck, how to smear a paper-thin wheat pancake with a bit of the house's 
bean sauce, top it with the white of a scallion, chopstick up a piece or two of 
the duck skin and roll it up into a kind of elegant taco. 
</P>
<P>
 The skin is crisp, giving way under your teeth like the glaze on a creme 
brulee; the sweetness of the bean sauce amplifies the duck's unctuousness like 
the glaze on a Virginia ham; the sharpness of the scallion cuts through the 
sweet richness, bringing the whole dish into balance. It is an extraordinary 
taste, a harmonious sensation that seems worth the endless rounds of massaging 
and air-drying and stone-oven roasting that are necessary to get a duck to this 
stage, worth a trip to Beijing, let alone Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
 Quanjude's Beijing duck is so remarkably superior to the Beijing ducks you 
might have grown up eating that the effect is not unlike taking a first bite of 
first-class toro sushi after a lifetime of StarKist on Wonder Bread. 
</P>
<P>
 After the duck, there is more: sliced fish and white-meat chicken, soft as 
polenta, braised with bamboo shoots in a thick, white sauce of rice-wine lees 
whose fermented sweetness ranks it a specialty on its own; cubed whitefish 
sauteed with crunchy, identical-looking cubes of fresh water chestnut; even 
kung pao chicken. Spicy dishes -- Beijing-style spicy tofu; spicy beef -- can 
be dull. 
</P>
<P>
 But Quanjude is first a palace of duck: bring nine friends and have one of the 
special all-duck banquet menus. 
</P>
<P>
 To start are duck webs, poached and neatly deboned, sauced with a tincture of 
hot mustard; duck liver poached and sliced, that tastes like a marvelous pate; 
chewy, red-cooked duck gizzards pungent with garlic and soy; spiced duck-wing 
meat, suspended in diamonds of duck-blood-tinged aspic that look like a fancy 
cocktail-hour hors d'oeuvre from a 1952 copy of Gourmet; also, maybe a 
cuttlefish salad and a plate of cucumber pickles to throw you off guard before 
the inevitable arrival of Beijing duck with all the trimmings. 
</P>
<P>
 In place of the milky duck-bone soup, there are bowls of clear, delicate 
duck-breast broth, garnished with bouquets of crunchy, slippery, essentially 
flavorless white fungus, and a few duck tongues, which have essentially the 
softness and depth of flavor that long-braised brisket has when you're in the 
right place. 
</P>
<P>
 After the duck, the duck keeps coming -- braised duck wings with baby bok 
choy; crunchy sweet-and-sour duck with chinks of pineapple; a dish of sliced 
duck hearts, tender as chicken and remarkably mild, stir-fried with chiles and 
diced sweet peppers, the sort of dish you're always hoping for when you order 
something Sichuan-style. A mound of deep-fried duck livers and gizzards seems a 
bit redundant after the braised livers and gizzards served as appetizers, but 
is surrounded with delicious, cigarette-thin egg rolls that are heady with the 
flavor of duck. Velvety duck-egg custards, garnished with a gingery sauce of 
ground duck, seems a cross between really good French oeufs a la neige and the 
postmodern "duck egg foo young" John Sedlar had on the menu at Bikini last 
year. Maybe you'll get the chicken and fish with the wine-lees sauce, or maybe 
duck meat done the same way; there will be a vegetable, perhaps straw mushrooms 
cooked with tiny marbles scooped from a winter melon. 
</P>
<P>
 But, perhaps mercifully, there is no duck sorbet. You'll get oranges and 
unsweetened yellowish squares of bean paste -- enriched with duck fat? -- that 
taste more than a little like chilled split-pea soup on a stick. 
</P>

GOOD COOKING: NEW YEAR'S; DECK THE STEW WITH CRANBERRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In spite of -- or perhaps because of -- the holiday bustle, we tend to want to 
have friends over while the house looks festive. The challenge in an impromptu 
evening of relaxed food and conversation is cooking an easy menu that reflects 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the following easy, informal meal. The "lazy person's" holiday stew 
is the focus of the menu. Unlike the usual stew in which meat is browned, 
vegetables are sauteed and the pan is deglazed, all the ingredients are simply 
mixed and put in the oven until done. It really should be made a day ahead, to 
allow the flavors to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 The mushroom noodles, which can also be done ahead, are a perfect 
accompaniment. The herb-crusted popovers are last-minute but easy.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Let the rest of the food be laissez-faire. Spiced nuts with drinks, sweet 
butter for the popovers and for dessert, Christmas cookies, or other holiday 
sweets.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 Dried cranberries give a sweet-tart finish to this robust, comforting stew.  
</P>
<P>
 LAZY PERSON'S HOLIDAY BEEF STEW 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds lean stewing beef, cut into 1 1/4-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 teaspoons dried thyme leaves 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 large bulb fennel, trimmed, cut into 12 wedges 
</P>
<P>
 9 small boiling onions 
</P>
<P>
 2 large cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 Scant 1/2 cup dried cranberries 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 cups beef broth 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup ruby Port wine 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons snipped fresh chives or minced parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Mushroom Noodles  
</P>
<P>
 Put beef, flour, thyme, salt and pepper to taste in large plastic food bag. 
Shake bag to coat beef. Transfer contents of bag including loose flour and 
seasonings to 4-quart casserole with lid. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine fennel, onions, garlic and cranberries in large bowl. Gently toss to 
mix. Add mixture to casserole, distributing evenly. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine 1 1/4 cups beef broth with wine in small bowl. Pour over stew. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake, covered, until beef is fork-tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. If after 2 hours 
there is too much liquid in casserole, remove cover last 1/2 hour. Remove 
casserole and let stew cool, loosely covered, at room temperature. Gently toss 
to mix. Refrigerate up to 3 days, but at least overnight for best eating. Let 
stew come to room temperature before reheating. 
</P>
<P>
 To reheat, cover and place on center oven rack and bake at 350 degrees until 
hot, about 30 minutes. Add more broth if needed, but wait until stew juices are 
running before deciding. Adjust seasonings to taste. Spoon stew around edge of 
large, warm platter. Garnish with chives. Fill center of platter with Mushroom 
Noodles. Serve hot. Makes 6 servings.

 These noodles are flavorful enough to be served separate from the stew, rather 
than under it, as noodles usually are. Wild mushrooms can be substituted for 
the cultivated mushrooms. The noodles are also a great accompaniment for other 
beef entrees , game and poultry . They can be made a day ahead and 
refrigerated. Let them come to room temperature and reheat in microwave oven on 
FULL power or in non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, adding more broth as 
necessary.  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 MUSHROOM NOODLES 
</P>
<P>
 16 ounces broad egg noodles  
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 16 large mushrooms, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium shallots, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup beef broth (1/4 to 1/2 cup more if reheating) 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare noodles according to package directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add 
mushrooms and shallots. Cook until heated through, about 3 minutes, stirring 
often. Add 1 cup broth. Bring to boil. Simmer until mushrooms are just tender, 
about 3 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Add cooked noodles. Heat through. Stir in butter until melted. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. Serve hot. Makes 6 servings.

 Mincing the dried herbs with the flour in a food processor or blender 
distributes their flavor throughout the popover batter. Whichever way you do 
it, the herbs end up on top, forming a most delicious crust. Through 
side-by-side testing, I've found that preheating the popover pans is 
unnecessary.  
</P>
<P>
 HERB-CRUSTED POPOVERS 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup cake flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon dried basil 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon dried oregano 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
 4 large eggs 
</P>
<P>
 Put flour, basil, oregano and salt in food processor fitted with metal blade 
or blender. Mix until herbs are pulverized. Add milk and eggs. Process just 
until combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour batter into buttered and lightly floured 6-cup popover pans, filling 
about 7/8 full. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake on center oven rack at 500 degrees 15 minutes. Do not open oven door 
during baking. Decrease heat to 350 degrees. Bake until popovers are very dark 
and crisp, about 35 minutes longer. Serve hot. Makes 6 popovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each popover contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 130 calories; 269 mg sodium; 146 mg cholesterol; 5 grams fat; 14 grams 
carbohydrates; 7 grams protein; 0.07 grams fiber.

GARDEN FRESH: NEW YEAR'S; START THE YEAR WITH BLACKEYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a motto that's good for more situations in life than you can shake a 
spoon at: Begin as you mean to go on. So, even though you hadn't planned to 
serve hoppin' John on New Year's Day, change your menu and include it.  
</P>
<P>
 Hoppin' John is a simple dish from the Carolinas: Black-eyed peas and 
long-grain rice cooked with ham hocks or bacon. Why eat beans and rice on Jan. 
1? There's a tradition in the South that if you do, you'll have luck all year 
long.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a Carolina Low Country tradition says that if you eat hoppin' John 
with a mess of greens, you'll also have financial reward in the new year. The 
greens can be collards, mustards or turnip tops -- all at their juicy best in 
winter. Simmer one-half pound smoked pork jowl or neck in four quarts water for 
half an hour until the water is flavored. Meanwhile, tear three pounds of the 
leafy parts (from five pounds of greens -- the stems are tough) into pieces the 
size of the palm of your hand. Simmer in the broth uncovered till tender. 
Collards can take a couple of hours, mustards 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 This traditional method for cooking greens is described by Hoppin' John Taylor 
in his mouth-watering book, "Hoppin' John's Low Country Cooking." Taylor says 
the rest of the New Year's Day meal should be corn bread and twice-baked sweet 
potatoes -- whole sweets baked in a hot oven until tender, cooled, then 
reheated in the oven. The double baking makes their flesh velvet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where does hoppin' John's name come from? Stories abound, but no one knows. 
Served the year round in the South, this is a dish you can indulge in and have 
no regrets. It's nourishing as can be and soul-satisfying. Of course, beans and 
rice are companions the world over. Separately, their proteins are incomplete; 
combined, the protein is of the highest quality. Hoppin' John is similar to 
chievou niebe , a West African dish. Many people believe black-eyed peas and 
the dish arrived with the slaves who worked Carolina plantations in the 17th 
and 18th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipes I've seen from across the South don't vary much: The dish is 
cooked on top of the stove. But ever since reading that dried beans are 
incomparable baked in a slow oven (without any soaking) in a covered 
earthenware dish, I'll cook them no other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Red chiles have a role in most hoppin' Johns, and I add them. But the first 
time I made the dish, I also took a leaf from a Southern cookbook that said to 
serve it with red pepper vinegar. I whomped up a batch. We sprinkled our 
hoppin' John with my vinegar and smoke came from our ears. I hooted later when 
I read the recipe in the light of day and found it called for chiles by the 
teaspoon, not tablespoon.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I break tradition by adding a California touch to our hoppin' John -- 
chopped cilantro. Its sharp spiciness gives a lift to the buckwheat-like taste 
of the beans.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of their name, black-eyed peas are not peas; neither are they beans. 
They're cowpeas, kin to the Dixie favorite, Southern peas, and the Asian 
favorite, yard-long beans.  
</P>
<P>
 Black-eyed peas are an estimable plant.  
</P>
<P>
 You can harvest its pods at the snap stage -- like any green bean -- when the 
seeds are not yet visible. They'll taste unlike any snap beans you've ever 
eaten. To me, the flavor is an irresistible blend of green bean, cucumber, 
ginger and toasted nuts. The pods especially lend themselves to cooking until 
tender-crisp in boiling salted water, being drained and dried, then sauted 
until hot in sweet butter with slivered almonds.  
</P>
<P>
 A couple of weeks after the snap bean stage, you can harvest shelly black-eyed 
peas -- when the seeds are lumpy in the pods. Although small and round, they'll 
be green and have a texture close to limas. Their flavor is that of the snap 
beans, but even more so. I simmer black-eyed shellies in a covered skillet in 
pureed fresh tomatoes thinned with water. They take a half hour to be tender. 
Delicious sprinkled with summer savory. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also roast the seeds at the shelly stage like peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks after the shell stage, when the pods are crackling dry and the 
seeds inside are cream-white with a small black eye, the pods are shelled and 
the beans stored for winter. This is when they're slowly cooked to make cozy 
dishes like hoppin' John. 
</P>
<P>
 And all the while, you can be tossing the vines' heart-shaped leaves and 
purple or yellow sweet pea-like flowers into salads. Try one part each of 
leaves, blossoms and the ruffled leaves of one pale and one red Salad Bowl 
lettuce. Dress with hazelnut oil and orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Black-eyed pea plants grow easily. They'll crop in poor soil on little water 
and in great heat, although they'll give their best when the soil is fertile 
and vines get average water. But don't add fertilizer when planting or you'll 
get leaves and no beans.  
</P>
<P>
 One thing black-eyed peas must have is warmth. Wait to sow until the soil is 
65 to 70 degrees, usually late May or June. A raised bed helps warm the earth 
(mound it four to six inches high). Be sure to order an inoculant for the 
seeds. This live bacteria makes the nitrogen in the soil available to plant 
roots. Directions for sowing will be on the package. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once sown, the plants need full sun and warm days and nights -- 65 to 75 of 
them to reach the snap bean stage. It can be four months from sowing before 
they mature to the dried bean stage. If your summers are long and hot, grow 
California Black-Eye, a sure crop. Or have the adventure of growing Guarijio 
Muni Cafe from seeds produced near the Rio Mayo in Sonora, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Where summers are cool or short, vigorous cultivars such as Black-Eye and 
Queen Anne will give you beans, although at what stage they'll be when the 
season ends, you'll have to see. 
</P>
<P>
 In the landscape, black-eyes are pretty and vigorous bushes, growing about two 
feet high with few or no runners. Grow them in beds about nine inches apart. 
Hereabouts, they're little bothered by pests and disease. Sow bright-blossomed 
verbenas around them and enjoy the butterflies.

NEW YEAR'S; MARKETS; HAVE A MOCHI NEW YEAR

 Sakura-ya, 16134 S. Western Ave., Gardena, (310) 323-7117. Hours: Wednesday 
through Monday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Closes on Sunday at 4 p.m.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Instead of luscious chocolate truffles or a good bottle of wine, you give 
mochi and manju for special occasions; they're like miniature cakes," explained 
the woman picking up her New Year order at Sakura-ya.  
</P>
<P>
 At this tiny, minimally decorated shop, the weeks before the New Year are some 
of the busiest, New Year being a very special occasion -- the time of year when 
Japanese housewives traditionally get a break from cooking. Owners Mas and Yuki 
Fujita, the two brothers who make all the Japanese confections by hand, often 
trade shifts to keep production going around the clock.  
</P>
<P>
 By 11 a.m. on a Monday the shop has the buzz of a See's Candy shop on 
Christmas Eve. A little line is beginning to form in front of the plain glass 
cases. The phone rings constantly and the sales women take orders, scribbling 
quickly on a printed form. Unflappable and unfailingly polite, they hurriedly 
gift-wrap box after precision-wrapped box, tying each paper-covered package 
with the traditional red and silver ribbons that connote happy occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mas, who's been working since 2 a.m., sticks his head out of the kitchen to 
see how many pale green mochi are left; they're running low. The pink ones are 
in short supply too. Back in the kitchen he starts working on a new batch of 
the soft, almost creamy rice cakes, folding each one to enclose a sweet 
filling. Freshness is a hallmark of this pastry, so only a few of the 
confections are kept on hand at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crafting these specialty sweets is a laborious, time-consuming endeavor -- a 
declining art on both sides of the Pacific. As mass production of traditional 
Japanese confectionery increases, you see many brands of them in all the 
Japanese grocery stores. So it seems remarkable that an old-fashioned 
family-run place like Sakura-ya, where each pastry and rice cake is made from 
scratch, can still thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 But confectioners, like sushi makers, develop their own style, and many of 
Sakura-ya's customers have shopped here since Masayasu Fujita, Mas's and Yuki's 
father, founded the business in 1956. Fujita started developing his skills in 
Japan at the age of 15 as an apprentice with old-time confectioners. He spent 
seven years at Kansen-do in Matsue, starting ith the most menial tasks and 
working his way through all the phases of pastry-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujita also perfected his art at several other Japanese shops, but 
opportunities were slim in Japan after World War II. He heard about a position 
at a shop in San Jose, whose owner was willing to sponsor a confectioner's 
immigration. So Fujita, together with his wife (who already had American 
citizenship) and their children began a new life in California.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When he wanted to open a place of his own, Fujita looked to Southern 
California to avoid competing with his San Jose employer. Gardena, with its 
burgeoning Japanese-American population, proved to have little in the way of 
Japanese confectionery shops. Fujita acquired a loan and advertised in the 
Japanese-language newspapers. "On Grand Opening day there was a line of curious 
customers who used to have to go downtown for confections," Mas remembers. "My 
father paid off his loan in just a few months and business has been steady ever 
since."  
</P>
<P>
 Customers clearly think his wares are worth a wait. "I get them for my friends 
in Seattle. They used to live in L.A. These are the mochi and manju they 
crave," said Brian Tatsuno, sporting a black T-shirt with a white Tommy Tang 
logo.  
</P>
<P>
 Troy Hashimoto, a man in his 20s, has driven up from Orange County to buy 
mochi for his parents, who used to live around here. "They love the soft, 
almost fluffy texture of these mochi , which are always very fresh," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the kind of fancifully shaped, elaborately garnished mochi you can now 
find in Asian supermarkets (even ice-cream-stuffed mochi), the kind made at 
Sakura-ya are classically simple. "We call them Gardena style," quips Mas. "We 
are known for the taste and texture of our goods, not the fanciness."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But what of the future of Sakura-ya when the old guard passes on? It seems 
many of Sakura-ya's customers are young parents, third- and even 
forth-generation Americans who are as assimilated as hot dogs. Mas says they 
bring in their children, who tell their parents they want the white mochi , 
green moch i or brown mochi , not knowing the Japanese names ( daifuku , yomogi 
, ohagi ). As one observer noted, "The language is the first in an assimilating 
culture to go; the food is the last."  
</P>
<P>
 Hand-made Japanese sweets may be a fading art, but not in Gardena, California 
at Sakura-ya. Shopping List 
</P>
<P>
 NEW YEAR SPECIALTIES 
</P>
<P>
 An essential part of any Japanese New Year celebration is plain mochi . 
Sakura-ya produces three traditional varieties.  
</P>
<P>
 Mochi -making starts with the sticky short-grained rice called mochi-gome . 
After an overnight soaking, it's wrapped in a sturdy cloth and steamed in 
wooden boxes. These are often piled five high on the special industrial-size 
rice steamers that Masayasu Fujita ordered from Japan when he started the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Next the rice must be ground to a smooth paste. Sakura-ya's one concession to 
modern technology is its automatic rice grinder. Before, the rice was placed in 
a huge granite mortar that had to be turned by hand while an electrically 
driven pestle pounded the rice. Good timing was essential for this task, which 
was clearly not without its hazards.  
</P>
<P>
 The new machine turns the rice in a huge granite bowl with a thick rotating 
paddle resembling a one-blade propeller. But the process is not completely 
automated. The rice can't be ground too long, or it will get hot and sticky. 
Too much water, or too little, will also ruin the mochi 's consistency. And 
because each rice shipment differs in water content and absorption powers, only 
skill and a practiced eye assure the perfect rice dough. 
</P>
<P>
 Komochi: These mochi , the size of silver-dollar pancakes, have an extremely 
chewy texture: "The chewier, the better," says Japanese food authority Yoko 
Nishijima. Komochi are eaten many ways, but they must first be softened by 
toasting or broiling. Toasted mochi puff up to about twice their size. "I 
microwave them for a second or two, though you don't get that nice toasty 
flavor," Nishijima admits.  
</P>
<P>
 On New Year's morning everyone eats toasted mochi in a clear soup known as 
ozoni . The hearty dish, brimming with assorted vegetables, chicken and 
sometimes shrimp, is as symbolic of Japanese New Year celebrations as roast 
turkey and pumpkin pie are to Thanksgiving. The recipe for ozoni is up to the 
cook but the toasted mochi is essential. Once the soup gets poured over the 
toasted rice cake, it must be eaten right away before the cake turns soggy.  
</P>
<P>
 New Year's Day isn't the only time for ozoni . It's a popular wintertime dish. 
"When the weather gets cold, komochi sales really increase," says Mas. We 
always keep some in our freezer." 
</P>
<P>
 Mochi , by the way, freeze very successfully -- when they thaw, they regain 
their original soft springy texture. But for some reason, refrigerating has the 
opposite effect. Refrigerated mochi stiffens and never rebounds.  
</P>
<P>
 As a dessert or between-meals snack, mochi is eaten all year long. In a 
pudding-like, sweet red bean soup called zenzai , it is a traditional winter 
sweet. Mochi lovers sandwich the rice cakes between two layers of roasted nori 
seaweed and dip them into soy sauce or they heat them in the oven and top them 
with peanut butter or even applesauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Okasane: For the Japanese, New Year celebrating goes on for about seven days, 
during which time okasane mochi , a large double-decker mochi that resembles a 
snowman, sits in a place of honor in every home. This spot may simply be a 
special corner or a more formal toko-no-ma , a little alcove that may hold a 
small Shinto shrine or altar.  
</P>
<P>
 Sitting out for so long, the okasane is likely to get a little moldy, but 
Nishijima says people simply wash off the mold and boil the mochi to soften it. 
Mas suggests that keeping the mochi in the freezer every night and bringing it 
out in the morning helps discourage mold. 
</P>
<P>
 Noshi Mochi: This mochi , from the southern part of Japan near Tokyo, comes in 
a sheet like bar cookies. It is cut in triangles for eating, but Sakura-ya 
sells the sheets uncut to help the mochi retain more freshness (you can also 
order them cut).  
</P>
<P>
 MOCHIGASHI: RICE DOUGH 
</P>
<P>
 SWEETS  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the plainer New Year's-style mochi , the dough for mochigashi is a 
blend of sweet rice flour ( mochiko ), sugar and water, and as a result it's 
softer than unsweetened mochi . The dough gets formed into shapes such as balls 
or ovals, which are often stuffed (like giant bon-bons) with a creamy paste of 
sugar and bean puree. These sweets were originally developed to complement tea, 
still their best use.  
</P>
<P>
 Pink Mochi: Like a little angelic cloud tinted the palest salmon pink, these 
kiwi-size mochi are almost fluffy, particularly after they're just made. 
Contributing to the lightness of pink mochi is its filling, a strained and 
sweetened puree of baby lima beans that seems less dense than alternative 
fillings made from sweet red adzuki beans. 
</P>
<P>
 White Mochi: With the same cloud-like exterior as pink mochi, white mochi have 
a filling based on sweet red adzuki beans. An , as sweet bean fillings are 
called, are made in both smooth and chunky varieties. Tsubu an ("bumpy an " is 
the filling in white mochi . 
</P>
<P>
 Kinako Mochi: The smooth filling here is koshi an ("strained an "). Its deep 
purple-brown color is imparted by the skins of the "red" adzuki beans as the 
beans cook. Kinako mochi gets its name from its dusting of golden roasted 
soybean powder ( kinako ).  
</P>
<P>
 Yomogi Mochi: An herb, yomogi , known unappetizingly as mugwort in English, 
gives this mochi its dusky renaissance green tint and a faint hint of herbal 
tea-like flavor. Smooth red bean an fills yomogi mochi.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange Mochi: Fujita Sr. created these mochi soon after he arrived and their 
popularity has held steady over the years. Orange mochi is unfilled pure 
unadulterated rice dough with a whisper of orange flavoring. Cut into bar 
shapes, the faintly sweet springy rectangles are dusted with a veil of potato 
starch. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohagi: In a slightly different twist on the mochi theme, this pastry is a 
snowy ball of cooked whole sweet rice grains enrobed in a thin layer of dark 
chunky adzuki an . 
</P>
<P>
 WHEAT FLOUR CAKES 
</P>
<P>
 White Manju: You know bao , those fluffy Chinese buns filled with barbecued 
pork or sometimes chicken, or sweet red beans. Well, white manju is one of its 
relatives. The tiny pastries have the same wheat dough covering (only much 
thinner) around a Ping-Pong-ball-sized mound of smooth an . The pastries are 
steamed, rather than baked, so they are snowy white with slight resiliency to 
the covering. 
</P>
<P>
 Inaka Manju: A different rendition of white manju ( inaka manju ) has the same 
steamed dough covering, but the filling is chunky, and it peeks through the 
white exterior, giving the little round cakes a ripped and ragged look. This 
undoubtedly lead to the pastry's second name, yabure manju (" torn manju "). 
</P>
<P>
 Kuri: Many Japanese sweets mimic something from nature. Kuri , for example, 
means chestnut, and its pale golden baby lima bean filling is meant to 
represent the nut. A thin layer of baked pastry with a deep chestnut-colored 
glaze of sweet rice wine encloses the filling. 
</P>
<P>
 Imo: Another example of cake-imitates-nature, imo , is a pastry that resembles 
a baked sweet potato ( imo means yam). In this case the "yam" has been slit 
open to reveal a sweet baby lima filling enriched with egg yolk. The cake 
exterior, dusted with a whisper of cinnamon, bakes to a toasty brown like a 
yam's skin.  
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese make all sorts of fruit and flower-like confections which may be 
linked to the evolution of their sweets. Before baked goods were available in 
Japan, only fresh or dried fruit were eaten as confections. When sweets were 
first introduced from China, the Japanese called them "Chinese fruit." 
</P>
<P>
 Maruyaki: Mas and Yuki decided to break with tradition when they topped these 
little cakes with a spritz of tiny chocolate chips or a scattering of peanuts. 
The bean-filled cakes are traditional in every other way: Made to resemble a 
flower, their thin cake-like exterior is classically glazed with rice wine. 
Remember, though, these maruyaki are Gardena style, so chocolate chips are OK. 
</P>
<P>
 ASSORTED SPECIALTIES 
</P>
<P>
 Kiku: Part mochi and part manju , kiku might be called the combination plate 
of Japanese sweets. A wheat pastry flour pancake as soft as velvet is folded 
over a teaspoon-sized oval of mochi filled with chunky adzuki an . A 
chrysanthemum, one of Japan's favorite flowers, is imprinted on the pancake. 
</P>
<P>
 O-Cha Manju: Stamped with the Chinese character for tea, this little cake 
looks like all the other pastry-covered manju . But its glazed exterior, a 
trompe-l'oeil , is actually made from sweet baby lima an . Inside is a smooth 
nugget of red bean an . 
</P>
<P>
 Monaka: A sort of Japanese Oreo cookie. Two crisp rice wafers that melt in the 
mouth are filled with chunky red bean an .  
</P>
<P>
 Yokan: A candy made primarily from agar-agar, a gelatin extracted from sea 
vegetables, yokan is sweetened with sugar and flavored with crushed adzuki or 
baby lima beans. If all this seems entirely too weird for the Western palate, 
think of yokan as a large gum drop. You slice off thin slivers of the 
delicate-tasting sweet to eat with tea. Each New Year, Sakura-ya makes homemade 
yokan ; the rest of the year they sell an imported Japanese version.

CULINARY SOS: AWARD-WINNING LEMON TORTE RECIPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 DEAR SOS: Will you print the first-prize winner of the lemon dessert contest 
that was recently held at the Four Oaks in West Los Angeles? It was called a 
lemon schaum torte and was wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 -- TOM 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR TOM: The dessert, which has a meringue shell and a lemon custard filling, 
comes from William Webb, an artist who decided to enter an adaptation of his 
Midwest grandmother's torte recipe in the contest. He reduced the amount of 
sugar to get a less-sweet taste. "I tried it six times before I was satisfied," 
said Webb, who won two tickets to Paris on Air France for his trouble. Four 
Oaks executive chef Peter Roelant, a seasoned classical French chef, who helped 
judge the contest was also impressed. "I gave the dessert a 10," he said. Note, 
however, that the method for making meringue -- placing it in a hot oven then 
immediately turning the heat off until the meringue sets -- takes at least 8 to 
10 hours.

 DEAR SOS: Call it nostalgia, but I want to make a meat loaf of the 1960s' 
variety -- that is the vegetarian healthy type. Do you have a favorite in your 
file? I am sure other baby boomers out there have a secret craving, too. 
</P>

WINE: WHAT MAKES A WINEMAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The image some people have of a winemaker is a person who sits around all day 
sipping various wines from different casks until inspiration, or a headache, 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who take courses in enology at accredited wine-making schools know 
that wine is far more than romance, history and artistry. A good winemaker must 
also be a chemist and microbiologist with a working knowledge of physics, 
botany, geology, meteorology, plant physiology and entymology. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the story I heard a few weeks ago of a Sonoma County winemaker, 
otherwise entirely competent, who was fired for failing to learn to drive a 
forklift. 
</P>
<P>
 Wine educators say a winemaker must make some 200 decisions on each batch of 
wine before the cork is finally, with a loud ga- chunk , plunked into the neck 
of the bottle. A misstep in any one decision, no matter how small, could create 
a problem somewhere down the line. Fortunes have been lost by such little 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, back in the late 1970s, a cellar worker at Freemark Abbey Winery 
in the Napa Valley accidentally blended some Cabernet Sauvignon into a tank of 
expensive Chardonnay. The pink-tinged Chardonnay had to be sold off as bulk 
white generic wine instead of being bottled and sold as fine Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Lapsley is a continuing education specialist in the Department of 
Viticulture and Enology at the University of California, Davis. He teaches 
courses about what can go wrong in winemaking; many of his students already 
work in wineries. I told him the story of the winemaker who lost his job 
because he couldn't drive a forklift. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true. A good winemaker has to be part mechanic," said Lapsley. "At most 
wineries, you have to know how to do basic electricity, plumbing and carpentry 
and change the parts on a bottling line. That's as important to good wine as 
having a great palate." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked him if winemakers really had to make 200 decisions before bottling a 
wine. "Is it that few?" he asked. "Hey, maybe it's a 1,000. I think you only 
had 200 decisions to make when winemaking was a lot simpler, years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other traits a good winemaker should have, Lapsley said, are a keen 
ability at sensory analysis, an understanding of statistics and scientific 
experimentation and people management skills. But chemistry and microbiology 
are at the heart of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. (Maynard) Amerine (retired chairman of the enology department at UC 
Davis) says that wine is a chemical symphony," he said, "and if that's so, it 
needs a conductor who can make all the parts play correctly so the wine tastes 
harmonious."  
</P>
<P>
 The way to play those melodies -- to make great wine consistently -- requires 
an almost fanatical attention to minute details, Lapsley said. I called a 
number of winemakers to ask their opinions of the winemaking process. Chuck 
Ortman, winemaker at Meridien Vineyards in Paso Robles: "Number one is the 
vineyard and making the decision of when to pick. I especially like going 
through the rows, tasting berries for flavor components from different blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "At lower Brix (sugar levels), you see flavors starting to develop. And 
waiting for the flavor to come up is nerve-racking. It's a waiting game that 
makes your stomach go around. You look at the skies all the time, worrying 
about rain." 
</P>
<P>
 Fermentation has its share of decisions, but the questions really begin when 
the bubbling has stopped. "Before we go into the barrels," he said, "we taste 
the different tanks and make this or that decision -- 'Oh, this tastes like the 
berries we tasted in the vineyard, so should this go into new oak, or 
one-year-old oak?' 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a set pattern on how to make each wine, sure, but you have be 
flexible. And I'm fortunate that I have a staff large enough to handle the 
details. But when I get short on people, we go out and hire more people to get 
the wine into the barrels on time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Farrell, whose Gary Farrell Wines are among the best in California, said 
winemaking is basically a matter of getting great grapes and doing as little as 
possible to them, so he won't make a wine if he can't get the right grapes. "I 
didn't make any Sauvignon Blanc in 1993 or 1994 because I couldn't get (Tom) 
Rochioli's grapes," he said. "I can make good Sauvignon Blanc from other 
grapes, but Rochioli's is so special I'd rather not make Sauvignon Blanc when I 
can't get them." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Clendenin, winemaker at Au Bon Climat in Santa Barbara County, said 
procrastination is the bane of even the best winemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me the types of decisions aren't as important as the timing stuff," said 
Clendenin, "and that becomes incredible during certain times of the year. The 
winemaker who leaves everything to the last minute and then gets behind an 
eight ball suffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it can happen to the best winemakers. He may not have enough staff and 
there's too much to do. I really think most wineries are like that. It's a 
constant dilemma, a constant battle to do things when they need doing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clendenin said he just bought a grape press that takes 25 tons at a time. 
"It's twice as big as the one at Byron (Vineyards). And we don't need it that 
big, theoretically. But we really do need it -- when it's time to move, you 
have to move. Speed and fast footwork, that's the key to good winemaking. 
Whatever talent you have, if you can't execute the decisions, everything can be 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Winemakers say that most of the major and minor decisions in a winery are not 
learned at school. Nor are they learned during harvest. They happen as a result 
of a winemaker tasting his own wine and saying, "I could have made this 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 They say most new choices are based on reading technical texts showing results 
of experiments, such as the use of different yeast strains to ferment 
Chardonnay. They also learn by talking with colleagues, attending technical 
symposiums, visiting other wine regions and playing host to visiting 
winemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 That and plenty of wine evaluation. Dennis Martin, winemaker at Fetzer 
Vineyards, said years ago that the winemakers who taste only their own wines 
aren't doing their best job. "If you taste only your own wine, you can get 
cellar-blind," he said, meaning that a winemaker's frame of reference then is 
merely his own handiwork, for better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Martin and a number of winemakers from northern Sonoma County meet regularly 
to blind-taste a wide range of wines from other wineries. Occasionally the 
group tastes wines that are not even commercially available in California, such 
as a tasting a year ago when they sampled New York State Chardonnays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to know what's out there, what the consumer is buying," said Nick 
Goldschmidt, winemaker at Simi Winery. 
</P>
<P>
 All this tasting must be done in the "off-season" -- that is, evenings and 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Every winemaker I spoke with said one decision is critical: when to harvest 
the grapes. The late Andre Tchelistcheff once said that in the weeks before 
harvest, every winemaker should be walking in the fields, tasting grapes. 
"That's where the wine is made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the harvest is imminent, with wrinkled brows winemakers take to the 
fields, sampling grapes and beginning to plan for every eventuality. And all of 
them say the same thing: Every time you think the worst is over, just wait. 
Mother Nature throws you a curve. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Clendenin, "There isn't a crystal ball in this game that works." Wines of 
the Week 
</P>
<P>
 Mumm Napa Valley Blanc de Noirs Brut ($14) -- Strawberry and spice notes in a 
faintly pink, quite dry wine with loads of character in the finish. A handsome 
wine for ringing in the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutter Home Fre ($6) : A blend of 75% Chenin Blanc and 25% Pinot Noir, this 
de-alcoholized bubbly has great spiced apple aroma and a hint of floral notes. 
Just a hint of sweetness is appealing. It's great for Asian foods as well as 
designated drivers.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: IMMIGRANTS AT HOME WITH IMPORTED SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In countries beyond our borders, the word futbol is not a misspelling of a 
beloved American pastime. In fact, when mentioned, it is in a language or 
accent other than our own and refers to a game that leaves most U. S. residents 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States may be a nation that loves sports, but on the list of 
favorites does not seem to be futbol , or soccer. Even with the full weight of 
advertising dollars and prime-time coverage behind it, sports fans and 
sportswriters in this country never got overly excited about World Cup 
coverage. Let us not forget that the World Cup was an event lassoed and dragged 
to the United States in the face of vigorous opposition by real soccer-playing 
countries, which feared that sending the world's most popular sport here was 
like staging Puccini's Tosca for an audience expecting Beavis and Butt-head. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of generalized indifference to futbol , it is thriving in many parts 
of this nation thanks to the dedication of immigrants who bring their love of 
the game with them. 
</P>
<P>
 In this county, there are 200 recreational soccer teams made up of 4,500 
players sanctioned by the California Soccer Assn. Most players, it turns out, 
are foreign-born, largely from Mexico. This is a fact that was of great 
interest to staff writer Pancho Doll, who wrote this week's Centerpiece story. 
He originally stumbled upon this story not by kicking a soccer ball around, 
but, instead, by hitting the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got on this story because of something I read in the 1990 census," he said. 
"The report said that Hispanic males between the ages of 18 and 44 outnumber 
Hispanic women in Ventura County by 8,350. I figured there must be some result 
of the gender disparity, so I started hanging out at soccer fields and talking 
to the players. That's where I learned that many of them were pals from Mexico. 
I decided that the better story was to write about soccer and its role in 
immigrant society." 
</P>
<P>
 Doll discovered that soccer is more than just a sport in Mexico, it is at the 
center of life. He also found that when players come to this country, neither 
their camaraderie nor their competitiveness diminishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent some time in Spain and Venezuela where futbol is the sport, but what 
I like about the recreational leagues here is that, although the standard of 
play may not be the highest, spectators can be right there on the bench when 
the play comes down the sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Doll spent a number of weeks with local soccer players, did he manage to 
get drafted to a team? 
</P>
<P>
 "The bench is a familiar place for me," Doll said. "When I was younger, I 
played soccer and I played it very badly. After an undistinguished prep career, 
my highest achievement came in the Navy, where I was the last man to be cut 
from the team. After three weeks of practice, the last spot was between me and 
one other guy. In the final scrimmage before the season started, the other guy 
accidentally scored a goal for the opposing side. But I was so awful that the 
coach gave him the spot."

SOUNDS: 1994'S MUSICAL HIGH NOTES; IT WAS MARKED BY PRESENTATIONS AT THE NEW 
THOUSAND OAKS CIVIC ARTS PLAZA, FINE SYMPHONIC CONCERTS AND LOTS OF GOOD JAZZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whatever else may have happened, 1994 in Ventura County will be remembered as 
the Year of the Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 First there came the rippling metal fabric of the copper curtain, a dramatic 
display visible to travelers on the Ventura Freeway. Not long after, the actual 
curtain rose and the portals flung open at the Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand 
Oaks. A crown jewel came to town. 
</P>
<P>
 We watched it grow from the ground up, we road-weary commuters flying past 
T.O. From the skeletal stage through the completion of the fortress-like mass, 
the Civic Arts Plaza became a conspicuous symbol of high hopes for cultural 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, as of October, the county had itself a new edifice for the arts. It's 
too early to say what the long-range effects will be, or whether the 
programming will venture outward from its so-far middle-of-the road path. But, 
as a symbol of cultural potential, it refuses to be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the place is both a boon and a boot for the Conejo Symphony 
Orchestra. The official resident orchestra of the venue faces the challenge of 
honing its wares to an ever higher level and also attending to the basic 
necessity of attendance. The orchestra must draw a larger house than it was 
accustomed to in its previous stomping grounds at Cal Lutheran University. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in other parts of the county, the Ventura County Symphony continued 
its adventures under the skilled guidance and avuncular charm of Boris Brott, 
now in the midst of his third season. Last spring, Brott marshaled the 
enticing, exotic "Musics Alive!" series at various spots around the county, 
celebrating world music traditions of China, India and Indonesia, and weaving 
in work of contemporary composers. Encore. 
</P>
<P>
 The symphony's season began on shaky ground, in a bout of contract 
negotiations with musicians. Dealing with increasingly accomplished ranks of 
musicians has enhanced the orchestra's quality, and touchy professional 
dealings may be one side effect that the local symphony hadn't bargained for. 
Tangling, and finally tangoing, the season thankfully commenced. 
</P>
<P>
 The resident Music Man of the Year award has to go to Miguel del Aguila, the 
Uruguayan-born, Oxnard-based composer of considerable imagination and 
cross-cultural literacy. Aguila has had his work performed around the world, in 
New York this fall, and had a strong presence in the county this year. 
</P>
<P>
 To its credit, the Ventura County Symphony kicked off its season in October 
with a world premiere of Aguila's enjoyable and sinewy "Conga," which asks the 
orchestra to cross a formal line between European symphonic manners and South 
American dance band spunk. The work affirms Aguila's gift for contemporary 
music that is at once cerebral and punchy enough to appeal to even new music 
skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Aguila extracted materials from his yet-to-be produced opera 
"Cuauhtemoc," which was premiered by the Ojai Camarata at the Ojai Presbyterian 
Church in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of Ojai, it is there at the beginning of every summer that Ventura 
County makes its presence known to the international music world. The Ojai 
Festival took over the town for the 48th time. Returning to the Libbey Bowl 
where he alighted decades earlier, music Director Michael Tilson Thomas led a 
weekend that was, by the Ojai Fest standards, surprisingly conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, 20th-Century repertoire met the venerable stuff of Brahms, Bach and 
Schubert, pleasing some -- who complain that the Ojai Fest is too modern-minded 
-- and perplexing others who feel that Ojai's agenda is to give much-needed 
equal time to contemporary work. The best music came with spicy old/new 
mergers, such as Lukas Foss' "Phorion" and Luciano Berio's "Rendering." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the year in jazz in the county, it was a veritable bumper crop. 
Wheeler Hot Springs continued its pattern of bringing jazz notables to its 
creekside idyll up Maricopa Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Things got off to a rousing start, with Joe Henderson in January. Also on the 
1994 roster were the fine alto saxophonist Bobby Watson, vibist Terry Gibbs, 
and a reunion of comrades, guitarist Robben Ford and pianist Roger Kellaway, 
who joined the ranks of artists taking up residence in Ojai this year. 
</P>
<P>
 There was jazz activity worth checking out in the lowlands as well, 
specifically with the regular jazz policy at 66 California in Ventura. The 
guest list at the 66, sitting in with the in-house support system of Johnny 
Veith's trio, was highlighted by stellar L.A.-based sax players Harold Land and 
Pete Christlieb. 
</P>
<P>
 The new jazz club on the block, Friends and Strangers in Ventura, has made a 
valiant attempt at doing the right thing since its opening in the fall. It's a 
fine showcase setting, with a well-equipped stage and sound system, and the 
musical menu leans toward the funk-groove end of the jazz cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
 In the idiomatic cracks, we heard good sounds from Gene Bowen, whose 
iridescent and pleasantly un-categorized new-world music project "The Vermilion 
Sea" was released on the Gyroscope label. Bowen has been working on the album, 
which features his old pal Harold Budd and the gifted Piru-based percussionist 
John Bergamo, for a few years now, dating back to when he had a home studio in 
Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 And what would a musical year in Ventura be without a new piece by Jeff 
Kaiser? The iconoclastic composer-performer always seems to have a healthy 
supply of ideas, leaning toward the experimental end of the cultural spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides continuing work with his improvisation-fueled trio, Mahacuisinart, 
Kaiser staged his electro-acoustic chamber opera "Aurea Catena" at the Odd 
Fellow's Lodge in April, keeping to his timetable of presenting a new 
composition every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever one thought of the work's dense rhetoric, based on alchemical texts, 
it boasted some of Kaiser's most striking electronic conjuring yet. It also 
provided a strong vehicle for soprano Liz Stuart, who moved to San Francisco 
this year, leaving a vocal void in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, Ventura County's musical scene was one of raised curtains and hopes. 
So much for any lingering notions that this broad stretch of Southland is a 
cultural wasteland.

NIGHT LIFE: CANNON STILL GETS BANG OUT OF SINGING; HE'LL REPRISE SOME OF HIS 
CHART-TOPPING HITS FROM LATE '50S AND EARLY '60S AT THE THOUSAND OAKS CIVIC 
ARTS PLAZA ON NEW YEAR'S EVE. 
</P>

<P>
 Before MTV, CDs and FM radio that mattered, there was the three-minute song, 
the sock hop, AM radio that mattered and the first generation of rock stars. 
Like Freddy (Boom Boom) Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon scored a national hit in 1959 with "Tallahassee Lassie." A string of 
hits followed, leading Cannon to a record 110 appearances on "American 
Bandstand." 
</P>
<P>
 On New Year's Eve at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, Cannon will be 
showcasing some hits of wild rockers from the days when even your parents swore 
they were cool. Several other acts that live long and prosper on AM radio will 
also perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Well she comes from Tallahassee , 
</P>
<P>
 She's got a hi-fi chassis , 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe looks a little sassy , 
</P>
<P>
 but to me she's real classy.  
</P>
<P>
 So sang Cannon, a man of keen perception and unassailable logic. Cannon, whose 
early hits were on Swan Records, moved west in the early '60s and signed with 
Warner Bros., never losing his accent or his allegiance to those Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the singer discussed what's what from his Tarzana home. 
</P>
<P>
 You've been out here a long time. Has it been long enough to root for the 
Dodgers if there were a Boston versus L.A. World Series? 
</P>
<P>
 I've been out here about 32 years, but I'm for the Red Sox -- can't beat the 
Red Sox. I hear they just signed Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
 What was the Boston scene like in 1957? 
</P>
<P>
 It was all doo-wop then. I was a young kid, 16-17 years old, working after 
school driving a truck for a hardware store. I was in a band with four or five 
other guys doing covers of other people's songs. In 1957, I wrote and sang a 
song called "Cha Cha Do." The name didn't mean anything; it was just a dumb 
thing, but the song was a hit in Boston and sold about 5,000 copies on Hot 
Records -- if anyone has one of those 45s, let me know. Then I played guitar on 
a record called "Ka Ding Dong" for a band called the G-Cleffs. They gave me 20 
bucks and the song went to No. 3 in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 So did you get ripped off for money like a lot of the other early artists? 
</P>
<P>
 I never got what I was supposed to get. It seemed like I always owed the label 
money. After "Palisades Park," which was a big hit, I still owed the label 
$20,000. But there was no one for me to sue because Swan disbanded. But all of 
that taught me the business. 
</P>
<P>
 What was it like being a teen idol? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think I ever considered myself a teen idol. The teen idols were 
Frankie Avalon, Fabian, Ricky Nelson, Dion and Bobby Rydell. I was always the 
hard-rock rock 'n' roller of my time. I was the raw Rolling Stones type. My 
early records such as "Tallahassee Lassie" sound like the early Stones. But I 
wasn't the first -- Little Richard, he's our leader, and Jerry Lee Lewis, too. 
They set the stage; we were like their students. 
</P>
<P>
 And screaming girls were eyeing you? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh yeah, we got a lot of that. One time, at a state fair in Michigan, they put 
us up in these trailers, and the kids found us. They used hatchets and 
screwdrivers to try to get in through the roof while others were underneath 
trying to get in through the floorboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell me about a sock hop. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were great opportunities for a band to build on. A disc jockey would be 
hired to go to a high school. I remember back in Boston, Arnie Ginsberg would 
be there with his records, and he'd jam five to seven thousand kids in the gym 
at a buck a head. The deejay really helped you then. He would play your record, 
then you'd come out and do it live or sometimes lip sync it. Usually, we'd do 
live shows just for gas money. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you get signed to Swan Records? 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, deejays had the power to play what they wanted to play. I gave 
Arnie Ginsberg this reel-to-reel tape of "Tallahassee Lassie," but then it was 
called "Rock 'n' Roll Baby." So he gave it to some producers, Bob Crew and 
Frank Slay, who took it to New York and reworked it. It was a big hit. All the 
songs on my first album, "The Explosive Freddy Cannon," were named after 
cities, and the third single, "Way Down Yonder in New Orleans," was a monster. 
When you're young and you hear your record on the radio, there's nothing like 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Describe Freddy Cannon music. 
</P>
<P>
 It's danceable music that's fun, very upbeat and happy. I like people to have 
fun with me. I work very hard and I enjoy what I'm doing. It's not a put-on. I 
want to have a party: If you don't, you don't belong here. My music isn't for 
people who sit there and stare at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it a mistake to sign with Warner Bros. and move west? 
</P>
<P>
 Not at all. It was a beautiful move for me to go with Warner Bros. I moved to 
California, and except for the earthquakes, everything is great. It's a great 
label and everyone treated me very well. The first record I gave them was 
"Abigail Beecher," which was a hit. Everyone, of course, wants to have another 
hit record. My last one that charted was in 1981, a song called "Let's Put the 
Fun Back in Rock 'n' Roll," recorded with Dion's old band, the Belmonts. It got 
to No. 71, then it fell off. 
</P>
<P>
 What's it like doing revival shows? 
</P>
<P>
 They're fun. But the only thing I don't like is when there's eight or 10 acts, 
you only get to do about 20 minutes, four or five songs. So, you've got to do 
it, then get off. I don't have a hit record now, but I'm working as much as 
anyone else. I work hard and the people know it. When I'm out there, I give 
150%. The way I see it, if you don't sweat, you're not a rock 'n' roller. I'm 
doing a 22-day tour of the Midwest starting in April. I usually work every 
weekend, and I'm usually home during the beginning of the week. I also do a lot 
of corporate dates, the Diners Club, Ford dealers, stuff like that. Then, in 
the summer, I do a lot of fairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there anything you'd change in your career? 
</P>
<P>
 I think I would probably do the same thing. I'd like to have had the knowledge 
I have now when I was 15 years old, but you can't do that. The music business 
has given me a lot of chances and opportunities. I'm going to have a new album 
coming out on Rhino in January or February with 20 songs on it. I have a 
beautiful family. I'm doing well and I'm really happy. Details

WORDS & IMAGES: LEARNING ALL ABOUT WRITING IS KIDS' STUFF AT THESE SEMINARS; 
SOCIETY OF CHILDREN'S BOOK WRITERS AND ILLUSTRATORS WILL HOLD THREE SESSIONS 
FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO WRITE FOR YOUNGSTERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Part of the writing business is attending classes, seminars and conferences to 
help hone skills and develop contacts. Consider the following opportunities: 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura/Santa Barbara Region of The Society of Children's Book Writers and 
Illustrators will host three seminars to help people who write, or want to 
write, books for children. Members will share their expertise on how to connect 
with other writers and form critique groups. Participants can bring manuscripts 
(up to 10 pages) to be critiqued in small group sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshops will meet on Sundays from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. The first is 
scheduled Jan. 8 in the Simi Valley Library Community Room, 2969 Tapo Canyon 
Road; on Jan. 15 in the Faulkner Gallery of the Santa Barbara Central Library, 
40 E. Anapamu St., and on Feb. 5 at Adventures for Kids, 3457 Telegraph Road, 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The sessions are free. Reservations are required. For further details, call 
Alexis O'Neill at 581-1906, or write to the group at 1001 Hillview Lane, Simi 
Valley, 93065. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Ann Jones, writer/actress and teacher of advanced screenwriting at 
the USC Graduate Film School, will conduct an intensive weekend workshop on 
Writing the Screenplay from 9 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., Jan. 14-15, at the Ojai Art 
Center, 113 S. Montgomery St., Ojai. Aimed at both beginning and advanced 
writers, the workshop will focus on how to choose a good story, how to 
structure plot, develop characters, create dialogue and sell a screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 The class, which is sponsored by the Ojai Film Society, is limited to 20 
participants. Cost is $125 before Sunday and $150 afterward. Contact Steve 
Grumette at 649-4000 any Saturday through Monday, or call the Film Society 
office at 646-8946. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Friendly Book Discussion Group sponsored by Friends of the Thousand Oaks 
Library will discuss "Native Son" by Richard Wright. Ruth Smith will lead the 
group, which meets at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in the Goebel Senior Center, located 
next door to the library, 1401 E. Janss Road. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Be it resolved that the good people who write press releases in 1995 will 
include information -- like addresses. Please don't assume that everybody knows 
the location of the library, mall, restaurant, community house or theater where 
your events take place. Y'all have a swell New Year.

CENTERPIECE: RALLY 'ROUND THE BALL; SOCCER CLUBS SERVE AS EXPATRIATE 
COMMUNITIES FOR MANY LATINOS, OFFERING CAMARADERIE AND CONNECTIONS TO THE 
PRESENT, AS WELL AS THE PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All sports have their songs: the smack of hickory on horsehide, the crack of 
colliding polyethylene helmets, the swish of a basketball through a net. But to 
the thousands of Spanish-speaking futbol players who spend their winters 
de-thatching public fields across the county, soccer is the sound of tearing 
grass and the sweet, sweet thump of leather inflated to 10 pounds of pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Ramirez got thumped particularly hard. At an early-season game in 
Oxnard, he was playing for his team, Villa Jimenez, when an opposing player -- 
a guy with a right foot like a cinder block -- booted the ball straight into 
Ramirez's groin. As Ramirez doubled over, he drew reflexive winces from players 
on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates helped him off the field, but as his injured area continued to 
fill with fluid, friends decided he needed a trip to the hospital. One trip 
turned into three as doctors repeatedly had to drain the severe bruise. Medical 
insurance covered the hospital bill, but with little in personal savings, 
Ramirez, a 27-year-old Oxnard factory worker, had to depend on the same friends 
who carried him off the field to pick up his expenses during his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 It never occurred to anyone that things could be otherwise. That's because 
most of the men on Villa Jimenez are from the same town in Mexico, a town 
named, you guessed it, Villa Jimenez. And, like dozens of other soccer clubs in 
the county, the team forms an expatriate community that, in addition to acting 
as a mutual-aid society, serves as a job-referral agency, housing locater and 
basic social unit, second only to family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's natural," said Sigifredo Ambriz, captain of Villa Jimenez. "If you just 
came to this country and you don't know a lot of people, you go out and kick 
around the ball with guys from home." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Soccer Assn. sanctions 200 adult recreational soccer teams in 
the county. League officials say that of the 4,500 registered players, the 
majority are foreign, mostly from Mexico. The club rosters contain the names of 
so many Mexican cities and towns that they look like index pages from a road 
atlas. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is no surprise that big cities such as Guadalajara, Morelia and 
Mexico City have exported enough native sons here to fill out an 18-man club, 
what's remarkable is the number of small towns -- some too little to appear on 
standard maps -- that even supply players for more than one team in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Copandaro, a settlement of 6,000 people in the state of Michoacan, has two 
teams in the Ventura County League. So does Villa Jimenez (population 20,000). 
And the somewhat larger town of Tecalitlan in the state of Jalisco has a couple 
of clubs in the Thousand Oaks League. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican immigrants tend to have great sentiment for their town or province of 
origin, said Samuel Mark, a USC professor who specializes in Latino culture in 
Southern California. Other nationalities also form teams based on their country 
of origin, but usually only Mexicans field teams based on small geographic 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tend to trust the people from their hometown," Mark said. "It makes 
sense that they join others where some have settled, and that they help each 
other as the need arises." 
</P>
<P>
 There's even a word for it: paisano.  
</P>
<P>
 That sort of trust and cooperation can grow into immigration chains -- or 
networks -- which, according to experts, can accelerate immigration, 
particularly from small towns. Douglas Massey, co-author of "Return to Aztlan," 
a book about U.S.-Mexican immigration, said that without such contacts it would 
be much harder for new arrivals to connect. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas most Mexican towns have a market or a central square where people go 
to meet, Massey pointed out that American cities have only street corners and 
supermarkets with "No Loitering" signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of people, the first thing they do when they get to a new place is 
go to these soccer fields and look for familiar place names," Massey said. 
"That's why soccer is important . . . because the games have regular meeting 
times. They're a place where people can go and exchange information." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as soccer plays a key role in integrating immigrants into their new 
community, the game also forms some of the older links in the immigration 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these young guys you see playing out here, we know their fathers," 
said Efrain Moreno, 43, president of a Thousand Oaks team composed almost 
entirely of men from Tecalitlan. "I've got a nephew playing on this team who 
wasn't even born when I came here in the '70s and started playing." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, soccer is the main reason some men come to the United States. 
Coaches for semi-pro teams keep an eye on developing talent in Mexico. If they 
find a promising player, they often encourage him to come north. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Munoz, a 31-year-old practical nurse at St. John's Pleasant Valley 
Hospital who plays for Villa Jimenez, said he was recruited by Zaragosa, a 
semi-pro team in Santa Barbara's Central Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave me money for the plane ticket to come here, money for uniforms and 
a place to stay for a couple of months until I started working," Munoz said. "I 
got my first job through the team, washing dishes. Then they got me a job 
waiting tables, then one working at a nursing home." He estimates the team 
spent about $1,000 on him and gave him a performance incentive of $50 per goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Expatriates from all over the soccer-playing world, which is to say all over 
the world, form teams in Southern California. Among teams from England, 
Germany, Holland and Central American countries, probably the best-known is The 
Exiles, which started in 1975 when some British expatriates in the music 
business got together in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Rod Stewart, Hamish Stuart from Average White Band, myself and some 
other Brits," said Exiles President Lionel Conway, head of Madonna's record 
label, Maverick. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the blue-collar Latino teams, it's the club's president, often a former 
player, who pays much of the team's $1,000 to $2,000 annual cost for uniforms, 
insurance and other expenses. In contrast, Conway spends $10,000 a year on his 
team, earning The Exiles a reputation as the glamour boys of Southern 
California amateur soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Exiles come up here from L.A. once in a while," said Ramon Arcero, 
registrar for the local chapter of the California Soccer Assn. "Once, all of 
them showed up in limousines, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 Conway got a kick out of that one. "I would think we're financially better off 
than most teams," he said, "but we don't travel to games in limousines. I think 
Rod might have taken a limo to a game in Oxnard once, but that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all local games have the star power of a Rod Stewart taking a corner kick. 
Weekend matches in county parks and schoolyards each draw an average of about 
100 fans. Top-level teams will bring out about 500 people, and tournament 
finals can get crowds of a couple of thousand, club officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of those spectators will be Anglos. And maybe that's because to understand 
local soccer -- to really appreciate the tableau -- you have to know something 
about the lyrical qualities of cursing in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not enough to call the ref a billy goat of dubious parentage and impaired 
judgment. Truly effective profanity employs poetic devices. Word choice is 
important, naturally. But it's the way the words fit into the delivery that 
affects the quality of the invective. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, when a linesman blows the whistle on a breakaway because your 
team's forward is offside, the disgusted observer would use a simple phrase: 
</P>
<P>
 " El jodido juez de linea ." (That damn linesman.) 
</P>
<P>
 But really successful cursing requires a tonic accent. You raise the tone of 
the syllables to give them emphasis. The best example of this is the use of 
arbitro , Spanish for referee. When it comes at the end of the sentence and the 
tone is raised on the first two syllables "ar-bi," it builds suspense for the 
"troooooo" decrescendo, thereby producing a harangue: 
</P>
<P>
 "No tiene madre! Una tia se le partio. Jodido ar-bi-troooooooo ." (He doesn't 
even have a mother. An aunt had to give birth to him. The damn referee!) 
</P>
<P>
 However satisfying the jeer feels on the tongue, it can result in a technical 
foul if the referee decides to penalize the team, as much as $50, for its fans' 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, (fines happen) pretty often," Delgado said. "The fans get noisy." 
</P>
<P>
 They are noisiest during matches that feature rivalries from Mexico -- 
cross-town antagonisms from the homeland are vigorously pursued here. 
</P>
<P>
 Natives of Tecalitlan split into two teams just a year ago. Efrain Moreno's 
team, San Isidro, takes its name from an old neighborhood in the city of 
Tecalitlan. Their archrival still uses the city's name. They've played just 
once, last year in Thousand Oaks, and San Isidro was victorious, 1-0, in a 
battle that produced several yellow cards (warnings for rough play) and a 
couple of red-card expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the hottest rivalry is between Copandaro and Villa Jimenez. Villa 
Jimenez is the seat of local government in the municipo (the Mexican equivalent 
of a county) in which Copandaro is located. Those from Villa Jimenez charge 
that, because such a high percentage of Copandaro natives work in this country 
and send money home, the town is flooded with expensive consumer goods and U.S. 
currency. Copandaros, it is said, have an air of economic superiority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it Dollar City," Delgado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how many red cards will be handed out in February when Copandaro plays 
La Villa, Delgado replied, his face brightening: "Several." 
</P>
<P>
 The holidays mark the midpoint of the nine-month season. League play slows 
down for Christmas and so do the individual players. Cold weather means muscles 
have to be warmed up, and night games on winter weekends are not favored by men 
who come from places where the mercury drops below freezing maybe once every 
100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Liniment gets slathered on before the game and brandy takes away the chill 
after night games. When games are played during the day, the preferred 
post-game potable is beer. At game's end, before the sweaty shirts and cleats 
come off, the players engage in the latest round of the league's most enduring 
rivalry -- Miller vs. Bud. 
</P>
<P>
 After a weekend practice game at McKinna School in Oxnard, a man who showed up 
with a case of Budweiser was roundly hazed by others with Miller in their 
hands. The reason: Bud-maker Anheuser-Busch contributed to the campaign of Pete 
Wilson and other pro-Proposition 187 candidates, and Latino activists have 
called for a boycott of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The man carrying the Bud tried to defend himself, pointing out that Bud is one 
of the league's sponsors, but sentiments against 187 are running so high that 
he was overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, a compromise was reached: Everyone agreed that 187 is a bad thing 
and, after a moment's reflection, they decided to drink the Budweiser last.

ROCK TALK; LOCAL BANDS LEAVE THEIR MARK ON 1994; GROUPS FROM SIMI VALLEY TO 
SANTA BARBARA HAVE PLENTY OF RECORDINGS IN AREA STORES WELL WORTH ADDING TO 
YOUR MUSIC COLLECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Eddie Vedder, Mariah Carey and the Eagles have enough money. Local musicians 
don't. They need your support, otherwise they may have to get real jobs. Then 
your pizza will be late, your burger won't be done your way, misguided lawn 
mowers will behead your sprinklers, and worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The 805 area code is fairly teeming with underappreciated but in no way 
untalented musicians. Here's an alphabetical sampling of a dozen memorable 1994 
releases. Your so-called record collection will be seriously lacking without 
these, all of which are available at local music stores. 
</P>
<P>
 April's Motel Room -- "Black 14" (Immortal) 
</P>
<P>
 After a million gigs in El Lay, these Simi Valley rockers got a deal with an 
Epic-affiliated label. Their debut has cool college rock written all over it. 
The band had a spot on the recent HORDE tour, and front man Tom Kelly showcased 
that MTV voice. "Get Her Way" is the most memorable one here, and seems radio 
ready if not for all those deaf radio programmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Bad Voodoo Daddy -- "Big Bad Voodoo Daddy" (Big Bad Records) 
</P>
<P>
 These guys dress up as if they fell out of some '40s film noir gangster flick, 
but they add some '90s rock to swing music that really swings. Guitar whiz 
Scott Morris writes most of the songs. He knows what he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Evil Farmer -- "Nice" (Stone Dwarf) 
</P>
<P>
 Not Porky Pig's conception of Farmer John, but rather four music majors from 
UCSB who prove positively that they took good notes in class. Jazzy and spacey, 
these guys change gears more often than a kid driving his first stick shift, 
but it works. 
</P>
<P>
 Lion I's -- "Original Style" (Po Folk) 
</P>
<P>
 They've been around for a long time, and their CD party at the Ventura Theatre 
a few months back was a sellout. Once a reggae-powered dance band, Lion I's now 
incorporates a variety of styles, yet the dance floor remains packed. Bobby 
Galyan is a charismatic front man and "Sweet Summer," "Gimme Some Time" and 
"Pressure" are certifiable foot movers. And finally Orange County can join the 
rest of us in singing the workingman's theme song, "I'm So Poor." 
</P>
<P>
 Little Jonny and the Giants -- ALBUM Telecaster Music (Cornbread) 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like the band a lot better if it was Little Jonny and the Dodgers, but 
aside from that, the players in this blues band are so smooth you don't at 
first notice how good they are. Nothing pretentious, just good rockin' blues 
made for dancing, and none of that cryin' in your beer boring blues, either. A 
bunch of showoffs, these guys also do folk, country, zydeco and you name it. 
</P>
<P>
 Majority Dog -- "Mister Night" (Majority Dog) 
</P>
<P>
 This is tight folk rock all the way from Newbury Park. Brian Wurschum is a 
clever writer with a clear, cool voice, with April and Laurel Hoffman 
contributing to creating some nifty three-part harmonies. Most bands have no 
good singers; the Dog band has three. Also, this is the first local band to get 
a gig at the Civic Arts Plaza, and it's deserved. "Big Black Car" rocks best 
but there's nothing close to a bad cut on this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinching Judy -- "More Like Morphine" (Meltdown Records) 
</P>
<P>
 They've been around so long they used to be somebody else, Something For 
Nothing. Loud and hard, slow and mellow, with vein-popping front man John 
Lombardo constantly in danger of exploding and messing up your CD player. Hey, 
he's into it. On the verge of being signed for a while now, these guys write 
better songs than those other alternative/grunge/what-the-hell college radio 
bands. They must have at least 50 songs. "Land of Me" should be worth half of 
Soundgarden's time on MTV. Harsh but sweet, like a leather Twinkie. 
</P>
<P>
 Popsicko -- "Off To A Bad Start" (Sick Music) 
</P>
<P>
 Living up to its name and then some, these Santa Barbara pop rockers evoke 
memories of the late great Plimsouls, except with more (and better) guitars. 
Keith Brown is clearly the master of the three-minute pop gem -- "Getting Used 
to You," "Same Old Me" and "Dragging Me Down" provide further proof. The CD 
should be out next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Raging Arb & the Redheads -- "Raging Arb & the Redheads" (Joker Disc) 
</P>
<P>
 Since I have 16 different Arb T-shirts, two sweat shirts, three baseball caps, 
a jacket and a sticker on my car, it's tough to be objective about the best 
local, and my favorite, band. Six guys, 11 years, one CD -- they finally have 
it figured out. Rock, blues, a little twang, some punk and bunches of good 
songs by Toby Emery, such as "Casting Shadows," "Cup O' Joe" and "Fool's Gold." 
</P>
<P>
 This Ascension -- "Walk Softly A Dream Lies Here" (Tess) 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Dru is so enigmatic she makes Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star and Tori Amos 
look like a couple of cheerleaders. If you're all dressed in black, think dates 
are something that grow on trees and "ethereal" has a special meaning for you, 
well then, here's your soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Toad The Wet Sprocket -- "Dulcinea" (Columbia) 
</P>
<P>
 Well, these S.B. rockers, who used to open for the Mudheads and the I-Rails, 
don't need any money. They've been on the Letterman show, and this album 
shipped gold, making Toad the most successful band in the 805 area code. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoo Story -- "Laughter Forgetting" (Zoo Story) 
</P>
<P>
 It's upbeat pop rock from this Westmont College band that is reminiscent of 
the Three O'Clock, particularly with Raymond George's high voice. You can't go 
wrong with a band that has a guitarist named Will Rainbow.

VIDEO REWIND; EARLY FELLINI MOVIE TAKES A CLOSE LOOK AT RECKLESS YOUTH; THE 
GENTLY SARCASTIC 'I VITELLONI,' MADE IN 1953, EXPLORES THE LIVES OF FIVE YOUNG 
MEN WHO SEEM STUCK IN PERPETUAL ADOLESCENCE.

<P>
 There's not much action in "I Vitelloni," one of Federico Fellini's earliest 
and finest films about coming of age in southern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the ever-present narrator tells us at one point that the only news 
worth reporting in the lives of the five young men at the center of Fellini's 
1953 movie is this: "In the next few months, the most important things that 
happened were that Riccardo grew a mustache and Alberto grew sideburns, while 
Fausto shaved his mustache off." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that bit of info is pure irony, for in "I Vitelloni," Fellini is 
actually looking closely at what makes Riccardo (Riccardo Fellini, the 
director's brother), Alberto (Alberto Sordi), Fausto (Franco Fabrizi), Moraldo 
(Franco Interlenghi) and Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste) tick. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture, whose title loosely translates into "The Big Loafers," is an 
insightful and gently sarcastic take on men in perpetual adolescence -- doing 
nothing out on the corner, chasing girls and avoiding as much responsibility as 
they can. They don't work, and you wonder if they'll ever grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 We first see them cruising down a town square. The narrator lets us know that 
Fausto is the group's "leader and spiritual guide," a snide crack, considering 
that the womanizing Fausto is, at the moment, trying to pick up a woman. Fausto 
eventually gets another girl pregnant and they have to marry, causing assorted 
complications. He still chases other women, though, often with his pals at his 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 The imagery is, as usual with Fellini, colorful and more than a little sexy. 
An especially wild scene at a carnival foreshadows Fellini's later fascination 
with anything circus-like. It also shows just how foolish these youths can be; 
the actors, although relatively inexperienced, are all first rate at being 
callow. 
</P>
<P>
 But even when having fun with who they are, Fellini is rarely cruel. We go 
along with him in this casual dissection, realizing that they may all be a bit 
ridiculous, but they're also likable and genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I Vitelloni" (1953), directed by Federico Fellini, 104 minutes. Not rated.

ON THE ROAD: FLYING FISH MEET SAILING SHIPS AT MARITIME DISPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the center of Fisherman's Wharf is the Ventura County Maritime Museum, 
repository of ship models and paintings done in excruciating detail. The 
displays are not exactly Easy Listening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Genealogy of the Ship," for example, traces all modes of transit over water 
from 4,000 B.C. through today in a 36-model collection. A lighter display, by 
contrast, might show photographs of Port Hueneme's current role as host to 
Wallenius Lines' cargo ships -- cargo ships so vast, so huge, so heavy as to 
contain 6,300 automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when you think it's all about displacement and ballast and screw size, 
magic floats down from the ceiling: silk banners. Seemingly weightless, 
diaphanous and brightly colored, these silk banners have fish painted on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 20 banners is about 18 inches wide by three or four feet tall. 
Each bears one large, vertically positioned fish in luminous blue, green, 
yellow, crimson, pink, cobalt -- it depends upon whether the fish is a leopard 
shark, yellow striped sheepshead, green striped grunt, sea bass, hummu nuku or 
great white shark. The fish are starkly and beautifully wrought and somewhat 
representational. 
</P>
<P>
 But look long enough and you'll see they're jiggered and distorted and 
tweaked, always, in service to showing off color and form. In this sense the 
fish banners leave the realm of the purely decorative and become art. 
</P>
<P>
 Five points to an otherwise barnacled museum. Nothing leavens a 1909 painting 
of the New York, a dark-hued steamer on brooding seas by Hoboken, N.J., artist 
Antonio Jacobsen, than a happily distorted and winsome portrait of a neon pin 
stripe grunt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each banner is signed by Natasha, who actually is Natalie Wilson of Santa 
Barbara. Wilson has been painting on silk for some time. But these banners are 
a specific grouping from a specific technique that took time to evolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the "painted" silk available these days is accomplished by successive 
immersion of the silk in different dyes. Wilson instead keeps the colors 
separate by using a resist solution to contain dyes that she applies directly 
to the fabric; that is, she's figured out what it takes to paint on silk as she 
would on canvas. No blurring. Distinct images. 
</P>
<P>
 The silk is then steam-set for four hours or more to help the dyes resist 
fading, followed by a pressing. The resulting colors are deep, vivid, luminous. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson trained at San Jose State University and UC Santa Barbara and for some 
time thought of herself as an abstract painter in oil and acrylics. But she was 
always struck by how Europeans had borrowed inspiration from ancient Asian 
cultures in silk painting and, over the course of centuries, created an art 
idiom in it. 
</P>
<P>
 In a like spirit, she continues to experiment. Alongside her dangling fish 
here, she's got one mammoth 3-by-5-foot silk panel that is an entire underwater 
scene devised with an alternate technology: using wax to create the images of 
fish, jellyfish, coral, rocks. The depictions are even clearer than on the 
banners, and the multiple subjects within a single scene create a greater sense 
of depth. Where she'll go from here is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the banners, off in a corner of the museum, three visitors sit in 
white plastic patio chairs and watch a video of the famous marine painter John 
Stobart, a Brit living in Massachusetts. Stobart is discussing how he creates 
wharf paintings that transcend being merely correct renderings of docks and 
ships in historical detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a feeling for the scene," he says, attempting to look over a Greenwich, 
Conn., inlet that is sliced through by a roaring Connecticut Turnpike. "The 
space, the play of the light, the sense of drama that nature creates is what 
helps me bring the subject to life." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything in a maritime museum can meet such lofty standards. But much in 
this place does, and helping it rise to such heights is the counterpoint 
achieved by having something as ephemeral and inexact as a temporary silk art 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as it was with so many of the sloops and cutters and ketches and yawls 
and barkentines on display, it's all about discovery.

EARTHWATCH: INSURANCE FIRMS MAY JOIN POLLUTION FIGHT; THE INDUSTRY FEARS 
POTENTIAL CATASTROPHES, SUCH AS FLOODS, BROUGHT ON BY SMOG-INDUCED CHANGES IN 
THE CLIMATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before Christmas, Earthwatch reported that the ocean off our coast commences a 
process of "upwelling" water from its deepest reaches to take on oxygen before 
flowing back around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Over eons, this process has left sediment on the sea bottom that is now being 
studied as a long-term record of the planet's health. 
</P>
<P>
 The new data suggests that global climate can frequently "turn on a button," 
changed by little things -- even human activity -- according to Dr. James 
Kennett, leader of the UC Santa Barbara Marine Science Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more to the story than last week's column could cover. Here's the 
rest: 
</P>
<P>
 In about 90 days, the sun and the sea are soon going to be linked in a big 
environmental story because of the global-warming issue. Historic climate and 
weather changes, recorded in the sea bottom, along with recent episodes of 
severe air pollution trapping the sun's light, may be impacting a major world 
industry: insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, the United Nations is convening a major powwow on climate change, 
with large delegations expected from both the fossil fuel and insurance 
industries. The only tribe as powerful as the coal and oil interests, insurers 
are weighing the possibility that recent weather catastrophes are the first 
real results of human-induced climate change. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that the worst is yet to come, they see their interests conflicting 
directly with those of the fossil fuel industry in the controversy over carbon 
emissions, that cause smog. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the Reinsurance Assn. of America, Franklin Nutter, said 
recently, "The insurance business is first in line to be affected by climate 
change . . . it could bankrupt the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Last time something like this happened, the issue was shoddy, dangerous 
building practices. So the insurance companies fought for strict building 
codes. They might have to stand up for strict pollution standards this time. 
This month they convened a National Hazards Group. We will see its handiwork in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, while the titans square off, ordinary California homeowners are 
already finding notifications of flood-insurance rate hikes in their mail. In 
some cases, mercifully not yet in our county, it's a 50% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 In south Los Angeles County, along the Los Angeles and San Gabriel rivers, 
whole towns are having rates increased and the locals are fighting it because 
it's affecting real estate values. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance actuaries are recalculating risk factors that had been stable for 
decades. This has also triggered new, complex federal requirements that flood 
insurance be obtained prior to mortgage transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchases and sales are being impeded. It's like a reverse neutron bomb -- an 
environmental problem that, regardless of whether it might harm people's 
health, is affecting their property. This sort of thing could spawn legions of 
anti-smog activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite easy to change the climate. A volcanic eruption, a lot of rain 
altering oceanic salinity, increased carbon emissions," explained UCSB's 
Kennett. So far, according to his latest calculations, the planet's climate has 
"flickered," as he termed it, 21 times over the eons, going from hot to cold, 
from ice to typhoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the most recent flood has been recorded by eyewitnesses: Both the ancient 
Hebrews and the Chumash put out news releases 11,000 years ago. You know the 
one preserved in Genesis 7, 8 and 9, but perhaps not the one attributed to the 
19th-Century tribal chronicler, Maria Solares. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the unveiling of data such as Kennett's, and the arrival of the 
insurance industry in the middle of these environmental goings on, Solares' 
version no longer seems merely quaint. Now, it evokes a sensibility more and 
more people share as we all enter the 25th Earth Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what the Chumash chronicler says: "Spotted Woodpecker, Sun's nephew, 
was the only one saved in the flood. We don't know why the flood came or how it 
started, but it kept raining and the water kept rising higher and higher until 
even the mountains were covered. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the people drowned except Woodpecker, who found refuge on top of the 
tallest tree in the world. The water kept rising until it touched his feet. He 
cried out to Sun, 'Help me, Uncle! I am drowning! Save me!' Sun held his torch 
down low and the water began to go down again." 
</P>
<P>
 That was when the world was smogless -- and all power was solar. There now 
seems to be hope this can happen again. Happy New Year.

JAUNTS; 11 SAILS AND 4,200 FEET OF CANVAS: TALL ORDER FOR 1790S-STYLE VESSEL; 
THE REPLICA HAWAIIAN CHIEFTAIN, DOCKING FRIDAY AT VENTURA HARBOR, WILL OFFER 
TOURS AND CRUISES THROUGH JAN. 8. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you want to get a feel for the rigors of sailing in the late 18th Century, 
stop by Ventura Harbor and step aboard the tall ship Hawaiian Chieftain. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship, a square-rigged topsail ketch, arrives Friday and will be dockside 
at Ventura Harbor Village for tours and cruises through Jan. 8. It won't be 
hard to spot. Built in the style of a 1790s-style trading vessel, it has 11 
sails made from 4,200 square feet of canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship is scheduled to dock at noon Friday. Then, from 2 to 5 p.m., visitors 
can tour it for free. The crew will be on hand to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to see what the ship is like under sail, 2 1/2-hour cruises are 
scheduled Saturday, Sunday, Monday and the following weekend at 10:30 a.m. and 
2:30 p.m. The cost is $30 or $35 for adults and $20 for children, and includes 
lunch or hors d'oeuvres. 
</P>
<P>
 On days the ship is not sailing, it will be open for free tours from 10 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. Then, on sailing days, it's open between cruises. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not a lot of ships like this around these days," Capt. Ian McIntyre 
said. "A lot of people are fascinated by square-rigged sails." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawaiian Chieftain represents the great era of sailing ships at the 
beginning of the 19th Century, a time when American and European trading 
vessels were venturing to waters all over the world. At the time, the tall 
ships were considered the most sophisticated transportation ever designed. 
</P>
<P>
 While on board, visitors can check out the more than 90 lines that operate the 
sails. For the crew of six, it's all sweaty manual labor -- nothing is 
automated. All the lines must be heaved through block and tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can peruse the teak woodwork on the deck, rails, hatch, doors and 
skylights. The interior is finished in mahogany paneling. It sleeps up to 20 
crew and passengers in three areas and is licensed to carry 47 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawaiian Chieftain was originally built by a Northern California man for 
$1.2 million, according to McIntyre. The 103-foot-long vessel, built in three 
years on the island of Maui, was launched in 1988. It was intended to run cargo 
and passengers between the islands, but the venture didn't pan out, and 
McIntyre and his partners bought the Hawaiian Chieftain three years ago.

SHOPTALK; MEN WHO DISLIKE SHOPPING FIND A HOME AT THESE STORES; TRADER JOE'S 
WIDE SELECTION OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC BEERS, ALONG WITH 'GUY'-STYLE GOURMET 
FOODS, PROVE A STRONG LURE. 
</P>

<P>
 Every family has its own unique holiday traditions. The Shoptalk Family is no 
different. Mrs. Shoptalk does all the shopping, wrapping, decorating and 
cooking. After the holiday, she is still busy, returning, exchanging and, of 
course, shopping at some of the biggest sales of the year. Traditionally, she 
collapses a couple of days before the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 This is when, traditionally, Mr. Shoptalk springs into action. 
(Coincidentally, this is usually about the same time the last turkey sandwich 
has been consumed.) Mr. Shoptalk is not worried. He heads straight for that 
quintessential "guy" grocery store. That manly, macho store of the many sauces, 
dips, chips and beer -- Trader Joe's. 
</P>
<P>
 Trader Joe's is a unique gourmet grocery and liquor store. Unique in its 
selections and low prices and uniquely a magnet for men shoppers. Your husband 
may not have seen the inside of a grocery store since his bachelor days; he may 
refuse even the most desperate pleas for milk or diapers, but he'll have no 
problem shopping at Trader Joe's. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it that a man who steadfastly refuses to shop relishes a trip to Trader 
Joe's? Perhaps their vast selection of discounted beer is one reason. We 
counted 52 varieties of beer, ale and lager. Beer from England, Germany, Japan, 
Mexico and Australia are all big sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 There's plenty of New Year's Eve bubbly here, too, at great prices. Mumm's 
Rose Perrier Joue and Mumm's Cordon Rouge are available for $17.99 There's also 
a huge wine selection. Mondavi and Sterling Vineyards are called the 
"aristocrats" of California wineries. Mondavi's '93 Napa Valley Chardonnay is 
$9.99 and a '91 Cabernet Sauvignon by Mondavi is $11.99. There is lot of wine 
available for less money, too. 
</P>
<P>
 For nondrinkers, there are plenty of sodas, juices and fancy waters available 
at discount. A 12-pack of Hansen's soda is only $2.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Shoptalk needs a strong cup of coffee in the morning these days. Trader 
Joe's has wonderful whole-bean coffees like Viennese roast ($4.91 per pound) 
and French roast ($5.65 per pound). Decaffeinated coffees run somewhat higher 
in price. For a really quick jolt, we prefer the chocolate-covered espresso 
beans ($3.79 for a 12-ounce tub). 
</P>
<P>
 Trader Joe's cheese prices are unbeatable. There is also a great selection of 
dried fruits and nuts. The selection of mustards and hot sauces is probably 
another siren call to Mr. Shoptalk (a.k.a. the Sauce King). 
</P>
<P>
 Trader Joe's manages to keep its prices low by buying directly and in large 
volume. They do very little advertising and they do not have an advertising 
agency. They also eschew borrowing and pay in cash to get better prices for 
their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever reason men love to shop Trader Joe's, we are grateful. Our New 
Year's resolution is to make shopping Trader Joe's a year-round tradition.

FOR THE KIDS; LEST YOUNG ACQUAINTANCES BE FORGOT, IT'S ALSO PARTY TIME; OXNARD

 New Year's Eve used to be strictly an adult thing, but not so anymore in some 
parts of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, younger children will be partying all night during a sleep-over. 
Activities include crafts, games and videos. There will be party favors to 
welcome the new year in rowdy style. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, high school students can also party hearty in nonalcoholic 
fashion at the Teen Center, where they'll find an assortment of fun stuff, 
including a Las Vegas-style casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers say these events let the kids share New Year's Eve merriment in a 
safe setting, and the sleep-overs give parents a worry-free night without the 
hassle of baby-sitters or kids left home alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard bills its traditional all-nighter as a slumber party for kids 6 to 11, 
but no one gets much sleep. The kids arrive at the Oxnard Community Center at 7 
p.m. with sleeping bags, pillows, toothbrushes, stuffed animals and anything 
else they need for a night away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 They play games, do art projects, snack on pizza and watch videos until 
midnight when they make as much noise as possible. If they want, they can stay 
up all night. It's all over after breakfast at 9 a.m on New Year's Day when 
their parents pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we had 20 or 25 kids," said Paul Ronan, recreation coordinator. 
"It makes the kids feel like they are going to their own party." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost per child is $25. Pre-registration is required. Call no later than 
today to reserve a spot. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Thousand Oaks Teen Center, teen-agers won't be spending the night. 
Their party runs from 9 p.m. until 12:30 a.m. It costs $6 per person -- cheap 
considering what they'll be getting, thanks to $4,300 in donations from the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobby will be transformed into a casino with a crap table, roulette wheel, 
blackjack tables and dealers dressed in tuxedos. Kids play with chips and trade 
them for prizes donated by businesses and people in the community. In another 
part of the center, a coffeehouse will be set up so kids can sip espresso while 
listening to poetry and gentle music. If all that is too low-key, they can 
dance to music played by deejays, who also will hold a lip-syncing contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, they can help themselves to free refreshments and food. Throughout 
the night, there will be drawings for prizes donated by merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before midnight, the countdown will begin. At midnight, hundreds of 
balloons will drop from the ceiling in the gym. Confetti will fill the air, 
along with the blare of noisemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, the bash has drawn several hundred teens, and this year the 
number will be limited to 300. They aren't kidding when they say it's just for 
high school kids: Identification will be checked. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * TEENS: For high school students, the Thousand Oaks Teen Center, 1375 E. 
Janss Road, has a bash from 9 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Cost is $6. For information, 
call 494-5156. 
</P>
<P>
 * ALSO: The city of Oxnard is offering a sleep-over for children 6 to 11 years 
at the Oxnard Community Center, 800 Hobson Way, from 7 p.m. on New Year's Eve 
to 9 a.m. Cost is $25. For reservations and information, call 385-7995.

FASHION; CLIMATE MAY BE RIGHT FOR A REVIVAL OF HEMP; ECOLOGICAL CONCERNS ARE 
MAKING THE TOUGH OLD WEED MORE ATTRACTIVE. DESIGNERS ARE USING BLENDS TO CREATE 
UNIQUE CLOTHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 What plant produces fiber more durable than silk, stronger than linen, softer 
and more environment-friendly than cotton, and can't be grown in the United 
States? 
</P>
<P>
 Hemp. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1930s, the hemp plant, Cannabis sativa , was banned under its 
street name, marijuana, in the United States and all over the world. Today, a 
few countries, notably China and Hungary, have begun growing the plant for its 
long-lasting fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 The fashion world is beginning to discover hemp -- which grows without 
pesticides -- and, from all accounts, wearing it will soon be more politically 
correct than Save the Whale T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 The fabric is not what you'd call new. For most of civilized time, it was the 
leading agricultural crop on the planet. Marco Polo traded it. The canvas sails 
that carried ships around the world were made from it. It supplied paper for 
much of the world's printing and was used for a draft of the Declaration of 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemp was the people's fabric of choice for clothing until Eli Whitney's cotton 
gin made cotton processing cheap. Hemp, whose fiber comes unwillingly from its 
stalk, diminished in use during the Industrial Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last six decades, the federal government has declared all varieties of 
hemp to be dangerous, never mind that industrial hemp wouldn't get a mouse 
high. But until this decade, wearing hemp would have been as quaint as dressing 
up like Ben Franklin, who was said to have worn the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter ecology. Trees have become too precious for paper; cotton depletes the 
land and takes too many chemicals to produce. So people began looking at hemp 
for alternatives. Some of them, you might say, from behind a sort of haze. 
</P>
<P>
 The first hemp clothing made here from imported fabric sold mostly to 
marijuana fans. It came in headbands, hats and backpacks with labels such as 
Stoned Wear, often with a marijuana leaf emblazoned on the front. 
</P>
<P>
 The market share wasn't huge, but it was hot. A lot of people wanted to wear 
the clothes to make a statement, and didn't care if it was pricey -- which it 
definitely is. Chinese and Eastern European growers control the market, and 
worldwide demand is big. 
</P>
<P>
 But something else is happening. Designers in Europe are using blends of hemp 
with silk or flax and coming up with some unusual clothing. Not just 
underground people are buying it. And, maybe, the climate might be ripe for it 
in America. 
</P>
<P>
 One designer who thinks so is Lisa Sauvageau. 
</P>
<P>
 At Studio Sauvageau in Ojai, a workshop, showroom and retail store, the owner 
is working on a wardrobe in a hemp-cotton blend that she will introduce in New 
York next month. Soon after, the collection will be available at the studio and 
in shops such as Georgia Boutell's in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 No hippie would wear these clothes. They are styled for those who might be 
called "the discriminating." 
</P>
<P>
 The most elegant piece is a full-length coat of undyed fabric, with richly 
colored tapestry lapels and cuffs -- a garment for day or night. There are also 
short jackets, hats and bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Sauvageau, who currently designs mostly in tapestry and velvet, finds hemp 
exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to use hemp just because it's hemp," she said. "I chose it 
because of the texture. It's right for what I do. It has a very linen-like 
finish, and the speckles are very beautiful. " 
</P>
<P>
 She expects the styles to endure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a fashion designer; I am just a designer," she said. "I try to 
create things that are not seasonally driven." 
</P>
<P>
 That hemp is linked to an illegal substance is not a drawback, the designer 
said. Because of its attractiveness and environmental correctness, it will 
overcome these associations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The high price of fabric is not a big factor in Sauvageau's collection. Her 
market is near high-end, so she can absorb the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 And possibly, increased competition will bring the price down to put hemp on 
the mass market. England and Canada are beginning to grow hemp, and plan to 
expand their crops. Kentucky is taking a look at hemp. A California company was 
growing hemp under a federal permit earlier this year, but the state ripped out 
the crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe a plant that became popular for the wrong reasons can yet redeem itself. 
It may not, as some claim, save the planet. (Wasn't seaweed going to do that 
too?) But it could do a bit for the American economy, spare a few trees and 
help cut down pesticides on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 All said, it's not too bad a record for a weed.

</P>
<P>
 Vocalist Dorothy McPherson will perform songs from "Porgy and Bess," "The 
Merry Widow," "La Traviata" and "State Fair." 
</P>
<P>
 And, so as not to drift too far from tradition, the concert will conclude with 
a balloon drop to the strains of "Auld Lang Syne." 
</P>
<P>
 The concert will run from 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Tickets are $15-$35. Call 
963-4408. The Arlington is located at 1317 State St.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; COUPLE COOKS CLASSY CUISINE IN MONTECITO; TOP-NOTCH DINING 
LURES LOTS OF PATRONS TO THE WHITE-LINEN CAFE, WHICH MEANS THAT GETTING A TABLE 
CAN TAKE SOME TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mark and Margaret Houston met at chefs' school in San Francisco, got married 
and ventured out into the cruel but exciting world of restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 They worked here and there. They were both in the kitchen at Montecito's San 
Ysidro Ranch for a while. Then Mark became the chef at small, fashionable 
Brigitte's on State Street in Santa Barbara, and Margaret was involved with the 
front of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 About eight years ago, they figured they'd try it on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's not much of a secret that the mortality rate of new restaurants is 
one of the highest of all small businesses in the country. It's not cheap to 
open a good restaurant, and the odds against making it are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Houstons' Montecito Cafe, on Coast Village Road, is thriving. Not many 
white-linen restaurants can fill up a room four times a night, as this place 
sometimes does. It's a tribute to the cafe's consistently good, and frequently 
excellent, food. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, to get to the food, especially on weekends, you've got to deal 
with the restaurant's maddening reservation policy: They only reserve about 
one-third of the 22 tables, and those are usually gone a week or so in advance. 
The rest of us, even arriving as early as, say, 6:30 in the evening, have to 
wait often for as long as an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 It must work, because there we were, hanging around in the lobby of the 
Montecito Inn, where the cafe's tables front large windows looking out onto the 
boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, locals -- though generally enthusiastic -- did have a couple of 
small problems with the operation. The noise level, for one, was high. 
Recently, some renovation out front eliminated some of the problem. Still, we 
were left longing for fewer decibels in the room closest to the kitchen and in 
the small, intimate wine bar at the rear. 
</P>
<P>
 The other problem was in the portions, which -- even in those days, when the 
word nouvelle was synonymous with small -- were none too hefty. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, either my appetite has diminished or portions have increased, but in 
recent months I've never found myself leaving hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu does seem to take a minimalist approach: lots of salads -- albeit 
large, sometimes complicated ones -- and a grouping of contemporary pastas. 
This is not, at first glance, a place for red-meat lovers. Yet, if you look 
carefully and pay attention to the evening specials, meat eaters should go away 
satisfied. In fact, Mark Houston is at his best with red meat and possibly 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The grilled leg of lamb ($9.25), medium red, sliced and juicy, is one of the 
best you'll find anyplace. It's done with rosemary and roasted garlic, with the 
sauce coming from the lamb stock. It is absolutely superb, as is the lamb loin 
($14.95), occasionally a special, in any one of a variety of sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 Another succulent occasional special is the thick veal steak ($17.95), also 
served in a number of different sauces. I enjoyed a light cream sauce of 
chanterelle mushrooms -- perfectly done. 
</P>
<P>
 The grilled pork chops ($11.95), however, would not be my meat of choice. They 
are served with a lightly flavored curry sauce and an excellent apple chutney 
on the side, neither of which redeems the pork. It is dry -- an occupational 
hazard for those restaurants serving thin pork chops. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on salads means that some of them are actually main dishes. One 
of these stars is romaine ($6.95) tossed with Gorgonzola cheese, bacon, 
chicken, avocado and tomato. Is that rich enough? They also serve a cold -- 
some might say too cold -- variety of crisp vegetables ($6.95), with a small 
piece of cold salmon beautifully prepared, moist and juicy. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastas, notwithstanding the tantalizing descriptions -- "capellini with rock 
shrimp, pesto, grilled peppers and virgin olive oil" -- are not the most 
exciting choices on the menu. There is much too much virgin olive oil in the 
capellini ($7.95), and the spinach fettuccine ($8.50) with scallops, dried 
tomatoes and pine nuts in a cream sauce turns out to be just another dish. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be difficult to improve on the fish dishes. One night, on the list of 
specials, there was a lovely grilled swordfish ($12.50) served in lemon, garlic 
and cilantro. Another evening there was a piece of broiled whitefish in a 
butter sauce with green peppercorns ($9.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Appetizers seem to run the gamut. The dullest item on the entire menu is the 
grilled pasilla chile ($4.50), with Emmentaler cheese and a tomato vinaigrette. 
The cheese is the only one of the three ingredients with any zest, character or 
flavor. The chopped romaine heart salad ($3.75) is excellent, with garlic 
vinaigrette, croutons and Parmesan cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the best of the appetizers are the goat cheese pancakes ($4.95), with 
salmon gravlax and tiny dabs of caviar. Flavors merge from the pancakes and the 
hefty, not too oily gravlax. 
</P>
<P>
 Montecito Cafe is not the place to pass on dessert. Although some of us are 
die-hard fans of heavy New York-style cheesecake, the lighter version served 
here ($4) is one of the best I've ever eaten. Details

 Indescribable. That's the word for the decor of Two West Coffee Co., a 
family-run coffee house scheduled to open Tuesday in Ventura (at 2 W. Main St.) 
</P>
<P>
 From the outside, the establishment looks intriguing enough -- it's in a 
91-year-old brick building. On the inside, there's more than the eye can take 
in at one glance. "A friend of mine (Justin Bailey) is a set designer in L.A. I 
gave him complete creative license," said co-owner Dave Paglia. "He went 
absolutely berserk. It looks like something out of Roger Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
 One side of the place is set up in bizarre living-room fashion for lounging, 
chatting, thinking and playing pool, with a wall set aside for rotating art 
exhibits. The other side has the coffee bar, food, more seating and a stage for 
music, poetry readings and maybe even avant-garde performance art. Much of the 
furniture and a portion of the artwork (especially on the "Wall of Shame") was 
collected from garage sales, thrift stores and even a trash can or two, said 
Paglia. The circus scene above the coffee bar, and paintings of the poodle boy 
and gorilla girl, help set the mood. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the edibles, Two West will be open for breakfast from 6:30 a.m., with 
muffins, scones and baguettes prepared by Santa Barbara baker Per. For lunch, 
the menu will include sandwiches, pasta salads and soups. Dinner for now is 
frozen pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the coffee, expect to find about six blends available daily. "People 
say, 'Oh, another coffee house.' But it isn't just another coffee house," said 
Paglia. "It's not like you're even in Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the past couple of weeks, we've been letting you know of some of the 
New Year's feasts planned for Ventura County. In case you're still looking for 
just the right one, here's another option. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Gael Lecolley of Wheeler Hot Springs, in Ojai, will be cooking up a 
shindig of his own. The menu begins with a salad with vegetable garnish and a 
truffle sherry vinaigrette, followed by an appetizer choice of Scottish smoked 
salmon with mascarpone cheese, fresh chives and orange comfit; or the forest 
mushroom polenta , with porcini, shitake and chanterelle mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 After a cleansing lime sorbet comes the entree -- a choice of three medallions 
of beef with foie gras , celery-root puree and a morel sauce; filet of sturgeon 
served in an herb crust with lobster bisque sauce and caviar; or a grilled rack 
of lamb with an apple-brandy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost is $85 per person, which includes entertainment by the Chris Cain Band.

SCOTT HARRIS: TABLOID TRASH HAS POTENTIAL AS CULTURAL ASSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a blue Christmas at Los Angeles City Hall. Here we are, a world-class 
city with world-class problems -- riots, earthquakes, crack, the Clippers. And 
when Washington sought bids for the biggest urban renewal program in decades -- 
a program inspired by the L.A. riots of '92 -- City Hall figured we had it in 
the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said that as long as our name was on a paper," Councilman Mike Hernandez 
recalled, "we'd get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, L.A. was just too confident about its miseries. Just before Christmas, 
Los Angeles lost the grand prize, a program worth $1.5 billion to $3 billion 
over five years. A Times investigation largely confirmed this unsigned critique 
found in city files: "Plan has no focus. . . . There is still no real 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, this reporter has obtained a confidential memo, familiarly addressed 
to Mayor Richard Riordan, that contains provocative ideas that weren't included 
in the city's final bid proposal. Was the city too timid? You be the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 To: Dick 
</P>
<P>
 From: B. 
</P>
<P>
 Re: Vision 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for inviting me and my staff to contribute ideas for spending the 
federal monies destined to come our way due to your brilliant hands-on 
leadership. Here's a few that struck us as especially promising: 
</P>
<P>
 Tabloid Cultural Square -- Intense public interest in the trials of O.J. 
Simpson, the Menendez brothers and Heidi Fleiss has revealed the inadequacy of 
existing facilities. Los Angeles should not be ashamed of its star-making 
machinery; indeed, we have perfected the art. We should honor our city's 
pioneering role in the blurring of news and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 We envision Tabloid Cultural Square as a public-private partnership that will 
merge the courts and show biz. L.A., after all, is assured of a steady supply 
of celebrity cases, both criminal and civil, lurid crimes and colorful lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the criminal justice system is a burden on taxpayers, but only because 
seating is limited and free. By providing large "court arenas"' and selling 
tickets -- indeed, why not luxury boxes? -- TCS would help crime pay for 
itself. We're talking win-win here. Boring civil trials could be resolved in a 
game show format, perhaps with verdicts decided by an applause-o-meter, or with 
Judge Wapner shouting, "Survey says!" 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Broadway draws tourists to New York, TCS will do the same for Los 
Angeles. Plus, L.A. could build the architectural monument it lacks. Frank 
Gehry might make a odd-looking symphony hall, but just imagine if he brought 
his populist sensibilities to TCS! (Something yellow, we trust, with an 
electronic news ticker blaring the latest headlines.) Or maybe we could let 
Oliver Stone give architecture a try. (Just a thought.) 
</P>
<P>
 Mutually Assured Peace 'n' Profit -- Gun control efforts have been an utter 
failure. It's time for L.A. to embrace its Wild West roots and instead adopt 
the policy advocated by many gun enthusiasts: the encouragement of gun 
possession -- by all people at all times. Just as the policy of "mutually 
assured destruction" prevented Armageddon during the Cold War, the specter of a 
public bristling with firepower should help us all sleep easier -- and create 
jobs! 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, trends start in Los Angeles; before long all of America will follow 
our lead. With tax breaks and seed money, we can lure more weapons 
manufacturers to our fair city, and thus become a leading exporter, always 
creating more and trendier weaponry. Ad agencies can be awarded grants to 
produce campaigns promoting weaponry as a fashion accessory ("the Uzi look"). 
</P>
<P>
 The National Rifle Assn., of course, should be a great ally. Education and 
safety programs could be tailored to specific needs. A class in drive-by 
marksmanship for gang members, for example, may decrease the amount of 
collateral damage among people who naively shun self-protection options. 
(Sentimental phrases such as "innocent bystanders" should be discouraged; 
instead, we must stress the personal responsibility and higher social purpose 
of assault rifles, armor-piercing ammunition, rocket launchers, flame-throwers, 
et al.) 
</P>
<P>
 Our Own "Chunnel" -- Ridership figures raise questions about whether Metro 
Rail is worth the billions spent on this project. Still, Metro Rail is a proven 
source of campaign contributions, not to mention jobs for construction workers, 
engineers and bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 With all that whining from Hollywood merchants about sinking streets, and from 
Valleyites about the best rail route on their turf, perhaps we should avoid 
densely populated areas and extend the rail line west from Long Beach to Avalon 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 And so on. Too bad we're out of space. It's understandable why officials might 
hesitate about some of these plans. But why they passed on Tabloid Cultural 
Square is beyond me.

MEXICO'S IMMIGRANT LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Fineman's Dec. 19 story on harsh Mexican immigration laws underscores the 
hypocrisy of President Ernesto Zedillo's criticism of the California electorate 
and their overwhelming support for Proposition 187. It's about time we realize 
that Mexico's best interests are not the same as ours. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as we allow foreign governments to dictate our policies regarding 
immigration, we will always have to justify our strict enforcement regarding 
illegal entry into the United States. It seems that every time we crack down at 
the border, Mexico ends up threatening some retaliatory action. 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying question is whether Washington has the resolve to not only stop 
illegal entries but to enforce the laws enacted in the Immigration Reform and 
Control Act that provide sanctions against employers who hire illegal aliens. 
We paid the price for enforcement when we allowed millions of illegals to 
obtain legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 has started on the way to an eventual review by the Supreme 
Court. It will be decided one way or the other, but we must stem the flow 
through a continuing crackdown at the border. The double standard of the 
Mexican government in the area of illegal immigration only exacerbates the 
problem. 
</P>

 * The Times carried a front-page article on the immigration pressures facing 
Mexico on its southern border. Inside, an article dealt with the scarcity of 
water for agriculture in California. No mention was made in either about the 
underlying problem of overpopulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless world leaders and the press vigorously address overpopulation and the 
urgent need for responsible family planning, there are no solutions to the 
above problems and many others like them.

<P>
 * At last, The Times has briefly stopped bashing the electorate majority for 
passing Proposition 187, by publishing a report on Mexico's harsh treatment of 
its own illegal immigrants. You wrote that, "In Mexico, the immigration issue 
remains so sensitive that no government officials would speak on the record 
about it" and "all statistics on deportations and detentions . . . are off 
limits to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, evidently not sensitive enough to zip the lips of President Zedillo who, 
at the recent Miami Summit of the Americas, condemned Proposition 187 as "a 
violation of Mexican human rights." Mexico further attempts to dilute its 
culpability by suggesting that most illegals are merely crossing Mexico on 
their way to the U.S. border.

CAPITALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Pinkerton's essay, "Capitalism's Moral Center Is Freedom" (Column Right, 
Dec. 16), prompts two responses. First, he misrepresents Max Weber's 
argument.Weber never argued, as Pinkerton asserts, that there is something 
"particularly 'Protestant' about capitalism." Weber was concerned with fleshing 
out the combination of factors that led to the emergence of modern rational 
capitalism. The central question was why capitalism emerged at this specific 
historical juncture. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, he is correct to argue that free markets do not mean political 
freedom. But it is a fallacy to suggest capitalism ought to be (or was) 
governed by some moral order. Much to his disbelief, capitalism is a 
competitive Darwinian struggle to survive. By its very nature, capitalism 
cannot foster human welfare or political freedom or human rights; it is a 
highly dynamic system that will lead to innovation through the competitive 
struggle to make a profit. To suggest that capitalism ought to do otherwise is 
at the very least to desire another form of social organization. For as Weber 
did argue, "In a wholly capitalistic order of society, an individual 
capitalistic enterprise that did not take advantage of its opportunity for 
profit-making would be doomed to extinction."

 I am entirely satisfied with the U.S. Postal Service. I find the employees

 * It appears that we citizens are again victims of a Catch-22. Postal rates 
are rising again! This in the face of highly increased e-mail and fax usage. 
Although postal services will always be required, these technological tools 
should help reduce the physical load on the Postal Service. In addition, 
aggressive marketing by private carriers have reduced the small-package 
handling requirements at the Postal Service. Still there has been no effort 
made to reduce personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 We all have experienced similar situations before. During the energy crisis, 
we were asked to reduce the use of electricity. We did and were rewarded with 
increased rates because the power companies debt obligations remained the same. 
Likewise, with the drought. We reduced water consumption and the rates were 
again increased for the same reason.

 We must add to the vocabulary of these agencies: downsize.

SHOOTING NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re the shooting of Marcelino Corniel in front of the White House, Dec. 21: 
</P>
<P>
 If a bear or mountain lion is endangering the public, an animal control 
professional will first try to sedate the animal. If this does not work, they 
shoot to kill.  
</P>
<P>
 In a truly compassionate and civilized society, authorities must give humans 
this and even greater consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of the White House, Corniel with a knife taped to his hand, 
confronted six or more police officers armed with guns. Common sense tells us 
this man is not in a rational frame of mind. Electronic stunning weapons, 
clubs, a net, a sedative or percussion gun that shoots rubber bullets could 
have been used. 
</P>
<P>
 This would have saved the taxpayers many thousands of dollars since he had to 
be operated on for two separate wounds.  
</P>
<P>
 The blame is not on the officer who fired the gun; he was following procedure. 
A similar situation happened in Los Angeles recently by a man disturbed over a 
family matter. He was shot while he walked toward the police with a knife. It 
is barbarism not to try to incapacitate the individual with the correct level 
of force, especially while outnumbering the assailant and having a good 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 MAURICE L. MIELE 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * American officials say North Korea should not have shot our helicopter -- it 
was mistakenly off-course and did not present an immediate threat. Yet American 
officials shot Corniel at the White House for not dropping a knife although 
they had him outnumbered. He was shot for not obeying instructions to "freeze." 
</P>
<P>
 We do not seem to know what we believe. We protest when we're hurt, but we are 
silent when we hurt others. It is time to discover our principles and apply 
them evenly. Police should be given non-lethal weapons like stun guns and 
rubber bullets and use superior numbers and patience to subdue off-course 
civilians without killing them. It is not too much to think the police should 
go for a blanket or net with which to subdue a deranged man with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 I. P. RODMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
 * Again, it seems that police officers can do nothing right. Rather, the 
criminal who threatens the safety of society and that of the officers called on 
to protect society is excused. Such is the ridiculous case of Corniel, whose 
family is now filing an absurd excessive-force lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 While The Times rightly notes the concern of police officers with regard to 
"Monday morning quarterbacking" (editorial, Dec. 23), you also engage in that 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Be it a broken crutch, a knife, a baseball bat or even a broken bottleneck, 
they are all lethal weapons when used in anger. How many police officers lie 
buried because they waited too long before taking action? After five years in 
police work and having seen my share of makeshift weapons and the victims of 
same, I say let's back up the guys behind the badge now and then.

 Re " . . . And Constitutional Rights Lag Behind," Commentary, Dec. 19: 
</P>
<P>
 I, too, am greatly concerned over government's pernicious encroachment on our 
right to privacy. Bart Kosko's comments regarding the FBI's difficulty in 
establishing wiretaps in a few cases are accurate.However, with the advent of a 
digital telephone system throughout the U.S., the FBI has also seen and seized 
a great opportunity -- the implementation of a capability to conduct 
wiretaps/electronic eavesdropping from the comfort of its own offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The great problem we will all have is when the government finally says that we 
can no longer use our own systems, only those which they can read. We were 
asleep at the wheel when we allowed the FBI's anti-privacy bill to pass. I 
shudder to think what our next lapse in attention may bring.

 * Kosko's essay hit an important note. We are now in the Information Age. 
Information and analytical ability are the new commodities of choice. What we

era. 
</P>
<P>
 America (and the world) needs to update its laws and ideas. Ideas are not just 
conveyed through the written word or told down at the old tavern. Nor are they 
just methods of convincing people. They are the marketable commodity. Today we 
talk on bulletin boards and over cellular phones. Legislation needs to be 
updated. Legislation designed for a printing-press era and an industrial 
economy needs to be updated for the post-Cold War information era.

OPPORTUNITY AMID FISCAL CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local governments strapped for cash have increasingly considered selling 
property or letting private firms operate facilities such as jails and 
hospitals if it would save money. A favorite target has been government-run 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles looked at selling or leasing its international airport but has 
settled so far for raising landing fees. Orange County, stunned by bankruptcy, 
is now considering putting John Wayne Airport on the block. It is an idea worth 
exploring, but county officials need to have their eyes open to the obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 A key stumbling block is the federal government's reasonable assertion that 
because it financed many improvements at airports, including air traffic 
control towers and runways, it deserves a chunk of the proceeds from any sale. 
So although at least one potential buyer has expressed interest in John Wayne 
Airport, the county would not get all the money. Even when an airport's fees 
are raised, federal law usually requires that the increased revenue be spent on 
operations related to the airport.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County officials said they also will consider selling county property 
that is now leased for parking lots and other uses. That, too, needs to be 
examined. The county's devastating multibillion-dollar loss will mean pain, but 
it also offers a chance to re-examine and reinvent government. That is an 
opportunity that must be seized.

PAIN IN SOUTH-CENTRAL'S HEART: LANGUISHING IN RIOT RECOVERY; LITTLE REBUILDING 
HAS OCCURRED IN THE MOST DEVASTATED AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles' failure this month to win a federal empowerment zone represents 
an acute loss for poor residents, particularly those who live in South-Central 
Los Angeles. The need for jobs and services is urgent in the neighborhoods that 
straddle the Harbor Freeway south of Downtown. An empowerment zone offering tax 
breaks for employers and new social spending could have provided the catalyst 
for a broader recovery from the 1992 riots.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rebuilding has hopscotched over the hardest-hit areas of 
South-Central Los Angeles. The new construction has occurred primarily in 
somewhat more affluent neighborhoods north of the Santa Monica Freeway or west 
of Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil disorder damaged or destroyed 2,314 businesses, 64% of them retail 
operations, across Los Angeles County. In parts of South-Central -- where the 
riot-related damage was the greatest -- major supermarkets, clothing stores and 
some other businesses remain nearly nonexistent. The recent opening of a 
supermarket, a Food 4 Less at 54th and Main streets, was cheered by shoppers 
who had been forced to travel miles to shop. However, Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Rita Walters notes that three full-service grocery stores are far 
from adequate to serve the 260,000 constituents she represents. She is pleased 
that a Vons is planned in her district. She is also working with RLA and 
Concerned Citizens of South-Central to help manufacturing businesses stay in 
the area and grow. That task would have been made much easier by a federal 
empowerment zone designation. 
</P>
<P>
 LONGSTANDING BARRIERS: The obstacles to rebuilding in South-Central -- 
obstacles present even before the 1992 upheaval -- include the lingering 
recession, chronic insurance redlining and a pervasive fear of crime (often 
exaggerated by outsiders). Even when businesses are willing to come in, they 
must overcome physical disadvantages such as parking restrictions imposed by 
old, narrow streets and the unavailability of larger land parcels that 
investors need to turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the riots, many absentee landlords haven't gone back to visit the old 
neighborhood and aren't inclined to rebuild. Some speculators wait for more 
lucrative deals, while property owners who bought at the top of a real estate 
market now gone bust can't afford to rebuild on lots made vacant by the 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 250 lots remain vacant in council districts represented by Walters 
and Mark Ridley-Thomas. In Ridley-Thomas' district, which includes parts of 
South-Central Los Angeles, Leimert Park and the Crenshaw district, the 
councilman brokered a 12-screen theater deal at the Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw 
Mall. He worked to have three new grocery stores -- a Smart & Final, an Alpha 
Beta and a Ranch Market -- put into operation. He also encouraged the 
development of commercial and residential projects in the Manchester 
Avenue-Vermont Avenue area, including a senior citizens housing complex, which 
is scheduled to break ground today. Both Ridley-Thomas and Walters deserve 
credit for aggressively prodding government and businesses to rebuild in South 
Los Angeles. Eleven lots remain vacant in the Pico-Union area, which is 
represented by Mike Hernandez, who also is pressing to improve impoverished 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 $125-MILLION FEDERAL PROMISE: To encourage rebuilding in neglected areas where 
the needs are greatest, RLA President Linda Griego is looking for new 
investment. In the hunt for capital, she is pitching four public pension funds 
to put together a $55-million deal to rejuvenate some of the vacant lots. This 
novel approach came closer to fruition last week when the Clinton 
Administration promised Los Angeles a consolation grant of $125 million in 
economic development initiative funds after the Los Angeles application for the 
coveted federal empowerment zone was rejected. The promised package from the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development will include federal loan 
guarantees that could be used to reduce the risk to pension funds that invest 
in the central city. Without any government impetus, poor neighborhoods stand 
to slide still further. If that happens, the detritus of the riots -- the 
boarded-up stores, burned-out gas stations and weed-filled vacant lots -- will 
become a permanent legacy of the worst urban strife in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 If Los Angeles is to prosper, no part of the city can be written off. The 
heart of South-Central Los Angeles cannot be allowed to suffer the decline that 
Watts endured after the riots of 1965, a tragedy from which it has never fully 
recovered. Help from Washington, prodding from City Hall, a commitment from 
private investors, an aggressive RLA and other diligent rebuilding efforts are 
needed to broaden the recovery and turn promises into profits.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; MIRACLE WORKERS' COMEUPPANCE; THE PESO WAS OVERDUE FOR 
ADJUSTMENT, BUT THE ZEDILLO TECHNOCRATS' OVERCONFIDENCE TURNED A NUDGE INTO A 
FREE FALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

College.

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Mexican peso plummeted over the past week, U.S. activists who had 
opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement alternated between crying 
"foul" and boasting "I told you so." Congress, after all, had been sold NAFTA 
based on the allure of rising exports to our southern neighbor; a cheapened 
peso now threatens to slow the U.S. export boom, make Mexican workers even more 
competitive and further threaten American wages and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not just the United States suffering from peso shock. A key element 
in maintaining support for NAFTA in Mexico was the connection of trade 
liberalization to the peso's stability. The reason was straightforward: The 
Mexican inflation-fighting "miracle" of the past six years was based on the 
coupling of unilateral reductions in trade barriers with a relatively fixed 
currency, which insured that imports could act as a sort of ceiling on domestic 
price hikes. The results were nothing short of spectacular: a decline in 
inflation from nearly 160% in 1987 to less than 10% this year. Many small and 
medium-size Mexican industrialists who felt battered by the increased 
international competition nonetheless welcomed the return to macroeconomic 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Devaluation, however, was always a real possibility. Between 1987 and 1993, 
exports grew by around 50% while imports quadrupled. Trade and current account 
deficits skyrocketed to levels not seen since before the 1982 debt crisis, and 
the peso was more overvalued than it had been in 1981. The government's 
technocrats dismissed worries about the peso's sustainability, arguing that the 
demand for Mexican currency was driven by investors eager to crowd into the 
newly stable economy. But the vast bulk of "investment" involved the return of 
flight capital and purchases in the Mexican stock market, and the sudden 
collapse in the dollar value of these assets is likely to chase many skittish 
investors right back out. 
</P>
<P>
 This complicates a Mexican political scene already staggered by the effects of 
the renewed fighting in Chiapas. The almost 40% decline in the peso will soon 
translate into higher prices, and the clamor for compensating wages will feed 
the inflationary spiral. Exorbitant interest rates, jacked upward to reflect 
the new currency risk, will stifle domestic investors' plans. As the economy 
slows and the government is forced to tighten its purse-strings, the promises 
of the last electoral season -- that in 1995, economic prosperity would finally 
trickle down to the poor -- are likely to be broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did newly inaugurated President Ernesto Zedillo chose a course seemingly 
designed to alienate the wealthy, frustrate the poor and reduce the purchasing 
power of Mexico's growing middle class? He decided to loosen the government's 
reins on the sorely overvalued peso, hoping for a soft landing, a nudge 
downward that could be blamed squarely on the Zapatista rebellion. But when the 
peso went into a free fall, investors felt betrayed by the government, not 
Subcomandante Marcos, and their run toward the dollar pushed the peso to 
unexpected lows. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo's miscalculation was partly rooted in the excessive confidence of the 
technocrats: Having managed both an end to inflation and a history-defying 
free-trade pact with the United States, they valued textbook economic theory 
over political wisdom. The miscalculation also reflects the new president's 
attempt to both embrace and break free of the legacy of his mentor, former 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari: Zedillo wanted to begin his administration 
with a bold charge in a new direction, just as Salinas did in 1988; unlike 
Salinas, Zedillo chose a policy destined to weaken his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The political fallout is just beginning. One poll last week reported that 89% 
of the public sees little or no hope of economic improvement in the coming 
year. The head of Mexico's major business federation has called on Zedillo to 
develop a new economic plan, signaling the erosion of support for a government 
that Salinas taught business to love. 
</P>
<P>
 What should the United States do? The Clinton Administration has reactivated a 
$6-billion credit line, which gives the Mexican government additional monies to 
support the peso. There is little else to do now but wait -- and begin to worry 
about other Latin American reformers, such as Argentina and Peru, that have 
taken a similar policy tack with regard to unilateral trade liberalization, 
overvalued currency and the pursuit of free-trade pacts with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 As the second act of the Mexican "miracle" unfolds, its missteps of recent 
weeks are warnings for Latin America's future.

CLOSE THE FINAL CHAPTER; VIETNAM WAR: THE FAMILIES OF OUR MIAS HAVE TO ACCEPT 
THE SAD TRUTH THAT THEIR LOVED ONES ARE NEVER COMING HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK A. WILSON, Mark A. Wilson is a history teacher and writer living in 
Berkeley. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You see them everywhere in the streets of Hanoi. Armies of ragtag young men, a 
few with missing limbs, hustling to sell souvenirs to visiting American 
journalists and businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, if not most of them, are victims of the Vietnam War's last years, when 
U.S. bombers conducted intensive round-the-clock bombing raids on Hanoi and 
Haiphong. Besides those who lost an arm or a leg, there are many more who lost 
a father or an uncle in combat. And if you take time to talk to them, many will 
tell you in pidgin English that they have a relative "who disappear" during the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese government conservatively estimates there are more than 300,000 
Vietnamese MIAs -- nearly 200 times as many U.S. servicemen still unaccounted 
for from that war. Yet nowhere in Hanoi are signs of hostility toward Americans 
visible today. Indeed, visitors are greeted warmly by the general populace of 
the city, once a hotbed of anti-Americanism. 
</P>
<P>
 I did not serve in the Vietnam War. I was lucky -- my draft lottery number was 
320. But I feel more than the normal amount of sympathy for the families of 
American MIAs. My family is one of thousands that have become part of a 
phenomenon that I call "civilian MIAs." 
</P>
<P>
 My next-youngest brother disappeared 13 years ago. He was, in a very real 
sense, a casualty of Vietnam. He opposed the war so strongly that when ordered 
to appear for a physical before induction in the Army, he quit his job and 
junior college classes and began hitchhiking around the country. We saw him 
only a few times over the next several years as he slipped further into drug 
and alcohol abuse. In 1981, his long-distance collect calls stopped coming, and 
none of us have had any news of him since. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other MIA families, we try to convince ourselves that my brother must 
still be alive out there somewhere, perhaps in a religious commune or in 
prison. Yet deep in our hearts, we sense the awful truth that no one dares to 
utter: My brother probably died alone and afraid in some strange city, and now 
lies buried in an unmarked grave. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one fact that has been ignored in the debate over whether to withhold 
diplomatic recognition of Vietnam over the MIA issue. At the end of World War 
II, there were nearly 4,800 American military personnel listed as missing in 
action. Should we have refused recognition of Germany or Japan after that war 
because thousands of bodies of American servicemen lay unidentified somewhere 
in the fields of Europe, or scattered across the islands of the Pacific? On the 
contrary, in 1946, the U.S. government officially declared all personnel 
missing in action from World War II to be presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an uncomfortable but undeniable fact that slightly more than 1,600 
American MIA families from the Vietnam War are using guilt and political 
intimidation to pressure the government of the most powerful nation on Earth 
into refusing to recognize the existence of the world's 12th most populous 
nation. If the 75 million people of Vietnam have managed to put the pain and 
bitter memories of the war behind them -- a war that took more than 20 times as 
many of their countrymen's lives as it did of ours -- why shouldn't Americans 
be able to do so as well? 
</P>
<P>
 As harsh as it may sound, it's time for our MIAs' families to let go of the 
past and accept the sad truth that their loved ones are never coming home -- 
not even to be buried. While the search for the remains of American MIAs should 
continue on the chance that some of their remains may be discovered over the 
next few years, the U.S. government should be judicious enough to extend 
diplomatic relations to the Republic of Vietnam immediately. Only then can the 
relatives of our missing servicemen, and the nation as a whole, heal the 
deepest wounds of the longest and most painful war in American history.

COLUMN LEFT/ NEAL RICHMAN: IGNORING THE POOR CAT'S MEOW; ENOUGH WITH GIVING 
HANDOUTS TO EVERY FIDO AND FLUFFY WHO STICKS OUT A PAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEAL RICHMAN, Neal Richman lives with his family in West Los Angeles. Over 
the past 40 years, he has cared for one dog, one bird, two cats, a litter of 
kittens and tropical fish too numerous to count. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's another Sunday morning and I'm immersing myself in Column Right. Suddenly 
my reverie breaks at the voice of my wife: "You forgot to feed the cat." Guilt. 
Images sweep over me of an emaciated gray and white feline, barely able to 
raise her head, lying on our doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 Something snaps. My eyes rise from Charles Krauthammer's byline. I feel a new 
spirit, a new defiance surging through my veins: 
</P>
<P>
 "Feeding the cat is not my responsibility at all," I tell my wife. "The 
problem is you and other animal lovers have bred dependency relationships with 
species that have been self-sufficient for millenia." 
</P>
<P>
 Words rush ahead: "We have created generations of pets that now need to get 
off the dole and stand on their own four paws. It's time that they pulled 
themselves up by their own choke chains." 
</P>
<P>
 I continue: "Why, you may ask, do we have a population of pets wholly lacking 
in any individual initiative? I'll tell you why. It is because of soft-hearted 
liberal do-gooders, like you, who have chosen to 'take care' of these 
creatures. What do we get for all these years of indulgence? Pets, totally 
lacking in self-respect, who think that all they have to do for their keep is 
slavishly slobber all over our faces or curl up quietly in our laps. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the costs incurred by our pets greatly exceed those associated with 
victimless crimes like prostitution. Just compare sales of pet food with the 
cost of welfare. And these sales figures do not include necessary ancillary 
services, like flea baths and obedience school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah, but you say, pet expenditure is a private choice paid for by private 
dollars. Not so. We taxpayers are stuck with a significant portion of the bill 
for little frou-frou: Think of our fire departments rescuing kittens in lieu of 
complying with affirmative-action programs. Think of the expensive clean-up of 
Santa Monica Bay as the storm drains continue to spread pet wastes down the 
coastline. Think of the parks and recreation staff, who could be coordinating 
midnight basketball, now reduced to an army of pooper scoopers." 
</P>
<P>
 I add in my most scholarly tone: "Research will certainly demonstrate that the 
public expenses associated with allowing pets to remain in our state is greater 
than what they contribute to the tax rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "And while these free-loaders use both public and private services in the most 
profligate manner, how truly committed are they to the American way? Visit any 
grooming parlor in the state and, I guarantee, not one client will speak 
English." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, images of a major political campaign emerge . . . a statewide 
initiative denying public services to pets? Can this take me to the 
governorship? 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to my wife, I let her know that I refuse to be labeled a "specist" 
because of these views. "Some of my best friends are pets. I heartily support, 
for example, the presence of lawful contributing members of our society, such 
as seeing-eye dogs. It is just the layabouts, the freeloaders that have to now 
earn their keep. There are lots of opportunities if they would just look for 
them. For instance, since the infectious diseases of the 19th Century on the 
rise, we could once again use pet labor in ridding our cities of vermin. It is 
no longer acceptable for so-called pet advocates to claim there are not enough 
jobs out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, of course, how do you turn around the pet population after 
so many generations of dependency? They must regain self-supporting, dignified 
lives; yet this social transformation cannot happen on its own. We must 
consider a wide-scale revival of animal pounds. Yes, they have been portrayed 
by the liberal media as nasty and brutish places, but we must not forget that 
they can also be "homes" providing a corrective function for wayward pets." We 
all know that the pound's "program" can be an important deterrent for unwanted 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 And I add, " . . . especially if we include other species, certain to stand 
below me in the grand pecking order." 
</P>
<P>
 Quiet until this point, my wife raises an eyebrow and simply replies, "Don't 
be so sure."

OBITUARY; VICTOR GOODHILL; EAR SURGEON, MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victor Goodhill, an internationally recognized eye, ear, nose and throat 
surgeon best known as the otologist whose interests ranged from establishing 
clinics for hard-of-hearing children to Ludwig von Beethoven's deafness, has 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for UCLA, where he was a professor emeritus and chairman of the 
board of the school's Hope for Hearing Research Foundation, said Goodhill was 
83 when he died Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Goodhill, who worked with Louise Tracy to establish the John Tracy Clinic 
(named for Spencer and Louise Tracy's deaf son), was also an accomplished 
violinist, intrigued with how musicians, Beethoven in particular, overcame 
their handicaps. For many years he was a regular participant in monthly 
meetings at UCLA in which physicians and lay people studied disabled artists of 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983 Goodhill helped produce "Beethoven: Triumph Over Silence," which has 
been shown throughout the United States. In the film Goodhill demonstrates how 
the 18th-Century German actually could hear some of his music despite a hearing 
loss that began in the composer's 20s and had become severe by the time of his 
death in 1827 at age 57. Goodhill also dismissed a centuries-old report that 
the composer lost his hearing because of syphilis, blaming instead Paget's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodhill, a 1936 graduate of USC Medical School, was involved in some of the 
earliest procedures to correct otosclerosis, a calcium buildup on the bones of 
the stapes, which in the early 1940s was treated by boring through the skull to 
create a sound window. Later he placed sophisticated cochlear implants where 
his crude tools had once been. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no antibiotics for infections when he started to practice and ear 
surgeries often were life threatening, he told The Times in 1985 as another 
unit -- the Victor Goodhill Ear Center -- was preparing to open. 
</P>
<P>
 He was USC School of Medicine alumnus of the year in 1972 and in 1976 received 
the fifth Joseph Toynbee Memorial Lectureship at the Royal College of Surgeons 
in England. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a prolific author as well, publishing the first text on stapes surgery 
in 1960, a text in 1980 entitled "Ear Diseases, Deafness and Dizziness" (now 
being revised) and more than 150 journal articles and 25 chapters in other 
medical books. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was active in the Jewish community, as chairman of the Board of 
Overseers at the University of Judaism, as a member of the Board of Governors 
at Sinai Temple and as a board overseer for the Jewish Theological Seminary in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 And music -- which he studied at the New England Conservatory in Boston -- 
remained a passion. He was concertmaster of the USC Symphony Orchestra and a 
board member of the Music Guild of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But not necessarily all music. 
</P>
<P>
 And especially not loud music. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a certain sickness in wanting to be vibrated by loud noises," he said 
scornfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodhill suffered a minor hearing loss himself in his later years. 
</P>
<P>
 But it did not affect his playing. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that affected his music, he said, "is that I don't practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, Ruth; a son, Dean; a daughter, Barbara; a sister, 
and four grandchildren.

UCLA'S ZIDEK SINKS HOOKS INTO WOLFPACK; BRUINS: CENTER IMPRESSES HIS DAD IN 
FINAL EFFORT BEFORE CONFERENCE GAMES START, 88-80. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his father watching from the stands for the first time in his four-year 
UCLA career, George Zidek was calling for the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellowing, actually. Demanding . 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just his call," point guard Tyus Edney said. "I know when he's making 
that noise, get the ball to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek did not disappoint his father, George, Sr., a coach on the Czech 
Republic national team who flew in from the Czech Republic on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing single coverage for the first time in weeks, George Jr. flung in hooks 
from far and wide and sparked the Bruins to an 88-80 victory over North 
Carolina State before 12,075 at Pauley Pavilion on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek, who almost left UCLA for good two off-seasons ago because he was 
frustrated at his lack of playing time, also grabbed eight rebounds despite 
seeing limited time in the first half because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 But, on the advice of his father and Edney, Zidek stayed in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just good to show my father how I've spent the last three years of my 
life," the 7-foot Zidek said. "Just glad he's able to see it worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 It worked out for UCLA too. 
</P>
<P>
 As the second-ranked Bruins (6-0) head into conference play next week, Zidek's 
13 points on six-of-nine shooting in this low-octane possession-by-possession 
contest was especially vital. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I get the ball one-on-one, I should be able to score," Zidek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek's most impressive basket came as the Bruins made their game-winning push 
early in the second half, a sweeping 15-foot right-handed hook that stunned 
North Carolina State Coach Les Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one hook. . . . In the NBA, you're not going to be able to stop that 
one," Robinson said. "He did a nice job." 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek said the big hook -- "that was at about my limit," Zidek said -- was 
just like a practice shot, since the Wolfpack fell back and let him take it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was going for him from the beginning of the game," Edney said. "He 
wanted the ball tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Edney laughed when asked about the sling shot from 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really had trouble with him all night," Edney said. "And when he took 
that one shot, I really was confident. I've seen him do that in practice so 
many times, any time he's swinging, I think it's going in." 
</P>
<P>
 With Zidek sitting out much of the first half after picking up his third foul, 
the Wolfpack (5-2) hustled its way to a three-point lead on UCLA with less than 
five minutes remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 For the half, North Carolina State had 10 offensive rebounds, compared to 
UCLA's three. In the game, the Wolfpack outrebounded UCLA, 37-33, and forward 
Rickey Daniels led everybody with 14 (eight offensive). 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a little George Mason in us in the first half," Bruin Coach Jim 
Harrick said, referring to last week's run-and-gun victory over the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 "But George gave us a lift in the second half. He was hard to guard tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 A big defensive push gave the Bruins a 40-35 lead at half, and a 16-7 run to 
start the second upped the UCLA lead into double-digits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins came out in the second half determined to let the shot clock wind 
down when they had the ball, with the seniors converting at the end. Senior 
forward Ed O'Bannon led the Bruins with 21 points and Edney had 20 points and 
eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Edney: "We wanted to try to keep our composure, keep under control on 
offense in the second half. I thought we did a pretty good job." 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina State made a late run triggered by freshman guard Ishua 
Benjamin, who led all scorers with 22 points, and closed the deficit to under 
10 points with a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here probably thinks that hey, UCLA had to fight against a weak 
team," Robinson said. "But we're not a weak team. And I hope we'll show that 
when the conference starts." 
</P>
<P>
 Edney consistently cut through the Wolfpack press and converted six of seven 
free throws to ice the game. Overall, UCLA made 25 of its 29 free throws -- 
86.2%.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was a really good game for us heading into conference," Edney said. 
"They're a good team, and in the Pac-10 we're going to have a lot of games like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman forward Kris Johnson, who had been sidelined with a stress fracture 
in his right leg, played for the first time since the season opener and played 
four minutes, grabbing two rebounds. . . . Guard Marquis Burns did not play 
because of a sore back, but is expected to be available next week when the 
Bruins open Pacific 10 play by visiting the Oregon schools.

NBA ROUNDUP; JAZZ BEATS PACERS FOR 8TH IN ROW

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Hornacek scored 22 points and Karl Malone added 21 as the Utah Jazz 
extended its winning streak to eight games with a 117-95 victory over the 
Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 John Stockton added 18 points and 12 assists as Utah won for the 15th time in 
its last 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller scored 18 points to lead Indiana, which had defeated Denver 
before taking on the well-rested Jazz, who had not played since completing a 
6-0 trip last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller made seven of 10 shots, including a three-pointer, but was shadowed 
throughout the game by Hornacek. Byron Scott scored 16 points, and Sam Mitchell 
added 15 for the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah improved its record against Eastern Conference teams to 11-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 105, Boston 97 -- The only thing that bothered Coach Phil Jackson 
about his Bulls after their victory at Boston Garden was his team's lack of a 
killer instinct. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good win, but I was disappointed we got out to an 18-point lead and 
the Celtics were able to bring it back to six," Jackson said. "I thought the 
guys, when they were ready to run, would want to push it up to 25. Instead they 
messed around and let the Celtics back into the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls did manage to hold onto an eight-point victory as Toni Kukoc scored 
27 points and six other Bulls joined him in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 B.J. Armstrong, Pete Myers and Will Perdue scored 13 points apiece; Scottie 
Pippen added 12 points and 11 rebounds, and Steve Kerr and Bill Wennington each 
contributed 11 points as the Bulls won their fourth straight game at Boston 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics dropped their fourth consecutive game and 11th in their last 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 91, Washington 75 -- Hot as they are, the Cavaliers still are taking 
no team for granted. Not even the Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We walk a fine line. We can't expect to walk onto the floor and have teams 
roll over for us," Mark Price said at Cleveland after the Cavaliers moved to 
the brink of a team record with their 10th consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Phills scored 22 points and Tyrone Hill had 21 points and 15 rebounds 
for Cleveland, which needs one more victory to match the franchise mark of 11 
in a row set last February and March. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, which has lost 10 of its last 11, was held to 31 points in the 
second half and finished with a season-low total. It marked the fourth time 
during the winning streak that the Cavaliers have yielded fewer than 80 points; 
only one team has reached 100 against them during that span. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 101, Detroit 93 -- Patrick Ewing came up big in New York just as the 
Knicks were getting smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing matched his season high with 30 points, and Derek Harper and John Starks 
each hit two three-pointers in the final minutes to help the Knicks end a 
three-game losing streak at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the Knicks' sixth straight against the Pistons, who dropped 
their fourth in a row and ninth in 10 games despite 24 points by Joe Dumars and 
21 by rookie Grant Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, whose starting power forward Charles Oakley underwent toe surgery on 
his right foot earlier in the week, lost backup center Herb Williams to a 
broken left hand early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 121, Philadelphia 102 -- Kendall Gill scored five of his 25 points in 
the final 3:34 while leading a late 17-5 surge in Tacoma, and the SuperSonics 
won their 13th straight home game. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Dana Barros and Willie Burton, the 76ers trimmed a 23-point first-half 
deficit to 104-97 before Gill, Gary Payton and Detlef Schrempf sparked 
Seattle's big finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Payton and Schrempf scored 23 points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Anderson of the New Jersey Nets was a no-show at practice. "It's always 
something," Coach Butch Beard said. "Somebody's always gone. Somebody's always 
missing. It will drive you crazy sometimes. I don't know where he is. He's 
AWOL. He's probably getting some rest, but I'm a little surprised that he's not 
here." Center Derrick Coleman, recovering from a badly cut hand, returned to 
the team. . . . Don Nelson, who has missed the Golden State Warriors' last five 
games while recovering from viral pneumonia, is expected to return to the bench 
Tuesday at Oakland against the San Antonio Spurs.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; HILBERT IS UCLA STAR IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathy Olivier, UCLA women's basketball coach, turned in surprise to Nickey 
Hilbert at halftime of Wednesday's game against Kentucky at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, you're having fun out there, aren't you?" Olivier asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more than ever this season, Hilbert was. And that made all the 
difference as UCLA defeated Kentucky, 74-65. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt so much more focused before this game than I did before other games," 
Hilbert said. "I just told myself, 'We have to go out and we have to win this 
one. It's a doubleheader (with the men's team), and it would be great for the 
crowd.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The attendance, 1,326, was the Bruins' largest home attendance of the season 
by far, probably because the men followed with a game against North Carolina 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbert, a sophomore guard from Long Beach Millikan High, scored 16 points to 
lead UCLA (5-3) over Kentucky (3-6), which has lost six consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Nickey is one of the most exciting basketball players in the (Pacific 
10) conference with her quickness," Olivier said. "She really doesn't have a 
weakness right now, and once she knows that and feels like, 'I can dominate. I 
can own some people,' she will be so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbert's performance provided a glimpse of what might be for the Bruins this 
season. But there is room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA allowed a 10-point lead to slip away in the first half and committed 25 
turnovers to Kentucky's 19 in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 However, UCLA made 18 of 32 free throws (56.3%) to Kentucky's three of six 
(50%). 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins went on a 13-3 run to open a 10-point lead with 6:51 remaining in 
the game, and the Wildcats never got closer than six points after that. 
</P>
<P>
 However, UCLA had the opportunity to put the game away much earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We start to play with a little consistency and, as a coach, you start to 
relax a little, and then all of a sudden, bam, we take five steps back," 
Olivier said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA led, 30-20, with 6:16 remaining in the half, but Kentucky's Chrissy 
Roberts made a three-point basket to spark the Wildcats on a 12-0 run. Hilbert 
made a baseline jumper and a layup to give the Bruins back the lead, but Kim 
Denkins answered with another basket for the Wildcats, ending the half at 
34-34. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have that leader who exerts confidence yet," Olivier said. But 
Hilbert is making a strong bid to earn that spot. WENDY WITHERSPOON

MORNING BRIEFING: DON'T BLINK OR YOU'LL MISS '94 HIGHLIGHTS

 After a year of work stoppages, lockouts, controversy and very little glory, 
C.W. Nevius of the San Francisco Chronicle isn't very cheery about the 1994 
goings-on in the sports world. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been the year of the press conference," Nevius writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Has there ever been a year when so many chubby men with such bad haircuts, 
wearing such dull suits, spent so much time on television leaning into a 
microphone? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports used to be a move down the lane, a deep pattern to the goal post, a 
long drive down the left-field line. Now it's a quick first step to the 
podium." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Nevius: "Let's face it, the biggest story of the year involving a sports 
figure was a guy in a white Bronco driving up and down the L.A. freeways at 
below the speed limit. Weird, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 "We said we wanted more women in sports, but we didn't expect it to be 
prosecutor Marcia Clark."

 In your bass: Phoenix Sun forward Wayman Tisdale, an aspiring bassist, has 
signed a record deal with MoJAZZ, Motown Records' jazz division. 
</P>
<P>
 "My music speaks for itself," Tisdale said. "I know there are people who 
believe that a basketball player can't play great jazz, but I've been blessed 
with two gifts and I'm going to carry them both out to the best of my ability."

 Toe woes: Nike shoes can do many things, but, apparently, they cannot fix what 
ails the toe of New York Knick forward Charles Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
 First, reports Shaun Powell of Newsday, the specially designed shoe made by 
the company he endorses was late arriving, and when it arrived, it didn't help. 
Oakley discarded the shoe and sat out four games because of the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 With another Nike-designed shoe, Oakley played well in two games before 
finally giving in. Not only did the latest remedy fail to provide the necessary 
cushion, but Oakley said the shoe caused him to sprain his ankle several times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just too much," Oakley said as he made the decision to scrap the shoe 
experiment and undergo surgery. "I really can't get any lift."

 Orlando Sentinel columnist Barry Cooper was outraged when Chick Hearn dared to 
say that he thought Pat Riley would replace Orlando Magic Coach Bob Hill next

 Cooper retorted: "Hill has done an outstanding job and shouldn't be subjected 
to apparently groundless speculation about his future. That's why you're a 
pinhead, Chick."

NEWSWIRE: OWNERS WILL CALL UMPIRES OUT AFTER WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't strike II, it's lockout I in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's second labor dispute began Wednesday when owners notified umpires 
they will be locked out after this weekend and won't be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 National League President Len Coleman said the umpires received the lockout 
notification by overnight mail. Umpires are paid on a year-round basis and 
their four-year contract expires Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The union's request for a 60-percent pay increase is astronomical," Coleman 
said. "Given the tenor of the times, these demands are completely out of 
order." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the umpires' union filed unfair labor practice charges against both 
leagues with the National Labor Relations Board office in Philadelphia, 
accusing the leagues of bargaining in bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Misery doesn't love company in this case," said players' union head Donald 
Fehr. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the players' strike completed its 139th day. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore Oriole shortstop Cal Ripken has the blessing of striking players if 
he wants to cross their picket line to keep his consecutive games streak alive, 
according to The Houston Post. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Astros relief pitcher Todd Jones said the union has told Ripken it 
won't mind if he's on the field with strikebreakers if that is how owners 
insist on starting the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken has played in 2,009 consecutive games and is 122 games shy of breaking 
Lou Gehrig's major-league record. Hockey 
</P>
<P>
 There was no contact between the NHL and its players association and none 
planned, leading sources connected with the league and the union to say 
negotiations probably won't resume until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 It's expected that Commissioner Gary Bettman will then urge union chief Bob 
Goodenow to reconsider his stance of refusing to talk as long as the NHL 
continues to seek a payroll tax or concessions from players on salary 
arbitration rights. 
</P>
<P>
 A league source said Bettman is not prepared to cancel the season and denied 
reports the commissioner has set a deadline of Jan. 6 for a season-saving 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 A settlement after Jan. 1, however, would result in a season of fewer than 50 
games, the minimum previously established by the league's Board of Governors.

TROJANS PRESS RIGHT BUTTON TO WIN, 91-83 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC forward Jaha Wilson's sweat-drenched uniform said it all about the 
Trojans' 91-83 comeback victory over Southern Methodist in the first round of 
the Seton Hall/Meadowlands basketball tournament Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we came out of the locker room for the second half, we knew that we had 
to leave our hearts out on the floor if we were going to win," Wilson said of 
the seven-point halftime deficit. "It's all about attitude, and we didn't want 
to be a team that traveled all this way to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to their full-court trapping press, which helped force SMU into 20 
turnovers, the Trojans rallied behind Wilson's 21 points, 16 rebounds and two 
blocked shots to advance to tonight's championship game against Seton Hall, 
which defeated Lehigh, 90-59, in the other first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which rose above .500 for the first time this season at 5-4, shot 65.4% 
from the field in the second half and had five players score in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Executing Coach Charlie Parker's up-tempo attack, the Trojans wore down SMU 
after struggling against the Mustangs' outside shooting for the first 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 SMU took a 47-40 halftime lead behind former Manual Arts High standout Troy 
Matthews and Jemeil Rich, who combined for 28 points -- including seven of the 
Mustangs' eight three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, however, the Trojans caught SMU by surprise with their 
press, outscoring the Mustangs, 20-5, in the first six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to save our press until the second half, so that they wouldn't have 
time to make adjustments," Parker said. "We used it a little in the first half 
and saw that it gave them some problems. We backed off, so we could make our 
run in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy worked to perfection as USC turned the game into a track meet. 
With 10 minutes remaining, the Trojans were ahead, 71-57, before SMU rallied 
briefly at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't handle the press at the start of the second half," SMU Coach 
John Shumate said. "We were on our heels for the rest of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 In easily their best game of the season so far, the Trojans received a huge 
boost off the bench from sophomore Stais Boseman, making his debut after being 
academically ineligible for the first six weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brings excitement to the team," Parker said of Boseman, who had 15 points, 
five assists and five steals in 23 minutes. "His play inspires everyone to play 
harder. His return means so much because the players see him making plays, and 
they go out and try to do the same." 
</P>
<P>
 USC's scoring balance was a major factor. Lorenzo Orr, who brought the Byrne 
Arena crowd of 9,734 to its feet with three spectacular dunks, scored 18 
points. Burt Harris had 15 points and five steals, Brandon Martin 11 points and 
eight rebounds. Claude Green scored seven points as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the players to win," said Wilson, who had his third double-double this 
season in points and rebounds. "If we play every game like we played the second 
half, we will be all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews and Rich led SMU with 21 points apiece.

LOYOLA IS FLAT, LOSES TO GAUCHOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Loyola Marymount fell behind by 19 points in the first half Wednesday night 
against UC Santa Barbara, the most vocal of a group of students seated near 
courtside reacted predictably. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over-rated, over-rated," they chided the struggling Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola responded with a furious rally, twice cutting its deficit to one point 
midway through the second half before reverting to early form and losing, 
91-72, before 2,136 at the Thunderdome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't play (well) for long stretches," Loyola Coach John Olive said. 
"I have no explanation why in the first 17 minutes we didn't play the style of 
basketball we've become accustomed to -- playing hard and playing aggressive, 
defending and rebounding. It just wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola, which made a season-low 34.3% of its shots in last Friday night's 
75-60 loss to Wisconsin, made only three of its first 19 shots against the 
Gauchos and had 13 turnovers in falling behind, 31-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve guard Cobi McElroy led the comeback, making six of nine three-point 
shots and scoring a career-high 20 points in 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the second half, McElroy scored 15 consecutive points for the 
Lions, all on three-point baskets, the last cutting Santa Barbara's lead to 
54-53 with 9:09 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, we caught a little fire but we didn't really do it consistently on 
the defensive end," Olive said. "We just happened to get hot offensively, which 
got us back in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 A layup by Mike O'Quinn, who also scored 20 points, cut Loyola's deficit to 
56-55 with 8:29 left, but Lelan McDougal made a three-point shot to start a 
13-3 run that put Santa Barbara (5-2) back in control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we ran out of gas, and that's what happens so often after you spend 
so much energy getting back into the game," Olive said. "There's no question we 
didn't have enough energy to close it out the way we should have, and that's 
because of the first 17 minutes of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (6-3) made 51.5% of its shots in the second half after making only 
30.8% in the first half, but Santa Barbara, which got 17 points from Tecon 
Madden and 16 from McDougal, shot 64.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola's Jim Williamson, averaging 13.5 points after eight games, missed all 
nine of his shots and failed to score.

NORTHRIDGE FOULS OUT IN NEW MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy looked at the statistics and four 
numbers glared back: 
</P>
<P>
 Six and 11. Thirty-six and 47. 
</P>
<P>
 The small numbers were Northridge's shooting from the free-throw line. The 
larger ones belonged to New Mexico, which had just defeated Northridge, 86-73, 
in the first round of the Lobo Invitational before a near-capacity crowd of 
15,736 at the Pit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a good defense for free throws," Cassidy said. "I guess we 
played Ma Bell defense. We reached out and touched someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (2-6) led by as many as 11 points in the first half. The Matadors 
made 11 three-point baskets to New Mexico's two, but simply couldn't overcome 
the Lobos' scoring at the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Hayden led New Mexico (5-4) with a career-high 26 points, making 14 of 
17 free throws. Marlow White added 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Oronoz scored a career-high 18 points for Northridge, which has lost 
three games in a row. Ryan Martin had 13 points. MIKE HISERMAN

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; IT'S NO SURPRISE WHEN HOOSIERS TROUNCE COLONELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Indiana has never lost a game in the Hoosier Classic, and Eastern Kentucky 
Coach Mike Calhoun had little hope his Colonels would end the streak in 
Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we came in here and won this first game, it would have been nothing short 
of a miracle," Calhoun said after a 92-49 Indiana victory in the first round of 
the tournament Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "An earthquake or something would have to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Henderson scored 20 points and grabbed eight rebounds to lead the 
24th-ranked Hoosiers (7-4). Brian Evans had 19 points, and freshman Michael 
Hermon scored a career-high 16 points to help Indiana to its fifth consecutive 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Arizona 95, Richmond 68 -- Damon Stoudamire keyed Arizona's 32-6 burst 
in the first 10 minutes of the second half as the Wildcats blew past Richmond 
in the Fiesta Bowl Classic at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (8-2) will face Texas Tech (4-3) Friday in the championship. It has 
won each of its nine previous tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire, who scored 19 points and triggered an intense defensive effort, 
made three of his five three-pointers after Arizona led, 46-36, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of Corey Williams' 13 points came on two three-pointers and a jumper, 
and Ben Davis, making his first start, converted a free throw and scored on a 
layup and jam during the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Richmond's Kass Weaver led all scorers with 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 12 Georgetown 83, Grambling 66 -- Allen Iverson had 27 points and five 
steals and broke open a close game with a late spurt in the first round of the 
Sacramento Holiday Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoyas (6-1) are undefeated since opening their season with a loss to 
Arkansas. Othella Harrington had 16 points, and his five rebounds moved him 
into 17th place on Georgetown's career rebounding list -- only six behind NFL 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
 Iverson, who as a Georgetown freshman is prohibited by team rules from giving 
interviews until next semester, used his quickness to control the game at both 
ends of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Iverson scored most of his points on slashing drives to the basket, but his 
biggest impact came on defense -- where his quickness disrupted the Grambling 
offense and caused many of the Tigers' 24 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 14 California 79, Columbia 43 -- Tremaine Fowlkes scored 18 points to lead 
the unbeaten Golden Bears to their seventh victory in the opening round of the 
Otis Spunkmeyer Classic at Oakland. Tony Gonzales and Monty Buckley had nine 
points for Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 16 Arizona State 65, Pacific 50 -- Ron Riley scored a game-high 17 points 
to lead Arizona State past Pacific in the first round of the ASU-Tribune 
Classic at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State (8-2) will face Vanderbilt (6-1) in the championship game 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State led, 36-35, with 13:35 remaining before Riley keyed a 12-3 run 
with four points and a pair of steals. Isaac Burton finished with 15 points and 
Mario Bennett had eight points and 12 rebounds for the Sun Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 20 Cincinnati 69, No. 17 Georgia Tech 66 -- Freshman Danny Fortson had 20 
points and nine rebounds to lead the Bearcats in the opening round of the 
Rainbow Classic in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati (8-3) took the lead for good at 66-64 on a backdoor layup by 
LaZelle Durden with 1:30 to play. Neither team scored on its next possession, 
but Art Long came through for the Bearcats when he tipped in his own miss with 
21 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton Johnson's three-pointer with 49.4 seconds remaining gave Nevada Las 
Vegas its first victory of the season, 56-55 over Miami in the inaugural Orange 
Bowl Basketball Classic in Miami. . . . Erwin Claggett became the 
fourth-leading scorer in St. Louis history and the Billikens won their 22nd 
consecutive home game, 71-54, over Austin Peay. . . . Kwame Evans had 17 points

Hall won its sixth in a row by beating Lehigh, 90-59 in the first round of the 
Seton Hall-Meadowlands tournament in East Rutherford, N.J. . . . Eric 
Washington and Jason Caffey each scored 25 points and Antonio McDyess had 12 as 
Alabama beat Texas Christian, 83-64, in the Otis Spunkmeyer Classic.

BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; BILLINGSLEY HAS RIGHT TO ENJOY UPSET VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fountain Valley's 36-35 victory over Santa Margarita wasn't pretty, but it put 
a smile on the face of Baron Coach Gordon Billingsley. 
</P>
<P>
 He was beaming Wednesday after Fountain Valley advanced to the semifinals of 
the Orange Holiday Classic boys' basketball tournament.The Barons' victory at 
Chapman University came over previously unbeaten Santa Margarita, the 
fourth-ranked team in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our biggest win this season," Billingsley said. "It's always nice to 
give a team its first loss." 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons (7-4) were facing defeat in the final seconds, but Daniel Keller's 
driving layup along the left baseline gave Fountain Valley the lead for good, 
35-34, with 20 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 After Santa Margarita (11-1) turned the ball over on its next possession, 
Keller made the front end of a one-and-one situation with 10 seconds remaining 
to make it 36-34. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita had one last chance when Nick Maroutsos drew a foul with two 
seconds remaining. After Maroutsos made the first free throw, the second 
rattled in but popped out and Fountain Valley's Javier Scalini grabbed the 
rebound to end the game.  
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles struggled against Fountain Valley's match-up zone and shot 31% from 
the field. Dennis Keane and Allen Krist led Santa Margarita with eight points 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley battled through equally frigid shooting -- making only 28% 
from the field -- but made the plays that counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Paul Tayyar scored 14 points, including four three-pointers, and had 11 
of the Barons' 16 points in the second quarter to give Fountain Valley a 21-19 
lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phil Domingo (six points) didn't score much, but I thought he controlled the 
boards," Billingsley said. "Paul stepped up and had a big game tonight. Mike 
Arvesen hit a big three-pointer in the fourth quarter." MICHAEL ITAGAKI

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; MATER DEI'S PRESSURE GETS TO NEWPORT HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This game between the county's third- and fourth-ranked girls' basketball 
teams -- both unbeaten -- was supposed to have been closer. 
</P>
<P>
 But No. 3 Mater Dei choked off Newport Harbor's offense with a gripping press 
and scored a 71-50 victory in the quarterfinals of the Marina tournament 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (7-0) scored 27 consecutive points to initiate the blowout. A 
22-19 score with 4 minutes 22 seconds left in the half became 49-29 with 5:36 
left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei plays No. 6 Fountain Valley tonight in one semifinal at 6:30 p.m. 
No. 5 Marina plays Bellevue (Wash.) Eastlake in the other, at 8 p.m.. 
</P>
<P>
 Melody Peterson scored a game-high 23 points, including 16 before halftime, 
and Rhonda Gondringer had 15. Through three quarters, Mater Dei made 28 of its 
47 shots from the field (59.5%), many of them coming off turnovers it forced 
with the press. Allison Luckey, who scored eight points, had five steals, and 
Mater Dei had a 32-point lead going into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our style -- pressure them all the time until we wear the other team 
out," Mater Dei Coach Mary Hauser said. "When they get tired, they make 
mistakes. We pressed whenever we scored. If we can't score, we can't press." 
</P>
<P>
 And there was no problem scoring for the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 75% of their offense is their defense," Newport Harbor Coach Shannon 
Jakosky said. "You can't play into their hands and make silly passes because 
most will end in a lay-in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to learn is to get out here and experience it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarch pressure was too much for Newport Harbor (8-1), which relied on a 
sophomore, Jenny Jennings, and a freshman, Andree Verhulst, to take care of the 
ball. But it was too much to ask of the young players. Newport Harbor committed 
25 turnovers -- 10 in the second quarter and seven in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Hollis scored 11 points and Michelle Meyers had 10 for Mater Dei. 
Mandy Clayton, who kept Newport Harbor close with 10 first-quarter points, 
finished with 14. MARTIN HENDERSON

<P>
 In the Reebok/Above the Rim tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei 93, Merced 48 -- Mater Dei's competition is getting easier and the 
Monarchs' play keeps getting better. The result was a blowout in the 
quarterfinals at Torrey Pines High in Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving a scare in the first round against San Diego Scripps Ranch, 
the top-ranked Monarchs (14-1) have had two consecutive laughers. Wednesday's 
game, played before a crowd of about 2,000 that included Jerry Tarkanian, was 
close for about five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei led Merced (8-5) by three points before going on a 29-7 run the 
final 11 minutes of the half. Senior guard Clay McKnight was the spark as he 
hit five three-pointers in the half, and finished with six three-pointers on 11 
attempts and 20 points after scoring only six Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore forward Schea Cotton had his second consecutive spectacular game, 
scoring 28 points on a wide array of rim-rattling dunks and pretty inside 
moves. About the only area Cotton didn't dominate was on the perimeter, where 
he was one of five from three-point range. He made 10 of 16 shots overall and 
grabbed six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Shaun Jackson added 20 points, 10 rebounds, three blocks and three 
assists. Point guard Kevin Augustine was the only Monarch who didn't play well, 
scoring just three points and committing eight turnovers in 20 minutes of play. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei will play Queens (N.Y.) Christ the King (6-1) in tonight's 
semifinals at 7:30. Christ the King is led by 6-6 junior forward Ira Miller, 
who scored 17 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in Wednesday's 73-69 quarterfinal 
victory over Riverside North. DAVE McKIBBEN

 Sisters Amber and Mindy Miller each scored a goal to lead Fountain Valley to a 
3-0 victory over El Toro in the semifinals of the Ocean View Holiday Classic 
girls' soccer tournament Wednesday at Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons advanced to the title game against Ocean View at 1 p.m. today and 
gave first-year Coach Brandee Craig plenty to be happy about. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very exciting," Craig said. "It made me feel a little more secure 
seeing that we can play at that level, against a team with a solid reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley's 12-1-1 record is impressive but before this tournament, the 
Barons hadn't played many tough teams. Their only loss was to Cypress in the 
title game of the Magnolia tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fountain Valley defeated Corona del Mar, 1-0, in a quarterfinal earlier 
Wednesday and easily dispatched El Toro (6-4-3). The Chargers defeated Mater 
Dei, 2-0, in another quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Amber Miller, a freshman, gave the Barons a 1-0 lead with about two minutes 
left in the first half. Miller took a pass from Sharon Gillis on the right 
flank and had only goalkeeper Heather Lindstrom to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Four minutes into the second half, Amber Miller centered the ball to sister 
Mindy, a junior who turned and scored from point-blank range. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the way Fountain Valley controlled the action, the 2-0 lead was 
very safe. When the ball did go into the Barons' end, Gillis, the sweeper, and 
defensive halfback Debbie Blake made sure El Toro's chances to score were rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the game, Gillis scored on a free kick from about 40 yards. Gillis' 
booming kick bounced over the head of El Toro goalkeeper Melody Derloshon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other Ocean View Holiday Classic semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View 2, Palos Verdes Peninsula 1 -- Kim Engesser scored one goal and 
helped set up the other as Ocean View (9-1-1) rallied to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula (8-4-2) took a 1-0 lead 10 minutes into the second half when Tori 
Giles lofted a shot over goalkeeper Jacquelyn Knebel. 
</P>
<P>
 But five minutes later, Peninsula goalkeeper Colleen Sharkey stopped a long 
free kick by Karen Dawes. Engesser was there to knock in the rebound and knock 
down Sharkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Then with 14 minutes left in the game, Engesser pushed a pass through to 
Jessica Funke, who passed to Janea Veal, who scored from close range. MARTIN

TV RATINGS; IT WAS A MERRY CHRISTMAS FOR ABC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Claus was good to ABC this Christmas. The network continued its winning 
streak in its battle with NBC, CBS and Fox, with six of its shows landing in 
the Top 10, according to figures released Wednesday by A.C. Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC also had cause for holiday cheer. Its Monday night showing of "One 
Christmas," starring Henry Winkler and Katharine Hepburn, was the highest-rated 
Christmas special of the week, coming in at No. 8 and trouncing its 
competition--CBS' "Best of 'Taxi"' retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was also some coal in NBC's stocking --its "Countdown to Christmas" 
special, which aired on Christmas Eve, was almost dead last in the ratings (No. 
84). 
</P>
<P>
 Among the numerous other Christmas specials, CBS' "Kathie Lee's Christmas" 
with Kathie Lee Gifford and the animated "Mickey's Christmas Carol" drew 
significant audiences. But there were humbugs for other specials, including 
CBS' "Opryland's Country Christmas" (No. 39), "Night Before Christmas" (No. 
51), ABC's "Wish That Changed Christmas" (No. 55) and Fox's "90210 Christmas 
Special" and CBS' "Television Christmas Classics" (tied for 56th). 
</P>
<P>
 A Christmas night showing of "Touched by an Angel" in the Sunday "Murder, She 
Wrote" time period also failed to jingle many viewers' bells. The drama came in 
at No. 46.

KID STUFF: ICY DESERT OASIS; FOR 'ALADDIN,' DISNEY DOES MORE THAN SKATE BY WITH 
THE SUGGESTION OF SAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aladdin zipping over a field of ice may seem as unlikely as a walrus trudging 
across the Sahara, but the show biz mavens at Disney are hoping kids and their 
parents can see beyond the incongruity. 
</P>
<P>
 Their newest family-geared skating blitzkrieg, "Walt Disney's World on Ice -- 
Aladdin," comes to The Pond of Anaheim on Wednesday through Jan. 16. What 
audiences will get is Aladdin and his now-familiar friends and enemies from the 
animated movie spinning, leaping and sending up sprays of ice shavings as they 
make their way through a little Arabian Nights adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to imagine what a real Arab, accustomed to sun-dried days and sandy 
horizons, might think of all this chilly action. But Robert Little, one of the 
program's creators (he helped adapt it and designed the sets), says youngsters 
here will just think it's cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be pair numbers, romantic numbers, thrill acts, jump-skating -- 
all tied to elements of the story that are both romantic and exciting," he said 
during a recent telephone interview from Tampa, Fla., where he's helping to 
produce the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus' latest touring show. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all that, how can we go wrong? Well, we think people who loved the movie 
will enjoy this. . . . We tried to create the same feeling as the movie -- the 
hustle and bustle of the bazaar, the arid dunes of the desert, the opulence of 
the palace." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Little agreed that putting on ice Aladdin, the poor boy who dreams of 
being a prince, seems an odd concept. But if Disney could make a skating 
extravaganza out of "Beauty and the Beast," another popular full-length 
cartoon, then why not "Aladdin"? 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, the staging attempts to create an environment that conjures 
up the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's usually an area that separates the audience from the rink; well, 
we've done some interesting things with that," Little explained. "We've 
actually turned it into sand dunes to give the right feel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then there's the lighting and sound effects. They give the impression of a 
sandstorm raging away, especially at the (show's) beginning . . . this is an 
exotic production." 
</P>
<P>
 As with "Beauty and the Beast" and other Disney "World on Ice" 
programs,"Aladdin" uses overlapping taped recordings of dialogue and music 
while the "skater-actors" go through their routines. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot closely follows the movie: Aladdin and his monkey pal, Abu, try to 
save the kingdom from the bad-guy sorcerer, Jafar, with the help of Genie. 
Aladdin's sweetheart, Princess Jasmine, gets in on the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Little said that much of the program's family appeal comes from the sets, 
which cost about $1 million. Elaborate, colorful designs closely reflecting 
those of the film are featured in each scene, Little explained, adding that 
he's most proud of the climax, when Jafar is transformed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's when Jafar finally gets hold of the lamp, then he first changes into a 
giant cobra snake, then a gigantic evil genie," Little said. "It's like a magic 
trick at mid-ice, using very complicated special effects. I think it's a real 
accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Little also isn't worried that the controversy hounding the "Aladdin" movie 
will leak onto the ice show. Some Arab Americans protested the film, charging 
that it portrayed Arabs in unflatteringly stereotypical ways. Disney denied the 
criticism but did agree to change some lyrics in a signature song, "Arabian 
Nights," which had been condemned as racist. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just my opinion, but I think that was a pretty minor dust-up," he 
said. "Disney solved the whole thing by changing a few lines. I don't think 
there will be any lasting effects." 
</P>
<P>
 Little and Kenneth Feld, the lead producer for the show, also want fans of the 
"Beauty and the Beast" ice show to know that "Aladdin" will be a different 
experience. "Beauty and the Beast" was more romantic, they said, while 
"Aladdin" is geared toward action. 
</P>

EVENTS; FIRSTS AND LAUGHS; KWANZAA, FULLERTON FESTIVALS END YEAR WITH 
BEGINNINGS; OTHERS GO FOR THE JOKES

<P>
 This New Year's weekend, the bars and restaurants and concert clubs will be 
hopping, and there will no doubt be parties galore. Amid the standard-issue 
revelry, however, will be a few less traditional ways to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art, the African American holiday of Kwanzaa 
will be marked Saturday from 1 to 4 p.m. Beginning each year on Dec. 26 and 
lasting for seven days, Kwanzaa ( first fruits in Swahili) was created to 
correspond with traditional African festivals of harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Bowers was host to an event that observed both Kwanzaa and 
Hanukkah, but this year the focus will be on Kwanzaa. There will be food, 
music, tours of the museum's African art holdings and dramatic readings telling 
the story behind the holiday, developed in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Nixon of the museum's African Arts Council (sponsors of this year's 
event) estimates that more than half of the 200 or so people who attended last 
year were learning about Kwanzaa for the first time. He hopes this year to 
teach more about the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is "certainly to educate people in the community about Kwanzaa as an 
American -- and particularly an African American -- celebration," Nixon 
explained. "We're obviously doing this for education, but it traditionally is a 
family celebration." 
</P>
<P>
 Kwanzaa "basically centers on positive values," expressed in the Nguzo Saba -- 
seven principles. The principles are Umoja (unity), Kujichagulia 
(self-determination), Ujima (collective work and responsibility), Ujamaa 
(cooperative economics), Nia (purpose), Kuumba (creativity) and Imani (faith). 
</P>
<P>
 During Saturday's event, a different person (some of them children) will 
explain each of the principles. The event is free and will be held in a 
conference room at the museum, 2002 Main St. in Santa Ana. Information: (714) 
567-3600. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another family-oriented event is the fourth annual First Night Fullerton, 
which will again feature live entertainment, activities for kids and a 
fireworks show. 
</P>
<P>
 Held from 7 p.m. to midnight, First Night Fullerton is touted as an 
alcohol-free way to welcome the New Year. It is modeled after "First Night" 
events held in other cities and pioneered in Boston in 1976, as a finale to the 
nation's Bicentennial celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's event drew a crowd estimated at 10,000. This year, almost 100 
events will be held at more than 30 indoor and outdoor sites throughout 
downtown Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The festivities begin with a "People's Procession" down Harbor Boulevard at 7 
p.m., in which everyone is invited to take part. Events held throughout the 
evening include screenings of silent comedy shorts, roots music by Little Jonny 
and the Giants, industrial music by Tunnelmental, numerous theater performances 
and storytellers, international dance and a midnight fireworks show. 
</P>
<P>
 Attractions include an outdoor roller-skating rink, a karaoke pavilion, and 
children's activities that include face painting, a petting zoo and pony rides, 
and kiddie cars. All events are within walking distance of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone wishing to attend must purchase a button that grants entry to all 
events. Advance sale prices are $8 for adults, $5 for children 12 and under. On 
the day of the event, adult button prices go up to $10. Buttons will be sold 
Saturday at booths throughout downtown Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Special events administrator Ann Mottola recommends two parking areas: one is 
the Plummer Auditorium parking lot, at Lemon Street and Chapman Avenue near 
Fullerton College; the other is the Transportation Center on Pomona Street just 
south of Commonwealth Avenue. For information on the event, call (714) 
738-6545. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pop New Year's events are listed on Page 13, but we'll mention a couple of 
musical offerings here. One is billed as a "Cajun New Year's Eve Celebration" 
starring the irrepressible Queen Ida and her Zydeco band. It begins at 10 p.m. 
Saturday at La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts, 14900 La Mirada Blvd., 
La Mirada. The $50 ticket price includes Cajun-Creole food and champagne. 
Information: (714) 994-6310 or (310) 944-9801. 
</P>
<P>
 Another is "Praise '95," Saturday from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. at Knott's Berry Farm, 
8039 Beach Blvd., Buena Park. The slate of Christian pop performers includes 
Bryan Duncan, Geoff Moore & the Distance, Audio Adrenaline, Crystal Lewis, 
Guardian, the Gospel Gangstas (a Christian rap act), Dream of Eden and Scott 
Blackwell's Righteous Dance Party. Country line dancing will also be offered. 
Tickets are $20 to $22, which includes all shows and attractions at Knott's. 
Information: (714) 220-5200. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, those looking to welcome 1995 with a few laughs have a couple of 
options that feature local comedy and theater talent. One is the Orange County 
Crazies, presenting "Orange Lang Syne" Saturday at the Orange County Crazies 
Theatre, 115 E. Santa Ana Blvd., Santa Ana. Refreshments will be offered at 9 
p.m., with the show beginning at 10 p.m. and wrapping up at midnight. Tickets 
are $25. Information: (714) 550-9900. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in Santa Ana on Saturday, there's "The Way Off the Wall New Year's Comedy 
Celebration" at the Way Off Broadway Playhouse, 1058 E. 1st St. The show is a 
compilation of comedy sketch, song, dance and improvisation. Also on tap will 
be door prizes, hors d'oeuvres, champagne at midnight, party favors and 
dancing, all starting at 9 p.m. Tickets are $25. For those who want to keep on 
celebrating, the show will also be offered Jan. 7 and 14 at 8 p.m., with a $12 
price tag (show and dancing only). Information: (714) 547-8997.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK

 "Bulk" 
</P>
<P>
 Medium Cool - Twin/Tone  
</P>
<P>
 * Times Line(tm): 808-8463. To hear an excerpt from "Bulk," call TimesLine and 
press *5550 
</P>
<P>
 The year's longest new rock release at well over two hours, the double-CD 
"Bulk" was also the year's least pretentious, and the purest in adherence to 
rock's populist traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan lives in Georgia, works as a mechanic and, in his spare time between 
1985 and 1993, wrote and recorded a bunch of rock 'n' roll songs with shifting 
lineups made up of his buddies. With its 42 songs, "Bulk" compiles the pick of 
eight years of prolific music-making completely removed from the music 
industry's often-distorting gravitational pull. Logan and his mates draw freely 
and omnivorously upon most of the styles that inform thinking-person's rock, 
using country, folk, Chicago and rural blues and Stones-inspired garage rock as 
their foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Listeners who want their music to shine with polished brilliance should skip 
"Bulk": These are definitely basement tapes, although the sound clarity is more 
than adequate for an appreciation of Logan's wide-ranging art. The loose but 
intensely felt performances and the generally melancholy outlook of the 
material recall Neil Young's memorable wake of an album, "Tonight's the Night," 
which also was made in a spirit of community between musicians, rather than as 
a project with commercial designs. Logan has a nice gift for black humor and 
skewed, deadpan wit, which adds a rich dimension to a vision that is ultimately 
chastened and brooding. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparisons to Elvis Costello and, especially, American Music Club are in 
order. But Logan's husky singing is distinguished by a gentleness and stoicism 
that run counter to Costello's lash-out bile or the anguished theatricality of 
AMC's Mark Eitzel. Listening to the low-keyed Logan, one gets a sense that 
disappointment is inevitable, and that raging over it would be unseemly. That 
doesn't mean he doesn't feel intensely: Logan and his friends do assert 
themselves, but they never sound as if they're straining for effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with that sense of restraint, Logan as lyricist is given to 
painting miniatures rather than going for the grand, abstract statement. His 
gift for detail comes across in such sketches as "15 Years in Indiana" and 
"Weatherman," two portraits of characters driven toward madness -- the first in 
a slow water-torture of flat, featureless existence, the second in an acute 
psychotic break. 
</P>
<P>
 It's my guess that there are Jack Logans everywhere, discerning musicians who 
love rock, who think hard about life and who have the talent to channel that 
love and those thoughts into vivid songs. The requisite business connections 
elude them, or the drive for stardom just happens not to be part of their 
makeup. It's nice when the music industry -- in this case an independent label 
not known for star-making ambitions -- brings one of them to light.

 It's tiny bubbles time again. New Year's Eve pops off Saturday with a slew of 
parties across Orange County. From house to swing, the options to toast 1995 
are tied by plenty of style. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors Tony Curtis, Tia Carrera, Eric Roberts and other surprise celebrity 
guests will count down the clock at Roxbury South in Santa Ana. Easy Street 
will rock the bar below, while dance devotees can groove to hip-hop, old 
school, disco and Top 40 upstairs with DJ Shervin. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Joseph Pennezuto will serve a four-course feast and all the bubbly needed 
at one all-night sitting beginning at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The $75-a-plate cost includes admission to the club. Entry without dinner is 
$25 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover includes party favors and a midnight champagne toast. The club and 
restaurant are open from 8 p.m. until 2 a.m. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach's Thunderbird is throwing a glitzy bash fitting almost every 
dance taste. A rockabilly band will be shakin' it upstairs, while a jazz band 
will be holding court in the lounge below. DJ Sean Perry brews a steamy mix of 
disco, funk and house jams in the dance room. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's in-house restaurant, Toukan, will serve Cal-Caribbean cuisine until 
1 a.m. A first seating at 6 p.m. is $55 per person, increasing to $75 after 9 
p.m. (Price includes cover to the club). Those skipping the dining pay $20, 
which includes party favors and a complimentary bottle of champagne. Doors open 
at 6 p.m. Black-tie and formal wear are encouraged, and for men there's a

</P>
<P>
 Across the way, Visions offers an evening less hard-hitting on the pocketbook 
and wardrobe. A $10 cover after 10 p.m. includes a midnight toast and party 
favors. DJ John Elliot spins Top 40, and Modern Faith will crank the hits live. 
For $34.95, revelers can enjoy the festivities with a steak or seafood dinner. 
First seating starts at 5:30, followed by a second at 8:30 until 10:30 p.m. 
Dinner includes a bottle of champagne or non-alcoholic sparkling cider for 
every two people. The club opens at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>

 The Empire Ballroom in Costa Mesa will also combine vinyl dance grooves with 
the live rock of Awol. The $30 ticket includes an all-you-can-eat buffet by 
Newport's Chez Fey from 9 until 11:30 p.m., as well as party favors, hats and 
the ubiquitous toast. The party kicks off at 9 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 The Empire Ballroom is at 640 W. 17th St., Costa Mesa. (714) 722-6100.  
</P>
<P>
 If "death to disco" is your mantra, check out the following gigs. Just as 
glamorous, but to the tune of a different drummer: 
</P>
<P>
 Country music lovers can step into '95 at the Country Rock Cafe in Lake Forest 
under the mirrored saddle. The good times get going at 5 p.m. with a DJ and 
Western-style buffet for $25, including all the expected trappings -- cover, 
toast, party favors as well as reserved seating. Cover without dinner (which 
ends at 9 p.m.) is $10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Country Rock Cafe is at 23822 Mercury Road, Lake Forest. (714) 455-1881. 
</P>
<P>
 Big-band fans will want to swing over to the Red Lion Grand Ballroom for an 
elegant evening in supper-club form, complete with orchestra. Tickets, 
including dinner and toast, are $125 each couple or $65 for singles.  
</P>
<P>
 The Red Lion Grand Ballroom is in the Red Lion Hotel/Orange County Airport, 
3050 Bristol St., Costa Mesa. For reservations and information, call (714)

feast of Latin music and food. A live celebration of salsa, cumbia and meringue 
will be performed by Orquestra Macondo. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of Pop Rock Espanol can hit the adjoining dance hall to hear the vinyl 
stylings of DJ Carlitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserved seating (a must here after a few songs on the floor) and a bottle of 
champagne come with the $30 cover, which can only be purchased at the door. 
Expect to shell out another $35 or so for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 J. C Fandango is at 1086 N. State College Blvd., Anaheim. (714) 758-1057. 
</P>
<P>

DO IT!: SIERRA CLUB COURSE PUTS BASIC SKILLS TO THE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Edition staff.

<P>
 In this age of specialization, there remains at least one bastion for those 
who value all-around skills, at least in the area of mountaineering. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club's Wilderness Travel Course, a 10-week introduction to 
all-around outdoor proficiency, gives participants a taste of backpacking, 
equipment, snow travel, field navigation, wilderness ethics, basic rock 
climbing, mountaineering medicine, winter camping, general safety and rescue 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the 10 lectures, the course entails four field trips: a one-day hike 
that serves as a conditioning test, a weekend at Joshua Tree for rock climbing 
and navigation instruction, a one-day trip to the local mountains to learn snow 
travel techniques and a weekend backpack in the Sierra, where participants will 
put what they've learned to the test in a winter wilderness environment. 
</P>
<P>
 To complete their certification, participants are also required to undertake 
two additional field trips, one of which must be a scheduled Sierra Club 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rigors of the course are real, this is no rugged survival school; 
safety remains the first concern. Instruction is given by experienced Sierra 
Club volunteers who have undertaken advanced wilderness training. Each weekly 
lecture, on a single topic, is handled by a different expert. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilderness Travel Course is offered by the Angeles Chapter of the Sierra 
Club once a year in three locations.  
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, lectures will begin Jan. 10 on Tuesday evenings at 7:30 at 
REI in Santa Ana. Four classes, each with about 25 students, will be offered 
this time around. Advance registration is recommended, but Orange County 
chairman Harry Freimanis said people will probably be able to sign up at the 
first meeting (just arrive early -- registration opens at 6 p.m. that day).  
</P>
<P>
 Dates for the field trips are: Jan. 28 or 29 for the conditioning test, Feb. 
11 and 12 for the Joshua Tree trip, Feb. 25 or 26 for the one-day snow travel 
outing, and March 10-12 for the snow camp in the Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 The course is also offered in the San Gabriel Valley beginning Jan. 17, and in 
Long Beach beginning Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the local Sierra Club operated the popular Basic Mountaineering 
Training Course, but rising liability insurance costs in the mid-'80s killed 
that venture. The Wilderness Travel Course debuted a few years later, minus 
some of the more technical elements of the earlier course. It was first offered 
in Orange County in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Sierra Club Wilderness Travel Course. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Tuesdays at 7:30 p.m. and some weekends, Jan. 10 to March 14. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Lectures at REI, 1411 S. Village Way, Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: From the Costa Mesa (55) Freeway, exit west at McFadden Avenue 
and turn left onto Village Way. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: $135 for Sierra Club members, $150 for non-members. Plus $18 
for a required textbook ($21 on the first day of class). 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 496-3972.

SPOTLIGHT; A TENSION SHOPPER; IS GETTING RID OF STRESS AT THE TOP OF YOUR TO-DO 
LIST? READ ON, AND RELAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some love all the presents and parties, the wrapping and decorating, the 
dreidels and the bourbon balls. But let's face it: Beneath all that 
season-specific cheer, the true, undying essence of the holidays is, in a word, 
stress.  
</P>
<P>
 Mall stress, spending stress, cooking stress, traffic stress, 
fighting-off-offers-to-eat-more stress, drying-Christmas-tree stress, 
card-sending stress, and the one so close to us all, 
repetitive-dysfunctional-family-gathering stress. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do? In a word, de- stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there are lots of ways to do that without going broke or spending 
much time. A manicure and pedicure, for instance, can cost as little as $15, 
which is about the cheapest hour of nerve-soothing massage anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who best de-stress by burning off steam, an hour at the shooting 
range might be the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people come in and draw their bosses face on the target," says Scott 
McPhillips, an employee at Straight Shooters, a range in Orange where firing 
away runs as low as $4.95 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoga and meditation can work their wonders too, as can kayaking and other 
outdoor sports that combine endorphin-boosting with nature's calming effect. A 
visit to a nearby hot spring, a massage, some garden puttering, batting 
practice or Tai Chi can change your perspective on life. More suggestions 
follow. From Tip to Toe  
</P>
<P>
 To the uninitiated, a nail parlor might come off as a cross between a Big 
Brother sweat shop and a torture chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Nail Star in Irvine, all workers, situated at small stations arranged 
in two straight rows, face the same way. Their heads bent in toil, they wear 
hospital masks to avoid inhaling the dangerous chemicals. The frightening buzz 
of electric drills comes too close to the sound of dental work. Worse, 
customers are forced to listen to Phil Collins on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hour, however, Phil sounds positively transcendent. Last month's 
Redbook magazine makes absorbing reading, and the chemical smell -- some nail 
products contain substances "known to the state of California to cause birth 
defects or other reproductive harm" -- ceases to annoy. The water we drink is 
worse, goes the rationalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Parlors are plentiful in and around Orange County, but the $15 
manicure-pedicure at Nail Star is one of the cheapest indulgences on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 After she has delicately trimmed errant cuticles and filed and buffed, 
Michelle Vuong, at station No. 9, gives one of nail parlordom's all-time 
longest massages, spending a full five minutes -- about double the average -- 
on each hand and lower arm. 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for Vuong's pedicure: five minutes for each foot and lower leg 
-- with lotion, of course. It starts in the usual way, with a foot bath in a 
vibrating tub of sudsy warm water. Even the buzz of those drills -- used to 
file fake acrylic nails -- softens to a soothing hum. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parlors serve men and women, although many, including Nail Star, cater 
mostly to women. Men, who typically forgo polish, should demand equal rights -- 
this is pampering not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 An essential reminder: For a pedicure with polish, take open-toed sandals so 
toes may dry on the way home. Also, face masks are not required but are 
strongly advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Nail Star, 5365 Alton Parkway, Irvine, (714) 551-2009. Hours are 9 a.m. to 7 
p.m. Monday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday. Targeting the Tension  
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hobbs, 31, visits Straight Shooter, the Orange shooting range, every 
other week. Adjusting his earphone-like hearing protectors, he takes his place 
in one of 16 narrow "lanes" dividing the 50-foot-long range. Then, he pushes a 
button activating a wire trolley that carries his paper target, soon to be shot 
through with holes, to the desired distance. Steadying his gun with both hands, 
he shoots repeatedly, littering the carpeted floor with bullet casings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a stress relief," says the towering Anaheim Hills resident, who 
drives a gas tanker for a living. "It gets out a lot of your aggression. You 
just go out there and go ugh-ugh-ugh! . . . I'd come in every day if I could." 
</P>
<P>
 To fire with accuracy and avoid potentially fatal accidents, shooters must 
concentrate exclusively on the task at hand, explains range employee Phillip 
Bao. Thus, for an hour at least, cares and concerns disappear -- or else. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could get dangerous, if you forget that a round (or single bullet) is left 
in your gun," Bao says. "You have to be self-conscious the whole time." 
Technically speaking, "you definitely have to focus on one thing," and that's 
the gun's "front sight," a small spot atop the barrel's end that must be 
properly aligned to hit a bull's-eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Shooters need to slow themselves down, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to breathe slower, and you have to relax," says Bao, who sums it up 
with the acronym BRASS: Breathe, Relax, Aim, Stop and Squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% of Straight Shooter's clientele is female; whole families visit too. 
Children must be at least four-feet tall, but those of any age may shoot. 
First-timers will flinch from the bang of guns firing, but they get used to it, 
Bao says. 
</P>
<P>
 Straight Shooter, 1935 Enterprise Ave., Orange. Open 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. 
Range time is $4.95 an hour, Monday through Friday until 5 p.m.; $6.95 an hour 
after 5 p.m. and all day on weekends. All guns rent for $3.95 an hour. Clients 
may use their own guns and ammunition, providing the latter is full-metal or 
lead. Ammunition is $1.99 to $12.99 for 50 rounds. Information: (714) 637-4668. 
Out and a Boat  
</P>
<P>
 At dawn several mornings a week, neurologist Susan Skinner sculls the Back Bay 
for the most restful hour of her hectic day. 
</P>
<P>
 Only her narrow boat and long, slender oars disturb the otherwise-still water. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no other boats on the bay," Skinner says, "and there's nothing out 
but the birds. The sun is rising over Saddleback Mountain, and sometimes at the 
same time, the moon is setting over Catalina. It's unbelievably beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 "You fall into repetitive motion, and you kind of become one with the boat, 
and you reach a point where it feels like you're flying over the water. I find 
if I can't go, I just don't feel as calm, as relaxed during the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Skinner, of Newport Beach, is one of many recent converts to rowing, says Joe 
Seager, an employee at the nonprofit Newport Aquatic Center, where Skinner 
works out. Paddle sports, including kayaking and canoeing, have taken off with 
the proliferation of more affordable water sports outlets, Seager says. 
</P>
<P>
 While these sports can be challenging physically and mentally, they can also 
be leisurely, particularly during the winter months, when there are fewer 
people on the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Seager recommends kayaking for first-timers because it is easier to learn than 
the others. After just five minutes of instruction, beginners can enjoy an hour 
on the bay. Tipping over isn't likely either, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can get out there and do it," he says. "How far they go with it is 
totally up to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Aquatic Center, 1 Whitecliffs Drive, Newport Beach. Open 6 a.m. to 7 
p.m. daily. Kayaks rent for $10 an hour for one passenger, $13 an hour for two 
passengers. Canoes rent for $10 an hour. Ninety-minute introductory clinics 
cost $10. Information: (714) 646-7725. People Who Knead People  
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing like a massage to ease tension, especially if it doesn't cost 
too much. Emily Lietz of Costa Mesa will rub you down for $25 per half an hour, 
which is about the least you can expect to spend. For that price, Lietz will 
fluff your aura, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a smoothing out of the energy field we all have around us," says Lietz, 
who performs this act by sweeping her hands above the client's body. "I work 
from the feet up, and fluff upward to make you feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 Lietz, a.k.a. "stress therapist," has worked at Oliver's beauty salon at the

small room at the back of the salon where she dims the lights and plays soft 
instrumental music on a boombox.

 "When someone comes to see me," she says, "I check to see if they have a hurt 
(muscle) someplace or where their stress points are. Most people have shoulder 
stress because that's where they hold most of their tension. If a person has a 
hurt, you don't need to massage hard."

 A proponent of so-called aromatherapy, Lietz applies various scented oils 
purported to have beneficial effects, either relaxing or stimulating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like rose geranium, which is good for cleansing, for detoxifying, and it 
helps with stress. I use a high-grade massage oil if someone is dieting and 
they want a stronger detoxification." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Lietz's clients are businesswomen (although men visit too) who pop in 
for a quick pickup, but some loyal customers book a night at the hotel and 
spend a day in the spa, which also offers facials, manicures, pedicures and 
hair care.

includes a one-hour massage, a one-hour facial (with neck and shoulder massage) 
and a massage of hands, arms, elbows, feet and legs with a paraffin wax hand 
and foot treatment. A half-day package includes some of the above plus other 
services and lunch.

 Sometimes just getting out of town is relaxing. Escaping to a hot spring goes 
that idea one better. 
</P>
<P>
 Murrieta Hot Springs Resort and Health Spa, a relatively affordable retreat 
about an hour's drive away in Riverside County, has 18 indoor mineral baths. 
Each is about the size of a deep bath tub, into which the natural mineral water 
is pumped from an original source 50,000 feet beneath the Earth's surface. The 
water comes out of the ground at 140 degrees, but the bath temperature is 
adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
 The mineral water is also pumped into three outdoor pools on the Spanish-style 
resort's palm- and Eucalyptus-tree-lined grounds. Use of the indoor mineral 
baths, in the resort's spa, costs $14 for 25 minutes; use of outdoor pools 
costs $10 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural elements and minerals in the water, such as calcium, sodium and 
magnesium, are "absorbed into the body," says spa director Marcia Bennett. They 
stimulate natural bodily functions such as joint lubrication, relieving 
stiffness. Hydromassage (air jets in the mineral baths) soothes too. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-minute massages and facials, mud treatments (see accompanying story), 
seaweed body masks, a sauna, acupressure and other services are offered in the 
spa. There's a fitness center with weightlifting and exercise equipment, a 
restaurant and overnight lodging. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't do any healing here," Bennett says. "What we do is enable the body 
to realize its own full potential, which means with massage, we just press 
right places on muscles to enable them to relax, and (through the mineral 
baths) provide the body with ways to stimulate its own natural resources." 
</P>

 Murrieta Hot Springs Resort and Health Spa, 39405 Murrieta Hot Springs Road, 
Murrieta. Take the Riverside (91) Freeway east to the Corona (15) Freeway 
south. Exit at Murrieta Hot Springs Road. The spa is about four miles down on 
the left. Indoor mineral baths, $14 for 25 minutes; use of outdoor pools costs 
$10 for the day. Overnight packages begin at $89 a person, double occupancy, 
for one night's lodging, a 50-minute massage, one mineral bath, unlimited use 
of pools, sauna and fitness center and one continental breakfast.  
</P>
<P>
 The spa is open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Saturday and Sunday. Outdoor pools open 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day.

 People think that Chris Jensen, corporate communications director of a 
software firm, has a secret. No matter how frenzied the job gets, no matter how 
intense her deadlines, she manages to stay cool, calm and collected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day," Jensen recalls, "a woman said to me, 'How do you do it? 
You're always so focused and calm?' 'Well,' I said, 'I do yoga.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Jensen's been practicing yoga for 16 years and is one of half a dozen 
volunteer teachers at the nonprofit Yoga Center of California in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "You develop a center of relaxation in yourself," she says, "and it doesn't 
really matter what's going on around you." 
</P>
<P>
 Classes at the Yoga Center, a nondescript, modestly appointed storefront 
facility opened in 1970, begin with Hatha yoga postures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We react to stress by putting tension in the body," Jensen says. "The 
postures generally help us release the tension." 
</P>
<P>
 "We emphasize not straining and being very careful, and we teach breath 
practices and end with 10 minutes of deep relaxation." 
</P>
<P>
 Classes then progress to other yoga forms, such as Bhakti, Raja and Gjani, 
which emphasize meditation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the portion where we actually help people let go of the turbulence in 
their mind," she says. "The peace of mind you get from meditation is what helps 
you react differently in stressful situations." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent intermediate class at the center, some 45 students, most dressed 
in sweats, performed a string of such postures as the cobra, the lotus and the 
corpse, all the while breathing deeply and evenly -- one of yoga's key 
relaxation techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Leo Scott, 69, said after the class that he took up yoga some 30 years 
ago. Back then, his rheumatoid arthritis was so severe that he'd developed a 
bleeding ulcer from taking pain medication and "the doctors were going to 
operate on the back of my hands and elbows because I had big lumps of bone 
there, all because of the arthritis." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott avoided the surgery by developing flexibility through yoga, and his 
ulcer healed when he gave up the painkillers. He practices postures and 
meditates daily at home and attends class on Tuesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has stress, no matter what kind job you're in, but if I have a lot 
of work that has to get done, and lots of pressure, come Tuesday night I can't 
wait to get to yoga because Wednesday is my best day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yoga saved my life."  
</P>
<P>
 Yoga Center of California, 445 E. 17th St., Costa Mesa, admits new students 
once a month. Free, two-hour demonstrations for newcomers are held monthly. The 
next demonstrations will be Tuesday at 10 a.m. and Wednesday and Feb. 1 at 7:30 
p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Ongoing classes, about 2 1/2 hours each, are held Monday and Tuesday at 7 
p.m., Sunday (advanced) at 6:45 p.m. and Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. Registration, 
which is $54 a month, covers two classes a week. Information: (714) 646-8281.

SPOTLIGHT; TRIED & TRUE; ONE WOMAN'S MUD IS ANOTHER'S MUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Zan Dubin is a staff writer for the Times Orange County Edition. 
This column is one in an occasional series of first-person accounts of leisure 
activities in and around Orange County.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I had joked with a friend the night before: "Doreen, tomorrow I have one of my 
toughest assignments in 10 years at the paper. I have to take a mud bath at 
Murrieta Hot Springs." 
</P>
<P>
 She gushed: "Take me with you!" 
</P>
<P>
 Now I wish she had gone without me.  
</P>
<P>
 The stench, familiar to most anyone who has been to a spa, hit the moment I 
walked in the door. Trying to keeping an open mind, I thought: It's a good 
stench, the stench of replenishment, rejuvenation, health. 
</P>
<P>
 Murrieta's natural hot springs bubble up from the earth at 140 degrees, 
replete with calcium, magnesium, potassium and other minerals that are 
"absorbed into the body," I'd been told by the management. That stimulates such 
natural bodily functions as joint lubrication, hence relieving stiffness and 
soreness. 
</P>
<P>
 The smell was simply sulfur, one of the hot springs' natural elements. So what 
if it stunk like rotten eggs? 
</P>
<P>
 The next part wasn't so bad either. Hey, I'm a grown-up, I thought; I 
shouldn't feel weird about walking around wearing nothing but a blue sheet. So 
what if this place, like most other spas, didn't segregate the sexes? Lying 
face down on a plastic-covered massage table wasn't heaven, but I could deal. I 
was, after all, going to be covered with imported mud -- shipped all the way 
from Austria -- that would extract my toxins and exfoliate my dead cells. My 
skin would feel like buttah , and my cares would vanish. 
</P>
<P>
 But when my cheerless "Bodyworker" slathered burning hot mud on my calf with a 
paintbrush, I lost it.  
</P>
<P>
 "Owww, that's too hot!" I screeched. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodyworker ran out, returning with a cup full of ice. She poured the ice into 
the bowl of black mud, and, apologizing, slathered up the rest of me with 
cooler mud. Then the real torture began. 
</P>
<P>
 She wrapped my slimily muddy body snugly in plastic -- gross -- and said she'd 
be back in about 20 minutes. My collarbone, splattered with a little mud, 
started to itch like mad, which was a major problem because my arms were pinned 
at my sides, mummy-style. I had a little room to move, but I didn't want to 
feel the slime sloshing around between the plastic sheets. Gross.  
</P>
<P>
 I tried to relax.  
</P>
<P>
 I lay there, praying that Bodyworker would come back early, but she didn't, so 
I gritted my teeth, took a breath and moved my arm through the slime and 
plastic to scratch. It was as squishy as I'd imagined, but, ahh, relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Until both legs started to itch. Then my left arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodyworker had said before she left that I could holler if I needed her. Yeah, 
right. Above the din of a nearby mineral bath-cum-bubbling hot tub, I couldn't 
hear much myself, let alone expect her to hear me, so I did this horizontal 
dance thing for the remaining, interminable 10 minutes, jiggling and twitching 
to momentarily quell the itching. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Bodyworker returned, propped me up and waddled me to the mineral bath 
to rinse off. 
</P>
<P>
 As I sat there bathing in my own, now toxin- and dead cell-flecked mud, 
scratching my itch with a mud-stained loofah, I concluded that a hot bath and a 
loofah at home would have had been just as good. But relaxing.

SPECIAL SCREENING: 'DUEL AT DIABLO' STRAYS FROM HERD OF WESTERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lance writer who regularly 
covers film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Duel at Diablo" is a reasonably efficient and entertaining Western by 
journeyman director Ralph Nelson, who will never be compared to John Ford. But 
a number of things make the film noteworthy.  
</P>
<P>
 For one, "Duel at Diablo" is credited as the first Western to feature a black 
actor in a starring and heroic role. And the actor was Sidney Poitier, making 
his debut in the genre. The movie also introduced mainstream American audiences 
to Swedish actress Bibi Andersson, known mainly in art houses as Ingmar 
Bergman's favorite leading lady. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture (which screens Wednesday and Jan. 6 at the Cypress Senior Citizen 
Center) can further be appreciated for its eager '60s idealism. 
</P>
<P>
 Made in 1966, "Duel at Diablo" steers away from the usual frontier cliches: 
The Indians may be savages, but they're sublime ones, forced to rampage by 
their miserable life on the reservation. And the movie goes beyond that, 
offering a not-so-subtle message about racial understanding and acceptance just 
under its bullets-and-arrows surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersson (who doesn't try to conceal her accent, which is never explained) 
plays the wife of the town's shopkeeper (a typically harried Dennis Weaver). 
Having once been in love with the chief's son, she would rather be living with 
the Apaches. But they've forced her out of the tribe, believing her somehow 
responsible for the death of her Apache lover during an encounter with 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, she was forced to leave their baby with the tribe. And when she 
kidnaps the infant with the help of Jess (James Garner), a solemn, do-gooding 
drifter, everybody jumps on the warpath, including the U.S. Cavalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Jess also has a story to tell. He was married to a Comanche woman and has 
endured the hate of bigots for years. When not helping strangers, Jess is on a 
mission to track down the man who murdered and scalped her. 
</P>
<P>
 Poitier is along for the adventure as an ex-sergeant turned fancy-man gambler 
who makes the mistake of tagging along with the cavalry as they head into 
Indian territory. He's the coolest guy out there -- quick with a quip and the 
best shot around. None of the cowpokes or soldiers dare call him by the "N" 
word, especially when he leads them in a last, seemingly hopeless battle with 
the Indians while trapped in Diablo Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson can get awfully ham-fisted in laying out the storyline, but he and 
screenwriters Marvin Albert and Michel Grilikhes have their conscience in the 
right place. Besides, there's enough action to satisfy most Western fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The director stages a frantic clash on horseback between the Indians and 
soldiers, and a few nifty shots (cinematographer Charles F. Wheeler's camera 
dramatically follows an arrow as it hits home) enliven the wild finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the '60s influence improves "Duel at Diablo," it does have at least 
one laughable repercussion. Neal Hefti's musical score, which is -- gratefully 
-- only intermittent, is hilariously inappropriate. It sounds more like the 
backdrop for a soulful episode of "The Mod Squad" than for a Western set just 
after the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Ralph Nelson's "Duel at Diablo." 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Wednesday, Jan. 4, and Jan. 6 at 12:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: The Cypress Senior Citizen Center, 9031 Grindlay St., Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Take the San Gabriel River (605) Freeway to Lincoln Avenue and 
head east to Grindlay Street, then go right. 
</P>

KIDS ON FILM; MONEY CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS, BUT 'RICHIE' CAN AFFORD LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for the Times' Life & Style 
section.

<P>
 In "Richie Rich," the lonely 12-year-old son (Macaulay Culkin) of billionaire 
philanthropists hooks up with a ragtag group of sandlot ballplayers to outwit 
the evil corporate schemer Lawrence Van Dough (John Larroquette), who is after 
the family fortune and business, Rich Industries. (Rated PG)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Belinky, 11, had expected a movie for rug rats. The ads were juvenile, 
and when he walked into the theater, he could see it was filled with little 
kids. But he was surprised by the action, the suspense, the still-charming 
Macaulay Culkin and, most of all, by the endless array of cool gadgetry 
belonging to Richie Rich, the world's richest boy, whose devoted parents have 
hired an in-house inventor/scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was great," said Alan, who saw the movie twice in its first week 
in release. 
</P>
<P>
 The second time, he took his friend Matthew Sayad, 11, who was equally 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved it," he said. "It was just a really good movie for kids. And for me, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 "The inventions were really cool," Matthew chipped in. 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite was Robo Bee, a remote-controlled mechanical bee, used to sting 
Van Dough's henchmen as they cornered the scientist.  
</P>
<P>
 He also liked the "Kidapult," a catapult that launched kids into the air and 
onto a giant air bag on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan was fascinated by the Dadlink, a full-size computer with a jumbo screen 
map that could pinpoint his father's location anywhere in the world at any 
time. Richie's loving and indulgent father doesn't mind if he calls him at work 
-- even if he's in the middle of lecturing the President on basic economics. 
("You can't spend more than you take in.") 
</P>
<P>
 The Dadlink plays a crucial role when Van Dough's schemes cause Richie's 
parents to disappear. Pitted against the cigar-chewing Van Dough, Richie, his 
neighborhood friends and his loyal butler Cadbury, also get to use Cementia, 
the strongest cement in the world, and things like the "sub atomic molecular 
reorganizer."  
</P>
<P>
 Other kids were surprised to find that the movie was also rich in heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be like 'Blank Check,' " said Marina Mayer, 9, referring 
to a similar movie about a super rich kid pitted against evil villains. "But it 
wasn't as boring and slow. Here, it was like he had everything, but he didn't, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
 He has his own McDonald's. He has professional baseball players as coaches. 
But, until the neighborhood kids get to know him, the mature and likable Richie 
Rich, isolated and groomed for corporate responsibility, doesn't have any 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the purpose was really good, like money can't buy friends," Marina 
said. "That's the most important thing you can have." 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a love-your-enemies message, even as Richie and his rediscovered 
parents fend off the murderous Van Dough. In this movie, unlike Macaulay 
Culkin's star vehicle, "Home Alone," he feels bad and apologizes before bashing 
the villains. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina and her sister Tiffany, 11, said they are both fans of child star 
Culkin, whose popularity shows no signs of abating even as he rounds the turn 
into adolescence.  
</P>
<P>
 Alan and Matthew agreed. "He's a good actor," Matthew said. "He's getting 
better, actually." 
</P>
<P>
 But as Alan pointed out, there may be a good reason he seemed so perfectly 
cast for this role. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the third-richest boy in the world," he said.

NEWSBITES / BENJAMIN EPSTEIN: IT'S AULD LANG DINE, AS EATERIES OFFER WAYS TO

 Year out and year in, the traditional New Year's Eve ingredients stay the same 
-- champagne and caviar for some folks, beer and party mix for others, 
nonalcoholic drinks for the designated drivers. But beyond that, every bar and 
restaurant in town has its own recipe for a perfect evening. A sampling:  
</P>
<P>
 For the bargain-conscious, the Airporter Club at the Atrium Marquis Hotel 
gives a nod to the old year on Saturday night with a buffet and show for 
$19.94. Dinner is served from 5 to 7:30 p.m., and your buffet ticket guarantees 
a seat for lounge pianist Greg Topper's show (age 21 and over) and dancing from 
8:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. If that's not enough, the coffee shop stays open until 4 
a.m., and the $59 room rate includes a continental New Year's Resolution 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Byron Gemmell, best known for posts at Gemmell's, Chanteclair and Cassis, is 
now executive chef at the Atrium Marquis (formerly the Airporter Garden Hotel). 
In the Palmira Grill, Gemmell offers a four-course New Year's Eve meal with 
choice of appetizers including tureen of scallops with spinach and entrees 
including rack of lamb. Early dinner seatings, $80 per couple without tax or 
tip, begin at 6 p.m.; the "gala" seating, $140 per couple, begins at 9 p.m. and 
includes reserved seating at the Topper show. 
</P>
<P>
 Epicures might head to Gustaf Anders. A five-course menu promises Osetra 
caviar with souffleed blini; black truffle ravioli with parsley beurre blanc; 
steamed salmon on lemon-scented spinach and pear compote; venison with morel 
sauce and celery root timbale, and a dessert buffet. The 6 p.m. seating is $80 
per person; 8 p.m. seating is $95 and includes entertainment and dancing; both 
prices include a bottle of Champagne but not tax or tip. 
</P>
<P>
 Revelers can find fine food at a fine price at Amici Trattoria, at least at 
the early seating. From 5 to 9 p.m., the restaurant offers soup or salad, 
choice of four entrees -- including veal chop with truffles and fontina cheese 
or venison in peppercorn and wild berry sauce -- and a side of pasta for $30 
per person plus tax and tip. A second seating, $75 per person all-inclusive, 
begins at 10 p.m. and features four courses as well as live music and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 For its five-course dinner and Roaring '20s-style New Year's Eve party, the 
Robert Mondavi Wine & Food Center eschews Champagne in favor of its 
top-of-the-line Reserve wines. Courses include a lobster scallop pot pie and 
baked Alaska. Suggested attire is black tie or vintage clothing. Dinner at 8 
p.m., dancing until 12:30 a.m. The price is $135 per person, including tax and 
gratuity, but there is a waiting list.  
</P>
<P>
 New Year's Eve can be murder on those who get carried away. At the Sheraton 
Newport, it can be "Murder at Cafe Noir," a four-course dinner (dessert is an 
almond cone with white and dark chocolate mousses, creme anglaise, raspberry 
puree and caramel), performance of a 1940s-style whodunit by Mystery Cafe (kids 
welcome) and post-show party; $69 per person is all-inclusive.  
</P>
<P>
 A main ingredient for a successful New Year's Eve is being with someone you 
love, or someone you hope to love, or even, for Auld Lang Syne, someone you 
loved once upon a time. But the most important ingredient may be a late-night 
cab ride: Don't drink and drive.

 Everything's just ducky since McCormick & Schmick opened its Pilsner Room 
recently, but they'll be duckier still at both the restaurant and pub through 
Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 About 50,000 fine feathered fans of the Oregon Ducks are expected to flock 
here for the Rose Bowl, and the Portland-based chain is rolling out the yellow 
and green carpet with Dandelion Salad and Lion Tail Soup inspired by the Ducks' 
opponents, the Penn State Nitanny Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bona fide Duck fans -- i.e., those who can sing the school's fight song or who 
wear green and yellow attire -- can enjoy a free piece of Jake's Famous Truffle 
Cake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pilsner Room will serve a commemorative Pasadena Red, created for the 
occasion by Nor'Wester Brewing Co.

RESTAURANTS; RUBY IS GENUINE KOREAN-CHINESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ruby Palace is on a torn-up commercial stretch of Beach Boulevard, far from 
any major Chinese neighborhood. But the food served behind the enormous red 
portals of this Huntington Beach restaurant bears a striking resemblance to 
authentic Chinese. Korean-Chinese, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant is run by the Hsus, a Korean-born Chinese family fluent in at 
least three languages. When I found out where the family came from, I 
immediately asked for two kinds of kimchi, those spicy, earthy pickled 
vegetables that no restaurant in Korea would begin a meal without. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the waiter was reluctant to bring them until I pointedly asked, "Do 
you automatically serve kimchi when the party is Asian?" "Yes," he replied, 
somewhat contritely. There's a common assumption that non-Koreans will be put 
off by kimchi's pungent aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruby Palace would be a very fine restaurant if it didn't unilaterally make 
decisions for the customer this way. Many dishes here are too sweet or too 
salty, but the food can be delicious when the chefs play it straight. On one 
hand, the specials board has featured a horror called sweet cherry ribs, which 
was pork ribs in a sauce that tasted like a famous brand of cough syrup. On the 
other, all will be forgiven when you taste this kitchen's superb steamed 
dumplings or exquisite seaweed soup. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant is pleasant enough to look at, decorated with plenty of 
screens, wood carvings and Chinese lanterns. Unfortunately there are no 
windows, which gives a bunker-like feel to the surroundings. At least they keep 
the lights low here, a welcome departure from the sort of Chinese restaurant 
where the candlepower verges on blinding. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't let the waiter's news that steamed dumplings take 20 minutes dissuade 
you from ordering them. These are great dumplings, chewy and with a light 
minced pork filling. On the side comes a superb dipping sauce of soy and green 
onions.  
</P>
<P>
 But avoid the salt-and-black-pepper ribs, a misguided take on a dish you find 
in most restaurants with a Chinese clientele. Here's the mistake: Instead of 
being made with pounded pork meat, this deep-fried dish is chopped-up ribs. 
It's tasty, but you can never tell whether you're going to bite into meat, fat 
or bone. We gave up after a few bites. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd be tempted to recommend the shredded pork and preserved turnip soup except 
for the salt problem. Preserved turnips are salty to begin with, but the 
kitchen actually adds salt to the broth, making it literally hard to swallow. 
The seaweed soup, however, is masterful: tofu, spinach, seaweed, bean thread 
noodles, egg, shrimp and minced pork, all the flavors showing up clearly 
against the neutral background of a clear broth. 
</P>
<P>
 Many vegetable dishes here are outstanding, such as sauteed string beans, 
sauteed spinach, and black mushroom with Chinese green. I'd steer clear of the 
ultra-bland Buddha's feast and the eggplant with hot garlic sauce -- oily 
eggplant in a ferociously vinegary sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 A party of four can order the restaurant's complete duck dinner for $75. The 
menu is chef's soup, a huge plate of Cantonese appetizers (including barbecued 
spare ribs, fried shrimp and egg rolls), garlic fish, scallops with Chinese 
greens, black mushrooms with bok choy and an entire Peking duck. Smaller, or 
less ravenous, groups might consider a barbecued half duck, only $9.95. This is 
the poor man's Peking duck -- the same appetizing roast duck with plum sauce, 
lacking only the steamed buns and flower-cut green onions. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an even less expensive route. A dish the menu calls roasted spicy 
chicken is, in effect, Peking roast chicken. For only $7.50, you get nearly a 
whole chicken, on the bone, complete with the plum sauce and Peking duck buns. 
It's one of the best values on this menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the restaurant has fresh fish such as sea trout or catfish; ask to 
have yours simply steamed with ginger and green onion sauce. Roast spicy shrimp 
ball would be great if it were just a little less oily. (These are not balls, 
by the way, but rather flat cakes of mashed shrimp and rice crumbs, fried to a 
golden crust). Salt and black pepper shrimp in the shell is much like the rib 
dish mentioned above, in the same oily batter and accompanied by spiced salt 
(oddly, this salt mixture is about 60% black pepper, rendering it the color of 
volcanic sand). 
</P>
<P>
 For those who like a fine, lean pork meat ball in a rich brown sauce, stewed 
meat balls (like the shrimp dish, formed in the shape of flat cakes) is the 
answer. Sauteed long rice with shredded pork is the less fanciful name of the 
dish known in Chinese as "ants climbing tree," because the tiny bits of pork 
virtually swarm throughout the rice mixture. If you fancy pasta, try the cold 
noodle, which comes with a spicy bean sauce. It's a favorite with the Chinese 
community in Korea, especially on hot summer afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert at Ruby Palace can be candied apples, bananas or yams. If you think 
you overdosed on candied yams at Thanksgiving, trust me -- these are not the 
same. They're hot fruit, dipped in molten sugar and corn starch and then 
plunged into a bowl of ice. The fruit stays hot while the coating solidifies 
into a crunchy candy glaze.  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, do try the yams, the best of the three. They're a treat, especially 
when you take some home and eat them the next day.  
</P>
<P>
 Ruby Palace is moderately priced. Appetizers are $3.95 to $16. Soups are $5.50 
to $11.95. Main dishes are $3.50 to $25.

DAY TRIPPIN': WAFFLES AND WINGS IN A WINTER WONDERLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
frequently to the Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lake Arrowhead is the nearest thing we've got to an Alpine resort, and right 
now there's even snow on the ground. The village is less than a mile high, yet 
you can find Angel Wings there, and your Hearts Desire. A mile away you can 
skate to your heart's content. 
</P>
<P>
 9:30 to 10:15 a.m.: Dockside at Lake Arrowhead is among the more scenic 
sections of the Village, and its shops are now fully occupied. You can start 
your morning amid the country Victorian surroundings of the Belgian Waffle 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibilities include a straightforward Breakfast Belgian ($4) but also a 
dozen more involved preparations: Benedict Belgian, a twist on eggs Benedict 
($7.25, mini-Benedict $4.25); apple Normandy Belgian, with spiced apples, 
raisins, walnuts and cinnamon ($7.55), and sundae Belgian, half a waffle with 
ice cream and chocolate or raspberry melba sauce ($4.95). 
</P>
<P>
 I ordered peach melba Belgian with sliced peaches with raspberry melba sauce 
($6.95); the amount of whipped cream served on top looked overwhelming, but the 
cream turned out to be very light, not gooey in the least. A great starter, the 
polar cap is iced mocha cappuccino with milk, chocolate syrup and a "blizzard" 
of that heavenly whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant sells duck food for 50 cents, and there's a bunch of ducks 
waiting to be fed just outside on the dock and in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 10:15 to 10:35: Also Victorian in atmosphere, Angel Wings carries all things 
angelic, including angel jewelry and angel snow globes, as well as all things 
cherubic, and every square inch of the shop is filled with the celestial items. 
</P>
<P>
 The angel books are among the most intriguing. Angels may seem to be a 
Christian belief, for instance, but alongside "Billy Graham on Angels" is "A 
Gathering of Angels: Angels in Jewish Life and Literature"; those of any faith 
might enjoy "Angels in the Kitchen: Divine Desserts for Any Occasion." 
</P>
<P>
 10:35 to 11: "No matter where you go, there you are," reads the sign above the 
door at Hearts Desire. Inside are pieces by Mary Engelbreit inspired by other 
sayings; a ceramic chair with bowls piled on the seat says, "Life is just a 
chair of bowlies." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing your heart might desire when you come in from the cold is a nice pot 
of tea, and this is the place to find interesting teas and teapots. 
</P>
<P>
 Loose-leaf teas include ginger peach, "a longevity tea," according to the 
label, and mango Ceylon, "a metabolic frolic tea." Among teapots are an 
accordion-style Polaroid camera ($40) and a Singer sewing machine ($43); bisque 
porcelain fruit and vegetable teapots include pumpkin and carrot ($19 each). 
Very popular is a Lucy and Desi teapot based on the movie "The Long, Long 
Trailer" that comes with car creamer and trailer sugar ($40, sold-out for the 
holidays, back in stock in January). 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese Yi-Xing teapots ($60) are made from a special clay rich in iron, 
quartz and mica and have a colorful history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The custom was you made your tea in the pot, you drank directly out of the 
teapot, and you never washed it," explained store owner Debbie McGuire. "You 
just rinse it out so that the pot itself creates its own tea flavor after 
continuous use. Neighbors would take their teapots to each other's homes and 
try to outdo each other, so they made them with lots of character. Everything 
was unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop also specializes in die-cast metal, limited-edition, scale-model 
cars, bicycles and airplanes. McGuire said, for instance, that Schwinn is 
marking its 100th anniversary with replicas of the Western Flyer, Lady 
Starliner and Black Phantom models ($55 each). She was less successful when 
describing the origin of the cartoonish limited-edition cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're replicas of the pedal cars that you had when you were a kid," McGuire 
said. "You know, in the '40s and '50s?" 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me?  
</P>
<P>
 "You in general," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 11 to 12:30: Nearby, Blue Jay's Ice Castle is the training site for many 
Olympic gold-medal skating champions, including its artistic director, Robin 
Cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 It has a lovely indoor-outdoor setting. The rink is tented and open to the 
surrounding trees; international flags decorate one end. 
</P>
<P>
 Indoors, you can sit by the fire while replacing lost carbs with a baked 
potato ($1.25), or watch skaters through a glass partition while enjoying a 
frozen yogurt under a heat lamp. There's also a variety of sandwiches ($1.50 to 
$3.50) and candy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rink's shop is a cornucopia of tutus and hockey sticks. Out on the ice, 
safety rules stipulate no snowballs, crack-the-whip or camel spins. Apart from 
that, you "skate at your inherent risk" at the Ice Castle, but the inherent 
risks are well worth it.

<P>
 Brock Jacobsen scored 33 points and had seven assists to lead the Crescenta 
Valley High basketball team to a 70-39 victory over Loara in the quarterfinals 
of the Anaheim Canyon tournament on Wednesday night. The Falcons will face 
Schurr tonight at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobsen, a senior, has scored 74 points in two tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
 Jake Willis added eight points and 10 assists for the Falcons. 
</P>

CAL LUTHERAN WINS A CONFIDENCE-BUILDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It certainly wasn't the play that was called, but Derrick Clark's three-point 
basket with five minutes 11 seconds left in Wednesday's nonconference men's 
basketball game between Cal Lutheran and Nebraska Wesleyan might be remembered 
as the shot that turned the season around for the host Kingsmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran entered the contest saddled with a three-game losing streak, and 
a fourth consecutive loss might have proved fatal to the Kingsmen's confidence. 
But Clark's successful attempt as the shot clock expired began a 10-3 run that 
resulted in an 81-71 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran (5-4) led by 13 points twice in the first half, but the Kingsmen 
were clinging to a 63-61 lead when Clark -- who had attempted only one 
three-point shot all season -- found himself with the ball 21 feet away from 
the rim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the clock was running down so I just tried to relax, get my legs under 
me, and let it go," said Clark, who scored a career-high 31 points to go with 
eight rebounds and four steals. 
</P>
<P>
 After Nebraska Wesleyan (6-2) missed two shots, Clark made a short jump shot 
in the lane to give the Kingsmen a 68-61 lead with 4:43 remaining. Dave Ulloa's 
fifth three-pointer gave Cal Lutheran a 71-62 advantage with 3:12 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska Wesleyan, the No. 7-ranked NCAA Division III team in the nation 
according to the Columbia Multimedia poll, didn't get closer than seven points 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tremendous win for this program," first-year Cal Lutheran Coach 
Rich Rider said. "This is the type of win that you can build on for the rest of 
the season. I think this team, which is very young in a lot of areas, came of 
age tonight. A win like this will do a lot for this team's confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Ulloa scored a career-high 24 points, including 21 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Justin Wilkins made 10 of 12 shots and finished with 21 points for 
Nebraska Wesleyan, which committed 16 turnovers.

 Chaminade forced 22 turnovers as the Eagles posted a 70-39 victory Wednesday 
night over Yeshiva in the first round of the Chaminade tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defense is our philosophy," Chaminade Coach Jeff Young said."We're not known 
as an offensive powerhouse. But we have a pretty well-balanced attack." 
</P>
<P>
 The host Eagles (6-3) had 18 steals, eight by freshman guard Justin Stewart. 
Chaminade didn't trail, and every starter scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade forward Carmine Rossi scored nine of his game-high 13 points in the 
third quarter. Junior Matt Jewitt made all three of his three-point attempts 
before colliding with Yeshiva's Sammy Missry in the third quarter and suffering 
a thigh bruise. Jewitt left the game and didn't return. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade took a 9-2 lead in the first quarter, helped by six Yeshiva 
turnovers in the first three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Hammie cut Chaminade's lead to three, 18-15, by making a three-pointer 
with 5 1/2 minutes left in the first half. But Chaminade responded with a 14-3 
run to lead, 32-18, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade faces undefeated Alhambra (11-0) next. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra 68, Granada Hills 40 -- Michael Contreras scored 19 points and Ryan 
Hart added 16 to lead Alhambra. Ernest Yun had 11 points for Granada Hills, 
while Will Ruffin and Ernest Quinley each scored 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall 55, Rio Mesa 41 -- Marshall led by eight entering the fourth quarter 
then outscored the Spartans, 20-14. Guard David He scored 31 points to lead 
Marshall (4-5). Will Hall led Rio Mesa (1-5) with eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas 70, St. Monica 58 -- All starters scored in double figures as the 
Coyotes (3-5) dispatched the Mariners (2-5). Guard Ryan Coleman led the way 
with 21 points.

NEW YEAR'S; STEAKING OUT THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Year's dinner for two is a perfect excuse to skip the classic roast goose 
or ham and go for something truly extravagant: filet mignon. 
</P>
<P>
 A thick slab of filet mignon smothered with mushrooms isn't the sort of entree 
most of us can afford to serve 20 relatives. But it's just right for an 
intimate supper. In fact, supermarkets are packaging single five-ounce portions 
for smaller households. 
</P>
<P>
 Because filet mignon is mild tasting, it could use some fire. My favorite way 
to prepare it is to press coarsely ground peppercorns into the meat, then saute 
it. The pepper creates a zesty crust. I add vermouth and balsamic vinegar to 
the skillet for a quick sauce with a little bite to it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To start the meal, I recommend a savory twist on the delicious dessert 
combination of pears and blue cheese. Arrange lettuce and pear wedges on salad 
plates. Top with vinaigrette dressing and sprinkle on blue cheese. Add steamed 
Brussels sprouts and a chocolate truffle to complete the dinner. FILET MIGNON 
WITH CRIMINI MUSHROOMS 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 shallot, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound crimini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black peppercorns 
</P>
<P>
 2 (5-ounce) filet mignons, cut 1 inch thick 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup white vermouth 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter in medium skillet. Add shallot and mushrooms and saute 2 to 3 
minutes over medium heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Press peppercorns into beef on both sides. Add beef to skillet and brown 2 
minutes per side. Remove. Add vermouth and cook over high heat, scraping up 
browned bits, until liquid is reduced by half. Stir in vinegar (use enough for 
bite, but not sour taste) and cook 1 minute. Season to taste with salt. Return 
filet mignons to skillet just to heat through, 1 minute. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, place each filet mignon on plate. Top each with half of mushrooms 
and pan juices. Serve immediately. Makes 2 servings. PEAR AND BLUE CHEESE SALAD 
</P>
<P>
 1 head Boston lettuce, separated, rinsed and torn into bite-size pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1 large Bartlett pear, peeled, cored, seeded and sliced into thin wedges  
</P>
<P>
 1 shallot, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon balsamic or Sherry vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons blue cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange half of lettuce on each of 2 salad plates. Arrange pear wedges over 
lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir together shallot, vinegar, oil, pepper and salt in small bowl. Pour over 
salads. Sprinkle each salad with 1 tablespoon blue cheese. Serve immediately. 
Makes 2 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : Pear should be ripe, but not too soft or it will become mushy in salad.

NEW YEAR'S; THE PARTY AFTER THE NIGHT BEFORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CARROLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the hubbub of New Year's Eve, New Year's Day is refreshingly quiet. 
Everyone's a little tired, but friends and family drop by and the atmosphere is 
still holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago I hit upon a hair-of-the-dog party menu that was a real 
success, both for the cook and the company. A warm, spicy, nonalcoholic drink 
to serve by the fire, crunchy bruschetta (toast topped with ricotta and roasted 
sweet red peppers) and a platter of vegetarian fajitas with two salsas. 
</P>
<P>
 The charm of the menu is twofold. By Jan. 1, many party-goers crave 
simplicity. This menu is essentially made of fresh vegetables, great breads and 
interesting spices. No elaborate sauces or finicky arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, it's more than self-service, it's make-your-own. People really enjoy 
rolling their own fajitas, choosing the fiery or the mild salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can make this punch several days ahead of time, refrigerate it in a large 
jug, then reheat it as needed. For the party, I bring it to a boil, transfer it 
to a slow-cooker set on low and replenish supplies as needed.  
</P>
<P>
 CRAN-APPLE AND MAPLE NOG 
</P>
<P>
 1 quart apple cider 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups fresh orange juice 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2 cinnamon sticks 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup real maple syrup 
</P>
<P>
 1 quart lemonade 
</P>
<P>
 1 (6-ounce) can frozen undiluted cranberry juice, thawed 
</P>
<P>
 1 lemon 
</P>
<P>
 10 whole cloves 
</P>
<P>
 Place cider, orange juice, cinnamon sticks, maple syrup, lemonade and 
undiluted cranberry juice in large soup pot and set over medium heat. Halve 
lemon and stick cut ends with cloves. Add to cider. Cover and simmer 1 hour. 
Adjust sweetness to taste by adding more maple syrup if needed. Serve warm. 
Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Variation: Remove lemons before transferring punch to slow-cooker. Float 
slices of 2 unpeeled seedless oranges and 1 unpeeled green apple on top. Set 1 
mug of whole cinnamon sticks alongside as beverage stirrers. BRUSCHETTA WITH 
RICOTTA AND ROASTED SWEET RED PEPPERS 
</P>
<P>
 8 (3/4-inch-thick) slices crusty French bread 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup light ricotta cheese 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons fat-free mayonnaise 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons nonfat yogurt 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup bottled roasted sweet red peppers, drained and divided into 8 portions 
</P>
<P>
 Toasted bread 
</P>
<P>
 Combine ricotta, mayonnaise, yogurt and cheese in blender container and 
process until smooth. Spread on toasted bread. Top each slice with 1 piece of 
sweet red pepper. Set on platter and cover with plastic wrap until serving 
time.

WESTSIDE WATCH: SPECTACULAR SUNSETS ADD EVEN MORE HOLIDAY COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bright lights and colorful displays may mark the season, but the real show, 
according to meteorologists and beach strollers, has been the recent series of 
dazzling, kaleidoscopic sunsets of green, pink, orange, red and yellow hues. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists say the gorgeous twilight scenes occur most frequently in the 
winter when Santa Ana winds push low-level moisture offshore. Light from the 
setting sun refracts through the dewy air, scattering bits of color throughout 
the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Air pollution is also blown offshore, which can also make for some good 
aesthetics," said Clay Morgan, a meteorologist with the National Weather 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Also contributing to the sparkling dusks: the 1992 volcanic eruption of Mount 
Pinatubo, which left dust and debris in the stratosphere, and clouds 25,000 
feet high that remain bright long after sundown, thanks to the dry offshore 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ocean beneath, Morgan said, such sunsets cannot be beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "A sunset over the Midwest is just not comparable to these spectacular sunsets 
over the Pacific," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 GOING WITH THE FLOW: Over the years, the Bodywork Emporium, a Santa Monica 
retailer of massage therapy equipment, has received more than a few offbeat 
requests for massage tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Some clients want to know if the contraptions can hold horses or are suitable 
for dog and pet massage. One channeler preferred a wood frame table with a 
"freer energy flow" rather than one made of aluminum. Others put the tables to 
uses including weightlifting, yoga, hands-on healing -- even displaying 
crystals at new-age health conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the Emporium's Margi 
</P>
<P>
 Cicci: "People walk by and think they can use them for anything. We've had 
several homeless people buy them as beds." 
</P>
<P>
 ALREADY RUNNING: Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks -- who has not 
yet conceded the race she ran this year against Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling 
Hills) -- says she plans to run again for the congressional seat in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks could have a few challengers for the Republican nomination in the 36th 
District, which hugs the coast from San Pedro to Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes psychiatrist Irwin Savodnik said that he will decide 
within a month whether he will run. Savodnik spent more than $50,000 of his own 
money in this year's Republican primary but was forced to drop out because he 
had switched his party affiliation too late to qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a very serious race next time," Savodnik said. "We're going 
to put a lot of money in the campaign and we're going to raise a lot of money." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential contender is Los Angeles developer John Morris, who made an 
unsuccessful bid for state controller this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people thought Jane Harman was invincible," Morris said. "They saw how 
well Susan did and said, 'Gee, (Harman) can be knocked off.' It should have 
been a Republican seat, and with a good candidate, it will be a Republican 
seat."

STATE IS CLOSELY MONITORING FINANCES AT SANTA MONICA COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State officials are keeping a close watch on the finances of Santa Monica 
College, where budget reserves have dipped to $130,000 from about $3 million in 
1991, the college's acting president said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The declining reserves, caused by a dip in property tax revenues, lower 
enrollment and salary increases for teachers of foreign students, could prompt 
state community college officials to appoint a fiscal administrator if the 
college cannot meet payroll or cover expenses, acting President Tom Donner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Donner expressed confidence that the college's finances will not 
deteriorate to that point. He said the Santa Monica Community College District 
will control costs and benefit from the upturn in the state's economy, which is 
expected to bring more state property tax money to community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident the state will fill in the property tax shortfall," he said. 
"The (district) budget committee will make adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle Orr, spokesman for the chancellor of California Community Colleges, said 
the Santa Monica Community College District is in a "Priority 2" status, 
meaning it has "demonstrated characteristics that in our judgment require a 
greater degree of involvement to ensure (its) well-being." He said the finances 
of Priority 2 districts -- currently there are four in California -- are 
closely monitored by the chancellor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials recommend that community colleges keep 3% of their operating 
budgets in reserve. That amounts to $1.65 million for Santa Monica College, 
which has a $55-million operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But in budget sessions during the last three years, Donner said, the district 
decided to dip into the reserves instead of cutting school services, out of 
concern that austerity steps would worsen the school's enrollment declines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It boiled down to a decision by the district, whether to reduce services or 
reserves," he said. "If we start losing programs, we start losing students. 
That would be devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 The state chancellor's office calculates how much funding a college campus 
receives based on enrollment and property taxes. The state places a cap on 
enrollment funding, so once the cap is surpassed the district has to cover the 
cost of enrolling extra students. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to generate more funds, said Donner, the college aggressively 
recruited foreign students and now has the largest non-resident enrollment -- 
2,300 -- of any two-year college in the nation. The fees from non-residents 
have helped the college's financial situation, Donner said. But those funds, he 
said, were used to give the teachers of foreign students much-needed salary 
increases.

LALA LAND; ANGELENOS WILL GET A CHANCE TO SAMPLE A SLICE OF LOUISIANA AT 
CULTURAL FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It may be the holidays, but the Louisiana to Los Angeles (LALA) Organizing 
Committee is already looking ahead to February and another winter season of bon 
temps -- good times. 
</P>
<P>
 With Mardi Gras in mind, the committee kicked off a campaign last week at 
Fifth Street Dick's to promote the annual Louisiana culture festival to be held 
Feb. 18 and 19 in Leimert Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Parading down 43rd Place, blowing police whistles and waving fur-trimmed 
parasols, about 50 committee members and curious onlookers got a taste of 
things to come as they joined together in a spirited "second line," the 
unofficial party dance of old New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to do a series of events this year leading up to the festival," 
committee member Fred Thomas explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said second-line troupes and accompanying bands plan to travel the 
Southland to raise awareness about the upcoming festival, now in its seventh 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 Between the live Dixieland jazz music and dancing, the committee unveiled the 
official graphic by local artist Avery Clayton that will advertise the 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton, best known for his ink renderings of black historical figures, said 
he merged Los Angeles and Louisiana for the project, done in watercolor: A jazz 
band marches down a street past a New Orleans-style frame house, palm trees 
jutting overhead and the Hollywood Hills -- decorated with a "Baldwin Hills" 
sign -- in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 A banner held aloft by marchers proclaims "Laissez le Bontemps Roulez" ("Let 
the Good Times Roll"). 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to combine the best elements of both places," said Clayton, 
who was commissioned to do murals for the 1984 Summer Olympics.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said the next LALA festival will be one of firsts: the first to span 
two days instead of one and the first to feature a "walk of fame" that pays 
tribute to the community people who helped found the festival and keep it 
going.

STATE ASSAILS BEVERLY HILLS ON HOUSING; GOVERNMENT: THE CITY IS ACCUSED OF 
FAILING TO PRODUCE A PLAN TO PROVIDE LOW-INCOME DWELLINGS. BUT ITS LEADERS 
INSIST THAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE EVEN IF STRICT COMPLIANCE IS LACKING.

 Low-income housing in Beverly Hills? 
</P>
<P>
 The concept may sound strange, but state law requires Beverly Hills to file 
plans to provide its fair share of Los Angeles County's housing -- low-income 
included. And for nearly 10 years, state officials say, the city has failed to 
comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Every five years, each California city must file a plan, called a housing 
element, with the state, illustrating how it will provide a predetermined 
number of housing units. But state officials say Beverly Hills has not filed a 
satisfactory housing element since 1979. The next one came due in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, prodded by a warning letter from the state attorney general's 
office, Beverly Hills filed a draft housing plan with the state Department of 
Housing and Community Development. But housing officials said the plan fails to 
meet state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials had determined that Beverly Hills' fair share of affordable 
housing should be 835 units, a third of which should be designated low-income. 
Although they did not know exactly how many affordable housing units are 
already in the city, state officials said the number falls well short of 835. 
</P>
<P>
 In a six-page letter sent last month to Beverly Hills City Manager Mark Scott, 
the state housing department said the city's plan lacks adequate provisions for 
affordable housing. Further, the letter said, Beverly Hills did not invite 
representatives of low-income groups to help draft the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are one of the worst cities in the state of California (in complying 
with housing laws)," said Carolyn Badenhausen, the department's acting deputy 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beverly Hills officials argue that the city has made strides in providing 
housing despite its lack of strict compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's important to focus on why we didn't do something; what 
we've been doing in the meantime is more important," said Ruth Nadel, the 
city's director of planning and community development. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills has been creating programs to help reduce housing costs for 
low-income residents, Nadel said. For example, she said, the city since 1989 
has matched 61 people, most of them elderly, with roommates to save on rent. 
And it has contracted with handymen to provide 156 residents with up to $2,000 
worth of minor home repairs each, free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the city built 150 units of affordable housing on Crescent Avenue, 
Nadel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, none of these efforts have brought Beverly Hills into compliance with 
state housing law, and the city risks having the attorney general bring the 
matter to court -- an option the state has not yet pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the attorney general has written letters to the cities, including 
Beverly Hills, that are out of compliance, notifying them that their housing 
elements were inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since those letters were sent, compliance statewide has risen from 19% of 
cities in 1991 to 52% today, Badenhausen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills' first priority in complying with the law should be to rezone 
some areas to allow for multifamily housing development, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nadel contends that multifamily housing units covering all income levels 
already dominate the housing market in Beverly Hills. She said city officials 
have been able to provide affordable housing in a city known for its wealth -- 
even without a housing plan that complies with state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't feasible to try and accomplish all of what (the state) requires," 
Nadel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Badenhausen, however, maintains that there are other steps the city could 
take, such as providing subsidies for builders and landlords to develop 
affordable units and to rehabilitate older buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills' housing element also fails to detail how the city will use 
federal and state tax-credit funds to encourage developers to build low-income 
housing, state officials say. In addition, the plan does not identify sites 
where emergency shelters and transitional housing could be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step for Beverly Hills is to come up with a new housing element and 
submit it to the City Council for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city and state both sign off on the plan, Beverly Hills will be in 
compliance. There is no deadline for the city to complete this process, 
Badenhausen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica also has a housing plan that is not in compliance with state law. 
But unlike Beverly Hills, she said, Santa Monica has been attempting to comply 
by regularly filing housing elements. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing element filed by Santa Monica officials in 1993 has prompted a 
lawsuit by two nonprofit groups -- the Santa Monica Housing Council and the 
California Housing Council -- and a Santa Monica resident. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit charges that Santa Monica is not trying to live up to housing goals 
set by the Southern California Assn. of Governments but rather has devised a 
housing plan with different goals. The case is scheduled for a hearing in Los 
Angeles Superior Court in May, said Chris Harding, an attorney with Lawrence & 
Harding, which is representing the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the California Supreme Court is considering a request by the 
city of Santa Monica to intervene in the case before it goes to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu is also not in compliance with housing law, but the state granted it an 
extension until next year to file a plan because Malibu is newly incorporated.

HANGOUTS; THE KOSHER, BOHEMIAN WAY TO SCHMOOZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The energy was high. The appreciative audience roared with approval, swaying 
to the upbeat tunes from Providence -- the band, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's long-haired male guitarist, sporting a yarmulke and payes (long, 
uncut sideburns) that are hallmarks of Orthodox Jews, sang spiritual messages 
to a hip mix of Sephardic Moroccan rhythms and rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't your run-of-the-mill Saturday night concert at a smoke- and 
booze-filled nightclub. Instead, it was a lively quasi-religious performance at 
one of Melrose Avenue's newest and perhaps most unlikely nightspots. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Shmooze, half a block from the Groundlings Theater and diagonally across 
the street from Spike's Joint West, is a one-of-a-kind kosher Jewish hangout 
that opened in early November in the former 56 West nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday nights, the 2,800-square-foot facility functions as an 
alcohol-free club and coffeehouse, as on this recent evening the draw was Rabbi 
Daveed el Harar, a teacher of mysticism at Etz Jacob Congregation Annex in Los 
Angeles, who plays what he calls "redemption tunes." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unique in L.A.," said David Saelman of Westwood, who was at the concert. 
"It's kind of like a bohemian Jewish experience." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cafe Shmooze is more than just a club. It is a multipurpose Jewish center 
for families and singles, with myriad activities, including weekend retreats, 
singles events and lectures on contemporary issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a need in the Jewish community," said founder Rabbi Chaim Dalfin, 
explaining why he started the cafe. "We're trying to expose Judaism to Jews in 
a way that's not threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a negative aura that's associated with organized religion. People 
have this notion that synagogue life is centered around dues and money." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "The other fear is that religion is very restrictive and 
old-fashioned and that it doesn't deal with the contemporary world." Dalfin is 
a Brooklyn native who came to Los Angeles nearly three years ago. He is a 
former director of Chabad of Marin County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've created a place in which we can bring together the best of the two 
worlds. One is the world of Judaism, and the other is the world of 
entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday nights and Saturday mornings, the facility serves as a synagogue, 
with Shabbat services offered. Dalfin said his services incorporate a mystical 
focus in addition to lots of singing and explanations. 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe also houses a children's playroom and a Jewish library and can be 
rented for Jewish celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 And the center welcomes Jewish humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote a soap opera. It's called 'All My Children Don't Call Me Anymore,' " 
said emcee and entertainment director Reuvane Russell during a brief comedy 
routine before introducing Providence. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his skit, Russell read some quirky personal ads he created. Among 
them: "OJM (Orthodox Jewish male) seeks nice Jewish girl. OJF seeks nice Jewish 
boy. O.J. Simpson seeks nice alibi." 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Shmooze opened on July 4, 1993, in an 800-square-foot space at 7466 
Beverly Blvd. Programs featured singer-songwriter Peter Himmelman, the band 
Rebbe Soul, comedian Zalman Rosenblum, and Robert Avrech, co-producer of "A 
Stranger Among Us." Lecture topics ranged from homeopathy to dating to 
self-improvement via Chassidism. 
</P>
<P>
 During the opening weekend on Melrose in early November, entertainment 
included a concert with composer and recording artist Sam Glaser, who has been 
director and producer of the American Jewish Song Festival for the last three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new space is definitely more upscale and a little bit more on the 
cosmopolitan side," Glaser said. "I like playing there because people go there 
to really listen and have a Jewish experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cafe Shmooze attracts many Orthodox Jews, Dalfin says that word has 
gotten out to the mainstream as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very warm and cozy here," said Cafe Shmooze first-timer Terri Levin, a 
legal secretary from Park La Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Mann, an investor from Park La Brea, agreed. "It's a neat place. It has 
potential to bring different groups of people together." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday and Saturday, Cafe Shmooze is scheduled to hold a weekend seminar, 
"All You Wanted to Know From a Chassidic Scientist," led by Yaacov Brawer, a 
teacher of Chassidic philosophy and professor of anatomy, obstetrics and 
gynecology at McGill University School of Medicine in Montreal. The program 
will culminate with an informal New Year's Eve gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Shmooze is located upstairs at 7270 1/2 Melrose Ave. (the sign says 
Jewish Enrichment Center). Open most nights with various hours, and Sundays 
from 1 to 7 p.m. Cover is $6 on Saturday nights; admission varies on other 
nights. For information about upcoming programs, call (213) 954-1770.

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; UP AGAINST THE WALL; RENTERS' GROUP REVOLUTIONIZED 
SANTA MONICA POLITICS IN THE '70S, BUT NOW IT MUST FIGHT FOR POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 IN THE RAINY PRE-DAWN HOURS, while the rest of Santa Monica slept, the party 
faithful assembled, as they always do. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mayors Denny Zane and Jim Conn were there, as they have been from the 
beginning, along with Nancy Greenstein and Bruce Cameron, current mainstays of 
the group. They were joined by a contingent of newcomers on their first 4 a.m. 
foray onto the damp streets of the beach city. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion was Election Day '94. For 15 years, stalwart members of Santa 
Monicans for Renters Rights (SMRR) have trolled the streets of Santa Monica on 
Election Day in search of votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 8 was no exception. Trudging through renter neighborhoods, volunteers 
hung campaign flyers on voters' doors. The goal was to get in the last 
political word by reminding renters where their interests lie: in protecting 
what is arguably the country's toughest rent control law. 
</P>
<P>
 That message would seem an easy sell in Santa Monica, where 72% of residents 
are renters. But for the long-dominant renters' organization, controlling the 
city politic has never been an easy task -- and it is getting less so. After so 
many years, some tenants, it seems, have come to take rent control for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the same for the SMRR hierarchy, either. While loyalties remain, the 
energy of the old days, of participating in a political vanguard, is getting 
harder and harder to replicate. 
</P>
<P>
 The changing political tide made itself felt in last month's elections, which 
left the SMRR forces shaken, though still in control of the council by a 4-3 
margin. With the defeat of SMRR-endorsed incumbent Tony Vazquez, the group 
found out just how much public safety defines local politics today. Vazquez, 
whom the group had envisioned as a bright new leader, was beaten by a political 
unknown running on a law-and-order slate. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss came despite the SMRR campaign's own emphasis on public safety, along 
with its standard refrain about the need to protect rent control. 
</P>
<P>
 A major reason for SMRR's bad fortunes has been the Northridge earthquake, 
which left in doubt the future of more than 1,000 damaged -- and now empty -- 
rental units, many of which had been home to SMRR loyalists. The temblor also 
made it likely that rents for hundreds of other apartments will be raised to 
pay for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, a key feature of Santa Monica's rent control law -- that rents cannot 
rise to market levels when a unit is vacated -- is likely to be gutted by the 
state Legislature this year or next, due to the loss of key legislators who 
protected it. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this could cut into SMRR's political base by shrinking the number of 
residents living in low-rent apartments. Tenants paying market rent have no 
compelling economic reason to ally themselves with an organization whose main 
mission is to defend cut-rate rents. 
</P>
<P>
 SMRR's most serious problem, however, may well lie within. Internal 
disagreements over development, public safety and policies on the homeless -- 
stem in part from a clash of '60s values with '90s realities. Also, members' 
individual political agendas sometimes clash with larger principles and group 
loyalty, causing further dissension. A case in point: the recent battle between 
Councilmen Paul Rosenstein and Ken Genser over the mayorship. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, many suggest, is that SMRR is simply petering out, a prospect that 
has for the first time prompted key activists to publicly recommend a major 
overhaul of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen years is a long time for a single-issue organization to survive, so 
we've already beat the odds on that score," said Brad Jones, who recently 
resigned after five years as SMRR co-chair, a major loss, group members say, 
because of his role in holding disparate factions together. "In order for SMRR 
to continue, we have to redefine, and broaden, our focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Michael Tarbet, an SMRR founding member and attorney who ran the group's 
fall campaign: The election was "a message, and the message is we have to get 
busy. Or we can continue to do nothing for two years and see what happens -- 
and it's not going to be good." 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the future of a grass-roots movement that won national attention 
soon after it emerged in the late 1970s. It gained support from former '60s 
campus radicals who remained in the area after working in Tom Hayden's 1976 
campaign for the U.S. Senate, which failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny Zane, for example, was working for the local chapter of Hayden's 
controversial political organization, the Campaign for Economic Democracy 
(CED), which advocated redistribution of the nation's wealth and other radical 
causes. In 1978, a group of seniors asked for CED's help in their effort to 
pass a rent control law. 
</P>
<P>
 They were afraid Santa Monica was about to turn into Beverly Hills by the Sea. 
The sleepy beach city had been "discovered." Rents were skyrocketing and 
"condo-mania" -- the rush to evict tenants, tear down apartment houses and put 
up condominiums -- was rampant. 
</P>
<P>
 Zane said Hayden was initially reluctant to have his people work on the 
rent-control issue because it would drain resources from one of the group's 
main missions -- solar energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Zane and Parke Skelton, now a well-known political consultant, lent a 
hand to the seniors in the last six weeks of what turned out to be a losing 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a memorable election in that Proposition 13 was on the same ballot. 
Although the tax-cutting measure passed, rents did not go down as property 
taxes fell, leading Zane and others to argue for resubmitting a modified 
version of rent control to voters in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 The young public interest lawyer who drafted the law, Robert M. Myers, 
reworked it; CED members used their campaign sophistication to set up a 
door-to-door fund-raising operation, and a coalition of groups favoring rent 
control was formed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was called Santa Monicans for Renters Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, rent control won easily, but in many ways the struggle had just 
begun. Dolores Press, who served on the City Council and the Rent Board, 
recalls the volatile but exhilarating early days of rent control, when critics 
dubbed the city "The People's Republic of Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were under constant attack," Press said. City officials "had police dogs 
at Rent Board meetings" to keep the peace as angry landlords clashed with 
tenants and fought the board's new power over their property. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For those who took part, the intensity of the struggle is unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like you had all shared some magnificent experience that would happen 
once in a lifetime," Press said. "In a very short while it (became) anecdotal 
stories told over a few drinks." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Ruth Yannatta Goldway was elected to the council and became SMRR's 
most vocal and visible symbol. Her husband, economist Derek Shearer, was also 
allied with the rent-control campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 With Hayden and then-wife Jane Fonda, Goldway and Shearer were featured in the 
national media as having fomented a revolution -- the start of a nationwide 
progressive movement in local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Zane, Press, Conn and the late Ken Edwards were swept into 
office in a SMRR landslide, and Goldway was elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, however, SMRR's less liberal opponents, basically a loosely knit 
group of several other political factions in town, figured out how to make 
inroads: They embraced rent control as a law they would uphold and Goldway was 
trounced as The All Santa Monica Coalition won three seats. SMRR blamed the 
defeat of the outspoken Goldway on their lack of sufficient attention to 
campaigning because so many SMRR leaders were busy running the city. Their 
consultant, Skelton, saw the problem as a failure to make a strong enough link 
between the SMRR ticket and the need to protect rent control. 
</P>
<P>
 It was to be a defining moment for SMRR, which soon thereafter became a direct 
membership organization, rather than a coalition of groups, that ranged from 
the CED to a seniors' organization. The loss also begat what was SMRR's master 
political stroke: getting local elections changed from the spring to the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, local elections were held in April, when fewer, and more 
conservative, people tend to vote. The SMRR forces quietly worked to move local 
elections to November to coincide with the gubernatorial and presidential 
races, which traditionally bring more Democrats to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Having local elections in November was one of many things that seemed to make 
the group indomitable. Among other key elements of the group's past success: 
</P>
<P>
 * SMRR had a built-in voter base and a bread-and-butter issue that is a 
political consultant's dream come true. Making up 80% of the city's population 
in 1980 (the figure is now 72%), renters provided a rich pool of potential 
voters. SMRR had only to circulate campaign literature saying rent control was 
endangered to prevail at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 * SMRR had -- and still has -- economic viability, built by an ongoing 
canvassing of renters for contributions. Paid fund-raisers gather contributions 
from scores of tenants. Moreover, the group has maintained a base of 5,000 
dues-paying members. 
</P>
<P>
 * SMRR expanded its clout by becoming indispensable in electing Democrats to 
the state Legislature and U.S. House in districts that include Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Things began turning sour for the group in the late '80s, first over 
development questions and later over homeless and public safety issues. SMRR 
co-chair Nancy Greenstein said the group's one person-one vote nominating 
conventions left it vulnerable to those with a single-issue agenda, such as 
slow growth. It was easy to join the organization, pack the sparsely attended 
conventions and nominate candidates who have greater allegiances to them than 
to the group. 
</P>
<P>
 But it took at least half a dozen years for the organization's wear-and-tear 
to become evident, in part because the opposition forces were in disarray. 
Opinion is divided over whether the internal wrangling is any different now 
than in the early days, but most of the group's pioneers say the disputes have 
become more public. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were probably just as many disagreements, but a whole lot more 
respect," Press said. "Part of the loss of public confidence in SMRR has to do 
with (SMRR-elected council members') attacks on each other in the newspapers 
and at public meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 In one such instance, SMRR-backed council members who are renters made snide 
public comments about SMRR-backed council members who are homeowners, saying 
they couldn't possibly be as vigorous in their defense of rent control. 
</P>
<P>
 Press complains that the group's "lofty purpose" has also become obscured by 
politicians' egos. Said Press: "I grow weary of egos." 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent clash, Genser refused to go along with his three SMRR 
allies on the council to elect Rosenstein as mayor because he wanted to be 
mayor himself. (Rosenstein and Councilwoman Judy Abdo, for their part, wouldn't 
vote for Genser.) Genser and Rosenstein's differences stem from disputes over 
development policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts at intervention by the group's steering committee failed and 
Rosenstein made a deal with his political opponents to get the vote he needed 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenstein maintains that SMRR has become too insular and needs to focus its 
energy on the community at large to get ready for the day when rent control may 
not be the group's defining issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "A preoccupation with internal problems has prevented SMRR from being as 
meaningful as it could be to the wider community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, on the other hand, said the group's current problem comes from its 
willingness to discard -- or downplay -- the progressive values of the old days 
in order to win elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than concern with a vision . . . (SMRR) is concerned with holding onto 
power, no matter how it's exercised," said Myers, Santa Monica's former city 
attorney. "Why would anyone want an organization like this running the city?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A third opinion, that of Abdo, is that the group has suffered because key 
members have simply moved on. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have lived here a long time have become secure and stable in their 
homes or are having families and are not focused on the details" of SMRR, Abdo 
said. "A lot of our core people . . . are not active volunteers because their 
lives have changed." 
</P>
<P>
 SMRR's agenda, Abdo and others say, has always embraced more than rent 
control. They want people to know the role SMRR-elected public officials played 
in rebuilding the Santa Monica Municipal Pier, developing the Third Street 
Promenade and voting for the expansion of the Police Department. They also note 
with pride the city's sound financial position. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet SMRR is better known lately as the group that allowed homeless people 
to overrun the city's public places and resisted efforts to resolve the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The reputation has stuck, despite two years in which the majority of 
SMRR-backed council members supported a public safety-minded bipartisan effort 
to toughen the city's policies on the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The election results last month have prompted a lot of soul-searching within 
SMRR. The money for SMRR to wage a campaign was there, but despite a group of 
new volunteers recruited, the grass-roots effort fell far short of past 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the early days, there was all this energy, enthusiasm and spirit," Tarbet 
said. "We covered the city three times. . . . This time we didn't cover the 
city once walking precincts." 
</P>
<P>
 There is talk, not for the first time, of broadening the group's appeal by 
changing its name to Santa Monicans for Renters and Residents Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to reach out to more homeowners," Tarbet said.  
</P>
<P>
 While SMRR ponders its future, the group's political foes, now organized as 
Citizens for a Safe Santa Monica, wait. Flush from a strong showing at the 
polls and better organized than they have been in half a dozen years, the group 
sees a chance to wrest control of the council from SMRR in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 SMRR loyalists, however, say it won't be so. "SMRR has already had nine 
lives," Press said. "I think it will carry on." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) The Players 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at some of the past leaders of Santa Monicans for Renters 
Rights: 
</P>
<P>
 DENNIS ZANE: After 12 years, sometimes working full-time as a council member, 
mayor and SMRR leader, Zane reluctantly retired in 1992. He now heads a 
nonprofit environmental group, the Coalition for Clean Air, and lives with his 
wife in a rent-controlled apartment in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 PARKE SKELTON: Founding member Skelton's winning campaign strategy for SMRR 
provided him with the credibility needed to become a major political 
consultant. In recent years, he has run winning efforts for, among others, 
state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky and 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. He still coordinates SMRR's campaign mail for a 
fraction of his usual fee. 
</P>
<P>
 DEREK SHEARER: Forced off the Santa Monica Planning Commission after he and 
his wife, then-Mayor Ruth Yannatta Goldway, accepted free airplane tickets to 
London as part of an airline promotion, Shearer toiled as an Occidental College 
professor until Bill Clinton's run for President. Shearer worked to elect 
Clinton, a longtime friend, amid talk that he would be rewarded with a Cabinet 
post. It didn't happen (some speculated Shearer's liberal writings on economics 
would have led to a confirmation fight). After quitting his first 
Administration job in the Commerce Department, Shearer was named ambassador to 
Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 RUTH YANNATTA GOLDWAY: After failing to win a second term on the City Council 
in 1983, Goldway went to work for a large medical corporation and later took a 
public relations job at the Getty Museum, which she gave up to move to Finland 
with Shearer. She made the news twice in recent years -- by playing a Cabinet 
member in the film "Dave" and by receiving a sickbed visit from Hillary Clinton 
after undergoing surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 TOM HAYDEN: Hayden benefited greatly from his relationship with SMRR, which 
helped him win repeated terms in the state Assembly, where he was a key 
defender of rent control. In his tight race to move up to the state Senate, 
SMRR voters also helped provide him with an edge. Hayden still drops in at SMRR 
conventions, and ruffled some feathers this year when, without consulting his 
allies, he vehemently opposed a plan to develop the Civic Center.  
</P>
<P>
 DAVID FINKEL: A former member of the Rent Board and City Council, Finkel won a 
contested election in 1990 to become a Santa Monica municipal judge. His wife, 
artist Bruria Finkel, lost a bid last month to become a Santa Monica 
councilwoman, although she had the backing of SMRR. 
</P>
<P>
 JAMES CONN: The former councilman and mayor is a renter in the Ocean Park 
district whose landlord is one of the most outspoken critics of rent control. 
Conn is the pastor at The Church in Ocean Park, where, he said, he frets about 
SMRR's future but leaves it up to those who followed him to either rejuvenate 
the group or let it die. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL TARBET: A homeowner and tenants' attorney, Tarbet was SMRR's paid 
campaign manager this fall. He was also instrumental last year in fighting a 
measure in the state Legislature to weaken rent control, although he is less 
optimistic about the prospects to repeat that success because of changes in the 
legislative body. 
</P>
<P>
 DOLORES PRESS: Press failed to get enough valid signatures for her City 
Council reelection bid in 1983, but ran anyway as a write-in candidate, 
garnering about 13,000 votes. Though getting that many people to write in her 
name was an impressive achievement, it was not quite enough to win. Press went 
on to serve on the Rent Board and recently was reappointed to the city's 
Commission on the Status of Women, of which she was a founding member. Press 
said her key interest now is electing more women to office.

OUT AND ABOUT / MALIBLUES: RING IN '95 WITH WILD KNIGHT ON THE SAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not the trendy Sunset Strip, but the music rocks and the view provides 
the perfect backdrop to ring in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 On New Year's Eve, Maliblues will have a special dinner menu that includes 
choices of soup or salad, entree and dessert.Later in the evening, patrons can 
work off those unwanted holiday calories by dancing to the music of the rock 
'n' roll blues band King Ernest and the Wild Knights.  
</P>
<P>
 The club will also serve free nonalcoholic drinks to designated drivers. For 
dinner and the show, admission is $40 per person. Reservations are required. 
</P>
<P>
 Maliblues, after many years as Carlos & Pepe's Mexican Restaurant on Pacific 
Coast Highway, opened two months ago. Situated on the sand of Malibu's Carbon 
Beach, the 8,500-square-foot restaurant and club was designed to provide 
quality music at a reasonable price -- cover charges range from $5 to $10, 
significantly lower than most Hollywood clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Using well-known performers such as James Armstrong and Jimmy Ripp, the club's 
owners, longtime Malibu residents Steve and Alana Karsh, hope to get more 
people out to listen to blues bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been able to bring national acts to a small venue," Steve Karsh said. 
"We want to make (the club) a venue that gives value and entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to different blues acts each weekend, there is an open mike night 
on Wednesdays, a disc jockey who spins tunes on Thursdays and a Brazilian show 
on Sunday evenings. Partying gets started around 10 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Maliblues, 22706 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu. New Year's Eve dinner begins 
at 7 p.m. Live music and dancing starts at 10 p.m. and continues until 2 a.m. 
Admission is $40. Information: (310) 456-1186.

PREJUDICE: ROLE OF HUMAN RELATIONS PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having worked for 27 years as a professional in the Anti-Defamation League of 
B'nai B'rith, I am fully aware of ADL's "World of Difference" program and those 
of the National Conference of Christians and Jews Human Relations Retreat. The 
latter also has a fine summer camp program where living together expands and 
helps cement understanding ("The Division Problem," Dec. 15). 
</P>
<P>
 Important as recognition of differences is, the key to solving "division" is 
making American democracy work. That calls for unity with diversity and 
"differences" merged for the common good. 
</P>
<P>
 As the nature of prejudice is complex, and clouds the vision of a world 
needing to live in peace to survive, any and all programs in this field of 
human relations education must educate, and stress, the importance of the 
promise proclaimed in our Constitution and Bill of Rights, and found in ADL's 
preamble: " . . . to secure justice and fair treatment to all citizens alike." 
</P>
<P>
 That the challenge remains is evident in all that's happening not only in our 
school system, but society and the world as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Pride in self and group are positives. But to create the power to light our 
way(s), we need to link together (and) recognize the commonality that serves 
self best.

ZONING: DEFEAT OF BARRINGTON PLAZA PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westsiders owe Los Angeles City Council members Marvin Braude and Laura Chick 
a tremendous debt of gratitude for their disapproval of the proposed plan 
amendment and zoning change requested by the owner of the Barrington Plaza 
Apartments. As a result, Los Angeles retains the integrity of its 
community-designed Westside Plan. Westsiders should also be very grateful to 
their neighbors in the Hillside Federation, the Brentwood Homeowners Assn., the 
Pacific Palisades Community Council, the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs Foundation 
and others who worked so hard to protect the community's plan by fighting the 
apartment project.

 Everyone I know thinks it is a shame that The Times failed to mention Jack 
Allen in the Dec. 15 story about the defeat of the 30-story Barrington Plaza 
project in the Los Angeles City Council. He was one of the five designated 
persons who spoke against the project. Everyone agrees that Mr. Allen, a 
retired city attorney and a member of the Pacific Palisades Community Council, 
played a very substantial role in stopping Mayor (Richard) Riordan's pet 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Allen's masterful three-minute presentation to the council did in the 
developer. He argued that as a matter of law the city could not approve the 
project, because the council could not make a finding required by the law that 
the streets and highways in the vicinity of the project could accommodate the 
added traffic from the project. In colorful graphics, he showed that based on 
the project (Environmental Impact Report), 16 of the 17 intersections on 
Wilshire and around the project failed during peak hours, and that prevented 
the council from making the required finding. 
</P>
<P>
 His presentation not only helped solidify Councilman Braude's side, it 
convinced the developer that if the council approved the project and Mr. Allen 
challenged the project in court as he had threatened to do, the developer would 
lose. As reported in The Times, the developer withdrew the project because of 
his fear of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 We in the Westside owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Allen, who on his own time 
and at his own expense helped save us from what would have been a disastrous 
project.

 FAMILIAR FACES 
</P>
<P>
 When Westchester agreed to play in the Las Vegas Holiday Prep Classic, Coach 
Ed Azzam expected the Comets to play some of the best teams from across the 
nation. Instead, Westchester played teams from its own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester beat Crossroads, 85-79, in overtime in the second round and lost 
to Inglewood, 66-57, in the third round. Had they beaten Inglewood, the Comets 
would have played Compton Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see the point in going to Las Vegas if we're going to play Crossroads 
and Inglewood," Azzam said. "We can do that in a tournament here." 
</P>
<P>
 Azzam would have preferred to play eventual tournament champion Oak Hill 
Academy of Mouth of Wilson, Va., even if it was a first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing to Inglewood, the Comets did play three games against 
non-Southern California schools. Two were decided in the final seconds. Danny 
Walker made a three-point shot to give the Comets a 77-76 win over Mt. Zion of 
Durham, N.C., and Jason Hart made a three-point shot to beat Green Valley of 
Henderson, Nev., 66-64. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets beat Day of Greensboro, N.C., 81-68, to finish fifth. RISING COMET 
II 
</P>
<P>
 Although the boys' basketball team has traditionally been a power, the 
Westchester girls are quietly gaining recognition in the City Section. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets improved to 3-4 with a 62-18 victory over L.A. Wilson on Tuesday in 
the Birmingham tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany Lewis, a 6-foot junior center, led the team with 16 points. She is 
averaging 15 points and 10 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is also an outstanding volleyball player and was named to the 
All-Western League team. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Coach Ann-Marie Powledge, Lewis is an honor student and has the 
talent to earn a basketball or volleyball scholarship. STAT WATCH 
</P>
<P>
 Several Westside prep football players had offensive performances that ranked 
among the best in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Cal-Hi Sports magazine, Westchester tight end Tony Griffin, who 
caught 15 scoring passes, finished in a tie for third in touchdown receptions. 
Culver City receiver Jasiri Rodell finished fifth with 13 touchdown receptions 
and 24th in receptions with 55 for 1,380 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills quarterback Chris Wallace passed for 2,284 yards to finish 16th 
in the state. FOOTBALL AWARDS II 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City receiver Jasiri Rodell was selected to the Cal-Hi Sports all-state 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-1, 185-pound senior was one of three receivers selected to the 
first-team offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Daylon McCutcheon of Bishop Amat was named the state player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local players honored were St. Monica quarterback Steven Pulley and 
defensive back Jason Jones, who were selected to the medium schools all-star 
team. RAVE REVIEW 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely does a player from a losing team earn the most valuable player award in 
a basketball tournament, but Israel Plaza of Fairfax accomplished that feat 
during the Matador Shootout in Bullhead, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Lions lost to Mountain View of Mesa, Ariz., 53-50, in the 
championship game, Plaza, who averaged 18 points a game in the tournament, was 
named MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a pretty classy thing for the tournament directors to do," 
Fairfax Coach Harvey Kitani said. PLAYER COACH 
</P>
<P>
 When he was a player last season, Danny Brummel helped guide his Pacific Hills 
teammates through the offense. Now, Brummel is doing his coaching from the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Brummel, a two-time All-Southern Section Division V player, is the Bruins' 
junior varsity coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny wanted to take a year off and gain a different perspective of the 
game," Pacific Hills varsity Coach John Bobich said. "I think he's a really, 
really good coach. I think the experience will only help him when he goes back 
to playing." 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior forward, Brummel led the Bruins to the Southern Section Division 
V-A title and to the State Division V finals. He turned down offers to play at 
Cal State Dominguez Hills, Redlands and other community college programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins varsity is 8-2 entering this week's games. Last week, Pacific Hills 
lost to Pacific, 52-41, in the championship game of the Aquinas tournament. One 
of the standout players is John Murray, the first freshman to be a full-time 
starter at the school. Murray is averaging eight points and seven rebounds a 
game. WHITE CHRISTMAS 
</P>
<P>
 When the Palisades girls' basketball team took the court Monday against La 
Salle of Pasadena in the Birmingham tournament, the Dolphins were missing 
standout center Lisa Shakiban. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2 Shakiban, who is averaging eight points and 10 rebounds a game, 
was snowed in at Big Bear after spending the weekend skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like my players skiing during the season," said Palisades Coach Joi 
Tanita, whose team managed to beat La Salle, 79-26. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakiban returned for Tuesday's game against North Hollywood and scored three 
points in a 69-59 loss. CRYING FOUL 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard Coach Lori Pawinski grew tired of hearing whistle sounds Dec. 20 
during the Vikings Santa Barbara tournament game against Morro Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Morro Bay handed St. Bernard its second consecutive loss, 48-46. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't win when you have 29 fouls," Pawinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (9-2) lost to Long Beach Poly, 54-45, on Dec. 6. They won four 
games in a row before losing a rematch, 46-38, against the Jackrabbits on 
Tuesday in the second round of the Gahr tournament. RECRUITING NEWS 
</P>
<P>
 Former Beverly Hills standout Greg Holmes received a partial scholarship to 
play baseball at Nevada. Holmes played center field last season at Harbor 
College, where he batted .328 with eight doubles, three triples, two home runs, 
18 runs batted in and 20 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes was a running back and defensive back for the Norman football team and 
played center field before he graduated in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He played one season at Santa Monica College before the school dropped its 
baseball program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former Westchester standout Jason Sanders is looking to transfer after 
quitting the San Diego State basketball team last month. According to 
Westchester Coach Ed Azzam, Sanders would like to play locally, but is not 
getting any offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think he can't play at UCLA or high Pacific 10 schools, but I think 
he's good enough to help some programs out," Azzam said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders said he would like to play for former San Diego State Coach Tony 
Fuller at Pepperdine, but the Waves already have a surplus of guards. SEAN

 PAPER THIN: The county bond crisis not only means cutbacks by local agencies, 
but in some cases a whack at their financial credibility. The Orange County 
Sanitation Districts headquarters in Fountain Valley lost its paper supplier -- 
the paper company feared it wouldn't get paid. . . . Even with a new supplier, 
sanitation officials say they'll cut back paper use to "only essential 
projects." They're sharing thick reports: no more individual copies. 
</P>
<P>
 BLUE BLAHS: County government may have its financial problems, but at least it 
doesn't have La Palma's woes -- clashing colors. . . . The city has completed a 
$500,000 renovation of its Central Park, but officials aren't completely happy. 
. . . Reason: The huge blue rubber pad under the playground equipment faded to 
an unsightly greenish-blue in the sun. "It looks terrible," says Councilman 
Duane F. Schuster. The city refuses to pay the $4,000 bill for the pad, but 
says it will have to live with the offbeat color. 
</P>
<P>
 BRINGING GLORY: The hot ticket this month at the Temple Bat Yahm in Newport 
Beach is for the Jan. 29 appearance of author Herman Wouk, whose latest book is 
"The Glory." If you haven't read any of his works, maybe you've seen one of the 
TV miniseries based on them ("Winds of War," "War and Remembrance.") . . . . 
Wouk, 79, rarely makes public appearances, preferring to spend his time in 
research -- he moved to Washington just to be close to the Library of Congress. 
Tickets are $20, $10 for full-time students. 
</P>
<P>
 FREE THREES: If you've forgotten that the cost of regular first class mail 
delivery goes up to 32 cents at the first of the New Year, the Postal Service 
will remind you -- by sending your mail back. . . . So what do you do with all 
those 29-cent stamps you haven't used? In Rancho Santa Margarita, Mail Boxes 
Etc., which rents out postal boxes and runs a mail service, has come up with a 
promotional gimmick: It's giving each customer 10 free 3-cent stamps. Any more, 
you pay for.

 RINGS, PLEASE: Charmaine Whalen was one wife too many. The Palmdale resident, 
24, became suspicious after husband Vernon Pierce failed to come meet her 
family after their April wedding, so she sent police to his Glendale, Ariz., 
home . . . where another of his four wives was knocking on his door.Now, 
ex-model Pierce, 29, is facing bigamy charges. Whalen (B7) won't be fooled 
again. She had dreamed of becoming a police officer. "Now I really want to do 
it."

 PICTURE PERFECT: It's been a topsy-turvy year in the San Fernando Valley, and 
it's all reviewed on pages B2 and B3 today. . . . "Images of 1994" include The 
Times Valley Edition's most memorable photos, from the triumphs of a Little 
League championship team to rebuilding quake-wracked freeways.

 HOLIDAZE: A break between Christmas and the New Year? Not if you observe 
Kwanzaa. The seven-day cultural celebration, which began Monday, draws 18 
million African descendants worldwide, including many participants in the 
Valley. Says Leslie Small, a Pan African studies professor at Cal State 
Northridge: "I think it's been catching on. There's this whole sense of 
cultural consciousness taking place among African Americans." Jeff Schnaufer

HOSPITAL CHAPLAINS DOCTOR TO THE SPIRITS OF PATIENTS, FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chaplain John Greenlee stood back from the trauma room at the Thousand Oaks 
hospital as memories of the deaths he had witnessed suddenly began to file by. 
</P>
<P>
 Men of 80 years, children of just a few -- all had taken their final breath 
under the harsh surgical light just paces away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see them," the chaplain at Los Robles Regional Medical Center said as 
if addressing himself, his voice thickening with emotion. "A 17-year-old girl. 
A woman on her knees praying beside her husband, saying, 'It can't be. It can't 
be.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Just as quickly, the ghosts vanished and Greenlee, a tall and cheery spirit, 
rejoined the living. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, we're nearly a full house today, aren't we?" he said to a crowded 
waiting room. Eleven people from two families had gathered while loved ones 
struggled for their lives in the intensive-care unit nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asked Greenlee what exactly it is he does as chaplain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never really known exactly how to explain it," he quipped. "They say, 
'Pray a lot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A ripple of laughter rolled across the room, relieving the ache and the 
tension. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place needs smiles," Greenlee said in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 While physicians attend to frailties of the body, Greenlee and a couple of 
dozen chaplains -- salaried and volunteer -- attend to injuries of the soul at 
hospitals throughout Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In wide hallways and small waiting rooms, behind emergency curtains and under 
hanging televisions, they work. They can use a humorous turn of phrase to 
brighten a fading life, a knack for small talk to quicken the drag of time, a 
good ear to defuse anger or anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 They seek not to win converts, but to ease passage -- either back into life or 
on to death, said Chaplain David Knapp of St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital 
in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The heroism, humanity and pain chaplains witness are typically far removed 
from the public eye. "The way that people let you into their lives, I feel like 
I'm walking on sacred ground," said Chaplain Christine Picchi, director of 
chaplains at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. "We receive as much 
as we give." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenlee, 65, who also serves as a minister at Westlake Community Christian 
Church, said, "You've got to love people or you can't do this thing. . . . Some 
(patients) won't let go of your hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses and doctors, the dying, the living, the disbelieving have all sought 
chaplains' comfort. Sometimes they even help save lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Kraye, 53, on her third day in the intensive-care waiting room at St. 
John's in Camarillo, credited Knapp with helping her 78-year-old mother battle 
back from a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me, she told the nurse, she told David she wanted to die," the 
Valencia resident said. "But with David's help, she was encouraged to fight it. 
She said, 'Lying here, I realize how much more I have to live for.' She's 
dramatically improved." 
</P>
<P>
 Traumatized by their injury or illness, some patients, particularly those in 
their closing years, can make ill-informed decisions about whether to prolong 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the role I play is to clarify the patient's wishes," Knapp said. 
"And sometimes that means helping, along with the physicians and the nurses, to 
see if the wishes of the patient are clouded by depression, or by pain." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited the case of another ailing woman who forbade hospital personnel to 
put her on a ventilator, saying she preferred to die instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Knapp helped dissuade her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very happy to be alive now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to move very carefully and cautiously," he added. "You don't want to 
violate the sacredness of a patient's wish, but you want to make sure those 
wishes aren't clouded by the patient's temporary mental state." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are members of health-care teams bent upon the preservation of 
life, chaplains also must be prepared to allay the guilt of fatally ill 
patients who are so miserable that they elect to die, Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job, then, is to let them know when it's OK," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Death, paradoxically, is another part of the life process, said Chaplain 
Donald Ham of Simi Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Knapp said, "the body is not what is sacred. It's the sense of 
beingness, the sense of personhood. . . . Jesus didn't put all of his focus on 
his fleshly existence. If that was the most important thing to him, he would 
have never been able to go to the cross." 
</P>
<P>
 Knapp, 43, a former minor-league baseball player who is an ordained United 
Methodist minister, darkened when he recalled an incident about two years ago. 
Bothered by a pain in his leg, a 6-year-old boy was brought by his mother to 
the hospital for tests. 
</P>
<P>
 He had leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ever so difficult, ever so sad," said Knapp, who sat with the mother 
and child while the doctor delivered his diagnosis. "I had nightmares with that 
child. I had very restless, sleepless nights for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with such meaningless suffering, chaplains can become victims, too, 
Greenlee said, their faith sometimes tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Ham remembered a trying day in which three lives passed before his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first case, the family of 14-year-old stabbing victim Chad Hubbard 
agonized in the waiting room at Simi Valley Hospital while Ham served as a 
liaison between them and the surgical team battling to save the boy's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Periodically, Ham would duck into the swirl of bodies in the emergency room to 
collect scraps of news -- little of it good -- that he could deliver to the 
anxious parents and their pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Chad died, his family had been somewhat prepared, Ham said. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, a 45-year-old man who suffered a heart attack while 
exercising died in the same emergency room, his wife nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a woman injured in a car accident was wheeled into the same room, where 
physicians vainly fought to revive her while her husband watched.  
</P>
<P>
 "What I try to do as soon as possible is take a break and take a good walk," 
said the 62-year-old Ham, soon to be an associate pastor at the Glendale 
Seventh-day Adventist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 But all he could do after this eight-hour odyssey through pain and loss was 
collapse in bed, drained both emotionally and spiritually. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this profession, you must distance yourself appropriately enough from the 
tragic situations for self-protection of your own psyche and your own 
well-being," said Knapp, who uses humor to help insulate himself. "If I 
(didn't), then I would be an absolute basket case. Anyone would, whether you 
were a nurse or a doctor or a radiology technician." 
</P>
<P>
 Picchi, 42, who directs Ventura County's only chaplain-education program, 
said: "Hospitals are stressful places for people to work in, because daily 
they're being exposed to people who are suffering or have sustained tragedy and 
loss. And so I think people who work in health care are vulnerable, too. And 
one of our goals as chaplains is to care for our staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Now in her 10th year as a supervisor at St. John's, Picchi oversees a staff of 
seven chaplains at the Oxnard hospital, four of them full-time and all but two 
of them women. The facility has a hospital chapel, as do the Camarillo, 
Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley hospitals, with daily services that can be 
broadcast to patients' rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Picchi's mother died when Picchi was a 15-year-old student in Burlingame, 
south of San Francisco. The event was pivotal in her decision to become a 
chaplain, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 So overwhelming was the support she received from the Sisters of Mercy -- who 
ran her Catholic high school -- "that I was very attracted to people who work 
in the health-care profession and who help others through difficult times of 
grief and loss," Picchi said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to giving sacrament to the dying and funeral assistance to the 
living, chaplains can float the options of donating organs or tissue, Picchi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of Michelle Glassman, a Moorpark College student killed in 
an accident on Sept. 22, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 65 people across the country gained from her death by receiving 
transplants of her tissues, bones and organs, said Paul Mathis, who at the time 
was a chaplain at Simi Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dealing with the family is always the hardest part. But it needs to be done," 
said Brenda Perry, a registered nurse at Los Robles who sometimes assists 
Greenlee and others in inquiring about the harvesting of organs. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned as much with the living as with the dying, Greenlee said he and 
others never coerce such decisions out of grieving survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they say no, you say, 'That's fine. We understand,' " Perry said in 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Roche, director of volunteer services at Los Robles, said Greenlee is 
particularly experienced with "catastrophic things" -- such as the horrors in 
the emergency room -- because he has been a volunteer chaplain with the Ventura 
County Fire Department for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the yawning door of the trauma room, Greenlee said, "When a patient dies, I 
encourage people to see their loved ones. There's a closure then." 
</P>
<P>
 Literally, he added, he sometimes holds the survivors up, to "let them have 
their last look. Then when it's time, you tell them. You say, 'It's time now.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Like coroner's examiners on doorsteps at midnight, chaplains are not always 
welcome. One elderly patient, seeing Greenlee appear in the doorway of his 
hospital room, brusquely challenged him: "Is it that bad?" 
</P>
<P>
 Greenlee said no. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never did care much for preachers," Greenlee recalled another man saying. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaplain shot back in jest: "You know, I never did like them that much, 
either. They're usually so stuffy." 
</P>
<P>
 The gruff man appreciated that, so Greenlee asked if he wanted to pray. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," the patient grumbled, "but not now." 
</P>
<P>
 While some dispirited patients might lash out at their god or even at the 
chaplain, Knapp does not take it personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a representative of faith, but I'm not the faith," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've found that one of the poorest things I can do is tell a patient, 'There, 
there now. You're not supposed to say that.' That negates their feelings. It 
negates their process. It's better to go with their process and allow it to run 
its course.

BANK HEISTS IN COUNTY DROP 50% IN 1994, FBI REPORTS; CRIME: THE YEAR'S 24 
ROBBERIES MARK THE LOWEST NUMBER SINCE COMPARISON OF SUCH STATISTICS BEGAN IN 
1986. FEWER LOCAL RESIDENTS ARE BELIEVED INVOLVED.

<P>
 Bank robberies in Ventura County dropped sharply in 1994, with robbers raiding 
the till only half as often as they did the previous year, the FBI reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbers held up 24 banks around Ventura County this year -- the lowest number 
since the FBI began comparing bank robbery statistics in 1986, FBI Agent Gary 
Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 With only two dozen robberies in 1994, Auer said, Ventura County banks were 
considerably quieter than in 1993, when 48 were robbed, and 1992, which had 
more than twice that number of stickups -- 97. 
</P>
<P>
 Extensive news coverage, vigilant tipsters, good investigators and tough 
punishment have dissuaded Ventura County residents from robbing banks as often 
as they once did, said Auer, who supervises the FBI's Ventura County office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County residents committed most of the robberies that occurred in 1993 
and 1992, Auer said. But the number dropped dramatically after the FBI and 
local police agencies arrested dozens of suspects, including 30 in 1992 alone, 
nearly all of whom lived in the Oxnard area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And bank robbers are receiving longer prison terms than in the past, averaging 
about five years for a single count, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these arrested in 1992 and 1993 got heavy sentences," he said. "The 
word got out, and we think this caused a major drop in the number of people 
from the Oxnard-Ventura area committing bank robberies." 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals and the news media have helped the FBI capture suspects, he said. 
One such man was Ronald Rene Bustamante, suspected of robbing three Ventura 
County banks in October and November, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 After local newspapers published bank surveillance photos of robbery suspects 
last month, telephone tips led agents to obtain a federal arrest warrant for 
Bustamante on Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 When police in San Diego arrested Bustamante on Dec. 22 on unrelated charges 
of attempted burglary, he was held on the federal bank robbery warrant and 
appeared Tuesday before a federal magistrate in San Diego, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only half of 1994's bank robberies in Ventura County have been solved, 
which is well below the average 77.8% arrest rate in robberies over the past 
nine years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Auer pointed out that some robberies are solved after the year in which 
they occurred, and he expects that 1995 arrests in 1994 cases will bring the 
arrest rate into line with previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our solution rate doesn't finish on Dec. 31," he said. "We continue looking 
into robberies. We expect to solve more this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Some busy robbers are still at large. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI dubbed one of the busiest the "Typed Note Bandit." 
</P>
<P>
 Agents believe that the man robbed the CalFed Bank on Moorpark Road in 
Thousand Oaks on May 2 and First Interstate Bank on the same street Aug. 8 -- 
as well as 20 other banks in the Los Angeles area since August, 1993 -- using 
only typewritten notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The notes used in the two Ventura County holdups generally say the same thing, 
Auer said. "They direct the teller to stay calm and follow directions, and they 
demand money." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI will not disclose the amount of money taken in each of the robberies, 
but Auer said the median haul was about $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is "Elmer Fudd," whom FBI agents nicknamed for the bulbous nose -- 
apparently fake -- that he wears during his robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI suspects that Fudd used a note to hold up the Wells Fargo Bank on 
Arneill Road in Camarillo on Christmas Eve, 1993, then went on to rob four more 
banks in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties in January and February, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 And four young men are still at large after taking over an American Savings 
Bank branch in Oxnard on Jan. 5 at gunpoint, cleaning out the money drawers and 
part of the safe and even robbing bank patrons, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents believe that the foursome came from Los Angeles County, but they have 
not been able to link the robbers to any other holdups in Ventura or Los 
Angeles counties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining Ventura County robberies all appear to be unconnected, the work 
of individual bandits who held up one bank apiece in Ventura County and never 
repeated the crime locally, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout 1994, some interesting patterns have emerged: The most-robbed 
institution in 1994 -- as in 1993 -- was Bank of America, which had nine 
robberies largely because it has more than two dozen branches in the county, 
Auer said. The next highest rate was at Wells Fargo branches, which were robbed 
four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America suffered a similar robbery rate in 1993, with 15 robberies 
compared with no more than six at other institutions in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular days of the week to rob banks have changed -- from Tuesday 
and Friday in 1993 to Wednesday in 1994, FBI statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our old tradition of the 'Friday night bank robbery' seems to have 
disappeared in Ventura County," Auer said, noting that Friday robberies 
declined from 23 in 1992 to 14 in 1993 and two this year -- only one of which 
was committed after noon on a Friday. Such heists were often committed by 
people who wanted money to buy drugs for the weekend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And there has been a marked decline in robberies of east Ventura County banks 
this year after a sharp increase last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank heists had increased in 1993 in the affluent east county, with more gang 
members from Los Angeles crossing the county line to commit holdups, the FBI 
said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But robberies of Conejo Valley banks dropped from 16 in 1993 to five in 1994, 
and Simi Valley robberies were halved, from six last year to three this year, 
the FBI report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard and Ventura led the county, with seven and six robberies, respectively. 
Camarillo, Fillmore and Port Hueneme had one each. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the pace of robberies countywide grew more sluggish as the year wore 
on, with fully one-third occurring in January and February. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Auer noted, robbers appear to be "getting to work earlier" this year. 
Fourteen of 1994's holdups occurred before 1 p.m., while in the past, robbers 
hit their targets more frequently in the afternoon, he said.

FIRM HOPES; CAMARILLO: OPENING OF RETAIL AND ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES MAY 
BETTER BALANCE THE CITY'S MAKEUP IN THE COMING YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Shopping and entertainment complexes set to open in 1995 may change the 
profile of Camarillo from that of a bedroom community to a more balanced city, 
better able to meet the needs of its growing population, city officials said in 
looking forward to the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Camarillo Factory Stores mall scheduled to open in the spring and 
talk of a mega-sized Target or K mart store being built on Las Posas Road near 
the Ventura Freeway, the city is poised to begin receiving as much as half a 
million more dollars annually from sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those facilities, along with two new major movie complexes (one built and the 
other under construction), mark a subtle change in the complexion of the city, 
whose burgeoning population outgrew its capacity to provide shopping and 
entertainment to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may have wanted to keep this a bedroom community, but the reality is that 
if we continue to grow, we will have to find new sources of income to support 
the needs of our residents," City Councilman Ken Gose said. "It is incumbent 
upon us to find as many stable new sources of revenues as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The city now receives about $3.6 million annually in sales tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no plans have yet been filed with the city regarding the super-sized 
K mart or Target store, the 22-acre Camarillo Factory Stores project is now 
past the halfway point in construction, developers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants for the 250,000-square-foot mall are expected to be announced next 
month, as are plans for a 160,000-square-foot second phase. The first phase 
should be open to shoppers by late spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to the mall site is an Edwards Theatres 12-screen cineplex that opened 
earlier this month. Edwards officials said at least one new restaurant will be 
built on an adjacent parcel to complement the $8-million theater complex. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mission Oaks area on the city's east side, an 11-screen United Artists 
complex has already broken ground and is expected to open by late summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is also expected to join with Oxnard to supply sewer and water 
systems for the Cal State University campus scheduled to be built northwest of 
Camarillo. Last week, landowners signed an agreement to sell 260 acres of 
farmland for the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In concert with efforts to promote projects that will generate sales tax 
dollars, city officials are working hard to recruit environment-friendly 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we're talking with anyone who is looking to relocate here, but we 
are trying to focus on bringing those high-tech, pollution-free companies to 
town," said James M. Jevens, the city's economic development consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Jevens said he is concentrating his recruiting on the biomedical and allied 
science fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a source of good, high-paying jobs for our residents and a good 
source of revenues for the city," Jevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the city looks to 1995 for new financial growth and stability, some 
of 1994's issues will remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing concerns about safety, as well as air and noise pollution, Councilwoman 
Charlotte Craven said the panel will continue to fight development of a 
regional airport at the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Although proponents of the airport hope to minimize flights over the city with 
use of a new, satellite-based navigation system, Craven says conversion of the 
naval facility to accommodate civilian travelers would drastically worsen the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a regional airport comes to fruition, it will change the entire character 
of the county within 20 years," she said. "Our agricultural and greenbelt 
spaces will all be gone within a couple decades. You just don't put in an 
airport and have nothing happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo council, which has gone on record against the airport, has also 
all but killed city participation with Oxnard and Ventura in construction of a 
$15.6-million minor league baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 While council members have requested a status report from stadium consultants 
next month, they are not expected to change their opposition to spending city 
funds on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue that will continue to confront residents in 1995 will be the 
battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first of the crop-destroying pests were discovered Sept. 29 in a fig 
tree in the St. John's Seminary orchard, state and federal agriculture 
officials have responded with aerial sprayings of the pesticide malathion. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Hawkins, spokesman for the state and federal Cooperative Medfly Project, 
said the aerial spray missions, which dispense a sticky mixture of the 
pesticide and corn syrup, have gone off without any mishaps so far. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 66 of the insects have been caught in panel traps, with the last 
discovery Nov. 22. Hawkins said officials will probably continue the spray 
missions about every two weeks through April, or through at least two complete 
life cycles of the fly. The cooler the weather, the longer the fly's life 
cycle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprayings have touched off loud protests. More than 300 people attended a 
recent town hall meeting that featured a panel of medical doctors, scientists 
and biologists opposed to the sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
 While Camarillo council members have said they have no control over the 
sprayings, they have supported the eradication missions, citing agriculture's 
importance to the county's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the spraying have formed an association called Group Against 
Spraying People, or GASP. The group has pleaded with the council to reverse its 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I urge you to look at the information the state is presenting (on the safety 
of malathion) and then compare it to independent, peer-reviewed research," 
Terri Gaishin, the organization's chairwoman, said in a recent letter to the 
council. "This is an unpopular, controversial program that should be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 The city next year is also expected to confront the concern that there are 
insufficient activities for youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Craven said that issue, plus finding funds to add another youth officer to the 
city's police force, will be among her priorities in 1995. She advocates using 
the additional youth officer to fight the encroachment of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of them (Camarillo teen-agers) are good kids," Craven said. "I 
just think that as a city, we should be doing more in this area. I also think 
that we need another youth officer to make sure we can head off any problems 
before they get a chance to get started." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo City Council will hold an informal goal-setting session Feb. 4. 
The public is invited to attend the meeting, which will start at 9 a.m. at City 
Hall, 601 Carmen Drive.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; POSTPONED AERIAL SPRAYING TO RESUME

<P>
 Aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion was rescheduled for Wednesday night 
after flights Tuesday were canceled by the Cooperative Medfly Project in 
Camarillo due to heavy fog. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-flying helicopters were expected to take off about 10 p.m. Wednesday as 
state agriculture officials continue their attack on the Mediterranean fruit 
fly, which was first found in Camarillo in late September. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night's malathion spraying over 16 square miles in east Camarillo 
would be the sixth of 12 scheduled applications. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, dozens of people concerned about the long-term health effects of 
the aerial spraying protested against the chemical's use outside the Ventura 
County Health Department in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 State and local health officials maintain that the pesticide is safe in small 
doses. JEFF McDONALD

 Ventura police are seeking two men who entered a clothing store with a 
sawed-off shotgun and escaped with cash, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the men entered Susie's Deals in the 4700 block of 
Telephone Road about 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the men brandished the shotgun and demanded money from the store clerk, 
according to police. No one was hurt in the robbery, which netted the suspects 
an undisclosed amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 No one at the store on Wednesday would discuss the robbery. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; LIBRARY COMPUTER TO RECEIVE UPGRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Book lovers take notice: The Oxnard Public Library is improving its computer 
system next week, and patrons will not be able to renew books or acquire 
library cards for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Library services manager Linda Katsouleas said the upgrade will bolster the 
computer's abilities.Users will be able to reserve books without help from 
staff, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 The $12-million, 72,000-square-foot library has more than 250,000 books on its 
shelves, and an average of 2,000 patrons visit the building each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Katsouleas said library personnel will still be busy checking out books with 
paper and ink while the upgrade takes place from Jan. 3 to 8 and would be 
overburdened by the other duties usually handled by the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be doing it the old-fashioned way -- on paper," Katsouleas said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said library staff will make one exception: Those with overdue 
books should return them and pay the fines. The librarians will gladly process 
those by hand. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PROFESSIONALS SOUGHT FOR CAREER PROGRAM 
</P>

 Ventura recreation officials are seeking firefighters, police officers and 
professionals in a variety of other fields for a new program aimed at helping 
young people develop career goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Each volunteer for the youth mentoring program, which will begin in February, 
will be assigned to a local teen-ager who has shown interest in the adult's 
line of work, said Roberta Payan, the Westpark Recreation Center director who 
is organizing the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Because organizers want to reach youths who have difficulty forming career 
goals, they are opening the 10-week program only to students who attend 
continuation schools or alternative education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will accept about 40 Ventura students, all between 13 and 16 years 
old, who attend either Pacific or El Camino high schools in Ventura or the 
Community Alliance Program or Gateway Continuation School in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Young people in such programs have left or have been forced to leave 
traditional schools, often because of discipline problems or academic 
difficulties. And like many other youths, such students may have unrealistic 
career goals, Payan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all want to be either professional athletes or neurosurgeons," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also apparently interested in jobs they see on television or come 
into contact with in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the nearly 100 students who have applied for admission into the 
mentoring program, the most popular career choice is firefighting. Police work 
ranked second. And many youths also said they are interested in becoming 
probation officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said they want to work as graphic artists, computer technicians, 
photographers, registered nurses, fashion designers, carpet installers and in a 
variety of other fields. 
</P>
<P>
 To become a mentor or for more information, call Payan at 648-1895 or Westpark 
recreation leader Lydia Lovio at 658-4760. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MAN ARRESTED AFTER BOMB FOUND IN VAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 East county sheriff's deputies investigating a suspicious vehicle discovered a 
homemade pipe bomb in the back of a van, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies Mark Englander and John Smith stopped in the 6700 block of Santa 
Susana Pass Road about 4 a.m. Wednesday after they noticed that the 
registration tags on a parked van appeared to have been altered. 
</P>
<P>
 During the inspection, William Patrick McGinley approached the deputies, 
asking about their inquiry. The deputies identified McGinley as the owner of 
the van and determined that the registration tags had been forged, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 McGinley, 42, of Simi Valley later gave deputies permission to search the van, 
and they found the homemade pipe bomb in the cargo area, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Sheriff's Department bomb squad was called in to dismantle 
the device, which was rendered safe and is now being held in evidence, deputies 
said. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 McGinley was arrested on suspicion of possessing an explosive device and 
forging vehicle registration tags -- both felonies, a Ventura County Jail 
commander said. 
</P>
<P>
 He remains in custody in lieu of $100,000 bail and is scheduled to be 
arraigned in Ventura County Municipal Court today or Friday. JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 In what has become a post-holiday tradition, the Ventura County Solid Waste 
Management Department will be picking up Christmas trees in the next few weeks 
for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Before recycling the tree, residents should carefully remove all ornaments, 
nails, tinsel, metal support rods and tree stands. Flocked or fireproofed trees 
cannot be accepted for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents with yard debris collection can put their tree into their yard 
debris barrel at any time, county officials said. In addition, curbside 
collection and drop-off locations will be available in various communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the county collected 80,000 trees, which were recycled into garden 
mulch, according to county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bell Canyon: Curbside Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Camarillo: Curbside Jan. 9. Apartment complexes by appointment.

debris barrel on Jan. 6 and 20 or drop off at Mountain View and Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ojai and upper Ojai Valley: Place tree inside of or next to yard debris 
barrel on the normal collection day through Jan. 6.

the normal refuse collection day. 
</P>
<P>

service). 
</P>
<P>

yard debris barrel on yard debris collection day through Jan. 6. Apartment 
complexes by appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unincorporated Ventura County: Place tree in yard debris barrel and set out 
on the normal yard debris collection day. Call your hauler for information on 
special pickups. 
</P>
<P>

and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.  
</P>
<P>

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LAW AIMED AT CURBING DRUNK DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Motorists who have had their licenses suspended and are caught driving could 
lose their vehicle to the government under a state law that takes effect 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Driving is a privilege and not a right," state Sen. Jack O'Connell 
(D-Carpinteria) said during a news conference Wednesday at California Highway 
Patrol headquarters in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in front of a black pickup truck damaged in an alcohol-related 
accident, O'Connell said the new law is aimed at taking "bad drivers off the 
road." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am hopeful that these new statutes will help give law enforcement 
additional tools to get the drinking driver off our highways," O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, a motorist with a suspended license who is caught driving 
will have his or her vehicle impounded and could be forced to pay a stiff fine 
to get it back, O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
 If a second violation occurs within five years, the government will have the 
authority to sell the vehicle and use the proceeds to pay impoundment fees or 
any outstanding debts on the vehicle. Leftover money would be divided among the 
government agencies handling the case, O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, police have a vehicle towed when its driver does not have a valid 
license. But the driver can get the vehicle back by paying impoundment fees, 
said CHP spokeswoman Staci Morse. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as people bring a driver's license with them and pay the fees, we 
release the car," Morse said. "With the new law, the vehicle (could) be sold 
the second time it's impounded." 
</P>
<P>
 Also beginning Sunday, citations may be issued to minors not wearing an 
approved bicycle helmet while riding a bicycle on the street, a bikeway or a 
public path, O'Connell said. CHRISTINA LIMA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PROFESSIONAL SINGER TO HEAD SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ELIAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County Symphony officials have hired a professional singer as their 
new executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Hesselbach, 39, will assume the symphony's top post Tuesday, 
officials said.She replaces Karine Beesley, who resigned earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the job, she will oversee a staff of four employees and administer an 
annual budget of $730,000. She will also be in charge of fund-raising for the 
33-year-old symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Felice Ginsberg, president of the symphony's board of directors, said 
Hesselbach was chosen from among 30 applicants.  
</P>
<P>
 Ginsberg declined to give Hesselbach's salary, but Beesley cited a wage freeze 
on her $38,900 annual salary as a factor in her resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the 60-member symphony has run into serious financial 
difficulties. It began the fiscal year with a $180,000 deficit, and its 
financial woes were compounded when the symphony's musicians sought a 
collective bargaining agreement for the first time.  
</P>
<P>
 But Ginsberg said Hesselbach, who now lives in San Pedro, has a combination of 
arts and business experience that should help her get through any rough spots. 
</P>
<P>
 The symphony needs to raise $150,000 next year to get a matching federal grant 
of $50,000. In addition, a permanent contract must still be signed by the 
musicians, who agreed to an interim contract weeks before the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Hesselbach's last related job was two years ago when she held management 
positions with the Da Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's College in Los 
Angeles. The Da Camera Society presents chamber music concerts in historic 
locations around Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Hesselbach said, she has been a free-lance public relations 
worker. She is a University of Redlands graduate with a bachelor of science 
degree in business and has worked as a professional choral singer. PAUL ELIAS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SUIT ACCUSES POLICE OF BEATING MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley man filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the city's Police 
Department, charging that officers beat him and falsely arrested him following 
a traffic stop in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit claims that 36-year-old Gary Wilson Scott was stopped Jan. 2 on 
suspicion of drunk driving near his Heywood Street condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 After passing field-sobriety tests, Scott was arrested by Officer Matthew P. 
McCord, who noticed that Scott did not have a front license plate on his car, 
the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the arrest, Scott was thrown to the ground and sprayed in the face with 
Mace, according to his suit. It accuses the officers of "hog tying" and choking 
Scott, who allegedly suffered injuries to his head, neck, upper extremities and 
"psyche." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott was charged with resisting arrest, obstruction of justice and driving on 
a suspended license, but the charges were later dropped, the suit states. Scott 
was not charged with failing to have a front license plate on his car. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit names as defendants the city, McCord, Chief Willard R. Schlieter and 
former Chief Lindsey Paul Miller, who is now a city councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 The department spokesman was not immediately available for comment. DWAYNE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY, MOORPARK; QUAKE BLAMED FOR SLOWER HOME 
SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley and Moorpark realtors are blaming the Northridge earthquake for 
slow home sales and lower resale prices in recent months, including a modest 
decline in November sales reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, 128 homes closed escrow in Simi Valley and Moorpark, a 1.5% drop 
from the same month in 1993.The average resale price of a single-family house, 
which was $201,010 in November, was down 3.2% from November, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Area realtors said the earthquake, along with rising interest rates, accounted 
for the modest decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, brokers said they were confident that the numbers would rebound as the 
economy improves and memory of the earthquake fades. Projections show that 
despite the decline in November, home sales over the course of 1994 will be up 
from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 And, they said, they were banking on first-time buyers -- who made up about 
60% of the new home buyers in recent months -- to help boost sales in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barring further increases in the interest rate or another surprise from 
Mother Nature, 1995 should be an even more fantastic year of opportunity for 
first-time home buyers," said Shanon Wolf, president of the Simi 
Valley-Moorpark Assn. of Realtors. "There are a lot of good signs out there 
that, despite these problems, things are picking up." MATTHEW MOSK

YEAR OF DECISIONS IS AWAITED IN SIMI; GOVERNMENT: CITY OFFICIALS ARE OPTIMISTIC 
ABOUT A HEALTHY 1995. IN COMING MONTHS, THEY HOPE TO DECIDE THE FATES OF 
SEVERAL KEY PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Will 1995 be the year Simi Valley finally gets its own mall? Will work be 
completed on the now-stalled Cultural Arts Center? And how about working to 
move the city's police force out of cramped quarters and into a new station? 
</P>
<P>
 With any luck, city leaders are hoping to answer these questions over the next 
12 months with a resounding yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring any major disasters on the scale of January's earthquake, the year 
ahead should be one of the healthiest for Simi Valley, council members agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, sales tax revenues are rebounding from the recession, up 10% over a 
year earlier. And 1994 brought new business to the city, including a 
Warner/Electric/Atlanta distribution warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we don't have a crystal ball, but I think everyone is pretty 
optimistic about the coming year," Mayor Greg Stratton said. "We're making good 
progress on our earthquake recovery, and we're seeing signs that development is 
going to pick up. So we're looking forward to a very good year." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, as Simi Valley enters its 26th year as an incorporated city, Stratton 
is planning to launch a project for the next quarter-century of cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, called Vision 2020, would include discussions with residents on the 
future of the city and studies of older cities similar to Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said he will propose Vision 2020, which he expects would cost about 
$30,000, at a council meeting in late January. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking just one year ahead at a time really doesn't give you the kind of 
perspective that will keep your city in good shape," Stratton said. "I think 
this is the perfect time to take a long look at where we've come from and where 
we're heading." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the city's major goals in recent years has been the construction of a 
first-class mall on 126 acres of prime hillside overlooking the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed more than two decades ago, the project was well on its way toward 
construction in 1991 when the recession hit and the developer backed out. 
</P>
<P>
 With the project stalled since then, the city in December, 1993, bought a 
32-acre parcel of the land zoned for the mall, hoping to ease the way for a 
development firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a developer has expressed interest in the project, meeting several 
times with city officials, Deputy City Manager Don Penman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very possible we could have a new developer signed on to this project 
in the coming year," said Penman, who said he could not yet reveal the name of 
the potential builder. "All signs are that we are going to see some real 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
 A second major project, and one that the city hopes to see completed in 1995, 
is the Cultural Arts Center on Los Angeles Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few city efforts that caused contention on an otherwise collegial 
council, the $2.6-million project to restore a 1920s church was approved in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwomen Sandi Webb and Barbara Williamson opposed the 300-seat theater, 
saying private money, not public funds, should pay for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the project contractor, not unhappy council members, who prompted 
the city to halt work on the arts center last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys-based contractor in charge of the job was fired after performing 
substandard work and failing to pay subcontractors for several months, Deputy 
City Manager Bob Heitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two weeks, the bond company that insured the contractor will hire a new 
firm to finish the project at no additional cost to the city, Heitzman said. 
Completion of the work could be delayed several months, from February to May. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we had hoped to finish the work in February, we had scheduled the 
official opening for May, to give ourselves a buffer," Heitzman said. "So we're 
still in pretty good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 The third large project the council plans to focus on in the coming year is 
the construction of a new police station to replace the overcrowded, 
quake-damaged quarters on Cochran Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to build the new station on one of three sites at City Hall or 
across the street on property owned by the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming months, a committee made up of council members Webb and Lindsey Paul 
Miller will begin looking for an architect to design the new station, which 
could be built within three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This coming year is going to be very important for this project," said 
Miller, who served as the city's police chief before being elected to the 
council in November. "What we have to do is lay a solid groundwork so that we 
avoid delays and make sure the rest of the project goes smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the major development concerns facing the city, some council 
members said they intend to focus much of their energy on completing other 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis said he is especially concerned about repairing roads 
damaged in the quake, building more housing for poor senior citizens and 
upgrading the city's flood control channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are all things I've been concerned about for quite some time," Davis 
said. "I think my New Year's resolution for 1995 will be to see to it that they 
get taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Councilwoman Webb vowed to launch her own pet project, Operation 
Pet Save, to ensure that cats and dogs in Simi Valley wear identity tags. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-proclaimed cat lover with four felines of her own, Webb has persuaded a 
company that makes tags and electronic ID chips to print thousands of brochures 
urging owners to tag their pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This might not seem like such a big deal," Webb said. "But when you think of 
all those lost cats and dogs that end up being put to death, you realize how 
important it is."

AROUND THE VALLEY: FIGURE SKATERS JUMP THROUGH HOOPS TO PURSUE AN ICY PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's just after 6 in the morning. It's still dark out. It's cold. 
</P>
<P>
 And Kari Latta and Irene Wainwright are standing on a grungy Van Nuys side 
street. In their ice skates. 
</P>
<P>
 Illuminated by the weird glow of the GTE sign over the pay phone, they are 
trying to find Brian, the guy who was supposed to have opened the Iceland rink 
at 5:30. But no luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could be in our beds, snuggled up nice and warm with our husbands. But 
here we are, waiting to try to get in to the ice rink," Latta says. "What's 
wrong with us?" 
</P>
<P>
 Just a passion for figure skating -- the kind of passion that drives otherwise 
ordinary people to extraordinary lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley rinks such as Iceland, the early birds are the perky and dependable 
harbingers of the new day, there before the hockey goons to take advantage of 
smooth ice for their spins, loops and jumps. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a way of life, and not just for tots or Tonya Harding -- well, Nancy 
Kerrigan -- wanna-bes. 
</P>
<P>
 Latta, 27, lives in West Los Angeles and teaches first grade at the Buckley 
School in Sherman Oaks. Wainwright, 49, the mother of two sons, lives in 
Reseda; she is a researcher at UCLA currently working on a book about epilepsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wainwright took up ice skating about 10 years ago. Growing up in South Africa, 
there were no rinks. "We used to skate around frosty front lawns and pretend it 
was a rink. So this," she says, "is the fulfillment of a childhood dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Now she's at the rink three times a week. "At first, my husband said, 'What 
are you doing skating with all these little kids?' Then when he saw what it was 
doing for my psyche -- and my figure -- he was all for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Latta skates five times a week. She is always on the lookout for professional 
opportunities and, in fact, had a brief cameo in a movie spoof of the 
Harding-Kerrigan affair, "National Lampoon's Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 Women." 
</P>
<P>
 But skating, she says, is not about making money. The real reward, she says, 
is in the repetition of practice, the demands of combining the physical 
challenge of a perch on skates with the artistry and grace of ballet, the 
unrestrained joy of landing a difficult maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you land that jump, you nail that spin, it's like nothing else," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 She adds: "It is the essence of my being, this skating." And her routine is 
organized entirely around it. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekdays she's up at 5 a.m. She gets dressed and makes breakfast -- two 
eggs and two pieces of toast. On the way to the rink, she eats. And she washes 
it down with a cup of coffee from Starbucks. 
</P>
<P>
 But -- she doesn't stop along the way. That would take precious time away from 
skating. Instead, she drinks coffee she bought the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 "A grande half-caf," she says, referring to the coffee's size and caffeine 
punch, "with a lot of milk. I buy it at night. I warm it up in my microwave in 
the morning. Starbucks isn't open at 5 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Iceland opens at 5:30. Latta is on the ice by 5:45 and done about 7:15. Then 
it's off to work. "When you have to work for a living," Latta says, "this is 
the only time you can skate -- early." 
</P>
<P>
 The value of work, of course, is that it pays for all that skating. Like scuba 
diving or skiing, skating is an expensive habit. Skates, good ones, cost 
hundreds of dollars. Latta's, a nifty beige pair -- "When you wear brown 
tights, the skates blend in with your tights. And it makes your legs look 
longer" -- ran $1,100. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are lessons. A coach often charges $50 to $100 per hour. Wainwright 
has two coaches -- one for freestyle skating, one for ice dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Iceland is a popular practice spot. It's located near the Van Nuys 
government complex, across the street from an LAPD auto repair barn, between a 
nut store and an auto parts shop. With such low overhead, early morning time at 
Iceland costs as little as $5 per session. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, national champions such as Linda Fratianne, Christopher Bowman 
and Tiffany Chin have all taken to the Iceland ice. 
</P>
<P>
 But on this morning, the skaters are marooned on the asphalt outside the rink. 
Robin McCarthy, Latta's coach, arrives about 6:30 a.m. The sun finally 
brightens the morning. But still no Brian. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing," Latta says. "You get yourself out of bed. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "And that sheet of ice is just sitting there," Wainwright says. "It's just 
sitting there." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have to wait until tomorrow," Latta says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could always break through the side door," McCarthy says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tempted," Latta says, and sighs. "I'm very tempted." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, about 7, the iceman cometh. But it's not Brian. It's Barry, who's 
Brian's relief. "It's pretty shocking that (Brian) isn't here," McCarthy says. 
"He's usually very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry opens the padlock. It's too late, however, for Wainwright, who has to go 
off to work. "I didn't get the exercise that I really needed," she laments. 
</P>
<P>
 Because school's out for the winter holidays, however, Latta has time on her 
hands. She blissfully toddles onto the ice for 90 minutes, swishing through 
spins and working earnestly -- under McCarthy's direction -- on double-toe 
loops and double salchows. 
</P>
<P>
 When she steps off, she pronounces that life is indeed good: "I fell a few 
times, which is the nature of the game. But the important thing is that we 
skated. That's what counts."

PACKERS' SHARPE OUT OF PLAYOFFS; PRO FOOTBALL: RECEIVER HAS NECK INJURY THAT 
WILL REQUIRE SURGERY. HIS CAREER IS THREATENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Green Bay Packers spent the exhibition season learning how to play without 
injury-prone Pro Bowl receiver Sterling Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they will have to use that knowledge in the playoffs -- and maybe beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe has a neck abnormality that will require surgery and could end his 
career, team physician Patrick McKenzie announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe sustained "stinger" nerve injuries in each of the last two games, 
sinking to the turf in excruciating pain with numbness and then tingling in his 
limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Pepper Burris said the injuries resulted from unusual looseness 
between the top two vertebrae in Sharpe's neck. The condition was gradual and 
became apparent on Dec. 18 when his head snapped back while he was blocking 
Atlanta safety Brad Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe must undergo surgery to fuse the two vertebrae, McKenzie said. It will 
take eight months for Sharpe to recover from the procedure, which has yet to be 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 After the recovery period, the team and Sharpe will decide whether he should 
play again, McKenzie and Packer Coach Mike Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, any cervical spine injury is career-threatening," said McKenzie, 
who added that he was unaware of any other NFL player who has had surgery on 
the first and second cervical vertebrae. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie said Sharpe needs to have the surgery even if he chooses never to 
play again. 
</P>
<P>
 "There could be some long-term ramifications of not having surgery that we 
don't think are smart to live with," McKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the diagnosis, Sharpe, who recovered from off-season toe surgery and 
tight hamstrings to catch a club-record 18 touchdown passes, was his usual 
jovial self in the locker room before practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe's loss is a big blow to the Packers going into Saturday's playoff game 
against the Detroit Lions at Lambeau Field. He had 94 catches this season for 
1,119 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means we have some juggling to do," Holmgren said. "We all want him to get 
healthy, then deal with whatever happens after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Receivers Robert Brooks and Anthony Morgan figure to be quarterback Brett 
Favre's main targets. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sharpe sat out the second half against the Falcons 11 days ago, he was 
given an MRI test and was cleared to play last Saturday at Tampa. He again 
experienced numbness in his limbs after he was tackled in the fourth quarter by 
the Buccaneers' Charles Dimry. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe missed practice Tuesday when he was examined by a neck specialist in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Packers have suffered neck injuries. Linebacker Johnny Holland 
retired in the off-season because of one, and cornerback Roland Mitchell may 
retire after undergoing similar surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 In seven NFL seasons, Sharpe has 595 receptions for 8,134 yards and 65 
touchdowns. He is a five-time Pro Bowl selection and a backup this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He broke the NFL single-season record for receptions in 1993 with 112. Cris 
Carter of Minnesota surpassed that total this season with 119 catches. In his 
last six games, Sharpe caught 43 passes for 574 yards and 13 touchdowns as the 
Packers made the playoffs for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe walked out on the eve of the '94 season opener, saying he wanted to be 
pro football's highest-paid receiver. The team restructured his contract, 
giving him $2.7 million this season and ensuring he would be the NFL's 
highest-paid receiver from 1995 through 2000.

NEW SULTANS OF SWAP ARE PADRES, ASTROS; BASEBALL: FATHER AND SON EXECUTIVES IN 
MIDDLE OF 12-PLAYER DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving company stock might shoot up today after the biggest baseball trade in 
37 years, involving 12 players, two teams and a father and son. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Padres and the Houston Astros swapped one-fourth of their 
regular-season rosters Wednesday in the first deal since owners imposed a 
salary cap last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Packing for San Diego are infielders Ken Caminiti, Andujar Cedeno and Roberto 
Petagine, outfielder Steve Finley, pitcher Brian Williams and a player to be 
named. If the teams can't agree on the player by April 30, the Padres get 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Packing for Houston are outfielders Phil Plantier and Derek Bell, pitchers 
Pedro Martinez and Doug Brocail and infielders Craig Shipley and Ricky 
Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 Add it up and it's the biggest deal in terms of players changing teams since 
Nov. 20, 1957, when the Kansas City Athletics and Detroit Tigers combined for a 
13-player trade that included Billy Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Astro-Padre player parade falls short of the record for one 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees and Baltimore Orioles had an 18-player deal after the 1954 season, 
a trade so big it was announced over a two-week span. Bob Turley, Don Larsen 
and Gus Triandos were part of that deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Wednesday's deal deserves its own place in baseball lore, not 
merely because of sheer numbers, but because of who was sitting in the corners 
of their respective smoke-filled rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 They were Smiths. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego's general manager is Randy Smith. Houston's president is Tal Smith, 
Randy's father. Afterward, they probably talked about swapping their Christmas 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Smith downplayed the role of his father in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we talked about it as we got closer to finalizing it," Randy Smith 
said. "But 99% of the conversations were with (Houston General Manager Bob) 
Watson." 
</P>
<P>
 If the players' strike ends, the deal is expected to dramatically improve the 
Padres, who were 47-70 and had the worst record in the major leagues last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Software tycoon John Moores, who is from Houston, bought the Padres Dec. 21 
from a group headed by television producer Tom Werner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres had the lowest payroll in the majors last year at $13.77 million, 
but they can go up as much as $20 million under the new cap. Houston, which 
signed Jeff Bagwell to a $27.5-million, four-year deal in November, needs to 
drop $1.62 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros already unloaded pitcher Pete Harnisch and his hefty contract in a 
trade that brought minor league prospects from the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 Tal Smith likes the trade the Astros made with Randy Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've increased our run production, we've improved our pitching depth, we're 
a younger team, we have greater control over the players who are coming to us 
and we improved our condition under the salary cap," Tal Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres lose their two leading power hitters, Plantier (18 homers, 41 runs 
batted in last season) and Bell (14 homers, 54 RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
 Caminiti, a first-time all-star in 1994, and Cedeno are expected to strengthen 
the left side of the infield. With Luis Lopez the heir apparent at second base, 
Bip Roberts is expected to be moved to left field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bell and Plantier are the kinds of players who can give us protection for 
Jeff Bagwell and power in the middle of the lineup," Watson said. "We have 
always been looking for more pop in the middle."

WILL THEY GO AGAINST LAW?; MICHIGAN CORNERBACK HAS BEEN ON LOSING END OF SOME 
BIG PLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It not only happened once to Ty Law, it happened twice. Two times the grief. 
Two times the ignominy. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened during his freshman season two years ago in the din of Notre Dame 
Stadium when a questionable pass-interference call in the end zone with 11:25 
left helped the Irish gain a 17-17 tie against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it happened again in September before 106,427 at Michigan Stadium during 
the game's final play against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Law, a cornerback, was in the middle of a game-deciding play. This one, 
though, was a spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see it all the time on (ESPN's) SportsCenter, in the news," Law said the 
other day in San Diego as No. 20 Michigan prepared to play No. 10 Colorado 
State in Friday's Thrifty Car Rental Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in all the highlight films. I've been on the cover of Sports 
Illustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Law was victimized in what was perhaps the season's most exciting play, a 
70-yard Hail Mary pass from Colorado's Kordell Stewart that was tipped before 
the Buffaloes' Michael Westbrook dived, caught it and rolled in the end zone 
with no time remaining for a 27-26 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nothing spectacular," said Law, one of the few who think it wasn't. 
"It was a wish play . . . just a bunch of hope. He threw it a long ways . . . 
further than expected. . . . It went straight up and came straight down. It had 
a lot of velocity, it was very fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Law, the backbone of Michigan's much-maligned secondary, turned in midair and 
grabbed Westbrook, but it was too late. Colorado (10-1) was on its way to a 
great season; Michigan (7-4) was headed to a pedestrian year that would include 
the wrong Southern California bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something that will always stick in the back of my mind, something 
that I can always look at (and say), 'Damn, why me?' " Law said of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing like that seemed to deflate Michigan. The Wolverines lost to Ohio 
State, Penn State and Wisconsin to finish third in the Big Ten. If they lose to 
Colorado State on Friday, it will be Coach Gary Moeller's worst record since 
taking over for Bo Schembechler in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you play a game so hard and you have it, then it's taken away from you, 
it takes a lot out of you," said Tyrone Wheatley, Michigan's running back.  
</P>
<P>
 At least Law was prepared for the scrutiny. The pass-interference call in 1992 
came in his first game for Michigan against one of the Wolverines' biggest 
rivals.  
</P>
<P>
 "People thought it would break me," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't. And neither did the Colorado game. Law, who had six interceptions 
his junior season but none this year, was named All-Big Ten for '94 because of 
his outstanding coverage. He also made two All-American teams.  
</P>
<P>
 Law, 6 feet and 201 pounds, came to Ann Arbor after leading Aliquippa High to 
the Pennsylvania state title in 1991. Although Penn State is playing in the 
Rose Bowl this season, Law has no regrets about leaving Pennsylvania. After 
growing up in suburban Pittsburgh and being raised by a grandfather who worked 
in the steel mills for 30 years, Law wanted to get away.  
</P>
<P>
 He does wonder what would have happened had he gone south instead of north. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had gone down to Florida State where I could showcase my talents on what 
I do best on the field. . . ." his voice trails off thinking of what might have 
been. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel (like) more of a flashy guy, a Florida State or Miami player," Law 
said. "I like to go out there and (play) man-to-man the whole game. Strut a 
little bit."  
</P>
<P>
 Not at Michigan, where Moeller runs a hard-nosed, disciplined program. Law 
realizes the benefits of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's better for me down the road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that road leads to the NFL next season or another fall in Ann Arbor, 
Law will not say. He hopes to have the kind of bowl game that gets attention. 
If so, he might forgo his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State's quarterback, Anthoney Hill, is expected to test Michigan's 
secondary and Law. The Rams play wide-open Western Athletic Conference football 
and are quicker than the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all you can ask for," Law said. "There are times you get out there 
and get kind of lackadaisical because you know they are going to run the ball . 
. . and never pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Law said the defensive backs want to redeem themselves to critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say we hurt this team," Law said. "We can prove we are not what they say 
we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the apparent failings of the secondary, Moeller has been more than 
satisfied with Law's improvement this year, particularly with his tackling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any guy can get beat," Moeller said, "but he has made some fine plays."

STOP SAPP? CALL ASAP; IF ANYONE HAS A CLUE ABOUT HOW TO CONTAIN MIAMI'S TACKLE, 
NEBRASKA'S COACHES WOULD PROBABLY LIKE TO HEAR IT

 After Rutgers lost to Miami earlier this season, Mark Deal received a phone 
call from Jimmy Heggins. Deal is the offensive line coach at Rutgers, Heggins 
is the offensive line coach at Florida State. Heggins needed information . . . 
and hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seminoles were to play Miami next and everyone knew what that meant: 
Warren Sapp, the best college defensive lineman on the planet. So Heggins, who 
had never spoken to Deal before, didn't waste much time with pleasantries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach," said Heggins, his North Carolina accent in full bloom, "how'd y'all 
do against him?" 
</P>
<P>
 Deal considered the damage. Sapp had recorded seven tackles, a sack, four 
quarterback pressures and a fumble recovery. So dominating was the performance, 
Miami coaches presented Sapp with a game ball. Yet, after reviewing the 
videotape to grade his offensive linemen, Deal thought the Scarlet Knights had 
done a decent job. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was the scary part -- it could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Heggins waited for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you got to hope," Deal told the Florida State coach. "You got to hope 
for a rainstorm so he can't get any traction. That's the only way you're going 
to slow him down." 
</P>
<P>
 Heggins probably was hoping for more than a number to the National Weather 
Service. But Deal was right. Under mostly rain-free skies, Miami defeated the 
Seminoles and guess who got another game ball? Sapp recorded seven tackles, two 
sacks, two pass breakups and three quarterback pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Deal saw the whole thing on TV. He knew what Heggins was going through. 
</P>
<P>
 "After watching him play against Florida State that Saturday night, I felt a 
lot better about how we did," Deal said. "In fact, I told my linemen a couple 
days later, 'You know, we ought to feel pretty good about that game.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In a nutshell, this is what the 6-foot-3, 280-pound Sapp does to opponents. He 
reduces everything to relative terms. If anyone else dominates Rutgers the way 
Sapp did, Deal will have his linemen pushing blocking sleds up the New Jersey 
Turnpike. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sapp isn't like anyone else, which explains why Deal sought out the 
Hurricane star after the Oct. 1 game at Rutgers Stadium and said, "Warren, 
you're a great, great player." It is why Deal assigned two blockers to Sapp the 
entire four quarters, why Deal would have cast a Heisman vote for the Miami 
junior, why Deal is kicking himself for not teaching his linemen how to hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best I've seen," Deal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapp finished the regular season with a Lombardi Award and was the only 
defensive player invited to the Heisman Trophy presentation ceremony. He became 
buddies with Heisman winner Rashaan Salaam, the Colorado running back who was 
later sighted wearing a Hurricane baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapp didn't come close to Salaam in the balloting, but he didn't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way am I going to get 920 (voters) to say I'm the best player in the 
country," he said that day at the Downtown Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, none of those 920 voters had to block him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapp is a coach's poster boy. Unselfish. Relentless. Borderline obsessed. In 
each of his three seasons at Miami, Sapp's numbers have improved dramatically. 
From zero starts in 1992 to 12 this year; from 39 tackles to 84; from three 
sacks to 10 1/2; from zero fumbles caused to four; from zero fumbles recovered 
to three. 
</P>
<P>
 All this from a former high school tight end, linebacker and punter who wanted 
nothing more than to become the first 280-pound winner of the Butkus Award. 
Instead, Hurricane coaches converted him to defensive tackle and hoped for the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just thinking about getting on the field, just playing," Sapp said in a 
telephone interview. "Just let my boys see me on TV one time. That's all there 
was to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami ended up with a star, the latest in an impressive line of Hurricane 
defensive tackles that in recent years stretches from Jerome Brown to Russell 
Maryland to Cortez Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Sapp knows all about Miami football history. As a freshman in 1991, 
he went out one night with Kennedy, Hurricane linebacker Jesse Armstead and 
Brown, who by then was an All-Pro with the Philadelphia Eagles. Brown died in 
an auto accident later that year, but the memory of the meeting never left 
Sapp. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Hurricanes traveled to Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium to play Temple 
last month, Sapp was outraged to find not a single official remembrance of 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The years he gave (the Eagles) were great ones and it's like they don't even 
care that he played there," Sapp said. "There's no memory of him in any kind of 
way. If a player's there for (years), the least you can do is put a jersey up 
for him or something . . . a '99' (his jersey number) on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet you those people in Philly remember him. There's a Jerome Brown Assn. 
they started up there. It benefits the kids of Philly. If the city can do it, 
at least that raggedy organization could." 
</P>
<P>
 Sapp is emotional that way. When Washington was putting the finishing touches 
on its stunning 38-20 victory over the Hurricanes, ending Miami's NCAA-record 
58-game home winning streak -- Sapp still played as if a miracle were possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Morton, Washington's offensive line coach, remembers his players coming 
off the field after a 13-play, 6:58 scoring drive sealed the victory. They were 
talking about the amazing Sapp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was at the end of the game," Morton said. "We had controlled the ball. 
Several Miami players were taken out of the game. It was hot. It was physical. 
But my offensive linemen told me (Sapp) was still hustling. He was saying to 
the other Miami players, 'Get up. Have some pride. Let's get going.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State offensive coordinator Mark Richt, a former Miami quarterback, 
has seen this from Sapp for the last three years. That's why the Seminoles 
always made sure a center and guard or guard and tackle were placed in front of 
Sapp. Sometimes it worked, most times it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is this: If you don't get a special plan for him, he's going to 
disrupt an X amount of plays -- you just don't know how many," Richt said. "But 
if you do come up with a plan, then you're changing things that you normally do 
well. We're still trying to figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Seminole Coach Bobby Bowden said, "You see powerful guys who aren't quick. You 
see quick guys who aren't powerful. You don't see many guys who are powerful 
and quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden didn't think twice about putting two blockers on Sapp. Nobody does. Try 
stopping Sapp with one lineman and your quarterback will soon have to take an 
injury timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapp has seen every blocking scheme known to chalkboards. Boston College tried 
a weird one, pulling a guard to help the other guard block him. Interesting 
idea, but Sapp managed to finish with seven tackles. Virginia Tech kept moving 
a tight end to Sapp's side. Another opponent once double-teamed him on pass 
plays and then had a running back waiting to block, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always faced those kinds of things," Sapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hurricanes run the same defense they've run for years: four defensive 
linemen, three linebackers, two cornerbacks, two safeties. Nebraska, Miami's 
Orange Bowl opponent Sunday, probably knows the stunts and coverages by heart. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sapp is the centerpiece. He constantly punctures the pass pocket. He 
creates mismatches elsewhere on the line. He never stops. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first thought was, 'This guy has to choke himself to sleep at night,' " 
said J.B. Grimes, Virginia Tech's offensive line coach. "He's one of the few 
defensive linemen I've ever seen who can take total control of a game. And this 
guy does it from the tackle position." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes watched hours of film on the Hurricane defense. He said he never saw 
Sapp quit on a play. And in a goal-line defense, Sapp is even more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was while viewing Sapp against West Virginia that Grimes nearly fell 
off his chair. The Mountaineers fumbled. Sapp picked up the ball, started 
running and then put the sweetest juke move on some poor West Virginia player. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy just fell down," Grimes said. "Never seen anything like it. If (Sapp) 
had a lower (jersey) number, you would have thought he was a running back." 
</P>
<P>
 As the legend grows, so do the questions about Sapp's future. With another 
season of eligibility remaining, Sapp could return to Miami or make himself 
available for the NFL draft. Of course, don't bother asking Sapp about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: "So, Warren, have you given much thought to turning pro?" 
</P>
<P>
 Silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: "Uh, Warren, you there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sapp: "Yeah, I'm here." 
</P>
<P>
 Question: "So, do you give it much thought?" 
</P>
<P>
 Silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapp isn't impolite, merely tired of the constant inquiries. Rather than lie 
about his plans, he says nothing at all. Fair enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether this is his last college game or his first of 1995, Sapp 
won't have to worry about his Hurricane legacy. "He's great," Florida State's 
Richt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The '90s sign of greatness? Sapp leads the country in most-phone-calls caused.

NEWSWIRE: OWNERS WILL CALL UMPIRES OUT AFTER WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't strike II, it's lockout I in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's second labor dispute began Wednesday when owners notified umpires 
they will be locked out after this weekend and won't be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 National League President Len Coleman said the umpires received the lockout 
notification by overnight mail. Umpires are paid on a year-round basis and 
their four-year contract expires Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The union's request for a 60% pay increase is astronomical," Coleman said. 
"Given the tenor of the times, these demands are completely out of order." 
</P>
<P>
 The players' union denied a Houston Post report that Baltimore Oriole 
shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. has the blessing of striking players if he wants to 
cross their picket line to keep his consecutive games streak alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Astro relief pitcher Todd Jones was quoted as saying the union has 
told Ripken it won't mind if he's on the field with strikebreakers if that is 
how owners insist on starting the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gene Orza, union associate general counsel, said Jones' comments were 
taken out of context. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken has played in 2,009 consecutive games and is 122 shy of breaking Lou 
Gehrig's major league record. Hockey 
</P>
<P>
 There was no contact between the NHL and its players' association and none 
planned, leading sources connected with the league and the union to say 
negotiations probably won't resume until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 It's expected that Commissioner Gary Bettman will then urge union chief Bob 
Goodenow to reconsider his stance of refusing to talk as long as the NHL 
continues to seek a payroll tax or concessions from players on salary 
arbitration rights. Soccer

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; TOPS ON OFFENSE AND DEFENSE? IT'S SANDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a good year to be named Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Deion Sanders didn't need a full season to be selected the 1994 Associated 
Press defensive player of the year. And Barry Sanders was named offensive 
player of the year, even though he fell short of becoming the third player to 
rush for 2,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Deion Sanders waited until the baseball season was canceled in September 
before signing with the San Francisco 49ers as a free agent. It didn't matter 
to a panel of 98 sportswriters and broadcasters that the cornerback missed 
three games. He collected 39 votes to easily outdistance a pair of Pittsburgh 
Steelers, cornerback Rod Woodson, last year's winner, and linebacker Greg 
Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Only four players received votes on offense. Sanders had 53, followed by 
quarterback Steve Young of San Francisco with 41. Young's teammate, wide 
receiver Jerry Rice, got three votes, and Cris Carter of Minnesota got the 
other one. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really an honor," said Barry Sanders, who rushed for 1,883 yards for 
Detroit. "That means a lot, to me and to my teammates too. I was just part of 
the group. There are a lot of guys on this team that make me look good. I was 
able to reap the benefits of playing in a good offense with a good line, good 
receivers and a good quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Deion Sanders, who spent the first five NFL seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, 
said, "It's a wonderful achievement. Not for myself, but I think for 
(defensive) coach Ray Rhodes, because he's been responsible for capitalizing on 
my abilities, letting me play the way I'm playing, the way I'm being used. He's 
put me in the right situations." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco was the right place for Sanders, who played baseball and 
football in Atlanta in the 1993 season. He was traded to the Cincinnati Reds by 
the Braves, and he left the Falcons in the midst of a bidding war for his 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders turned down a more lucrative offer from New Orleans to sign with the 
49ers, who gave him an incentive-laden contract that will be worth $1.1 million 
if they win the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody knows this is the best business decision a man ever made," 
said Sanders, who had six interceptions, returning three for touchdowns and 
averaging 50.5 yards per return. "Everything is going as planned, better than 
planned." 
</P>

 Tom Flores returned to the Seattle Seahawks' headquarters Wednesday, refusing 
to say what happened after meeting in California with owner Ken Behring. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, the coach and general manager, is expected to be fired. The Seahawks 
are 14-34 in three seasons with Flores as coach, 6-10 this season. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Malcolm Glazer, who has tried to buy other sports teams, met Wednesday with 
trustees of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers about buying the perennial cellar-dweller. 
The West Palm Beach financier and his sons say they want to keep the Buccaneers 
in Tampa, said Steve Story, a member of the three-man trust overseeing the 
estate of late Buccaneer owner Hugh Culverhouse. . . . Miami's 27-20 victory 
over Detroit on Sunday night was the most-watched program in ESPN's 15-year 
history, reaching at least 8.9 million homes. . . . ABC ended its regular 
season with a 20.4 rating and 36 share, highest of the season, for its Monday 
night offering of Minnesota-San Francisco.

CSUN FOULS UP IN NEW MEXICO; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: LOBOS GET 36 MORE FREE THROWS 
THAN MATADORS IN 86-73 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Pete Cassidy shot a glance at a sheet of statistics after the game 
Wednesday and a couple of the numbers glared back. 
</P>
<P>
 Six and 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-six and 47. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't resist a small smile. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Cal State Northridge basketball team, just another night on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller numbers were Northridge's free throws and attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger digits belonged to New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a good defense for free throws," Cassidy cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 He needed one. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico used its big edge at the free-throw line to down Northridge, 86-73, 
in the first round of the Lobo Invitational before a near-capacity crowd of 
15,736 at The Pit. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will play Brown (3-4) at 5 p.m. PST today. Brown lost Wednesday to 
North Carolina Charlotte, 76-53. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge made four more field goals than New Mexico and converted 11 
three-point baskets to the Lobos' two. It just wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we played Ma Bell defense," Cassidy said, continuing his effort to 
laugh it off. "We reached out and touched someone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (2-6) fell behind, 8-2, at the outset, then played some of their 
best basketball of the season, taking control and leading by as many as 11 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Four players combined to make five three-point baskets for Northridge in the 
first half. Take away Ryan Martin's one-for-seven shooting and the Matadors 
made 15 of 23 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge held the advantage from the middle of the first half until Greg 
Schornstein scored on the second of back-to-back layups with 11:49 to play, 
giving New Mexico the lead, 57-55. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next six minutes, the Lobos outscored Northridge 15-5, with eight of 
their points coming from the free-throw line.  
</P>
<P>
 During that stretch, the Matadors made only one field goal while rushing 
several bad shots. Shane O'Doherty, Northridge's 6-11 center, and forward Mike 
Dorsey, who hasn't made a three-point shot this season, were among those 
casting off from long range. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were doing a good job of inside-outside," Cassidy said, referring to his 
team's ball movement. "Then for some reason we take four perimeter shots 
without a hint of looking inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who rebounded from his first-half shooting woes to score 13 points, 
attributed Northridge's poor shot selection to a lack of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the crowd out of it in the first half," Martin said, "but when they 
came back and took the lead on us, I think we panicked a little. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys are just not used to being in big games at the end right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Northridge's last road trip, that's certainly true. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors were outscored by a combined 98 points in losses to Cincinnati 
and Xavier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how they played in their wins, but they played very well tonight 
in a loss," New Mexico Coach Dave Bliss said of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Hayden paced New Mexico (5-4) with a career-high 26 points. He made 14 
of 17 free throws. Marlow White added 15 points, all in the second half. 
Clayton Shields had 12 points and a game-high nine rebounds, David Gibson added 
12 points and Charles Smith had 10. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico built most of its final margin by making 10 free throws in the last 
two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the home court for you," said Ruben Oronoz, who paced Northridge with 
18 points and six rebounds. "Everywhere we go, it doesn't get any easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially not here in Loboland. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico has won 15 consecutive games in its tournament and has won 20 of 29 
tournament titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could call this a moral victory just because of the way we played,"' 
Oronoz said. "Coming into The Pit, giving them a close game and leading in the 
first half are all positive things for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge might have fared better with swingman Shawn Stone, who is at home 
recovering from bronchitis. Stone's absence forced Cassidy to play freshman 
Trenton Cross and walk-on Ozan Korkut during key stretches of the second half.

INDEPENDENCE BOWL; NEITHER WEATHER NOR TCU CAN STOP VICTORIOUS VIRGINIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was raining and muddy. And that was fine with Virginia -- its string of 
four consecutive bowl losses finally put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to finally get that bowl losing streak off our backs," said 
Virginia Coach George Welsh. 
</P>
<P>
 With Mike Groh burning Texas Christian with a 37-yard scoring pass to Tyrone 
Davis in the third quarter, the No. 18 Cavaliers (9-3) beat the Horned Frogs, 
20-10, Wednesday night in the rain-soaked Independence Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we hit for that touchdown, we knew we could relax," said Davis. "We knew 
we could score on them any time we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The Horned Frogs wound up 7-5 for the year, and two players confessed they may 
have partied a little too hard in the flashy riverboat casinos that decorate 
the banks of the Red River. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he would do differently, TCU quarterback Max Knake snapped: "I'd 
probably stay out of the casinos before having to get up at 8:30 the next 
morning. . . . The truth of it is, I played terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Added defensive tackle Royal West: "We did a little too much seeing the town." 
</P>
<P>
 Groh's pivotal pass play gave Virginia a 17-3 lead with 9:08 left in the third 
period, and the Cavaliers overpowered TCU with the running of Charles Way and 
Kevin Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, who rushed for 114 yards, set up one touchdown with a 52-yard run and 
Way bulled in from the six-yard-line for the other in the first meeting between 
the Cavaliers of the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Southwest Conference 
co-champion Horned Frogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although playing without premier cornerback Ronde Barber, Virginia's powerful 
defense held the Frogs' explosive, balanced attack to a total of 195 yards.

NOT-SO-TIGHT END GETS DUCKS LOOSE; ROSE BOWL: OREGON'S JOSH WILCOX ISN'T REALLY 
DAFFY -- IT'S JUST HIS STYLE OF TRYING TO HAVE SOME FUN.

 What kind of Duck is Oregon sophomore tight end Josh Wilcox? 
</P>
<P>
 An odd Duck? 
</P>
<P>
 A wild Duck? 
</P>
<P>
 A daffy Duck? 
</P>
<P>
 He's certainly no dead Duck, not the way he has been acting lately. Start with 
the new tattoo on his left biceps. 
</P>
<P>
 The artwork is of a skull with a rose in its mouth. Above the skull are the 
words "Rose Bowl," and beneath it is "95." It's a pretty great tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what a lot of people thought," Wilcox said. "Except my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 And she learned about it by reading the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 It's quite a personality arsenal that Wilcox is bringing with him to Monday's 
Rose Bowl game against Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 In pads, Wilcox was the only 12-game starter for the Ducks' offense, catching 
19 passes for 293 yards and five touchdowns and throwing his body around on 
blocks like, well, some wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, that is precisely the job Wilcox would like to have. In fact, 
he's sort of upset that the team had to go to Disneyland the same day he could 
have witnessed the bouts on a professional wrestling card. 
</P>
<P>
 A sociology major, Wilcox set his sights on a career as a bodyguard after 
seeing Whitney Houston in "The Bodyguard," and quickly figuring it looked like 
pretty decent work. 
</P>
<P>
 But if he can't be a bodyguard or a wrestler, then Wilcox would just as soon 
hop on a motorcycle -- he covets a Harley-Davidson -- flex his tattoos, let the 
wind rush through his skull earrings and just take off. 
</P>
<P>
 If that Harley ever comes his way, Wilcox promises he'll head for North Dakota 
for the annual Harley rally. He said the event's appeal is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, that would be rad to go up there and hang out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any particular reasons?, 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a big leather jacket, killer boots and stuff. Yeah, you'd have fun, 
man. Fun, that's all it is." 
</P>
<P>
 And so the Rose Bowl welcomes Josh Wilcox, a decidedly loose end in search of 
fun. He's been finding it for a while now. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of former San Francisco 49er Dave Wilcox, Josh grew up in Junction 
City, Ore., about 20 minutes from Eugene, and was a prep football star. On 
weekends, he was a ball boy for Oregon games at Autzen Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the occasion of Oregon's first Rose Bowl appearance in 37 years, Wilcox 
promises not to be awed by the event. Wilcox plans to keep himself and his 
teammates loose, mainly just by being himself. 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates know what they're getting. Wilcox isn't just a live wire, he's 
an electrical substation. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon quarterback Danny O'Neil said Wilcox brings an entirely different 
dimension to the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "A kind of crazy, out-of-control attitude," said O'Neil, who also said that 
first impressions of Wilcox might be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "Josh starts going crazy, the first time you see it, you probably think he's 
loony. But you understand, it's just his style." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilcox method of teammate inspiration is not yet patented. However, it 
apparently is effective, usually involving yelling and going semi-berserk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love it," O'Neil said. "He puts on a show. He may look like he's out of 
control, but he knows what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, sometimes not. Take the time Wilcox fell on his backside as O'Neil called 
the snap at a crucial moment in the Oregon State game. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Wilcox, Josh's father, was at the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry Baker asked me what invisible man knocked Josh backward," the elder 
Wilcox said." 
</P>
<P>
 Josh said he had been sick and his equilibrium was off, but others weren't so 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some rumor got started that I passed out," he said. "I went, 'Yeah, that 
happened.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But one play later, Dino Philyaw scored for the Ducks to put the game away. It 
was a scoring play Wilcox took credit for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I set it up with my awesome ability to be unbalanced," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Few may argue that point. In Rose Bowl-mad Eugene, the Wilcox brand of 
personally controlled hysteria seems to be playing just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to figure how an Oregon victory would go over in Eugene because 
merely being in the game has been so big already. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could I describe it?" Wilcox said. "Well, if we ever achieve world peace, 
that would be close, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Josh is busy being Josh. He tools around town in his 1985 
Chevy Blazer and when he isn't practicing football or driving, he watches 
television at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I'm a bum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for tattoos, well, he's got the skull and he already had a snake on the 
other arm, so Wilcox has sort of run out of arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he thinks too much is being made out of his tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I'm not going to be some tattoo artist or anything," he said. "I just 
kind of like skulls." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox packed his Harley tie and his skull earrings for team functions this 
week, although he said he doesn't really feel comfortable dressing up because 
it makes him feel like a banker. 
</P>
<P>
 He also briefly considered, then rejected, dyeing his hair, a la Dennis 
Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to look halfway decent," Wilcox explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course. But please, Wilcox said, don't get the wrong idea about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people get to know me, they know that I'm not like this serial killer or 
anything," he said. "It's just me. I'm just having fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy asked me if this was a big act, my personality. An act for what? I'm 
living my life and enjoying what I'm doing. This team . . . I guess it's easy 
to stick out like a sore thumb." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides that, nobody wants to beat Penn State more than he does, said Wilcox, 
who rates Joe Paterno second only to Bear Bryant on college football coaching's 
list of greatness. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes in the free spirit business, where occasional bursts of 
normality occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Wilcox told Paul Buker of the (Portland) Oregonian he thought it was 
funny when he read a newspaper quote from Josh, who said he wanted to be free 
to "swim with sharks." 
</P>
<P>
 Said the elder Wilcox: "It's more like playing with the guppies." 
</P>
<P>
 But Josh said that was just his father being playful with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad doesn't like to think I'm weird," Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 What we appear to have here is somebody heavily involved in the pursuit of 
happiness and asking for a Harley to help close the gap.

THE BOWLS DAILY REPORT; SUGAR FLORIDA VS. FLORIDA STATE, MONDAY; BONUSES NOT 
ALL THEY APPEAR TO BE 
</P>

<P>
 Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden woke up in trouble Wednesday when wife Ann 
read in the New Orleans Times-Picayune that he was receiving an $86,250 bonus 
for getting the Seminoles into the Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife sure checked that out," Bowden said and laughed."Ann thought I was 
holding out on her." 
</P>
<P>
 Most coaches have clauses in their contracts giving them bonuses for bowl 
appearances, and Bowden's involves anywhere from half a month to two months 
salary, depending on the bowl payout. As it turns out, the paper used 
information from other sources that had done some math involving his total -- 
rather than base -- compensation, which is about $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As with most coaches at major state universities, Bowden's contract is heavily 
skewed toward television and radio money, with only about $105,000 in base 
salary. Bowden's bonus will be about $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida Coach Steve Spurrier's bonus was reported to be $75,000; he'll get 
$13,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spurrier on the Nov. 26 game at Tallahassee in which the Gators blew a 31-3 
lead when Florida State scored 28 fourth-quarter points in a 31-31 tie: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was glad they decided to tie it up because I'm not sure we could have 
stopped the two-point conversion at that point. . . . It looked like there was 
no way we could have stopped them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden has been criticized for having Dan Mowrey kick an extra point to tie 
the score after Rock Preston's four-yard touchdown run. Bowden's logic: The 
Seminoles had come from too far behind to take a chance on losing. JIM HODGES

 Ohio State Coach John Cooper is getting a bit cranky over some of his players 
leaving school early for the NFL draft. This season he lost Dan Wilkinson, the 
No. 1 pick overall, to Cincinnati.Big Daddy, who played more like Big Dud this 
season, followed in the spike marks of Alonzo Spellman (1991), Robert Smith 
(1992) and Roger Harper (1992), all of whom came out early. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Korey Springer, a two-time All-American tackle, and linebackers 
Lorenzo Styles and Craig Powell are considering leaving early. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer would probably be a first-round pick with the others farther down. 
</P>
<P>
 "What bothers me is that every NFL person I talk to says a kid ought to stay," 
Cooper said. "Well, if they really believe that, why do they draft him?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper is hoping that the holiday season and mandatory attraction visits don't 
take the edge off his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the hardest thing is to balance having a good time and to also have 
the timing for practice," Cooper said. "We came down here to play a game. The 
game is the attraction." JOHN CHERWA

 The game at Tucson between No. 22 Brigham Young (9-3) and Oklahoma (6-5) is 
about an arrival, a departure and a possible departure. 
</P>
<P>
 The new face on the scene is Oklahoma quarterback Terence Brown, a sophomore 
who hasn't taken a snap in a game since Oct. 22.He gets the start because 
Garrick McGee is too weak to play after a bout with meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
 The game will be the last for Oklahoma Coach Gary Gibbs. Gibbs, 44-22-2 in six 
seasons, announced his resignation Nov. 21 and is now a lame duck -- his 
successor, Howard Schnellenberger, was named the new coach Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The Copper Bowl might be the last game for BYU quarterback John Walsh, who 
reportedly will head for the NFL.

THE BOWLS DAILY REPORT; COTTON / USC VS. TEXAS TECH, MONDAY; RILEY ON HIS WAY

 USC offensive coordinator Mike Riley was expected to confer again with 
Vanderbilt Athletic Director Paul Hoolahan late Wednesday, fueling speculation 
he might be the leading candidate for the school's vacant head coaching job.  
</P>
<P>
 He was first interviewed Monday when the Trojans arrived in Dallas.It's 
believed the three top candidates are Riley, Cleveland Brown quarterback coach 
Rod Dowhower and Nebraska assistant Frank Solich.  
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates include Marshall University's Jim Donnan, William & Mary's 
Jimmye Laycock, Florida assistant John Reaves, former Houston Oiler assistant 
Kevin Gilbride and Vandy assistants Don Frease and Carl Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening was created when Gerry DiNardo resigned to become the Louisiana 
State coach after posting a four-year 18-26 mark.  
</P>
<P>
 Riley, 41, is in his second year at USC.

 Texas Tech linebacker Zach Thomas on his team's record: 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think we don't need to go to a bowl with a 6-5 record. It's not a 
good record. I didn't want to go with it, either. I wanted to go to the Cotton 
Bowl, but I didn't want to be 6-5.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Lord blessed us by putting us in this position by putting (Texas) 
A&M on probation. A&M, they cheated so they deserved to be put on probation."

A COACH WHO LEADS THEM LAUGHING; COTTON BOWL: IF GOOD HUMOR WON GAMES, SPIKE 
DYKES' TEXAS TECH WOULD BE FAVORED OVER USC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Texas Tech and its football coach, Spike Dykes, are a perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Born not far from the campus in Lubbock and raised in Oasis near the New 
Mexico border, Dykes is the son of a cotton ginner and spent his internship as 
a high school coach in West Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the population of Oasis, he said, "Four. It was six when I was 
growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining why he likes living in Lubbock, he said, "There's not much smog or 
crime. There's also not much traffic. If I leave campus at 5, I get home in 
eight minutes. If I leave at 4, I get home in three minutes. And I live quite a 
ways away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where I come from, if somebody says hello to you, you don't just keep 
walking, you say, 'Hello, how ya doin'?" 
</P>
<P>
 After a loss to Nebraska, he described the Cornhuskers as being "bigger than 
Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the Cornhuskers "ground our corn." 
</P>
<P>
 Dykes, whose given name is William, was nicknamed for a Dick Tracy character. 
He and USC Coach John Robinson should put some levity into what normally are 
boring pregame news conferences this week in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykes, 55, is also hoping that his team can give the Trojans a lively debate 
in the Cotton Bowl on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech and the Cotton Bowl have not exactly been synonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Raiders' only appearance in the game was in 1939 when St. Mary's 
defeated them, 20-13. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Raiders haven't been much more prominent in football than the 
Galloping Gaels the last few decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Tech had seven consecutive losing seasons from 1979-85 until Coach David 
McWilliams, in a brief stay before bolting for Texas, compiled a 7-4 
regular-season record in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykes replaced McWilliams before the Independence Bowl, a loss to Mississippi. 
In 1989, Dykes coached the Red Raiders to a 9-3 record, but all three defeats 
were in Southwest Conference games and they finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 The past four years have been virtual carbon copies -- 6-5, 5-6, 6-6 and 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Easily the best team in the SWC this season was Texas A&M, which was 10-0-1 
overall and 6-0-1 in the conference. But the Aggies are on probation, meaning 
no bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech, which tied with four others for the title at 4-3, got the Cotton 
bid in the next-to-last season of the Southwest Conference because they've been 
away from the game longer than Baylor, Texas, TCU or Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long wait," Dykes said. "I don't mind people talking about how we 
backed in (by losing to TCU in the final regular-season game), just as long as 
they give us some credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cotton Bowl is the ultimate for us. It's a great privilege and an honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense is the name of the game for Dykes, who leaves most of the offensive 
strategy to his coordinator, Dick Winder. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Winder's Abilene Cooper High team was 4-6, but upset Dykes' Midland 
Lee team that went to the Class 5A state finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykes also has a close relationship with his running backs coach -- his son, 
Rick. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Raiders have limited five of their 11 opponents to nine or fewer 
points, but haven't faced a team that can pass like USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Their greatest accomplishment might have been coming within 14-9 of top-ranked 
Nebraska early in the third quarter in September at Lubbock before caving in, 
42-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got a good, active defense and you know they're going to be playing 
with tremendous enthusiasm," Robinson said. "This is a huge game for their 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech quickly sold out its allotment of 20,000 tickets and gobbled up the 
7,000 or so USC couldn't sell of its 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to suggest that 6-5 goes over that big even in Lubbock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you lose 10% of your friends every year," Dykes said at the start of 
the season. "I've been on the Tech staff for 10 years, so mom and my dog is 
about all I got left."

 Penn State kicker Brett Conway dedicates his kicks to Chuck Mize, his high 
school coach in Lilburn, Ga., who was slain during Conway's senior year. "A lot 
of my decision to attend Penn State was based on what he thought," Conway 
said."He thought it was a good place for me, and I guess it's safe to say he 
was proud that he had a player who went to play for Joe Paterno and Penn 
State." 
</P>
<P>
 Mize never saw Conway kick for the Nittany Lions. He was stabbed to death by 
his 24-year-old son, Chip, in his suburban Atlanta home in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Conway made 10 of 12 field-goal attempts, plus 62 conversions for 92 points, 
second on the team to Ki-Jana Carter's 138.

 Four Penn State players are sons of players on the undefeated teams of 
1968-69. Tony Pittman's father, Charlie, was an All-American back in 1969. Andy 
and Matt Joyner's father, Dave, was offensive captain in 1971 after playing on 
the '69 team. Todd Kulka's father, John, lettered three years and was offensive 
captain in 1968. SHAV GLICK

QUARTERBACK DECISION TODAY

 Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said the decision on who will start at quarterback 
for Sunday's game -- Tommie Frazier or Brook Berringer -- was made after 
Wednesday's practice. But Osborne said he won't make a public announcement 
until today. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne said Frazier and Berringer will play against the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier, who hasn't played since Sept. 24 because of a blood clot in his right 
calf, is 4-0 as a starter. Berringer, his replacement, is 7-0. Matt Turman, who 
filled in for Berringer, is 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne said he will choose a starter based on practice performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really no fair situation," Frazier said. "I think that's as fair as 
it's going to get."

 Contrary to earlier reports, the Orange Bowl game doesn't move to nearby Joe 
Robbie Stadium until 1997. Unfortunately, nobody told Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that's great about this game . . . is that the last Orange Bowl in 
the Orange Bowl is going to have the University of Miami playing, so that's 
kind of special to us as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An honest mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with the new bowl alliance taking effect next season, there will be 
changes. No longer will the Big Eight Conference (soon to be Big 12) champion 
earn an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl, as it has since 1976. With the 
exception of the Big Ten and Pacific 10, all conference affiliations with the 
major bowls will cease. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new three-year arrangement, the Fiesta, Sugar and Orange bowls will 
take turns putting together the best possible game. The Fiesta Bowl will get 
first selection next season. GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI

 After the big buildup for his senior season, Michigan's big-play running back 
Tyrone Wheatley could only equal last season's statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the odd thing. He rushed for 1,064 yards and 11 touchdowns each 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley might have surpassed last season's total had he not missed Michigan's 
first two games because of a leg injury. Still, he was not disappointed with 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to sound cocky, I like odds, I like to overcome them," he said. "I'm 
happy. A lot of guys couldn't even wear my shoes (considering) what I've been 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on course, I followed the road and I did everything I was supposed to. I 
didn't leave any rocks unturned." ELLIOTT ALMOND

TV RATINGS GIVE FREEDOM OFFICIALS A LIFT; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NUMBERS COME AS 
RELIEF TO BOWL ORGANIZERS, WHO WERE DISAPPOINTED WITH ATTENDANCE FOR THE 
UTAH-ARIZONA GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Attendance for Tuesday night's Freedom Bowl wasn't good, but preliminary 
television ratings for Utah's 16-13 victory over Arizona in Anaheim Stadium 
provided a boost to a game whose future remains cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom Bowl XI drew an overnight Nielsen rating of 3.0, which computes to 
roughly 28.4 million U.S. households. That's almost half a point higher than 
the average Freedom Bowl rating of 2.6, and Ken Haines, executive vice 
president of the Raycom Network, said the final rating could go as high as 3.4. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's very encouraging, a very positive sign," said Don Andersen, executive 
director of the Orange County Sports Assn., which promotes and operates the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 But is it enough for Raycom to extend its contract to televise the game? 
Raycom's five-year deal, which paid the Freedom Bowl $400,000 per year, has 
expired, and Haines said his Charlotte, N.C.-based company, which has 
experienced "marginal returns" with the Freedom Bowl, will decide in the next 
30 days whether to renew. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll look at ratings, what the total advertising revenue was, and we'll 
determine whether we'll continue with that bowl," said Haines, whose company 
owns and operates the Carquest Bowl. "These ratings should give them a lift, 
but it will be a financial decision." 
</P>
<P>
 It's one that will have a direct impact on the future of the Freedom Bowl, 
which can't survive without a television contract. But even if Raycom pulls the 
plug, Andersen said he's confident he could secure another television deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an inquiring call from ESPN a few months ago, and we've also had 
conversations with the Turner Network and even ABC in the past few years," 
Andersen said. "We'll explore all options." 
</P>
<P>
 One option Raycom is exploring is purchasing the game from the OCSA, as it did 
with the Carquest Bowl five years ago, and running all aspects of the event, 
from television to concessions to parking, advertising and sponsorships. 
</P>
<P>
 Haines said there's "no more than a 50-50 chance" of that happening, and if 
Raycom did purchase the Freedom Bowl, the game "would probably move" out of 
Anaheim, which also lost the Pigskin Classic this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Raycom source who asked not to be identified said buying the game is "a 
real longshot. It's not going to make a lot of sense, because it wouldn't be 
that profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen said "there's nothing to that (Raycom buying the game) at all," but 
he did say the OCSA Executive Committee would soon meet do discuss ways to 
increase Freedom Bowl attendance -- Tuesday's crowd of 27,477 was the smallest 
since the inaugural game in 1984. One option is reducing ticket prices, which 
are $18 and $30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe ticket price is one factor," Andersen said. "Maybe we should have an 
end zone section for $5. Those are the kinds of things we'll review."

SAILER: MVP WITH FOOTNOTE; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: WITH HIS SELECTION AS DIVISION 
III CO-PLAYER OF YEAR, NOTRE DAME KICKER GIVES CONVENTION THE BOOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kickers are an integral part of football, to be sure, but rarely does one rate 
as player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Sailer of Notre Dame High is an exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailer and Westlake receiver Billy Miller were named the Southern Section 
Division III co-players of the year. Hart junior running back Ted Iacenda, who 
scored an area-record 41 touchdowns this season, earned the honor in Division 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 In setting a state single-season record of 22 field goals, Sailer also tied 
the career mark of 33; Miller is a top NCAA Division I prospect who caught 67 
passes for 1,057 yards and 14 touchdowns. The pair are among 13 area players 
named to the Division III team. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailer, who made all 39 of his extra points, is no ordinary kicker. He 
converted seven of 11 field-goal attempts from 50 yards or beyond and was named 
to the All-USA football team selected by USA Today. Nonetheless, the Division 
III honor came as a surprise to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shocks me because I really don't do that much," Sailer said. "You see the 
players out there with blood on them and dirt, and then there's me with the 
nice clean uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda, the Indians' leading rusher and receiver with a combined 2,376 yards, 
is joined by 14 other area players on the Division II team. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley -- a 36-15 winner over the Indians in the championship game -- 
and Hart each had four players named to the Division II team. Antelope Valley 
is represented by junior running back Jermaine Lewis, senior defensive lineman 
Caleb Smith, senior defensive back Chad Murphy and senior punter Chad Shrout. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart boasts junior quarterback Steve McKeon, senior offensive lineman Ryan 
Schienle and junior linebacker Marc Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the Division II team are senior offensive linemen Mark Manskar of 
Canyon and Mike Martin of Quartz Hill, senior defensive lineman Matt Gillis of 
Saugus, senior linebackers Lawrence Larry of Littlerock and Chris Hedrick of 
Crescenta Valley, and senior defensive backs Carlos Baker of Burbank and Damein 
Kendrid )of Quartz Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division III, senior receiver Robbie Brewster, senior defensive lineman 
Edgar Nava and senior linebacker David Dupetit of Notre Dame all earned 
distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 The other eight area players in Division III include junior running back Jason 
Giovannettone of Chaminade, senior all-purpose player Craig Walendy of 
Westlake, senior offensive linemen John Raymond of Buena, Steve Zirnite of 
Royal and Chadd Kahlsdorf of Ventura, and senior linebackers Eric Guenther of 
Westlake, Nathan Coyle of Buena and Brian Kavanagh of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi senior quarterback Dave Lins and senior offensive lineman Kane Cullum 
were named to the Division I team.

AT A CROSSROADS; ELEAZAR HERNANDEZ MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN COLLEGE OR A RETURN HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleazar Hernandez likes to do his thinking on the move. His mind wanders while 
his body strides purposefully, enabling him to withstand the ache in his gut 
and the burn in his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross-country runners endure considerable pain, and they have considerable 
time to think. Hernandez, one of the nation's best high school runners, has 
been deep in thought lately during his training runs through the dusty 
agricultural fields around Camarillo High. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a clear and direct route to becoming a champion, he is a runner 
at a crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
 One direction points home, to a small town in central Mexico where after 
graduating from Camarillo in June, he can rejoin his family and begin a career 
as a mechanic or carpenter. These thoughts are comforting yet uninspiring. 
</P>
<P>
 The other direction points to a certain Division I cross-country scholarship, 
a college education and four more years as enriching as the past four. These 
thoughts are exciting yet intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 Which will be best in the long run? 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss my family and they expect me back. But everyone here says I have a 
great opportunity and that I should go to college," says Hernandez, who lives 
with his oldest brother's family in Oxnard. His parents, three brothers and a 
sister remain in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 He whistles softly through his teeth as if to underscore his anguish. "I don't 
know," he says. "I have to think some more." 
</P>
<P>
 Only crossroads cause Hernandez discomfort. When he knows where the finish 
line is, gangway, he's comin' through with a trademark bandanna on his head and 
determination in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, 17, placed fifth in the Foot Locker national championships Dec. 10 
to cap a superb senior cross-country season. He finished first in the Southern 
Section Division I championships and also won the team sweepstakes race of the 
prestigious Mt. San Antonio College Invitational in October. 
</P>
<P>
 He also finished second in the state Division I final and was fourth in the 
West regional to qualify for the nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the most consistent runner in California without a doubt," says Mike 
Smith, Camarillo's cross-country and track coach. "He is tremendously 
courageous. He runs well whether he feels good or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, 5 feet 6, 130 pounds, will take a trip to the University of Texas, 
San Antonio, in January and Smith says several other schools are hot on the 
runner's trail. 
</P>
<P>
 But where does the trail lead? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez is on the move once again. The familiar pain is present. Still, he 
puts one foot in front of the other in a graceful cadence, running, running, 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 He reaches Camarillo High and checks his watch. Eleven miles in 75 minutes, 
not bad carrying a backpack full of books, he says to himself. He removes the 
hefty pack from his shoulders and notices welts caused by the chafing straps 
and bouncing books. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez shrugs and ducks into his first-period class. His perfect-attendance 
record remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey Coach, you're not gonna believe what Eleazar did this morning." A 
Camarillo sprinter informs Smith how his top runner made it to school after 
missing his usual ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith examines the welts on Hernandez's back and tells him to skip practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, Coach, I want to run," Hernandez insists, and he takes off with his 
teammates on a seven-mile run. 
</P>
<P>
 Running, running, running. Thinking, thinking, thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is such an honorable person," Smith says. "His courage is incredible, and 
he has kindness that you just don't see in people anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Adalberto Sanchez of Capistrano Valley High, another of the state's top 
runners, will never forget Hernandez's graciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 At the West regional meet in Fresno last month, the starter's gun did not fire 
correctly, causing Sanchez to stumble beyond the starting line. He stood there 
bewildered, unable to squeeze back into the surging pack of runners who had 
pushed forward to the front row. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the gun went off, Sanchez felt a hand grab his shoulder and pull him 
back across the starting line, right into the front row. Hernandez stepped back 
into the second row and released his grip on Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eleazar had only beaten him by one second in the CIF finals two weeks 
earlier, and here he is helping the guy by giving up his spot on the front 
row," Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez is perfectly willing to sacrifice his own best interests to do what 
he considers honorable. He will forgo a college education if he believes his 
family needs him in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The brother Eleazar lives with, Victor, has managed well during his nine years 
in the United States. Victor is 27, married with two young children, and works 
full-time in an Oxnard factory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my dad maybe would want (Eleazar) to go (to college)," Victor says, 
"but I don't know about my mother. I do know they expect him back after high 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Eleazar reflects on his family and his whistle is barely audible. He realizes 
he has outdistanced his expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was always my plan, four years here then I go back," he says. "But now, 
there are questions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was simply family tradition. After finishing eighth grade in Mexico, 
Hernandez was to work full-time in a factory like his father and two brothers 
had done. No one in his family had attended high school. 
</P>
<P>
 But a visit from Victor brought Eleazar to the first crossroads of his life. 
Victor had lived in the United States for five years and he urged his younger 
brother to return with him and attend high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was curious, so I went," Hernandez says. 
</P>
<P>
 He enrolled at Fillmore High, a pudgy 160-pound freshman who spoke no English. 
His role models were gang members. Hernandez didn't even know how to run from 
trouble, let alone run cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the gang members were also runners, so Hernandez tried out for the 
team. To his surprise, he enjoyed it. And as he ran off excess weight, he 
excelled, finishing the cross-country season as the varsity's No. 3 runner. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez had found a sport, a home and some homeboys. The United States was 
all right. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer, however, Victor married and moved to Camarillo, dragging 
with him a very unhappy Eleazar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my brother to send me back to Mexico, but he didn't have any money," 
Hernandez says, scowling at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez enrolled at Camarillo and decided to do what he does best: Run 
through the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 He grew close to Smith and assistant Charlie Carranza, taking long runs with 
Carranza after school. Hernandez left his gang affiliations in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
 His English improved rapidly, thanks to Pasqual Campos, a Camarillo teacher. 
Hernandez now speaks nearly fluent English and takes a full schedule of 
English-speaking classes. 
</P>
<P>
 As his running times went down, his grade-point average went up. Hernandez, 
who has a personal best of 9 minutes 10.96 seconds in the 3,200 meters, 
currently is earning four A's and two C's. "Math and biology still give me 
trouble," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor and his family moved to Oxnard last year, but Eleazar chose to remain 
at Camarillo High, a decision that was a jog around the block compared to the 
one he faces now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez was honored on a recent evening by the Mexican-American Forum of 
Camarillo. He met a judge, an attorney and several businessmen who, like 
Hernandez, became more educated than anyone in their families. 
</P>
<P>
 He was encouraged to give college a try, a refrain he heard from all sides. 
Part of his reluctance is a fear of the unknown. It did not stop him from 
coming to the United States, but it might keep him from staying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear in college you have to do homework until midnight," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip to San Antonio should help him get a clear idea of what college life 
holds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez will take the Scholastic Aptitude Test in January and if his score 
is over the 700 required for an athletic scholarship, "I think he will go to 
college," Smith says. "I think it is looking more like that every day." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, he will be able to visit his family first. To attend college in the 
United States, Hernandez must return to Mexico and apply for a foreign student 
visa. The fact that he has been offered an athletic scholarship makes approval 
of the visa a near certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've encouraged him to go to college," Victor Hernandez says. "It's a great 
opportunity that none of us in our family has had. I would be so proud." 
</P>
<P>
 So would Smith, although he will support any decision Hernandez makes. He 
points out that returning to Mexico for good does not spell an end to the 
runner's career. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are club teams that train in a very competitive track and field 
environment," Smith says. "Many great runners come from Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez being one of them. Now he is being told to stop . . . and make a 
choice that will transform his life. 
</P>
<P>
 More than likely, he won't stop at all. This decision will be made on the run, 
somewhere along a flat road on the Oxnard plains, with Hernandez running and 
thinking, thinking and running.

LOS ALAMITOS; PLANO NOT SULKY ABOUT RETURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After being the leading trainer and driver at the Los Alamitos harness meeting 
that closed last March, Rick Plano uprooted his family and moved to Vernon, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Although wife Mary Ann and son Luke, 14, didn't mind the move, daughter Erika, 
16, did not want to leave California. But because of the lack of harness racing 
in the state from April through December, Plano had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started racing right where I originally started," said Plano, a New York 
native, of Vernon Downs. "It's a nice facility, with a good atmosphere and good 
management." 
</P>
<P>
 Plano, 43, also raced in New Jersey before deciding to move back to California 
when the three-month Los Alamitos meeting, which begins tonight, was announced. 
Despite complaints from his daughter, who now didn't want to leave New York, 
Plano moved his family and his 30-horse stable west for the winter, arriving on 
Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was getting a little bit cold back there," he said. "In my opinion, and in 
the opinion of many other trainers and drivers, the best place to race is on 
the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
 Plano said the California weather is ideal for training and racing, especially 
in winter. California also offers less competition because of fewer racetracks 
and a smaller number of horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very nice place to race here, and people take it for granted," 
Plano said. "If we don't continue things after this meeting, this may be the 
last time around. If we don't keep something going year round, this may be the 
end of California harness racing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Plano is optimistic about the Los Alamitos meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's going to be a very successful meeting," he said. "There are a 
larger number of horses than the 1994 season. A lot of people came back that 
they didn't expect to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Plano stable is well prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have a good bunch of horses," he said. "The people that own them are 
a quality bunch of people. My horses are all in good shape. I have a powerful 
stable, at least as strong as anyone who is out here now." 
</P>
<P>
 Plano's stable includes Keepyourpantson, a 4-year-old pacer who was a top 
stakes performer in past years at Los Alamitos. Keepyourpantson qualified last 
Friday, winning his race in 2:00 4/5 for the mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Plano also speaks highly of Camraderie, who has a personal record of 1:52 4/5 
over a mile course. Plano expects the 7-year-old pacer to qualify this week. 
Another Plano horse to watch is Carmel By The Sea, named after Plano's mother, 
Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
 Plano said his mother regularly gets race programs shipped from California to 
her home in Frankfurt, N.Y. The mare Plano chose to name after his mother might 
make her proud this year, as she qualified at Los Alamitos in 1:59 4/5 last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Plano's strong stable should help him in his title defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate being in the top three (in the standings)," said Plano, who has 
been in the top five as a trainer or driver for 10 of the 14 years he has raced 
in California. "I sure hope to be close (to the leading trainer and driver 
titles.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Harness Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The first post today is 6:45 p.m. With each paid admission, patrons will 
receive a free grandstand admission pass for the remainder of the meeting. The 
first week, racing will be tonight and Friday, with no racing on Saturday. 
Starting next week, racing will continue Thursday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three simulcasts from the Meadowlands in New Jersey will precede the nine-race 
live card at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Premiere Group, which operates the Los Alamitos harness meeting, has announced 
some changes from last year's meeting. The most notable is the merging of 
simulcast pools with The Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, simulcast pools averaged $47,000 per race. This year, with the 
merger, simulcast pools should jump to approximately $250,000 per race. 
</P>
<P>
 Racing secretary Dave Goldschmidt has received 680 stall applications from 
horsemen, and expects at least 500 horses to be on the grounds by late this 
week.

 Chuck Osborne said he expects to be haunted this off-season, despite his 
brilliant performance in Tuesday's Freedom Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2, 255-pound junior from Canyon High had two sacks for Arizona 
during a defensive battle against Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne, who narrowly missed getting two more sacks, made several key plays 
and spent most of the evening in quarterback Mike McCoy's face as Arizona, 
which lost, 16-13, held the Utes to 75 yards of total offense. 
</P>
<P>
 But he will be plagued by Utah's answered prayer: a five-yard touchdown pass 
from McCoy to Kevin Dyson on fourth down with 3 minutes 34 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning touchdown came on the heels of Steve McLaughlin's 20-yard field 
goal, which gave the Wildcats a 13-7 lead, a safety, which made it 13-9, and a 
72-yard return by Utah's Cal Beck of the free kick that followed the safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Had this been the NFL, McCoy would have been ruled "in the grasp" on his 
touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne was riding McCoy to the turf at the 12 when the Ute quarterback flung 
the ball blindly toward the end zone and Dyson made a lunging, one-handed 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know he got the ball off," Osborne said. "I thought I sacked him. I 
saw the crowd cheering. I thought he was down. Then I saw the receiver had the 
ball. That was devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Osborne blames himself for not making an extraordinary play, for not 
taking the ball out of McCoy's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just going for the tackle and not the turnover," he said. "They 
emphasize stripping the ball. And I take fault in that. I feel really bad about 
that. It's on me, and I'll never forget this." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Wildcat defense dominated the game, holding the Utes to a net six 
yards rushing, Osborne had three tackles for a loss and broke up two passes. 
Osborne, who led Arizona in sacks (13) and tied for the team lead in tackles 
for losses (18), had deflected a McCoy pass intended for Dyson two plays 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 So how would Osborne label this Utah triumph? 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne cocked his head, looked at the locker-room ceiling and paused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Preposterous," he said. "It was the most unpredictable game I've ever been 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Weird to bizarre: The McCoy-to-Dyson pass was weird, but Ontiwaun Carter's 
23-yard touchdown reception for Arizona in the first quarter was bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
 It actually could have been ruled an interception and fumble recovery, with 
the senior running back from Kennedy High stealing the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, running a fly pattern, was well covered by Utah cornerback Edwin 
Garrette. Garrette leaped and snared quarterback Dan White's underthrown pass, 
but as Garrette fell backward at the one-yard line -- arms stretched above his 
head, ball in hands -- Carter stripped it and trotted across the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just pulled it out and said, 'This is mine,' Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, Arizona's all-time leading rusher with 3,501 yards, thought the 
rushing yardage would come easier after that. He was wrong. He struggled for 44 
yards in 19 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "(After the touchdown) I was thinking, 'OK, we got the pass. Now we can open 
it up a little bit,' " he said. " 'All we need now is for our offensive line to 
control the line of scrimmage and it'll be over.' But, as you can see, our 
offensive line struggled." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No Dice: Blame it on poor blocking. Blame it on dropped passes. But when it 
mattered most, Arizona's offense (184 total yards) was just as shackled as 
Utah's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats could have put the game away with a touchdown midway through the 
fourth quarter, but tight end Tim Thomas and wide receiver Lamar Lovett dropped 
easy passes in the end zone. The question is, where was Richard Dice? 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-3, 215-pound sophomore from Alemany who caught 63 passes for 1,034 yards 
(the second-highest single-season total in school history) had only one 
reception in the second half after catching six for 61 yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plays were there for me," he said. "I don't know what happened. I thought 
this was going to be a big night for me. But they were in (White's) face the 
whole night." 
</P>
<P>
 Where was Dice when White was looking for some good hands in the end zone? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was open (on the second dropped attempt), but I wasn't as open as Lamar 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Smigiel, Arizona's 6-5, 285-pound senior tackle from Newbury Park, might 
have summed it up best. 
</P>
<P>
 "You gotta catch the rock," he said. "We catch the rock, we win." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A grateful Ute: Utah wide receiver Curtis Marsh (Simi Valley/Moorpark College) 
wasn't looking a gift horse in the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a blessing to win this game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-2, 209-pound senior, who had 61 receptions for 851 yards and tied for 
the Western Athletic Conference lead in touchdown receptions with 11 during the 
regular season, was held to three receptions for 25 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Arizona) forced me to the inside," said Marsh, who prefers sideline routes. 
"Really, their defense played all-around good ball. Nothing was working for us. 
We were either covered, or (McCoy) didn't have enough time." 
</P>
<P>
 The play before Dyson's decisive catch, McCoy looked for Marsh, who was well 
covered, and the quarterback was forced to throw out of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh said he had the best seat in the house to watch the reception. He was 
roving at the back of the end zone behind Dyson and said he might have been 
able to make the catch himself.

THE COLLEGES / MIKE HISERMAN; CAL STATE VENTURA'S HOOP GRUNIONS SHOULD SURVIVE 
SWIMMINGLY

<P>
 'Tis the season for wishful thinking and future forecasting, so, with that in 
mind, we might as well go big. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Major developments out west this week. After a search spanning more than three 
decades, a site deemed suitable for a new California State University campus 
has been located near Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's first public four-year university will be born just as soon 
as a couple of bugs are worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing major. All that's needed is money. Seems as though the state 
university system has enough cash stashed away to purchase the land, but not 
enough in reserve to build a campus on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Details, details. 
</P>
<P>
 Better work it out, folks. The good people of Ventura have been waiting too 
long for an alternative between Cal State Northridge and UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 They want their horizons expanded. They want their arts, literature and 
entertainment right along with their English 101. 
</P>
<P>
 And they want their Runnin' Grunion. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, the Cal State Ventura Runnin' Grunion. 
</P>
<P>
 The basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Soaring Seagulls? 
</P>
<P>
 Flying Fish? 
</P>
<P>
 Again, details, details. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is, Cal State Ventura is an NCAA Division I power just waiting to be 
hatched. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, an alternative to the rodeos over at the Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark these words: The Grunion will be thoroughbreds in a previously no-horse 
town. Just look at what's happened with the Ventura College men's basketball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, Coach Philip (don't call him Phil) Mathews and his troupe jam fans into 
the aisles of their old junior college gym just to watch a midnight practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Make it major-college hoops and the masses multiply. 
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it, CSV should plan on hiring Mathews. He has roots in the 
area, has previous major-college experience as an assistant coach and is a 
proven recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
 Year in and year out his bunch is among the top juco crews in the state. Truth 
be told, there have been years -- including this one -- when the Pirates could 
sink at least a few of the nation's 302 existing Division I ships. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say Mathews could do it alone. He would need a full complement 
of scholarships and, ideally, a tidy little 5,000-seat arena/student 
recreational resort with which to lure, er, attract players. 
</P>
<P>
 They could call it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Sandcastle. 
</P>
<P>
 Goes right along with any of the nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
 Gotta stick with beach themes, though. Anything that inspires visions of the 
surf, sand and other natural beauties of the Central Coast. Just makes it that 
much easier for the basketball coaches to lure, er, attract, players from the 
frozen blacktops of Chicago and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Notice we keep mentioning basketball? 
</P>
<P>
 These days colleges need a marquee sport to hang their hats on. 
</P>
<P>
 Some choose football. Others -- the smart ones -- pick basketball. It's less 
expensive and a team needs fewer top players to immediately become competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, future Cal State Ventura officials will learn a lesson from 
the mistakes of their sister school to the east, Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is in its fifth year of competition at Division I. In the late 
'80s, when school officials announced their decision to raise every sport but 
football from Division II status, they almost simultaneously unveiled plans for 
a proposed 20,000-seat football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Conflicting signals. At Northridge, it's a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teams have overcome. The men's and women's volleyball, baseball and 
softball teams at Northridge are considered among the best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like the winless women's basketball team, have been overrun. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's men's basketball team has struggled but generally has remained 
competitive. Once in a while the Matadors pop up and bite a decent team like 
Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But Northridge still plays in a facility that can best be compared to a 
typical high school gym. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Northridge football program, still no stadium. And now there's not 
even a billboard trumpeting a future stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Those plans have collapsed, as has the team, which lately has been mired in 
losing seasons and embroiled in off-the-field controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 But enough about Northridge.  
</P>
<P>
 As far as Ventura goes, maybe we're getting a little ahead of ourselves. 
Bureaucracy within the state system being what it is, the school probably won't 
exist until the next millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now there aren't any administrators around to plan. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, however, architects, and to those folks one final word to the wise: 
Don't build the Sandcastle over an earthquake fault.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK; SCC'S COOPER WORKING TO OVERCOME 
SETBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Basketball wasn't much of a priority for Southern California College women's 
basketball Coach Dean Cooper during much of November. 
</P>
<P>
 The week of the Vanguards' season opener, Cooper got word that his 82-year-old 
father, Albert, had suffered a stroke. So Cooper left assistant coach Randy 
Hawkins in charge of the team and headed to Leadwood, Mo., a small town south 
of St. Louis, to be near his father. 
</P>
<P>
 During Cooper's 2 1/2 weeks in Missouri, his father died. Cooper took it hard, 
but upon his return quickly got back into basketball -- probably too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 After one day of practice, he and the Vanguards went to the Golden State 
Athletic Conference Preseason tournament in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad and I really were close; he was my fishing buddy," Cooper said. "It 
took an awful lot out of me, and when I came back my wife asked me not to go to 
Fresno because I wasn't ready physically or emotionally and after I got back I 
wished I hadn't gone." 
</P>
<P>
 In Fresno, the Vanguards were swept, losing to Concordia, Fresno Pacific and 
Cal Baptist, which SCC had defeated by 18 points in its season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were out of shape," Cooper said. "We just stunk up the place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care how good your assistants are. When the head coach is not there 
the team will generally sputter." 
</P>
<P>
 After returning from Fresno, the Vanguards had two weeks to prepare for their 
next game, a span that might have helped Cooper as much as the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helped me get my mind off it," Cooper said. "We really got a lot done and 
I think we came together as a team in those last weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 SCC lost to Cal State Dominguez Hills, 68-62, but Cooper was pleased with the 
Vanguards' progress. SCC led by six with two minutes left before fading. 
Dominguez Hills has beaten Concordia by 40 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "During those two weeks we ran them really hard," Cooper said. "I thought they 
were in really good shape for the Dominguez Hills game and then we're off for 
another 10 days and now we're probably back to (ground) zero. They promised me 
that they would run over the vacation, but they never do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A big part of SCC's problem is that the Vanguards have lost three post 
players. Cooper expected Sanja Simidzija to average about 25 points and 10 
rebounds, but the 6-foot-2 forward from Serbia decided to quit the team because 
of an offer to train for an international banking job. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Whittemore, a 6-foot freshman who led her high school team to an Oregon 
state championship last year, and Sarah Eberhardt, a 5-10 freshman from 
Beaumont High, each suffered injured knees and probably will miss the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrie Elsaesser, a 6-3 senior who played at Los Amigos High and Orange Coast, 
has stepped in and is averaging eight points and seven rebounds. Cooper hopes 
Heather Woodruff, a 6-2 freshman from Springfield, Ore., will be able to adjust 
to college play. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Vanguards aren't deep, Heather Brannan, a 5-10 senior wing player 
from La Quinta High and OCC, has played more at forward than usual. Brannan 
leads the team in scoring with a 16-point average and is second in rebounding 
average (six). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards (2-5) play three consecutive home games starting with tonight's 
7:30 game against Bethel (Kan.). They play host to Concordia (Wis.) at 7:30 
p.m. Friday and Concordia (Neb.) at 3:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friday and Saturday games are part of doubleheaders with the men's team. 
The Vanguard men's team will play Concordia (Ore.) at 5 p.m. Friday and 
Concordia (Minn.) at 6 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Concordia Irvine men's team plays host to Concordia (Minn.) at 7:30 p.m. 
Friday and Concordia (Ore.) at 5 p.m. Saturday. The Eagle women's team plays at 
Cal State Los Angeles Friday. . . . The Chapman men's team, which plays 
Lewis-Clark State (Idaho) tonight at the Utah State tournament, plays host to 
Claremont-Mudd at 6 p.m. Saturday. The Chapman women's team is playing in the 
UC San Diego tournament, which finishes Friday.

KEEPING TRACK / JASON REID: POMONA'S ROSS ALMOST ALL THE WAY BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The late-night phone calls home to mom and the tears of nervous frustration 
are admittedly a long way from ending, but Michaela Ross' comeback is 
considerably ahead of schedule -- even her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, a freshman swing player for perennial Division II power Cal Poly Pomona, 
is back on the basketball court after suffering numerous injuries in an 
automobile accident about 15 months ago. And although Ross hasn't yet regained 
the form that made her one of Orange County's best while at Newport Harbor 
High, she believes she is making strides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really recover fast from injuries," Ross said. "After I got over the 
initial depression about the accident, I kind of took the same mentality I did 
with my previous injuries and said, 'Well, all I can do is work on getting 
better.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I also didn't let myself admit how bad it was." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 11, 1993, Ross and three Pomona teammates were in an accident that 
left Ross, a passenger, with the most serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, knocked unconscious when her head smashed through the windshield, 
suffered a partially collapsed lung, fractured pelvis, fractured lower 
vertebrae, broken right wrist and right thumb, dislocated and broken right 
ankle, dislocated and broken toes on her right foot, and cuts around her right 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ross, who was granted a medical redshirt year by the NCAA, was back 
in the gym shooting and dribbling by last January. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos' coaching staff is working Ross into the lineup slowly. She plays 
about 15 minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all my years of practice, I've never seen someone come back to this level 
of competition from injuries this severe," said Dr. Steven Gausewitz, one of 
Ross' physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, things aren't easy for Ross. And they might never be again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physically, I'm about 90% back," said Ross, 19. "But mentally, I still have a 
ways to go. I need to build a lot more confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 The injuries to Ross' feet and ankles prevented her from keeping her 
basketball skills sharp during the recuperation process. She could dribble and 
shoot, but there is a lot more to the game than that. 
</P>

 "Because my ankle was crushed, I couldn't jump, stop or pivot," she said. 
"When I started to really practice, I was a little bit afraid because everyone 
around me was just as good as I used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross compounded her worry with lofty goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have very high expectations of myself," she said. "I love basketball so 
much, I had so much fun in high school, I just want to do what I know I can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her previous injuries, Ross suffered a dislocated left shoulder 
and left foot during practice this season. It was more than she could handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just broke down and cried because my body wasn't working the way I wanted 
it to," she said. "But then I got control of my emotions and said, 'I just have 
to go on.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her injuries have inspired her to major in sports medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just figured I've gotten so much physical therapy," Ross said, "I might as 
well go into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Valarie Ross sees improvement in her daughter's outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every game I see her play, she gets a little more confident and a little less 
tentative," Valarie Ross said. "Slowly, I see a smile on her face."

INSIDE OUT / FASHION: THINK PIECES ABOUT FASHION? WE THINK NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know the intellectual community has too much time on its hands when both 
Harper's and the New Republic publish lengthy think pieces on fashion in the 
same month. 
</P>
<P>
 May we make a suggestion? Shuddup already! 
</P>
<P>
 The only things most people want to know is which of the gazillion hair 
products on the market really work, where to buy Armani discount and what the 
super-models think about dieting, exercise, makeup and men. So skip the 
Heidegger. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we can't blame the high-brow mags for wanting to cash in on the 
glamour pie. Except for the occasional critical piece in Allure, Vibe and 
Britain's i-D, mainstream fashion magazines are embarrassingly aligned with 
favorite designers and cosmetics manufacturers. Case in point: The January 
issue of Vogue asks on its cover, "Is Fashion Out of Touch?" And the editors 
put this very good question to "9 Top Designers," who naturally aren't having 
any such heresy. Surprise! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Light Reading: The guy who brought you "30 Years of Fashion Fiascos," Mr. 
Blackwell, has just sold his memoirs to Santa Monica-based General Publishing 
Group. Due out in April, "Rags to Bitches" promises to reveal "the shocking 
unknown side of Blackwell you never knew!" Can we wait? . . . Then in May comes 
"Absolutely Fabulous" -- the book, containing scripts from six episodes of the 
satirical British comedy series, plus photos of Patsy and Edina up to their 
ears in Lacroix and high jinks! 
</P>

 The Diva Who Was DV: Some would undoubtedly describe the late Diana Vreeland 
as a real character. Now she's one for real in "Full Gallop," a play in 
rehearsals for its West Coast premiere in January at the Cassius Carter Centre 
Stage in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman with the scarlet fingernails and lacquered jet flip will be veteran 
Broadway actress Mary Louise Wilson, who along with performer and playwright 
Mark Hampton (not the decorator) wrote the two-act portrayal of the legendary 
Vogue editor and costume curator. "Gallop" draws on material in Vreeland's 
autobiography, "DV," on anecdotes from her associates, and from audiotapes of 
Vreeland speaking to "DV" Editor George Plimpton. 
</P>
<P>
 What inspired Wilson to take on one of fashion's greatest proponents of 
self-invention? "I'm old enough," Wilson says. "I felt her power." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Wilson's sister-in-law was the late Phyllis Starr Wilson, founding 
editor of Self, a former Vreeland employee with many "hilarious" stories about 
the boss, the actress said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vreeland "was so capable of expressing her imagination, and she made other 
people believe in it, and she would never settle for rules," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She kept breaking through. I think the best thing she did was really live 
well. She never had a dime. She was the proof of her own success -- and to die 
world-famous. What could be better?" 
</P>

 Headbanders' Ball: It's baaaaack. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton attended 
church Christmas morning wearing a black velvet headband. She took lots of heat 
from supposed style mavens for the look during her husband's presidential 
campaign. And like any red-blooded American woman, she caved in to Those Who 
Know Better About Such Things -- a.k.a. headband haters.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, we like the look, and are not above slipping on a headband every now and 
then ourselves. Let cynics think that Administration setbacks have sent Hillary 
kicking and screaming back to her security band. Sometimes a headband is only a 
headband. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Totally Martha: Can we ever get enough? Not when she scatters those personal 
tidbits throughout every issue of her magazine. We hunt them down with the sick 
anticipation of an adolescent boy searching for the bunny on the cover of 
Playboy. In the January issue of Martha Stewart Living, devoted entirely to 
weddings, Stewart drops this little bombshell: "After reminiscing wonderfully 
with the other family brides, we questioned our mother about her wedding, and 
learned something none of us had ever suspected. Hers was a 'shotgun' wedding." 
Outed by your own daughter! Ouch!  
</P>
<P>
 Reminiscing about her own wedding, though, Stewart rhapsodizes over her 
then-19-inch waist, an amazing pipe organ, the simple but elegant luncheon at 
the Berkshire Hotel . . . but says nothing about the marriage being kaput. 
Cynics might say she's hiding something. But we're sure she's saving that 
particular story for a special edition on tasteful divorces.

CITY HALL NEWS: PASADENA; SUSPENDED FIRE CHIEF IS REINSTATED, BUT HE WON'T DROP 
CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN UHRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena Fire Chief Kaya Pekerol, who was suspended last month for unspecified 
reasons related to his job performance, was reinstated and is scheduled to 
return to work Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pekerol has said he will not withdraw a claim filed Dec. 7 alleging that 
City Manager Phil Hawkey and other top city officials conspired against him and 
violated his civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I maintain I have done nothing wrong," Pekerol said. "I have never been 
disciplined a day in my life for anything. This has been an emotional 
roller-coaster ride for me and my family." A claim against a government entity 
is usually the first step in the filing of a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey, Pekerol and Pekerol's attorneys have refused to disclose the exact 
reasons for the chief's suspension with pay on Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 After the October, 1993, Altadena fires, Pekerol was the target of a 
no-confidence vote taken among Pasadena firefighters. The Fire Department was 
later cited by the state Occupational Safety and Health Administration for 
several violations, many of them related to faulty equipment that was issued to 
firefighters during the Altadena disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before his suspension, Pekerol said, he was denied a scheduled raise. 
After Pekerol bypassed Hawkey and appealed directly to Mayor Katie Nack for 
more money, Hawkey indefinitely suspended Pekerol. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials would not reveal Pekerol's exact salary. The top annual salary 
the fire chief in Pasadena can earn is $106,584. Pekerol has been with the 
Pasadena Fire Department for 26 years and chief for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 10-minute meeting with Hawkey on Dec. 21, Pekerol was reinstated and 
ordered back to work on Jan. 9. Hawkey declined to talk about the suspension 
and the reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Black Professional Firefighters Assn. came to Pekerol's defense 
at the Dec. 19 City Council meeting, saying Pekerol, who is white, is a leader 
in the Southern California region for fulfilling affirmative action hiring 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey lauded Pekerol for his department's minority hiring achievements, but 
maintained they had no bearing on the decision to suspend the chief.

 ALTADENA: Builders of the La Vina housing development in the foothills 
bordering Angeles National Forest have begun clearing the old sanatorium site 
to make way for 272 houses, the project manager said. A judge approved the 
plans Dec. 9, ruling that the project's environmental impact report is 
sufficient and that it complies with the county's general plan.The Friends of 
La Vina, an Altadena environmental group, had fought the project in the courts 
for more than five years. The developer, Cantwell Anderson and Southwest 
Diversified, expects to begin construction in March, and the first houses 
should be ready for sale in September. 
</P>
<P>
 ARCADIA: The City Council has voted to require businesses with four or more 
arcade game machines to get a conditional use permit from the city. In 
addition, council members gave final approval to a change in city law to allow 
restaurants to have sidewalk dining and approved the purchase of a $468,000 
aerial ladder truck for the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager William R. Kelly also announced the appointment of Rick Gomez as 
deputy city manager and development services director. Gomez is a former 
redevelopment director for Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
 DUARTE: Councilman James D. Kirchner has moved into the mayor's seat and 
Councilman Phillip R. Reyes has become mayor pro tem. The mayor is appointed by 
the council annually. 
</P>
<P>
 IRWINDALE: The council certified a final environmental impact report for the 
Nu-Way Live Oak Landfill on Live Oak Avenue, and approved a conditional use 
permit for the 75-acre site. The landfill has been operating on an interim 
basis for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH PASADENA: The City Council unanimously approved new design guidelines 
for the city's residential and commercial buildings. The council is especially 
concerned about the growing number of fast-food businesses.

ELECTIONS; CANDIDATES ALREADY JOSTLING FOR SPOTS IN 1996 RACES; AN EARLIER 
PRIMARY AND THE OPENING UP OF OFFICES BY TERM LIMITS ARE AMONG REASONS FOR THE 
EARLY INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few candidates haven't even closed up their 1994 headquarters, but the 1996 
political campaigns already have started in the South Bay, fueled in part by an 
early primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Some candidates already have declared their candidacies, given speeches, even 
sought endorsements from political leaders, all in anticipation of a crowded 
slate of contenders in several South Bay races. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington "haven't even had time for the dust to 
settle," said Tom Martin, an aide to state Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Long 
Beach), who will not be able to run again because of term limits. "But it's 
never too early."  
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the early jockeying is the decision by state lawmakers' to move 
the primary forward from June to March, 1996, a step designed to give 
California more influence in the selection of the Democratic and Republican 
presidential nominees. State and local candidates must compete with White House 
contenders for a limited pool of campaign dollars, so analysts say they have to 
start soliciting donations early. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who is a serious contender has to be out raising money by March," 
said Republican consultant Tom Shortridge of Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks -- who has not yet conceded the 
race she ran this year against Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) -- -- already 
says she plans to run again for the congressional seat in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks could have a few challengers for the Republican nomination. Rancho 
Palos Verdes psychiatrist Irwin Savodnik said that he will decide within a 
month whether he will run. Savodnik spent more than $50,000 of his own money in 
this year's Republican primary but was forced to drop out because he had 
switched his party affiliation too late to qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a very serious race next time," Savodnik said. "We're going 
to put a lot of money in the campaign and we're going to raise a lot of money." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential contender for the seat is Los Angeles developer John Morris, 
who made an unsuccessful bid for state controller this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people thought Jane Harman was invincible," said Morris, one of the 
founders of Ross stores. "They saw how well Susan did and said 'Gee, (Harman) 
can be knocked off.' It should have been a Republican seat, and with a good 
candidate, it will be a Republican seat." 
</P>
<P>
 While Brooks may have an easier time raising money because of her showing in 
November, Savodnik and Morris have greater personal wealth to help them in the 
race. Potential candidates say the bulk of the fund raising will have to be 
done in 1995, although it won't be easy in an off-year, when potential donors 
aren't focused on elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting from scratch will be tough," said John Perkins, who was Brooks' 
campaign manager this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Another congressional incumbent, Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton), also 
is considered vulnerable. The former minister faces charges that he accepted 
bribes while mayor of Compton. A guilty verdict could force a special election, 
even earlier than the March, 1996, primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for the seat being vacated by Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane 
Dana, who is retiring, financing may be the key. According to political 
analysts, a candidate might have to start with a minimum of $250,000. One 
reason is the size of the district, which sprawls from Venice to Long Beach and 
extends inland to Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's twice the size of a state Senate seat," said Torrance Councilman George 
Nakano, who is considering running for the post. He ran unsuccessfully this 
year against incumbent Ralph C. Dills in the Democratic primary in the 28th 
state Senate District. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at the size of the district, and what it would take to be 
successful," Nakano said. "I'm looking at all sorts of things. I haven't given 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Dana is backing his chief deputy, Don Knabe, as his successor, which could 
give Knabe an early edge in fund raising, political consultants say. Long Beach 
Councilman Doug Drummond also has declared, and former Rolling Hills 
Councilwoman Gordana Swanson said she is considering a bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Another large field is expected for Beverly's state Senate seat, which will be 
open because of term limits. Brian Finander, a Democrat who nearly beat Beverly 
in 1992, has announced plans to run. Political observers also mention former 
Assemblywoman Betty Karnette and former Assemblyman Bob Epple, two Democrats 
who lost their races this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republicans who beat them, Steven T. Kuykendall and Phil Hawkins, also 
have been mentioned as possible candidates for the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who better to fight for that seat than an incumbent who already has a 
fund-raising ability?" said Republican consultant Shortridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican prospects also mentioned by political observers include former Long 
Beach Councilman Ray Grabinski, Long Beach businessman Frank Colonna, former 
Long Beach Councilwoman Jan C. Hall and former Bellflower Councilman Bob Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will probably be at least a dozen candidates for this seat," Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is term limits, which, in addition to Beverly's seat, have opened 
up two other South Bay posts. Neither Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. in the 
52nd District, which covers parts of Gardena, nor Assemblyman Curtis R. Tucker 
Jr., whose 51st District includes Inglewood, can run again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous opportunity, particularly for those in local politics," 
said Inglewood Councilman Garland Hardeman, who is interested in running for 
the 51st Assembly District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardeman, however, said he has his immediate sights set on reelection to the 
council in April. If he then chooses to seek higher office, he could have 
familiar competition: Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent also is interested in the 
Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
 According to political consultants, a possible candidate for Murray's seat is 
his daughter, Melinda, a deputy district attorney in Torrance. Murray's son 
Kevin was elected to a Culver City-area Assembly seat this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And while term limits create new opportunities, they could send outgoing 
officeholders looking for new jobs. Murray and Curtis Tucker are mentioned as 
possible candidates for Walter Tucker's congressional seat, depending on the 
outcome of his trial. And even state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) and 
Assemblywoman Juanita M. McDonald (D-Carson), whose terms don't expire until 
1998, could run for the seat, according to political observers. 
</P>
<P>
 With term limits, "As soon as you are elected to office, you have to stop and 
say, 'What do I do next?' " said Democratic political consultant Joe Cerrell. 
". . . What you have is musical chairs at its worst." 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents who could face spirited challenges include Assemblywoman Debra 
Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), who represents a district in which voter registration 
is split almost evenly between both parties. Insurance claims adjuster Julian 
Sirull, Redondo Beach Mayor Brad Parton and Torrance Councilman Dan Walker are 
among the possible contenders, according to political analysts. All have run 
for the seat before. Their hopes were raised because Sirull, despite having 
little money, came within eight percentage points of Bowen this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are a caliber of candidates who before were hesitant to run," said 
Shortridge, who worked for Sirull this year. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the talk in political circles, however, don't expect candidates to 
start knocking on doors at the start of 1995. They'll be working behind the 
scenes, looking for big donors and setting up staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real serious candidates are looking at the races now," said Martin of 
Beverly's office. "But (voters) aren't even focused on 1996. That makes it hard 
to gain support."

TRACK OWNERS BET ON SUCCESS OF THEATER COMPLEX; SANTA ANITA: DWINDLING RACE 
CROWDS PROMPT PLANS TO BUILD A FAMILY-STYLE ENTERTAINMENT-RETAIL CENTER IN THE 
HUGE PARKING LOT. SOME NEIGHBORS, HOWEVER, EXPRESS CONCERN OVER THE PROPOSED 
$100-MILLION DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For six decades, the crowds have come to Santa Anita Park in Arcadia to watch 
magnificent horses at full gallop beneath the midday sun. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the stands no longer as full as before, executives at this Southland 
landmark are proposing a $100-million entertainment complex in the track's huge 
parking lot to lure a new type of customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita's owners, The Santa Anita Companies, envision a village about the 
size of Disneyland's Main Street featuring the nation's biggest movie theater 
(25 screens), restaurants, a 5,000-seat auditorium/theater, food outlets, 
bookstores, a virtual reality gaming center and possibly an ice rink. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex would be situated southeast of the track's main grandstand, not 
far from Santa Anita Fashion Park, and take up about a tenth of the 320-acre 
property, Santa Anita officials said. The company owns 50% of the fashion park 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process of developing plans for an entertainment-retail complex 
almost contiguous to the racetrack," said Christopher T. Stirling, president of 
Santa Anita Realty Enterprises Inc. "It will have a village feel to it and 
provide family entertainment throughout the day." 
</P>
<P>
 The company has been looking for ways to boost revenue and utilize its largely 
unused 145-acre parking lot since racetrack attendance began declining seven 
years ago. The decline has been attributed in part to competition from the 
state lottery and satellite off-track wagering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to look at what else we can do with this property," said Clifford 
C. Goodrich, Santa Anita's vice president. "A family-oriented entertainment 
complex will bring people here and make money for our shareholders and Arcadia 
taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the publicly traded Santa Anita Companies is worth more than $300 
million, its returns to investors have dipped in recent years. The firm 
consists of Santa Anita Operating Co. and Santa Anita Realty Enterprises, one 
of the nation's largest real estate investment trusts. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita officials are betting on their new venture to turn their finances 
around and hope to finalize contracts with tenants in the next two months. They 
expect to submit plans for the project, which would be built in phases, to the 
city in the first quarter of 1995. Construction could begin in 1996 and the 
first phase would then open the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The village, designed to attract a younger, more family-oriented crowd than 
the racetrack, would be separate from the horse-racing operation and cater to 
the region's residents rather than tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for more repeat business, not a CityWalk," said Sherwood C. 
Chillingworth, Santa Anita's vice chairman, referring to the Universal Studios 
development. Chillingworth, himself a horse owner, said he hopes to have the 
new venture's sports bar over the track's saddling paddock so a new generation 
of race-goers will be generated.  
</P>
<P>
 Chillingworth said the new venture will be a bonus for Arcadia by generating 
new taxes, and that the auditorium will provide a cultural center for public 
meetings and Broadway shows. "Arcadia is our partner," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members welcomed the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's exciting to see (that) Santa Anita, which is the largest 
supporter and employer in this city, has a future, " said Councilman Dennis A. 
Lojeski. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project, like any other, will have to go through the proper zoning 
changes . . . but the bottom line is this track paid for our City Hall, police 
station, high school and our hospital," he said, referring to the tax income 
Santa Anita generates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Anita's neighbors, who previously fought plans for a concert hall 
and expressed concerns about the city allowing outdoor concerts, are not 
greeting the project with open arms. And they fear the city will be won over by 
the project because Santa Anita's companies provide a big chunk of Arcadia's 
municipal revenue. Last year alone, the track, the mall and Santa Anita's 
medical building generated $3.4 million in taxes for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked. No one has ever given any indications they were thinking of 
something like this," said Lee Merritt, who lives near the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita's Goodrich dismisses such opposition. "There will always be a 
no-growth group. Some people will oppose whatever we do," Goodrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 But company officials are aware the tide could turn against their project if 
opponents grow in number. In 1975, the shopping mall barely gained approval 
after 17 hearings and a ballot vote by Arcadia residents.  
</P>
<P>
 To avoid a similar backlash, Santa Anita officials have formed a committee of 
17 community leaders. Many of the track's neighbors say the committee is 
weighted in favor of the project's proponents, and that those prominent in 
debates over the facility in the past have been left out.

A REAL SPIN DOCTOR; ENTREPRENEUR: TURNTABLE RETAILER IN MONROVIA BUCKS CD 
TREND. HE CATERS TO AUDIOPHILES WHO PREFER VINYL RECORDS TO DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an era when most music is memorialized on CD and laser disc, Brooks Berdan 
is keeping the record player alive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His retail store, located in a nondescript industrial park in downtown 
Monrovia, is unknown to many of his neighbors. Yet it draws audiophiles from as 
far away as Turkey and Hong Kong who are willing to pay up to $15,000 for a 
turntable. 
</P>
<P>
 Berdan also consults with movie designers who want to capture the vintage 
vinyl look in their films and finds himself presiding over a mini-vinyl 
revival. Even though many Americans own those little silver discs, the LP 
market has stubbornly refused to die, and so have turntables. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of steep decline, audio experts say the market has bottomed out, 
leaving small niches where entrepreneurs like Berdan can flourish. His 
eponymous store, Brooks Berdan Ltd., stocks dozens of high-end new and used 
turntables that start at $500 and go up to $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Berdan, who caters mainly to the audiophile crowd, not the Circuit City 
shopper, keeps a low profile and gets business mainly by word of mouth or the 
small ads he places in specialty audio magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't need a clown standing on the corner with balloons waving people in. I 
really don't want walk-in traffic," maintains 38-year-old Berdan, who said he 
has been fascinated by sound since he got his first stereo at age 7. 
</P>
<P>
 A tinkerer who has turned a hobby into a livelihood, Berdan lives in La Verne 
and commutes daily to Monrovia. Some of his customers come looking for new 
turntables. Others arrive lugging their old equipment, which they ask Berdan to 
calibrate or repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Berdan will even build new parts for old turntables whose manufacturers have 
gone out of business and left owners with equipment whose components cannot be 
replaced commercially when they break down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of anyone else doing what he's doing," said Ivan Berger, 
technical editor for Audio Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1994, Stereophile magazine christened Berdan "Mr. Analog." In analog 
technology, the electronic signal responds to physical changes such as a groove 
in a record; in digital technology, sounds or images are converted into groups 
of electronic bits and stored on a magnetic medium like a CD. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brooks is one of the true believers in analog. He's a keeper of the flame," 
said Michael Fremer, senior music editor of the audiophile magazine The 
Absolute Sound and editor of The Tracking Angle, a music newsletter for 
audiophiles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "He supported analog during the darkest days when CDs seemed to be taking over 
and other dealers were getting out of it as quickly as they could because they 
saw the digital handwriting on the wall. He became a catch basket for all that 
analog, and now that records are making a comeback he's come up smelling like a 
rose." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a purchase is made, Berdan helps set up stereo systems in customers' 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Placing speakers correctly is really important," Berdan said. "A quarter-inch 
one way or another makes a lot of difference in the sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Berdan is also called in to consult on movie projects requiring that pre-CD 
look. His most recent job was for the Robert Redford-Demi Moore movie "Indecent 
Proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 The turntable maven loaned one of his more expensive models for use as a prop 
in the pivotal scene right before Redford and Moore dance off to bed. Berdan 
also coached Redford on how to cue up records on the turntable, whose complex, 
high-tech workings are light years away from the battered stereos that once 
adorned most college dorms. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, CD players claim the bulk of the market -- 4 million CD players sold 
last year vs. 500,000 turntables, according to industry statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 But today's customer can choose from among more than 100 turntable models made 
by 34 different manufacturers, which is up about 6% from what was available 
last year, according to Audio magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Before opening his own store in 1987, Berdan spent years working at various 
stereo retail stores, honing his knowledge of both mass-market equipment and 
high-end models. In audiophile parlance, that means systems that start at about 
$2,000 and focus on the purest listening experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea for high-end listeners is not to listen to your stereo, but to 
recreate the original musical event, to make you think you are sitting in that 
symphony hall," Berdan said. 
</P>
<P>
 To woo potential buyers as well as conduct his own research, Berdan has 
constructed a $25,000 listening room inside his retail store. Wooden 
"diffusers" line many of the walls to bounce back the sound. On another wall 
hangs a Persian carpet, which also helps the acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the plants arrayed throughout the room serve a function: Berdan says 
sound travels through the air best in a room that is maintained at 40% 
humidity, which is enhanced by green, well-watered plants. 
</P>
<P>
 He seats listeners in the middle of a strategically placed sofa to hear his 
analog sound system, so sophisticated that each musical instrument and 
percussive clap can be heard individually, like a crystal-clear bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they sit down in that room, I don't have to do much selling," Berdan 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 For those for whom analog is but a dim memory, today's turntables range from 
$100 for a bottom-of-the-line Pioneer PL-203AZ to $30,000 for a Rockport 
Technologies Sirius Limited Edition model. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the market for turntables is populated mainly by DJs, audiophiles, 
record collectors and young grunge-rock fans, who favor those anachronistic 
LPs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sub Pop Records in Seattle issues everything on vinyl. The group Pearl Jam 
sold 50,000 copies of its latest album on vinyl. Other bands now press a 
limited vinyl edition with their latest CD and many mom-and-pop labels never 
stopped putting out dance, rap and alternative rock on LP formats. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz buffs are another market. Blue Note Records, which stopped releasing LPs 
in 1990, did an about-face in 1994 and reissued some of its classic jazz 
recordings, such as Ornette Coleman, Wayne Shorter and Bobby Hutchington on 
vinyl as well as CD to attract DJs, audiophiles and collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many audiophiles, including Berdan, claim records have a warmer sound, 
although CD buffs dispute that. But analog fans also talk wistfully of the 
rituals that accompany vinyl, including the pleasures of handling the thin 
platter, reading the liner notes and scrutinizing the cover art.  
</P>
<P>
 And they speak of the need to set up and calibrate analog equipment properly, 
install cartridges and clean records. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, kids getting into (vinyl) have no idea where to turn. They go 
to Radio Shack, and the kid working at Radio Shack has no idea where to turn," 
Fremer said. "Now's the time to show kids how to do it right because the 
knowledge is being lost." 
</P>
<P>
 That may also be true for more sophisticated music lovers with disposable 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's where Berdan comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are willing to spend $50,000 on a Persian rug, yet you walk into their 
house and they're listening to music on a tinny $500 stereo," Berdan mused. 
"They just don't know the quality that exists out there."

COURT LIFTS 'CLOUD' OVER GABRIELINO HIGH SCHOOL; LAW: NEW SCHOOL WILL REMAIN 
OPEN. DISPUTE CENTERED ON VOTE IN SAN GABRIEL FOR NEW DISTRICT. ALHAMBRA SOUGHT 
RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Officials of two local school districts reacted with either relief or 
disappointment this week in the wake of an appeals court ruling that allows 
Gabrielino High School in San Gabriel to remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has been living in a state of ambiguity," said Gary Goodson, San 
Gabriel school district superintendent. "It's like a dark cloud has been lifted 
from over us." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Alhambra, school officials had a sharply different view. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very disappointing," said Dora Padilla, member of the Alhambra school 
board, which earlier this year won a court ruling to block the school's 
opening. "It's surprising to win one case and then lose another because two 
judges see it differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabrielino High School has been at the center of a disagreement between the 
San Gabriel and the Alhambra City and High School districts since a 1992 
election created a new district and paved the way for the school's opening. The 
dispute centered on the fact that only voters in San Gabriel were allowed to 
cast ballots in that election even though it also affected Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Gabrielino High opened this fall, students who lived in San Gabriel 
attended high school in the Alhambra district. Alhambra administrators opposed 
the unification, because they stood to lose about 1,200 students over the next 
four years and as much as $1 million a year in state funding. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled in favor of Alhambra, 
declaring the 1992 election unconstitutional because not everyone affected by 
the measure was allowed to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 22, however, the 2nd District Court of Appeals, in overturning the 
June ruling, said the people in the San Gabriel district had a right to make 
their own determination on unification and that the election boundaries 
selected by the state Board of Education were appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alhambra school board plans to meet in January to discuss whether to 
appeal the case.

A TRUE HAVEN FOR BABIES IS ON ITS WAY; CHILD CARE: THREE WOMEN ARE WORKING TO 
DEVELOP A LOCAL FACILITY THAT WILL PROVIDE A HOMELIKE SETTING AND LEGAL HELP 
FOR INFANTS FROM TROUBLED FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 While caring for a foster baby named Ernie one night, Connie Maloney heard a 
knock on the door of her Manhattan Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Ernie's mother. That day, she had left her temporary residence -- a 
battered women's shelter -- and headed to court. No one was there to represent 
Ernie, so his mother, who was going through a drug rehabilitation program, was 
able to persuade a judge to let her take care of the child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to give the baby back that moment," recalled Maloney, 46. "And there 
was no way she was ready to take that baby back." 
</P>
<P>
 Prodded by the incident with Ernie, Maloney is working to develop a facility 
in the South Bay that will care for babies from troubled families by providing 
them a homelike setting as well as an ally in court.  
</P>
<P>
 With the aid of Becky Grossman, who has helped teach at a co-op preschool 
program, and Julie Jacks, who helped begin a day-care program at a Xerox 
facility, Maloney is trying set up a program modeled after "The Little Blue 
House" in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1991, the Blue House cares for up to six babies at a time. 
Child-care workers are on the premises 24 hours a day, and a social worker 
deals with the government to try to ensure permanent placement of the babies. 
The organization's goal is to have the babies adopted by the time they reach 
their first birthday.  
</P>
<P>
 A staff social worker and pro bono legal help represent the babies.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the thousands of babies in the foster care system, nearly 1,000 of them 
each year are abandoned by their mothers in the Los Angeles hospitals where 
they are born, according to a 1992 survey by the Child Welfare League of 
America. The South Bay Blue House would target some of those infants. But 
creating a group home to help them is not simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Maloney estimates she would need $250,000 a year for salaries, supplies and 
insurance. The three women have raised about $1,000. They also need to get 
licensed, hire workers and, most importantly, obtain a house. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a daunting task, but Maloney, who holds a master's degree in child 
development from Loma Linda University, and her colleagues have recruited about 
80 volunteers during bimonthly meetings in the area. She plans to apply for 
funds from the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services 
for expenses related to the children, and hopes to raise the rest from private 
donations and fund-raisers.  
</P>
<P>
 Martha Lopez, deputy director for the California Department of Social Services 
Community Care Licensing Division, isn't optimistic about approving the type of 
project the women propose. "If (children) are below the age of 6, we don't want 
them in a group home," said Lopez, whose agency approves the opening of all 
such homes that provide 24-hour non-medical care and supervision to children. 
"An infant needs to be put in a family setting." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jacquie Dolan, chairman of the board of Friends of Child Advocates and 
member of the California Children's Lobby, says the Little Blue House is 
needed.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Little Blue House in Washington also ran into hurdles. Guidelines for 
establishing such a place didn't exist, and zoning laws didn't cover their type 
of facility. Still, co-founders Patty and Lynne Gartenhaus managed to get the 
facility set up and have placed 40 babies in three years, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 If it opens as planned in 1995, the local Little Blue House would be the first 
group home serving six or fewer babies up to 2 years old in the South Bay, 
according to records at Community Care Licensing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The house would aid babies during the critical months of their development, 
said Mary Emmons, executive director of Children's Institute International, a 
South Bay emergency shelter for babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're gaining language, a sense of who they are, a sense of trust in the 
world," Emmons said.  
</P>
<P>
 There seem to be benefits for taxpayers. The Little Blue House in Washington 
says it spent $99 per day on the children in 1992. According to the Child 
Welfare League survey, the daily boarding cost for abandoned babies in Los 
Angeles hospitals is $1,165. And if welfare benefits are cut, as suggested by 
incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the need for low-cost group homes becomes 
even stronger.  
</P>
<P>
 Grossman and Jacks, who each have two children of their own, and Maloney 
continue to try to drum up support for their idea. Recently the threesome went 
to Adams Middle School in Redondo Beach to receive a quilt schoolchildren had 
created for the babies. "My kids already (say): 'This (quilt) is for the 
babies,' " said Grossman, who is expecting a third child in January. "They love 
the thought of the babies."

TERM LIMIT ISSUE FAILS TO MAKE PASADENA BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A petition seeking to limit the number of terms Pasadena City Council members 
may serve has fallen short of the number of signatures required to qualify for 
the special April election. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Maria Stewart said Wednesday that a random sampling of the 
petitions turned in last month showed that too few of the 14,355 signatures 
were valid for a complete count under state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder checked 500 signatures against the 
office's computerized list of registered Pasadena voters and found 343 -- or 
about 69% -- to be valid, Stewart said. The California secretary of state's 
office requires 95% of the sample to be valid to proceed to an individual 
count, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition, circulated by onetime council candidate Nicholas Conway, sought 
to limit council members to two four-year terms and would have been 
retroactive. Conway's only means of appealing the count is to go to court, 
Stewart said. Conway was unavailable for comment Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed to discover (an inadequate percentage) of the sample were 
registered voters," said Councilman Bill Crowfoot, a supporter of a term-limits 
ballot measure. "I think it reflects on the people collecting the signatures 
and shows a lot of people out there who are for term limits don't bother to 
register to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the City Council declined to put a term-limit measure on the 
March municipal ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition required 15% of registered Pasadena voters' signatures -- 9,861 
-- to qualify for the ballot. Based on the 343 valid signatures, it was 
projected that 9,051 signatures were valid, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said most of signatures were declared invalid because the names did 
not belong to registered voters or residents of Pasadena. One of the 500 
signatures was a duplicate, she said.

POMONA CARD CLUB TALKS PUT ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Pomona has been temporarily barred from entering into agreements 
with card club developers while Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne 
decides whether to make her ruling permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 12, Wayne issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the city 
from signing card club licenses.Six days later, the council approved a license 
agreement with Champs, one of the casino developers, but was unable to finalize 
the agreement because of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Wayne issued an injunction that appears to block the city from 
taking any further action on the card clubs, said Pomona City Atty. Arnold M. 
Alvarez-Glasman. As a result, the agreement with Champs, as well as a council 
decision on the proposed Tradewinds casino, are on hold until Jan. 20, when 
Wayne is scheduled to make a final decision.

STATE BOARD CHARGES FUNERAL HOMES WITH VIOLATIONS; PROBE: NEPTUNE SOCIETY 
ALLEGEDLY MISHANDLED REMAINS AND FAILED TO PUT CONSUMERS' MONEY IN TRUST FUND. 
THE ORGANIZATION DENIES ANY WRONGDOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Three Neptune Society funeral homes, including one in San Pedro, mishandled 
the cremations of three men and failed to put more than $12.5 million of 
consumers' money in a trust fund, according to a state agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations were made recently against the Neptune Society of Los Angeles 
in San Pedro and Burbank and the Neptune Society of Santa Barbara after an 
investigation by Richard P. Yanes, executive officer of the state Board of 
Funeral Directors and Embalmers. Yanes filed the accusations with the board, 
which will decide what action to take. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Neptune, a cremation company that picks up bodies, stores them 
and arranges for their disposal, deny the charges. If the charges are proved 
true, the licenses of the funeral homes could be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 Yanes said the remains of Bertram Carter and Dallas Williams of Los Angeles 
and Gary Manoff, whose residence is unknown, were mishandled, and the funeral 
homes engaged in "fraud and misrepresentation."  
</P>
<P>
 The San Pedro funeral home was responsible for all three bodies, Yanes said. 
All three sites are being investigated for mishandling of funds under the 
accusation.  
</P>
<P>
 Yanes says Carter's body was discovered at Neptune's San Pedro facility in 
September after funeral home officials said the ashes had been scattered at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Williams case, the accusation says Neptune delivered cremated remains 
to Williams' wife in June, but his body was discovered in a funeral home 
storage facility in September. Neptune gave false information to the Registrar 
of Vital Statistics to correct Williams' death certificate, Yanes says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Manoff case, Yanes says, Neptune misrepresented itself as having the 
authority to remove Manoff's body from a care facility and cremate it. Neptune 
allegedly told Manoff's brother the ashes would be stored, but then they were 
scattered at sea two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 The society also allegedly furnished false information on the death 
certificate and forged the physician's signature on it, Yanes said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There has been no wrongdoing by the society," a society statement said. "All 
of our customers' funds are fully protected in trust accounts, and there is no 
risk to any of our customers. We have been servicing the needs of our customers 
for over 20 years and take great pride in the sensitivity of our business as 
well as our obligations to our members." 
</P>
<P>
 Burt Pines, a lawyer for the Neptune Society, said he is planning to file a 
formal defense and request a formal hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint also involves money paid by consumers for urns, memorial plaques 
and containers. Yanes said only 9,000 items that customers had paid for were 
available during an inventory in November, although the society said it had 
90,500 items for its customers. The difference in the value of the inventory is 
about $9 million in consumer funds, he said.  
</P>

 Also, the society collected membership registration fees totaling more than 
$3.4 million that should have been placed in a trust fund, Yanes said.

REDONDO TREASURER'S SUIT SAYS OFFICIALS LIBELED HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Redondo Beach Treasurer Alice E. DeLong filed a libel suit against city 
officials who she says have been out to ruin her reputation over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit filed Friday, DeLong says she was defamed by memos circulated in 
City Hall earlier this year that portray her as a drunkard who harasses city 
employees. She asked the court to halt closed-session City Council meetings 
where her office is discussed, and she called for city officials to stop 
harassing her. 
</P>
<P>
 Named in the suit, which also claims civil rights and slander violations, were 
Mayor Brad Parton, the City Council, City Manager William E. Kirchhoff and City 
Atty. Jerry Goddard. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong could not be reached for comment, but her attorney said Tuesday that 
DeLong filed the suit to defend her name and the integrity of the treasurer's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she owes a duty to the citizens of Redondo Beach," attorney David P. 
King said. "She's doing it on behalf of the people of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong, who has served as the city's elected treasurer for 19 years, is 
seeking reelection in the city's March election. She has been under fire for 
about a year, since Kirchhoff told the council he could no longer supervise her 
office because she mistreated employees and failed to properly manage the 
city's $40 million in investments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, DeLong said she has been harassed because she criticized 
Kirchhoff's handling of $6.3 million in redevelopment money, which DeLong 
alleged was transferred illegally to city coffers in 1992. Kirchhoff, who could 
not be reached for comment, has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong said that after she raised the complaint, a memo was circulated that 
falsely accused her of being drunk on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the council has formed a committee to study the city's investments 
and oversee the treasurer's office, and an attorney for a city employees' union 
made public several workers' allegations that DeLong has come to work under the 
influence of alcohol and has intimidated employees. The attorney, Sylvia E. 
Kellison, who was also named in the suit, told the council that a supervisor in 
DeLong's department had sexually harassed three employees. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong has denied being under the influence at work and said she was unaware 
of any harassment in her office.  
</P>
<P>
 DeLong said in the suit that the alleged defamation resulted in her being 
"scorned and abandoned by all her friends, co-workers, neighbors and 
constituents." In addition, she stated she has suffered "humiliation, 
embarrassment, hurt feelings, mental anguish and suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Robert Pinzler said he sympathizes with DeLong. He said he has 
been frustrated by the many memos and reports regarding DeLong that have been 
circulated outside City Hall, and he said he understands why she filed suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure she had a whole lot of choice in the matter," he said. "Here are 
some people she felt were abusing her, and what other choice do you have when 
you feel like you're being defamed?" 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Marilyn White said she was disappointed by the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seem to be getting further and further away from why we're there, which is 
to help the city," she said. "I'm tired of Redondo being the city everyone is 
watching. It's a good city, and I don't like to see things get messed up like 
this."

LAW; POLICE TEACH BARTENDERS TO SPOT, STOP DRUNKS

 The classroom is a Pasadena restaurant or night spot. The students are the 
owners and staff, the teacher a representative of the Pasadena Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, especially timely as New Year's Eve approaches, is to teach the 
people who serve alcohol how to tell if someone is drunk and ways to encourage 
patrons to switch to nonalcoholic drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the police department received a $250,000 grant from the state 
Office of Traffic Safety to increase drunk driving enforcement and to set up a 
preventive alcohol awareness program, which the department calls the 
Responsible Hospitality Community Council.  
</P>
<P>
 Police representative Joone Kim and Sgt. George Wiley have conducted sessions 
at seven bars and nightclubs in Pasadena, including Club Shelter and Q's 
Billiards. 
</P>
<P>
 At Club Shelter, for example, Kim taught manager Steve Waite and his staff how 
to spot fake IDs and the telltale signs of drunkenness. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim provides about three hours of training at each business. So far, she said, 
the response has been positive. "It's nice to have the police department be 
sensitive to their needs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local business managers were approached about participating in the class when 
the police department organized meetings to prepare for the World Cup.  
</P>
<P>
 Club Shelter's Waite said that his staff knew a lot of what Kim was teaching, 
but that the class was helpful.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the most effective part is that they keep awareness fresh in 
everybody's mind," he said.

MEDICINE; HOSPITAL TO SHED SOME BEDS AS IT GROWS; FACILITY WILL DE-EMPHASIZE 
INPATIENT CARE IN FAVOR OF OUTPATIENT SERVICES, WHOSE DEMAND HAS QUADRUPLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Following a trend among hospitals around the region, Methodist Hospital of 
Southern California in Arcadia is planning a $32-million expansion that will 
actually reduce the number of beds by 30% and increase outpatient services 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patient Tower project, which is being financed through a combination of 
hospital reserves, bond sales and donations, will reduce the number of beds 
from 347 to 243, said Greg Bonn, a hospital vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of advances in medical treatment and surgical techniques, the average 
number of days a patient needs to stay in the hospital has fallen dramatically, 
Bonn said, from an average of six days in 1990 to 5.4 days. As a result, many 
hospital beds go unused, costing hospitals the money to maintain them without 
the income from patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 347 beds available at Methodist Hospital, only 190 were in use in 
mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are encountering is a whole new era for hospitals," Bonn said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984 at Southern California hospitals, the average daily bed occupancy rate 
was about 65%, said David Langness, spokesman for the Hospital Council of 
Southern California. By this year, the rate had fallen to 48%. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, demand for outpatient services has increased 400%, Langness 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is happening all over the region," he said. "Southern California is just 
full of these kinds of projects." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, hospital expansion meant more beds. Now, hospitals are working 
on their buildings, but with fewer beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena has a reconstruction plan that calls 
for 146 of the hospital's 604 beds to be eliminated, said Huntington spokesman 
Steve Willis. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Covina, Queen of the Valley Hospital and the Intercommunity Medical 
Center merged in May, giving the combined facility 525 beds. The two hospitals 
use 370 of the beds.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; RAILROADS TO SIGN ALAMEDA CORRIDOR PACT

<P>
 An operating agreement is to be signed today by three railroad companies, 
committing them to using the Alameda Corridor, a 20-mile railway that will be 
built to speed cargo to and from the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from Long Beach, Los Angeles and the Southern Pacific, Union 
Pacific and Santa Fe railroads are scheduled to attend a signing ceremony at 
10:30 a.m. at the Long Beach Container Terminal's dockside rail facility on 
Pier F in the Port of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the railroads will pay $15 for each 20-foot cargo 
container transported along the corridor, plus additional charges for 
non-container traffic. The fees will be used to help pay the revenue bonds 
issued for the $1.8-billion project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had milestones all along the way, but this is kind of the culmination," 
said Barbara Yamamoto, spokeswoman for the Port of Los Angeles. The ports can 
now focus on obtaining funding from the federal government, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Port officials have purchased 26.3 miles of right of way from Southern Pacific 
Railroad, 18.6 miles from Union Pacific Railroad and .7 miles from the 
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. Although the Alameda Corridor will only 
be 20 miles long, the ports had to buy additional railway for alternate routes. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is scheduled to begin in 1995, and the project is scheduled to be 
operating by 2001. MARISA OSORIO COLON

ENVIRONMENT ; VALLEY'S BIRD POPULATION CONTINUES TO DECLINE, AUDUBON'S COUNT 
FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The annual winter bird count has found that the San Gabriel Valley's bird 
population continues to decline. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 17 about 40 Pasadena Audubon Society members, including expert and 
novice bird-watchers, spread out over a 15-mile radius centered in Pasadena and 
spotted 139 species. 
</P>
<P>
 Most observed common species, such as yellow-rumped warblers, scrub jays and 
white-crowned sparrows, said Audubon member Judy Bass.  
</P>
<P>
 "But we also spotted a varied thrush, which is very unusual for these parts," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the counts began almost 100 years ago, there has been a marked decline 
in the San Gabriel Valley bird population, because development has eliminated 
many trees, insects and standing bodies of water, Bass said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be flocks with thousands of birds, and now we're lucky to see a 
hundred. Once there were road runners and cactus wrens in Eaton Canyon, but 
they are long gone," said Bass, who added that the best places to spot unusual 
birds in the region are Mt. Wilson, Huntington Gardens and Rose Hills and 
Mountain View cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual count is an international undertaking, with chapters around the 
world reporting their counts that are tabulated by the Audubon Society to 
determine population trends among bird species worldwide.

BAR NONE AT THIS NEW YEAR'S EVE BASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 New York celebrates New Year's Eve at Times Square, and thousands flood Las 
Vegas streets every Dec. 31 around midnight. Now Hermosa Beach will offer a New 
Year's Eve party of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly six hours, musicians, poets, dancers and actors will perform in 
Hermosa's downtown to ring in the new year. A portion of Pier Avenue will be 
closed to traffic, clowns will roam the streets and adults and children will be 
encouraged to decorate masks and noisemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of the city's first crack at FirstNIGHT, a New Year's Eve 
tradition in 100 cities that emphasizes alcohol-free cultural enrichment. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston's event attracts 1 million party-goers annually, and Fullerton hosts a 
similar festival, but a FirstNIGHT has never been held in Los Angeles County. 
Organizers hope the event will catch on in Hermosa. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances, including interactive theater, jazz bands, poetry and dance, 
will begin at 6:30 p.m. and continue for five hours. Among the performers 
scheduled are flamenco guitarist Philip John Lee, jazz band Le Jazz Hot and 
folk band Zen Gecko. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11:30 p.m., a New Orleans jazz band will blast music onto Pier Avenue, 
where event participants can dance until the countdown to midnight begins. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is being promoted as an alcohol-free way to ring in the New Year. 
While no alcohol will be served at the performance sites, area bars will sell 
liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers expect thousands of area residents to attend. Admission tickets in 
the form of buttons are available in several downtown shops and at the Hermosa 
Beach Chamber of Commerce. The buttons cost $8 in advance and $10 at the event. 
Children under 12 will be admitted free. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen performances are planned. Organizers with the nonprofit Arts 
Hermosa scaled back the event after they collected only about a third of the 
$100,000 they had hoped to raise to pay performers. Fund raising was hampered 
because many are unfamiliar with the concept of FirstNIGHT, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This first year we're selling air," said John Scudder, president of Arts 
Hermosa. "Next year, we'll have photographs of this year's event and fund 
raising will be easier." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope the event will grow into a popular Southland tradition. 
Hermosa resident Dragana Bajalovic, who attended her first FirstNIGHT in Boston 
in 1976 and proposed the idea to city officials, said she hopes the festival 
will foster a greater appreciation of arts in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's tragic the way arts are not valued in this country," said 
Bajalovic, a professional pianist who moved to the United States from 
Yugoslavia 25 years ago. "Arts bring people together."

COMMUNITY NEWS: INGLEWOOD; ANTI-GUNFIRE CAMPAIGN SET FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It takes little knowledge of physics or advanced mathematics to understand the 
dangers of a violent New Year's Eve tradition in Los Angeles: the firing of 
guns into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Diane Robinson of the Inglewood Police Department said simply: "What 
goes up must come down." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to quell the warlike tradition, Inglewood is sponsoring its third 
annual New Year's Eve anti-gunfire campaign, distributing flyers that detail 
the dangers of indiscriminate firing and setting up a phone number residents 
can call if they hear gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who witness someone shooting a gun on New Year's Eve should dial 911, 
Robinson said, but those who only hear gunfire can call (310) 412-8771 to 
report the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one has been reported hit by the lead fallout in Inglewood since a 
police officer was struck in the foot in 1988, shots are fired every year, 
police say, and bullets can fall with such force that they pierce roofs and 
cars. ERIC SLATER

COMMUNITY NEWS: MANHATTAN BEACH; SLAIN OFFICER MOURNED IN CANDLELIGHT VIGIL

<TEXT>
<P>
 A stream of flickering candle lights and words of remembrance marked the 
one-year anniversary of the slaying of Manhattan Beach Police Officer Martin 
Ganz, who was shot during a traffic stop outside a local bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of residents, police officers, friends and family members of Ganz held 
candles as they walked Tuesday evening through city streets to the spot where 
Ganz was shot.There, officers remembered Ganz and mourned the slain officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think about it every day and we will for the rest of our lives," Manhattan 
Beach Officer John Loy said. "It's never going to end." 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz was a popular member of the force. The 29-year-old was about to be 
married when he was shot during a routine traffic stop as his 13-year-old 
nephew looked on. Months went by as authorities searched for Ganz's killer 
before a suspect was named in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Hoan Brady, jailed in Oregon in the slaying of a 55-year-old woman 
during a grocery store robbery, is also suspected of shooting Ganz. Brady faces 
murder charges in Ganz's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the candlelight vigil, the candle bearers were asked to 
extinguish the candles in Ganz's remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Tobias Steve, one of the first to arrive on the scene after Ganz was 
shot, was among those who blew out a flame. "It was very important to me to be 
here tonight," he said. "It meant a lot to me to see the support of the 
community." JAMES BENNING

 ALHAMBRA: A year after an innovative dispute-resolution class was initiated at 
Mark Keppel High School, Alhambra school officials plan to offer a similar 
class at the school district's two other high schools. The class, which focuses 
on teaching children ways of resolving problems without violence, will be 
taught at San Gabriel High and at Alhambra High this fall, said Supt.Heber 
Meeks. The class was started at Mark Keppel after racially charged fights 
between Asian American and Latino students.

 PASADENA: The Caltech Pre-College Science Initiative, which has worked with 
the Pasadena Unified School District to develop a hands-on, 
kindergarten-through-sixth-grade science program, has received a five-year 
grant of $6 million from the National Science Foundation that will enable it to 
expand the program into selected school districts throughout California. 
Scientists work with teachers to provide a course that emphasizes learning by 
investigating and in which students have the opportunity to create experiments 
and learn about science firsthand. With the grant, Caltech plans to target 
urban school districts throughout the state.

INTERNSHIPS ATTRACT DISPLACED WORKERS TO TEACHING CAREERS; EDUCATION: PROGRAM 
ALLOWS QUALIFYING CANDIDATES WITH COLLEGE DEGREES TO TEACH TEMPORARILY. TO 
ATTAIN FULL CREDENTIALS, THE INTERNS TAKE CLASSES AT CAL POLY POMONA. 
</P>

<P>
 Last summer, Jim Potichelli quit his job as an environmental engineer, took a 
sizable pay cut and went back to school full time, this time as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineering work just wasn't satisfying, Potichelli said. He long had thought 
about being a teacher, and when he heard about the Teach for Pomona internship 
program, he knew he couldn't pass up the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Potichelli is one of 44 professionals who are taking an alternate route to 
becoming teachers through the new internship program, which is sponsored by the 
Pomona Unified School District in conjunction with Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 The program puts the talents of displaced scientists, mathematicians and other 
victims of corporate downsizing to work in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, prospective teachers spend up to one year working as unpaid 
student teachers before teaching a class of their own. The internship program 
vastly speeds up the process for anyone who already holds a college degree: 
interns must pass an entrance exam and attend six weeks of intense instruction. 
Then they receive temporary credentials to teach. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first year of the Pomona program, which began when the school 
district received a state grant and contracted out to Cal Poly Pomona to assist 
in recruitment and to guarantee classes for interns. Interns complete all their 
course work at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher internships have been around since the 1950s, but the cooperation 
between a university and a school district is unique, said Greta Nagel, 
director of Teach for Pomona and a Cal Poly professor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pomona Unified School District hires 300 new teachers a year, but it still 
has a severe shortage of math, science and bilingual teachers, said William 
Graham, the school district's director of teaching-related staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sponsoring the intern program so we can handpick interns according to 
our needs," he said. "And, of course, because we got the grant." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Saccoman, a teacher specialist for the Pomona Unified School 
District, said people who had other careers make some of the best teachers 
because they can draw on their life experiences.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know what the real world is all about and it's messy," Potichelli said. 
"Science is not all theory, and I hope to show my students some practical ways 
to relate it to their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Potichelli, 27, is teaching earth science to 11th-and 12th-grade Garey High 
School students; for this, he took a $4,000-a-year pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching interns make the same entry-level salary of approximately $27,000 as 
do certified teachers. They are required to take one college class per quarter 
for two years and a full load during their summer break toward earning a 
teaching credential, Saccoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the participants have never taught before, others have 
struggled to break into the field for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Youshi L. Berry taught at parochial schools, which do not require a teaching 
credential, in Watts and south Los Angeles for several years. Berry, 39, wanted 
to teach in public schools but couldn't afford to make the transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who can afford to work (as a student teacher) for a year without pay?" she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry is currently teaching seventh-grade science at Fremont Junior High 
School and said teaching is more of a challenge than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traditional methods of teaching don't work anymore," she said. "We have 
to show kids how science and math are going to be important in their lives. It 
has to be relevant." 
</P>
<P>
 Damiana Aldana lost her English-as-a-second-language teaching position at Mt. 
San Antonio College because of budget cuts, but through the internship program, 
was able to stay in education. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldana is now teaching third- and fourth-graders primary Spanish at Washington 
Elementary School and said working with children is far more demanding than 
working with adults is. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, it's been really challenging," she said. "Just trying to get them to 
form a line is a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Saccoman said the district expects to retain 90% of its intern teachers 
because of help from credentialed volunteer teachers who act as mentors and 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches really make a difference," she said. "The interns also see each 
other at their weekly class, which is added support and feedback."

SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY; KEEPING AN OPEN MIND; SENIORS WHO AREN'T READY FOR THE 
ROCKING CHAIR ARE ENROLLING IN A MINI-COLLEGE FOR RETIREES WHO STILL YEARN TO 
LEARN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ethel Allen doesn't want any part of the bingo games and sing-alongs that 
stereotype many people's retirements. She'd rather study Islamic culture or the 
science of chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have senior citizens centers where they treat you like a baby and talk 
to you like you are 3 years old -- so you begin to think that you are," the 
68-year-old Palos Verdes resident says. 
</P>
<P>
 To find more stimulating conversation, three years ago she joined a tiny South 
Bay study group that eventually developed into Omnilore, a mini-college for 
retirees that now meets at Knob Hill Community Center in Redondo Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Part of a national trend that has seen the number of these mini-colleges 
triple in six years, Omnilore now has nearly 100 members. Increasingly, retired 
people, who are healthier and living longer than ever before, are forming 
groups that will provide companionship and intellectual stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think sitting around and doing nothing is very debilitating," says Francis 
Meyers, president emeritus of the Assn. of Learning in Retirement Organizations 
of the West.  
</P>
<P>
 Meyers has participated in the UCLA Plato Society, one of the first retiree 
learning organizations, for 14 years. He says the group has been a crucial part 
of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kept me alive, frankly. It's kept my mind going. I am constantly studying, 
reading, discussing and teaching and so forth," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 At Omnilore, the entire membership chooses six or eight themes by ballot. Each 
discussion group, usually eight to 15 members, studies one of those themes. The 
group has no teachers -- members take responsibility for researching an aspect 
of the chosen theme. There are no tests or grades.  
</P>
<P>
 Members say the mini-colleges function at about the same level as graduate 
school courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Omnilore members put in 30 or more hours preparing for a half-hour 
presentation on each topic. Each group meets twice a month, and typically each 
meeting has two presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 It's what the presentations stir up that members prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it comes down to is you want to get some good discussion going instead 
of lectures," says Virginia Engstrom, 57, who recently took a course on human 
nature. Engstrom, retired from Xerox Corp., says she keeps active, going 
sailing with her husband and spending time with their grown children. But 
Omnilore helps her keep up to date on current topics. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members find the give-and-take in the group stimulating.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you have something controversial, that gets everyone hot under the collar, 
and you are so busy doing that, you don't have time to be old -- and that's 
good," says Allen, who takes time out from playing with the Palos Verdes 
Symphony Band and activities with the Great Books Foundation to study for 
Omnilore classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the mental stimulation, the courses offer access to a group of people 
interested in many subjects.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you are working, you are surrounded by a peer group that is pretty much 
like you," Engstrom says, adding that in retirement it's harder to find people 
who have similar interests. "You do end up searching around for people that are 
like you."  
</P>
<P>
 Participants also use the courses to learn about things they never knew much 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me it's a big catch-up," says Burt Cutler, 80, who established and ran an 
educational products company. His firm created GeoSafari, an electronic 
learning device that's sold all over the world. But because he was on a career 
track during high school and college, finishing his engineering degree as 
quickly as possible was his main concern. He says he skipped most of the 
courses in Western civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never even knew the name Herodotus -- let alone reading Herodotus," Cutler 
says of the ancient Greek historian. Now he stays away from the courses that he 
knows anything about, preferring to fill in the gaps in his studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know 20 or 30 times what I knew five years ago," Cutler says. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen says that because she was a music student in college, she stayed away 
from math and science, fearing it would bring her grade-point average down. But 
now, free of grades and tests, she relishes exploring new things. 
</P>
<P>
 She has read British physicist Stephen Hawking's book "A Brief History of 
Time" and studied the science of chaos -- the idea that mathematical order 
underlies what appear to be random phenomena.  
</P>
<P>
 For one of her presentations, Allen taught the class about Mobius strips -- 
surfaces with only one side, formed by giving a half-twist to a narrow 
rectangular strip of paper and then pasting its two ends together. 
Mathematicians use the strips to prove that a three-dimensional object can have 
only one side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned things I couldn't imagine I would have done before," Allen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the topics can sound intimidating, Omnilore members say the only 
thing a good participant needs to have is intellectual curiosity and a 
willingness to do the reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have ridden in taxis where I have thought I would like to bring the driver 
to Omnilore -- it's not their background but that they're a thinker," Cutler 
says. "All it really takes is a desire to read and to discuss and to grow."  
</P>
<P>
 Few subjects are taboo among members. Although there are no hard-and-fast 
rules, Allen says, the group frowns on talking about grandchildren and 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do that around the coffeepot, but we don't do it around the discussion 
table," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three years since that first group met, they've had sessions on 
subjects such as John Naisbitt's book "Megatrends," humorous journalists, 
genealogy, the new Russia, London and famous economists. 
</P>
<P>
 Topics for this spring include the philosopher Nietzsche, the great composers, 
evolution and the Roman Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 For a course on human nature, Daryl Creighton, 66, recently gave a talk on the 
influence of Charles Darwin's evolution theories on the development of 
political conservatism and liberalism. Standing at the chalkboard, he diagramed 
how political opinion split into two camps when Darwin's theories became well 
known: the God-fearing who rejected his postulates and those who accepted 
evolution. Every few minutes, group members interjected with a question, 
criticism or comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Having done a lot of presentations in his job as an engineer at McDonnell 
Douglas, Creighton easily fielded the remarks and kept the discussion moving. 
Part of that ease comes from knowing the subject. Facing a roomful of 
engineers, lawyers, teachers and other professionals keeps him on his toes, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are pretty sharp. You don't want to put anything out there that 
you are going to get killed on," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And although they aren't shy with their opinions, the groups don't really get 
mad or yell, Creighton says. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the retired professionals know how to run a meeting, but for some, 
facing a room full of critical thinkers can be intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new ones learn how to do a little bit of crowd control," Engstrom says. 
</P>
<P>
 The give-and-take discussions form bonds among the participants, they say, and 
the deadlines for reading and informing the group keep them going. Engstrom 
says having specific meeting dates keeps her motivated and enthusiastic. "I 
have always really enjoyed researching things and learning new things. But I'm 
also like most people -- a little on the lazy side." 
</P>
<P>
 Omnilore got its start three years ago when Cutler mailed a flyer to members 
of the local League of Women Voters, inviting people to join a new 
organization. Cutler had been to meetings at UCLA's Plato Society and liked the 
concept, but couldn't face commuting to Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 people came to the first sessions, which were held in private homes. 
Because the Middle East was in the news, the group's first topic was Islam. A 
UCLA professor recommended a good reference text, and they were off and 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a year they were ready to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "In people's homes it lacks a certain discipline -- that's dabbling," says 
Allen. After consulting with UCLA's Plato Society, which has offered the same 
type of seminars since 1980, the group approached Cal State Dominguez Hills for 
sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the retirees' mini-colleges affiliate with colleges and universities. 
The schools offer their meeting rooms and audit the groups' books. The 
participants pay $75 for one person and $125 for two, which covers the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Omnilore is a member of the Elder Hostel Institute Network, which has 
supported retirement learning groups across the country since 1988. The 
institute started with 70 groups, and by their reckoning, there are more than 
200 in the country today, says Jim Verschueren, the institute's director. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few years with only discussion groups, typically the organizations 
branch out, Verschueren says. UCLA's Plato Society allows some undergraduates 
to participate in sessions and get credit for it. Other groups invite the 
retirees to give lectures on their professional or life experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen says she hopes that someday Omnilore will branch out as similar 
organizations have, and members will study alongside Cal State Dominguez Hills 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice for the young people to see that old folks are not doddering around 
on a cane," she says.

 ALTADENA: Members of the sheriff's bomb squad safely detonated a pipe bomb 
found Monday in a wash near a home. A man hiking about 5:10 p.m. found a tote 
bag, carried the bag to a friend's nearby house in the 500 block of Villa 
Zanita Street and found what looked like a bomb.Investigators confirmed that it 
was a bomb and blew it up in a nearby open area.  
</P>
<P>
 ALTADENA: A 23-year-old Altadena man was critically wounded Monday when he was 
shot while in his car. The man, whose name was not released, was shot about 2 
p.m. in the 600 block of Ventura Street. He was shot at least twice in the 
upper body and was taken to a local hospital, sheriff's deputies said. 
Investigators had no one in custody and did not know if the shooting was 
gang-related.

 WEST COVINA: A 44-year-old Tennessee man was arrested Friday morning after 
allegedly firing several shotgun blasts into a state employment office and at 
passing cars. Frederick Kunz was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon, shooting at an inhabited dwelling and shooting at a moving vehicle. The 
incident occurred about 7:30 a.m. Police said Kunz, who uses a wheelchair, 
apparently was disgruntled about not receiving disability benefits. Kunz had 
moved to California from Tennessee, and reportedly had an appointment for later 
that morning at the employment office. LISA O'NEILL

DOCTOR FACES ARRAIGNMENT ON ASSAULT COUNTS

<P>
 A 31-year-old doctor at Huntington Memorial Hospital is to be arraigned Friday 
on felony charges of sexually assaulting two women patients in the hospital 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pezhman Ebrahimzadeh, a resident in surgery at the Pasadena hospital, faces 
proceedings in Pasadena Superior Court on charges of rape with a foreign object 
and sexual battery.  
</P>
<P>
 A lengthy preliminary hearing that ended Dec. 15 included tearful testimony 
from the two victims, a 33-year-old married woman and a 27-year-old single 
woman, Pasadena Police Detective Bud Ireland said. The women's names were 
withheld at their request, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a possibility there might be other victims," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1990 graduate of Rush Medical Center in Chicago and a former County-USC 
Medical Center resident, Ebrahimzadeh began working at the Pasadena hospital in 
July, 1993, as a surgical resident, Ireland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal accusations against him arose in October, 1993, when the 
33-year-old woman reported to police that she was attacked when she came to the 
hospital emergency room for treatment and Ebrahimzadeh was called to examine 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1994, in the midst of the police investigation, the 27-year-old 
woman came forward. The woman said she had been assaulted in July, 1993, when 
she came to the hospital for an outpatient checkup, but that she had never 
reported the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Months after the alleged assault, the woman told police, she had entered the 
hospital, seen Ebrahimzadeh's photograph on the wall among those of other 
doctors and finally confided to a friend that she had been attacked, Ireland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're attacked by a doctor, there's an element of doubt, that it really 
didn't happen," Ireland said, explaining the woman's delay. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebrahimzadeh is no longer working at Huntington and is free on $50,000 bail 
awaiting trial. His attorney, Charles English, did not return calls seeking 
comment.

 In Rich Grant's family, his chestnut-colored cowlick is known as the "Grant

Also from his father's side of the family -- the "mono-brow."

 This is how leukemia patient Kim Bubb, 38, says she recognized the stranger 
who saved her life, as soon as she laid eyes on him this summer. Bubb swears 
that she, too, inherited the Grant wave and the mono-brow -- right after she 
got three pints of his bone marrow in a transplant April, 1993, at the City of 
Hope National Medical Center in Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
 Her doctor gently disputes that notion, attributing the changes to intense 
chemotherapy before the transplant. Bone marrow recipients get the donor's 
blood and immune system, not the person's looks or characteristics, said Dr. 
Pablo Miguel Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Bubb, the looks go along with the kinship that has developed with her 
donor. She got more than just a second chance at life, she says. She got a fast 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The two first met at a City of Hope picnic for bone marrow transplant 
survivors in July -- he, a churchgoing, suit-wearing suburban family man; she, 
a blithe mountain-dwelling spirit in sweats and high-tops, who talks nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's my hero, he's my friend, he's more than that," said Bubb, who lives near 
Big Bear in Crestline. "I haven't really found the right words. . . . We are on 
our way to becoming a little family." 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow, (she's) more than just a friend," said Grant, who lives in Mission 
Viejo with his wife and 14-month-old daughter. It's "a family connection. 
There's a definite bond there." 
</P>
<P>
 Every few weeks, Bubb, who is now cancer free, talks with Grant by telephone. 
In October, they gave a speech together to a women's group in Crestline about 
the importance of blood donations for bone marrow testing. Afterward, Grant 
dropped by her house to visit. As a holiday present, Bubb recently gave Grant 
-- who has a sweet tooth -- a homemade fudge-covered apple wrapped in red 
cellophane paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone marrow recipients sometimes don't meet the strangers who save their lives 
because of a privacy desire on either side or because they live far away from 
each other, said Jennifer D. Caliandro, a spokeswoman for the National Marrow 
Donor Program in Minneapolis. The national registry does not keep statistics on 
how many donors and recipients meet, she said. Under registry rules, donors and 
recipients must wait one year -- the patient's critical recovery period -- 
before contacting each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubb could not wait. She thought about her donor continually. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, on the day that the waiting period expired, she filled out paperwork 
to hook up with her donor. A couple of weeks later, she got his name and office 
phone number from the registry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, Rich," she said nervously into his answering machine. "My name is Kim. 
You don't know me, but you are my hero. You are the man who saved my life." 
</P>
<P>
 He called back that night. They talked for nearly an hour about the fate that 
had brought them together. The Leukemia Patient 
</P>
<P>
 Before all of this began, Bubb was living in her dream place in Phoenix. She 
had planned to live forever in her three-bedroom, ranch-style home with a pool, 
fireplace and huge back porch. She worked as an office manager for a paint and 
body shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Life was peachy for the Louisiana native. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the night sweats started. Heavy nosebleeds. Fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Early menopause, she thought. She was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1991, she was found to have chronic myelogenous leukemia, a 
life-threatening cancer. Her doctor put her life expectancy at three to five 
years and said only a bone marrow transplant could save her. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm dying, Bubb thought. This is judgment day. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubb read a three-page pamphlet on bone marrow transplants that said there is 
only a one-in-20,000 shot of finding an unrelated donor. And even with a 
transplant, survival rates hovered in the 30% to 60% range. 
</P>
<P>
 The odds were hopelessly against her, thought Bubb, who had considered herself 
so unlucky that she had never even bought a lottery ticket. The only prize she 
had ever won was a live turkey when she was attending cosmetology school in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of her relatives got their blood tested, but none of them had matching 
bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1991, Bubb thought her luck had changed. It had -- for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
 She got a call saying that the national registry had found a match, a 
36-year-old female with the same bone marrow makeup as hers. Bubb packed her 
bags, ready to go to the hospital at a moment's notice. Two weeks later, her 
hopes crashed. The donor had backed out, for unknown reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 More bad news that week: Bubb, who had quit work in August because of her 
failing health, also lost her insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a donor, I had insurance . . . she changed her mind. It was all bam bam 
bam bam bam! My one-in-20,000 chance just passed in front of my face, and I was 
going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 She decided to move to California, so she could receive treatment at the City 
of Hope, the country's second-largest bone marrow transplant center after the 
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Bubb was able to get Medi-Cal and Medicaid, and live near the 
mountains in tiny Crestline, where a bear or two sometimes wanders through 
town. In May, 1992, Bubb and her best friend, Debbie Young, moved to a rented 
wood-frame cottage made of knotty pine, with two cocker spaniels -- Sappho, 
named after a Greek poet, and Buddy, short for Rose Bud. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubb is a stubborn sort, a high-spirited prankster whose doctor peers around 
the corner when she's around, knowing she might ding him with a flying rubber 
glove. She is a fighter, taping most of her doctor visits so she can be sure to 
remember his advice. But she is also a realist. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was going to die, and I had to move, by golly, I wanted to be somewhere 
where I wanted to go, where I look out the window and I see beauty," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clock was ticking. Without a donor, she would die. 
</P>
<P>
 To pass the time, she started to fish, rising at 4 a.m. to beat the locals to 
the best fishing holes at nearby Lake Gregory. Four or five days a week, she 
fished for trout until dark, sometimes from shore with synthetic, gooey Power 
Bait, sometimes off a boat with lures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't think I had any chance, and I was fishing my brains out. . . 
. I wasn't looking for the phone call any more (about a donor). . . . My dying 
was for the best, I had convinced myself of that." 
</P>
<P>
 And then in December, 1992, another call came. There was a match. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, her eyes water, just thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know how miraculous it is for me to have another donor match?" she 
asked. "I am meant to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 On March 29, 1993, Bubb was admitted to the City of Hope for a bone marrow 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 First, she underwent four days of intense radiation and chemotherapy to kill 
cancerous cells, a process that also destroys bone marrow function. Bone marrow 
is the tissue that manufactures parts of the blood and immune system, including 
white blood cells, which fight off infection. After a transplant, the new 
marrow restores the patient's damaged bone marrow and immune system. The makeup 
of the donated marrow must match, or the patient's body will reject it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With no immune system, Bubb waited in isolation for her new marrow. The 
donated marrow -- a red, jelly-like fluid -- is transfused directly into the 
bloodstream, much like a blood transfusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Right before the transplant, a nurse handed Bubb her donor's bone marrow, in 
three bags, to hold for a precious second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I held my life in my hands," Bubb said, shaking her head in wonder. "It was a 
feeling you cannot even imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 Bubb's transplant took six hours. Seven weeks later, she went home. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she wondered about her donor, who she knew was a young American 
male. She imagined him as big, because he seemed to have a lot of bone marrow. 
And he must be hairy, she thought, because her own hair grew back thicker after 
the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't want to refer to him impersonally as her "donor." So she made up a 
name for him -- "Dave." 
</P>
<P>
 "So, for a year," Bubb said, "it was 'Dave and I.' " The Bone Marrow Donor 
</P>
<P>
 In college, Rich Grant got into the habit of donating blood. He was a 
managerial economics major at UC Davis, apt to drop into the campus blood 
center for the free doughnuts and coffee as much for the civic duty, he jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 After college, he worked for Wells Fargo's commercial banking department, 
before joining Heller First Capital Corp. in August, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1992, Grant got a memo at his San Francisco office. The memo 
suggested that employees consider testing their blood for the national bone 
marrow registry. 
</P>
<P>
 He signed up. He had no idea what a bone marrow transplant involved. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1993, he got a call on his office's automated answering system 
from his local blood center. His bone marrow was a potential match with that of 
a dying woman. After more tests at Irwin Memorial Blood Center in San 
Francisco, there was no doubt. He matched. 
</P>
<P>
 At the blood center, officials met with Grant and his 30-year-old wife, 
Colleen, and explained the simple surgical procedure, which is paid for by the 
recipient's insurance. Under general anesthesia, 2% to 5% of the donor's liquid 
marrow is extracted from the hip area through a special needle and syringe. 
</P>
<P>
 The donor stays in the hospital overnight for observation. After the 
procedure, the donor's lower back area is sore. But the pain is gone within a 
week, and the donor's marrow replenishes itself within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant had never been hospitalized before. He was in good shape, a weekend 
rugby player, who ran every morning with his golden retriever and Labrador 
retriever. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no point along the way did I ever say, 'Am I doing the right thing?' It 
was really a very easy decision to make -- to save someone's life." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, a nurse, was proud of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never crossed my mind that he wouldn't do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1993, Grant underwent the 20-minute surgical procedure at the UC San 
Francisco Medical Center. Afterward, in his hospital room, he talked with his 
roommate, a lymphoma patient. The 45-year-old father was very sick after 
chemotherapy treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That made it much more complete," Grant said. "For me to see his reaction to 
what I had done, and his wife's, the look on their faces . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Grant recuperated at home. He was sore, but up and around, and 
back at work two days after surgery. The surgery left him with six pockmarklike 
scars on the back of his hip. 
</P>
<P>
 "This put a lot in perspective," said Grant, on a recent afternoon at home, 
holding his daughter, Brianna. "Every once in awhile, I'll get mired down in a 
deal I'm working on, and I'll just say, 'How important is this when somebody . 
. . is trying to fight leukemia? This is so small, compared to that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Grant, his wife and newborn moved to Laguna Niguel, after a company 
transfer. In October, they moved to a new three-bedroom condominium in Mission 
Viejo.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he thought about the leukemia patient who had his bone marrow. Did 
she have kids? Where did she live? Did she have someone to support her through 
the transplant? 
</P>
<P>
 Through his local blood center, he got occasional updates, and sometimes said 
a prayer for her. He forgot about it for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 One year after the transplant, she floated through his thoughts again. Then he 
got the voice message from her at work, about how he was her hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty warm and fuzzy feeling," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 When he called back, the first thing she wanted to know was what he looked 
like. They joked that they had the same hair. 
</P>
<P>
 They talked about meeting up at the City of Hope picnic in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 He hung up and made sure his wife had the day off for the picnic. The Two 
Friends 
</P>
<P>
 Bubb knew it was him, right away. 
</P>
<P>
 They had agreed to meet at the City of Hope fountain, at 11 a.m., right before 
the picnic. The Grants and their baby were running late. Meanwhile, Bubb 
waited, scanning the faces of passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
 She spotted him, 200 feet away, among hundreds of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my donor," she told her roommate. "I know it's him." 
</P>
<P>
 Each made eye contact with one another. And then they both started for each 
other, arms outstretched. No introductions necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a movie," Bubb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately, Grant's wife noticed a resemblance between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 "First thing I noticed was the hair," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The picnic drew 1,300 bone marrow transplant recipients but only two donors, 
including Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubb told Grant she had a gift for him. How nice, he thought. Maybe a necktie. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Bubb got up before the crowd and announced that she had written an 
18-line poem for her donor, called "Soul Mate, Unknown." The ending: 
</P>
<P>
 "God's caring love is ours to share  
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Him we've become a  
</P>
<P>
 pair.  
</P>
<P>
 So thank you Rich for each new  
</P>
<P>
 day,  
</P>
<P>
 You've kissed the hurt and made it  
</P>
<P>
 go away."  
</P>
<P>
 When she finished, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. Later, she gave Grant 
a framed copy, typed on peach-colored paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant was overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was able to put into words everything she went through," he marveled. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bubb feels good, although she is easily winded doing simple chores, from 
her medication and her body's adjustment to the new marrow. She still takes 41 
pills daily, mostly to keep her body from rejecting the new bone marrow. As 
soon as her strength returns, Bubb plans to find a job, or, inspired by her 
nurses, will return to school to study nursing. Meanwhile, she gets by on 
disability income. 
</P>
<P>
 Every few weeks, she sees her doctor, who adjusts her medication and monitors 
her progress. And then she calls Grant, to tell him what her doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 If they hadn't met, Bubb says, the question, "Who saved my life?" would have 
bothered her forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would've broken my heart," she said, on a recent chilly afternoon, curled 
up on the couch in front of her wood-burning fireplace with her two snoring 
dogs. "It kind of helped bring it all together . . . it just made it a complete 
circle."

MENTAL WORKOUTS MAY AID HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Studying and discussing ideas may have something to do with people's physical 
as well as mental health. Recently, scientists have suggested that exercising 
the intellect helps keep older people healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most dramatic evidence has come from a study of elderly nuns done 
by the University of Kentucky.  
</P>
<P>
 The School Sisters of Notre Dame, a Catholic order numbering more than 670 
women, agreed to donate their brains for post-mortem examination and allowed 
researchers to review their lifetime health records. 
</P>
<P>
 The subjects of the study come from two groups of nuns in seven U.S. cities, 
teachers and domestic workers. Dr. David Snowden has been evaluating the 
participants every year for nearly a decade. He believes higher levels of 
mental activity appear to be related to longevity with good mental and physical 
functioning. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the oldest subjects, a 102-year-old nun, was alert and functioning well 
until the day she died, with no symptoms of serious illness. But an autopsy 
revealed that her brain was riddled with Alzheimer's disease. She was one of 
the most intellectually active members of the order. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scientific findings show that exercise, weightlifting and other physical 
activities help people maintain the functions they need to maintain their 
independence," Snowden says. "Wouldn't it be nice if brain cells turned out to 
behave like muscle cells -- that if you keep mentally active, your brain will 
function optimally for a longer time."

UNSELFISH ACTS BY THE UNRELATED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Transplant survivors who get bone marrow donations from strangers call 
themselves MUDS, which stands for Marrow from an Unrelated Donor Source. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a small, bittersweet fraternity of people, bound by the kindness of 
strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1992, Arcadia resident Kathy Novell was one of those strangers, a 
donor to a dying man whose bone marrow matched hers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing, it's so simple," said Novell, 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Novell, a speech pathologist with three small children, never met her 
recipient, a 42-year-old man with leukemia, who died a year after the 
transplant from a related heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd do it again, in a minute," she said. "The thing is, what if it was my 
kid? What if it was my family? . . . It may be you sometime." 
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of patients who need bone marrow transplants have a family member -- 
usually a sibling -- who is an exact immunological match, while the remainder 
seek unrelated donors through the National Marrow Donor Program in Minneapolis. 
The national registry has 1.4 million potential donors on file. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1987, there have been 3,000 bone marrow transplants using unrelated 
donors, according to the national registry. Transplants from unrelated bone 
marrow donors began in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, about 5,000 people receive bone marrow transplants, while 5,000 to 
15,000 more die because of a lack of matching donors. Survival rates for 
transplant patients who get bone marrow from unrelated donors range from 30% to 
60%. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the issue of bone marrow donation was championed through the 
much-publicized story of Anissa Ayala, a Walnut teen-ager with leukemia. After 
a nationwide search for an unrelated donor failed, Ayala's parents conceived a 
child in a successful attempt to find a bone marrow match for their daughter, a 
patient at the City of Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent news reports on a promising new technique for bone marrow transplants 
is giving hope to the roughly 9,000 people in the country who are searching for 
unrelated marrow donors. Italian and Israeli researchers say the technique for 
performing bone marrow transplants could make it easier for family members of 
leukemia patients to serve as donors. The technique would eliminate the current 
need for the precise immunological matching between a donor and recipient.

CITIES JOINING TALKS ON POWER CONSORTIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like coup plotters, officials from area cities have gathered every two weeks 
or so in the back room of a Culver City restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, tentatively called the South Bay Joint Powers Consortium, is 
studying whether to join forces and demand lower electric rates from Southern 
California Edison. And if the electric industry becomes deregulated -- 
something that now is being considered by the California Public Utilities 
Commission -- the group would buy power in bulk from the least expensive 
supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is still in the early stages of discussion, and cities taking part in 
those talks have by no means committed to the project. But at a meeting earlier 
this month at Geo Petrelli's Steak House, there were signs that the effort is 
stirring broad interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign-in list included the names of officials from several cities -- such 
as Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Redondo Beach, Burbank and Rolling Hills -- 
that had not previously taken part in the talks. Officials from nine cities 
have been involved in the discussions since the idea first surfaced early in 
the fall -- Culver City, Hawthorne, Inglewood, Lawndale, Gardena, Carson, 
Torrance, El Segundo and Lomita. 
</P>
<P>
 A sample joint powers agreement, which would formalize the cities' 
participation in the consortium, was distributed. But getting city officials to 
sign such an agreement could be a challenge. So far, only Culver City, Carson, 
Hawthorne and Lomita have formally expressed support for the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 And prospective new members are clearly keeping their options open. "It may 
work for other cities, but I'm not sure it would work in Beverly Hills," said 
Dan Webster, city director of public service. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy consultants, investment bankers and representatives of the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power also attended the meeting. Edison officials have 
been meeting with officials from some of the cities discussing the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one city official seemed receptive. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Edison) does a lot in our city," said Lomita Councilman Dave Albert. 
"They're charging us a little too much money, but they're bringing us an olive 
branch. I think we should try and negotiate, not go in there fighting." MARY

WHALE SIGHTINGS KEEP CENTER VOLUNTEERS BUSY

 Compass readings yelled out at the Point Vicente Interpretive Center in Rancho 
Palos Verdes are no longer for military maneuvers at the former shooting range. 
Volunteers are tracking gray whales. 
</P>
<P>
 Whale watching season began this month, and as of last week, volunteers say 
they have spotted 28 whales, twice as many as the same time last year, as they 
migrate from Alaska to the warm waters of Baja to mate and give birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was seeming to indicate, as much as you can predict these things, that 
we'll have a good whale-watching season," said Carol Carson, the whale watch 
coordinator for the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson could not offer an explanation for the heavy turnout. "Being wild, they 
do what they want to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 24,000 whales make the annual journey, but last year, Point 
Vicente observers spotted only about 2,000. The rest of the whales go around 
Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 From December to May, volunteers staff the interpretive center's balcony from 
dawn to dusk, seven days a week, looking for the 40-ton, 40-foot-long mammals 
as they spray, jump and dive their way south. 
</P>
<P>
 When volunteers spot whales, they yell out the compass readings found on their 
$800 Fujinon marine binoculars so that others can verify the sightings. JEFF

<P>
 The National Marrow Donor Program helps patients with leukemia or other blood 
diseases find matching, unrelated bone marrow donors for transplants. 
Information: (800) MARROW2. 
</P>
<P>
 The City of Hope has the country's second-largest bone marrow transplant 
center. It is affiliated with the national registry, so people who donate blood 
at the City of Hope are screened for potential matches with bone marrow 
transplant candidates nationwide. Information: (818) 301-8386. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors must be 18 to 56 years old and in good health. The process: 
</P>
<P>
 * A small amount of blood is taken from the donor at an approved site. 
</P>
<P>
 * The sample is analyzed for markers on the surface of white blood cells 
called "antigens." The results are entered in the national registry. 
</P>
<P>
 * If two of the donor's key antigens match those of a patient in the registry, 
the donor is asked to give another small sample of blood. Four more of the 
donor's antigens are typed and compared to the patient's. 
</P>
<P>
 * If all six antigens match, the donor is counseled about the donation process 
and given a physical examination. Donors who wish to proceed sign an "intent to 
donate" form. All expenses are paid by the recipient's insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Donated marrow is extracted in a simple surgical procedure under general 
anesthesia at an approved hospital. Doctors extract 2% to 5% of the donor's 
liquid marrow from the back of the pelvis with a special needle and syringe. 
</P>
<P>
 * The donor is kept in the hospital overnight for observation. 
</P>
<P>
 * After the procedure, the donor's lower back area is sore for about a week. 
The donor's marrow replenishes itself within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * After a year, the registry sends consent forms to both the donor and 
recipient, asking whether or not they want contact with the other. RENEE TAWA

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: FULL PLATES ON NEW YEAR'S EVE

<P>
 If you want to celebrate New Year's Eve without enduring the dumb snacks and 
drunken fools that mar so many parties, consider going to a restaurant. As 
usual, some of the top South Bay restaurants will be preparing special 
offerings for New Year's Eve.  
</P>
<P>
 At The Depot in Old Torrance, chef Michael Shafer is offering several specials 
for New Year's Eve. One is a barbecued New York steak ($19.95) basted with 
Shafer's own Thai sauce: rice vinegar, fresh ginger, garlic, cilantro, brown 
sugar, tomato paste and both sesame oil and sesame seeds. The steak is sliced 
and fanned out over a mound of shiitake, oyster and tree mushrooms, carrots and 
red bell peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Peppered swordfish ($19.95) comes with hoppin' John, the traditional Southern 
New Year's Day stew of rice, black-eyed peas, vegetables and Creole seasonings. 
In the style of chef Daniel Boulud, who gained fame at his New York restaurant 
Le Cirque for serving a black sea bass with a red wine sauce, chef Shafer 
lavishes grilled albacore tuna ($17.95) with a red wine reduction heady with 
porcini mushrooms. The fish is accompanied with pecan corn bread dressing.  
</P>
<P>
 Over at the little Palette Cafe, nearly hidden in the shadow of the large 
Gable House bowling alley, chef Tom Kamijo will prepare a three-course dinner 
for $27.50. The meal begins with a choice of sauteed oysters in black bean 
sauce, shrimp cake in fennel cream, or a pate of venison, foie gras and 
truffles with apple chutney. Main course highlights include lobster, scallops 
and shiitake ravioli with a rich lobster sauce, or a roasted rack of lamb with 
Cabernet sauce and goat cheese mashed potatoes. For dessert, there's pumpkin 
pudding and a pear cake with assorted fresh fruits. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I can't guarantee there won't be any drunken fools at either place, but 
the chances of getting a good meal are very good. And you can be safe at home 
in time to ring in the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Depot is at 1250 Cabrillo St., Torrance, (310) 787-7501. Open Monday 
through Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and Tuesday through Sunday, 5:30 to 11 
p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 The Palette Cafe is at 22549 Hawthorne Blvd., Torrance. (310) 373-7055. Open 
Tuesday through Saturday, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday, 5:50 
to 9:30 p.m.

 TO THE POINT 
</P>
<P>
 It was always said that Paul Pierce, despite earning his basketball notoriety 
playing forward, possessed the skills to play point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Inglewood High senior is proving it. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-7 Pierce, a preseason All-American and one of the nation's top 
college recruits, has moved to point guard this season to help fill the void 
created by the graduation of Sam Turks, the Sentinels' floor leader the past 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised if the move becomes permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood Coach Pat Roy said college coaches have told him that Pierce's 
future could be at point guard. And Pierce likes his new position. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves it," Roy said. "He does a great job of seeing the floor and 
distributing the ball. It's an asset for us. He attracts all the defenders, 
which leaves other players open for shots." 
</P>
<P>
 With Pierce running the show, Inglewood (8-2) is off to an impressive start. 
The Sentinels placed third last week in the Las Vegas Prep Classic, which 
featured 50 teams from across the country, and they beat Long Beach Poly, 
56-53, Tuesday to reach tonight's semifinals of the Artesia tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the added responsibilities of ballhandling, Pierce entered the week 
averaging 24 points and 11 rebounds a game, in addition to leading the team in 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter where he's at (on defense)," Roy said. "When a shot is 
taken, he's right back on the board. That has contributed to our success; we 
can rebound with most good teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, the only returning starter from last season's 30-4 team, is joined in 
the starting lineup by junior guard Jan Thomas, a transfer from Westchester who 
has emerged as Inglewood's No. 2 scoring threat, junior forwards Deandre Tanner 
and Reggie Price, and 6-5 senior center Kevin Elliott. Antoine Young, a senior 
forward who came out late because of football, and senior guards Carlo Calhoun 
and Ray Dunning are the top reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 But it all begins and ends with Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has stepped up his game to another level," Roy said. "It's a major 
adjustment to go from (power forward or center) to point guard. That's tough to 
do. He's still learning the position, but as time goes on he's just going to 
get better and better." NATIONAL EXPOSURE 
</P>
<P>
 Roy is beginning to wonder what Inglewood has to do to break into the national 
rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels went 5-1 in the Las Vegas tournament, including victories over 
nationally ranked Westchester and Compton Dominguez. But when the latest 
rankings were published Tuesday, Inglewood was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were going to be in the (USA Today) top 25," Roy said. "If we 
can win (the Artesia) tournament, I definitely think they will slide us up in 
there somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester, which lost to Inglewood, 66-57, at Las Vegas after beating the 
Sentinels in double overtime Dec. 9, is ranked 21st by USA Today. Dominguez, 
which squandered a 23-2 lead in a 61-54 loss to Inglewood at Las Vegas, is 
ranked 13th in a poll conducted by a national panel of sportswriters and 14th 
by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood's only loss at Las Vegas was to Oak Hill Academy of Mouth of Wilson, 
Va., which shut down Pierce en route to a 77-55 semifinal victory. Oak Hill, 
ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA Today and boasting two preseason 
All-Americans in 6-7 forward Ray Mercer and 6-9 center Melvin Whitaker, beat 
Mater Dei in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament ended on an upbeat note for Inglewood, which defeated Dunbar of 
Washington, D.C., 80-76, in the third-place game. Pierce led the Sentinels with 
21 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood begins defense of its Bay League title at home Wednesday night at 
7:30 against Santa Monica. PILOT POLITICS 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Paculba, beaten down by continued criticism from the Banning High booster 
club, resigned last week after three seasons as the Pilots' football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, the stage is set for the boosters to finally get their man. Former 
Banning Coach Chris Ferragamo has been earmarked by the boosters to take over 
the program, although he isn't sure he wants the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know what's going to happen," Ferragamo said Wednesday. "I'd like 
to come back and do some coaching, but the situation would have to be just 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Other possible candidates include Ken Stumpf, Banning's defensive coordinator 
the past three seasons and a former head coach at Washington High, and Ed 
Barreras, coach of the Pilot sophomore team. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's no secret that Ferragamo, a longtime science teacher at Banning, is 
the favorite with people in the Wilmington community who long for the "good old 
days." Ferragamo, who turned 54 Tuesday, guided Banning to eight City Section 
titles from 1969-86, including an unprecedented six in row from 1976-81, 
finishing with a 157-36-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferragamo's name surfaced after the 1993 season when the boosters circulated a 
petition calling for Paculba's removal. But Banning Principal Bea Lamothe stuck 
by her coach and Paculba decided to stick it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Banning had its best playoff performance under Paculba in 1994, finishing 
6-5-1 after losing to eventual City Section 4-A Division champion Sylmar in 
overtime in the quarterfinals. But for the boosters, that wasn't much better 
than the Pilots' first-round exits in their first two seasons under Paculba. 
</P>
<P>
 Paculba could not be reached for comment. His teams were 18-15-1, but only 1-3 
in the playoffs. PREP NOTEBOOK 
</P>
<P>
 * Mira Costa tailback Michael Fikes, who helped the Mustangs reach the 
Southern Section Division VII final for the second consecutive season, has been 
named Division VII player of the year by a panel of sportswriters. Fikes, The 
Times' South Bay back of the year, led the area with 2,610 total yards and 22 
touchdowns. . . . Carson's Joseph (J.R.) Redmond was named to Cal-Hi Sports' 
All-State first team as a defensive back. Four area players were named to the 
second-team defense: Banning lineman John Toavalu, Leuzinger linebacker Aaron 
Williams and defensive backs Ademole Turner of Serra and Kelvin Hunter of 
Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Peninsula girls' basketball team began play Wednesday in the Lady Tiger 
Holiday Classic in Pickerington, Ohio, an eight-team tournament that includes 
four teams ranked in the nation's top 15 by USA Today: No. 1 Oregon City, Ore.; 
No. 2 Pickerington, No. 4 Christ the King of New York City, and No. 15 Harrison 
Central of Gulfport, Miss. Peninsula opened against Christ the King, which it 
beat in 1991-92 on the way to a 33-0 record and the mythical national title. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former Torrance standout Jessica Reifer, a junior midfielder for the 
University of Hartford, has been named to the National Soccer Coaches Assn. of 
American All-America first team. Reifer, the North Atlantic Conference player 
of the year, set school records for goals (22) and points (51) in a season in 
leading Hartford to a 16-4-1 record and the NCAA quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>

have been named to the All-State girls' volleyball third team by Cal-Hi Sports. 
</P>
<P>

tournament will be played at 7:30 tonight at Redondo. In the semifinals 
Wednesday, South Torrance met Hawthorne and San Pedro played defending champion 
Redondo. COUNTDOWN 
</P>
<P>
 Only 31 days until the Super Bowl, which means South Bay runners don't have 
much time to prepare for the 17th annual Redondo Beach Super Bowl 10-K run Jan. 
29. The top 10 men's and women's finishers will each receive prize money, with 
the winners getting $1,000 apiece. ROB FERNAS

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: DOWN-HOME SOUTHERN COOKING FROM ROSIE; SOME FOLKS CALL IT 
SOUL FOOD. BUT THE STAPLES AT ROSIE'S KITCHEN ARE BARBECUED RIBS, FRIED 
CATFISH, PEACH COBBLER AND SWEET POTATO PIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some folks refer to Rosie Cooper's Southern cuisine as soul food, but she just 
calls it home cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 The barbecued ribs and fried catfish, peach cobbler and sweet potato pie that 
Cooper serves at her Monrovia restaurant, Rosie's Kitchen (no relation to the 
low-fat guru named Rosie who presides over Oprah's kitchen), are the staples of 
her childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me and so many other people it's not soul food. It's every day food," she 
said. "It's what we were raised on. We were raised on greens and corn bread and 
beans and yams and all the good food!" 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, whose family moved from Mississippi to Pasadena when she was a child, 
used to whip up those dishes for her six brothers and sisters. So after she 
retired from a career as an administrative secretary, the restaurant business 
was a natural transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to do something for myself," she said. "I had wanted to open a 
restaurant for four or five years." 
</P>
<P>
 She worked as a waitress at the previous restaurant on the site, Salt and 
Pepper, and when it closed last summer, she took the plunge and bought it. 
She's decorated the small eatery with burgundy tablecloths and posters of 
figures like jazz great Louis Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wandered about and asked," she said, " 'What do people like that they can't 
find in Monrovia?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fried fish came to mind, and so did open-pit barbecue fare. Rosie and her 
staff cook up heaps of ribs, pork, sliced beef and chicken over an open-pit 
barbecue every other day. And she drives down to Los Angeles' wholesale fish 
market to buy fresh seafood. The menu includes whiting, red snapper, sand dab, 
catfish, filet of sole and shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
 Meals come with one or two side dishes. Diners can choose Southern specials -- 
collard greens, Cajun red beans, rice -- as well as generic favorites such as 
potato salad, french fries or cole slaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The desserts are made here as well: warm peach or apple cobbler or sweet 
potato pie, topped with ice cream, if you like. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mini-dinners," a good choice for lunch, include smaller portions of meat or 
fish and one side dish. Full dinners come with two sides and more of the main 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Catfish is $7.99 for a full dinner, and baby back ribs are the same. A half 
chicken dinner is $5.99, and red snapper is $6.99. Mini-dinners are about $2 
less for most items. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosie's Kitchen, 622 S. Myrtle Ave., Monrovia. Open 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Tuesday 
through Saturday and noon to 6 p.m. Sunday. Prices from $2.99 to $9.99. (818)

LAST KWANZAA EVENT TO BE HELD FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last event of Kwanzaa, the African American holiday celebration that 
starts the day after Christmas and lasts through Jan. 1, will be held Friday 
night at the Perspective on Open Awareness, 2045 N. Fair Oaks Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Kwanzaa events will end with Karamu, a traditional African feast, 
said Amina Thomas, chair of the nine-member Pasadena-Altadena Kwanzaa 
Organizing Committee.The Karamu meal will be from 7 to 9 p.m and is open to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Created in 1966, the annual Kwanzaa celebration encourages Americans of 
African descent to focus on a different principle on each of the holiday's 
seven days. The seven Kwanzaa principles are unity, self-determination, work 
done with the help of neighbors, family and society, purpose, creativity and 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is in its fourth year in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the one time of the year that the whole community can come together 
as one, in spite of whatever differences they may have," Thomas said.

 NOT MUCH LEFT: Because so many moderate Democratic members of the House of 
Representatives were wiped out in the GOP's midterm election deluge last month, 
most political analysts have assumed that the Democratic contingent in the new 
104th Congress would not only be smaller -- by about 50 seats -- but also more 
liberal. Not so, according to figures compiled by Americans for Democratic 
Action, which bills itself as "the nation's premier liberal organization." 
ADA's average rating for Democrats in the 103 Congress, based on votes on 20 
key pieces of legislation, was 75% in the first session and 70% in the second. 
But the average score for the 197 returning members, as compiled by ADA, is 
only 68%. ADA national director Amy Isaacs claims that once voters realize how 
far right the new Congress has moved, they "will be astonished and demand more 
compassionate government."

 KEEPS ON GIVING: At first glance, it may not appear unusual that Sorrell 
Booke, the Encino actor who played Boss Hogg on television's "The Dukes of 
Hazzard," would give a campaign contribution to former Rep. Ben Jones (D-Ga.), 
who used to co-star on the show. Booke's $250 contribution to Jones, who tried 
unsuccessfully to unseat Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), was in the form of a 
Booke-signed check dated Nov. 4. Trouble is, Booke died nine months earlier. 
Jones' campaign officials say there really is no irregularity: The check was 
from Booke's trust, not from Booke himself, and is signed by trustee Frederick 
D. Booke. "Mr. Booke did not come back from the dead," said Bobby Kahn, Jones' 
treasurer. "And unfortunately, enough voters didn't come back from the dead 
either."

 MAYBE, MAYBE NOT: The Rev. Jesse Jackson is opening state chapters of his 
National Rainbow Coalition in Iowa and New Hampshire, states traditionally 
viewed as early testing grounds for White House aspirants, but he's being coy 
about the possibility of making a third bid for the presidency. "It is 
premature to make that decision," said Jackson, announcing the formation of 
chapters in Iowa, New Hampshire, California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan and 
Georgia. Despite his determined ducking and weaving, Jackson fueled the 
speculation game by sounding themes that sounded familiar to anyone who heard 
the "Keep Hope Alive" campaign speeches he gave during his 1984 and 1988 
presidential runs. In any case, he said he is in no hurry to make up his mind, 
even though some presidential hopefuls are already organizing their campaigns. 
"Some people have to run early because they run slow," he said. "Some people 
have long strides and know where they have to go."

 ONE FOR THE ROAD: Sometimes it pays to leave well enough alone. The White 
House Office of National Drug Control Policy wanted to let everyone know that 
it had listed the wrong location in an earlier press release about a scheduled 
briefing. But someone must have spiked the holiday punch, because the headline 
on the corrected announcement -- "Drug Policy Director Salutes National Drunk 
and Drugged Driving Month" -- was missing a critical word that was supposed to 
appear in next-to-last position: Prevention.

SEEKING SANCTUARY; MOTHER, CHURCH AT ODDS OVER EXPULSION OF LEARNING-DISABLED 
BOY FROM CHOIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are few places in the world where 11-year-old Joshua Camberlan fits. Not 
regular school, not other children's slumber parties. 
</P>
<P>
 But his church was another matter. That, his mother believed, would always be 
a refuge for her learning-disabled son. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet after years of strained relations with the Westwood United Methodist 
Church, where she struggled to keep her son in Sunday school classes and the 
children's choirs, Alisa Camberlan recently suffered what she saw as her most 
stinging rebuff from an unaccepting world: Josh was expelled from the youth 
choir after one of the choir directors allegedly said he felt "embarrassed" by 
the boy's often inappropriate outbursts and distracted manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is 1994. This is Westwood, " says Camberlan, 51, a single parent to her 
only son. 
</P>
<P>
 Church staffers feel equally betrayed that Camberlan has chosen to attack 
them. For years, they say, they have coped and sympathized with a child 
hopelessly out of step with the rest of the children in Sunday school and 
choir. What they feel, they say, is frustration, not embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church wants to do the right thing," says senior pastor Sharon 
Rhodes-Wickett. 
</P>
<P>
 But that moral rule of thumb offers no easy guidance here. A congregation of 
sophisticated, well-educated people -- a community filled with resources to 
solve all sorts of technical and social problems -- is struggling to figure out 
just what the right thing is. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Camberlan suffers from a cognitive, language and behavioral disorder 
(and, to a milder extent, a motor-skills disorder). It is the result of a 
trauma that occurred during his mother's labor and delivery, his neurologist, 
Ronald Gabriel, surmises. The boy articulates poorly; he reads like a 
first-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 Blessed with a handsomeness that would let most boys glide into society, he 
trips over his own shortcomings, missing many of the social cues that his peers 
take for granted. Often unfocused and distracted, he will yell out or act 
impulsively. Tranquilizing drugs help him lead a semi-normal life. 
</P>
<P>
 So does his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh's disabilities have never stopped Alisa Camberlan from taking him on 
yearly sojourns to England and shuttling him each day from his special school 
to an after-school program. Like many a doting parent, she has filled his world 
with trips to concerts, operas, and restaurants and stocked his room with books 
and puzzles and computer games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that many people want to deal with a special-needs child," she says. 
"Sometimes I don't want to deal with him." She lives with the heartache of 
knowing he will never change, that he will never become independent: "We can 
fix hearts, we can fix livers, but you can't repair a brain." Yet she is 
fiercely proud of his development. "I take Josh everywhere with me," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once a runway model, Camberlan is now an individual and family counselor. She 
sees clients two days a week and spends the rest of her time with Josh. She 
never married his father, pop singer-songwriter Barry Richards, who takes Josh 
to his own home one weekend a month and takes him to dinner once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Financially comfortable, Camberlan, her son and a wire-haired fox terrier, 
Asta, share a cozy duplex in the flats of Beverly Hills. Photographs of Josh 
line the hallways and sit in frames on tabletops. On the stairway, she pauses 
like any doting mother in front of picture of him at 2 1/2. "Here he is -- 
little lamb chop," she says, stroking a bit of dust from the frame. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing the boy has never lacked is a love of music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Josh always sings when he's in the car with me," says his father. "I make up 
songs when we're going along." 
</P>
<P>
 But when he stood with the church choirs, he would rarely -- if ever -- sing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone else is moving his mouth and singing and he will stand there," says 
the mother, demonstrating a straight-ahead, calm stare. "He will move 
gracefully -- usually gracefully -- to the music." 
</P>
<P>
 His expulsion from the youth choir was just one of the rebuffs that Camberlan 
says pains her. She remembers when Josh wasn't promoted in Sunday school with 
his class. Once this past fall, she visited his Sunday school class and 
glimpsed how the children joined hands in a prayer circle at the end of the 
session -- but they didn't include Josh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not one hand, not one head turned to include him," says Camberlan, her voice 
showing she is still bruised. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, the church either remedied the situation or had an explanation. 
Sometimes, however, problems remained simply because the mother and church 
officials -- all highly verbal people -- could simply not communicate with each 
other about the status of a verbally deficient child. The church's explanations 
sit uneasily with Camberlan, who feels alternately disappointed, infuriated and 
frustrated by staffers' actions since her child was of school age. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet there she sits in the second pew most Sundays. She stays in the 
church, she says, because it is hers: She fell in love with the dark wood and 
expanses of stained glass when she attended a wedding there. Later, when she 
became pregnant, she decided she would raise her child there. Josh was baptized 
there.  
</P>
<P>
 On choir appreciation day this past fall, Josh's name was left off the roster 
of choir members. His mother scrawled an angry note on her Sunday bulletin and 
said she would be forgoing her monthly $75 check to the church because of the 
oversight. Shortly after, church officials decided Josh should not return to 
the youth choir. A week later, his mother was stunned to get the news in a 
phone conversation with David Gray, the church's program director for children 
and youth.  
</P>
<P>
 Camberlan is not insisting her son was a perfect fit. "If the other kids are 
singing and he's standing there, it does look different," she says. But she 
grows irritated at the notion that he can't simply be there, singing or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not national television, it's not a talent show. These are not 
professional musicians. This is a church, " she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you gather the staff from Westwood United Methodist Church, they will tell 
you that they have not forgotten it is a church. If Alisa Camberlan has a 
checklist of slights, they have their own list -- years of dealing with a 
squirmy, distracted child who never kept pace with his peers and classmates, 
years of dealing with a mother who constantly second-guessed them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do recognize it's a difficult thing for us to provide what she needs," 
says Gray. "We are also very concerned to not penalize the other young people . 
. . we've tried very hard to find this middle ground." 
</P>
<P>
 As Josh got older and the other children matured, he lagged further behind. At 
one point, when he was required to follow a hymnal, the choir staff asked 
volunteers to come and turn pages for him. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday school, Josh is allowed to stay in the classroom with his 11- to 
14-year-old peers, says his teacher, Betty Holden, even though he rarely 
participates and often interrupts the discussion.  
</P>
<P>
 Staffers were irritated by the small things they say the mother didn't do: She 
dropped Josh off at choir rehearsal on Sunday mornings but never stayed to talk 
to the teachers or observe the practice. Sometimes before longer rehearsals for 
special choral events, she dropped off his medicine and asked people to give it 
to him. She had to be asked to take a turn bringing snacks to the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel she can be more involved in helping us understand Josh's problems," 
says youth choir director Ruth Drossel. 
</P>
<P>
 As Josh entered the junior high age group this past fall, the gap between him 
and his peers became more glaring. This year, Drossel has big plans for the 
youth choir. There are no auditions for the choir, but most of the dozen or so 
junior and senior high school age members can read music and play musical 
instruments. "It is a professionalism," says Drossel. "We are training these 
kids to be worship leaders. Josh has not proven to us that he can be a leader." 
</P>
<P>
 The beginning of the end of choir for Josh Camberlan came Sept. 25 when he 
showed up to sing with the youth choir.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was looking around and moving around," recalls Richard Rintoul, a 
professional musician and the adult choir director who happened to be directing 
the youth choir that day. Meanwhile, the other children were "trying to hold 
him in place because it seemed like he wanted to walk away -- which then throws 
some of the other ones off. So the end result was not as good as it could have 
been for the whole choir." 
</P>
<P>
 Rintoul and Drossel decided that Josh shouldn't continue in the choir. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I never said I was embarrassed by Josh," says Rintoul. "I'm not 
embarrassed by Josh. . . . He's been to some of my concerts. He always comes up 
afterward. And I've always found him a very sweet kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Youth program director Gray admits that he told Camberlan that Rintoul said he 
was embarrassed by her son.  
</P>
<P>
 "I must have picked up the wrong word then," says Gray, who has since 
apologized to Rintoul. "I thought that was the term that was used." 
</P>
<P>
 But the word embarrassed is etched in Camberlan's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone is embarrassed by my son, screw them," she says. "It's their 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray points out that the church has tried to include Josh in other activities 
-- sometimes to no avail. "I was hoping Josh would be able to be part of the 
Nativity scene on Christmas Eve," says Gray. Josh would play a shepherd. "It's 
a tableau. There are no lines they have to memorize." 
</P>
<P>
 Alisa Camberlan was less than moved. "I said, 'Thank you very much' but I have 
other plans." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The question persists: What is the right thing? 
</P>
<P>
 Since Josh was expelled from choir, the choir directors have offered Alisa 
Camberlan a compromise: "If Alisa were willing to be there with him at the 
rehearsals or have somebody else be there with him, we would reconsider our 
position on having him in the choir," says Rintoul. 
</P>
<P>
 What does Josh think of being left out of the choir? Is he sad? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," he says on a Sunday afternoon in his living room as he fiddles with a 
child's game on the back of a cold-cuts package. His answer is sober but 
emotionless. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a very flat (verbal) affect," says Barbara Cull, head of the special 
Eras School that Josh attends. "If he's told he can't be part of something, 
he'll be sad but he won't know how to show that." 
</P>
<P>
 During the afternoon conversation with Josh, his mother slips out of the room 
so that her son will better focus on his interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does he like the choir? 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it because they sing loud," he says, eyeing his questioner. "Because 
it made me have a headache." 
</P>
<P>
 A headache? That's why he liked it? He gives a similar answer again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what he means," says Cull a day later. "You know how you get chills 
when you enjoy something? It's like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Josh is often acutely aware of the little dramas unfolding around him. As he 
stands with his mother outside his Sunday school classroom after church one 
day, he watches as choir director Rintoul nonchalantly asks Alisa Camberlan if 
they can talk. The two walk down the hall out of earshot. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are they talking about?" Josh asks quietly. "Are they talking about me?" 
</P>
<P>
 As the Camberlans walk out of church one Sunday, Josh is more hyperactive than 
usual, jumping around as his mother tries to calm him down. But suddenly Josh 
passes an open door where another service is going on. People are singing 
energetically and he stops, transfixed, to watch and listen.  
</P>
<P>
 His mother indulges him, then coaxes him out into the air. "Come on, Josh," 
she says leading him out. "We'll put a Brian Ferry tape on in the car."

$71,500 CAMPAIGN SETTLEMENT REVEALED; POLITICS: PAYMENT ARISING FROM 1991 THEFT 
OF CAMPAIGN SIGNS FOR HAL BERNSON'S RIVALS WAS SEALED BY COURT BUT REVEALED IN 
REPORT TO ETHICS COMMISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cheap political tricks have gotten more expensive, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is believed to be the largest settlement of its kind, a Northridge 
businessman, without admitting any wrongdoing, agreed to pay $71,500 to settle 
a lawsuit that accused him of sabotaging the campaigns of two rivals of Los 
Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, according to documents on file with the 
city Ethics Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the settlement, reached last year, were sealed by court order. But 
one of the plaintiffs -- Walter Prince, whose signs were stolen during his 
unsuccessful campaign for Bernson's seat in 1991 -- filed information on the 
case with the Ethics Commission. News of the settlement came to light recently 
as Prince started using his share of the money to mail refunds to those who 
contributed to his ill-fated campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince and Allen Hecht, another unsuccessful candidate in the 1991 race, 
alleged in their lawsuit that tire store owner Alan Fox stole hundreds of 
campaign signs in an attempt to derail their campaigns against Bernson, a 
friend of Fox. The thefts violated their civil rights, the suit charged. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the hefty settlement was a hot topic in the local political 
world, where sign vandalism has long been viewed as a popular outdoor sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as all-American as apple pie," said corporate political consultant Paul 
Clarke, cheerfully recalling sign-vandalizing capers of his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who hasn't heard of the environmental or neighborhood cleanup committee being 
formed to remove an opponent's signs?" said Clarke, a former campaign adviser. 
Clarke said he hoped the Fox case did not set a precedent. "This is 
ridiculous," he said. "I have nothing but contempt for those who get in the 
ring, get hit and then whine. It's real wimpism." Others said they expected the 
settlement would be beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican consultant Natalie Blanning said she would add the Fox case to her 
speech warning youthful campaign volunteers in particular to leave opponents' 
signs alone. "I always tell them about the guy who paid $2,500 in fines and 
spent a night in jail when he was caught," she said. "But $71,500 is really a 
lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Consultant Harvey Englander, who ran Bernson's 1991 campaign, said he hoped 
the case sets an example. "Hopefully it'll put an end to these shenanigans," 
said Englander, who added that he has never been in a campaign in 26 years in 
which there weren't allegations of campaign sign stealing. 
</P>
<P>
 In one prominent example, Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky -- as he 
ran for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors -- was 
photographed earlier this year only moments after he had ripped down a road 
sign advertising the candidacy of his main opponent, Don Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, who filed the settlement documents with the Ethics Commission as part 
of a campaign finance disclosure document, said Wednesday that he hoped the 
resolution of his case would act as a deterrent. "We got cheated out of a 
decent election because of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, contacted at his Sepulveda-based firm Ram Tire, was surprised to learn 
that terms of the settlement were now in the public record and refused to 
comment. In the settlement, Fox denied any culpability. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, owner of a janitorial service, and Hecht, a computer consultant, were 
part of an insurgent movement that tried to oust Bernson from office in 1991, a 
year when the incumbent -- battered by controversy surrounding his use of 
campaign funds and his support for the huge Porter Ranch construction project 
-- was believed to be highly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson narrowly won reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the 1991 primary, a Northridge couple saw two men removing a Prince 
sign from a grocery store parking lot. The couple, thinking there was something 
amiss, noted the license plate of the truck being driven by the men. The truck 
was subsequently found to be registered to Fox's tire company and the couple 
also later identified Fox as one of the men in the truck, according to 
deposition testimony and authorities who investigated the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson has denied that he ordered anyone to tear down signs in the 1991 
campaign. He was not a defendant in the lawsuit, and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince has begun mailing refund checks to about 75 people who contributed 
money to his 1991 campaign, using the settlement proceeds to pay them. 
</P>
<P>
 After the lawyers and the other parties took their shares, Prince's political 
committee netted about $11,000. Prince said he was refunding the money because 
he felt his supporters had been the real victims of the sign-stealing escapade.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ENCINO; EX-BUSINESSMAN 
SENTENCED IN FRANCHISE FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Encino businessman was sentenced Wednesday to 4 1/2 years in federal 
prison for a scheme in which he offered franchises to sell high-quality 
"impulse items" such as hosiery and batteries, but instead provided investors 
with cheap plastic pens to display in tiny, low-volume shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his age, 60-year-old Don David Wilson was ordered to pay only 
$10,000 in restitution, a fraction of the $3.5 million that federal prosecutors 
say was lost by more than 100 victims around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Wilson's victims were elderly people looking for a way to supplement 
their retirement incomes, and they believed the phony financial documents and 
credit references Wilson arranged from his offices in Encino, Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Diane E. Birnholz said. 
</P>
<P>
 His "most egregious misrepresentation," Birnholz said, was persuading his 
victims to phone supposedly thrilled clients who were actually Wilson himself 
or people hired "to sing the praises of his companies," Birnholz said. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for Wilson called the sentence by U.S. District Judge J. Spencer 
Letts "reasonable and fair." Prosecutors had sought six years in prison and 
$75,000 in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has been held at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Downtown 
Los Angeles since April, when a jury found him guilty of eight counts of mail 
fraud and two counts of interstate transportation of money obtained by fraud. 
He was taken into custody immediately after the verdict because authorities 
considered him a flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's crimes occurred between 1982 and 1988, according to Birnholz, when he 
operated Great American Service Merchandising Corp. and P.O.P. American Corp. 
on Ventura Boulevard.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES; 
DISNEY FAMILY CRITICIZES COUNTY STAND ON MUSIC HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials of the troubled Walt Disney Concert Hall project said threats by Los 
Angeles County to declare the Downtown project in default of a county lease 
agreement are premature under the terms their contract with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the county, Disney family attorney Ronald E. Gother said 
project officials "are seriously concerned about the alarmist tone" of the 
county's correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials last week threatened to declare Disney Hall project managers 
in default within days, and to seize a $10-million deposit to finish 
construction of a county-owned parking structure on the site. No such action 
has been taken. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's threats came on the heels of a November announcement that Disney 
Hall officials had halted all construction-related work and had launched a 
study to cut costs. The halt occurred after cost estimates for the hall 
escalated to $260 million -- $50 million above earlier estimates. The project 
was initiated by a 1987 gift of $50 million from the Disney family; Disney 
family contributions have since swelled to $93 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, to be built at 1st Street and Grand Avenue near the Los Angeles 
Music Center, is to become the new home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT LOGS 218 GANG KILLINGS IN 1994 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A record 218 gang killings occurred in 1994 in areas patrolled by the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department, erasing the record of 207 set in 1991, 
Sheriff Sherman Block said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino gang killings were up and constituted about 75% of all such killings, 
Block said. Gang murders among black youths dropped to 50, he said. The sheriff 
added that drive-by shootings have declined in the areas deputies patrol, which 
include the unincorporated county and several municipalities that contract with 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the gang homicides today seem to be more focused," Block said. 
"They're literally walk-up shootings, rather than drive-by shootings."

 Seal Beach is a quiet bedroom community today. But early in the century, the 
city was a lively vacation mecca, home to a giant ocean-side amusement park.

 The park, known as the Joy Zone, was near the city's historic pier. It 
featured a giant roller coaster brought to the city in 1915 from the San 
Francisco Panama-Pacific International Exposition.

 Two scintillator lamps were placed at the end of the pier. At night, they

2 SUSPECTED THIEVES ARRESTED IN MOTEL ROOM PACKED WITH LOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call it case closed for West Hollywood's "Christmas burglars." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies on Wednesday arrested two men at a West 
Hollywood motel room that was stuffed with an estimated $10,000 worth of stolen 
gifts and other merchandise, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't hurt that the suspects left a stolen luxury car parked in front of 
the motel. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't the smartest crooks you'll ever meet," said Deputy David Oliva, 
who, with Deputy Jeff Hoslet, arrested the men at the Alta Cienega Motel in the 
1000 block of La Cienega Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many of the items had name tags, investigators were able to begin 
notifying crime victims almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects, Michael J. Myette, 24, and Roman J. Ferreira, 25, both of West 
Hollywood, were being held at the West Hollywood sheriff's station on suspicion 
of auto theft, burglary, receiving stolen property and narcotics possession, 
Sheriff's Sgt. Mike Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities had reported a rash of thefts in West Hollywood -- many involving 
gifts stolen from the vehicles of unsuspecting holiday shoppers -- during the 
weeks before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Items recovered Wednesday included skis, a bass guitar, a wide array of 
clothing, jewelry, a clarinet, a pellet gun, stereo equipment, expensive liquor 
and candy and an assortment of unopened boxes with the wrapping paper and 
ribbons intact. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies, who were patrolling on bicycles, arrested the men after 
recognizing the car -- a $50,000 Mercedes -- as one reported stolen Tuesday, 
Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 While questioning the men at the door of the motel room, one of the deputies 
noticed a white bass guitar leaning against the wall that resembled one that 
had been reported stolen only hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was only a small room, but it looked like a warehouse in there," Deputy 
Oliva said. "They had stuff stacked everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects, who were arrested without incident, explained that they had 
"found" the car, and that the rest of the items -- many in designer luggage 
that also was stolen -- were personal belongings, the deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the expensive men's suits and leather jackets, however, the deputies 
also discovered a fair share of lingerie and other women's clothing. "One of 
(the suspects) tried to say it was for his mother, but he knew we weren't 
buying it," Oliva said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really amazing how quick" deputies were able to notify crime victims of 
the recovered items, said George Gund, 22, who was reunited with his prized 
guitar within hours of reporting it stolen from the back seat of his 
girlfriend's car, a block from the motel. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my pride and joy," Gund, a college student, said of the instrument. 
"It was like getting an extra Christmas present."

 Barbara was given only a 10% chance of surviving a devastating June car 
accident that killed her sister and two other girls. But she was released from 
the hospital last month, a holiday gift that has given her family a much-needed 
injection of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara can walk the few steps to the mailbox in front of the Santa Clarita 
mobile home that she and her grandmother share, but for longer distances she 
needs a wheelchair. Her injuries also left her with a diminished mental 
capacity -- she is now doing second-grade schoolwork. She has just returned to 
the weekly church group meetings that were a focal point in her life before the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing Barbara in this condition has been hard on her grandmother and 
guardian, Mary McWilliams, especially during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cry about it, you worry about it," McWilliams said. But the joy that she 
derives from Barbara's progress has made it possible for McWilliams to partly 
forget her troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything else," McWilliams said, "is trivial." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the accident, Barbara was a student at Canyon High School in Santa 
Clarita. She was so close to her 15-year-old sister, JoKema, that they shared a 
bedroom even though her grandmother's home had an extra bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The two girls attended weekly youth group gatherings at Canyon Country 
Assembly of God Church. The sisters and three friends were on their way home 
from one of those meetings June 1 when tragedy struck. 
</P>
<P>
 JoKema, who reportedly had taken the keys to her grandmother's 1986 Chrysler 
LeBaron without permission, was weaving the car back and forth on Seco Canyon 
Road in Saugus to amuse passenger Jesika Noell, 3. The car drifted across the 
center divider and slammed head-on into two vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 JoKema, Jesika and one of Barbara's best friends, Gena Watkinson, 15, were 
killed in the crash. Barbara and Alicia Acevedo, 14, were hospitalized in 
critical condition, though Alicia was released several weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara underwent several surgeries, but her face could not be entirely 
reconstructed. Her cheekbones and nose are flattened, and she wears makeup to 
cover the scars on her face. 
</P>
<P>
 Glimpses of the spunky youngster that Barbara was before the accident are now 
starting to resurface. She chatted enthusiastically about the Christmas 
presents that she had made for her family and about her hopes of working with 
children when she grows up -- a goal that she had before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 But good humor sometimes disappears, replaced by sudden anger or confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's aware that she is not like she used to be," McWilliams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it became apparent that Barbara would survive, doctors at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center predicted that she would require 24-hour-a-day, 
lifelong care. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is more functional (than predicted), but she still can't be left alone," 
McWilliams said. 
</P>
<P>
 But church members have faith that Barbara will again surprise her doctors and 
make a full recovery.  
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams isn't quite that optimistic yet, but she allows herself to believe 
that it is possible that Barbara could again be the perky, relatively 
untroubled granddaughter she knew before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle," McWilliams said. "She's already a miracle to have made it 
this far."

BLOCK DEFENDS 2 DEPUTIES IN FATAL SHOOTING; LAW ENFORCEMENT: SHERIFF SAYS 
OFFICERS WERE JUSTIFIED IN FIRING AT CRUTCH-WIELDING MAN WHO YELLED, 'KILL ME 
OR I'LL KILL YOU!' 
</P>

<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block staunchly defended the actions of two 
of his deputies Wednesday in the shooting death of a Montrose man who was 
gunned down after he threatened the deputies with a broken metal crutch. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies Greg J. Gabriel, 38, and Paul P. Dino, 37, shot Aaron Cease to death 
Dec. 18 after he thrust a jagged-edged crutch at them like a bayonet and 
shouted, "Kill me or I'll kill you!" Block told reporters Wednesday at his 
monthly news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Block's detailed defense of the shooting was unusual because it came before a 
department investigation of the incident had been completed. He said he was 
making his comments out of concern for the reputation of the two deputies. He 
defended their decision not to use batons or pepper spray against Cease, saying 
they were already holding their flashlights and guns and that the crutch was 
longer than a baton. 
</P>
<P>
 Block said the deputies fired on the 30-year-old Cease only after he 
repeatedly ignored their orders to drop the crutch and continued to jog toward 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives have criticized the shooting, saying that Cease suffered from major 
depression but had never been violent.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's what I expected from them -- to whitewash it any way they could," 
Cease's mother, Doreen Cease, said of Block's comments. "Aaron is described by 
everybody who knew him as a gentle person. It shouldn't have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Block, however, portrayed Cease as a man with "a record of violence" who was 
arrested in August for "viciously" assaulting his brother and who was committed 
for psychiatric observation last year. He also said Cease had quit taking 
psychoactive drugs that had been prescribed for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Toxicology reports show that Cease's blood-alcohol level was 0.27% at the time 
of the shooting, more than triple the legal limit of 0.08%, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His mother told our investigators that when he drank he became very violent," 
Block said. "Witnesses say that he left his house just about midnight that 
night carrying a liter bottle of wine, which he either dropped or threw down 
into the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff said investigators have so far interviewed 10 independent 
witnesses who have corroborated the deputies' account of the shooting.  
</P>
<P>
 The incident began when deputies received a call that a man was hitting cars 
and chasing pedestrians with some sort of object, Block said. A deputy arrived 
in the 2500 block of Montrose Avenue after midnight and ordered Cease to drop 
the crutch. He refused and began swinging it at the deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the bottom half of the crutch flew off, exposing a jagged edge, 
Block said. A second deputy arrived and Cease began moving toward both of them, 
shouting threats.  
</P>
<P>
 The deputies retreated about 120 feet, continuing to demand that Cease drop 
the crutch, Block said. After Cease failed to comply, each deputy fired two 
rounds and when Cease continued toward them, they fired another two rounds and 
then more shots until he finally dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Block described Gabriel and Dino, both nine-year veterans, as experienced 
deputies who were recently commended for defusing an unrelated situation 
without the use of deadly force. Describing deputies' decisions not to use 
batons or pepper spray, Block said: "They were going backward and somebody is 
jogging toward you. If they had fallen, what they envisioned was this (jagged 
crutch) would have come right into their faces. He got within six to 10 feet of 
them before they fired the first shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Block also stated that Cease was "not using the crutch because he needed it 
for walking." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important to recognize that this individual was not an invalid," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Block's statement was in sharp contrast to reports by relatives that Cease 
used the crutch for a weak ankle he had broken earlier this year.  
</P>
<P>
 The killing of Cease has come under fire from relatives and the man who 
originally called authorities, who say it was unnecessary for officers to 
resort to deadly force to control Cease. The family is threatening to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's office are investigating 
the shooting, which is standard practice in fatal shootings by law enforcement 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The two deputies were reassigned to desk duty for five days after the 
shooting, which is also standard procedure. They have since returned to their 
regular shifts, sheriff's officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not surprised that the sheriff has exonerated the deputies involved in 
this shooting," said David Lynn, a board member of Police Watch, a police 
misconduct and lawyer referral service. "When has there ever been a case that 
he has found that the deputies were not justified in shooting?"

ANN CONWAY: RSVP / ORANGE COUNTY; OSMOND UNDERWHELMED BY THE OVERDONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you catch Marie Osmond darting through the lobby of Le Meriden Hotel in 
Newport Beach, don't look for her in the disco-style rags she helped popularize 
in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, some of those '70s silhouettes are enjoying a renaissance. But no, thank 
you , says Osmond, who is starring in "The Sound of Music" at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa through Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the 35-year-old mother of four prefers lines that are 
sophisticated, "like those of a Giorgio Armani or Donna Karan suit," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Osmond to name the most embarrassing thing she wore during those disco 
days and she begins to laugh. "I think the whole '70s was embarrassing. I look 
at the clothes we wore and think, 'You're kidding!' And we really thought we 
were cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1976, when her and brother Donny's faces were smiling from their 
weekly television show, "Donny and Marie," Osmond traveled the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to England and bought my first pair of platforms, then wore them back 
here. People looked at me like I was kidding. I tried to wear a lot of things 
before they actually became popular. If something is in now, it's out for me. 
That's the way I am. I try to stay ahead of the game," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Osmond often wears black on the road. "That can be unfortunate," she says. 
"But black is great when you travel so much. It goes with everything." 
</P>
<P>
 When you see her at the Country Music Awards or as a host on the Children's 
Miracle Network, which she founded, she may be in something colorful, but it 
will be "clean and simple." Overdone is not in her fashion vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a time when she opted for oomph. "When Donny and I did those 
shows, I had the best designers and makeup people available," she says. "It's 
funny to look back now and think, ' my gosh .' 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm not half as embarrassed as Donny should be about what he wore." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is a good chance that "The Sound of Music" will hit Broadway, sources 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably not with me," Osmond confides. "I'm not sure that Broadway would 
like 'The Sound of Music' (again). It doesn't have the pizazz of a 'Phantom' -- 
no dry ice or people coming up through the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Osmond is grateful to be touring with the show, her debut in 
musical theater. "It's a completely different exercise for me," she says. "I 
grew up with TV. And I love country. So this is a wonderful way to challenge 
myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I've fallen in love with Maria Von Trapp. When I was approached to do 
this, I felt people might think, 'Oh, Marie Osmond in "The Sound of Music." 
Cute .' The challenge for me is to have her not so cute. She was a wonderful 
woman who helped heal a dysfunctional family." 
</P>
<P>
 During her stay in Orange County, Osmond will ignore the malls and take her 
children to the Magic Kingdom. "Disneyland, definitely," she says. A trip to 
the theme park will provide a nice break for Stephen, 11, Jessica, 7, Rachael, 
5, and Michael, 3, who are being tutored backstage during Osmond's engagement 
at Segerstrom Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A celebration in a million: On Saturday, the Sound of Music chapter of the 
Guilds of the Orange County Performing Arts Center will toss its first New 
Year's Eve bash. Gutsy move. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, philanthropies such as the Pacific Symphony have attempted to 
rake in cash at a year-end celebration with so-so results. 
</P>
<P>
 But reservations have been pouring in for the $150-per-person, black-tie gala 
at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach, where 200 guests will feast at 
gourmet food stations, get their palms read, sip vintage wines and "gamble" to 
earn tickets for auction bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Why take a chance on New Year's Eve? "Last year we reached our $1-million mark 
in terms of funds we have contributed to the center," says Shari Brown, chapter 
publicist. "We've had a party in March for so long, we felt we needed to do 
something different and special coming off the 1 million goal." Carole Lobdell 
is gala chairwoman. For information, call (714) 720-8772.

CLOSET RX: LEATHER JACKET WORKS FOR REBELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once a rebel, always a rebel. The leather jacket has come a long way, from 
being an outlaw's uniform to part of a Ralph Lauren ensemble. But with its 
earthy smell, there's still a sense that the guy wearing it is trying to go 
against the grain just a little. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that temperatures are low, guys are often tempted to abandon their blazers 
and sport coats and show up for work with a hip leather jacket over a dress 
shirt, tie and slacks. It's a way of hiding conformity under a cloak of rebel 
garb. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it OK? 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on your office culture," says John Shaw of Alex Sebastian for Men 
in Costa Mesa. "In some places, walking in with a leather jacket is absolutely 
fine. In others, where even most sport coats are considered too casual, you'd 
be breaking new ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Downing of Laura Downing in Laguna Beach says: "It's more acceptable now 
than it was a few years ago. With the widespread popularity of Friday 'dress 
down' days, it's more acceptable now to mix casual and dress clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 As a rule, don't expect your jacket to be welcome at a formal business meeting 
or job interview. "It's a mix of formal and casual, which may be something you 
don't want to project to a client or employer," says clothing consultant Brian 
Mayne of Mission Viejo. "If you're wearing your leather jacket to work, make 
sure you hang it up as soon as you get to your desk." 
</P>
<P>
 One style of jacket that seems to cross the line of formality is the leather 
blazer. Although not technically business wear, it does look a little dressier 
than your typical bomber-style leather jacket. "People who like the look and 
feel of a leather jacket but don't want to look too casual often try these," 
Shaw says. "They're distinctive without making you look like too much of a 
rebel." 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue that surrounds leather jackets is how much "babying" they get. 
If you're the kind of person seen in restaurants folding your precious leather 
inside out before putting it on your chair, or anxiously listening for weather 
reports to see if a sprinkle will keep your jacket closeted, you may be an 
overprotective owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Treat your jacket well, but it doesn't have to be pampered," Mayne says. "The 
best leather jackets can stand a little rain, or a few scratches here and 
there. You've got to accept that it's going to get a little worn; you can't 
keep it like new forever."

THE YEAR IN REVIEW: REVISITING THE NOTABLE VALLEY EVENTS OF 1994.; A NAME FOR 
ITSELF; EFFORTS TO GIVE LAKE LOS ANGELES A NEW MONIKER DRY UP -- FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During 1994, this dusty desert town that has no lake and is nowhere near Los 
Angeles was supposed to get a new name. This community, some local leaders 
vowed, would become Desert Buttes, a more appropriate name that would improve 
the town's image and earn it some long overdue respect. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the year drew to a close, Lake Los Angeles was still Lake Los Angeles, 
to everyone except some misinformed map makers at the Automobile Club of 
Southern California. On the club's current Antelope Valley street map, this 
scattered, unincorporated community of 3,500 homes, about 20 miles east of 
Palmdale, is indeed dubbed Desert Buttes. 
</P>
<P>
 Town leaders say the AAA jumped the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Desert Buttes did receive the most votes -- 194 -- in an unofficial November, 
1993, election that asked whether the town's name should be changed and if so, 
to what. But in early 1994, some die-hard Lake Los Angelenos challenged the 
validity of that election, sparking a community clash that has left the new 
name in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's dead," said Bonnie LeFebvre, a vocal name-change opponent, in a 
year-end interview. "Most people would just as soon leave it Lake Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 LeFebvre, co-owner of a local real estate office and a video store, was not 
happy about the costly prospect of changing all her signs, stationery, rubber 
stamps and video identification stickers. 
</P>
<P>
 She and other critics charged that the Lake Los Angeles Rural Town Council 
bungled the election. Opponents claimed the council did not count all the 
ballots that were turned in and mailed others so late that they did not reach 
residents until after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Town Council members defended the election, saying they had mailed ballots to 
all 4,518 registered voters in the area. Of the 757 that were turned in, 55.9% 
favored a name change of some sort. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the names suggested, Desert Buttes was the top vote-getter, followed by 
Desert Springs and Saddleback, a reference to a nearby rock formation. A few 
residents saw the vote in a more whimsical light and wrote in suggestions such 
as Blowing Sands, Outcast Flats, Fools Paradise and Barking Dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of Desert Buttes wanted the Board of Supervisors to make the name change 
official. But opponents insisted the election results could not be taken 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 LeFebvre said local radio personalities made fun of the winning name by 
shortening it to Desert "Butts" and referring to its residents as "butt-heads." 
She also said the election turnout was too small to justify a new name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll bet you that everybody who didn't come out to vote didn't want it 
changed," LeFebvre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the uproar, the Rural Town Council, which makes recommendations to 
county Supervisor Mike Antonovich, put the name change on hold and vowed to 
conduct a new election in November, 1994, when residents would also pick four 
Town Council members. 
</P>
<P>
 But the second name-change vote was never held. 
</P>
<P>
 The Town Council said it didn't have enough money to mail sample ballots to 
all 4,500 registered voters. And local leaders rightly predicted that the Town 
Council race itself would not bring enough people to the polling places. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were only four people running for four seats," said Bob Keys, president 
of the unpaid, seven-member panel. "The turnout was extremely low -- under 100 
voters." 
</P>
<P>
 With the election over, Keys said the Town Council has decided not to 
spearhead a new campaign to change the name of Lake Los Angeles because the 
issue is just too divisive. "If 60% want the name change, there would still be 
40% who don't and who would be quite unhappy about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Keys said, the Town Council will spend its time and energy on more 
pressing matters, such as curbing graffiti, luring a supermarket to town and 
drafting new planning rules to preserve the community's rural character. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Barbara Crane, a past president of the Lake Los Angeles Chamber of 
Commerce who strongly supported a switch to Desert Buttes, said it's unlikely 
to happen any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far as I'm concerned, it's not dead; it's on vacation. It's taking a 
hiatus," she said. "I still want to change the name and improve (the 
community's) image, but it's split the town, and I'm in favor of unity." 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Larry Shaw, Antelope Valley district manager for the Auto Club, 
out on a limb. His maps still show the community as Desert Buttes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had nothing to do with it," he insisted recently. "Somehow, the word got to 
our cartography department, and they changed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, only one caller over the past year has brought the error to his 
attention. "We hand out a lot of maps," he said. "It's funny that almost no one 
has mentioned it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Shaw has sent a special memo to the Auto Club's main office 
concerning those maps that label Lake Los Angeles as Desert Buttes. "Before 
they reprint it," he said, "they'll check with me."

MAN ON PROBATION ARRESTED IN SHOOTING DEATH OF WIFE; CRIME: SUSPECT HAD BEEN 
ARRESTED FOR BATTERY IN 1993 DOMESTIC DISPUTE WITH 40-YEAR-OLD VICTIM, 
AUTHORITIES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man on probation for beating his wife shot her fatally after a domestic 
dispute, authorities alleged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Andrade, 57, of Pacoima, was being held on suspicion of murdering his 
wife, Maria, after he was questioned, Lt. Joseph Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not yet established a motive for the slaying, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade was spotted running from the death scene and was arrested about three 
blocks away, Garcia said. The couple lived in the 10900 block of Herrick 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-year-old victim was shot twice in the upper torso, Garcia said. The 
suspect apparently fired several shots at his wife from arm's length, Garcia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police seized a weapon they believe was used in the killing, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said Andrade had been arrested for battery in a dispute with his wife 
in 1993. The man was still on probation from that incident, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He served some days in jail," Garcia said. "I don't know how long." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple has four children, the oldest of whom is about 19 years old, police 
said.

BLOCK DEFENDS DEPUTIES IN DEATH OF MAN WITH CRUTCH; MONTROSE: MOTHER OF 
30-YEAR-OLD SAYS 'WHITEWASH' DOES NOT SURPRISE HER. SHE SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH HE 
SUFFERED FROM DEPRESSION, HE WAS NEVER VIOLENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block on Wednesday staunchly defended the 
actions of two of his deputies over the shooting death of a Montrose man who 
was gunned down after he threatened the deputies with a broken metal crutch. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies Greg J. Gabriel, 38, and Paul P. Dino, 37, shot and killed Aaron 
Cease on Dec. 18, after he thrust a jagged-edged crutch at the deputies like a 
bayonet and shouted "Kill me or I'll kill you," Block told reporters at his 
monthly news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies fired on the 30-year-old Cease only after he repeatedly ignored 
their orders to drop the crutch and continued to jog toward them, said Block, 
who made his comments before a Sheriff's Department investigation into the 
incident was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question in my mind as to the justified nature of this particular 
shooting," Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members have criticized the shooting, saying that Cease suffered from 
"major depression," but had never been violent.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's what I expected from them -- to whitewash it any way they could," said 
Cease's mother, Doreen Cease, of Block's comments. "Aaron is described by 
everybody who knew him as a gentle person. It shouldn't have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her son, who was under a doctor's care for depression, needed the 
crutch because he had a weak ankle. The family has threatened to take legal 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Block portrayed Cease as a man with "a record of violence" who 
was arrested in August for "viciously" assaulting his brother and who was 
committed the previous year for psychiatric observation. He also said that 
Cease had quit taking psychotherapeutic drugs that had been prescribed for him 
by a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Toxicology reports show that Cease's blood alcohol level was .27% at the time 
of the shooting, more than triple the legal driving limit of .08%, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His mother told our investigators that when he drank he became very violent," 
Block said. "Witnesses say that he left his house just about midnight that 
night carrying a liter bottle of wine, which he either dropped or threw down 
into the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began when deputies at the Crescenta Valley station received a 
call that a man was hitting cars and chasing down pedestrians with an unknown 
object, Block said. A deputy arrived at the 2500 block of Montrose Avenue after 
midnight and ordered Cease to drop the crutch. He refused, and began to swing 
it at the deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the bottom half of the crutch flew off, exposing a jagged edge, 
Block said. A second deputy arrived and Cease began moving toward both deputies 
and shouting threats at them. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies retreated about 120 feet, all the while demanding that Cease drop 
the crutch, Block said. After Cease failed to follow orders, each deputy fired 
a burst of two rounds, and when Cease continued toward them they fired another 
two rounds and then fired more shots until he finally dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Block said so far sheriff's investigators have interviewed 10 independent 
witnesses who have corroborated the deputies' account of the shooting. He said 
he decided to take the highly unusual step and publicly discuss the case out of 
concern for the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the emotional well-being of the deputies demands that we do this," 
Block said. "They have been vilified in some media reports, literally pointed 
out as having no concern for human life, and nothing could be further from the 
truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Block described Gabriel and Dino, both nine-year veterans, as experienced 
deputies who were recently commended for diffusing an unrelated situation 
without the use of deadly force. He also defended the deputies' decisions not 
to use batons or pepper spray, noting that the deputies' hands were occupied by 
their flashlights and guns and that the crutch was longer than a baton. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were going backwards and somebody is jogging toward you; if they had 
fallen, what they envisioned was, this (jagged crutch) would have come right 
into their faces," Block said. "He got within six to 10 feet of them before 
they fired the first shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Block also said that Cease was "not using the crutch because he needed it for 
walking." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important to recognize that this individual was not an invalid," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Block's statement was in sharp contrast to reports by family members that 
Cease used the crutch for a weak ankle he had broken earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing of Cease has come under fire by family members and by the man who 
called deputies to the scene, all of whom have said it was unnecessary for 
officers to resort to deadly force to control Cease. 
</P>
<P>
 Cease's mother, Doreen, confirmed this week that her family has retained a 
Woodland Hills attorney to represent the family in possible legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members speculated that Cease was on his way to the 7-Eleven a few 
blocks from his home when he was shot. Three or four times each week, Cease 
would go to the store at the corner of Montrose and La Crescenta avenues in 
Glendale to buy cigarettes, coffee or wine, but only if his mother had phoned 
store employees and given permission to charge the items on her credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's office are 
investigating the shooting, which is standard practice in fatal shootings that 
involve law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies were reassigned to desk duty for five days after the shooting, 
which is also standard procedure. They have since returned to their regular 
shifts, sheriff's officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not surprised that the sheriff has exonerated the deputies involved in 
this shooting," said David Lynn, a board member for Police Watch, a Los 
Angeles-based police misconduct and lawyer referral service. "When has there 
ever been a case that he has found that the deputies were not justified in 
shooting?" 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union also expressed concern about the incident, 
and a spokesman said the organization would monitor the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn said that in the wake of Cease's death, his organization is again calling 
for the Sheriff's Department to establish a citizen review board "with teeth" 
to investigate alleged cases of officer misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is just another example of how police cannot police themselves," 
Lynn said.

BUSINESSMAN SENTENCED TO PRISON IN FRANCHISE SCAM; COURT: IN ADDITION TO 4 
1/2-YEAR TERM, DON DAVID WILSON IS TOLD TO PAY $10,000 IN RESTITUTION, A 
FRACTION OF THE $3.5 MILLION HE WAS ACCUSED OF TAKING FROM HIS VICTIMS. 
</P>

<P>
 A former San Fernando Valley businessman was sentenced Wednesday to 4 1/2 
years in federal prison for a scheme in which he offered franchises to sell 
high-quality "impulse items" such as hosiery and batteries, but instead 
provided investors with cheap plastic pens to display in tiny, low-volume 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his age, 60-year-old Don David Wilson was also ordered to pay only 
$10,000 in restitution, a fraction of the $3.5 million that federal prosecutors 
say he cheated out of more than 100 victims around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Wilson's victims were elderly people looking for a way to supplement 
their retirement incomes, and they believed the phony financial documents and 
credit references Wilson arranged from his offices in Encino, Assistant U. S. 
Atty. Diane E. Birnholz said. 
</P>
<P>
 His "most egregious misrepresentation," Birnholz said Wednesday, was 
persuading his victims to phone supposedly thrilled clients who were actually 
Wilson himself or hired "singers." 
</P>
<P>
 "They were paid to sing the praises of his companies," Birnholz said. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for Wilson called the sentence by U. S. District Judge J. Spencer 
Letts "reasonable and fair" since prosecutors had sought six years in prison 
and $75,000 in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that Don has expressed his remorse for what he did," federal Public 
Defender Guy Iversen said. "He has admitted perpetuating this scenario; he's 
sorry for it and feels the sentenced imposed is fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has been held at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Downtown 
Los Angeles since April, when a jury found him guilty of eight counts of mail 
fraud and two counts of interstate transportation of money obtained by fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taken into custody immediately after the verdict because authorities 
considered him a flight risk. A former Sherman Oaks resident, Wilson was 
indicted in December, 1992, and became a fugitive until Jan. 22, 1993, when he 
was stopped for speeding in Lubbock, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 His crimes of fraud occurred between 1982 and 1988, according to Birnholz, 
when he operated Great American Service Merchandising Corp. and P.O.P. American 
Corp. on Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he would advertise his services as a franchise consultant on respected, 
news-oriented radio stations around the country, providing listeners with a 
toll-free number to call. Then Wilson would travel coast-to-coast with slick 
brochures, meeting potential investors in person. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who fell for the scheme paid initial franchise fees of $28,480 in the 
belief that they would be selling desirable products in busy stores chosen by 
marketing experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Wilson's investors received plastic buckets of pens and pencils, 
self-help tapes and solar barbecues, and their assigned network of retailers 
included dingy shops with few customers, authorities contended. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was convicted once before of a similar scheme in Santa Clara County, 
Birnholz said. After the 1970 verdict, he served nearly two years in state 
prison on charges of conspiracy, forgery and grand theft, she said.

MAN FACES SECOND MURDER CHARGE; HOMICIDE: AUTHORITIES LINK EX-SONGWRITER TO 
SHOOTING DEATH OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE BODY WAS FOUND NEAR CASTAIC.

 A former Motown songwriter already facing one count of murder for the slaying 
of a Woodland Hills man will also be charged with the shooting death of a 
25-year-old Chicago woman whose body was found last June outside Castaic, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles district attorney's office plans to amend the original murder 
charge today to add a second murder charge stemming from the death of Digna 
Adames, 25, whose body was found outside Castaic on June 14, Sandi Gibbons, a 
district attorney's office spokeswoman said late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Adames was an aspiring musician and a member of a female trio in Chicago. Her 
partners refused, but she accepted Goga's offer to come to Los Angeles with him 
where he promised to hook her up with the right people in the music industry, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adames left a 7-year-old son behind in Chicago and called back home almost 
every day until June 10, her father's birthday, when the calls from her 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that Goga became infatuated with Adames, and referred to her as 
his girlfriend to other people. Adames, according to friends and relatives, 
tried to maintain a business relationship with Goga, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goga, 50, was originally charged with the murder of Charles (Chick) Evans, 60, 
a retired movie technician who took in the songwriter. Evans' body was found in 
his Del Valle Avenue home by a suspicious neighbor on Dec. 7, and police 
believe that Evans was killed after he ordered Goga to leave his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Goga was picked up by police officers in Huntington Woods, Mich., on Dec. 10 
when Mary Danescu, his half-sister, called police to report a prowler in her 
back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a lot we can say about this case until he comes back and there is 
a preliminary hearing," Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to family members, Goga's life began to come apart about two years 
ago, after he divorced his wife of six years. After that, Goga moved around a 
lot, often staying with friends for short periods of time. Danescu said for a 
brief period Goga lived in his car after the divorce.

MAN ARRESTED IN ARIZONA FACES BIGAMY CHARGES; MATRIMONY: POLICE SAY THE 
EX-MODEL WAS MARRIED TO FOUR WOMEN, INCLUDING ONE IN PALMDALE.

 Charmaine Whalen is nobody's fool. 
</P>
<P>
 When her husband, Vernon Pierce, failed to fly out and meet her family after 
the couple's April 29 wedding, Whalen decided it was time to do a little poking 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Pierce, 33, is facing bigamy charges and Whalen, 24, is considering a job 
change: from bank teller to police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream was to go into the LAPD, and I put my dreams on hold for him," 
Whalen said. "Now I really want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, an ex-model, turned himself in Tuesday to authorities in Glendale, 
Ariz. He was charged there with two counts of bigamy. Authorities said he was 
married to four women -- two in California and two in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 He had eluded investigators since June 6, when Whalen asked police to go to 
his Arizona home. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of finding Pierce, detectives found another wife. 
</P>
<P>
 After the two women compared notes, police found records of at least four 
marriages, one in 1989 and three this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there was a lot of lying going on. I did the best I could, but I 
still made mistakes," Pierce told the Arizona Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, who was free on $1,500 bail Wednesday on bigamy charges, said he was 
dating other women, keeping track of some of them on a 3-by-5-inch card labeled 
"Who to Marry." He also carried a little black book in his wallet to keep his 
stories straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lois James, 64, Whalen's grandmother: "He was one smooth talker." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce said he told his wives that his job required him to travel. The truth, 
he said, was altogether different. "I didn't have a job. I didn't have time," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce said it was difficult to juggle the four relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say guys fantasize about something like this, and I guess I did," he 
said. "But you don't have your own life." 
</P>
<P>
 Now police say Pierce is awaiting trial at the home of his latest wife, 
Lemitri (Mimi) Reed of Culver City, whom he married June 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's standing by her man," Whalen said of Reed. "Well, she can have her 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Whalen feels fortunate not to have had any children with Pierce. 
After getting an annulment, she hopes to marry again. 
</P>
<P>
 With one difference, she said: "There will be a strict background 
investigation."

SUSPECT IN 1992 VAN NUYS SLAYING IS ARRESTED IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexican authorities on Wednesday arrested a suspect in the October, 1992, 
shooting death of a Coca-Cola salesman who was killed while speaking to his 
fiancee on the telephone, a Los Angeles police detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials arrested Ramon Reyes at a meat packing plant owned 
by his family in Durango, Mexico, early Wednesday, said Detective Stephen Fisk 
of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had information that the man was in Mexico so we took our case to the 
Mexican authorities and after they reviewed it for more than a year they issued 
a warrant for his arrest," Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes was one of three Pacoima men sought in connection with the slaying of 
Robert Ward, a Coca-Cola salesman from Palmdale who was shot in the back of the 
head during a robbery at a Ralphs supermarket on Sherman Way in Van Nuys, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Santillan, who turned himself in, was sentenced to 26 years to life in 
prison for his role in the slaying. Authorities said they believed Santillan 
drove the getaway car in a robbery spree that carried the men to supermarkets 
in Sherman Oaks, Sunland and Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 A third suspect, Louie Velarde, who was 20 at the time of the shooting, is 
still at large, Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the next one we are going to capture," Fisk said. "It's just a matter 
of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward's death sparked a call for increased security at supermarkets around the 
state, including electronic security equipment such as silent alarms, video 
cameras and other countermeasures to increase employee safety.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MANHATTAN BEACH; SLAIN 
OFFICER MOURNED IN CANDLELIGHT VIGIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A stream of flickering candle lights and words of remembrance marked the 
one-year anniversary of the slaying of Manhattan Beach Police Officer Martin 
Ganz, who was shot during a traffic stop outside a local bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of residents, police officers, friends and family members of Ganz held 
candles as they walked Tuesday evening through city streets to the spot where 
Ganz was shot.There, officers remembered Ganz and mourned the slain officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think about it every day and we will for the rest of our lives," Manhattan 
Beach Officer John Loy said. "It's never going to end." 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz was a popular member of the force. The 29-year-old was about to be 
married when he was shot during a routine traffic stop as his 13-year-old 
nephew looked on. Months went by as authorities searched for Ganz's killer 
before a suspect was named in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Hoan Brady, jailed in Oregon in the slaying of a 55-year-old woman 
during a grocery store robbery, is also suspected of shooting Ganz. Brady faces 
murder charges in Ganz's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the candlelight vigil, the candle bearers were asked to

THE YEAR IN REVIEW: O.C. ROCK BROKE OUT FROM BEHIND THE ORANGE CURTAIN; PUNKS 
HIT PAY DIRT; OLDTIMERS CLEANED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 1994 was the year when young music fans lifted scruffy punk rockers out of the 
underground and into the rock 'n' roll winner's circle, while glitzy icons of 
an earlier rock era milked the punk-loving kids' boomer parents for 
unprecedented amounts of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County music enthusiasts had ringside seats for both developments. 
</P>
<P>
 A ringside seat -- or any good seat, for that matter -- became awfully 
expensive as a parade of marquee names trouped to O.C. commanding ticket prices 
more than triple what the ceiling had been just five years before, back when 
the local economy was actually good. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles, Rod Stewart, Janet Jackson and Bette Midler broke the previously 
unapproached $100 barrier for prime seats. Barbra Streisand eclipsed them all, 
charging $350 and $125 for her stand at The Pond of Anaheim. She did leave a 
few nosebleed seats at the bargain price of $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring two top-scale tickets to Babs, Janet, Bette, Rod and the Eagles would 
have cost $1,535 -- plus Ticketmaster fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The justification for such high prices was that the performances, in some 
cases, were a rarity (Streisand, Eagles) and that superstar attractions were 
simply claiming for themselves part of the windfall that had long been going to 
scalpers, who charge what the market will bear. But the $100 orchestra ticket 
and the $50 or $75 upper-tier seat meant that a concert was now a luxury beyond 
the reach of, or at least an arrogant claim upon, people with modest 
entertainment budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 A record-setting buyers' frenzy was touched off when tickets for Streisand's 
first tour in almost 30 years went on sale in March. Many purchasers bought 
extra tickets for her six shows at The Pond, thinking they could be scalped 
later for a sweet return. But as Streisand's spring arrival neared, the market 
proved lukewarm, and newspaper classified sections were well-stocked with ads 
for tickets being hawked at face value. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was an omen. By year's end, the hazards of financial speculation 
would become all too clear to Orange Countians. If you looked at the county's 
fiscal woes from a pop music perspective, some rich, but sour, ironies began to 
unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 The unruly Orange County punk movement had always taken a skeptical, if not 
downright hostile, stance toward the county's prevailing values of 
acquisitiveness and status-conscious suburban living. In turn, municipalities 
obsessed with the suburban ideal of peace and quiet had sometimes gone out of 
their way to stifle venues catering to punk and alternative music. It was 
almost poetic justice that punk's fortunes and status should zoom during the 
same year that official Orange County watched its credit and credibility sink. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineering the punk breakthrough were the Offspring, a band that came out of 
nowhere if you were looking at the charts, but out of a definite somewhere if 
you had watched the band's early development and listened to its music for key 
influences.  
</P>
<P>
 That somewhere was unquestionably Orange County. Hailing from Cypress and 
Garden Grove, the four band members had taken much of their initial inspiration 
from an early '80s O.C. punk scene that placed great value on melody as well as 
typical punk aggression.  
</P>
<P>
 With their third album, "Smash," the Offspring came up with a full CD's worth 
of memorable hooks and exciting, varied arrangements, never sacrificing a tough 
attack or a sardonic, aggressively questioning attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1993, the Offspring, never a big deal on the local scene, had 
played what was then their biggest headlining show ever in Orange County, to 
150 fans at the now-defunct 8 1/2 Club in Fullerton. By June, with their song 
"Come Out and Play" a hit on alternative rock radio and MTV, they were leaping 
their way through a short but triumphant set for 15,000 enthusiastic fans 
during the daylong KROQ "Weenie Roast" benefit at Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 As the year went on, singer-songwriter Bryan (Dexter) Holland's flying blond 
braids became one of the most common sights an MTV viewer could behold. The 
year ended with "Smash" sales topping 3 million in the United States, 4 million 
worldwide, and with the Offspring still ensconced in the Top 10 on the 
Billboard magazine albums chart. The record's peak chart position, No. 4, tied 
it with the previous high for an O.C. pop album, the Righteous Brothers' 1965 
collection, "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, the Offspring recorded for a small independent company, the Los 
Angeles punk rock label, Epitaph. Sales of "Smash" were unprecedented for a 
punk band on an independent label and were exceeded in punk rock history only 
by "Dookie," the major label release by fellow 1994 punk debutantes Green Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Offspring's members didn't forget their origins, giving credit in 
interviews and on stage to such Orange County punk predecessors as T.S.O.L., 
the Vandals, Agent Orange and the Adolescents. Another local punk band, 
Guttermouth, got a boost when the Offspring brought it on tour as an opening 
act, then released Guttermouth's CD on Nitro Records, a new label started by 
Holland and Offspring bassist Greg Kriesel. In July, T.S.O.L. alumni Jack 
Grisham and Ron Emory returned to the stage after a long layoff in a guest 
appearance with the Offspring at the Hollywood Palladium. They soon landed a 
deal with Epitaph for their new band, Joykiller. The Vandals also became a hot 
property, courted by big labels that previously would have sniffed at them. 
</P>
<P>
 Others not directly touched by the Offspring had their hopes raised by the 
realization that, if still far from the mythical "next Seattle" (i.e. a feeding 
trough for major label scouts brandishing fat contracts), Orange County was at 
last considered a pretty cool address for a band to have. The "Orange Curtain" 
had finally begun to part, and the outside world (starting with music moguls 
just up the freeway) was becoming more aware of a 15-year local legacy of 
strong punk and alternative music that had been hidden behind its home county's 
stereotype as a monolithic, white-bread bastion of comfortable conformity. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than maximize profits, young bands such as the Offspring and Stone 
Temple Pilots (the latter of whom had downplayed their Huntington Beach 
connections when they emerged in 1992, prior to the crack in the curtain) 
adhered to the punk-alternative ethic of keeping concert prices reasonable for 
fans, who often were struggling with rent, tuition and car payments, or working 
after-school jobs at the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Both played Orange County shows for less than $20 a ticket when they could 
easily have charged at least $5 or $10 more. Country stars such as George 
Strait also tended to honor their music's working-class traditions and not soak 
the paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Such moderation, however, was not a consideration for most acts playing the 
county's two big venues -- The Pond and Irvine Meadows. But pricey attractions 
such as Streisand and Stewart at The Pond and the Eagles, Steely Dan and Janet 
Jackson at Irvine were not lacking for takers, and big-venue pop rebounded 
somewhat in '94 after a dismal 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In '93, four big venues -- Irvine Meadows, the Pacific Amphitheatre, Anaheim 
Stadium and the newly opened Pond -- had staged a total of just 48 musical 
events, including the Pacific Symphony's summer season at Irvine. In '94, the 
Pacific was out of commission as its new owner, the Orange County Fair, sought 
a new concert promoter. Anaheim Stadium was leapfrogged by the year's big 
stadium attractions, the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd. But Irvine Meadows and 
The Pond staged a total of 58 shows -- 20 at the Pond and 38 at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Scher, executive vice president of Nederlander Concerts, The Pond's 
exclusive promoter, said attendance at the arena's shows totaled 241,000, or 
just more than 12,000 per concert. He said that 15 of the 20 dates were 
sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled with the results for a first year," said Scher, whose company 
began booking The Pond at the start of 1994. In 5 1/2 months of operation in 
1993, the arena had attracted only six pop concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand's six-show stand was The Pond schedule's centerpiece and represented 
30% of the total concert nights booked. But Scher pointed to a diverse roster 
of acts that included hard rock (Rush), pop-jazz (Kenny G), hip-hop (the 
"Budweiser Superfest" with R. Kelly and Warren G), country (including Strait 
and Alan Jackson) and Latino pop (Juan Gabriel). Stewart, with two shows, was 
the only performer besides Streisand to play multiple dates. 
</P>
<P>
 At Irvine Meadows, 38 dates drew about 370,000 people, for an average of just 
under 10,000 per show, according to Bob Geddes, the amphitheater's managing 
partner. The Eagles led the way with a five-night stand that launched their 
comeback tour; Steely Dan and Jimmy Buffett each played two nights. Geddes said 
The Pond proved as formidable a bidding force in battles to woo talent as 
Irvine Meadows' out-of-commission traditional rival, the Pacific Amphitheatre, 
had been. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did bid some fairly extraordinary dollars for some of the acts they 
got," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Irvine had the great outdoors to itself in Orange County for the 
first time since the Pacific opened in 1983, Geddes said the Glen Helen 
Blockbuster Pavilion in neighboring San Bernardino County intruded on what 
might otherwise have been a complete bonanza. The Pavilion, which opened in 
1993, had a 21-show season; if it hadn't been a factor, Geddes said, Irvine 
Meadows could have landed as many as 10 additional dates. 
</P>
<P>
 At year's end, word was circulating in the music industry that Geddes and 
another Irvine Meadows partner, record magnate Irving Azoff, were trying to 
negotiate a merger between Irvine Meadows and the Blockbuster Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Geddes wouldn't confirm that, but he did say that Avalon Attractions, which 
promotes shows at Irvine Meadows, was involved in year-end negotiations that 
could lead to the reopening of the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim. The 2,800-seat 
theater-in-the-round was dark for virtually the entire year as its longtime 
operator, Edward Haddad, saw his company fall into bankruptcy and lose its 
lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Amphitheatre appeared certain to reopen in 1995 under new 
management, as the Orange County Fair hired the Philadelphia-based Spectacor 
Management Group to run the Costa Mesa facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the club level, the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano rolled along with 
its varied run of touring acts, averaging about 18 shows a month as it 
completed its ninth year of dominance in the O.C. market. In December, owner 
Gary Folgner opened a second Orange County club, the spacious, well-appointed 
Galaxy Concert Theatre in Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 Folgner's company was in an expansive phase, adding another new acquisition in 
San Diego, the Coach House-San Diego, to go with the two Orange County venues 
and a fourth in Ventura. The Galaxy-Coach House combination gave Folgner a 
seemingly unshakable lock on the club-level market for most major pop 
attractions in Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 High-profile country acts continued to stop at the Crazy Horse Steak House in 
Santa Ana, which was a hot venue even before it was cool to be country. In 
December, the Crazy Horse celebrated its 15th year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, however, a deep need for at least one more concert-caliber club in 
Orange County -- a grass-roots venue catering to the punk and alternative bands 
that were most responsible for giving the county a name in the wider music 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 The late-1993 closing of Bogart's, the Long Beach club that had been the hub 
of the O.C. grass-roots scene, remained a devastating loss. By year's end, no 
equivalent club had emerged -- one that could keep its overhead costs low 
enough to foster upcoming bands on the local scene, yet had the 
professional-caliber staging, sound and lights that would allow it to be a 
regular stop for hip, emerging touring acts not well-suited to the 
dinner-theater format of the Coach House and Galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
 The local scene for live alternative rock remained active despite the loss of 
Bogart's. But it was diffuse activity, scattered among smaller, less 
well-equipped clubs that generally lacked the ambition, the promotional 
resources, or the means to achieve a magical meld of local bands and 
interesting barnstormers. 
</P>
<P>
 Club Mesa in Costa Mesa and Club 369 in Fullerton were the most stable 
alternative rock venues. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny but lovingly programmed Linda's Doll Hut in Anaheim and the Heritage 
Brewing Co. in Dana Point offered good schedules of roots rock and alternative 
music, with the occasional interesting out-of-town act included in the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Old World in Huntington Beach and the Ice House in Fullerton catered to an 
all-ages audience of young ska and punk fans; the Ice House's future was 
jeopardized by a Dec. 16 stabbing incident at a punk show that left police 
demanding assurances that the hall could prevent violence by beefing up 
security or toning down the attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Two long-running venues -- the Marquee in Westminster and Club 5902 (formerly 
Night Moves) in Huntington Beach -- closed their doors, the Marquee a victim of 
the declining audience for heavy metal music, and Club 5902 succumbing to 
longstanding complaints about noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The year's most unfortunate club casualty was Our House, a Costa Mesa 
coffeehouse that offered well-programmed alternative music in a cozy setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Once- or twice-a-week rock soirees such as the Firecracker Lounge in Anaheim, 
run by rocker Tom Dumont of the band No Doubt, and the Foothill in Signal Hill, 
presided over by former Bogart's booker Steve Zepeda, gave bands and fans on 
the local scene some attractive options. 
</P>
<P>
 While nobody was keeping count, it was fairly obvious that '94 was a 
record-setting year in terms of the numbers of records released by local 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many O.C. bands took the do-it-yourself route, putting out cassettes and CDs 
on their own; others landed deals with such established independent labels as 
the Orange-based Doctor Dream and San Diego's Cargo Records. Lethal Records 
emerged as a promising new player on the grass-roots punk and alternative 
scene, with its focus on bands from Long Beach and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly any of the local releases were on major labels. Most of the O.C. bands 
with major deals -- Social Distortion, No Doubt, the Muffs, Water -- spent the 
year writing, recording or waiting for the business wheels to grind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the young punks made headlines, O.C.'s old guard of proven veterans held 
up admirably. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Offspring, Huntington Beach blues-rocker Walter Trout may have been 
the most visible Orange County pop figure of '94, although not exactly in the 
way he'd had in mind. Trout's hopes for his first U.S. release, "Tellin' 
Stories," fell flat as marketing support from his label, Silvertone, proved 
scant.  
</P>
<P>
 But he did enjoy a long run on a nationally aired TV commercial for the Jenny 
Craig weight-loss plan: "I was beginning to feel like the blimp of the blues," 
declared the guitar-slinging pitchman, who went on to tell viewers his tale of 
successful slimming. But with American success -- and the chance to tour 
domestically -- still eluding him, Trout and his band continued to ply Europe, 
where they have built a solid following over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong releases from the James Harman Band, Robert Lucas, Junior Watson, Big 
Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys, Barrelhouse and Lee Rocker's Big Blue made it a 
fertile year on the local roots-rock and blues scene. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was a good year for old O.C. surfer dudes: 57-year-old Dick Dale 
continued his midlife revival with "Unknown Territory," his second album of 
guitar meltdown in two years, and followed it up with extensive touring. Dale's 
1962 surf classic, "Misirlou," took a high-profile ride as the opening-credits 
music in the hit film "Pulp Fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chantays returned with "Next Set," their first album in 30 years, and it 
was a model of dramatic sonic architecture in the classic surf-rock style. The 
Lively Ones' song "Surf Rider" also made it onto the hot-selling "Pulp Fiction" 
soundtrack, and the band's Del-Fi Records catalogue from 1963-64 was reissued. 
</P>
<P>
 The cream of the Orange County country scene, Chris Gaffney and Jann Browne, 
both found a recording home on the Swiss label Red Moon and made multiple 
performing visits to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaffney's album, "Man of Somebody's Dreams," was a live sizzler recorded at 
his overseas debut in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne's "Count Me In" was one of the most engaging albums ever by a local 
artist. Helped by a superb cast of Southern California players, she remade 
herself from the honorable, tradition-minded but somewhat conservative 
contender for mainstream country acceptance that she had been, into a fiercely 
independent, convincingly gutsy yet utterly charming fountain of creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. sales were 3 million-odd behind the Offspring's, limited to however 
many albums she could haul back from Switzerland for her local fans. But signs 
were strong at year's end that "Count Me In" would see a U.S. release in '95 on 
a new label with major distribution being launched by Barbara Orbison, widow of 
Roy Orbison.  
</P>
<P>
 While 1994 was certainly the year for Orange County to hail the rise of young 
punks, Browne's creative rebirth was a close-to-home reminder that surprising 
and wonderful things can happen past 40.

AHMANSON FUNDS ANOTHER LACMA GEM: 'SIR WYNDHAM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the 72nd time in 22 years, the Ahmanson Foundation has provided the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art with funds to make a significant addition to its 
collection. More often than not, these gifts have been European Old Master 
paintings. The latest -- a life-size portrait of an English gentleman on a 
Grand Tour of Europe, painted in 1759 by Italian artist Pompeo Batoni and 
purchased from a dealer at an undisclosed price -- is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ahmanson Foundation's devotion to the museum is overwhelming," board of 
trustees president William A. Mingst said in a telephone interview. "This 
source of support, for so many years, has added key pieces to the permanent 
collection . . . and greatly enhanced the museum's value as a community 
resource in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The new addition is "Sir Wyndham Knatchbull-Wyndham," an oil-on-canvas work 
measuring about 7 1/2 feet by 5 1/2 feet. The portrait will go on view at the 
museum in the spring, after being cleaned and studied in LACMA's conservation 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting portrays an ebullient young aristocrat wearing an elegant costume 
and a pouf of white drapery over one arm -- leaving no doubt about his 
privileged status. Painted in Rome, in a richly appointed room with a view of 
an idyllic countryside, Sir Wyndham is surrounded with images that signify the 
sights and cultural experiences that educated Englishmen were expected to enjoy 
on their continental travels. He points to a view of Tivoli, a tourist 
destination northeast of Rome, while gazing at a bust of Minerva, the ancient 
Roman goddess of wisdom, technical skill and invention. 
</P>
<P>
 Batoni was born in Lucca in 1708, the son of a goldsmith. He moved to Rome in 
1727 and established himself as a painter of historical, religious and 
allegorical subjects before turning to portraiture. Today, Batoni is little 
known outside scholarly circles, but he was one of the wealthiest and most 
successful painters of the 18th-Century Roman School. By 1758, he had become 
the premier portrait painter in Europe, whose subjects included emperors, dukes 
and popes. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also the acknowledged master of the Grand Tour genre, finding a 
lucrative market in a parade of English noblemen who considered foreign travel 
part of their classical education -- as well as their birthright. Apparently 
they loved to have their journeys recorded in portraits, and Batoni was only 
too happy to accommodate them. He depicted his affluent tourist clients as 
energetic members of a leisure class who had the world at their command. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sir Wyndham Knatchbull-Wyndham" is a prime example of Batoni's full-length 
portraiture. According to J. Patrice Marandel, LACMA's curator of European 
painting and sculpture, it provides a historical and stylistic connection 
between two other works in the museum's collection, Italian painter Guido 
Reni's portrait of Cardinal Roberto Ubaldino (a 1983 gift of the Ahmanson 
Foundation) and a romantic image of 2nd Lt. Charles Legrand by French artist 
Antoine-Jean Gros.  
</P>
<P>
 The new acquisition brings public attention to a work that has been carefully 
preserved since its creation -- about 235 years ago -- in the subject's family 
home at Mersham le Hatch in Kent. The reason for selling the portrait has not 
been disclosed, but it is in unusually good condition because it stayed in one 
place with a family that prized it, according to Joseph Fronek, senior 
paintings conservator at LACMA. 
</P>
<P>
 The work's admirable state of health is also a tribute to Batoni's technical 
mastery, Fronek said. The pigments have retained their original colors and 
impasto details have remained intact. The painting probably hasn't been cleaned 
for 80 years, he said. Dirt and discolored varnish must be removed, he said, 
but little restoration is needed.

1994: THE YEAR IN REVIEW; WHO WAS BEST IN 1994? JUST ASK OUR CRITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our pop critics' favorite albums of the year run from Jann Browne's "Count Me 
In," Johnny Cash's "American Recordings" and Neil Young and Crazy Horse's 
"Sleeps With Angels," which all tied for the most votes, to relatively obscure 
releases by country singer Bob Woodruff and Cameroonian saxophonist Manu 
Dibango. Favorite concerts, meanwhile, included Buck Owens at the Crazy Horse, 
Love at the Coach House and the Offspring and the Pretenders at Irvine Meadows. 
Mike Boehm: Favorite Albums 
</P>
<P>
 In order of preference:  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 1. Jann Browne, "Count Me In" (Red Moon -- Swiss import): a shining link in 
the Southern California country-rock tradition that goes back to the Byrds, the 
Flying Burrito Brothers, Poco and Emmylou Harris. Cohesive, sumptuously 
melodic, emotionally vivid and insightful and, we hope, available domestically 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 2. R.E.M., "Monster" (Warner Bros.): Back to their garage-rock sources they 
went. But in toughening up their sound, the captains of the alternative 
movement didn't forget to be soulful. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Liquor Giants, "Here" (ESD): Pontiac Brothers alum Ward Dotson fully 
assimilated his Beatles/Kinks influences, maintained his Replacements-style 
plucky-loser viewpoint and served up a pure-pop masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Johnny Cash, "American Recordings" (American): Death and damnation, guilt 
and redemption are the main subject matter. But it's the sheer, stark presence 
of the man in black that dominates. A solo-acoustic Cash album was thought to 
be a daring move, but in retrospect, nobody is more qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Elvis Costello, "Brutal Youth" (Warner Bros.): Many Costello fans think he 
slipped with this one, but I find it one of the most delightfully catchy and 
inventively played albums of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Pavement, "Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain" (Matador): The band from Stockton's 
wisecracking, crusty stance belies the poignancy of its position as rock 
latecomers who can't invent the music afresh, but only can take a noisy ax to 
the legacy their heroes have handed down. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Various artists, "Songs From Chippy" (Hollywood): A posse of Texas 
songwriting luminaries led by Joe Ely and Butch Hancock crafted an evocative, 
timeless and mysterious folk-country song cycle based on the diaries of a 
prostitute in the Dust Bowl days. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Hole, "Live Through This" (DGC): One of rock's most famous widows has a 
good ear, a grabbing voice, and high-voltage emotional intensity, and she 
conveys them all with garage band simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Neil Young and Crazy Horse, "Sleeps With Angels" (Reprise): It's kind of 
the same ol' thing from ol' Neil, but it's up to the high standards of the 
artistic hot streak he's been on for the last five years. (Could be time for 
another recharging left turn, though, the kind he used to take back in the 
'80s.) 
</P>
<P>
 10. Gil Scott-Heron, "Spirits" (TVT): a strong comeback for the jazz-R&B 
songwriter, notable for the warm, openhearted stance he maintains while 
struggling with inner torments. 
</P>
<P>
 Honorable mentions:  
</P>
<P>
 Iris DeMent, "My Life" (Warner Bros.); Andy M. Stewart, "Man in the Moon"

 Orange County is broadly defined for the purposes of this list: It includes 
L.A.'s Liquor Giants and Long Beach's One Hit Wonder and Bierce in L.A. on the 
basis of longstanding historical and musical ties to the O.C. scene. Boehm 
feels that this easily is the strongest crop of O.C. rock he has encountered 
since he started covering music here in 1988.  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 1. Jann Browne, "Count Me In": I'll say no more lest I commence gushing, which 
is unseemly in a critic. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Liquor Giants, "Here": On top of everything else, it includes a loving 
cover of "Hold My Hand," a Dave Davies song that hardly anyone has heard. I 
hadn't, and that's saying something when it comes to the Kinks. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Eli Riddle, "Eli Riddle" (Vital Music): Modest Jon Melkerson is the best 
alternative-rock guitarist Orange County has produced, and the introspective 
songwriting, influenced by Television and Neil Young, is as strong as the 
playing on this do-it-yourself album. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Offspring, "Smash" (Epitaph): a punk rock album so catchy that it never 
gets tiresome. Its success was built mainly on the hooks, the sonic 
architecture and a memorable lead voice, but the lyrical substance is there, 
too, for those who want to look deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Chris Gaffney, "Man of Somebody's Dreams" (Red Moon -- Swiss import): would 
move up a few notches if it weren't a live album drawn mainly from the two 
Gaffney studio albums that topped this list in 1990 and '92. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Bierce in L.A., "Vale of Tears" (Rococo): Bierce's auteur , Stanley Wycoff, 
surrounds himself with superb players, grounds himself in country tradition, 
then starts taking potshots at its pieties in a gritty, jaundiced collection. 
</P>
<P>
 7. One Hit Wonder, "Not in This Town" (Lethal EP) and "Long Beach vs. the 
World" (Doctor Dream single): the state of the art in punk-pop. Songs that 
would make you hum incessantly if their tremendous clout didn't knock the wind 
out of you first. 
</P>
<P>
 8. James Harman Band, "Cards on the Table" (Black Top): Harman's 
always-infectious personality and blues acumen are backed by some of his 
strongest songs in years. Marks the auspicious recording debut of Robby Eason, 
teen-age guitarist extraordinaire. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Big Sandy and His Fly-Rite Boys, "Jumpin' From 6 to 6" (HighTone): 
Rockabilly merges with Western swing and a touch of R&B in music that could be 
dubbed '50s nostalgia if it weren't so completely vibrant and infectious. The 
best sort of good-time rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Chantays, "Next Set" (Chantay Productions): Their first new album since 
1964 rides a wave of cool fire with clean, taut surf-rock guitar architecture. 
Strong new material complements remade oldies from Surfin' Valhalla. 
</P>

 Favorite Albums 
</P>
<P>
 In order of preference:  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 1. Johnny Cash, "American Recordings" (American): Harrowing songs about sin 
and redemption, faith and temptation are delivered with naked power by an 
American legend. Unlike anything else in the Man in Black's remarkable career. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Neil Young and Crazy Horse, "Sleeps With Angels" (Reprise): Young's fury 
about an increasingly violent society and its tragic effects come through loud 
and clear in his raw lyrics and his stinging guitar work. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Iris DeMent, "My Life" (Warner Bros.): This has a more consistently somber 
tone than her knockout 1993 debut album, but DeMent's songs about love, loss 
and family are every bit as richly observed and expressively sung. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Jann Browne, "Count Me In" (Red Moon): This Orange County country artist 
put together a group of songs as accessible as anything out of Nashville and 
more insightfully written than 99% of what's on the country charts. So why is 
this killer album available only in Europe? 
</P>
<P>
 5. The Proclaimers, "Hit the Highway" (Chrysalis): Craig and Charlie Reid, 
Scotland's twin folk rockers, fleshed out their folk-skiffle sound with full 
rock instrumentation on their third album. It makes their songs about the quest 
for faith in an often-faithless world that much more powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 6. The Mavericks, "What a Crying Shame" (MCA): This is part of the 1% of 
Nashville country that matters. Raul Malo's songwriting has gotten razor sharp 
on the group's second album. His writing, singing and the band's playing can 
evoke the grandeur of Roy Orbison, the ache of Hank Williams or the sheer fun 
of Buck Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Crowded House, "Together Alone" (Capitol): You'll look long and hard before 
finding a more graceful, tuneful or thoughtful pure pop album. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Beausoleil, "L'Echo" (Forward): a living, breathing, moving tribute to the 
pioneering Cajun and zydeco musicians who inspired the boys of Beausoleil, the 
best Cajun band in the land. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Various artists, "Tulare Dust: A Songwriters' Salute to Merle Haggard" 
(HighTone): Haggard's songs chronicling the seemingly eternal struggles facing 
the working class are given ideal treatments by the likes of Joe Ely, Rosie 
Flores, Billy Joe Shaver and others. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Bob Woodruff, "Dreams and Saturday Nights" (Asylum): Woodruff's solid 
debut album evokes the underdog spirit of Gram Parsons. Lewis: Favorite

 Favorite Albums

<P>
 In order of preference:  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 1. Pat McLaughlin, "Unglued" (Dos Records): I've listened to knockabout 
singer/songwriter McLaughlin's disc easily 100 times past these 12 months, and 
it still stands -- in clear spite of its obfuscatory lyrics -- as the most 
emotionally direct, affecting and timeless music I've heard this year. Think 
John Hiatt. Think Van Morrison. Then think of someone that good who you've 
never heard. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Ted Hawkins, "The Next Hundred Years" (DGC Records): If Sam Cooke had spent 
a long life scraping by, playing for change on sidewalks, he well might sound 
like this. Hawkins has Cooke's melodic sweetness, melodic knack and expressive 
voice, but they're all shaped by a life of hard experience. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Richard Thompson, "Mirror Blue" (Capitol Records): Not one track here can 
equal Thompson's spellbinding live versions, but even so, this remains a 
remarkable piece of songcrafting. "Beeswing" alone contains more narrative 
heartbreak than most albums. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Jann Browne, "Count Me In" (Red Moon -- Swiss import): No local favoritism 
here. Browne and her band have come up with deeply etched songs and 
heart-tugging performances that put most other country acts to shame. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Junior Watson, "Long Overdue" (Black Top): O.C. guitarist Watson plays so 
authentically within blues tradition that you'd swear nothing here was recorded 
after 1959, yet his whimsically stinging solos show that tradition puts no 
limits on invention and immediacy. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Neil Young and Crazy Horse, "Sleeps With Angels" (Reprise Records): Hard to 
believe this guy ever put up with Crosby, Stills & Nash. It's the usual Young 
fare here: the limited voice, the squonky, over-the-top guitar work, and the 
songs that somehow make it all fresh and vital one more time. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Chris Gaffney, "Man of Somebody's Dreams" (Red Moon -- Swiss import): This 
live album of singer Gaffney backed by his guitarist Danny Ott and Jann 
Browne's band is a fine sampling of his gritty country style and distinctive 
songs. He's better with his own band -- which plays bars in Orange County 
almost weekly -- but the closing "Waltz for Minnie" here packs more emotion 
than a year of Nashville output. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Manu Dibango, "Wakafrica" (Giant): Cameroonian saxophonist Dibango makes a 
rich musical tour of his continent with help from King Sunny Ade, Salif Keita, 
Youssou N'Dour and others. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Jimmy Vaughan, "Strange Pleasure" (CBS Records): With his debut solo album 
-- and first outing since brother Stevie Ray's tragic death -- Vaughan gives 
the blues some fresh twists, with rich vocal harmonies and jazzy organ, and 
songs that are like a dip in a spiritual pool. 
</P>
<P>
 10. The Chantays, "Next Set" (Chantay Productions): While Dick Dale is basking 
in his justly deserved revival, the originators of "Pipeline" have come back 
from lounge hell with a powerful, evocative set of surf instrumentals.

<P>
 Favorite Albums 
</P>
<P>
 No particular order:  
</P>
<P>
 1. War, "Peace Sign" (Avenue): These '70s hitmakers have been an inspiration 
to many modern hip-hop and acid jazz artists (not to mention one of the most 
frequently sampled acts of all time), but who would have guessed that they'd 
come back in 1994 with perhaps the most vital and interesting album of their 
career? The title cut and "East L.A." sound better than "Low Rider" and "The 
Cisco Kid" when played back to back. The efforts of contemporary imitators such 
as the Solsonics come off as anemic in comparison. Still fresh, still 
throbbing, still able to pack any dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Black 47, "Home of the Brave" (SBK/EMI): Sounding like a raging cross 
between the Clash, Doxy's Midnight Runners and Bruce Springsteen, Black 47 
proves that rock can still be angry and rebellious without being whining or 
self-important, can still be loud and aggressive without being tuneless and 
overbearing. Frontman/principal songwriter Larry Kirwan sings political anthems 
about his native Ireland with a rare passion and intelligence, while the band 
somehow negotiates a seamless truce between traditional Celtic melody and punk 
sensibility. An-often jolting album from a group that deserves wider 
recognition outside of its New York base of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Buster Poindexter, "Buster's Happy Hour" (Forward): In a year when swing 
and classic R & B made something of a mini-comeback, Brian Setzer's 
embarrassingly whitebread but Disney-backed project seemed to garner all the 
attention. That's unfortunate, because Buster's overlooked gem of an album is 
the real goods, full of period attitude, swinging arrangements, 
whiskey-marinated originals and solid covers, which range from Roy Brown and 
Joe Liggins to the Kinks (!?!). Buster croons and shouts like a real pro, his 
band jumps the blues till the walls vibrate with brassy ecstasy. "The Worst 
Beer I Ever Had" ought to be required programming on every dive-bar jukebox in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 4. "Backbeat," original motion picture soundtrack (Virgin): Not the album that 
features a studio band waxing covers of the Beatles waxing covers, but the 
surprisingly enjoyable album of original jazz compositions by Don Was. 
Trumpeter Terrence Blanchard and saxophonist David McMurray shine brightly 
here, turning in lyrical, intriguing solos throughout, and Was must be credited 
for linking Bo Diddley to John Coltrane on the eye-opening "You Asked, I Came." 
This album is more original and purely listenable than anything released by 
such young lions as Joshua Redman and Wynton Marsalis this year, a surprising 
testament to the principals and a damning indictment of stagnation in the 
modern jazz scene. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Johnny Cash, "American Recordings" (American): The simple pleasures of 
Cash's reassuring baritone, a warm-sounding acoustic guitar and a batch of 
homespun folk songs remain relevant and essential listening. It takes as much 
nerve to record an album like this in 1994 as it does raw, native instinct and 
pure talent to actually pull it off without sounding like you're trying too 
hard. Cash even manages to inject soul and wisdom into a song by heavy-metal 
muscleman Glen Danzig -- no small accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Ben Harper, "Welcome to the Cruel World" (Virgin): If Harper is a 
singer/songwriter sorely in need of a sense of humor, chalk it up to youthful 
intransigence -- everyone believes they have all the answers at age 23. Harper 
still manages to display extraordinary originality in his songcraft, vocal 
technique and bottleneck guitar chops on this, the debut album of the year. 
Plus, his spiritual/political vision is refreshing and intelligent, if sadly 
idealistic/unrealistic, in the age of Newt Gingrich, Jesse Helms and 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Dr. John, "Television" (GRP/MCA): The Good Doctor returns to what he truly 
excels at, with a swampy, steaming album of New Orleans funk that picks up 
where he left off way back in 1973, with his career-best "In the Right Place" 
album. He could've done without the rap interlude by Anthony Kiedes, though, 
which sounds more like an old man's grudging nod to the contemporary than it 
does a vital ingredient in a Dr. John prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Jerry Jeff Walker, "Viva Luckenbach!" (Rykodisc): definitely an acquired 
taste, but just as fine as chorizo con huevos washed down with a Lone Star beer 
once you've developed it. Walker and the Gonzo Compadres return to Luckenbach 
to record a live disc on the 20th anniversary of his celebrated "Viva 
Terlingua!" album. New tunes, old tunes, celebrations of Texas and its crazed 
inhabitants, all of which are sung in a pleasantly artless manner and feel as 
easy and comfortable as a beat-up old Stetson. Metaphysical quotation: "The 
call us the Gonzo Compadres/Los gatos con queso/And we love our mommies." 
</P>
<P>
 9. Al Kooper, "ReKOOPERation" (MusicMasters): Onetime guitarist with the Royal 
Teens ("Short Stories"), Brill Building house composer, keyboardist on Dylan's 
prime cuts in the '60s and with the Blues Project, founder of Blood, Sweat & 
Tears -- not to mention producer, A & R man, author and underrated solo artist 
-- Kooper has been out of circulation for too many years. He returns here with 
a (mostly) instrumental jazz and R & B album featuring such old running 
partners as trumpeter Randy Brecker, bassists Harvey Brooks and Jim Fielder, 
plus legendary saxophonist Hank Crawford, New York guitar hotshot Jimmy Vivino 
and a host of others. The sound is sweaty, urban and seriously soulful, ala 
prime Ray Charles and Booker T. & The MG's. Kooper plays a meaner Hammond here 
than ever before, writes some sharp tunes and arranges some groovin' charts. 
Welcome back, don't be a stranger! 
</P>
<P>
 10. Various artists, "The Specialty Story" (Specialty): Five-disc box set 
chronicling the history of the Hollywood-based record label, best known as the 
home of Little Richard in his hit-making youth. The real story here, though, is 
the reintroduction of hot sides that have been out of print for eons by such 
important, seminal R & B figures as Roy Milton, Joe and Jimmy Liggins, Percy 
Mayfield, Larry Williams and Don & Dewey. It also includes obscure but vastly 
entertaining artists such a Daddy Cleanhead, Joe Lutcher and Jim Wynn as well 
as rare, early material by the likes of Sam Cooke, Lloyd Price, Clifton 
Chenier, John Lee Hooker, Jesse Belvin, Ernie K-Doe and more. The package 
includes a 44-page booklet, loaded with great photos and featuring incisive 
notes by anthology compiler and long-time studio fixture Billy Vera.

OLD ENOUGH TO SING THE PRAISES OF 'TOONS; ANIMATION: 'FANTASIA' OR BUGS BUNNY 
ISN'T JUST FOR KIDS. MORE THAN A THIRD OF THOSE WATCHING THE CARTOON NETWORK 
ARE OVER 18. SOME ARE EVEN RENOWNED ACADEMICIANS.

<BYLINE>

By CHRIS KALTENBACH, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A world-renowned scholar of T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound writes a book about the 
guy who created Wile E. Coyote. A cable channel that shows nothing but cartoons 
says a third of its audience is old enough to vote. Animation cels -- the 
hundreds of individual drawings that make up a six-minute cartoon -- sell for 
hundreds, even thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartoons may have a reputation for being kids' stuff; in fact, they're 
anything but. Just ask Ken Dennison, who regularly sits down in his Bel Air, 
Md., home to watch episodes of "Jonny Quest" with his 3-year-old son, Drew. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jonny Quest was just a good character," says Dennison, 30, a senior art 
director for the Baltimore advertising firm of W.B. Doner. "When I was a kid, I 
just watched it because it was a cartoon and that's what you did. But now that 
I'm older, I realize it's nice fantasy stuff. They're just good." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennison's love of Jonny Quest and Scooby Doo has made him a big fan of the 
Cartoon Network, one of cable's fastest-growing channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely watch it a lot," he says. "I probably watch it too much, even 
more than ESPN." 
</P>
<P>
 The all-animation channel -- launched just over two years ago and another 
piece of the vast media empire lorded over by Ted Turner -- is already the 
fifth-most-popular cable network, according to numbers for the third quarter of 
1994. Although the majority of its audience may not be much older than the 
network itself, better than one-third of those tuning in are 18 or older. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to believe? It shouldn't be, animation aficionados say. Kids alone have 
not made "The Simpsons" a cultural touchstone or turned "Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit" into a box-office blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
 Great cartoons have always appealed to a wide range of ages and tastes. 
Consider: The winner of a recent poll asking animators to name the greatest 
cartoon of all time features Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd in a condensed version 
of a Wagnerian opera -- and plenty of adults own $100 laser-disc versions of 
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" that they wouldn't let their children 
anywhere near. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think adults respond just as well to color and movement at 35 years old as 
they do at 8," says Mike Lazzo, the Cartoon Network's vice president of 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each type of cartoon has its fans. Most popular among adults are cartoons 
produced by the Warner Bros. studios, mostly during the 1940s and '50s and 
featuring such stalwarts as Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, the Road Runner and that 
wisecracking epitome of cool, Bugs Bunny. Disney cartoons are slightly less 
popular, if only because they seem more specifically geared to children's 
tastes and don't wallow in the bad puns and sarcastic asides so prevalent in 
the Warner's canon. But plenty of adults would argue that films like "Fantasia" 
are among the greatest movies Hollywood has ever produced. 
</P>
<P>
 The team of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera first brought Tom and Jerry to 
the screen for MGM, then later went independent with the Flintstones, Yogi Bear 
and dozens of other characters. Walter Lantz was the creative force behind 
Woody Woodpecker, and Max Fleisher wielded the pen responsible for Betty Boop 
and Popeye. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of who created them, cartoon lovers agree, one maxim is a 
constant: A good cartoon is good entertainment. It makes you laugh, features 
appealing characters and holds up under repeated viewings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck Jones," who created Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, "used to say, 
'I never did them for kids, I did them for myself.' That's a very interesting 
quote," says Hugh Kenner, a renowned authority on modern Irish and American 
literature whose latest book, "A Flurry of Drawings," is a biography and 
critical assessment of Jones. (A new Road Runner cartoon, "Chariots of Fur," is 
playing in movie theaters with "Richie Rich.") 
</P>
<P>
 Count Kenner, 71, a former Johns Hopkins professor now teaching at the 
University of Georgia, among the true believers. He believes great cartoons -- 
such as those in his extensive video collection -- are works of art. His 
biography of Jones is the third in the University of California Press' 
"Portraits of American Genius" series. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his favorites is "What's Opera, Doc?," the animated version of Wagner's 
Ring trilogy that Jones created in 1957. Its artistry, Kenner suggests, lies 
not simply in its artwork or dialogue, but in the way it transcends two 
different worlds. Although the music is Wagner's, the characters are definitely 
Looney Tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you close your eyes, you're hearing the real thing," Kenner said, speaking 
by phone from his home in Athens, Ga. "If you open your eyes, you're seeing 
Elmer Fudd trying to kill a rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
 For Dennison, the very unreality of cartoons is their greatest asset. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that leap from reality," he says. "Immediately, you suspend belief and 
you just sit there and watch it and enjoy it. You don't analyze it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many film critics would agree. In fact, several have theorized that Warner 
Bros. cartoons especially are successors to the slapstick comedies so popular 
in the days of the silents -- and also may explain why that sort of broad 
comedy has largely disappeared from the movies. Charlie Chaplin, they note, may 
have taken a great pratfall, but even his best couldn't match the sight of Wile 
E. Coyote plummeting off a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Murphy, a film editor and writer who lives in Bel Air, Md., favors the 
Disney animated features such as "Snow White," "Pinocchio" and the more recent 
"The Little Mermaid" and "The Lion King." 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a sense of innocent romanticism that you don't find in live-action 
features," says Murphy, 34. His favorite is "Beauty and the Beast." "It's 
exceptionally well done," he says. "It's a classic tale that can always endure 
one more telling." 
</P>

 Kenner, for one, finds cartoons are better when they avoid humans altogether 
-- one reason he prefers Warner Bros. to Disney. "The problem with 'Snow White' 
is the prince," he explains. "In Warner Bros., you don't get representations of 
humans. I think they're better for that reason. There's no confusion about what 
they're trying to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 But for many adults, trying to analyze why they like cartoons -- judging their 
artistry, looking for levels of meaning -- takes all the fun out of it. For 
them, cartoons are simply fun, and have been since they were kids. Isn't that 
enough? 
</P>
<P>
 "My generation grew up sitting in front of that cathode-ray tube every 
morning," says the Cartoon Network's Lazzo. "I don't think (watching cartoons) 
is a reluctance to let go or a nod to immaturity. I just think it's something 
that viewers of a certain age are comfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a great degree," he adds, "these characters became my generation's John 
Wayne."

A NEW THREAT TO S. AFRICA'S MUSICIANS; POLITICS: POST-APARTHEID INFLUX OF 
INTERNATIONAL STARS CHALLENGES THE LOCAL TALENT, WHICH HAS DEVELOPED IN 
ISOLATION. 
</P>

<P>
 The opening up of South Africa's cultural scene after long years of 
apartheid-inspired isolation strikes a bittersweet note for local musicians who 
fear being swamped by an onslaught of international competition. 
</P>
<P>
 They say that the end of international boycotts has attracted a parade of 
visiting foreign stars who formerly shunned South Africa -- and increased the 
fight for already scarce resources and limited radio time for local music. 
</P>
<P>
 Musicians' excitement over the end of censorship, the ability to return home 
after long years of exile and new exposure to foreign influences is often 
offset by what they say is a sidelining of a rich cultural heritage. Township 
swing jazz, for example, is often more popular abroad than at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that South African music has been in vogue in Europe and to a 
lesser degree in North America since the country's historic April elections, 
local artists, promoters and record producers are now concerned about 
protecting their turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're coming out of 30 years of cultural, political and economic isolation. 
South African culture has developed in an unnatural vacuum, and the standards 
achieved in musicianship, performance and composition have not been really 
tested against international competition," South African singer Johnny Clegg 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 He adds: "Musicians are struggling with the idea and reality that they have to 
compete with UB40, Sting, Whitney Houston and Phil Collins. There's a sense 
that we are second-class in our own country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are passive cultural receivers of the American product. We are trying now 
to adjust this. We have to balance out the wave of cultural flooding since the 
boycott was lifted and the promotion of our local culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Clegg, known as the "white Zulu" for his exuberant crossover music blending 
Western and ethnic styles, is one of the most successful South African 
musicians. But, like the others who have made it, such as singer Miriam Makeba 
and trumpet player Hugh Masekela, Clegg spends most of his time touring and 
selling records overseas because the market at home is not lucrative enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources cite, among the myriad problems, a dire lack of suitable 
venues to stage concerts and shows and the high costs of studio production for 
a public that is largely too poor to afford compact discs or cassette tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in a city of 2 million people, Johannesburg has only a handful 
of jazz and rock clubs and cafes. Many in the erstwhile music mecca, Hillbrow, 
in the city center, have closed down because of a vicious crime wave and high 
overhead costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a cultural inferiority complex here stemming perhaps from cultural 
isolation or boycotts over the years. It's got a lot to do with the apartheid 
legacy. People have been afraid at stages of history to go out. Here, musicians 
were virtually considered criminals," says Lloyd Ross, of Shifty Records, which 
produces little-known local artists abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great that we're finally on the international circuit and the 
Rolling Stones are coming next year. But radio here has to support the local 
industry. DJs are saying local musicians are inferior. This is untrue. There is 
definitely quality music here. But there has to be more money put into it," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even on independently run or black radio stations, a listener is more likely 
to hear American Top 40 tunes or soul hits than local bands such as Mango 
Groove, Ladysmith Black Mambazo or Lucky Dube. 
</P>
<P>
 Musicians struggling for survival in the post-apartheid era say everything 
hinges on opening air time to local content -- to give exposure and also shape 
consumer tastes. At a hearing last week, some of the country's top musicians 
bluntly told the new Independent Broadcasting Authority that there had to be a 
quota for local music to help preserve South Africa's unique sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids are learning hip-hop. They want to be Americans. And when Americans 
come here, they say: 'Where is Africa? Where are the beads? Where is the 
music?' " Masekela says. 
</P>
<P>
 For jazz musicians like Masekela, who left the country for decades to avoid 
bannings and political persecution by white rulers, the return home has been 
difficult at times. 
</P>
<P>
 The joy of being reunited with old friends and family has been tempered by 
small earnings and audiences, nostalgia for the adopted homes they left and 
difficulties adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Abdullah Ibrahim, better known as "Dollar Brand," eyed with dismay the 
audience of only a handful of people -- mostly friends -- who showed up to hear 
a recent concert at a plush Johannesburg hotel. It was a sorry showing compared 
to the large turnouts at Sweet Basil, the club in New York's Greenwich Village 
that he was accustomed to. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how it felt to be back in South Africa, he grew contemplative. "I would 
need many long moments to answer that question." After pausing, he adds: 
"Traumatic."

CHASEN'S, VENERABLE EATERY TO THE STARS, WILL CLOSE; LANDMARKS: DEVELOPER SAYS 
SYMBOL OF OLD HOLLYWOOD WILL REAPPEAR IN SOME FORM AT NEW SHOPPING CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Chasen's, the venerable West Hollywood restaurant that has fed more than half 
a century's worth of Presidents and movie stars, will close April 1 to make way 
for a shopping center, the developer confirmed Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Ira Smedra, head of the Downtown Los Angeles-based Beverly West Square 
Associates, said that a two-story, 89,000-square-foot retail center -- with a 
supermarket, a drugstore and a new, streamlined incarnation of the eatery -- is 
expected to be constructed sometime in late 1995 on the spot where Chasen's has 
stood for 58 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Smedra would not disclose the selling price, but said the long-rumored sale of 
the family-owned institution has been in the works for at least three months, 
and a formal contract has been signed. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners -- who declined comment -- had asked that the deal be kept quiet 
until after Jan. 1, when a letter from proprietor Maude Chasen was scheduled to 
go out to longtime clients announcing the "sad and exciting news," according to 
their real estate agent, Darrell R. Levonian. 
</P>
<P>
 But word of the impending sale leaked out in the wake of a meeting Tuesday 
night at which a group of incensed West Hollywood homeowners met with Smedra to 
air concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents said that, although Smedra had discussed the proposed 
development in detail with various city officials and one homeowners group, 
their organization had not been contacted until after members had heard about 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chasen's is only one restaurant, but he wants to build a huge mall," 
complained F. Reuveni, a 39-year-old homeowner who lives a half-block from 
Chasen's on Rosewood Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have the Beverly Center nearby, and Cedars-Sinai (Medical Center) 
and the Beverly Connection. And now this. We'll be suffocated by development." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, opponents said, shutting down Chasen's means the end of a landmark 
-- and an era. 
</P>
<P>
 "Movie stars, heads of studios and Presidents were regulars," said Kay Cantuo, 
a 70-year resident of West Hollywood who contended that the chateau-style 
building "represents Hollywood like no other establishment and should be 
preserved." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded Dec. 13, 1936, Chasen's got its start when Harold Ross, then editor of 
the New Yorker magazine, had a fateful conversation with a comedian friend. As 
the story goes, the comic, a moon-faced actor named Dave Chasen, had worried 
aloud about his future to Ross, and Ross urged him to get out of show biz and 
into the kitchen, where he felt Chasen's true talent lay. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are a wonderful cook, a wonderful host. Why not a restaurant?" Ross 
reportedly suggested. When Chasen agreed to take him up on it, Ross wired 
$3,500 to his pal, and Chasen's Southern Pit Barbecue was opened at Beverly 
Boulevard and Doheny Drive in what was then a Los Angeles County cornfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu consisted mainly of ribs, broiled chicken, hamburgers and chili, but 
because of Dave Chasen's popularity in Hollywood, it quickly became the stuff 
of Tinseltown legend. Director Frank Capra, who once directed Chasen in a film, 
ate there on the restaurant's opening night. So did Jimmy Cagney and Pat 
O'Brien. Alfred Hitchcock had his own booth, and Bob Hope, Grantland Rice and 
Randolph Scott once rode a horse into the eatery. 
</P>
<P>
 As the years passed, the prices rose and the restaurant grew. Soon there were 
those staples of all hot spots -- the good room and the better room. A special 
door was added for dignitaries, as politicians swarmed to the place. By 1985, 
Chasen's wife and hostess, Maude Chasen, was able to boast that she had 
entertained "every President since 1936, except Roosevelt -- and Mrs. Roosevelt 
came." 
</P>
<P>
 But the passing years also cemented the restaurant's reputation as a hangout 
for Hollywood's older set, as did its popularity in the 1980s as a favorite 
watering hole for President Ronald Reagan and his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the Reagan era, Chasen's was viewed mainly as gathering place 
for the sentimental -- the sort of place where you might run into George Burns 
and Joe DiMaggio, and, of course, the Reagans, but not the sort of place where 
you might overhear the next big movie deal being cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Business declined badly. Moreover, friends of the owners say, there was some 
question over who would run the restaurant for the family. After Dave Chasen 
died in 1973, his widow took over, but she is now in her 90s and the restaurant 
has became too difficult for her to manage, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, her daughter and son-in-law, Kay and Tom McKay of Bel-Air, 
have been overseeing the restaurant. But for at least the past year, rumors of 
its impending sale have circulated among local restaurateurs, many of whom have 
expressed interest in taking over such a well-known place, only to end up 
discouraged by its sprawling size. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has known for a long time that it was on the block," confided one 
regular. "But it has been risky for another restaurant to go in there." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maude always used to go out and visit with everyone, every night, at every 
table, always dressed immaculately in her Adolfo suits. Maude was Chasen's, and 
the daughter and son-in-law are just not Maude. They're quiet people. Maybe 
they just figured that they should sell it now, because, with anyone else, it 
just wouldn't be the same."

O.C. DEFICIT COULD TRIPLE TO $120 MILLION BY JUNE; BANKRUPTCY: COUNTY PROJECTS 
LOSS OF INTEREST INCOME. OFFICIALS INDICATE HARSHER CUTBACKS MAY BE NEEDED. 
</P>

<P>
 Only a week after announcing $40.2 million in budget cutbacks and savings, 
officials said Wednesday that Orange County's revenue shortfall for the next 
six months could be triple that amount and signaled that more severe measures 
will be needed to close the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit could reach $120 million by June, financial managers now say, 
because they no longer can count on earning interest on the county government's 
$2.7-billion share of the now-bankrupt Orange County investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to deal with an interest earnings loss of about $120 million," said 
Ernie Schneider, the county's administrative officer, who was counting on the 
interest income to balance the $470-million general fund budget through June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news Wednesday, three weeks into Orange County's bankruptcy: 
</P>
<P>
 * The county's top lawyer revealed for the first time that he accompanied 
former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron to a meeting in April with 
officials of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, but did not tell 
the Board of Supervisors about the agency's concerns over the county's 
high-risk investment strategy. County Counsel Terry Andrus said he did not 
believe it was necessary to alert supervisors at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 * It was learned that a treasury oversight committee recommended by the county 
auditor in 1987 was never officially convened because Citron strenuously 
resisted the idea and refused to participate, even on an experimental basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * A somber protest by about three dozen members of the Orange County Employees 
Assn. failed to persuade county officials to reinstate labor contracts that 
were voided after the county filed for bankruptcy Dec. 6. Labor leaders contend 
that layoffs can be accomplished quickly within contract guidelines, but county 
management says that process could cost the county millions of dollars in 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next step is our lawsuit," said John H. Sawyer, the association's general 
manager, who led the team that met with county leaders for about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * The beleaguered city of Montebello received a $14-million infusion from the 
investment pool, a key part of the Los Angeles County community's plan to avoid 
defaulting on a $25.6-million note payment due Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Huntington Beach City Council voted to sue Orange County if an agreement 
is not reached by Jan. 6 to release city property tax revenues frozen in the 
pool. Officials in Costa Mesa said they may do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
 * A dozen municipal bond firms expressed interest in helping the county sell 
bonds to bolster its finances -- a bailout strategy employed in the mid-1970s, 
when New York City teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. Among those interested: 
Goldman, Sachs & Co., Lehman Brothers, J.P. Morgan Securities and Bear Stearns 
& Co. Cash Advances 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the additional revenue losses calculated Wednesday may 
be offset somewhat by further cash advances from federal, state and local 
sources. It also is possible that the collapsed investment pool may yet 
generate some interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county is no longer counting on any money from a stream that had been 
budgeted to be its single biggest revenue source this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing deficit could mean even greater cutbacks than those already 
announced, and it could add urgency to talk of dipping into emergency funds and 
selling off county assets, such as John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation about the magnitude of the county's shortfall stunned labor 
leaders, who have equated $40.2-million worth of cuts and savings to a loss of 
800 to 1,000 jobs. Tripling the budget gap over just the next six months could 
mean much greater staff reductions, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer said the trio of county managers who announced the cutbacks last week 
made it clear at a Wednesday meeting that the budget situation was more serious 
than county officials had earlier believed. But they did not mention that the 
budget cuts might be significantly higher than the $40.2 million already 
announced, Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the severity of the crisis, he added, management should comply 
with bargaining agreements in laying off employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got the same position we had before," he said. "Whatever they can prove 
to us is necessary, we can work it out within the provisions of our contract. 
It makes it more severe, but the procedures are the same." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials' estimate of a huge loss in income over the next six months 
is based on their anticipated inability to collect $120 million in budgeted 
interest income from the now-collapsed investment fund, which has dropped $2.02 
billion in value this year. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials also are uncertain how much interest -- if any -- will be 
generated next year as the portfolio is liquidated and disbursed in U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one has come up with any firm ideas of how to cover a $120-million 
revenue shortfall in the next six months, county officials say they have 
reserves that will have to be emptied, such as $70 million set aside for 
"economic uncertainties." Meanwhile, officials said, the county has 1,525 
budgeted but unfilled jobs, and 2,256 current employees are eligible for early 
retirements that could ease the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The staggering new figure "adds an urgency to strategies that will produce 
additional revenue for the county," Supervisor William G. Steiner said. "The 
$40 million in cuts are only part of the solution." 
</P>
<P>
 The county treasury had invested $7.8 billion on behalf of 187 cities, school 
districts and other agencies in a high-risk investment strategy that backfired 
this year as interest rates rose and the value of the pool plunged 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 At a closed-door meeting Wednesday in Irvine City Hall, city and school 
officials from across the county expressed dismay at the county's assertion 
that it had not yet formed a clear picture of its fiscal condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to assume the county doesn't know," said Seal Beach City Manager Jerry 
L. Bankston. "They honestly do not know." 
</P>
<P>
 Another city manager who did not want to be identified said the county's 
financial management practices appeared to be "from the Stone Age." Accounting 
Firm 
</P>
<P>
 Cities and school districts with money tied up in the ill-fated investment 
pool plan to hire an accounting firm to help make sense of county records, said 
Craig A. Barbarosh, an attorney who represents some cities that invested in the 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we simply don't have equal access with the county to 
information," Barbarosh said. "We need to know what the county, as the debtor 
in this case, needs short-term as well as long-term. We need information from 
the county to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Mayor Victor Leipzig said there are "drumbeats of discontent" 
among municipalities that invested in the fund. But Leipzig added that public 
officials seem, for the most part, willing to work within the system set up 
last week by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John Ryan for distributing money from 
the fund on an emergency basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cities are committed to working with the county," Leipzig said. "But 
they're getting frustrated, because the county does not appear to be working 
with them. The county could solve a lot of their problems by being a little bit 
more upfront." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport-Mesa Unified School District board member Judy Franco said there have 
been no indications that the county has a long-range plan in place for dealing 
with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, where do we go from here?" Franco said. "There isn't a lot 
of information out there yet." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they are hopeful that ongoing negotiations with the county 
will lead to the distribution of some property tax revenues that have been held 
up since the bankruptcy filing. The county administers the money for the 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're negotiating with the county to get those funds made available to the 
cities and districts," Barbarosh said. "We're hopeful that those pre-bankruptcy 
petition dollars will be made available soon." Union Contracts 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, the county's management council -- made up of Sheriff Brad 
Gates, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and Health Care Agency Director Tom Uram 
-- spoke with union members about the county's dire economic picture. The three 
stood by their recommendation that the Board of Supervisors suspend union 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The county employees association had requested that the management council 
urge supervisors to rescind last Thursday's resolutions. Those actions 
superseded layoff provisions in employee contracts, which require that any 
terminations be based on seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopeful, but they certainly didn't agree with our request," Sawyer 
said. "They said they had made their decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Some employees said they felt betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "God knows how many countless hours I've sat in negotiations with the county," 
said Jim Best, a civilian employee with the Sheriff's Department who has been 
on union bargaining teams since 1982. "It makes me wonder, what have I done 
with all this time if they unilaterally rescind our contract?" 
</P>
<P>
 Best said he addressed the management council on the topics of "honesty, honor 
and dishonor." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every worker is angry. What are we going to do to remedy this situation?" he 
said. "I don't feel very comfortable knowing that my department head can 
arbitrarily lay me off two weeks from now." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce Moore, a deputy probation counselor, said he talked with Capizzi 
after the closed session and found him receptive to workers' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "He appeared to be agonizing over the process," said Moore, a 23-year county 
employee. "I think we might have moved him a fraction of an inch, to at least 
go back to the board and express our feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the union, which represents 11,000 of the county's 18,000 workers, 
expressed concerns about accrued benefits such as vacation, sick time and 
retirement money placed in deferred compensation accounts, employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting came as other unions researched the legality of last week's 
actions by the Board of Supervisors, which has asked county department heads to 
report back Jan. 10 with specific plans for budget cuts and layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Attorneys Assn. -- made up of about 300 lawyers from the 
offices of the district attorney, the public defender and the county counsel -- 
met with the management council Tuesday to discuss similar issues, said Paul 
Crost, who represents the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Crost said he made it clear that the association believed that its contracts 
should be reinstated and that accrued vacation hours should not be tied up in 
the bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be considering the legal ramifications of actions they have 
taken," Crost said.

MEXICO DOUBLES KEY RATE IN BID TO KEEP FOREIGN CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mexican government on Wednesday doubled a key short-term interest rate in 
a drastic bid to retain foreign investors, amid reports that the embattled 
nation has lost $8 billion in capital since its financial crisis erupted last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The higher rate -- along with reports that Mexico was negotiating with U.S. 
Treasury officials for emergency loans of up to $10 billion to quell the crisis 
-- helped the peso on Wednesday regain some of the value it had lost since its 
devaluation sparked the crisis nine days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The capital flight, equal to more than 12% of foreign investment in Mexico's 
financial system, could lead to inflation as high as 20% and plunge the Mexican 
economy into recession, economists said. The continued loss of foreign capital 
could also require the government to adopt strict slow-growth measures next 
year at a time when Mexican consumers were expecting a respite from six years 
of austerity. 
</P>
<P>
 To stem the capital outflow, the Mexican government on Wednesday raised 
interest rate yields on 28-day cetes, Mexican government bonds roughly 
equivalent to short-term U.S. Treasury bills. The rate was hiked by 15 
percentage points at the weekly government auction to 31%, the highest level in 
nearly five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate hike was interpreted as a strong signal that the government is 
willing to go to great lengths to attract and keep foreign capital. More than 
half the cetes in past auctions have been bought by foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 The peso closed Wednesday about 4.9750 to the dollar, an almost 10% gain from 
its 5.50 close late Tuesday, although it is still down more than 30% since Dec. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican stocks and bonds also rallied amid reports of the possible emergency 
credit. Mexico's benchmark Bolsa index rose 60.82 points, or 2.67%, to close at 
2,337.72 on Wednesday, and some individual stocks made huge gains. 
</P>
<P>
 The peso's partial recovery had been predicted by some who thought sellers 
overreacted to the Mexican government's announcement last week that it would 
allow the peso to float freely in value against the dollar. John Williamson, a 
fellow at the Institute for International Economics, predicted Wednesday that 
the peso could bounce back to as low as 4 per dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 But the capital flight report and the spike in interest rates were ominous 
signs, and they raised fears of a replay of the 1982 peso devaluation, when a 
sinking currency, sharply rising interest rates and spiraling inflation caused 
a wholesale exodus of capital from Mexico to offshore havens. 
</P>
<P>
 The short-term practical effect of capital flight and loss of foreign investor 
confidence is an unstable currency: The Mexican government has diminished 
foreign reserves at its disposal to try to prop up the peso. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher interest rates carry risks. The yields ultimately will be reflected in 
bank loans and passed on to Mexican consumers and businesses. By increasing the 
costs of many products and services, sustained high rates initially will create 
intense inflationary pressure, said Mauro Leos, vice president of operation at 
Ciemex/Wefa, a Philadelphia think tank that tracks foreign capital in and out 
of Mexico. High rates later could slow the economy by inhibiting spending and 
prompting people to save instead of spend. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are awaiting an economic plan to be released Monday by new President 
Ernesto Zedillo, who has been blamed for badly bungling the first Mexican 
devaluation in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The flight of $8 billion from Mexico's financial system since early last week 
was estimated by Ciemex/Wefa and corroborated by Carlos Zarazaga, a senior 
economist at the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve Bank. He said the outflow 
was equal to the amount of all new foreign investment that came into Mexico 
during 1994, thus wiping out any net gain. 
</P>
<P>
 The drain was caused by foreigners and Mexicans selling stocks and bonds and 
exchanging the peso proceeds for dollars, Leos said. The drain, combined with 
what the Mexican government has spent in recent months to defend its peso, has 
left the country with less than $6 billion in foreign reserves, down from $28 
billion in March, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic reduction in the Mexican government's reserves is what is 
spurring its efforts to arrange a credit line with the United States, Canada 
and the International Monetary Fund. The credit would give Mexico the resources 
it needs to begin defending and staking out a value for the peso, Leos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dwindling of foreign reserves was a principal reason for the devaluation. 
The government was also motivated by a desire to reverse its growing balance of 
payments deficit. By devaluing its currency, Mexico makes its goods more 
attractive on the international market. 
</P>
<P>
 Other side effects of shrinking foreign investment -- in a country that relies 
on foreign capital as heavily as Mexico does -- include a shrinkage in the 
money supply, a drop-off in spending by consumers and rising unemployment. Less 
capital means higher interest rates on loans taken out by credit-hungry 
borrowers, Zarazaga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capital flight "is extremely serious," Leos said. "It leaves the central bank 
with no power to influence the foreign exchange markets. It creates uncertainty 
in the outlook for economy in general because of the unstable currency."

SIMPSON LOSES A PRIVILEGE; OTHERS IN JAIL GAIN ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, moving to counter the perception 
that O.J. Simpson is getting special treatment in jail, disclosed Wednesday 
that new restrictions have been imposed on the football great and that his case 
has led to a liberalization of rules for other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Block revealed that Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, in a court order 
delivered late last week, has moved to curb what has been a persistent point of 
contention between the Sheriff's Department and Simpson's defense team -- 
unlimited visitation privileges by Simpson's friends and family included on a 
list of 52 "material witnesses" in his double homicide case. The list is the 
longest in recent memory and Block has contended it is part of a defense plan 
to circumvent jail policy by allowing visits in the attorney's room at hours 
not available to other inmates. Ito's recent order cuts back Simpson's private 
visits on weekends, the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff also said that all inmates involved in trials lasting longer than 
three weeks will be given hot dinners -- a perk that Simpson began receiving in 
November after a request by Ito and complaints by his attorneys that the Hall 
of Famer was becoming undernourished. 
</P>
<P>
 Block's comments came in response to growing criticism that Simpson is getting 
special treatment at the Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail, where the 
47-year-old former athlete has been incarcerated since he was charged with the 
June 12 murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle 
Goldman. Simpson has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the offensive at his monthly media open house, the sheriff defended his 
decision -- based on medical advice -- to give Simpson 10 extra hours of 
"freeway time" outside his high-security cell to stretch his legs each week. 
</P>
<P>
 Block, however, contradicted several points made by his spokesman to The Times 
last week about other privileges afforded to Simpson that are not granted to 
similar inmates classified as "keep-aways," high-security inmates who must be 
isolated because they are too dangerous or vulnerable to mix with the general 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Block said Simpson gets to shower every day when he has a court appearance, 
but otherwise must follow jail policy and shower every other day. He also 
acknowledged that Simpson is awakened later than most other inmates are for 
court appearances -- 6:30 a.m. compared to 5:30 a.m. -- but said that he is 
among dozens of other high-security prisoners whose special handling allows 
extra sleep because they are put in "security cages" in prisoner buses. For 
extra protection, Simpson is transported individually by van from the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sheriff maintained that Simpson gets no more opportunities to 
make phone calls than other inmates, spokesman Sgt. Larry Lincoln said late 
Wednesday that among the high-security prisoners, Simpson actually gets more 
access to the telephone outside his cell because of the greater number of 
freeway hours. 
</P>
<P>
 At his media briefing, Block repeated his contention that "alleged special 
treatment" is actually intended to facilitate operations at the jail, where 
Simpson is kept in isolation in a seven-cell wing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very important that everyone understands that an individual's 
status outside of the jail does not entitle them to any special treatment when 
they become a resident inside the jail," said Block, adding that defense team 
complaints about Simpson's jailhouse accommodations were "relative." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you come from a mansion in Brentwood, living in a 7-by-9-foot cell I 
imagine would be horrendous," Block said. "If you were some homeless person off 
the street who was suddenly given a warm place to sleep, three meals a day and 
medical attention, it would probably be an upgrade in your lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Block said Simpson's stay at the jail has prompted some 
recent changes in policy, giving other inmates privileges that Simpson's 
attorneys needed a court order to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
 One Simpson-inspired change, Block said, guarantees all prisoners tied up in a 
trial for three weeks or longer a warm meal when they return to their cells too 
late for dinner. This change essentially restores a practice that was in effect 
until about two months ago. At that time, said sheriff's Sgt. Ron Spear, a new 
state law allowed law enforcement agencies to reduce the number of hot meals 
and to give sack lunches to inmates returning late from court. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Simpson's attorneys complained that the routine was plunging 
their client into ill health because he was being forced to eat "mystery meat" 
sandwiches. Ito recommended and jail authorities agreed to have a warm meal 
waiting for Simpson if he missed dinner after his long day in court -- a 
blanket accommodation that Block said he now is extending to other prisoners 
involved in long trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "In evaluating it, it seemed like a reasonable thing to do," Block said about 
the change. The sheriff said it was instituted within the last week, but a 
spokesman later said warm meals have been available to qualified inmates since 
the first week of December. 
</P>
<P>
 Block also said that an order issued by Ito late last week now makes the 
jail's third-floor infirmary visiting room -- used almost exclusively by 
Simpson and his attorneys during the past few months on weekends -- available 
to any inmate and attorney on a "first-come" basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The same order, faxed to the county's attorney late Dec. 22 from the judge's 
home, also included the new restrictions on Simpson's visits. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness designations granted by Ito have long allowed girlfriend Paula 
Barbieri, Simpson's grown children and others to conduct private, non-contact 
visits with Simpson all week long, according to court papers and attorneys who 
have witnessed the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's order allows those private visits to continue during the week, but 
forces the "material witnesses" to follow routine procedure and use the less 
private, heavily populated jail public visiting room on weekends, Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 Block said Wednesday that Ito made the change at his department's behest 
"because we felt that there were too many visitors coming" to see Simpson. 
Block said there was "no question in my mind" that the designation of such a 
long material witness list was "part of a plan" to get Simpson out of his jail 
cell as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 By court order, Simpson -- unlike any of the 6,000 other inmates -- was 
allowed a visit by outsiders on Christmas Day. Block said four of Simpson's 
attorneys came to call on the holiday, and sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Ron Spear 
later said that no other inmate was accorded that privilege. Ito also asked in 
his order that Simpson's wheelchair-bound mother from San Francisco be allowed 
to visit Christmas Eve and again Monday morning, Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his decision to give Simpson an hour of freeway time in the morning and 
another hour in the evening, Block said he was following a medical directive by 
his staff based on an unspecified ailment suffered by the county's most famous 
prisoner. Block also said the extra time was in lieu of rooftop recreation, 
which Simpson has only taken advantage of once during his stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar high-security inmates are allowed only half an hour every other day of 
freeway time, in addition to two or three hours of recreation time on the 
jailhouse roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, Block said, uses most of his freeway time to sit in his cell reading 
rather than walking around. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of Simpson's lead attorneys, said Wednesday he was 
upset by suggestions that Simpson was being treated leniently while in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 When visitors come to see him, Simpson is kept in handcuffs, Cochran said, 
adding that during the entire past six months, Simpson has only been allowed on 
the rooftop for sunlight one time. What's more, Cochran added, Simpson's 
so-called "freeway time," though longer than that given to other inmates, still 
is more restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 "When all the other inmates get freeway time, they can talk to other inmates," 
Cochran said. "For O.J., it's five steps up, five steps back. Nothing else."

U.S. PILOT ADMITS 'ILLEGAL' FLIGHT, N. KOREA SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The stalemate over a captured U.S. military helicopter pilot in North Korea 
took a new twist Wednesday as the Pyongyang government said that he has 
admitted making an "illegal intrusion" into the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admit that this criminal action is inexcusable and unpardonable," pilot 
Bobby Hall was quoted as saying in a statement released by North Korea's 
official news agency. "However, at home, my parents, wife and kids are 
anxiously waiting for my return to them." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they could not confirm the authenticity of the seven-page, 
handwritten statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, President Clinton denied North Korean allegations that 
Hall was on an intelligence mission when he was shot down. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pyongyang, Hall admitted he was on a reconnaissance mission when 
his helicopter "deviated from the route" and crossed into North Korean 
airspace. 
</P>
<P>
 He is now pleading for mercy, the statement said. "I only hope, and it is my 
desire, that the Korean People's Army will leniently forgive me for my illegal 
intrusion so that I may return to my home and be with my family again." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear whether the statement, fabricated or not, might be a step 
toward ending the standoff over the pilot's fate or was yet another 
complication to a peaceful resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang has indicated that the U.S. government should apologize for spying 
in connection with the flight, in which the helicopter flown by Hall and fellow 
Army pilot David Hilemon crossed into North Korean airspace on Dec. 17 and was 
shot down, killing Hilemon. It was not immediately apparent whether the North 
Koreans considered Hall's statement tantamount to a confession of espionage. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's denial on Wednesday was the first time the President had personally 
rejected the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Korean officials returned the remains of Hilemon, who was buried 
with military honors Wednesday in Gig Harbor, Wash., but they have kept Hall 
and said their investigation is still under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton echoed the Administration's account that Hall's helicopter strayed 
across the border by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was on a routine training mission. That's all," the President told 
reporters at the White House. "They (Hall and Hilemon) made an error which we 
have acknowledged and drifted into North Korean airspace. . . . We want Airman 
Hall released. There is no reason to detain him. It was a routine training 
mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, State Department official Thomas Hubbard, sent by the Clinton 
Administration to talk with officials in Pyongyang about Hall's release, had no 
discernible success after his first day of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I understand the status of the talks that took place in North Korea today, 
they were not very satisfactory," said Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), outgoing 
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, the United States expressed regret for the helicopter's 
navigational errors. But in recent days, some Administration officials have 
come to believe that North Korea might be seeking an outright American apology 
for espionage. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said they cannot and will not make such an apology, 
because the helicopter was not on a spy mission. Clinton's public statement 
might have been designed to douse cold water on North Korean hopes for such an 
apology. 
</P>
<P>
 President Lyndon B. Johnson formally apologized to North Korea in 1968 when it 
was holding the American crew of the U.S. electronic surveillance ship Pueblo, 
which was monitoring communications off North Korea's coast. But Johnson 
retracted the apology soon afterward, saying it was made only to obtain the 
crew members' release. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard met for about 2 1/2 hours with officials of North Korea's Foreign 
Ministry. Additional sessions are scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts in Washington believe that the helicopter incident has touched 
off a dispute in Pyongyang between the Foreign Ministry, whose officials tend 
to favor releasing Hall to avoid further antagonizing the United States, and 
the Korean People's Army, whose hard-line military leaders are said to be 
pushing to hold Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether some officials in Pyongyang might be trying to use the Hall 
incident to scuttle the nuclear accord signed by the United States and North 
Korea in October, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry replied: "Everybody 
has theories. But we don't have . . . substantive facts that would allow us to 
make that conclusion."

<P>
 The present only seems to be bright in the garish glow of the Las Vegas Strip, 
and the future really has Chris Webster worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Curfew started for local teen-agers an hour ago, but they are just beginning 
to appear, cruising by Circus Circus casino in shiny cars with blaring music, 
hanging out with friends and laughing at tourists with active cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "See all the cars going up and down the strip?" asks a cold and bored Webster, 
18, as he loiters with friends outside McDonald's. "There's nothing else to do 
in Vegas. . . . if you don't have, like, a car, a whole bunch of money or at 
least a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Webster, an expert in diminished expectations, lacks all of the above and then 
some. 
</P>
<P>
 Skills: Dubious. 
</P>
<P>
 Education: Over, without a diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 Job prospects: Nil, save for minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term plans: To go back to Florida, where he last lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term plans: To stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had two friends shot," he says. "They were 16. They're dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Webster may not be your typical teen-ager, but then Nevada is no average 
childhood home. Frontier State, Silver State, Gambling State, Nevada always was 
designed more for the young at heart than the young in fact. Today, as it lures 
families to new resorts and master-planned neighborhoods, the nation's 
fastest-growing state can be hard on children. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the bottom in population, with just 1.4 million residents, it almost 
always makes the Top 10 in terms of trouble: teen-age suicide, teen-age 
pregnancy, violent death among the young, high school dropouts, lack of 
prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada's 24-hour lifestyle, centered on casinos and hotels, is one culprit in 
making life difficult for young people here. "The parents, if they work at 
night, they're not home with their children," said Anna Apodaca, a teacher's 
aide in Las Vegas schools. "The kids are basically left on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 But social scientists lay the greatest blame for Nevada's woes and the ills of 
its children on a decade of rapid growth and the shallow roots put down by many 
newcomers. Drawn by jobs in the burgeoning gambling economy, about 6,000 
residents pour into the state each month, the vast majority to the expanding 
urban sprawl of Las Vegas. Schools cannot be built nor teachers hired fast 
enough to absorb the children of arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
 The old heart of Las Vegas is surrounded by a ring of prosperous new suburban 
communities, all red-tile roofs and mini-malls stretching into the desert. For 
those who come with a down payment and a good job, Las Vegas can be a dream 
destination. But for those who arrive without such security, the boom town 
optimism fades quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends are recent, family distant and neighborhoods too new or too poor to 
provide much of a safety net. New arrivals find the slide down the economic 
ladder faster and the climb back harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this town, neighborhoods are either brand-new or decayed and trying to 
recover from that," says Mel Phillips, director of the Family Cabinet, a social 
service organization. "There is no stable neighborhood . . . no sense of 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 With unchecked growth and little stability, this is what you get: 
</P>
<P>
 * Teen-agers here attempt suicide at a rate twice the national average, 
according to the Nevada Suicide Study. "Our teen-agers are identifying 
themselves as victims of extreme stress," Roger Simon, executive director of a 
northern Nevada suicide prevention center, told the state Legislature. "They 
need help to cope and to stay alive." Starting this school year, the state has 
made classes in suicide prevention a requirement for high school graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nevada was the No. 2 state for teen-age pregnancies in 1990, the most recent 
year for which comparative statistics were available. School buses headed to 
certain Las Vegas campuses are fitted for use with baby seats -- protection for 
the children of children, sharing a ride to class in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the rush to accommodate the recent flood of students, the school district 
that serves the Las Vegas region added 900 extra teachers in the last school 
year. The district built 57 of its 187 schools in the past four years, more 
than any system in the nation, and 25 more are on the way. Still, many 
elementary schools run double sessions, with one shift of students arriving at 
7 a.m. and another heading home in evening darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 * Turnover in schools is high, making it harder for students to form deep 
relationships with classmates and teachers. Statewide, the student transiency 
rate is nearly 30% in elementary schools -- meaning 3 in 10 youngsters leave 
school during the year. High transiency is closely related to low achievement 
and giving up on school. The state has the highest percentage of teen-agers 
ages 16 to 19 who have not completed high school, and the dropout rate is 
rising. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nevada ranks sixth in the nation in the rate of violent juvenile deaths, 
according to a report published by the Annie E. Casey Foundation. The survey, 
which measures the living conditions of U.S. children, concludes that the 
condition of Nevada's children dropped in nine of 10 categories between 1985 
and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Nevada's troubles arise from the kinds of people lured here by the 
promises of a new life and plentiful jobs. Some were marginally employable back 
home, came here with little schooling or training and ended up disappointed by 
the reality of low salaries and strange hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the Silicon Valley," says Maria Chiarez, director of the Horizon 
Project, an alternative high school program helping teens complete their 
education. "We're not drawing Ph.D.s from Harvard and Davis. This is a 
working-class area." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of her classmates at Lunt Elementary School, 4-year-old Bianca 
Sosa's parents worked hellish hours in smoky casinos to make ends meet. They 
moved to Las Vegas from Juarez, Mexico, in 1987, early in the city's boom. Her 
father waits tables at the Golden Nugget from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., then goes to a 
day job running a dental lab. Bianca's mother, Blanca, worked at a variety of 
casinos, rising from change girl to front desk attendant, often working from 4 
p.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, Blanca quit to stay home, trading income for family stability. 
Her children were home alone for too many hours in a city she considers "the 
end of the world: shootings, drugs, kids out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 "And Bianca was staying at home once a week for four hours alone with my 
husband, but he had to sleep," she said. "I was very, very worried. We decided 
I had to quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Lunt Elementary, a crowded 5-year-old campus in a poor northeast neighborhood, 
is in some ways a microcosm of the problems facing many schools in Las Vegas. 
It has a high poverty rate, a growing percentage of students who speak Spanish 
as their first language, and a transiency rate of 41%, well above the state 
norm. 
</P>
<P>
 Bianca Sosa is enrolled in a special preschool program for youngsters 
considered at risk of educational failure. Each 4-year-old gets free meals and 
special attention -- an early stab at lowering the state's high dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year I had 75 students," said Ola Holliway, who teaches in a special 
program at Lunt. "I lost maybe half of them during the year . . . We have 
students who come in and maybe stay two, three weeks. It stops them from 
learning. They miss a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Schleppegrell, 16, has had a peripatetic education for a different 
reason. Durango High is the first school she has attended for longer than a 
year in Las Vegas. She hasn't moved since arriving from Hawaii in 1988; rather, 
redistricting to accommodate new campuses is to blame for her constant 
uprooting from friends and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Friday night, Tammy was one of a smattering of students cheering 
on the Durango Trailblazers in a basketball game at rival Rancho High. 
</P>
<P>
 "They brought (the overflow from) two schools together to form Durango," she 
says of her gleaming 1-year-old campus, which serves the exclusive Spanish 
Trails development. "There was a lot of tension. People aren't sure they like 
the school. There really is no school spirit. . . . We have a big absence 
problem. I guess people feel like they have no place in school." 
</P>
<P>
 When Tammy is not at a school event, she's likely to head over to Circus 
Circus, which beckons pink and prohibited. Although those under 21 are not 
allowed in casinos or bars, local youths come to play video games in the 
hotel's arcade, collect phone numbers from prospective dates and elude security 
guards. Teen-agers with out-of-town IDs can be on the Strip after 9 p.m., but 
locals can't.

 Security guard Steve Mahler, 21, has trouble telling them apart, even though 
he spent his own Friday nights not long ago cruising the same turf. Two hours 
after the Durango-Rancho game, he is chasing off younger incarnations of 
himself. "Las Vegas," he says, as he watches the ritual, "is for adults." 
</P>
<P>
 It is also for children who like to pretend, like Mindy Davison, 17. To this 
fledgling woman of the world, Circus Circus is already stale. Hanging in the 
McDonald's parking lot next door, laughing at the picture-taking tourists, got 
old fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can only go to the same place so many times," says the high school 
student and mother of one. "I like to do the older stuff, go to Excalibur and 
watch the bands. I'm not supposed to be there. If you're just riding around, 
they stop you. We get stopped all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 When Davison moved to Las Vegas in 1989, it was her sixth home in 12 years. 
Her education here has been just as tumultuous: four schools in five years. A 
difficult combination of risk and nonchalance, she has dropped out of school 
once. Of the social workers who hounded her back, she screws up her face and 
says, "Leave me alone. I'll just go back and repeat the year. It's not gonna 
kill me." 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the state department of health, the federal Centers for 
Disease Control came to Nevada in the early 1990s to explore why the suicide 
rate was higher for people of all ages than anywhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Patrick Meehan, who led the Nevada Suicide Study, came up with few 
answers. But he did discover that children who had recently moved had a higher 
rate of suicide than others did. "Mobility is an issue," says Meehan, now 
director of public health for the state of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 As Las Vegas races toward the million mark -- a population milestone expected 
early next year -- it is rapidly becoming the kind of city its new residents 
left behind when they moved. There are traffic jams, air pollution and gangs; 
violent crime jumped 11.7% statewide between 1988 and 1992, according to the 
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 But crimes involving school-age children grew at an even faster rate. Between 
1982 and 1990, the number of Clark County children charged with crimes rose 
70%, according to the county Department of Family and Youth Services; the 
number of school-age children rose only 40%. At the same time, child abuse and 
neglect complaints rose 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 Children here are increasingly likely to be touched by violence -- as victims 
or victimizers. Shamika Brown, 14, has been both. 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, she had seven sisters and brothers, but two, she says with a 
coolness born of pain, "are deceased." Natasha, 3, burned to death when Shamika 
was 1. LaDonna, 19, was stabbed to death while being robbed about two years 
ago. A brother was shot three times -- twice in the leg and once in the arm. 
Shamika herself was arrested for robbery and grand theft auto. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to live in Mississippi, where my mama is from," says the North Las 
Vegas girl, who attends a self-esteem program for first-time offenders. "It 
seems like someone gets killed here every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Homelessness is also up -- a factor that is reflected in the city's schools. 
From a low of "a couple hundred" in the early 1980s, the population of homeless 
children in the Clark County School District has mushroomed to about 1,800, 
says Kay Carl, assistant superintendent for elementary education. 
</P>
<P>
 One block of famous Las Vegas Boulevard, far from the neon of the glitzier 
Strip, is lined with full homeless shelters. Crossroads, the city's only 
shelter for intact families, has a 12-family waiting list for each cramped but 
clean room. St. Vincent Shelter, created for single men, this month broke its 
record for housing families -- 13 at once, crammed into 22 beds and a crib. A 
school bus is a regular visitor; it pulls away from Shelter Row more full every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5:30 on a recent morning at St. Vincent, Helen Ostrander curled her body 
around her sleeping children, warding off the day for just a few more moments. 
Leah, 9, fresh from the emergency room after an evening spent vomiting blood, 
had the porcelain face of a feverish child -- red lips, white skin, furrowed 
brow. 
</P>
<P>
 She will remain asleep when the lights blink on and the hundreds of men and 
clusters of families stretch and scratch and cough and sigh their way to 
consciousness. Her brother Jesse, 11 this day, bounds from the communal cot 
like a birthday boy. The celebration cake is a breakfast doughnut in a shelter 
dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Jesse, Leah and their mother moved to this boom town for a 
better life. What they found instead was a difficult city: high rents and low 
vacancy rates, high employment but low salaries. In an increasingly familiar 
Nevada story, the respiratory technician turned substitute teacher became an 
indigent mother of two. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse came home the other day in a brand new Mighty Morphin Power Rangers 
jacket and a pair of spotless LA Gear high tops, compliments of the Clark 
County schools. Helen Ostrander is glad of the help for her children, but could 
use a little help for herself. A job for starters, an affordable home where she 
can close the door and be alone with her children, where the only smells are 
the Ostranders' own. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got here," she says, "I was an aspiring professional, and now I'm a 
homeless indigent. It's the backbreaking effort of paying the rent. Salaries 
are unbelievably low, and rents are astronomical, and in between you have to 
feed your family." 
</P>

WOOLSEY RESIGNS AS CIA DIRECTOR; INTELLIGENCE: ESPIONAGE CHIEF WAS UNDER FIRE 
FOR HIS HANDLING OF THE AMES SPY CASE. HE LACKED STRONG SUPPORT IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE AND CONGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CIA director R. James Woolsey, under fire for months for his handling of the 
Aldrich H. Ames spy case and lacking strong support in the White House and 
Congress, resigned abruptly on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's first post-Cold War spy chief never forcefully seized control of 
a sprawling, $30-billion-a-year intelligence bureaucracy and was not seen by 
his own employees or by his overseers on Capitol Hill as a strong advocate of 
intelligence programs. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said Woolsey's resignation, communicated to President 
Clinton in a letter dated Monday, came without warning and was not requested by 
the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he accepted Woolsey's resignation "with regret," but aides 
indicated he did not try to talk Woolsey out of leaving when the two men spoke 
by telephone on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim Woolsey has been a staunch advocate of maintaining an intelligence 
capability that is second to none," Clinton said in a written statement that 
was notable for its mild praise and impersonal language. "Jim Woolsey deserves 
the gratitude of all Americans for his service to our country. He has my deep 
appreciation." 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey, 53, cited a desire to spend more time with his family as chief among 
his reasons for his resignation, effective at the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
 "In making the decision to return to the private sector . . . my family 
figures prominently," Woolsey said in a statement. "For their patience and 
understanding in the face of lost evenings, weekends and holidays, it is time 
for recompense." 
</P>
<P>
 A White House official said a successor has not yet been chosen. Among those 
whose names surfaced as rumors of Woolsey's imminent departure spread is Deputy 
Defense Secretary John M. Deutch, the second-ranking official at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential successor, defeated Democratic Rep. Dan Glickman of Kansas, 
the outgoing chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, was named 
agriculture secretary on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Glickman is known to have told Clinton that the President should get more 
personally involved in intelligence issues, and he has also criticized Woolsey 
publicly and privately for his response to the Ames case and other internal 
agency problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders say morale at the Central Intelligence Agency is at its lowest point 
in nearly 20 years, following the collapse of its main surveillance target -- 
the Soviet Union -- a succession of scandals, budget cuts and questions about 
its very reason for existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Woolsey never convincingly articulated a vision of the agency's 
mission in the uncertain world following the end of the Cold War, he has tried 
in television appearances and speeches to warn of the potential for conflict 
arising from regional and ethnic tensions around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 He has cited the threat from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
and the growing international trade in narcotics and other contraband as 
reasons for maintaining a robust intelligence capability. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey has been roundly criticized for his reaction to the Ames spy incident, 
the worst case of treachery in the CIA's 37-year history. Ames admitted selling 
the Russians vast quantities of critical information -- including the names of 
scores of agents working for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey reprimanded 11 current and retired CIA officers for allowing Ames to 
operate unimpeded for nearly eight years, but he did not fire, demote or 
prosecute anyone for complicity in Ames' crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 During Woolsey's tenure, the agency also came under fire in Congress for 
concealing the cost of a $310-million headquarters for the National 
Reconnaissance Office, the unit of the Air Force that operates spy satellites 
for the CIA and other intelligence agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, Woolsey approved a $410,000 payment to a senior female spy 
whose career was destroyed by subordinates she had disciplined for various 
improprieties, including spousal abuse, public drunkenness and repeated 
violations of agency security regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, Janine M. Brookner, alleged that the agency engaged in a pervasive 
pattern of sexual discrimination and harassment; the settlement was reached 
without Woolsey affirming or denying her charges. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House official who deals with intelligence matters said he and others 
in the Administration were perplexed at Woolsey's departure. While there were 
periodic complaints about the quality and timeliness of intelligence reports 
from the CIA, the official said the President and National Security Adviser 
Anthony Lake were generally satisfied with the agency's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim was not pushed; this came of his own free will," the official said. "I 
don't know his reasons and have no sense of why he felt compelled to resign at 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Like every agency director, Woolsey experienced his share of frustrations with 
Administration budget-writers, who are engaged in putting together the spending 
plan for the fiscal year beginning next October. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cuts penciled in for intelligence are modest and don't appear to be 
the precipitating event for Woolsey's departure, the White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times in late November and again on CNN's "Larry King 
Live" program earlier this week, Woolsey gave no inkling of his intention to 
leave government service. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked directly if he planned to quit soon, Woolsey said on Nov. 29: "In any of 
these jobs you always kind of take stock every once in a while, but as of now I 
have no plans to do anything different." 
</P>
<P>
 But close observers of the intelligence community have detected unhappiness 
with Woolsey for some time and suspected that he was a short-timer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I think there wasn't clear support out of the White House. And if 
there's not, then it's open season on the intelligence community," said former 
CIA director William H. Webster. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey, the agency's 16th director, served as undersecretary of the Navy in 
the Jimmy Carter Administration and has been a periodic adviser to Democratic 
and Republican presidents on arms control issues.

ORPHANAGE IN CHECHEN CAPITAL BOMBED; CAUCASUS: ATTACK HERALDS BEGINNING OF 
RUSSIAN ASSAULT ON CITY. CHILDREN ESCAPE INJURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hours after President Boris N. Yeltsin vowed to halt bombing that could cause 
civilian casualties, Russian warplanes early Wednesday morning devastated 
Chechnya's biggest orphanage, where about 60 children and 100 adults cowered in 
the basement, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in the bombing that heralded the long-expected, full-scale 
Russian attack on the rebel capital of Grozny. But old women and children who 
hid in the basement recalled the whine of the plane they heard at dawn and the 
sense of betrayal they felt over Yeltsin breaking his promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask Yeltsin this question," demanded Antonina Tikhonova, a 70-year-old ethnic 
Russian. "How can the Russian pilots we've always loved kill us, Russian 
children and old people?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nonstop bombing and shelling pounded the northeast and west of Grozny on 
Wednesday as Russian forces braved ferocious resistance and advanced into the 
besieged capital in a relentless final push to subdue the breakaway republic. 
</P>
<P>
 By midafternoon, the approaching rat-tat-tat of small arms fire in the city 
center indicated that Russian troops had broken through Chechen defenses and 
could carry out Kremlin plans to take the city before New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia denied it had bombed the orphanage or any other area of Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not work in Grozny today," insisted Valentin M. Sergeyev of the 
Russian government press center in Moscow. "We obeyed the president's order, 
which is the law for us." He called any report of the bombing "propaganda and 
provocation." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Russian officials claimed that Chechen rebels had fired a missile on the 
outlying village of Urus-Martan, killing nine civilians, then tried to blame 
the attack on the Russian air force. Russian air commanders claimed that not 
even reconnaissance flights had been made in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 40,000 Russian troops moved into Chechnya on Dec. 11 in a last-ditch 
Kremlin attempt to bring the rebellious republic to heel. The largely Muslim 
enclave of about 1.2 million people has put up fierce resistance to the Russian 
incursion, and President Dzhokar M. Dudayev of Chechnya declared in a televised 
address Tuesday that his troops would go "not one step back." 
</P>
<P>
 After 17 days of halting Russian advances, however, the Chechnya offensive 
appeared to be entering a decisive new phase. In a televised speech Tuesday, 
Yeltsin instructed Russian troops not to delay in disarming the "criminal 
gangs" he blamed for hijacking, terrorism, train robbery and drug- and 
weapons-trafficking, and they responded by waging battles in and around Grozny 
with renewed vigor. 
</P>
<P>
 Oleg I. Lobov, secretary of Yeltsin's Security Council, said Wednesday that 
troops were intent on bringing the city under control gradually with a minimum 
of bloodshed. Grozny "will not be taken by storm, but liberated," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the city shook under heavy bombing and shelling -- a deadly 
symphony of the deep booms of aviation bombs, the lighter thump of shelling and 
the staccato stutter of machine guns, sometimes all sounding at once. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't care where they bomb," said Magomed Khachkeyev, a soldier who came 
to help evacuate the remaining 60 or so orphanage children to an outlying 
village. "They want to erase the face of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 A heavy battle raged in the town of Argun, 10 miles east of Grozny, where 
Chechen troops were trying to hold off the Russian advance toward the capital. 
Truck-launched missiles and small arms fire dominated the ground exchanges as 
Russian bombardiers in helicopters flew overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Russia's vastly superior might, Chechen fighters claimed they had 
surrounded and captured a group of Russian soldiers in Argun. They said they 
had offered to let the Russians go if they would lay down their arms but that 
the captives responded that they lacked permission to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobov said Russian forces had taken the town of Pervomayskoye after days of 
intensive fighting and that they now control the airport in Khankala, a suburb 
of Grozny, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 On the psychological front, the Chechens hold a clear advantage. A fierce 
mountain people who fought czarist rule for decades in the 19th Century and 
were brutally deported by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, they have no lack of 
motivation. Many Chechen commandos wear green bandannas, denoting their status 
as suicide fighters planning to sacrifice their lives to defend their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a purely strategic plane, the Chechens are doomed to defeat by the 
military machine of the former superpower. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrecked buildings lining many of the streets of central Grozny testify to 
more than a week of Russian bombers attacking the city with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Children's World store just two blocks from Dudayev's presidential palace 
is a blown-out shell. The trees across the street are blackened skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
 The pretty pink Kavkaz Hotel across from the palace has lost one wing and most 
of its windows. Dzerzhinsky Street, a small area where Chechnya's poshest shop 
used to stand, has nothing left of its storefronts but rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the entrance to the city's Microdistrict No. 1 on Wednesday, a large 
crater and the mangled, burned-out frames of six cars attested to the bomb that 
hit the intersection there. Sheets that had been used to cover charred corpses 
still lay on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Grozny's snowy boulevards, building after building showed the marks of 
destruction. Several streets were flooded, and most of the city was without 
electricity. A music school was in ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechen sources said that Russian planes also bombed a radio transmitter in 
southwestern Grozny six times Wednesday morning, but missed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chechnya's central Republican Clinical Hospital, head nurse Tatyana 
Kitayeva said missiles had destroyed two of the hospital's operating rooms and 
that most of the wounded were being treated in a bomb shelter turned into a 
makeshift emergency ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no antibiotics, not enough anesthetics, not enough fluids and we're 
short on bandages," Kitayeva said. "We don't have enough of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The playground in the back yard of Orphanage No. 2 in the Leninsky district 
was cratered from the bombing attack. Whole families resigned to living in the 
bomb shelter until the fighting stops had reverted to a primitive existence, 
baking their own bread and snuggling together for warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeltsin is a fascist," said Nina Tsekhoyeva, a school administrator who moved 
into the orphanage basement after her home was bombed a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dudayev may be bad, we may be bad," she said, "but that doesn't mean we 
deserve this."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; COUNTY COUNSEL SAT IN ON SEC SESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE and MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although county supervisors blasted the Securities and Exchange Commission for 
failing to alert them to concerns over the county's investment fund, their own 
attorney acknowledged Wednesday that he was present when the federal agency 
first questioned then-Treasurer Robert L. Citron last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Andrus, the county counsel, told The Times on Wednesday that although 
SEC attorneys questioned Citron and then-Assistant Treasurer Matthew R. Raabe 
about their investment portfolio and the risky strategies, the inquiry did not 
seem serious enough to warrant a mention to county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the bright glare of hindsight, I guess I could have explained it to them, 
but there wouldn't have been much to explain," Andrus said. Citron's 
"explanation to the SEC . . . seemed plausible to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Andrus said, the inquiry was confidential and the four participants 
-- including securities attorney John W. Cotton, who was hired by the county -- 
were told not to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors, some of whom have been critical of the SEC's handling of 
the financial crisis in its initial stages, were surprised to learn Wednesday 
that Andrus had attended the meeting with the SEC months before it began a 
full-scale investigation into the fiscal debacle that unfolded earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the board should have been informed, and we weren't, and that 
concerns me," said Supervisor William G. Steiner, who criticized the SEC for 
failing to step in and freeze the troubled investment fund before the county 
declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez: "Certainly that knowledge would have been 
beneficial." 
</P>
<P>
 The battle between the supervisors and the SEC heated up earlier this month 
when the agency's chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr., referring indirectly to the 
supervisors, suggested that voters "throw out" any politicians who placed the 
public's savings in such speculative investments. 
</P>
<P>
 As county counsel, Andrus represents not only the Board of Supervisors but 
other elected county officials, including Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting with the SEC, which Andrus said occurred in April or May, 
Citron brought along Cotton, an attorney for LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, a 
Los Angeles law firm that served as counsel for several bond sales. Cotton had 
special expertise in securities law, Andrus said, and was asked to come along. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton did not return a call for comment Wednesday. Citron's attorney, David 
Wiechert, said he found nothing improper or unusual about Cotton, whose firm 
did securities work for the county, representing Citron before the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrus said he accompanied Citron and Raabe because he did not fully 
understand the nature and complexity of the investments and thought it might be 
a good "educational process." Andrus also said he could not adequately 
represent Citron during the meeting because he had no expertise in such 
financial matters. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, Andrus said, Raabe did most of the talking, answering 
dozens of questions about the portfolio, the maturity dates of securities and 
the risk of the investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was mostly for information purposes," Andrus said. "I understood that if 
they did have concerns, we'd hear back and we never did. There was nothing 
alarming or significant about the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said she learned a few days ago that 
Andrus had met with the SEC in the spring and was told that he was "just about 
admonished" not to discuss the inquiry. Wieder said that if Andrus believed he 
was representing Citron, there could be problems with attorney-client 
privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry Andrus is an impeccable counsel," Wieder said. "I think the SEC should 
be answering a lot of questions about why they backed off on this whole thing 
when we needed them." 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC has launched a broad investigation of county leaders and the 
brokerages that underwrote county bonds and sold investments to the 
now-bankrupt funds. The SEC has served subpoenas on the five county 
supervisors, county Administrator Ernie Schneider, Citron, Raabe and two Wall 
Street investment houses, seeking a variety of bank records, diaries and other 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is investigating whether campaign contributions, or even kickbacks, 
were provided to county officials in exchange for the county's lucrative bond 
business.

 It was supposed to shut down the campaign contribution pipeline from Wall

"paid to play" in the government bond business.

 But eight months after the federal government imposed an eagerly awaited 
control on the municipal bond industry, the Orange County bankruptcy disaster 
has revealed more loopholes than leverage in the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The new regulation "is turning out be loose as a sieve," said Zane Mann, 
publisher of the California Municipal Bond Adviser, a Palm Springs publication 
that advises private investors. "It's a joke, and I think that's the consensus 
in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by a series of public financing scandals across the nation, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year prohibited municipal 
finance firms from doing business with officials to whom they had given 
campaign contributions in the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators are not quite as discouraged in their assessment of the 
impact of their work, saying that the regulation marked an important first step 
toward cleaning up the process for awarding bond work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you the number of people (in the bond industry) who have come up 
to me and said 'Thank you, thank you -- you've saved me so much money. I don't 
have to be held up anymore by the politicians,' " said Christopher Taylor, 
executive director of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which drafted 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But even federal officials acknowledge that the rules they imposed may have to 
be tightened to close gaps that allow some finance professionals to evade them. 
If not, players in the bond industry will continue to influence the awarding of 
contracts through gifts and donations, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond underwriters and dealers are covered by the ban but investment brokers 
are not. Neither are bond lawyers. Financial advisers are -- but only if they 
are registered as bond dealers. And Wall Street underwriting firms can still 
give corporate contributions -- but only if their municipal finance 
professionals were not involved in donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann says the sense of bewilderment has become common in the finance industry, 
and it has led to many donations that may or may not be legal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seems like everyone can get around the technicalities by just changing their 
(professional) title. . . . Wives are making donations, back room clerks, 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 SEC General Counsel Simon M. Lorne agrees that "there are certainly some 
loopholes. I think the Orange County situation is likely to prompt 
reconsideration of municipal finance issues across the board . . . and 
certainly the contribution issue is one that's likely to be looked at." 
</P>
<P>
 A review of donations to Orange County officials shows that six firms active 
in the county's troubled bond business made contributions totaling more than 
$7,000 to former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron in the first six 
weeks after the donation ban went into effect April 25. More recent data is not 
available because most elected officials have not yet reported contributions 
for the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigative arm of the SEC is examining three donations from Merrill 
Lynch employees to Citron. But federal officials say these and other 
contributions made after the ban was imposed could be considered legal under 
the law's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.2-trillion municipal finance industry has proved a growing source of 
funding for politicians nationwide in the last decade, public records show. Its 
participants give municipal officials hundreds of thousands of dollars each 
year in campaign donations, meals, sports tickets and other gifts. The SEC 
regulation was aimed at drying up that source, but records show that the 
financial connections between Orange County politicians and key bond players 
have continued. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why BankAmerica Corp. and a subsidiary could donate $1,750 to Citron 
in May, federal officials say. The bank does not appear to be covered by the 
ban in its role as Orange County's bond trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is Leifer Capital, a Santa Monica firm that has earned more than $1 
million in recent years as financial adviser on Orange County's bond deals. The 
firm donated $1,000 to Citron's campaign fund in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Also outside the ban are bond attorneys and private auditors who routinely 
earned tens of thousands of dollars from county bond contracts and who donated 
a total of more than $500 to Citron's campaign after the ban took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics complain that they are left with an uneven playing field tilted toward 
bond lawyers, advisers and other financial professionals who are not covered by 
the ban. The Orange County bankruptcy, SEC Commissioner Rick Roberts said, "is 
another incident that has called into question some parts of (the regulation) 
-- primarily its breadth or lack thereof." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if a firm is involved in underwriting business -- which is covered by the 
ban -- contributions by top Wall Street executives may still be allowed. As a 
result, a senior vice president at Dean Witter could donate $100 to Supervisor 
William G. Steiner earlier this year without running into the ban -- if it is 
clear the executive had no direct involvement with municipal finance issues, 
federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the case of the Merrill Lynch contributions, which have drawn the most 
scrutiny, federal officials say it is still unclear whether regulations were 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Merrill Lynch brokers in Northern California, active in executing 
derivative investments for Citron, each donated $1,000 to him June 13 -- a day 
before the Board of Supervisors approved a $600-million bond issue that Merrill 
Lynch underwrote. The wife of Michael Stamenson, the lead broker in the deal, 
also contributed $1,000, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Teamsters Union has charged that these contributions violated the SEC 
regulations, but Taylor of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board said 
investment brokers would not necessarily be considered municipal finance 
professionals under the terms of the rules. Only if Stamenson or the other two 
contributors played a role in issuing the bonds would there be a legal problem, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, did Michael Stamenson attend any meetings where the (Orange 
County) notes and bonds were discussed?" Taylor said. "I have heard from other 
dealers -- who are always anxious to pile on in these situations -- that 
Stamenson was involved in financing in the County of Orange. . . . The minute 
you find him attending (finance) meetings, the jig is up." 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch, however, denies any suggestion of wrongdoing, saying that the 
contributions fell within the limits of the SEC law. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you come to work for Merrill Lynch, you don't necessarily check your 
constitutional rights (to support a candidate) at the door," said company 
spokesman James Wiggins. "Our view is that we have made every good-faith effort 
to follow both the letter and the spirit of the law. . . . We were not looking 
for loopholes." 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch was one of the first Wall Street firms to back the move for a 
contribution ban last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The new regulation grew out of a recent series of scandals in New Jersey, New 
York, Kentucky and elsewhere, all of which involved large payments from 
municipal finance firms to the officials who helped award them contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York City, for instance, Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman drew sharp 
criticism last year when her office recommended Fleet Securities as an 
underwriter on city bonds after Holtzman took a loan of nearly half a million 
dollars from Fleet to bolster her U.S. Senate campaign. In New Jersey, a top 
aide to then-Gov. Jim Florio was forced to quit last year after it was 
disclosed that Merrill Lynch had hired his tiny brokerage firm to take part in 
municipal underwriting for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 After publicity on the cases highlighted the "pay to play" problem, the 
industry moved last year to curb donations. Merrill Lynch and several dozen 
other leading underwriters pledged to begin a voluntary moratorium on 
contributions to local and state candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The move did not satisfy federal regulators, however, and SEC Chairman Arthur 
Levitt delivered a stinging speech in March, warning a group of state 
treasurers that conflicts inevitably arise when politicians accept money from 
those seeking municipal bond business. 
</P>
<P>
 That conflict, he said, threatens to erode investors' confidence in the system 
"if there is a perception that business is bought, that low cost and quality 
are not the chief criterion (in awarding bond contracts), that fraud is part of 
the deal," Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Levitt leading the way, the SEC approved the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 The imposition of an April 25 deadline opened up a flood of eleventh-hour 
contributions, with Citron receiving $3,750 in securities industry 
contributions in the three weeks before the ban took effect, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem stems from the fact that the SEC has only limited control 
over the players in the municipal finance business. Its jurisdiction centers on 
bond dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the gaps in the SEC ban will probably mean that other investigating 
agencies with broader mandates -- such as the Orange County district attorney's 
office -- may have to take the lead in investigating possible wrongdoing in the 
county's financial debacle. But in the long term, the case may produce further 
changes in federal regulations, as officials seek to work out kinks in the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorne, the SEC lawyer, came out publicly last month in support of efforts by 
government and the U.S. Bar to curb donations from bond attorneys to 
politicians and help improve the image of an industry that "has been infested 
with some of the most odious of practices." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Bond Lawyers has resisted such a moratorium on its own 
contributions, voting instead to encourage bond lawyers to fully disclose their 
financial donations. Some bond lawyers still deny any connection between 
donations and bond work, said Andrew Kintzinger, the association's president, 
but they appear to be in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over time, we have become sensitized to the very significant perception that 
'pay to play' is going on, and it is a problem that needs to be addressed," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other industry reforms appear likely, observers say. But the best hope for 
solving the "pay to play" phenomenon, said Robert M. Stern, co-author of 
California's political ethics act, may come only with campaign reform efforts 
aimed at limiting how much money candidates can accept and spend. 
</P>
<P>
 The cozy relationship between Wall Street underwriters and Orange County 
politicians only points up the need for such reforms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about people who are really giving contributions only because 
they want to have influence," he said. "You can make all the little rules you 
want, but as long as the big rule is that you have to raise money to win a 
campaign, that's all that really matters."

BRULTE WOOS DEMOCRATS WITH PLAN TO SHARE POWER; ASSEMBLY: GOP LEADER OFFERS 
PROPOSAL THAT WEAKENS THE SPEAKER'S POST. HE AND EX-SPEAKER WILLIE BROWN ARE 
DEADLOCKED AT 40 VOTES EACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Republican Assemblyman Jim Brulte said Wednesday that he is prepared to make 
another bid for election as Speaker of the California Assembly when it 
reconvenes Jan. 4, appealing for Democratic support on the basis of his pledge 
to democratize operation of the lower house of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 A major feature of his plan is a significant weakening of the Speaker's 
position, from which veteran Democrat Willie Brown of San Francisco had ruled 
virtually unchallenged for the past 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Power should be shifted to a stronger Rules Committee, and resources should be 
allocated based on proportional representation by Republicans and Democrats in 
the Legislature, Brulte said, although Republicans still would hold a slim 
majority on every committee if his plan succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, Brulte said he was not certain that he would have the 
required majority of votes to succeed Brown in what has been considered the 
state's second most powerful office after the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brulte told Times editors and reporters that he is encouraged on the basis 
of preliminary talks with some Democrats who were solidly united behind Brown 
when the Assembly met in Sacramento Dec. 5 for its biennial post-election 
organizational session. All 80 Assembly seats are filled for two-year terms 
every general election. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Nov. 8 election, Republicans won an unexpected majority of 41 to 39 and 
joyously looked forward to the routine election of Brulte as the new Speaker -- 
the first Republican in that position in a quarter of a century. But Paul 
Horcher of Diamond Bar switched party designation from Republican to 
independent and supported Brown, sending the body into a 40-40 deadlock in the 
speakership battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte said Wednesday, "Just because something was 40-40 on Dec. 5 doesn't 
mean it's 40-40 on Jan. 4." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte added: "I'm encouraged by Democrats who are willing to say, 'We know 
that ultimately you are going to be elected Speaker.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "That's great movement from where they were two weeks ago," Brulte said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte also said he believes that Brown has softened his position of two weeks 
ago that he would settle for nothing less than being reelected Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year-old Brulte, who was the Republican minority leader at the close of 
the 1993-94 session, said he believes that the Assembly, operating under his 
system, can accomplish major legislation during the next two years. He listed 
his legislative policy priorities as: 
</P>
<P>
 * Legal reforms, including an overhaul of the auto insurance system and 
penalties against people who file frivolous lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Additional reform of the state workers' compensation system to eliminate any 
payment for stress claims and allow payment only in cases where it was 
demonstrated that the predominant cause of injury actually occurred in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 * Additional criminal justice reform, including extension of the death penalty 
to fatal drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Welfare reform to give counties greater incentives to create programs that 
would move recipients off the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 * A top-to-bottom reform of the state Education Code and an overhaul of the 
state's system of public education from kindergarten through community college. 
Brulte acknowledged that he did not know what the elements of education reform 
might be. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte offered only conditional support at this point for the 15% state income 
tax cut that has been proposed to Republican Gov. Pete Wilson by his economic 
advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte said he first wanted to make sure that the state was going to have the 
sort of economic growth that the advisers were forecasting and would have 
enough tax income to provide for full funding of state education and other 
legitimate programs. If those conditions were met, he said, he would support 
the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 But little or nothing can happen in Sacramento as long as the Assembly 
speakership question remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 When it last met, the Assembly was at an impasse because the chief clerk, who 
was presiding in the absence of an elected Speaker, became ill and was 
hospitalized. Brown, a recognized master parliamentarian, took command of the 
Speaker's dais on the basis of being the senior member of the Assembly. 
Republicans refused to participate in any further deliberations because they 
did not trust Brown to conduct any further business fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the Speaker has wielded enormous power in the Assembly, even if 
he enjoyed a bare majority -- the sort Brulte seemed to have won Nov. 8. The 
Speaker has appointed all committee members, including chairs and vice chairs, 
and members of the Rules Committee. He also has decided which committees will 
hear which bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the Speaker has had total control over Assembly spending and hiring, 
including the size of the staff allotted to minority party members. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte's power-sharing proposal, based on a state ballot initiative approved 
by voters in 1984 but voided on a legal flaw, would strip the speakership of 
much of that power and give it to the party caucuses and the Rules Committee. 
In that respect, it would more closely resemble the power structure of the 
40-member Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte's plan would allow the minority party, not the Speaker, to pick its own 
members of the Rules Committee and other committees. The Rules Committee would 
be empowered to assign bills to committee, appoint committee chairs and vice 
chairs and allocate resources such as offices and desks on the Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Exceptions to the rules, which Brulte would like to see written into the state 
Constitution, would require a two-thirds vote of each house, making it 
virtually impossible for one party to completely dominate the Legislature, 
Brulte said. At present, rules routinely are waived by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans believe that they will win control of the Assembly by this spring 
in any event because Republicans are trying to force a recall election against 
Horcher as early as March or April. Brulte and others are confident that 
Horcher will be dumped in retaliation for his post-election defection and 
replaced in the same balloting by another, loyal, Republican. GOP partisans are 
particularly angry at Horcher because they claim that he promised during the 
fall campaign not to vote for Brown as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte said he will propose the power-sharing plan in any event, but is using 
it now as a lure for Democrats to justify breaking ranks with Brown to join a 
coalition leadership with Brulte. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was hand-delivered to the district offices of all Democratic Assembly 
members, including Brown, on Monday, Brulte said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm encouraged by Democrats who said, 'You know, we like Willie, but really 
we should make sure that some of the abuses of his speakership never again are 
allowed,' " Brulte said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Brown said late Wednesday that the Democratic leader was 
responding to Brulte in a letter that restated his earlier proposal that groups 
of Democrats and Republicans meet to fashion a bipartisan power-sharing 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 The aide said Brown was not necessarily rejecting Brulte's proposal, but was 
offering to "sit down and talk and come up with the best solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte said he thought that public anger over the Assembly deadlock would hurt 
the Democrats in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters of California voted for change, and I think we have two candidates 
for Speaker -- one (Brown) who is the candidate of the status quo and the other 
(Brulte) who is the candidate who wants to bring about the kind of change 
Californians voted for," Brulte said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I will predict that voters will be frustrated and angry if in fact they 
don't get what they bought at the polling place on Nov. 8," he added.

DOCTOR CONVICTED OF 2ND-DEGREE MURDER IN 2 TRAFFIC DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A Laguna Beach physician with a history of drunk driving arrests was convicted 
on two counts of second-degree murder Wednesday for causing a car wreck last 
year while intoxicated that killed a Mission Viejo couple and injured three 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ronald Allen, 32, who was well-known for treating poor AIDS patients, was 
found guilty by a Superior Court jury in Santa Ana after two days of 
deliberations. He faces a maximum term of 30 years to life in prison when he is 
sentenced Feb. 24 in the deaths of Mark and Noreen Minzey. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict brought exclamations of "Oh, God" and sobbing from friends and 
relatives of the Minzeys, and Jackie Rodriguez, who was in the courtroom. 
Rodriguez, who was riding with the couple, was injured in the crash, as was her 
sister, Danielle, and the Minzeys' daughter, Karie. Allen sat with his head 
bowed and eyes closed for most of the proceeding, showing no emotion as the 
verdicts were read. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was given a gift to save lives, and look what's done with it," Jackie 
Rodriguez said afterward. "He took two lives. He should just be put away and 
not be allowed to go back to the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Rebecca Rodriguez, the mother of Jackie and Danielle, 
said, "I was praying to God that the public was tired of drunk drivers, and 
today the jury's verdict shows me they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Noreen Minzey, 33, and Mark Minzey, 38, were on their way home after attending 
a daughter's softball game on July 11, 1993, when their car was struck head-on 
by Allen's rented vehicle on Santiago Canyon Road near Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash left their daughter, Karie Minzey, now 12, critically injured with 
broken bones and head injuries. Jackie Rodriguez, now 25, suffered burns on her 
legs. Danielle Rodriguez, now 12, sustained a broken arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen was found to have been driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most intoxicated drivers in fatal collisions are charged with vehicular 
manslaughter, which carries a maximum prison term of 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors took the unusual step of charging Allen with the most serious 
charges possible, arguing that his medical background and two prior arrests on 
suspicion of driving while intoxicated made him fully aware of the deadly risks 
when he got behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Deputy Public Defender Michael P. Giannini had asked jurors to 
convict Allen on lesser charges of manslaughter, arguing that his client was 
suffering from clinical depression and struggling financially. Just hours 
before the crash, Allen had learned that his father had died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 But jurors said that despite the tragic aspects of Allen's situation, he 
deserved a tough sentence because he must have known what could happen when he 
decided to drink, take drugs and drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's prior drunk driving arrests and medical training persuaded jurors that 
he had sufficient understanding that he could harm others when he took the 
wheel, said jury foreman John Gornik of Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't figure he was a bad person because of prior incidents, but we knew 
he knew the consequences," Gornik said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gornik added that jurors tried hard not to become emotionally involved in the 
case or step into the role of crusaders against drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we wanted to say was these are the laws and they were broken," he said.

DEFENDERS OF SHAKESPEARE DO PROTEST TOO MUCH, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dead white men are alive and well and being widely taught in college English 
courses, according to a study released Wednesday at the Modern Language Assn. 
convention here. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that authors such as William Shakespeare and Nathaniel 
Hawthorne, thought by some to be in danger of being displaced by the rise of 
multicultural studies, in fact continue to dominate the so-called "meat and 
potatoes" survey courses taken by most undergraduate English majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the study found that historical periods of literature still receive 
more attention in survey courses than post-World War II writings. While 
non-traditional and contemporary writers such as Toni Morrison and Alice Walker 
are sometimes included in survey courses, the study concluded that their 
inclusion has not resulted in the exclusion of writers who came before them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The findings should be reassuring to parents of college-age students," said 
Phyllis Franklin, the executive director of the MLA, a 31,000-member society of 
English, literature, linguistics and modern foreign language scholars that is 
the largest humanities association in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin said the MLA undertook the study, which identified authors and time 
periods taught in survey courses at 527 English departments in the 1990-91 
academic year, in part because the fate of traditional authors was presumed to 
be dire, but had not been studied in a systematic way. 
</P>
<P>
 The study comes at a time when continuing pressure to broaden literary 
scholarship to include different cultures and ethnic groups is being met by 
countervailing criticism. Some scholars have been vocal in their assertion that 
multiculturalism has gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
 But Patricia Meyer Spacks, the MLA's president and a professor at the 
University of Virginia, said the study does much to refute that view. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to try to see whether it was true that the great literature of the 
Western canon was disappearing from the curriculum of our universities," Spacks 
said. "That is not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the English departments that participated in the study, for example, nearly 
90% said they regularly included Geoffrey Chaucer in their British literature 
survey courses, while more than 70% included Shakespeare and John Milton. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the same departments said Hawthorne was regularly included in 
American literature survey courses, while more than 40% listed Herman Melville, 
Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson. By contrast, Morrison, Walker, Langston 
Hughes and Zora Neal Hurston were each listed by fewer than 2% of the English 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettina J. Huber, the MLA's director of research, acknowledged that the 
study's methodology might have contributed to this huge discrepancy because 
respondents were asked to list only five writers that they regularly included 
in survey courses, not to list all of the authors taught. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way of knowing whether the failure to mention a specific author 
is an oversight, represents a judgment that the author is unimportant, or is 
the result of the limitation on the number of authors a respondent could name," 
Huber wrote in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huber defended the results as the first systematic study about what is 
being taught nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about time periods regularly covered in survey courses, English 
departments put a clear emphasis on the more distant past.

 Two people were killed and 27 were injured in two chain-reaction pileups 
Wednesday during heavy fog on the Golden State Freeway near Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
 With visibility cut suddenly to just two feet in the Tejon Pass, 30 to 40 cars 
and 10 to 15 big rigs smashed into each other on the southbound side of 
Interstate 5 about 65 miles north of Los Angeles. Across the freeway, on the 
northbound side, about 10 cars slammed together. 
</P>
<P>
 The accidents about 12:30 p.m. closed the state's major north-south freeway 
for hours and caused the deaths of a trucker who was crushed in cab of his rig 
and a woman who was pronounced dead on arrival at a Santa Clarita hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so foggy you couldn't see nothing," said Pete Hand of Durand, Okla., a 
motorist caught -- but not hurt -- in the pileup on the southbound interstate. 
</P>
<P>
 Letitia Burton, a teacher from Mountain View, and her 12-year-old daughter 
also were heading south on the freeway when the weather turned "extremely 
foggy, scary foggy," Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 1989 Plymouth minivan smacked into a black car directly ahead. Seconds 
later, a U-Haul truck hit them from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were people walking around, cars all crumpled, we could smell gas," she 
said. "I just feel we were really blessed to be alive. Angels were watching 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 The wreckage was massive. Mangled cars littered the freeway, and a cluster of 
big rigs was sprawled across the southbound lanes, some twisted but still 
upright, others on their sides. On a nearby shoulder, the twisted hulks of two 
burnt trucks smoldered. 
</P>
<P>
 The northbound lanes of the freeway were opened within a couple hours of the 
accident. But the southbound lanes remained closed into the evening, causing a 
backup of several miles. Drivers stood around the wrecks, shivering in the rain 
and occasional snow that hindered the cleanup. Some motorists and police 
officers gathered near a burning truck in an effort to stay warm. 
</P>
<P>
 One family huddled in blankets, the younger of two boys clutching a teddy 
bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Fog is common in the Tejon Pass, which rises to 4,144 feet along the Golden 
State Freeway through the Tehachapi Mountains. A cold front moved through the 
area Wednesday, combining cool air and moisture to produce intensely heavy fog, 
weather officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Visibility "drops real fast up there," said California Highway Patrol Officer 
Rick Miler. "It starts raining and all of a sudden, boom, there's fog." 
</P>
<P>
 Details of what set off the chain-reaction wrecks on both sides of the freeway 
remained sketchy late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the southbound lanes, said Los Angeles County Fire Department Inspector 
Mark Savage, "There was an accident and other vehicles could not avoid that and 
there was a pileup." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen big rigs and several cars formed the main cluster of wrecks 
on that side, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the front, the driver of a truck carrying wood planks slammed head-on 
into a milk truck, Savage said. The lumber truck driver, in a rig marked by a 
brown and yellow sign from J & J Trucking of San Diego, was killed. His body 
was pinned for five hours in the cab, officials said. His name was withheld 
pending notification of his family. 
</P>
<P>
 A 25-year-old woman also involved in the southbound crash was taken to Henry 
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita, where she was pronounced dead 
on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 In another big rig traveling south, Albert Rodriguez, 11, and his father were 
near the front of the pileup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw these sticks on the road," Albert said, apparently referring to wooden 
planks, "and everyone started stopping. And then everyone started crashing into 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Hand, on vacation from Oklahoma with his wife, said he was driving about 35 
m.p.h. and several car lengths behind another car when "this pickup came up 
from behind and walloped the stuffing out of us." Other vehicles, he said, then 
rammed into the pickup, which banged repeatedly against his car. 
</P>
<P>
 At the back of the cluster, a big rig carrying 1,000 bags of kitty litter 
smashed into the back of another truck carrying lumber. Both trucks caught 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him up ahead," said the driver of the truck carrying the kitty litter, 
Edgar Gacobo, 35, who was not hurt. "I put my brakes on but I slid right into 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 The injured were taken by ambulance and helicopter to hospitals stretching 
from Lancaster to Northridge. Six of the injured went to Henry Mayo Newhall, 11 
to Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, four to Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center and six to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The crashes marked the state's second major fog-related chain-reaction pileup 
this year. On Jan. 15, in a series of eight rapid-fire accidents, more than 70 
vehicles piled into each other on California 99 between Livingston and Selma, 
killing two people and injuring more than 60. 
</P>
<P>
 The pileups near Gorman were not the only accidents on Interstate 5 on 
Wednesday. Stretching back to the Kern County line were a series of seven 
accidents in which four people were injured, Savage said.

AT LEAST 30 DIE, DOZENS ARE INJURED IN FIERY VENEZUELAN BUS CRASH

 A passenger bus slammed into another on a mountain highway Wednesday and 
shoved it into an oil pipeline that exploded. At least 30 people were killed in 
the inferno, and dozens were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The toll could go higher. Most of the dead were on the stricken bus, which 
listed about 50 passengers. Rescue workers who cut the roof off to get inside 
found the passengers burned beyond recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were screaming desperately," one survivor, Alberto Restan, 29, said at 
a hospital. "I saved myself by a miracle. I jumped out a window." Moments 
later, the bus blew up. "When the bus exploded, there was no more screaming." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the government and the bus company said three buses -- all 
traveling from Caracas to Maturin -- were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The first bus apparently broke down and stopped along the national highway 
about 19 miles west of this state capital, which is about 300 miles southeast 
of Caracas. 
</P>
<P>
 A second bus came along and stopped, offering assistance. Then a third bus, 
traveling at high speed, hit the first bus from behind, sending it careening 
into the fuel pipe, Transport Ministry and Civil Defense officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were all from the first two buses.

REBEL MUSLIM IS SAID TO OK TRUCE IN NORTHERN BOSNIA; BALKANS: TOP U.N. 
COMMANDER IN REPUBLIC REPORTEDLY OBTAINS PLEDGE. BIHAC FIGHTING THREATENED 
GOVERNMENT PARTICIPATION IN FURTHER PEACE TALKS.

 The top U.N. commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina apparently won agreement from a 
rebel Muslim leader Wednesday to halt clashes in the northern enclave of Bihac 
that threatened to derail the country's current cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Michael Rose flew to Bihac to meet with Muslim rebel leader Fikret 
Abdic and with the commander of Bosnian government troops in an urgent bid to 
save the cease-fire brokered by former President Jimmy Carter between the 
government and Serbian nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abdic verbally agreed to abide by the cease-fire," U.N. spokesman Alex Ivanko 
said by telephone from the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government had threatened to boycott negotiations on a further 
four-month cessation of hostilities unless the United Nations put a stop to 
attacks by renegade Muslims and neighboring Croatian Serbs in Bihac, a 
U.N.-designated "safe area." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdic and his followers are seeking regional autonomy in the Bihac pocket, 
which borders territory in Croatia held by Croatian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose tried to meet with the Croatian Serbs at their headquarters in Knin, but 
bad weather prevented his helicopter from landing, Ivanko said. He is scheduled 
to try again Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the U.N. spokesman in Zagreb, Thant Myint-U, said the cease-fire 
that went into effect on Christmas Eve in Bosnia-Herzegovina was "still 
essentially holding" and that fighting throughout the country had nearly ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are cautiously optimistic that the cease-fire will continue, though the 
past history of cease-fires in Bosnia-Herzegovina should serve to temper that 
optimism at least to some extent," Thant said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the broader, four-month cessation of hostilities that the government 
and Bosnian Serbs are negotiating would include the release of prisoners, the 
insertion of U.N. forces between the warring factions and the establishment of 
demilitarized areas. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement would be a steppingstone to negotiations for an end to the war 
in the former Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Abdic initially balked at signing a three-paragraph written agreement 
to respect the cease-fire when he met with Rose early in the day, he later 
telephoned the U.N. commander and "there was a verbal assurance from Abdic that 
he will abide by the cease-fire," Ivanko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Croatian Serb soldiers refused to even allow Rose into the 
Bihac area to visit 1,200 Bangladeshi peacekeepers who have been cut off from 
regular supply convoys by Serbian forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government army commander in the region, Gen. Atif Dudakovic, 
referred Rose to his superiors in Sarajevo, where Rose returned Wednesday 
night.

ARAFAT SAYS ISRAELI SETTLEMENT VIOLATES PEACE PACT; MIDEAST: THE PLO CHAIRMAN 
DEMANDS THAT BUILDING OF HOMES FOR SETTLERS ON A WEST BANK HILLTOP BE STOPPED. 
</P>

 A fight between Palestinian villagers and Jewish settlers over a rocky West 
Bank hilltop grew into a full-blown crisis Wednesday between Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat demanded that work be halted immediately on the 
disputed land, which lies on the outskirts of El Khader village, south of 
Bethlehem. Arafat's call was echoed by Cabinet ministers from Meretz, the 
left-wing bloc in Israel's coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat appealed to Western governments to intervene, sending a letter to 
consulates accusing Israel of violating the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement he issued condemning the ongoing construction of Israeli 
settlements in the West Bank, Arafat warned that "such a policy will only widen 
the gap between both peoples. It will not serve the peace process but deals it 
a severe blow, putting it in real danger." 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-hour emergency session Wednesday night, the Palestinian 
Authority issued a statement saying that the settlement activity near El Khader 
violates the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord and must be stopped. In the 
statement, the authority demanded that Israel stop enlarging settlements in the 
West Bank, but it did not say what action it will take if settlement activity 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, soldiers dragged and pushed about 200 Palestinian demonstrators 
from the hilltop, after settlers uprooted olive tree saplings the villagers had 
planted to protest the project. Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian Authority's 
minister of municipal affairs, was kicked and punched by soldiers during the 
clash. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulldozers continued to clear the site Wednesday under the armed guard of 
dozens of Israeli soldiers. Villagers watched the work from a distance, 
chanting nationalist songs and waving the Palestinian flag. As night fell, 
hundreds of villagers built campfires and pitched tents, determined to sleep on 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israeli government is digging the foundation for a new settlement and, at 
the same time, digging a grave for the whole peace process," said authority 
Minister of Information Yasser Abed-Rabbo, who visited the disputed site 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Meretz members urged Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin to immediately halt construction. Environment Minister Yossi 
Sarid and Minister of Culture and Communications Shulamit Aloni said the 
planned settlement posed a threat to the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 But Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the Likud opposition bloc, blasted the 
government for even considering a halt to construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have here is a humiliating bowing before a PLO dictate," Netanyahu 
told Israel Radio. "Because 20 Arabs laid flat on the ground and Arafat lifted 
a finger, the government has to lay flat like a rug?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin asked for a review of the legal status of the property, where the 
settlement of Efrat wants to build a 500-home neighborhood. The report will be 
presented to the Cabinet on Monday, said Oded Ben-Ami, Rabin's spokesman. 
Ben-Ami said construction will continue at the site until then. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Shimon Peres telephoned Arafat on Wednesday in an effort to 
defuse the crisis, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel Shek. Shek denied 
press reports that Peres promised Arafat that construction would be halted 
during the review. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Efrat expressed confidence Wednesday that the project will be 
proved legal and that work will proceed. "Let them take it to the Supreme 
Court," said Menachem Spitz, a member of the Efrat municipal council. "We have 
all the documents to prove ownership." 
</P>
<P>
 Spitz noted that the planned construction is funded privately and will use no 
state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis first declared part of the site to be state land -- meaning that 
it has no owner -- in 1983. The land was turned over to Efrat in 1993. 
Villagers insist that the hilltop belongs to El Khader, and that it is the only 
hilltop available to the village for building homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Efrat is one of the more successful Jewish settlements in the West Bank. 
Within easy driving distance of Jerusalem, the settlement is spread across a 
string of hilltops. A planned community, it boasts luxurious villas, townhomes 
and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of its residents are immigrants, professionals from North America and 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Spitz said there are already 500 families waiting to move to the site.

MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, REBELS MAKE PEACE MOVES; LATIN AMERICA: CHIAPAS GUERRILLAS 
SAY THEY WILL RETURN TO BARGAINING TABLE. IN TURN, THE ARMY WILL WITHDRAW FROM 
KEY TOWNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Breaking a week of trauma, tension and fear, Mexico appeared on the path 
toward peace Wednesday, after Indian rebels agreed to negotiate through an 
official Roman Catholic mediator and President Ernesto Zedillo ordered the army 
to withdraw from two key towns in the southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The concessions by the Zapatista National Liberation Army and the government 
came amid escalating threats of guerrilla war in advance of the first 
anniversary of the rebels' New Year's Day uprising, which left at least 145 
people dead in 12 days of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first statement since declaring an 11-month truce void and deploying 
hundreds of armed fighters throughout the state, rebel leader Subcommander 
Marcos "saluted" Zedillo's government for naming a commission headed by Chiapas 
Bishop Samuel Ruiz to mediate the conflict. Marcos also accepted Zedillo's 
trusted Interior minister, Esteban Moctezuma Barragan, as government 
negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Marcos' statement, made in a letter dated Christmas Day but 
released by the church late Tuesday night, Zedillo said that the Mexican army, 
which has sent a huge force of armor, artillery and troops to Chiapas in recent 
days, was withdrawing from the towns of San Quintin and Monte Libano. Both 
border the Lacandon rain forest, which is the Zapatistas' remote stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is another example of the willingness of President Zedillo to find paths 
to build a just and lasting peace," the Interior Ministry said in a midnight 
communique reacting to Marcos' new willingness to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos' silence in the week after his armed, masked fighters seized dozens of 
villages and blockaded eight major highways in the state on Dec. 19 fueled an 
economic disaster that drove the Mexican peso into a tailspin and shattered 
confidence in Zedillo's month-old government. 
</P>
<P>
 With the loss of an additional 10% of its value at the close of trading 
Tuesday, the peso had lost a total of nearly 40% of its value in a single week 
after Zedillo, blaming the Zapatistas for a "climate of uncertainty," stopped 
defending the currency. The move was intended to arrest a sharp decline in the 
nation's stock market and make Mexico's export industries more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 On news of the peace moves in Chiapas and the pending arrival in Mexico City 
of a team of economists from the International Monetary Fund, the peso rallied 
somewhat Wednesday, closing about 10% higher than a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But most analysts said the markets were waiting for public declarations from 
Zedillo, a Yale-educated economist, on how his government will deal with the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mexico approached another key Jan. 1 anniversary -- the day the North 
American Free Trade Agreement took effect -- sources said Zedillo on Monday 
will make his first public comments on the fall of the peso. The speech will be 
a major economic address, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatista agreement to return to the bargaining table after several months 
of deepening mistrust on both sides could help stabilize the currency and 
restore some confidence in the national economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations have been suspended for months, since before the elections in 
August that brought Zedillo to power along with a governor in Chiapas who the 
rebels insist won through fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Government sources said they were encouraged by the fact that Marcos' letter 
made no mention of earlier Zapatista demands that Gov. Eduardo Robledo Rincon 
resign and that Mexico City recognize a parallel, self-declared "government in 
rebellion" headed by opposition candidate Amado Avendano. 
</P>
<P>
 Avendano, a lawyer, journalist and social activist who sympathizes with the 
rebels' demands for sweeping democratic reform and equal rights for indigenous 
Mexicans, is likely to play a key role in the new round of peace talks with the 
Zapatistas. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly dramatic, Mexican political analysts said, was the timing of the 
joint concessions late Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not a single shot has been fired by either the army or the Zapatistas 
since they agreed to a cease-fire Jan. 12, the massive army deployment this 
week in a state where hundreds of armed guerrillas were positioned on 
mountainsides led many to fear a resurgence of fighting timed to coincide with 
the Zapatistas' New Year's anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 After an evening meeting that lasted nearly four hours before the concessions 
were announced, Bishop Ruiz's National Intermediation Commission said that the 
army deployments had pushed the state to the brink of war. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a statement issued just an hour before Marcos' concessions were made 
public, the commission declared, "We express our readiness to cooperate with 
any alternatives that will bring the peace that Mexican society so desires."

JUDGE RULES PAULA JONES SUIT WILL HAVE TO WAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a split decision involving a potentially explosive sexual harassment 
lawsuit against the President, a federal judge in Little Rock, Ark., agreed 
Wednesday to delay a trial in the case until after Bill Clinton leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge also gave lawyers permission to question Clinton and others 
under oath about Paula Corbin Jones' claim that Clinton, while governor of 
Arkansas, made crude sexual advances to her in a Little Rock hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 Those sworn statements about the case, if made public or leaked to the press, 
could embarrass and damage the already embattled President prior to the 1996 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's high-profile lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, has sought to get the case 
thrown out of court, or at least to have it put on hold indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett's office said he was out of the country Wednesday and was unavailable 
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carl S. Rauh, an attorney working with Bennett, said they would appeal the 
judge's ruling that allows the discovery process to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned about this being a distraction for the President," Rauh 
said. Experts familiar with sexual harassment cases said that the depositions 
involving Clinton and others who witnessed his alleged actions could prove 
embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
 They predicted that Bennett would probably seek a court order sealing all the 
depositions. They could also delay matters further by successivly appealing 
Wednesday's ruling to a higher court. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for Jones said that he was "gratified" by the 22-page opinion issued 
by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court has agreed with our position that the President does not enjoy 
immunity from these kinds of lawsuits," said Joseph Cammarata of Fairfax, Va. 
"We have a lot of people to depose, and the court has said, 'Let's get the 
process going.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling cuts a middle course in addressing the previously unresolved 
question of whether a sitting President can be dragged into court to fight a 
damage suit involving a private matter. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, the Supreme Court gave the President "absolute immunity" from being 
sued over his "official actions." 
</P>
<P>
 But the justices have not spoken on claims involving the President's private 
conduct or matters that took place before he was elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a low-level Arkansas state employee, said she was escorted to meet the 
governor in his hotel room on May 8, 1991, about 18 months before Clinton was 
elected President. 
</P>
<P>
 But she waited until May 6, 1994, to file a damage suit against him -- in 
hopes, she said, of clearing her name over rumors that she had been intimately 
involved with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the lawsuit, Bennett claimed the President was entitled to 
absolute immunity from such damage claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Wright, an appointee of former President George Bush, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one, be he a king or a President, is above the law," she wrote in the 
opinion. However, the chief executive is due a "temporary or limited immunity" 
from undergoing a trial during his term of office, she added, because it would 
inevitably distract him from his official duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although President Clinton is not entitled to have this action dismissed on 
the basis of immunity, he should not have to devote his time and effort to the 
defense of this case at trial while in office," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The preparation for a trial can move forward, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There would seem to be no reason why the discovery and deposition process 
could not proceed as to all persons, including the President himself," she 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 State trooper Danny Ferguson remains a key figure in the case. Jones also sued 
Ferguson because he allegedly escorted her to the hotel room. On Wednesday, 
Wright said the two suits are so intertwined that they must proceed together. 
</P>
<P>
 This clears the way for Ferguson to be questioned under oath about whether he 
indeed took the young woman to meet Clinton in his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 The trooper's attorney, Bill Britsow of Jonesboro, Ark., did not return calls 
seeking comment on the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Zachary Fasman, a Washington lawyer who handles job discrimination cases, said 
the judge's ruling allowing discovery to proceed is a big victory for Jones and 
poses a potential problem for the President.

 "I would assume they (Clinton's lawyers) will seek a protective order keeping 
these depositions under seal. This a sensitive case and judges usually grant 
those orders," he said. "But the problem is that those orders are hard to 
enforce. You can try to seal it, but it doesn't always work."

GLICKMAN CHOSEN FOR AGRICULTURE DEPT.; CABINET: KANSAN IS NOMINATED TO RUN HUGE 
AGENCY UNDER PRESSURE TO DOWNSIZE AND REDUCE FARM SUBSIDIES. HE HINTS THAT 
HE'LL RESIST SOME CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton on Wednesday nominated Rep. Dan Glickman to head the 
Department of Agriculture, thrusting the Kansas Democrat into the center of a 
debate over how much to cut an agency that distributes huge farm subsidies but 
has powerful congressional protectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced by Clinton in a Rose Garden ceremony, Glickman acknowledged the 
pressure for further budget reductions at the 130-year-old department, calling 
it "a challenge I welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 "Agriculture is not, and should not, be immune to change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he hinted he would resist some changes, saying: "It is 
important that we not overlook agriculture's many, many successes, its unique 
contributions to our economy and our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Glickman, 50, who was defeated for reelection in November after 18 years in 
the House, will replace Mike Espy, who resigned amid an independent counsel's 
investigation of gifts and other benefits he received from USDA-regulated 
companies. Espy has insisted that he did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-largest federal agency, the Agriculture Department is in the throes 
of a reorganization that is supposed to close one-third of its field offices 
and could trim as much as $3.6 billion from its annual budget. But amid general 
calls for more aggressive government downsizing, many in Congress are pushing 
for a more radical restructuring. Reductions in the agency's $10-billion annual 
farm subsidy program are under serious consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 The nomination, expected to win easy congressional approval, will place 
Glickman squarely between budget-minded reformers and powerful lawmakers who 
want to protect long-sacred farm entitlements. Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), 
is expected to face resistance in his effort to bring about reform -- 
especially from Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and, to some extent, 
Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), the new chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight will be joined when Congress goes to work on a five-year 
reauthorization of omnibus farm legislation that will set federal policy on 
farm subsidies, nutrition and environmental programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The political challenge for Glickman, according to several congressional 
aides, will be to find a way to take part in the reform drive while remaining 
positioned to challenge the Republicans' dedication to reform if -- as many 
expect -- the subsidy-cutting effort stalls. Glickman "has a chance to score 
some points for the Administration," one aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Rose Garden remarks, Clinton said that Glickman, who had high hopes of 
winning the post two years ago, had been a "leading spokesman" for the industry 
in his long service with the House Agriculture Committee and a "key architect" 
of the last four farm bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident that Congressman Glickman will not only carry on the 
innovations begun by Secretary Espy, but break new ground in our efforts to 
increase farm exports and bridge the differences between rural and urban 
members of Congress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pressures on Glickman also were clear, as Lugar told reporters that he 
would press the new secretary for a re-examination of the subsidy program, as 
well as costly federal disaster-relief programs. Lugar said he would press for 
completion of the Agriculture Department reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Lugar said he would ask Glickman to explain in his confirmation hearings why 
the subsidy programs are worthwhile. His own views, Lugar added, "are that we 
should be probably doing much less government subsidy." 
</P>
<P>
 Lugar contended that much remained undone in the Agriculture Department 
downsizing, which is supposed to close 1,274 of the agency's 3,000 field 
offices. "Not much downsizing has occurred, even though large claims have been 
made for savings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Clinton Administration has taken credit for savings, Lugar said, it 
has yet to explain how it would downsize the 125,000-employee agency from 43 to 
29 departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Some congressional aides said it was still unclear how far Glickman would push 
for agency reform, noting that over the years the Kansan has pushed for some 
changes but resisted others. In 1985, for example, he backed a new approach -- 
but not a dismantling -- of the farm supports system. In 1990, he promoted a 
bill to consolidate the Agriculture Department's field offices, and cut its 
paperwork requirements for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's support for Glickman was also important in his selection for the post, 
aides noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Glickman, who has chaired the House Intelligence Committee for the past two 
years, is a Wichita native whose grandfather immigrated from Russia to run a 
scrap metal business. His upset election defeat was caused in large measure, he 
has acknowledged, by the strong anti-Clinton feeling in his home state.

7.5-MAGNITUDE QUAKE IN JAPAN LEAVES 2 DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A strong earthquake struck northern Japan late Wednesday, killing at least two 
people and injuring 233. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears of tidal waves prompted coastal evacuation warnings after the 
7.5-magnitude quake hit at 9:19 p.m., but the warnings were lifted 2 1/2 hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 390 miles northeast of 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people were killed and eight injured when the second floor of a pachinko 
-- a Japanese-style pinball parlor -- collapsed in Hachinohe, a Pacific coast 
city of about 240,000 people 95 miles west of the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people were cut by broken glass or struck by falling objects. Police said 
179 of the injured were in Hachinohe. Most of the injuries were not serious, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shaking was strong. I couldn't stand. I saw many people squatting down on 
the street, and some ran away," said Takashi Masaya, a Hachinohe official. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Meteorological Agency reported a preliminary magnitude of 7.5. The 
U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, 
Colo., measured the quake at 7.4. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 135 aftershocks were reported within nine hours after the quake, 
including one with a preliminary magnitude of 6.2. It was not immediately known 
if they caused further damage or injury. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hachinohe, television news footage showed large cracks in the walls of a 
high school and concrete fragments scattered around. 
</P>
<P>
 Windows broke, furniture toppled and shattered bottles littered floors across 
the region. At least eight houses were damaged, and two landslides were 
reported, police said. Electricity was cut for a time in parts of Hachinohe. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the quake was felt as a long, slow rumbling.

ALGERIAN HIJACKERS' GROUP CLAIMS IT MURDERED PRIESTS 
</P>

<TEXT>

 Algeria's radical Armed Islamic Group on Wednesday took responsibility for the 
slaying of four Catholic priests in Algeria after four of its members were 
slain by French commandos who stormed a hijacked Air France jetliner in 
Marseilles. 
</P>
<P>
 The priests, three Frenchmen and a Belgian, were killed Tuesday, a day after 
commandos rescued 170 hostages and ended the hijacking, which began Saturday in 
Algiers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement faxed to news organizations, the Armed Islamic Group, or GIA, 
said the priests died as part of a campaign of "annihilation and physical 
liquidation of Christian crusaders." 
</P>
<P>
 The French priests were Christian Cheissel, 36, Jean Chevillard, 69, and Alain 
Dieulangard, 75. Charles Deckers, a 70-year-old Belgian, had set up an 
association in Algiers to promote better understanding between Christians and 
Muslims.

WOOLSEY WALKS AWAY AFTER TURNING CIA DOWN ROAD TO CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as he was beginning to rejuvenate the beleaguered Central Intelligence 
Agency, R. James Woolsey is leaving it at perhaps one of its most critical 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's spy network, heralded during the darkest days of the Cold War, 
has been scorched by the espionage scandal involving Aldrich H. Ames and 
humiliated by widespread allegations of sexual harassment and male clubbiness. 
</P>
<P>
 It also faces the political reality of a shrinking budget and a new Republican 
Congress eager to plant its own imprint on the intelligence community in the 
years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey was the first CIA director from the outside to take the helm with the 
stated intent of moving the agency through the changes needed in a post-Cold 
War era. It is a job he will leave unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are tough changes ahead," Woolsey told The Times last month, describing 
the predicament of trying to boost the effectiveness and morale of a secret 
organization that has come sharply under fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to say things in a way that doesn't tell people that their 
institution is worthless and that it's fallen into such disrepute that it can't 
be repaired. So it's kind of a tough line I walk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the trick in all this is in walking the line of convincing people that 
there are some things that need to change, like greater counterintelligence 
awarenesses and less of a clubbish atmosphere. And that it's not true that once 
you're inside the door (at CIA headquarters) that you can be trusted with 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the CIA is under public scrutiny like almost never before. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, Senate and House intelligence committees soon will be chaired 
by Republicans who have their own ideas on making the CIA more accountable to 
the public trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm coming at this from a different perspective," said Rep. Larry Combest 
(R-Tex.), who will head the House Select Committee on Intelligence. "I'm going 
to come at this from a standpoint of how much do we need. I want to define the 
need for intelligence before I define its size. And there's no blank check on 
this anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who will head the Senate intelligence panel, 
promised to be equally vigilant. One of his great concerns is whether the Ames 
spy scandal and the allegations of sexual harassment are an aberration or part 
of deep structural failings inside an agency in serious need of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real dangerous thing, as to whether this is systemic," Specter said. 
"I am prepared to say it's a real worry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has designs of its own on reshaping the 
intelligence apparatus in Washington. A special presidential commission has 
been established and, under the auspices of former Defense Secretary Les Aspin, 
will meet over the next year to draw up recommendations for improving both the 
civilian and military intelligence networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Such former CIA directors as Robert M. Gates and William H. Webster credit 
Woolsey with taking the first steps toward reforming the agency. But they see 
more that needs to be accomplished before real improvements will come about. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, for instance, has made a series of speeches outlining a 10-point plan 
that ranges from creating a separate director of military intelligence to 
halting the large amount of duplication by various government agencies in 
compiling intelligence data. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would consider these to be a menu of changes that would be fairly dramatic 
taken together," Gates said in an interview. "And it would enable the 
government to do a lot of restructuring." 
</P>
<P>
 Webster, while not as specific in his reform proposals, said the Woolsey 
changes and other recommendations he has made should be continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim has moved well down the road in terms of downsizing," Webster said. 
"There's nothing magic about the shape of the agency, as long as it's relevant 
to its time." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Woolsey seemed intent on rehabilitating the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10 weeks between Ames' arrest and the imposition of his life prison 
sentence, Woolsey and his subordinates held a total of 242 meetings with 
members of Congress and their staffs -- in formal committee sessions, in small 
groups and in individual discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 During that same period, intelligence experts advised the White House on such 
issues as North Korea, Russia, Iraq and international organized crime. In 
March, they gave more than 1,300 intelligence briefings to government officials 
here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of an array of steps he hoped would increase effectiveness at CIA 
headquarters in Langley, Va., Woolsey has: 
</P>
<P>
 * Implemented mandatory training for counterintelligence and new procedures 
for coordinating CIA and FBI operations, appointing a special assistant for 
counterintelligence who reports directly to the head of the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drafted new guidelines for CIA managers and created the office of personnel 
security to monitor employee performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brought changes to the agency's bread-and-butter directorate of operations, 
including new employee evaluations and an overhaul of its training program. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Woolsey was remodeling his organization, many of his detractors 
said he was not acting fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
 One constant critic, Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), the outgoing chairman of 
the Senate Intelligence Committee, persistently questioned Woolsey's 
leadership, attacking everything from the size of the budgets he sought to his 
handling of the Ames case. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in Congress were upset that Woolsey's harshest punishments in the Ames 
matter were reprimands for some of Ames' supervisors. They felt stiffer 
penalties were in order if the agency expected to cleanse itself from within. 
They were curious that President Clinton and other Administration officials 
never spoke out publicly about the "moves" Woolsey made after the Ames affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "He moved because events forced him to move," said Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), 
the outgoing chairman of the House intelligence panel. "But when Woolsey meted 
out the punishment, I did not see the National Security Council as an active 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here was the irony of all ironies," Glickman added. "We spent $2 trillion on 
defense in the Cold War, and then along comes the biggest spy scandal in the 
history of America and Woolsey just handles it all on his own. And I think he 
became a little bit of a fall guy because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of the negative attacks on the CIA during the last two years was 
not lost on the rank-and-file members inside the agency. But some observers see 
that as an eventuality for an agency whose fundamental mission requires it to 
operate behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those frustrations are inherent with an agency that deals in secrets," 
Combest said. "You're never going to see a list in the newspaper of all the 
good things they have done." 
</P>
<P>
 At Langley, the news of Woolsey's departure is another blow to some agency 
officials who had thought their director would be on hand to see his changes 
come to fruition. GOVERNMENT OFFICIA

 The new Republican leadership in the House of Representatives has decided to 
abolish the Office of the Historian, a five-person staff founded in 1983, with 
a budget of $337,000. House Speaker Newt Gingrich's office confirmed that it 
was being eliminated, saying the office was only meant to be temporary, for the 
bicentennial of Congress, when Gingrich (R-Ga.) supported it in 1982. 
Transition team staffers said, however, that the House will continue to pay for 
a full-time chaplain who opens each session with a prayer and tends to members' 
spiritual needs.

KING FAMILY EVICTS NATIONAL PARK SERVICE; HISTORIC SITE: RELATIVES ALLEGE 
DECEIT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE BITTER CONFLICT OVER PLANS FOR 
BIRTHPLACE, TOMB HAS SPLIT THE BLACK COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Accusing the National Park Service of trying to usurp an important piece of 
black history, the family of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. banished the agency 
from the King birthplace and tomb Wednesday, escalating a conflict that has 
split the African American community and threatens the future of one of the 
city's biggest tourist draws. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the dispute is a Park Service plan to build an $11.8-million 
visitor center, parking facilities and a pedestrian promenade to accommodate 
the 5 million tourists that are expected to visit King's crypt in 1996 when 
Atlanta hosts the Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The King family is eyeing the same site -- across the street from the 
family-owned and operated King Center for Nonviolent Social Change -- to build 
its own high-tech, interactive, virtual reality center to commemorate the slain 
civil rights figure. 
</P>
<P>
 The family is also seeking a larger share of federal funds that go to maintain 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are witnessing . . . is a classic encroachment and annexation of a 
people and their history by the federal government," said Dexter King, son of 
the civil rights leader and president-elect of the King Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The National Park Service was invited into this community and district by my 
mother Coretta Scott King to be a tour guide for the Martin Luther King birth 
home and serve in a support role to the King Center's programs, vision and 
purpose," he said. "They began as a tour guide but have become landlords." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Dexter King said, the King Center will operate its own tours of 
the birth home. Complying with the family's wishes, the Park Service said that 
beginning today it would conduct tours of the King birth home without venturing 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Lissimore, the Park Service superintendent of the historic site, said 
park rangers would maintain a presence in the historic site and would continue 
with ambitious construction plans in the area. "We will not leave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute has divided Atlanta's black community. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued through the office of Mayor Bill Campbell on Wednesday said 
the King Center "did not meaningfully participate" in the Park Service's 
two-year planning process and shouldn't seek changes now. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Dec. 18 column, Atlanta Journal-Constitution editorial page editor 
Cynthia Tucker called the King family's proposed virtual reality center "a sort 
of I Have a Dreamland, to make a profit from a Disneyesque trip through the 
civil rights movement." 
</P>
<P>
 That brought a rebuke last week from Coretta Scott King, who said, "The same 
evil forces that destroyed Martin Luther King are now trying to destroy my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Dexter King on Wednesday denied accusations that the family was motivated by 
profit.

 "The National Park Service has pitted neighbor against neighbor, leader 
against leader, in the African American community. For this I am saddened," he 
said. "I haven't taken office yet as chairman and CEO of the King Center and 
already I stand on the opposite side of the community leaders who I grew up 
(respecting)." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3 million people visit the historic site yearly. Included in the 
23-acre area are King's crypt, his birth home, the church he pastored and the 
family-run King Center that opened in 1980 to preserve his legacy and advance 
his social goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Service took over operation of the historic site in 1983. The Park 
Service paid $500,000 a year to the King Center to conduct the tours, said 
spokesman Paul Winegar, but that contract expired in September after the King 
Center sought to triple the fee to $1.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its plans for a visitor center, the Park Service has arranged 
to lease the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King and his father had been 
pastors. It would operate the church as a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a new $7-million church is being planned next to the visitor 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism of the King family for its actions has been intense. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Auburn Avenue Rib Shack, three blocks west of the King Center, owner 
Dorothy Clements just shook her head as she discussed the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is making a mistake," she said of Coretta Scott King's plans for an 
interactive museum. "What kind of legacy is that for Dr. King's memory. That's 
a circus. We don't want a circus down here. That's not representing anything 
Dr. King stands for. To make money off of him. She's been getting a half 
million from the government. Now she wants to turn around and charge people to 
come to a museum. That's greed." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Hickman, who was sitting on a stool at the Rib Shack, said King "cut her 
nose off and shot herself in the foot at the same time" when she gave an 
ultimatum to the Park Service. "She doesn't know what compromise means." 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists flocked to the center Wednesday as workers prepared for next month's 
celebration of the federal holiday honoring King's birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something people all over the world should come and visit," said 
James Martin Jr., assistant football coach at South Carolina State University 
who visited the center with his players. "I really hope the King Center and 
Park Service can come together. That's what everybody would want."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; MONTEBELLO RECEIVES FUNDS IN EFFORT TO AVOID 
DEFAULT; DEBTS: CITY GETS $14 MILLION TOWARD NOTE PAYMENT OF $25.6 MILLION DUE 
FRIDAY. IT WILL TRY TO WORK OUT A PLAN TO COVER THE REST.

 The beleaguered city of Montebello received a $14-million infusion Wednesday 
from the bankrupt Orange County investment pool, clearing a major hurdle in the 
city's effort to ease a financial crisis spawned by its investments in the 
county fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The payment, which was approved by two creditors committees and the county's 
bankruptcy attorneys, was a key part of the city's plan to avoid defaulting on 
a $25.6-million note payment due Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello officials had borrowed heavily this year to invest in the Orange 
County pool in anticipation of earning more money. The city planned to pull 
money out of the pool to pay off the $25.6-million note, but it was left in the 
lurch when the investment pool plunged in value early this month. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have been working feverishly to put together a plan to meet the 
Friday deadline. Most of the $14 million is expected to be paid to seven 
unidentified institutional investors who provided the original loan in June. 
The investors have tentatively agreed to give the city more time to repay the 
remaining $11.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Richard Torres said Wednesday he was optimistic that the 
deal can be pulled together by Friday. "We've averted a default," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres and the City Council met late Wednesday in closed session to discuss 
details of their plan to repay investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres acknowledged that the city still faces several financial hurdles. The 
city, for example, will face a new deadline on the remaining $11.5-million 
debt, plus interest. The city also has a September, 1995, deadline for paying 
another $6 million it borrowed to invest in the Orange County pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also will have to wrestle with the loss of an estimated $1.9 million 
in interest that officials had expected to receive from the city's investment 
in the pool this year. The anticipated interest had been included in the city's 
$32-million budget this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello, a suburb of 60,000 that some residents like to call "the Beverly 
Hills of East Los Angeles," first invested $7.8 million in 1991 in the Orange 
County pool, which was paying the highest interest around and was considered 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the city invested $47 million in the Orange County fund, including 
$31 million that the city had borrowed at low interest rates and put into the 
pool in anticipation of greater gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said he is confident that the city can pay its bills, but the 
uncertainty over the Dec. 30 debt payment led Standard & Poor's Corp. to lower 
its rating earlier this month on two outstanding notes -- the $25.6 million due 
Friday and $6 million due next September.

SHOOTINGS SHAKE UP TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD; CRIME: RESIDENTS SAY THEY'RE USED TO THE 
SOUND OF GUNSHOTS. BUT TWO HOLIDAY ATTACKS, ONE FATAL, HAVE SOME DRAWING THE 
LINE. 
</P>

 Longtime residents of Rene Drive have grown accustomed to the sound of 
gunshots ricocheting off fences in this working-class neighborhood. But two 
shootings over the Christmas weekend, one of them fatal, have prompted some to 
consider moving away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rare when a day goes by and you don't hear gunshots, but we've never 
heard them so close to our home like it happened Monday," said an 18-year 
resident who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. "It's getting 
pretty scary -- we might sell the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Drive, off Edinger Avenue and Bristol Street, is made up of single-story 
houses, some guarded by wrought-iron fences, others enclosed by simple 
chain-link fences. And though graffiti is not rampant, it can be found scrawled 
on chimneys and paint-cracked walls along parts of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, Rene Fernandez, a 19-year-old student at Orange Coast College, 
was shot in the upper torso and died at the scene on Carlton Place, just a few 
blocks away from Rene Drive, where he had lived for most of his life. Police 
said Fernandez and his two friends were shot at by unknown assailants as the 
three drove to a friend's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The two friends, who were wounded in the shooting, were treated at a local 
hospital and later released. No arrests have been made, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Monday morning, five Inglewood men on their way to a party were shot at 
by unknown assailants who stopped the victims as they drove by on Rene Drive, 
police said. One of the victims, Sergio Jaime, 21, was seriously wounded and 
remained on a life-support system at UCI Medical Center in Orange. No arrests 
have been made in that shooting either, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gunshots are very common -- I hear them every other night," said Salvador 
Enriquez, 19, a student at Rancho Santiago College and a Rene Drive resident. 
"The way I see it, it will take just a couple more years and this neighborhood 
will be like my old one, and that one was real bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the residents in the neighborhood say they feel safe during the day. 
It's at night that they don't dare venture onto the streets of their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our neighborhood is not bad and it generally feels safe," said 16-year-old 
Brenda Guillen, a sophomore at Century High School. "But I feel scared about 
the shootings. That's why I lay low at night and stay home with the doors 
locked." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said they have been robbed in broad daylight. Recently, Amelia Perales, 
44, had a gold chain snatched off her neck as she walked to pick up her 
children from school on nearby McFadden Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Perales, who has lived in the neighborhood for eight years, said her house was 
burglarized a few years ago. She said she and her husband tried to sell the 
house last year, but received no offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will try to sell the house again this year because we want to move into a 
better neighborhood," said Perales, who has five children. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents attribute the rise in crime to the proximity of their neighborhood 
to Bristol Street, which has become a gathering spot for weekend cruising. 
Cruisers often make U-turns on Rene Drive, but some also park their lowriders 
on the street and cause trouble, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime in the neighborhood, however, is not a significant problem, said Lt. 
Robert Helton, a spokesman for the Police Department. Helton added that 
officers do not see a link between crime on Rene Drive and cruising on Bristol 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a sense of fear that the general population has, but it is not 
founded on anything they can specifically cite," he said. "It's unfortunate 
that just hearing a gunshot is a sign to them to stay home at night." 
</P>
<P>
 But residents insist that cruising has contributed to crime in their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cruisers are a big problem, plus the tagging and the gangs," said Eva 
Fernandez, whose son, Rene, was shot to death Christmas Eve. "A friend of mine 
who lives nearby on the corner of Pacific and Edinger is selling her house 
because of all the cruising and shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Fernandez, who has lived in the neighborhood for 14 years, said she 
has never considered moving, not even after last weekend's tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to move -- all of my relatives are here in Santa Ana and we need 
a lot of emotional support from them right now," she said. "That is the only 
reason we are staying."

SECOND PARENTHOOD; MORE GRANDPARENTS FACE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HAVING TO RAISE 
THEIR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Like a lot of people in their late 50s and early 60s, Joan and Jerry McMillin 
had a retirement plan: Travel the country in a camper, grow old with friends, 
put some money aside for their grandchildren's education. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, those plans evaporated when their daughter was stabbed to death 
by her husband in front of their two children in an Orange County motel room. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the McMillins are parents again, raising grandchildren George, 11, and 
Audrey, 10, in a white bungalow in Bellflower after a five-year custody battle 
that exhausted their life savings and left them in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither of us wanted to do this," Joan McMillin said. "We had a beautiful 
picture in front of us that we were moving toward. But the glass broke, and the 
picture was destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 The McMillins are among a growing number of grandparents thrust into the job 
of raising children for a second time, missing out on long-awaited retirements. 
According to census data, in 1990 three times as many grandparents were raising 
their grandchildren as in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to the McMillins was an extreme case; more often, grandparents 
assume child-rearing roles while their own children deal with drug addictions, 
spousal abuse, divorce or financial pressures that limit the time they can 
devote to parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of support groups have formed throughout the United States to help 
grandparents such as the McMillins cope with the financial, physical and 
emotional demands of raising children. One of the country's first groups -- 
Grandparents as Parents -- started in Long Beach eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The McMillins say they found kinship and solace at the weekly meetings. The 
organization brought in experts in family law, the social welfare bureaucracy 
and financial matters to give grandparents advice. At picnics, holiday parties 
and counseling sessions, grandparent members shared information -- from cooking 
tips and child-rearing strategies to horror stories about battling their own 
children for custody of the grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The McMillins met a retired Los Angeles nurse with colon cancer who is raising 
five grandchildren, all born addicted to drugs. They met a couple from Lakewood 
who have been battling for custody of an 8-year-old grandson abandoned at birth 
by his drug-addicted mother. Another member of the group, a single grandmother, 
had won custody of her grandson from his drug-addicted, abusive mother, only to 
learn that the boy's father, who is in prison for attempted murder, might gain 
custody when he is released in a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grandparents also learn to cope with guilt stemming from their own children's 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned we weren't bad parents, and we're not failures," Joan McMillin 
said. "Some of the guilt was lifted, and we could go on." 
</P>
<P>
 A beautician, the 58-year-old appears to be flourishing in her role as mom. On 
a recent afternoon, the aroma of chicken soup wafts from the kitchen where she 
is standing in front of a pot, stirring. Jerry McMillin, 60, a former 
refrigerator repairman, sits in an armchair in the living room, overseeing 
George Gallagher Jr. and Audrey Gallagher as they do math homework.  
</P>
<P>
 On the living room wall is a portrait of their mother, Barbara. She looks 
radiant, youthful, her head cocked, her smile self-assured. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture is deceiving, though. Barbara's life was never as easy as the 
photograph suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara was the youngest of Joan McMillin's seven children. When Barbara was 
still a baby, McMillin left her abusive first husband in Massachusetts, packed 
the kids in the car and drove to California. She moved to Bellflower in 1970, 
working at odd jobs to keep food on the table. She went back to school but 
continued to work nights and weekends. She often had to leave Barbara in the 
care of the older children. Joan met Jerry, a divorced father of three grown 
children, in the late 1970s. They married a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara met George Gallagher when she was 14. He was 20, with the looks of a 
TV anchor, and had a well-paying aerospace factory job. Almost immediately, 
Barbara became pregnant. In 1983, at age 17, she was married and the mother of 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
 During the marriage, Gallagher drank, smoked marijuana and beat Barbara, 
according to Joan and Jerry McMillin. The two children lived on and off with 
their grandparents.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1986, Barbara and George divorced and the court gave custody of 
the children to Barbara. But Barbara kept returning to George, despite the 
pleas of Joan and Jerry McMillin to leave him for good.  
</P>
<P>
 Barbara exhibited the classic symptoms of a battered woman, said Sylvie de 
Toledo, a licensed clinical social worker who founded Grandparents as Parents 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow the man still has a lot of power and control," de Toledo said. "When 
there are children involved, and you're dependent on an abusive man emotionally 
and financially, it's very hard to break away because you're wondering how 
you're going to survive."  
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1988, Barbara, George and the children moved into the Twin Cypress 
Motel in Orange. One day six months later, Audrey and George Jr. were helping 
pack the car for a trip to the beach. Their parents started arguing about 
money. George Gallagher pulled out a knife and stabbed his wife repeatedly in 
the head. Audrey was 4 at the time. George Jr. was 5. 
</P>
<P>
 George put the children in the car and went to his mother's house in Yorba 
Linda. In front of Audrey, he stabbed his sister Mary in the chest, killing 
her. He put the kids in the car again, drove onto the Costa Mesa Freeway and 
crashed into the center divider. He left the kids, who were uninjured, took off 
his clothes and ran naked through a nearby neighborhood, where he was arrested 
without a struggle.  
</P>
<P>
 After a two-day trial, a Superior Court judge ruled that Gallagher was insane 
when he stabbed his wife but was sane when he stabbed his sister. Gallagher was 
ordered confined to a state mental hospital, where he remains. Even if he is 
declared sane in the future, however, Gallagher will face a prison sentence of 
26 years to life in the death of his sister. After Gallagher's trial, Joan 
McMillin told a reporter: "Now I know there's a safe future for our family and 
my grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 But their problems were far from over. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the McMillins' objections, Orange County social workers placed the 
children with Gallagher's teen-age sister. A few months later, the McMillins 
won temporary custody of George Jr. and Audrey, but George Gallagher's mother 
and brother sued for permanent custody. 
</P>
<P>
 There followed a five-year battle in Orange County Juvenile Court involving 
the McMillins, George Gallagher's family and social workers. Although the 
children remained with the McMillins, a series of hearings were held to 
determine whether they would be suitable parents, and to determine how the 
children were adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At various times, Joan McMillin said, she was blamed by some social workers 
and the Gallagher family for her daughter's death and denounced as a bad mother 
and grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stress was horrible," McMillin said. "I couldn't eat or sleep. You start 
even wondering about yourself. Maybe they're right, maybe you're wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are not a problem," she said. "I can do 10 kids. I roller-skate, I 
ride bikes, I do all that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the custody battle that took its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Jerry McMillin suffered three strokes, causing mild brain damage that 
forced him to give up his successful refrigerator-repair business.  
</P>
<P>
 The McMillins now live on Social Security and what Joan McMillin earns from 
three part-time jobs: cosmetologist, demonstrator of grocery store products on 
weekends, seasonal worker in a marmalade factory. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, who were aware that a court might force them to leave the 
McMillins, also were having problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey talked like a baby. She lay on the sofa in the fetal position. She wet 
the bed every night. She forgot how to read and write and had to repeat 
kindergarten. For a time, she refused to go to bed unless the windows and doors 
were covered with blankets. She kept saying she was afraid that "daddy would 
come get me," according to Joan McMillin. 
</P>
<P>
 She said George Jr. "would get angry and throw and break things. He would hit 
Audrey and she would hit him. When I tried to get him to talk to me, he would 
say, 'Why can't we just live with you? Why do we have to go to court? Maybe 
they're going to send us away.' "It was very hard to convince this little boy 
that he was going to stay with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, neither Joan nor Jerry ever considered giving up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to do what I thought was right, to stand by my wife and take care of 
the kids," Jerry said. "I promised the kids I'd be as good a father as I could. 
When I make a commitment, I do my best to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 Court Commissioner Gale Hickman said the case dragged on partly because he was 
concerned whether the McMillins were up to the task of raising children who had 
experienced such trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who had the kids, including the McMillins, would have a difficult task 
raising them," Hickman said. "I never had any doubt about the McMillins' energy 
and willpower but (doubted) whether they had whatever it might take to cope 
with these kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have thought that about anybody," Hickman said. "These kids were very 
disrupted." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Hickman ruled that the McMillins should have permanent custody of 
George and Audrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking the bond between the McMillins and their grandchildren might cause 
George and Audrey irreparable damage, the commissioner decided. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens to kids who . . . have bonded only to have the bond destroyed? 
They stop trusting," he said. "And when they stop trusting, they get angry and 
they carry their anger around. It disrupts them forever and ever." 
</P>
<P>
 In the year since the McMillins were awarded permanent custody and the court 
terminated its monitoring, George and Audrey "have done 10 times better in 
attitude, in feeling secure, in school, than they had in the previous six 
years," Joan McMillin said. "They're calm, they're happy, their lives turned 
right around."

MERGER PLANS LEAVE STAFF OF CLINIC STUNNED; HEALTH CARE: LAGUNA BEACH 
FACILITY'S EMPLOYEES WANTED TO BE LINKED WITH UCI MEDICAL CENTER. INSTEAD, 
PROPOSAL IS FOR IT TO BE JOINED WITH SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO OPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who run the Laguna Beach Community Clinic said Wednesday they are 
stunned and dismayed that their board of directors has voted without consulting 
with them or the community on a proposal to merge with South County Community 
Clinic in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Lithgow, a family nurse practitioner who coordinates the Laguna Beach 
clinic's medical services, said the board of directors informed the staff by a 
faxed message on Dec. 20 that the merger was in the offing and that they would 
receive more information next Wednesday, when board members return from holiday 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff members "stood with their mouths open and some were crying," Lithgow 
said. The next day they shot back a letter of objection to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter acknowledged the need for the Laguna Beach clinic to affiliate with 
other health providers to meet the new full-service requirements of OPTIMA, the 
county's emerging managed-care program for Medi-Cal recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 But the letter, which Lithgow said was signed by 24 staff members, said the 
staff had anticipated that the Laguna Beach clinic would merge with UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, with which it already has "a strong and healthy referral 
relationship," rather than with another nonprofit community clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Birtcher, a developer who chairs the South County Community Clinic and 
serves on the OPTIMA board of directors, said any affiliation between the two 
clinics is still tentative and would hinge upon a feasibility study. "The only 
advantage is if we could bring stronger management and financial sources," he 
said, noting that the San Juan Capistrano clinic is "one of the more 
financially stable clinics in Orange County." He called the proposal an 
affiliation rather than a merger or takeover.  
</P>
<P>
 Joan Cobin, the Laguna Beach clinic's executive director, said an underlying 
concern of the staff involves the San Juan Capistrano clinic's close working 
relationship with Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. 
Mission Hospital recently merged with St. Joseph Health System, which is owned 
and operated by Catholic nuns, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobin said her staff fears that the Catholic Church's philosophical opposition 
to birth control could adversely impact the Laguna Beach clinic's family 
planning service. 
</P>
<P>
 If Laguna Beach Community Clinic affiliated with UCI, while the San Juan 
Capistrano clinic was linked with St. Joseph Health System, Cobin argues, the 
poor of south Orange County would have a choice of hospitals and philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, she said, the staff of the Laguna Beach clinic wanted the advantages 
of joining with an educational hospital, such as UCI, that could assign medical 
students and resident physicians to work at the clinic.  
</P>
<P>
 Cobin said she believes the Laguna Beach community and the staff of the local 
clinic should have had an opportunity to voice their opinions before the 
clinic's board voted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are going to change a 25-year-old institution, they should have 
consulted the community and the staff should have somehow been brought into 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Piccione, executive director of UCI Medical Center, said the hospital's 
representatives had been discussing a possible affiliation with the Laguna 
Beach clinic for at least two months. She said she believed it would have been 
a good opportunity for the clinic because of UCI's "long history of supporting 
the Medi-Cal population." 
</P>
<P>
 Two members of the Laguna Beach clinic's board of directors, Maureen La Bonte 
and board President Gwen Barry, refused to publicly comment on the proposed 
merger until Wednesday's meeting with the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. George Kallins, a Mission Viejo physician and member of the Laguna Beach 
clinic board, said: "The staff is biased and doesn't understand what is best 
for them. They haven't been properly informed." 
</P>
<P>
 Kallins said if the clinics merge, they will be governed by a single board of 
directors and executive director. It is uncertain, he said, whether the name of 
the clinic would change. He denied that the clinic's family planning service 
would be harmed, noting that any health system that contracts with OPTIMA must 
provide all such Medi-Cal approved services. 
</P>
<P>
 Kallins said the Laguna Beach clinic is financially troubled and would benefit 
from the South County Community Clinic's superior financial management. "The 
Laguna Beach clinic is not strong enough to survive as it is right now," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobin agreed that the Laguna Beach clinic is under pressure to meet OPTIMA's 
Feb. 15 deadline to report how the clinic will expand its systems for quality 
assurance, utilization review and physician credentials. These systems, she 
said, are costly and could be more easily supported by a larger clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Laguna Beach clinic recorded about 20,000 patient visits, Cobin 
said, a third of which were reimbursed by Medi-Cal. A spokeswoman for the South 
County Community Clinic said the clinic will handle about 17,000 patient visits 
this year, one-quarter of them Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to worries that Laguna's family planning program might be in 
jeopardy, Birtcher said that if the San Juan Capistrano clinic agrees to the 
affiliation, "I don't want to scrap any of their programs. . . . They have a 
long tradition of serving the people of Laguna Beach and the last thing you 
want to do is interrupt that."

GIVING HIM THE BOOT; WHEN IT COMES TO REPAIRS, CLIENTS KNOW HE DOESN'T HORSE 
AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Andreas Chianis' shop, boots made from the skin of ostriches and reptiles 
alternate with boots made from plain cowhide. Some are fancy, hand-stitched 
footwear that will never come within 100 yards of a horse; other pairs have 
heels worn down from hours in the stirrups. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having merchandise with price tags that range from under $100 to 
several thousand dollars, Chianis sees all the boots the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who buy boots, they don't just throw them away when they get worn 
out," said Chianis, 66, who is known around here as the boot man. "They bring 
them to me; I make them good as new." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 45 years, Chianis has repaired the boots of hundreds of cowboys 
and those that dress like them. He also repairs shoes, briefcases and purses, 
but boots and other Western gear are most of his trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the horse community know Andreas does good work," said Carol 
Cantwell, a member of Yorba Country Riders. "They take their boots and tack to 
him because he is the best around. He appreciates how expensive this stuff is." 
</P>
<P>
 Chianis is one of just a handful of people in the county who specialize in 
boot repair. Melody Tetz-Aragon, manager of Thieves Market in Fullerton, refers 
all her customers to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality of his work, the materials he uses, is what makes the 
difference," Tetz-Aragon said. "Boot repair is different from shoe repair, and 
Andreas has a reputation for quality work."  
</P>
<P>
 "I own 28 pairs of boots, and I've been bringing them to him for years," said 
Scott Brebner of Irvine. "I wouldn't take them to anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although he owns just four pairs of boots himself, Chianis said Western 
footwear fascinates him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each pair is so unique," he said. "They have different skins, colors and 
stitching. Some are tall, some aren't. It's exciting to see how many different 
kinds of boots there are." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the 11-hour days he puts in, Chianis says he loves his work. The 
highlight of his job is when he makes a pair of custom-ordered boots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Creating something one-of-a-kind, that's the greatest feeling," Chianis said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Chianis learned his trade from his father, working after school in the 
family's boot repair shop in Long Beach and later as an apprentice in the shoe 
repair department of a local store. As much as he learned during those years, 
it was an eight-month stint repairing ski boots that Chianis remembers most. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young Army pilot during World War II, Chianis was shot down over Germany 
during World War II. After his captors discovered Chianis' trade, he was put to 
work in a boot repair shop in a nearby town.  
</P>
<P>
 "A prison guard marched me into town every morning and I would work fixing ski 
boots," Chianis said. "He'd come back for me in the evening, and I would go 
back to the camp." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being left unsupervised at times, "I never thought about escaping 
because I knew the Allies would be coming for us soon," Chianis said. "And I 
had heard of men trying to escape and getting shot. I figured I could wait." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the war, Chianis returned to Long Beach, where he opened Andy's 
Boot Repair on Broadway and Magnolia, near the site of the current Long Beach 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved his shop several times, finally opening Andreas Boot Repair in Yorba 
Linda about 12 years ago when a friend built a shopping center at Bastanchury 
Road and Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 With its miles of horse trails and large population of equestrians, Yorba 
Linda is the perfect place for a boot repair shop. Business is good, Chianis 
said, but he worries about who will replace him when he retires. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nobody who wants to learn this trade. I get students from Cal State 
Fullerton here, all they want to know is how much they get paid, what kind of 
benefits do they get," Chianis said. "None of them want to work to learn what I 
know."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; COURT TO TAKE UP 'CASTLE' ISSUE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's plans to demolish the castle-like home belonging to Haym and Fern 
Ganish on Tuesday are again on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court commissioner on Wednesday set a Jan. 18 date 
to hear an appeal by Fern Ganish. She is seeking more time to comply with city 
deadlines for completion of what is now a 12-year remodeling job. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wants to save the house," said attorney John Barthrop. "The problem is, 
the family doesn't have the money to finish it by hiring a contractor. They're 
trying to do the work themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Barthrop said Haym Ganish is working day and night to bring his three-story, 
stone-covered home into compliance with building and safety codes. The family 
has battled with city officials during the last dozen years over the on-again, 
off-again transformation of the single-story home into a baroque castle. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the home is unsafe and in violation of state building 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fern Ganish pleaded no contest last month to criminal charges filed against 
her by the city. The compromise agreement gave her one year to complete 
renovations. Her husband, Haym Ganish, refused to take part in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fern Ganish was required to submit new building plans and a $50,000 bond 
to the city by Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system we set up required them to make certain time deadlines," Irvine 
City Atty. Joel D. Kuperberg said. "They missed the very first deadline." 
</P>
<P>
 Barthrop says Fern Ganish is unable to post a $50,000 bond. But he also says 
she is sincere in attempting to complete renovations inside the home as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials say the latest legal motion filed by Fern Ganish does not 
give the city any assurance the work will be completed.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason to delay this thing," Kuperberg said. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; OWNER FIGHTS PANEL'S ORDER TO REPAVE 
CITY-OWNED ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local businessman hammered away at the City Council for two hours at its 
meeting this week, contending that conditions the city wants to impose on his 
planned coffeehouse amount to "double taxation."  
</P>
<P>
 Lance LeCompte is seeking a use permit to turn a former antique shop on Los 
Alamitos Boulevard into a cafe.He has fought restrictions being sought by the 
Planning Commission since early November. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of his fight is a $10,000 repaving job the commission wants him to 
do on a city-owned alley next to his property, LeCompte said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only access to the property's parking area is the alley, so the city can 
require him to remove the asphalt and repave with sturdier concrete, city 
engineer Victor Rollinger said, citing a city ordinance requiring developers to 
replace alley asphalt with concrete when redeveloping. Because of a projected 
increase in traffic, the city is also asking that LeCompte improve access to 
the alley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my opinion that the city is on solid legal ground in requiring this 
repaving," City Atty. Thomas W. Allen said.  
</P>
<P>
 LeCompte repeatedly insisted that he is not a developer. He said he is a 
private citizen who has paid city taxes to maintain alleys and that the 
requirements constitute a form of double taxation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am simply proposing a change in use (of the building) . . . . This is 
tantamount to asking me to pay again for a service I have already paid for and 
never received." 
</P>
<P>
 LeCompte also contends that skewed statistics were used to come up with the 
city's traffic projections. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council decided to continue the hearing for two weeks until it can 
review a traffic study that LeCompte commissioned and insisted be included in 
the deliberations. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA HABRA; ART WORKSHOPS KEEP HANDS, IMAGINATIONS BUSY

 Parents watched from the sidelines Wednesday at the Children's Museum as 
children trotted between tables, pondering what kind of ornament to craft, 
which color to choose and whether they should add yarn to their artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 While little hands folded together paper dreidels and sifted through buckets 
filled with markers, adults took a breather from a hectic holiday weekend at 
the museum's seasonal drop-in art workshop, offered throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got a week and a half of their vacation left, this is a good way to 
keep them busy," said a sighing Lucy Price, a West Covina mother of four.  
</P>
<P>
 The workshops began the week before Christmas and will continue through New 
Year's Eve. Between 130 to 150 children mill through the workshops, reveling in 
cutting out Santas and coloring menorah pictures, museum officials said. The 
Children's Museum at La Habra is at 301 S. Euclid St. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Christmas has passed, art enthusiasts said holiday decorations, like 
sample reindeer puppets, cutout stockings and posters celebrating Kwanzaa, help 
children use their imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good opportunity for children to develop their creativity," said 
Ted Flink, a Hacienda Height resident baby-sitting for friends. "While their 
mom and my wife are out shopping, I bring them here. This is much better for me 
and them both." 
</P>
<P>
 Some decorated cutout Christmas trees with glittery stars and mini-bears. 
Others stocked up on homemade ornaments for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love art," said a shy Alex Gillespie, 5, from La Habra Heights.  
</P>
<P>
 She showed off her snowman ornament to her mother, who said the creation will 
be an addition to Alex's collection of handmade decorations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll put this in her box of artwork," Beth Gillespie said, "and we'll hang it 
up on our tree next year." TINA NGUYEN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; POLICE TO CONTINUE THREE-DAY WORKWEEK 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have been given the go-ahead to continue working three 12 1/2-hour days 
per week and an additional 10-hour day each month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department has been trying the new work schedule for nine months 
and last week overwhelmingly recommended keeping it. 
</P>
<P>
 An evaluation of the schedule concluded that police favored it and that the 
city saved money in overtime pay. It also reported an increase in morale and a 
faster response time to emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers reported that the work schedule reduces commuting time, allows them 
to buy homes farther away from the station and gives them more time to spend 
with their families, study and enjoy hobbies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really enjoying it," Lt. Tony Hernandez said. "The officers work the 
12 1/2-hour days and then choose how they will put in the other 10 hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The officers can either work the 10 hours or deduct the hours from their 
vacation or compensation time, Hernandez said. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; ROCK HIT TRUCK NEAR PROTEST SITE, MAN SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Aliso Viejo man told police a tollway protester hurled a potato-sized rock 
at his pickup Tuesday night, cracking his windshield, as he drove along Laguna 
Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first report of violence by opponents of the San Joaquin Hills toll 
road, police said. Protesters lined Laguna Canyon Road last week after 
court-allowed grading began Dec. 20, only to be halted Friday by a second 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, (violence) hasn't been a trend," said Orange County Sheriff's Lt. 
William Francis, adding that he knows of no other reports of similar trouble in 
the area. "Sounds like an aberration." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Canyon Conservancy director Michael Phillips said Wednesday he was 
unaware of the police report, adding that he strongly denounces such tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who did do something as stupid as that deserves to have the law come 
down on them with both feet," Phillips said. "That's not at all what we're 
about. We're trying to save the canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond J. Price, a cabinet restorer, said the rock was thrown at his truck 
about 7:45 p.m. as he was driving south on the curvy road. It did not go 
through the windshield, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, 42, said he saw two men in their 20s holding a sign saying "It's a 
Sin," but when he pulled over to see why they threw the rock, they drove off in 
a white Mercedes toward the San Diego Freeway. They were the only people at the 
site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said the men may have mistaken his truck for one driven by tollway work 
crews, since it was dark. He said he did nothing to provoke the attack and even 
supports tollway demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand their feelings. I don't particularly want a freeway going 
through there, either," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the 17-mile road, which would cut through Laguna Canyon as it 
links Newport Beach and San Juan Capistrano, staged four days of protests last 
week before Friday's injunction. Twenty-one people were arrested, including 
some who locked themselves by the neck to bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said he is not aware of any protests the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most times they cooperate and they just try to get their message across in a 
peaceful manner," Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Jim White said Wednesday about the 
road's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, however, tempers flare. 
</P>
<P>
 During anti-tollway demonstrations in June, Phillips said, he was hit in the 
leg when a passing motorist threw a full plastic water bottle as he stood along 
Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A new ruling on tollway construction is expected Jan. 5. LESLIE EARNEST

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO CHILD MOLESTATION 
</P>

<P>
 A Lake Forest man has pleaded guilty to posing as a Los Angeles radio station 
personality and offering teen-age girls concert tickets in exchange for sexual 
favors. 
</P>
<P>
 David Eugene Zebe, 27, plead guilty Tuesday in Municipal Court in Laguna 
Niguel on one count of child molestation, one count of attempted child 
molestation and seven counts of misdemeanor child annoyance, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Claudia Silbar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zebe had approached more than 30 girls, ages 14 to 17, from October to early 
November, with the ticket offer and kissed one 15-year-old, Silbar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were several times where there was real minimal contact," she said. "We 
didn't file on those. Once he started insinuating anything sexual, and once he 
contacted the child again, we filed child annoyance." 
</P>
<P>
 Zebe was sentenced to 240 days in jail and five years' probation. As of 
Sunday, new legislation will also require Zebe to register as a sex offender in 
whatever city he lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an appropriate sentence," Silbar said. "The most serious 
completed act was a kiss to a 15-year-old. He also expressed a great deal of 
remorse and said he needed help. The judge gave him a break because he was 
asking for help." 
</P>
<P>
 Zebe also had cooperated with investigators by supplying them with the names 
and phone numbers of some of the girls he approached, Deputy Public Defender 
Mike McClellan said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's a nice kid who has absolutely no criminal background," McClellan said. 
"I thought the judge was a little bit heavy." 
</P>
<P>
 Zebe will serve his sentence at Orange County Jail, where he has been since 
his arrest Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrested Zebe after a 15-year-old Aliso Viejo High School student 
told officers that she was scheduled to meet Zebe that day. The girl had been 
warned by a friend from Santiago High School that a suspicious man was going 
around offering girls concert tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Zebe allegedly posed as an employee of the alternative radio station, KROQ-FM. 
He was never employed at the radio station. NANCY HSU

 The March of Dimes is soliciting walkers and pledges for its 25th annual 
WalkAmerica to raise money to fight birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,500 walkers raised $350,000 by walking the five-mile course 
through Huntington Beach this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the event hope to assemble 5,000 walkers and raise $500,000 in 
the 1995 walk, scheduled for April 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "Participants should know that 78% of the money they raise goes directly to 
research, education and community services and 60% of every dollar stays right

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 2 UCLA STUDENTS FROM O.C. WIN SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Orange County students have been named distinguished scholars at UCLA, 
campus officials said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Pooneh Hendi of Anaheim Hills and Oliver Wright of Costa Mesa won the 
prestigious award. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are among 21 undergraduates to be recognized by the UCLA Alumni 
Assn. for outstanding achievement in the classroom and service to the campus 
and surrounding community. Undergraduate distinguished scholars must have a 
grade point average of 3.5 or higher. 
</P>
<P>
 To be considered for scholarships -- which range from $500 to $2,500 -- 
students must be nominated by a professor or instructor in their department. 
</P>
<P>
 "This particular award is perhaps the most competitive at UCLA," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Hayashida of the UCLA Alumni Assn. said scholarship money comes from 
donations and endowments. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendi, 24, studies linguistics and biochemistry. She is a senior who came to 
Orange County from Tehran, Iran, in 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 She said she is doing research at the UCLA Medical Center into alternatives to 
cardiac transplant for low-income patients and hopes to enter medical school 
next year to concentrate in oncology. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to make some achievements in that field, especially for women," 
Hendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, 22, is a senior working on a degree in communications. 
</P>
<P>
 He has done research into how gender was discussed in the media during the 
1992 U.S. Senate race in California, which involved two female victors. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said he is currently researching how reporting of crime in the media 
differs according to the race of suspects and victims. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, Wright hopes to become a 
Fulbright scholar and attend Harvard Law School. ALICIA DI RADO

SEX BIAS CLAIM FILED BY FORMER WORKER AT FIVE FEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A longtime waitress at the Five Feet Restaurant has sued the owner, a cook and 
other male kitchen workers at the fashionable eatery, alleging sexual 
harassment, assault and battery and infliction of emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Marti Fitzpatrick, who worked at the popular downtown restaurant for seven 
years before leaving last September, charged in a lawsuit filed in Orange 
County Superior Court on Tuesday that Michael Kang, one of the owners, took 
part in some of the alleged abuse and did nothing to halt his employees' 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Kang's co-owners, Joseph Gelber, said Wednesday he had not seen the 
lawsuit but called the charges ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were aware of her allegations and did a thorough investigation and, based 
upon our investigation, it's our opinion they are groundless," Gelber said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit contends that, "on almost a daily basis," the kitchen workers 
called Fitzpatrick offensive names and made her the focus of sexual comments 
and innuendo. Those abuses included sexually suggestive body gestures by a 
cook, whom Fitzpatrick claims once physically assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzpatrick's lawsuit contends that she suffered physical injury, severe 
emotional distress and embarrassment. She is seeking unspecified damages.

MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN FRIEND'S SHOOTING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA NGUYEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-year-old Garden Grove man pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter 
Wednesday in connection with the shooting death of a friend who was felled by 
an off-duty security guard during a fracas at a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Tu Anh Tran, who faced a possible life sentence in the slaying of his friend 
and attempted murder and robbery of the security guard, will serve three years 
of probation under a plea agreement that brings to a close an unusual case, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran was arrested last April after his friend, Kinh Van Chu, 37, was shot 
during a fight with Narin S. Thong, an off-duty security guard, at a 
Westminster restaurant. During the attack, Thong, 26, fired his gun, killing 
Chu and wounding Tran in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Thong told police that a group of men had attacked him and tried to rob him of 
his gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities determined the shooting was done in self-defense, but prosecutors 
charged Tran under a state Penal Code provision that allows a suspect to be 
charged with murder when a "provocative act" results in death. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran insisted Wednesday that he is innocent of any crime. However, he said he 
took the plea bargain rather than risk being found guilty by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to take it for my life," he said. "I didn't want to take the risk of 
losing my freedom."  
</P>
<P>
 Tran's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Jeff Lund, said Tran opted for the 
plea agreement so he could pursue his future plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not happy about pleading guilty. But like in any other negotiation, he 
gave up his exoneration to get out of jail and continue his education," Lund 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robin Park, the prosecutor in the case, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Santiago College student who once dreamed of becoming a public 
school soccer coach said the felony on his record has shattered his career 
goals.  
</P>
<P>
 "This has really hurt my future," said Tran, who was bound for the University 
of Iowa next fall to continue his education. "It's not fair. I got (the 
security guard's) crime on my record." 
</P>
<P>
 Tran's case gained support among the Alliance Working for Asian Rights and 
Empowerment (AWARE), which alleged that Tran is one of a number of Asian 
Americans wrongfully suspected of gang activity. AWARE activists said they are 
dissatisfied with the outcome of the case, believing Tran was wrongfully 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still upset. We wanted him to walk free, but there was only so much we 
could do," said Kim Ha, an AWARE member. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertain of his future now, Tran said the first step is to return to Rancho 
Santiago College and complete the final credits needed for his associate of 
arts degree.

POST OFFICE MATH DOES MAKE SENSE -- TO THEM; WHY A HIKE TO 32 CENTS WHEN 35 
WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO FIGURE? FOR STARTERS, THERE'S THIS LAW . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation once again will be plunged into a state of chaos on Sunday as the 
price of a first-class stamp goes from 29 cents to 32 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not the rate hike, per se, that's irritating many consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few cents more won't matter," shrugged Jean Anne Brown philosophically as 
she looked through her mail at Glendale's main post office last week. 
</P>
<P>
 What's annoying and confusing will be the need to deal with new numbers, new 
multiples, new bottom lines. Yes, just when we knew by heart that a book of 20 
29ers was $5.80, along comes a whole new set of computations for those among us 
who didn't exactly excel in Math 101. 
</P>
<P>
 And why, oh, why did they pick something hard to calculate like 32? 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're going to raise it, why not raise it to 35 cents and forget it for 
10 years?" asked Nick Johnston while pumping coins into a self-service stamp 
machine at the downtown Burbank post office. 
</P>
<P>
 A 35-cent postage stamp also makes sense to Larry Russell, another patron. "I 
think they should level off the price," he said. "It'd be easier, change-wise." 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon Golomb doesn't understand why there's math anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty-two is a much rounder number than 29," said the USC professor of 
mathematics and electrical engineering. "It's more divisible by more things." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting into the swing at the stamp counter won't be hard, he insisted. "Five 
32s would be $1.60," Golomb said during a phone interview, with nary a 
background sound of a calculator or adding machine. "Twenty-five would be eight 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Uh-huh. But here's a man who, just for a lark, once memorized the first 1,000 
digits of pi -- the two- vertical- lines- with- a- squiggle- on- top symbol 
that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. No 
big deal, at least for him. "Several million digits of pi have been 
calculated," he added modestly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Did the postal powers-that-be take into account that some of us still count on 
our fingers and rely on very round numbers when buying anything from postage 
stamps to rutabagas in bulk? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, said Charles Robinson, a senior analyst at the U.S. Postal Rate 
Commission, an independent government agency that considers rate hike requests 
from the U.S. Postal Service and issues recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "By law, we have to think about simplicity of the rate structure," said 
Robinson, referring to the 1970 Postal Reorganization Act. But in the next 
breath, he explained the odd-number odysseys: "By law, revenues have to equal 
expenses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To consumers, it might seem simple to bypass a 32-cent stamp in favor of a 
35-cent one. But that increase, said Robert Cohen, director of rates, analysis 
and planning for the commission, would wreak havoc on the break-even mandate. 
"It would mean $2.7 billion in extra revenues for first class and require 
lowering rates for the rest of the classes," he said, "which would be 
inequitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Math-phobic postal patrons may be overreacting, Robinson said, pointing out 
that there have been some nice round prices for first-class stamps -- 15 cents 
in 1978, 20 cents in 1981 and 25 cents in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson thinks the tougher math problems will plague businesses who use other 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-class mail, which includes magazines and newspapers, is considered the 
most complex because it involves such things as piece rates, pound rates, 
zoning and advertising- to- editorial ratio, the postal people say. 
</P>
<P>
 "From 29 to 32, that's simple," said Robinson, who is sad to see the demise of 
29-cent stamps, in use since 1991, for an entirely different reason. "I like 29 
because it's a prime number," he said wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If mathematicians and analysts think we're overreacting, mental health experts 
sympathize. It's not abnormal, they say, to have a bit of angst . 
</P>
<P>
 "Nice round numbers are easier," says Paul Andreassen, a social psychologist 
in Deerfield Beach, Fla. "It represents a need for control -- not in a 
manipulative sense, but in terms of having a sense of mastery over the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Coping with the postal rate hike, in his view, can be a stressor. "Any time 
you take something small and make it more difficult it becomes an irritation 
and little irritations add up. People are more prone to get sick when they have 
(many) small hassles in their life." 
</P>
<P>
 When it's not so simple to do the math in your head, the stress can worsen. It 
makes sense to him that postal patrons are suggesting a 35-cent stamp -- "35 
cents seems easier to figure than 32." 
</P>
<P>
 Postal patrons who aren't very good at math "should just memorize some stamp 
multiples," Andreassen suggested. "Two are 64 and three are about a dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time people are regularly writing 1995 on their checks," Andreassen 
said, they'll also be accustomed to new stamp prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless, of course, they are the rebellious type, like David Londagin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to use fax," the 70-year-old Pasadena businessman said stubbornly 
during what may have been his last trip to the Glendale post office.

TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF; ACTIVISM: VICTOR CRAWFORD ONCE LOBBIED FOR THE TOBACCO 
INSTITUTE. NOW HE FIGHTS AGAINST IT. WHAT CHANGED HIS MIND? HE'S DYING OF 
THROAT CAACTIVISM: NCER -- A RESULT OF DECADES OF HEAVY SMOKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victor Crawford's story is sadly familiar, that of a man who started smoking 
in his early teens and now is dying of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crawford stands out among the thousands who share his predicament, because 
he is a former lobbyist for the Tobacco Institute and has turned on his former 
client -- speaking out against youth smoking and the tactics of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to make some amends," the 62-year-old Maryland lawyer said in an 
interview. "And I have heard back from my former employers that they don't 
think it's quite kosher to bite the hand that fed you -- and they have a good 
point. . . . It's just that I think my point's more important." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, "What are they going to do, give me cancer?" 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran Maryland state senator, Crawford later cashed in as a lobbyist, 
helping the tobacco industry gut public smoking curbs. Wearing a wig to hide 
the baldness caused by cancer treatments, Crawford earlier this year returned 
to his old statehouse stomping grounds to urge support for tough workplace 
smoking rules. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in radio ads calling for a 
higher federal tax on cigarettes to discourage youth smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't work for the tobacco industry anymore," he said in one ad. "I was 
diagnosed with throat cancer, caused by smoking. It's too late for me, but not 
for our kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford also weighed in against California's Proposition 188, warning that 
the industry-drafted measure to repeal local ordinances would "set the 
anti-smoking movement back 30 years." It was defeated in November. 
</P>
<P>
 And while struggling to maintain his law practice, Crawford has made time for 
activists and officials seeking advice in the smoking wars. Mississippi Atty. 
Gen. Mike Moore, who has sued tobacco firms to recover state health-care costs, 
was a recent visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tall and gaunt, with a trial lawyer's instinct for theater, Crawford betrays 
little self-pity, and seems more angry at himself than the cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the hell, it's my own fault," he said. "I was well-paid, and paid right 
on time. . . . I took their money, and I knew it was bad, (but) it was the 
great American Dream -- who cares as long as you're making money?" 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford's dramatic conversion has made him something of a hero to the 
anti-smoking cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is his finest hour," said Bruce Adams, a member of the Montgomery 
County, Md., county council and a tobacco foe who previously fought Crawford 
over anti-smoking legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a guy who has obviously suffered tremendously . . . and anyone could 
completely understand if he wanted to be doing things for himself," Adams said. 
Yet, "He decided he was wrong and he spoke out." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, industry officials seem loath to criticize. "He has the right 
to say what he believes," said Brennan Dawson, spokeswoman for the Tobacco 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Crawford a "dear friend," Bruce C. Bereano, a veteran lobbyist for the 
institute in Maryland, said he understood "what (Crawford) is doing and why. . 
. . It is not a reckless, knee-jerk reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 But "I guess the way to put it is, I wish he were not doing it," Bereano said. 
The institute "was his client once, and I just have different views about . . . 
a lawyer having a client (and) taking a conflicting position with that client 
subsequently." 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford, Bereano said, also may be "being used by groups and the media in 
terms of their own public policy agendas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford, a Democrat, served 16 years in the Maryland legislature before 
retiring in 1983. He resumed a full-time law practice and began lobbying for a 
few white-hat clients. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crawford knew the big bucks came from rich, embattled industries. "I was 
on the lookout for that, and when (the Tobacco Institute) first approached me 
(in 1986), I said sure, I was real, real interested." 
</P>
<P>
 During the next six years, Crawford went to battle against smoking 
restrictions. The industry was determined "to fight everything, stall 
everything . . . (to) buy time until the Third World countries are flooded," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the argument seemed hopeless, as it often did, Crawford changed the 
subject -- portraying his adversaries as "health Nazis" bent on destroying 
freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never attack the message. You attack the messengers," Crawford said. "You 
can't attack the message . . . because it's obvious. I mean, for example, 'Is 
it addictive?' Ask anybody who smokes a pack or more a day, especially if they 
started in their teens, to just stop and see what they go through. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Even now, after all I've been through, I'd still love a cigarette. Sitting 
here, drinking a cup of coffee, a cigarette would be so great. And if that's 
not an addiction, I don't know what is." 
</P>
<P>
 When Crawford was a kid, Bogart and Cagney were chain-smoking heroes of the 
silver screen. "You weren't a real man unless you smoked," he recalled. And so 
he did -- starting with cigarettes at age 13 and later switching to pipes and 
cigars. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford learned he had throat cancer in January, 1992. "Victor," he said the 
doctor told him, "You're right out of a medical textbook -- you've got a lesion 
on your throat, and it's from smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 Surgeons saved Crawford's voice, but removed the lymph nodes and all the 
muscle from the left side of his neck. He had radiation treatments and thought 
he was doing pretty well -- until he learned last year that the malignancy had 
spread. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford was disgusted that he, like so many others, had fallen into the trap 
of believing it could not happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always the other fellow," he said. "How do you get an 18- or 19-year-old 
to charge up a hill to a machine-gun nest? It's the other guy who's going to 
get it." Then, when it happens to you, "you feel like a bit of an ass." 
</P>
<P>
 At the oncology center, seeing the suffering of fellow patients, he also 
thought, "Did I help cause some of this? Sure. Am I now paying the price for 
it? Sure." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Crawford did not experience a lightning conversion. He did not want to 
make a spectacle of himself, nor be seen as disloyal. For a long time pride and 
caution held him back. But for a remarkable encounter, he might never have 
spoken out. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford practiced t'ai chi ch'uan, the Chinese exercise regimen, and on 
Saturday mornings joined other t'ai chi devotees in a park. Another in the 
group was Michael Pertschuk, former head of the Federal Trade Commission and 
co-director of the Advocacy Institute, an anti-smoking group. 
</P>
<P>
 Pertschuk knew Crawford only as one of the more flamboyant practitioners of 
t'ai chi. Otherwise, the men were strangers. Then one Saturday in the fall of 
1993, "I noticed he had gotten very thin, and I thought, 'uh-oh,' " Pertschuk 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Several in the group went to breakfast that morning, and Pertschuk and 
Crawford talked for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be a tobacco lobbyist," Pertschuk remembered him saying. "Now I've 
got throat cancer, and I guess I got my just deserts." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the wildest coincidence. Like others in the anti-smoking movement, 
Pertschuk had marveled at how well the industry had kept its minions in line. A 
business so large and controversial would be expected to produce its share of 
moles and defectors -- yet rarely had any come forward. If insiders were 
carrying around delicious secrets or a sense of guilt, they had kept them to 
themselves. And yet here was Victor Crawford, voicing such regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford, however, was not ready to go public. "He wasn't sure he wanted to 
turn on people who had been good to him, people he had worked with," Pertschuk 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But later, at Pertschuk's suggestion, Crawford agreed to an off-the-record 
meeting with the writer of a profile on tobacco executives. After they talked 
last winter, the writer, Roger Rosenblatt, urged Crawford to step into the 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 "Washington is full of these nameless, faceless, well-placed sources who are 
journalists talking to each other," Crawford recalled Rosenblatt saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford gave permission, and his story became the powerful conclusion of the 
article, which ran last March in the New York Times Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford since has been much in demand. "Suddenly, here I am, sort of like 
Topsy. I seem to have growed," he said. But "somebody's got to do it, and I 
seem to have been elected." 
</P>
<P>
 "The wonderful thing (Crawford) does is to expose their hypocrisy in a way 
that no one else can," Pertschuk said. "He's got incredible courage, and he 
just faces cancer and death with an insouciance that I hope I have. But beyond 
that, this has given him meaning." 
</P>
<P>
 With his sense of irony and self-effacing wit, Crawford seems like a man who 
would be tickled by the turn his life has taken, if only his prospects weren't 
so dim. 
</P>
<P>
 He talks of his treatments with taxol, an experimental cancer drug derived 
from the bark of the yew, found in the dwindling old-growth forests of the 
Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, when Crawford read about an endangered minnow or weed blocking a 
highway project, he thought the world had gone mad. His attitude adjustment has 
been such that he now gives to the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to say that I owe my life to the spotted owl," Crawford joked. 
"There's nothing like being directly affected."

FASHION; MODELS PUT A 'NEW FACE' ON HIV; MARKETING: A COSTA MESA AGENCY USES 
PEOPLE WITH THE VIRUS TO SHINE A MORE UPBEAT LIGHT ON THOSE WHO ARE INFECTED -- 
AND TO SELL PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Model Rebekka Armstrong leans over to give a photographer a hug after a long 
afternoon photo session. But she falls forward and stumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sorry," she says softly, "It's the dementia." 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing conversation is not about her eyes, her makeup or her best side. 
Instead, she chats about doctors, drugs and T-cell counts, and it's clear that 
this former Playboy Playmate is a giant reality-check apart from most who 
strike a pose to make a buck. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong is one of 40 models with HIV or AIDS working in the Proof Positive 
Division of the Morgan Agency in Costa Mesa. They hope their fresh, healthy 
appearance will spread a message about the virus that has so far infected an 
estimated 750,000 to 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many people out there living with the disease and they don't 
fill a certain stereotype," says Morgan Agency president Keith Lewis. "They are 
very conscious about their health, and we think it's important to show them. We 
feel good about ushering in the new face of HIV." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency began its search for HIV-infected models a year ago, and Proof 
Positive is now the fastest growing segment of the agency, Lewis says. Although 
a few clients were "a little nervous" at first, he says, the models have been 
widely accepted in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But one national ad using a Proof Positive model has met with controversy. 
Critics say it exploits and incites fear among HIV-infected patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The print ad, featuring Christopher Crays of Costa Mesa in a tank top and gym 
shorts, is for Advera, a nutritional supplement promoted by Ross Products 
Division of Abbott Laboratories as effective against progressive weight loss. 
Progressive weight loss, or wasting syndrome, leads to malnutrition, one of the 
leading causes of AIDS-related deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never worried too much about nutrition," the ad copy reads, "Then my doctor 
told me I was HIV-positive. Now I do everything I can to maintain my energy, 
strength and quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad campaign has taken most of its hits from Dr. John Stansell, medical 
director of San Francisco General Hospital's AIDS Clinic, who has called the 
disease-specific pitch "a disgusting distortion." 
</P>
<P>
 "The advertising gives the impression that every HIV-positive person needs to 
be taking supplements," he says. "Advera is a good product. But most (HIV) 
patients don't need Advera if they eat balanced meals. When I heard the radio 
ads, I was really angry. It was the way they pitched it to the entire HIV 
community, as if all patients needed it. They used fear, really, I believe, to 
turn a profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Executives from Ross Products and LCF & L, the New York agency that created 
the ad, did not respond to requests for comments about the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Crays, who is 35 and has been HIV-positive for more than six years, says he is 
proud of the campaign, the product, and his recognition as "the Advera man." He 
and many other HIV-positive patients take a pro-active approach to their 
health, Cray says, not a reactive one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The likelihood is that this (virus) is probably going to kick me in the butt. 
I don't want to live my life like that," he says. "Nutrition is a very 
important part of my life. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to get rid of this perception that we are all wasting away or on our 
death beds." 
</P>
<P>
 Proof Positive, which now generates 10% of the 466-client talent and modeling 
agency's business, was started in response to an increasing demand for 
HIV-positive models to promote products such as Advera. But many of the models 
have also promoted products and companies with no connection to the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Ballard of Hollywood is one of the division's most successful models and 
is currently promoting his own greeting card line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a model. I'm a face to connect with an epidemic," says Ballard, 36, a 
former real estate finance attorney. "And this really isn't about modeling. 
It's a way to say that there are people out there with HIV. This could be 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Ballard practiced law for 10 years in a large Los Angeles firm before fatigue 
and other symptoms made it too difficult to handle 60- to 80-hour workweeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't really say that I like doing this more than practicing law, I love 
law. But I feel good about this and the message we're sending," he said. "It's 
very important."

COUPLE WONDER WHERE CASH FLOWS; FINANCE: DESPITE A DUAL SALARY OF $90,000, O.C. 
PAIR SAY THEY LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. ADVISERS SHOW THEM HOW TO PUT MONEY TO 
BETTER USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In many ways, Ed Johnston and Pat Rollyson live the typical middle-class 
Orange County lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 He is an aerospace worker, and she is a nurse. They own a home in Anaheim, a 
12-foot fishing boat, an aging motor home, a new motorcycle and two 10-year-old 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Their household includes Rollyson's teen-age children Robert, 17, and Dawn, 
16, as well as Johnston's 26-year-old daughter, Kori, who is attending a 
private flight attendant training school in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Their annual salaries total $90,000, which looks impressive on paper, but in 
fact the couple say they are living from paycheck to paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at the pay stubs," Johnston said, "and then what happens is we say, 
'My God! We made $90,000 last year! Where did it go?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston and Rollyson keep up with day-to-day expenses, but they never have 
enough left over to start an emergency fund, add to their retirement savings or 
even take a nice vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 They confess that a big part of their problem is lack of discipline. To find 
solutions, they met with Irvine financial planner Victoria Felton-Collins, who 
drew up a makeover plan for them. Pat Szekel, a tax accountant in Orange, also 
reviewed the couple's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Felton-Collins' proposal would help Johnston and Rollyson exceed their modest 
goal of staying even in 1995. It isn't that the money isn't there, she said, 
it's that they don't keep track of it or put it to its best use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't wait around for a magic answer," Felton-Collins advises. "You have to 
have discipline to change your situation." 
</P>
<P>
 When the couple actually listed their monthly expenses, they could see where 
the money goes: $1,560 for their house payment, taxes and insurance; a $225 
payment and insurance on the motorcycle, which Johnston rides to work, and 
about $120 a month for car insurance that covers two teen-age drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional $520 goes for utilities, cable television and phone bills, 
including hefty long-distance charges because most of the couple's relatives 
and many of their friends live out of state. That pushes their total monthly 
expenses to $2,425 -- not counting groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 The supermarket claims a big chunk of the couple's cash. Rollyson said she is 
a disciplined shopper: "I go and spend $400, and we have two weeks' worth of 
groceries in the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston, however, is an impulse shopper, she said: "You take the kids and go 
and spend $140 and come back with junk." 
</P>
<P>
 He concedes that "I really wish I knew where it all went. . . . It just seems 
to go for general stuff."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The couple can verify that their money does, indeed, slip away. At the end of 
November, for example, they had less than $1,000 in their joint checking 
account and $300 in savings. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting with the couple, financial planner Felton-Collins found one area 
that both were overlooking: Johnston uses the Internal Revenue Service as a 
savings bank. He likes the idea of getting a big refund every year -- he says 
it averages $8,000 -- so he has far more money withheld than is required. 
</P>
<P>
 Felton-Collins advised Johnston to rethink his approach. "Don't continue 
letting Uncle Sam use your money interest-free," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $500 to $650 that is withheld each month in excess of Johnston's actual 
tax liability would go a long way toward building an emergency, retirement or 
vacation fund, she said, if it were invested in a mutual fund or used to buy a 
six-month or one-year certificate of deposit at a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 She also encouraged the couple to install a simple financial planning program 
on their home computer and to use it to keep track of their expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they have a joint checking account and both write checks to pay bills, 
Johnston and Rollyson often don't know the actual balance in the account. 
Felton-Collins suggests that the major bill-paying chores be delegated to one 
of them and that incidental checks be entered religiously into the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax accountant Szekel agreed. "They don't even have to have a budget," he 
said. "Just keeping track of expenses by category is a big step." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes calling up your expenses at the end of the month or year and seeing 
what you are really spending your money on will be enough to shock you into 
changing your spending habits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both experts also encouraged the couple to put aside as much as they can for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Retirement plans let you save current tax dollars and allow your money to 
grow tax-deferred," Felton-Collins said, because the benefits aren't taxable 
until they are paid out, and when a person retires he or she usually moves to a 
lower tax bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital where Rollyson works has no retirement plan now but is starting 
one soon. The experts urged her to sign up as soon as she can and contribute 
the maximum amount possible. Johnston already does that with his retirement 
program, they said, and should continue doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Felton-Collins also recommended that the couple review their auto and 
homeowner insurance policies with the aim of reducing premium payments by 
increasing the deductibles. Even savings of $20 a month would add up over time. 
Also, she suggested that the couple consider replacing costly mortgage life 
insurance with regular term life insurance, which often costs far less for the 
same amount of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston said he and Rollyson definitely plan to set up a budget and keep 
track of expenses. "That makes real sense," he said. "We can look at it and 
find out what we are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 He said they will consider Felton-Collins' other suggestions, and he liked the 
idea of replacing the mortgage insurance with less costly term life policies, 
but he didn't see much benefit in raising his auto and homeowner deductibles.  
</P>
<P>
 "If it only saves $20 a month," he said, "we'd just spend that on junk." 
</P>
<P>
 He was leery too about changing his tax withholding. "I may be giving the 
government an interest-free loan now," he said, "but I get it back every year, 
and I can make plans to use it."

 "I had money in mutual funds once," Johnston said, "and you can lose money 
there. And if I put it into a savings account every month, I'd just spend it. I 
work in aerospace, and we have a saying that expenses expand to use up the 
money that's available."

 Tax accountant Szekel said the couple must follow whatever course seems 
comfortable. "I figure that people know themselves and their habits best, so I 
let them decide what to do," he said. "If he gets that $8,000 refund in a lump 
sum and uses it for major purchases, that's better than getting it in monthly 
installments and spending it on everyday expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 If Johnston does decide to invest the money, Szekel said, he can understand 
the wariness about mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are popular, but they do have some risk -- as we are seeing right now in 
the municipal bond funds," which have been shaken by Orange County's loss of 
more than $2 billion from its investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Szekel said, Johnston and Rollyson "seem to have excellent 
debt-to-earnings ratios. . . . It really boils down to a matter of saving it or 
spending it, and that's a decision only they can make."

WATCHING THE PESO, WAITING FOR BARGAINS; CRISIS: DOUBLING OF KEY SHORT-TERM 
RATE SEEN AS STRONG SIGNAL THAT GOVERNMENT IS SERIOUS ABOUT RETAINING FOREIGN 
CAPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mexican government on Wednesday doubled a key short-term interest rate in 
a drastic bid to retain foreign investors, amid reports that the embattled 
nation has lost $8 billion in capital since its financial crisis erupted last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The higher rate -- along with reports that Mexico was negotiating with U.S. 
Treasury officials for emergency loans of up to $10 billion to quell the crisis 
-- helped the peso on Wednesday regain some of the value it had lost since its 
devaluation sparked the crisis nine days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The capital flight, equal to more than 12% of foreign investment in Mexico's 
financial system, could lead to inflation as high as 20% and plunge the Mexican 
economy into recession, economists said. The continued loss of foreign capital 
could also require the government to adopt strict slow-growth measures next 
year at a time when Mexican consumers were expecting a respite from six years 
of austerity. 
</P>
<P>
 To stem the capital outflow, the Mexican government on Wednesday raised 
interest rate yields on 28-day cetes, Mexican government bonds roughly 
equivalent to short-term U.S. Treasury bills. The rate was hiked by 15 
percentage points at the weekly government auction to 31%, the highest level in 
nearly five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate hike was interpreted as a strong signal that the government is 
willing to go to great lengths to attract and keep foreign capital. More than 
half the cetes in past auctions have been bought by foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 The peso closed Wednesday about 4.9750 to the dollar, an almost 10% gain from 
its 5.50 close late Tuesday, although it is still down more than 30% since Dec. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican stocks and bonds also rallied amid reports of the possible emergency 
credit. Mexico's benchmark Bolsa index rose 60.82 points, or 2.67%, to close at 
2,337.72 on Wednesday, and some individual stocks made huge gains. 
</P>
<P>
 The peso's partial recovery had been predicted by some who thought sellers 
overreacted to the Mexican government's announcement last week that it would 
allow the peso to float freely in value against the dollar. John Williamson, a 
fellow at the Institute for International Economics, predicted Wednesday that 
the peso could bounce back to as low as 4 per dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 But the capital flight report and the spike in interest rates were ominous 
signs, and they raised fears of a replay of the 1982 peso devaluation, when a 
sinking currency, sharply rising interest rates and spiraling inflation caused 
a wholesale exodus of capital from Mexico to offshore havens. 
</P>
<P>
 The short-term practical effect of capital flight and loss of foreign investor 
confidence is an unstable currency: The Mexican government has diminished 
foreign reserves at its disposal to try to prop up the peso. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher interest rates carry risks. The yields ultimately will be reflected in 
bank loans and passed on to Mexican consumers and businesses. By increasing the 
costs of many products and services, sustained high rates initially will create 
intense inflationary pressure, said Mauro Leos, vice president of operation at 
Ciemex/Wefa, a Philadelphia think tank that tracks foreign capital in and out 
of Mexico. High rates later could slow the economy by inhibiting spending and 
prompting people to save instead of spend. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are awaiting an economic plan to be released Monday by new President 
Ernesto Zedillo, who has been blamed for badly bungling the first Mexican 
devaluation in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The flight of $8 billion from Mexico's financial system since early last week 
was estimated by Ciemex/Wefa and corroborated by Carlos Zarazaga, a senior 
economist at the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve Bank. He said the outflow 
was equal to the amount of all new foreign investment that came into Mexico 
during 1994, thus wiping out any net gain. 
</P>
<P>
 The drain was caused by foreigners and Mexicans selling stocks and bonds and 
exchanging the peso proceeds for dollars, Leos said. The drain, combined with 
what the Mexican government has spent in recent months to defend its peso, has 
left the country with less than $6 billion in foreign reserves, down from $28 
billion in March, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic reduction in the Mexican government's reserves is what is 
spurring its efforts to arrange a credit line with the United States, Canada 
and the International Monetary Fund. The credit would give Mexico the resources 
it needs to begin defending and staking out a value for the peso, Leos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dwindling of foreign reserves was a principal reason for the devaluation. 
The government was also motivated by a desire to reverse its growing balance of 
payments deficit. By devaluing its currency, Mexico makes its goods more 
attractive on the international market. 
</P>
<P>
 Other side effects of shrinking foreign investment -- in a country that relies 
on foreign capital as heavily as Mexico does -- include a shrinkage in the 
money supply, a drop-off in spending by consumers and rising unemployment. Less 
capital means higher interest rates on loans taken out by credit-hungry 
borrowers, Zarazaga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capital flight "is extremely serious," Leos said. "It leaves the central bank 
with no power to influence the foreign exchange markets. It creates uncertainty 
in the outlook for economy in general because of the unstable currency. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, we have a crisis not only in that the currency is devalued but also 
because of the uncertainty about what the reference level is." 
</P>
<P>
 To stabilize things, he said, Mexico urgently needs a credit agreement with 
U.S., Canadian and international funding sources, because Mexico "doesn't have 
the internal resources to (defend its currency) on its own." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after measures are taken, Mexico's leaders will have a tough task 
restoring trust among foreign investors -- and Mexican citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people thought things like this were not supposed to happen, now 
that Mexico was part of NAFTA and after the sacrifices that were done in the 
last six to 10 years," Leos said.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: IGNORANCE IS BLISS IN THE HIGH-TECH MARKETPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Intel now promises to replace its flawed Pentiums for anyone who asks; 
Calgene's genetically engineered FlavrSavr tomato finally enjoys modest 
regional sales; Microsoft's oft-delayed Windows 95 operating system is 
threatening to become a "misnumer"; more than a million "newbies" a month are 
logging on to the Internet, and personal computer sales this Christmas leaped 
by an estimated one-third over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 These 1994 events all reflect a rapidly evolving market force that's fast 
assumed the momentum of a techno-tsunami. It's relentless and unstoppable, 
through 1995 and beyond. For better and worse, it's now actively rewriting the 
rules of American innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely five years ago, high-tech innovation was primarily shaped by customers 
who were demanding because they knew an awful lot. Today's customers are so 
demanding precisely because they don't know an awful lot -- and don't want to. 
Market ignorance -- not market information -- is now the dominant driver of 
technological innovation. That's why an Intel has to promise to replace its 
Pentiums and a Microsoft delays release of its long-awaited operating system: 
They now have customers who don't care to deal with vendor bugs and glitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, that's why a Calgene has to constantly assure consumers that its 
genetically engineered FlavrSavrs aren't "Frankenfoods" that will undermine 
their precious bodily fluids, but rather tasty tomatoes that don't rot quite as 
quickly. Managing consumer ignorance becomes even more important than providing 
a quality innovation. Indeed, effectively managing consumer ignorance has now 
become indistinguishable from managing quality innovation. The trick is turning 
the abject ignorance of the marketplace from an albatross-like liability into a 
valued asset. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, for example, IBM's most recent television ads for its personal 
computers. The ads don't show the computers at all. Instead, they feature a 
spokes-comedian talking about the fact that IBM service representatives will 
answer the phone on the first ring and won't put you on hold. The implicit 
message? Hey, don't worry about the manual or any of that stuff -- you got a 
problem, just call us and we'll talk you through it . Abysmal ignorance is thus 
transformed into a market opportunity. Or as they say in the software biz, "Try 
to turn a bug into a feature." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, practically every PC company or software house will tell you that 
customer support is the fastest-growing -- and most demanding -- part of its 
business. One PC company estimates that it'll get at least one customer support 
call for every computer it sells. Customer support, however, tends to be 
time-consuming and expensive. As a customer base expands, customer support 
costs skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, this provides a tremendous economic incentive to design 
systems that are easy to use and understand and require little or no follow-up 
support. In essence, the high-tech marketplace is now being driven to figure 
out clever ways to meet the needs and pander to uninformed consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Lynch, the extraordinary stock picker who managed Fidelity's 
astonishingly successful Magellan mutual fund, once remarked that he preferred 
to invest in "good companies that any fool could run, because eventually some 
fool will." The same ethic, it seems, is now holding true for the design of 
high technologies: Design them so any fool can use or consume them.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically -- even perversely -- perhaps one of the biggest competitive 
advantages our high-technology companies possess is a busy, ill-informed, 
stressed-out, convenience-seeking mass marketplace. To wit, if we were all 
exceptionally well-educated, the need to design an easy and accessible personal 
computer interface wouldn't be nearly as strong.  
</P>
<P>
 But because so many people lack the time, interest and wherewithal to learn 
sophisticated interfaces, the hardware, software and telecommunications 
companies are forced to invest in simplicity. Consequently, everyone reaps the 
benefits of these simple but powerful computer tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, such ignorance and lust for convenience is a global phenomenon, so 
if such products can succeed in America, they're well-positioned to succeed 
overseas.  
</P>
<P>
 It seems oddly appropriate that the keys to America's high-tech success rely 
both on incredibly well-informed people who demand the best tools available and 
on people who have neither the time nor the temperament to invest in learning 
about new technologies. Our ignorance turns out to be just as competitive a 
weapon as our intellect in the global marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, a new balance is being struck for innovators who want to succeed 
worldwide. If this year offers any guide to next, it's certain that 
ignorance-driven innovation promises to surpass information-driven innovation 
as an essential skill.

FIRST-EVER DEAL TO BUILD APPLE MAC 'CLONES' ANNOUNCED; COMPUTERS: VENTURE BY 
START-UP POWER COMPUTING IS BACKED BY OLIVETTI OF ITALY. MACINTOSH FANS HAIL 
NEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending a long and anxious wait for fans of the famed Apple Macintosh personal 
computer, a California start-up with backing from Olivetti of Italy on 
Wednesday announced the first-ever agreement to build Macintosh "clones." 
</P>
<P>
 Power Computing Corp., based southeast of San Francisco in Milpitas, said it 
will sell Macintosh machines under its own label and also make components and 
complete systems for other companies. The first clones are expected to be 
shipped in March, said Stephen Kahng, a well-known Silicon Valley computer 
designer who is president and chief executive of Power Computing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahng would not disclose prices, but the Mac clones are likely to be slightly 
cheaper than Macs from Apple Computer though still a bit more expensive than 
IBM-compatible PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple enthusiasts hailed the news, saying attractive clones at reasonable 
prices should help the Cupertino, Calif., company in its effort to wrest market 
share from the industry's dominant players, Intel and Microsoft. Machines based 
on Intel microprocessors and running Microsoft operating systems and software 
have captured about 80% of the worldwide PC market, compared to about 10% for 
Apple. 
</P>
<P>
 A March launch date would be several months sooner than expected. Don 
Strickland, Apple's vice president of licensing, said in September that clones 
running the Macintosh operating system probably will not be available until the 
end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Power Computing's aggressive launch plan bodes well for the overall Mac 
market, said Pieter Hartsook, editor of the Hartsook Letter, an Alameda 
newsletter that tracks Macintosh developments. He said his chief reservation is 
that 13-month-old Power Computing is an unknown with no brand identity, but he 
noted that that could also work to Apple's advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kahng has a history (in Silicon Valley) and no competing market, so the 
company can focus all of its resources on building Mac clones," Hartsook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some expect Apple to eventually reach licensing deals with major industry 
players, possibly including Motorola and IBM, Apple's partners in the 
development of the new PowerPC microprocessor. But Apple, which resisted 
licensing of any sort for years, is trying to walk a thin line by allowing 
clones while still retaining the ability to sell its own hardware profitably. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahng, 45, said he was attracted to the Macintosh because of the speedy new 
PowerPC chip. "We felt PowerPC is a new technology with very good potential," 
he said, adding, "I am staking our existence" on the Mac clones. Prototypes 
will be demonstrated at the MacWorld exposition starting next Wednesday in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahng, who was born in Seoul, came to the United States 25 years ago. He 
studied computer science and electrical engineering in Michigan, receiving a 
master's degree in science from the University of Michigan in computer 
engineering. He has since been involved in a variety of computer ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 His former company, Up to Date Technology, designed the Leading Edge personal 
computer for Daewoo Corp. of South Korea. He was later a senior executive at 
Chips & Technologies, which played a big role in the development of the IBM 
clone market. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivetti, one the biggest computer firms in Europe, owns "less than 50%" of 
Power Computing, Kahng said. He said he is in discussion with other potential 
corporate and venture capital investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple's Strickland said Power Computing would help speed additional clones to 
market by supplying components to other licensees. He added that Apple's and 
IBM's recently announced plan to develop a common hardware standard in 1996 
that would run a variety of operating systems has sparked new interest in Mac 
OS licensing. 
</P>
<P>
 Once that platform becomes available, Strickland noted, clone manufacturers 
would have to license only the Mac operating system software, not Apple's 
proprietary hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 Since unveiling the Macintosh a decade ago, Apple has won a strong following 
among desktop publishers and others who crave ease of use and outstanding 
graphics. Indeed, many in the computer world have always considered the Mac 
vastly superior to PCs that use Intel chips and Microsoft software. But Apple 
charged premium prices, and the vast majority of PC users gravitated toward the 
less expensive, IBM-style machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of Microsoft Windows 3.0 operating system four years ago eroded 
much of Apple's user-friendly advantage. Yet Apple still declined to license 
its technology to manufacturers that would have produced less expensive clones. 
That failure, many analysts say, has cost Apple dearly in terms of lost 
opportunities to build market share. 
</P>
<P>
 Among others reportedly negotiating licensing agreements with Apple are 
Toshiba and Pioneer Electronic, both of Japan, Motorola, Goldstar Technology of 
Korea and Radius.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: IRS DELIVERING ITS OWN NEW YEAR'S 
GREETINGS; TAXES: IN ONE OF SEVERAL KEY PROCEDURAL CHANGES, AGENCY WILL START 
CROSS-CHECKING ALL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS TO BATTLE TAX FRAUD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its annual effort to send its own version of holiday greetings, the 
Internal Revenue Service promised Wednesday that your first batch of New Year's 
mail will include a 1994 tax form. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the new forms are not substantially different than the 1993 
versions, the agency is enacting several procedural changes that could have a 
substantial impact on taxpayers, IRS chief Margaret Milner Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 86 million tax booklets and 23 million postcards are scheduled to be 
pushed into mailboxes Jan. 3 -- the first working day of 1995. Some eager post 
offices have already put packages in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Because few tax changes took effect during 1994, the forms are largely 
familiar. Only retirees, low-income families, employees with unreimbursed 
business expenses and a handful of lucky investors will face noteworthy 
changes, IRS officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in one of several key procedural changes, the agency will start 
cross-checking Social Security numbers for every taxpayer and dependent on the 
form -- part of an effort to battle tax fraud, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Returns containing inaccurate Social Security numbers will be held up until 
the discrepancies can be corrected. No refunds will be processed in the 
interim, said Frank Keith, IRS spokesman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, these issues were resolved after the refund was issued in 
classic audit fashion," Keith said. "Now even a careless error could hold up 
your refund. We are trying to stress that taxpayers should take this time to 
verify their Social Security numbers and those of their dependents." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the IRS is making electronic and telephone tax filing more widely 
available and less expensive, Richardson said. Already, about 15.5 million 
taxpayers file their returns via computer, mainly because filing electronically 
can cut refund waiting time in half. Whereas it takes between six and eight 
weeks to get a refund when you file by mail, the IRS promises your money within 
21 days when you file electronically. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in the past you generally had to go to private tax preparers, who 
charged between $35 and $50 to transmit the returns. (A handful of preparers 
transmitted them free, but often only if you paid to have your taxes prepared.) 
</P>
<P>
 This year, about 126 IRS offices -- including the main L.A. office at 300 N. 
Los Angeles St. -- will provide free electronic filing services. Simply go in 
with your W-2 forms and other information and fill out the forms on the IRS 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, many Voluntary Income Tax Assistance programs, which are offered 
to low-income and elderly taxpayers, will have electronic filing capabilities 
on site -- also free for the asking. 
</P>
<P>
 However, to reduce foot traffic at peak filing times, some IRS offices will 
restrict the free electronic filing to low-income taxpayers or those who can 
qualify for the earned-income tax credit, spokesman Keith said. Roughly 40 IRS 
offices offered free electronic filing services last year. 
</P>
<P>
 To find a VITA program or an IRS office that offers free electronic filing, 
call (800) TAX-1040. But plan to file early. IRS officials expect to be swamped 
in the few weeks before the April deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has also expanded its telephone-based filing program, called 
TeleFile, Richardson said. The system allows you to file a 1040-EZ form over 
the phone in about three to four minutes. Like electronic filing, it promises 
faster refunds and greater accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, previously available in only seven states -- Florida, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina and West Virginia -- has been expanded 
to Northern California, southern Texas and all of Colorado.  
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for TeleFile, you must file a 1040-EZ form and live at the same 
location you did last year -- in one of the qualifying districts. If you 
qualify, you should expect to get a special package that includes instructions 
and a personal identification number. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Tax Forms: What's New 
</P>
<P>
 * 1040-EZ expanded: The nation's simplest tax form has been expanded to allow 
low-income parents to claim the earned income tax credit. In the past, you 
couldn't use this form if you had dependents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earned income tax credit: This lucrative credit was expanded last year to 
allow non-parents to claim it. The form has also been abbreviated, to six lines 
instead of 20. 
</P>
<P>
 * Itemized deductions: Schedule A now includes lines to list personal property 
taxes and tax-preparation fees. Previously, these items had to be written in by 
hand. Taxpayers are also required to provide substantiation, such as a receipt 
or acknowledgment, for any charitable contributions over $250. 
</P>
<P>
 * Capital gains: Capital gains distributions this year will no longer be 
entered on the 1040, unless they're not filing a Schedule D. Those who don't 
file the capital gains and losses form should report capital gains on Line 13 
of the 1040 and handwrite "CGD" on the dotted line. 
</P>
<P>
 * Social Security: Single retirees earning more than $34,000 a year and 
married couples earning more than $44,000 must pay additional taxes. Retirees 
will have to fill out a new 18-line work sheet -- separate from the 1040 -- to 
calculate the taxable portion of their Social Security income.

NO MORE BUTTS ABOUT IT; STATEWIDE NO-SMOKING LAW COMES IN WITH NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On New Year's Day, one of the nation's toughest anti-smoking laws takes effect 
in California. Lighting up will be banned in most enclosed workplaces and 
virtually all restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 While health groups and others have praised the ban as a victory in the fight 
against the dangers of secondhand smoke, some business groups say the new 
statute is vague and will give employers headaches. And it is not universally 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer offering a choice," said Craig Gilbert, manager of Antonello 
Ristorante in Santa Ana, which has separate dining rooms for smokers and 
nonsmokers. "A lot of our clientele enjoys smoking. Maybe now they'll just have 
to go outside to smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 The new law will have a greater effect in many suburban and rural areas of 
Southern California than in Los Angeles. The city already requires restaurants 
to be free of smoke. Suburban and rural areas generally have not been as 
aggressive in prohibiting smoking in restaurants and other public places. 
</P>
<P>
 The new state law will apply in all cities except those that have stricter 
ordinances. Smoking will be allowed in bars, including those in restaurants, 
but only until Jan. 1, 1997. And new federal or state clean-air regulations 
could move up that compliance date. 
</P>
<P>
 That uncertainty and other aspects of the new law are troubling to some 
business operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Reeves, director of industrial safety and health at the California Chamber 
of Commerce, said the law requires employers to post "clear and prominent" 
no-smoking signs, "but it gives no requirements on signage." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Health Services, which lobbied for passage of the 
law, said the state is working with local governments to educate employers 
about the new requirements, including details such as signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an enthusiasm in California for smoke-free work sites," said Colleen 
Stevens, an analyst with the health department in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 She said California's law is the strongest of its kind in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides bars, other places exempted from the ban are gaming clubs, cabs of 
trucks, most rooms and lobby areas in hotels, large warehouses in which 20 or 
fewer employees work, and businesses that employ five or fewer workers who all 
agree to allow smoking and where minors are not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant industry, however, has been at the center of the debate over 
smoking and will probably feel the broadest and most costly impact from the 
law, which Gov. Pete Wilson signed in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether voluntarily or because of local ordinances, more and more workplaces 
in the state have banned smoking in recent years. Many restaurant operators, to 
avoid losing customers, have maintained smoking areas whenever they could. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Restaurant Assn. said it supported the no-smoking legislation 
largely because it felt that a uniform ordinance would put all restaurants on 
equal competitive footing.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the playing field will be leveled," said Stan Kyker, the 
association's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when Sacramento enacted a workplace and restaurant smoking ban 
about two years ago, "we clearly lost business to two similar coffee shops just 
two blocks away outside the city limit," said a senior executive at Family 
Restaurants Inc., the Irvine company that operates 200 Coco's and Carrows in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you don't have to go two blocks away," said the executive, who asked not 
to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new law, he said, could cost the company business anyway if smokers 
decide to eat out less often because they can't light up in a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyker of the restaurant association said that probably won't happen on a large 
scale, because most people have become accustomed to smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 As of June, 72 cities in California had laws specifying that workplaces must 
be 100% smoke-free, and 91 cities had ordinances prohibiting smoking in 
restaurants, according to California Smoke-Free Cities, a nonprofit group based 
in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, Pasadena, Long Beach and Santa Monica are among the 
cities that already prohibit smoking in restaurants, workplaces or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Several cities in Orange County, including Laguna Beach, Huntington Beach and 
Laguna Hills, prohibit smoking in restaurants, but none has such an ordinance 
for the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's largest cities, Anaheim and Santa Ana included, do not have 
100% smoking bans for restaurants, according to the June report. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcement of the statewide ban is expected to be handled by local law 
agencies or health departments. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time violators will be fined $100; repeat offenders may be fined up to 
$500. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Where You Can Still Smoke 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Sunday, state law prohibits smoking in most enclosed workplaces in 
California. An enclosed workplace can be broadly defined as any place of 
employment, including offices and restaurants, that has four walls and a 
ceiling. The following places are specifically excluded from AB 13 but may be 
regulated by local governments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Small businesses (five or fewer employees), when all four of the following 
conditions are met: 
</P>
<P>
 The smoking area is not accessible to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 No employees are required to work in smoking area against their will. 
</P>
<P>
 Air from smoking area is vented directly to outside of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Employer complies with all applicable state and federal ventilation standards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gaming clubs, bars and taverns are exempt until Jan. 1, 1997, unless state 
or federal agencies set smoke-limiting standards for such places sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sixty-five percent of hotel and motel guest rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Designated portions of hotel and motel lobbies. In large lobbies, smoking 
area can cover up to 25% of entire space. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meeting and banquet rooms in hotels, motels, restaurants and convention 
centers, except when used for exhibit purposes or when meals are being served. 
During these times, smoking may be permitted in corridors or anterooms if no 
employee is stationed there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Warehouses with more than 100,000 square feet of floor space and 20 or fewer 
full-time employees. Does not apply to any office space within a warehouse, 
which must be kept smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tobacco shops and attached private smokers' lounges. 
</P>
<P>
 * Employee break rooms designated for smoking, under strict ventilation rules 
like those for small businesses, listed above. 
</P>
<P>
 * Truck cabs and tractors, when a nonsmoking employee is not present. 
</P>
<P>
 * Private residences, except when used as a licensed child-care facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other exceptions: 
</P>
<P>
 Theatrical production sites, if critical to the production. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical research or treatment sites, if necessary for research. 
</P>
<P>
 Patient smoking areas of long-term health-care facilities. What Employers Need 
to Do 
</P>
<P>
 The state law, called AB 13, requires specific actions on the part of 
employers to ensure the safety of all employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * If building is entirely smoke-free, employer must clearly post "No Smoking" 
signs at each building entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 * If building has a designated smoking area, signs stating "Smoking Is 
Prohibited Except in Designated Areas" must be clearly posted at each building 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 * If non-employee is seen smoking in the enclosed work area, employer must ask 
that individual to refrain from doing so.

PLUNGING PESO YET TO TRIGGER TOURISM BOOM; CURRENCY: U.S. BARGAIN HUNTERS ARE 
DISAPPOINTED TO FIND PRICES OF TRAVEL PACKAGES TO MEXICO HAVEN'T DROPPED MUCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The plunging value of the Mexican peso has yet to trigger any dramatic 
increases in tourist travel, and the bargains that many travelers expected are 
proving harder to find, according to many travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
 American bargain hunters have been disappointed to find that the 
dollar-denominated prices of many popular package tours, airline tickets and 
rooms at large hotel chains have not budged since the peso has lost roughly 40% 
of its value in the past week. Many tour companies have already set prices for 
next year and are not expected to change them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting an awful lot of calls as to whether our rates are going down," 
said Ken Phillips, a spokesman for Pleasant Mexico Holidays, a Westlake 
Village-based tour operator. "The answer is no. That's because all the 
contracts -- with hotels and airlines -- are fixed in U.S. dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico was already popular among U.S. tourists even before the peso's fall, 
say travel agents who reported strong bookings for Mexican resorts this winter. 
In the long run, many travel industry experts see the cheaper peso as helping 
Mexico remain competitive with other low-cost destinations such as the 
Caribbean and Hawaii.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the devaluation, some Mexican hotel and tourist groups reported a 
significant increase in calls from Americans. "The last two days have been 
tremendously busy," said Gina Cord, whose travel company represents about 30 
hotels in Baja California.  
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, travel agents, hotel chains and airlines have seen no 
dramatic change in their Mexico business. Most consumers have been too busy 
with the Christmas holiday to have noticed the peso's plunge, travel agents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has not been an immediate impact," said Barb Hamberger, a spokeswoman 
for Minneapolis-based Carlson Travel Network, one of nation's largest travel 
agencies. "People are not thinking about (Mexico) at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest bargains await those savvy, independent travelers who convert 
their dollars to pesos to pay for hotel, food and merchandise.  
</P>
<P>
 The cheaper peso means guests at the 300-room Hyatt Regency hotel in Merida, 
Mexico, will pay $65 a night for a room instead of $120 if they convert their 
dollars to pesos. But most guests at the hotel on the Yucatan Peninsula have 
paid in advance in dollars through travel agents and, as a result, won't see 
any savings in their hotel bills, said general manager Eduardo Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the contracts for rooms with international travel agents are done on 
a dollar basis," he said. "They would get a better deal if they converted their 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 But even that strategy will become less lucrative as hotels, restaurants, gift 
shops and other tourist-related businesses raise their peso prices. For now, 
most hotels are abiding by a government request to freeze rates for at least 30 
days. After that, however, rates will probably rise if the peso remains 
depressed, travel experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 If travel to Mexico remains strong next year, many wholesalers that sell hotel 
rooms, tours and other services to travel agents may keep some of the savings 
that resulted from a cheaper peso, said Kathy Traynor, a travel agent for 
Associated Travel in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're thinking in terms of a bigger profit," she said.

 AirTouch-Led Group Wins Spanish License: The Airtel Group won the bidding to 
set up a private cellular telephone system, where it will compete directly with 
the existing cellular system operated by the state-controlled 
telecommunications company Telefonica, said Jose Borrel, Minister for Public 
Works and Transportation.Airtel includes British Telecommunications and Spanish 
partners Banco Santander, Banco Central Hispano, the utilities Union Fenosa and 
Fecsa and the builder Cubiertas. San Francisco-based AirTouch is a cellular 
phone company that was spun off by Pacific Telesis early this year. Airtel had 
bid $640 million for the license. That made the cellular license the most 
expensive to be auctioned in Europe.

 Bank of New York to Buy BankAmerica's ADR Business: The company said it will 
acquire the American depositary receipts business of BankAmerica Corp. for an 
undisclosed price.The acquisition fits Bank of New York's strategy of buying 
businesses that can easily be absorbed by the bank's securities-processing 
business and add to profit quickly. Executives earlier this month said annual 
revenue from securities processing will rise in double digits, in part from 
acquisitions. Bank of New York said the BankAmerica purchase is expected to 
close by the end of the week and add to 1994 earnings immediately.

 Fleet Financial to Buy Back Stake in Mortgage Unit: In an about-face, Fleet 
Financial Group said it wants to buy back for $190 million the 19% of Fleet 
Mortgage Group it spun off to the public in 1992. Fleet sold the stake two 
years ago when the mortgage refinancing business was booming and mortgage 
companies appeared to be an attractive investment.But rising interest rates 
have squelched demand for refinancings and new home loans and mortgage company 
stocks have plummeted, making them takeover targets. Fleet Mortgage's shares 
have fallen 18% during the past three months. Fleet's offer of $20 a share in 
cash, announced after the markets closed, is $3 a share less than what buyers 
paid in the August, 1992, spinoff.

Meanwhile, the proportion of bulls rose to 35.3% from 34.2% the previous week. 
The percentage of advisers expecting a short-term decline in the market rose to 
14.7% from 11.1% the previous week.

STOCKBROKER CHARGED WITH FRAUD BY SEC; SECURITIES: INVESTIGATION FOCUSES ON 
DEALERS WHO ALLEGEDLY DUPED MUNICIPAL INVESTORS INTO HIGH-RISK DERIVATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed civil fraud charges against a 
stockbroker in connection with an investigation focusing on Houston securities 
dealers who allegedly duped municipal agencies into making high-risk 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 While unrelated to the SEC's investigation of possible wrongdoing in Orange 
County's bankruptcy, the case underscores the agency's broad concern about 
unscrupulous securities dealers who may be preying on municipal finance 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Named in the complaint filed this week by the Chicago office of the SEC is 
Kenneth J. Schulte, a stockbroker who formerly worked in Houston for Hart 
Securities and Murchison Investment Bankers. He currently works in Boca Raton, 
Fla., for Comprehensive Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint focuses on allegedly improper sales practices by Schulte 
involving 14 client municipalities and school districts in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were investments that were totally inappropriate for municipalities 
that were being recommended by a broker who knew that they were inappropriate 
and who then lied about what the investments are," said Mary E. Keefe, regional 
director of the SEC in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Keefe said, Schulte led municipal officials to believe in some 
cases that they were putting their money into low-risk U.S. government-backed 
securities when, in fact, they were buying high-risk derivative investments. In 
other cases, Schulte allegedly misled investors about the risk of the 
sophisticated investments they were buying, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its complaint, the SEC said Schulte traded in mortgage-backed derivative 
investments known as interest-only securities, or IOs, inverse IOs and inverse 
floaters. These are complex securities designed to pay out more in interest as 
rates fall -- and, conversely, less if rates rise, as they did throughout 1994. 
In fact, Orange County sustained heavy losses by investing in inverse floaters. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC officials said their investigation is continuing into "various individuals 
and entities," which are believed to include the three brokerage firms for whom 
Schulte has worked since the spring of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulte, reached at his home in Delray Beach, Fla., declined to comment other 
than to say he did no business with municipalities in California. He referred 
questions to Paul S. Francis, a Houston lawyer representing his former 
employer, Hart Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis said an internal probe of Schulte's activities while working for Hart 
from June to December, 1991, turned up no wrongdoing. During Schulte's stint 
with Hart, Francis added, Schulte sold IOs but not the other types of 
investments cited in the SEC complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on our investigation, we believe he did adequately disclose the 
characteristics of the IOs, including their risks, and faithfully executed the 
purchases and sales requested by the customers," Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the SEC subpoenaed records involving Schulte's transactions in 
mid-1994. Francis said Hart also has received "inquiries" from the National 
Assn. of Securities Dealers and securities regulators in Texas and Missouri 
about related matters. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC officials said the total losses suffered by the Ohio agencies has not been 
determined. The agency, however, said it traced $7.5 million in investments 
that four of the municipal investors made through Schulte, and that $3.4 
million -- roughly 45% -- was lost.

U.S. COMPANIES EDGE OUT JAPAN IN VEHICLE PRODUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in 15 years, auto makers built more cars, trucks and 
minivans in the United States than in Japan, according to estimates released 
Wednesday by Ward's Automotive Reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit-based trade publication said U.S. auto output totaled 12.2 million 
units in 1994, up from 10.9 million in 1993. That compares with an estimated 11 
million vehicles built in Japan this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts attribute the turnaround to the growing popularity of domestic 
vehicles, particularly trucks, and increased auto output from so-called 
Japanese transplant factories here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly the auto industry is booming, and the transplants are building a lot 
more vehicles here than before," one analyst said. "The Big Three are also 
cranking out the trucks." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese car companies have been shifting production to the United States to 
offset the effects of the slumping dollar against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 The move has allowed Japanese car makers to increase their share of the U.S. 
vehicle market slightly through the first 11 months of the year, to 23.3% from 
23.1% a year ago, as transplant factories were able to maintain production 
while several Big Three plants were shut down for model changeovers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, Ward's estimated, Japanese transplant factories will account for 
about 17.3% of all vehicles built in the United States, Canada and Mexico, up 
from 16% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift is likely to continue for several years as Japanese companies such 
as Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. expand their presence in North 
America, and European car makers such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW establish a 
beachhead in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda has already announced plans to build an additional 110,000 cars at 
plants in Ohio and Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota recently announced it will stop shipping compact pickup trucks to the 
United States from Japan and instead will build them at a joint-venture factory 
with General Motors Corp. in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan Motor Co. plans to start shipping about 2,000 Nissan Sentra cars from 
Mexico next year, eliminating the need for more costly exports from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expect U.S. car and truck sales to rise about 9% this year to about 
15.4 million vehicles. Ward's estimated the shift to North American factories 
pushed total output in the United States, Mexico and Canada to a record 15.75 
million vehicles, with trucks, minivans and sport utility vehicles accounting 
for a record 47.3% of total sales. In 1992, North American output totaled 12.8 
million vehicles, 41.6% of them trucks.

JUSTICE'S ANTITRUST DIVISION PROBES PAPER PRODUCT SALES; COMMERCE: FEDERAL 
INVESTIGATORS DEMAND DOCUMENTS ON PRICING AND DISTRIBUTION PRACTICES FROM 1990 
TO 1994. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Some of America's biggest paper companies have been contacted by Justice 
Department investigators as part of a federal antitrust investigation into 
commercial and industrial sales of toilet tissue and paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies that received demands for documents in recent weeks include Georgia 
Pacific Corp., James River Corp., Scott Paper Co., Fort Howard Corp. and 
Chesapeake Corp. The civil investigative demands ask for information about 
pricing and distribution practices during the period from 1990 to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department confirmed Wednesday that investigators are probing 
possible restraint of trade in paper sales. News of the investigation was first 
reported last week by Bloomberg Business News. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at the possibility of anti-competitive practices in the 
sanitary paper industry," said Gina Talamona, spokeswoman for the department's 
Antitrust Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Weidman, a spokeswoman for Atlanta-based Georgia Pacific, said the 
department request is "fairly broad in scope about the commercial side of our 
tissue business." She said the company has been told that the federal inquiry 
is preliminary in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 In Richmond, Va., James River Corp. spokesman John Burke said investigators 
sought information about "our sales and pricing of sanitary paper products sold 
to the industrial and commercial markets -- hotels, offices and that kind of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 A memo distributed to executives at Richmond-based Chesapeake Corp. said 
authorities asked for information about pricing practices by the firm's 
Wisconsin Tissue subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Greta Thomson, a spokeswoman at Scott Paper's Philadelphia headquarters, also 
confirmed receipt of a federal demand for documents. Fort Howard Corp. in Green 
Bay, Wis., acknowledged its inclusion in the investigation in a filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Kimberly-Clark Co. in Dallas did not return calls seeking 
comment.

UPJOHN STOPS DRUG TRIALS AFTER DEATHS; PHARMACEUTICALS: FREEDOX IS CONSIDERED 
CRUCIAL TO THE FIRM'S FUTURE. THE HIGHER MORTALITY RATE IS UNEXPLAINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tests on humans of a drug considered crucial to Upjohn Co.'s future have been 
suspended because of unexplained deaths among some American patients, the 
company announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Upjohn, based in Kalamazoo, Mich., said it suspended the clinical trials of 
the drug Freedox for treatment of head injuries on the recommendation of an 
independent safety board. 
</P>
<P>
 The trials, which were 98% under way, showed a higher rate of mortality among 
patients who took the drug compared to patients who received a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of people who died wasn't revealed, because doing so would skew the 
ongoing study of patients who have already received the drug, said Betsy Adams, 
a Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stopping these clinical trials was the cautious and appropriate safety 
measure," she said. "But it's much too soon to say whether anything is wrong 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Upjohn fell $1.375 to $30.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, and 
industry analysts said the development could hasten the long-expected takeover 
of the weakened drug maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedox is the most promising drug being developed by Upjohn, which has been 
hurt recently by the expiration of patents on its key drugs, forcing them to 
compete against cheaper generic brands. Those drugs include Xanax, an 
anti-anxiety drug; Halcion, a sleeping pill, and Ansaid, a painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
 "This drug was going to be the driver of Upjohn through the 1990s," NatWest 
Securities analyst Jack Lamberton said. "The projection was already bleak and 
is going to get much bleaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Freedox, whose generic name is tirilazad mesylate, is also intended to treat 
strokes and related bleeding in the brain, but the FDA has hesitated granting 
approval for such treatment, saying test results have been inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths in the tests for head injuries came from brain swelling and 
herniation typical in such patients, the company said.

 Merry-Go-Round Enterprises to Close More Stores: The Joppa, Md.-based clothing 
retailer, which has closed 200 stores since it declared bankruptcy in January, 
said it will close 200 others by February.The sales will leave the chain with 
about 1,000 outlets. The number of jobs that may be cut was not disclosed. It 
was the first major move since two executives joined Merry-Go-Round last month 
from Meridian Ventures, a turnaround investment firm that worked on the 
bankruptcy reorganization of R.H. Macy & Co. Merry-Go-Round shares closed 
unchanged at 69 cents on the New York Stock Exchange after dipping to 63 cents, 
an all-time low.

 Texaco Inc. Again Sued Over Rain Forest Damage: Peruvian rain forest dwellers 
filed a $1-billion lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York, alleging that 
the oil company spoiled their environment, lawyers for the plaintiffs said. 
Texaco is accused of dumping into rivers that flow from Ecuador to Peru and of 
designing its 400 wells in Ecuador knowing that millions of gallons of oil 
would end up in Peru.The suit also blames the oil company for a dramatically 
increased risk of cancer in the region. Earlier this week, the company said it 
asked a federal judge to dismiss a suit filed by several Ecuadorean Indian 
groups last year that sought $1.5 billion for rain forest damage. Texaco said 
it reached agreement with the Ecuadorean government to pay an unspecified 
amount.

 Sagan Lawsuit Thrown Out: Astronomer Carl Sagan's lawsuit against Apple 
Computer Inc., which used his name last year as a code name for a personal 
computer it was developing, has been dismissed, court papers show. U.S. 
District Judge Lourdes Baird found that Apple did not use the name to promote 
its mid-level PC, which was renamed and sold as Power Macintosh 7100/66.The 
code name was known only to employees and project developers sworn to secrecy, 
but it was leaked to the media. Baird dismissed the claims for copyright, 
unfair competition and right to publicity. The judge ruled that Apple did not 
libel Sagan when it changed the code name to "Butt-Head Astronomer."

FINANCIAL MARKETS; PROFIT TAKING CLIPS STOCKS AS DOLLAR FALLS AND YIELDS RISE 
</P>

 Blue-chip stocks snapped a four-day winning streak Wednesday, hurt by year-end 
profit taking, a drop in the dollar and a jump in long-term bond yields. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials fell 22.20 points to 3,839.49 after rising 94 points 
over the previous four sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U.S.-traded Mexican stocks rebounded sharply after Tuesday's 
selloff, though analysts say the outlook for the Mexican market remains 
troubled. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, U.S. stock and bond markets were unnerved by a sudden slump in 
the dollar, which fell amid speculation that Mexico may have drawn on 
multibillion-dollar lines of credit extended by the United States and Canada 
last week to halt the peso's slide. 
</P>
<P>
 By swapping pesos for dollars, Mexico would in effect shrink the supply of 
pesos -- boosting their value -- while creating a new supply of dollars in the 
market, thereby depressing the dollar's value. 
</P>
<P>
 As traders sold dollars on those supply worries Wednesday, the dollar fell to 
1.544 German marks in New York, down from 1.576 on Tuesday. It also fell to 
99.20 Japanese yen from 100.34. 
</P>
<P>
 But after trading had largely ended, a U.S. Treasury official denied that 
Mexico had tapped its dollar account with the United States. Nonetheless, the 
peso rebounded in value Wednesday, to about 4.98 to the dollar from 5.50 on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. bond market bore the brunt of the dollar's decline. Long-term bond 
yields have been falling in recent weeks, helped by signs of slowing economic 
growth and by expectations that foreign investors may find U.S. securities more 
attractive in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 A new decline in the dollar would revive inflation worries (by threatening 
higher prices on imports) and would discourage foreign investment, either of 
which would be negative for bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield, which sank to a three-month low of 7.76% 
on Tuesday, jumped to 7.83% by Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
 But yields on very short-term securities tumbled, which some traders said 
reflected a continuing "flight to quality" by nervous investors. The 
three-month T-bill yield dove to 5.61% from 5.78% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the broad market followed the Dow lower. Declining issues 
outnumbered advancing ones nearly 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange, though 
volume continued to be moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said clearer signs of the market's next big move -- up or down -- 
won't be visible until next week, after tax-related year-end trading games are 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S.-traded Mexican issues followed the Mexico City market higher after 
Tuesday's slide. In Mexico City, the Bolsa index gained 60.82 points, or 2.7%, 
to 2,337.72. 
</P>
<P>
 On the NYSE, Telmex surged 3 3/4 to 41 1/2, Vitro leaped 2 1/8 to 13 1/2, 
Empresas ICA gained 5/8 to 16 3/8 and Coca-Cola Femsa jumped 1 5/8 to 22 5/8. 
The Mexico Fund shot up 2 1/4 to 22 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other Latin markets were mixed. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Bovespa index 
rebounded 2% to close at 41,953, but Argentina's Merval index eased 0.1% to 
436.97 and Chile's IPSA index tumbled 1.3% to 140.49. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Wall Street, retail-related stocks led the market decline on 
disappointment over Christmas sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Toys R Us plunged 3 to 30 1/8 after a delayed opening, following reports that 
investment firm Wertheim Schroder & Co. had lowered its earnings estimates. 
Toys R Us declined to comment on its Christmas sales. 
</P>
<P>
 AnnTaylor fell 2 1/4 to 31 7/8 after Montgomery Securities said the apparel 
retailer might not meet its fourth-quarter profit goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Other retail stocks falling included Dayton Hudson, off 1 1/2 at 67 3/8; 
Sears, down 5/8 at 45 1/8, and Strouds, off 3/4 at 11. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks also came under renewed pressure. Ford fell 1/2 to 27 1/4, 
Chrysler fell 3/4 to 48 3/8 and GM eased 5/8 to 41 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some tech issues were hit by profit taking. Computer Sciences lost 1 5/8 to 
50 1/4, Lotus dropped 1/2 to 39 1/2, Autodesk gave up 1 to 39 3/4 and IBM fell 
1 1/4 to 73. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold stocks bucked the market trend as bullion prices rose, benefiting in 
part from the weaker dollar.  
</P>
<P>
 Near-term gold futures on the Comex gained $2.10 to $383.70 an ounce, and 
silver futures jumped 10.5 cents to $4.88 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Among gold miners, Santa Fe Pacific Gold rose 1/2 to 13 1/4, American Barrick 
added 7/8 to 22 5/8 and Placer Dome jumped 1 1/8 to 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other foreign markets, London's FTSE-100 index added 12.4 points to 
3,095.8 while Frankfurt's DAX index gained 2.86 points to 2,109.01. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo stocks ended lower, with the Nikkei-225 index off 45.83 points at 
19,665.53.

AT&T SEEKS RATE HIKES ON CARD, OPERATOR CALLS; TELECOM: REQUEST COMES AMID PUSH 
BY REGIONAL PHONE COMPANIES TO PROVIDE LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AT&T Corp., having just received federal approval to increase monthly 
long-distance rates, is seeking to raise other rates, including those for 
calling cards and operator-handled calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, filed Wednesday with the Federal Communications Commission, would 
generate $259 million in additional revenue for the telecommunications firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would affect far fewer callers than a rate increase for monthly 
long-distance service that went into effect Dec. 16, Joseph Nacchio, president 
of AT&T's Consumer Communications Services unit, said in an interview. He said 
exact figures were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T spokesman Jim McGann said inflation and increased costs of providing the 
services are prompting the request for higher rates. If approved, they will 
take effect Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional phone companies trying to get into the long-distance business contend 
that AT&T's plan underscores the need for more competition in the 
$60-billion-a-year industry. 
</P>
<P>
 All seven regional phone companies say they will work together to persuade 
Congress to let them into the long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also comes at a time when AT&T and rival MCI are in an advertising 
war over whose rates are lower. MCI, which requested an increase in its monthly 
rates, declined to comment. Sprint had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Under AT&T's proposed pricing, domestic calling card and operator-handled 
calls would go up 3.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Direct-dial calls from the United States to some foreign countries would 
increase 1.3%, and monthly subscription fees for some of the carrier's domestic 
rate-savings plans would increase 2.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular savings plans, True USA and True World, will not be affected 
because they don't charge subscription fees, McGann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the affected plans are Any Hour Saver, in which the $10 monthly 
subscription would rise to $10.75, and Reach Out 24 Hour, in which the fee 
would go from $8.70 to $9.50, McGann said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 16, AT&T increased monthly long-distance rates about 35 cents per 
customer, generating about $274 million in additional revenue annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The new pricing request also seeks to increase rates an average 5% for USA 
Direct Service calls. 
</P>
<P>
 That service allows a person in another country to place a call into the 
United States using a U.S. operator. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed increase would apply to 27 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T pledged not to increase basic long-distance rates for domestic calls in 
1995.  
</P>
<P>
 While the pledge is not legally binding, Nacchio said: "If we make a pledge we 
will keep it. . . . We're not going to violate our customers' trust."

KNOW YOUR OPTIONS IN FIGURING MUTUAL FUND GAINS AND LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALBERT B. CRENSHAW, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The markets have not been kind to mutual fund investors this year. Bond prices 
were devastated by rising interest rates, and stock prices didn't do a whole 
lot better. 
</P>
<P>
 While there has been no panic, numerous investors have been selling shares. In 
some cases, these sales locked in profits from earlier years, while others 
allowed investors to shift into bonds, Treasury securities and certificates of 
deposit, which have been paying rates well above inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever their reasons, mutual fund investors who sold shares this year 
face a chronic problem: figuring out their taxable gains or losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadly speaking, mutual fund shares are like stocks: Your gain or loss is 
what you sell it for minus what you paid for it. So in concept, determining 
gain or loss is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 But because investors tend to make repeated purchases of the same fund or have 
their dividends and capital gains reinvested in more shares, they typically end 
up with a mishmash of shares bought at different times and for different 
prices. That can turn figuring the gain or loss into a complicated computation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the difficulty, the Internal Revenue Service allows taxpayers to 
choose from four different methods of computing their gains. The agency, it 
should be noted, isn't trying to torture taxpayers; the different methods have 
different advantages and disadvantages, and the choice gives taxpayers 
flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news, though, is that more and more mutual fund operators are 
providing investors with helpful information. With their increasingly 
computerized back offices, the big fund operators can keep track of investors' 
transactions and provide them with data to compute their gains and losses. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, T. Rowe Price automatically sends any shareholder who has sold or 
exchanged shares during the year a statement that shows the investor's average 
share cost and the gain or loss based on that cost. 
</P>
<P>
 However, before using the data the mutual fund sends out, investors should 
understand their options, because they may want to compute their gains or 
losses differently. 
</P>
<P>
 While you can't change the price you got for selling, you can use different 
methods to figure out what you paid for the shares, a figure sometimes referred 
to as the "basis." 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS allows four methods for calculating the basis: 
</P>
<P>
 * First in, first out. Known as FIFO, this method assumes you sell shares in 
the order in which you purchased them. In other words, the ones you sell first 
are the oldest ones you own. This method is relatively easy to use, and in 
fact, if you do not specify otherwise, the IRS will assume you are using it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the market has been rising, the oldest shares will show the 
biggest gain and thus incur the most tax. Especially considering that capital 
gains taxes may be reduced next year, you may want to use a different method 
that produces less immediate gain. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, there can be reasons to use it. For example, if you had a 
big loss on some other asset you sold this year, you can use that loss to 
offset the gain on your older fund shares and save the newer, higher-cost ones 
-- which will show less gain -- to sell later. 
</P>
<P>
 * Specific identification. With this method, you specify the shares you are 
selling and use their basis in calculating gain or loss. 
</P>
<P>
 This is useful because by choosing certain shares, you can decide how much 
gain or loss to recognize. But there's a hitch: You have to make the 
identification at the time you sell. You have to give specific instructions to 
the fund operator or broker as to which shares to sell, and you have to get 
back written confirmation after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So if you sold shares earlier this year and didn't identify them at the time, 
you can't use this method. And if you are expecting to sell next week or next 
year and thus could still meet the requirements, check with your mutual fund. 
Not all of them are able to generate the kind of confirmation you need. 
</P>
<P>
 * Average basis, single category. With this method, which is probably the 
easiest, you simply add up the total cost of all your shares and divide by the 
number of shares. The result is your average basis. When you sell, it is 
assumed that the oldest shares are sold first. 
</P>
<P>
 This method offers less flexibility in managing gains and losses, but its 
simplicity -- and the fact that the data is supplied by many fund operators -- 
make it the method of choice for most taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, though: You must tell the IRS you are using the average basis 
method, or it will assume you are using FIFO. Also, once you start with this 
method -- or the double-category method described below -- you have to stay 
with it for all shares you sell from this same fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * Average basis, double category. In this method, you divide your shares into 
those you have held for a year or more and those you have bought more recently. 
The shareholder must specify which category shares are being sold from, and the 
fund must confirm this in writing. Otherwise the IRS will assume they are from 
the long-term category. 
</P>
<P>
 This is complicated, but it can be helpful for high-income investors trying to 
make maximum use of the tax break given for long-term gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund experts also caution investors to make sure they include all allowable 
costs in the basis. This means making sure you include the load, or sales 
charge, if you paid one and any reinvested dividends or capital gains you have 
received along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes investors simply treat their original investment as the basis, 
forgetting those reinvested distributions. Since those were taxable when 
received, failure to include them results in paying taxes on them a second 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, some investors who exchange shares in one fund for shares 
in another run by the same company don't realize that can be a taxable 
transaction, said Steven E. Norwitz of T. Rowe Price. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people have an exchange from one fund to another and don't even 
think of it as a sale, (because) they didn't get any cash. But for tax purposes 
it's no different than a redemption," he said.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; PROFIT TAKING CLIPS ASCENT OF BLUE CHIPS; DOW FALLS 22.2

<P>
 Blue-chip stocks snapped a four-day advance Wednesday, hurt by year-end profit 
taking, a drop in the dollar and some signs of stability in the Mexican market 
slowing the migration into American holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock price movements were exaggerated by thin holiday-week trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.20 to 3,839.49 after being run up 94 
points in the previous four sessions. The blue-chip index had gained more than 
175 points since it closed at 3,677.99 on Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in the dollar was felt most in the bond market, where prices fell 
sharply in a sell-off that spilled into stocks. Given that situation, there 
were "good reasons to take profits," said Bob Walberg, market analyst at MMS 
International in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones nearly 3 to 2 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, but volume was light. About 243 million shares changed hands on 
the Big Board, up from 211 million shares traded Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell nearly 3 pfennigs to about 1.55 German marks on technical 
factors, and declined against the Japanese yen and other major currencies. The 
drop in the dollar pushed the price of the 30-year bond down 27/32 point, or 
$8.44 per $1,000 in face value. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite 
direction, rose to 7.83% from 7.76% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter term Treasury securities posted smaller losses, and most bills, the 
shortest term maturities, actually gained strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Market strategists said the drop in long-term bond prices was sparked by fears 
that the dollar's decline would accelerate inflation. Rising prices tend to 
diminish the value of bonds and other securities that pay interest at fixed 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also fell against the Mexican peso after a strong run-up over the 
last week. Investors grew concerned that Mexico's financial crisis would begin 
to have an adverse effect on the dollar and U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
 There were unconfirmed reports that Mexico would try to increase a $6-billion 
credit line with the United States and use the borrowed money to buy pesos. 
Such a strategy would aim to bolster the beleaguered Mexican peso, which went 
into free fall last week after the Mexican government abandoned its policy of 
supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Clark, senior director in equity trading at Mabon Securities, said that 
with the partial recovery in the peso, investors weren't necessarily following 
last week's strategy of selling Mexican securities and buying U.S. issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theme for the last couple of weeks that has really propped up the U.S. 
market is the repatriation of capital from Latin America," he said. "Now that 
we're seeing a little stability in Mexico, the impact of that has lessened a 
little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the trading highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Mexican stock market recovered some ground, so that American shares of 
Mexican companies ended higher. Mexico's IPC index, the key measure of the 
Bolsa, ended the day 2.67% higher. Telefonos de Mexico's American depositary 
receipts rose 3 3/4 to 41 1/2 on leading volume of 11.45 million shares on the 
New York Stock Exchange. Grupo Televisa rose 2 5/8 to 32 1/2. The Mexico Fund 
rose 2 1/4 to 22 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the 30 Dow index components, International Paper fell 1 1/2 to 74 5/8, 
IBM fell 1 1/4 to 73 and Caterpillar slid 1 to 54 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold stocks bucked the market trend and rose, along with a $2.10-per-ounce 
rise in spot gold prices to $383.70. Santa Fe Pacific Gold rose 1/2 to 13 1/4; 
American Barrick added 7/8 to 22 5/8; Placer Dome advanced 1 1/8 to 22. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retail stocks extended Tuesday's slide following reports of lackluster 
Christmas sales. Toys R Us fell 3 to 30 1/8 after a delayed opening for an 
order imbalance, following reports that Wertheim Schroder & Co. had lowered 
earnings estimates. A call to Wertheim Schroder was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 * AnnTaylor declined 2 1/4 to 31 7/8. Montgomery Securities said AnnTaylor 
might not meet its fourth-quarter profit goals and a C.J. Lawrence analyst 
lowered earnings estimates for it and several other retailers. Elsewhere, 
foreign markets were mixed. London stocks finished a quiet post-Christmas 
session mostly higher. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 closed 12.4 
points higher at 3,095.8. In Frankfurt, German share prices pared most of their 
minor gains by the close of the bourse session as DAX futures prices slipped 
into losses, dealers said. The DAX index ended up 2.86 points at 2,109.01. 
Tokyo stocks ended lower, with the Nikkei average off 45.83 points at 
19,665.53. 
</P>
<P>
 February deliveries of light, sweet crude oil finished 15 cents a barrel 
higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange, at $17.79.

 Frequent-Flier Changes: Many program changes begin next year, beginning with 
British Airways Executive Club on Sunday and followed in February by American 
and United. The most talked-about change is the increase in mileage from 20,000 
to 25,000 for domestic coach ticket awards at several airlines, but most other 
awards are changing as well.Most of the changes require more mileage than 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest Airlines, which also changes its program Feb. 1, will still allow a 
20,000-mile domestic coach trip during two fall months. Alaska Airlines, which 
has a more limited choice of destinations, will increase its domestic award to 
20,000 from 15,000, also beginning Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, mileage on many programs earned in 1991 expires at the end of the 
year unless it is used for an award.

 U.S. May Impose Trade Sanctions on China This Week: The curbs could be imposed 
on up to $800 million worth of Chinese exports -- from toys to textiles -- if 
China fails to meet U.S. demands to end copyright piracy, according to sources 
close to the dispute. The list of items targeted for possible sanctions could 
be proposed later this week, the sources said, with the curbs to go into effect 
following a period of public comment.No date has been set, the sources said. 
Other imports on which the sanctions could be imposed include shoes and 
electrical goods, both of which are major components in China's list of exports 
to the United States. U.S. firms have put their losses due to Chinese piracy at 
$800 million, and the United States typically targets imports to redress that 
loss, the sources said. The U.S. trade deficit with China is second only to its 
deficit with Japan.

EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE? N.Y.? HILTON DREAMS UP SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I t's called the "first-night ef fect," and many business travelers know it 
well -- sleepless in a strange bed, in a strange hotel room far from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton Hotels Corp. says it's doing something to fight the problem, something 
that will go beyond obvious gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility, according to Michael Ribero, executive vice president for 
marketing and strategic planning at Hilton, would be East and West Coast wings 
or floors in hotels in major transcontinental destination cities such as Los 
Angeles, Boston and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the concept is still being thought out, it could involve controlled 
artificial lighting that would follow the time zone schedule of the coastal 
city from which the traveler came, allowing him or her to adjust more easily. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The same might be tried in other gateway cities frequented by travelers from 
more distant, foreign time zones, Ribero said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have yet to implement anything," he said. "We don't want to do gimmicky 
things. What you're doing is promising a better night's sleep, and there's no 
gimmick that can do that." 
</P>
<P>
 What Hilton is doing now, in cooperation with the National Sleep Foundation, 
is giving away a booklet that helps people deal with what Ribero calls 
"transient sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Among its suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Stay up until 10 p.m. local time before going to bed, even if it's several 
hours later where you came from. Too much sleep may be counterproductive. A 
short nap or two earlier in the evening is better. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the risk of looking like an insecure 4-year-old, bring along your own 
pillow or blanket. The small clock radio you usually wake up to at home might 
take the chill off the room, as will a familiar family picture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sunlight does help your internal clock adjust. On eastbound trips, get out 
in the sun early in the morning; when headed west, do the opposite and take in 
the sun late in the day when you arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many travelers are impressed with melatonin, a non-prescription synthetic 
version of the hormone released by a gland in the brain. Melatonin's release is 
stimulated by darkness and suppressed by light, and out-of-whack releases are 
thought to be the cause of jet lag. Some experts believe more studies are 
needed to determine the effectiveness of the drug and whether it should be sold 
by prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 * Skip that trip to the workout room if it's late in the day. Heavy exercise 
just before bedtime is a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet can be obtained by writing to "Sleep and the Traveler," c/o DCG, 
7758 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90046. It can also be ordered via fax at 
(213) 845-0189. 
</P>
<P>
 Ribero said Hilton was led to the sleep project because today's travelers 
usually have at least four competing hotels to choose from, and they 
increasingly choose on the basis of service and amenities, since prices are 
about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that one of the most important tiebreakers in choosing a hotel is 
how well the guest expects to sleep, Ribero said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very serious about our commitment to find out about the physiology of 
transient sleep," he said.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; AIRLINES AND TRAVELERS ANXIOUSLY 
AWAIT HIGH COURT'S DECISION ON MILEAGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH, CAROL SMITH is a free-lance writer based in Pasadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frequent-flier miles may be one of the most popular freebies around, but 
disgruntled fliers get annoyed when they can't use an award or the airlines up 
the ante. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, passenger dissatisfaction has primarily been a problem for airline 
customer service departments. But depending on the outcome of a U.S. Supreme 
Court case involving American Airlines, such complaints could become a problem 
for their legal departments as well. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision in Wolens vs. American Airlines, a case that has been wending 
through the courts since 1988, is expected early next year. A ruling against 
American has the potential to open up mileage award programs to state 
regulation, a move that carriers fear could make frequent-flier programs too 
complicated to administer and could make them vulnerable to a host of new 
consumer lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer groups such as the International Airline Passengers Assn. in Dallas 
and Inside Flyer in Colorado have noted increasing complaints by frequent 
fliers. One Manhattan Beach passenger was so frustrated with Northwest Airlines 
after trying for nearly a year to use his free miles on a ticket to Bangkok 
that he recently took the airline to small claims court. But the threat of 
lawsuits is not the airlines' only concern. 
</P>
<P>
 If the high court decision goes against the airline, it could threaten the 
existence of frequent-flier programs, American spokeswoman Teresa Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nearly impossible to even offer a frequent-flier program," she 
said. "From an administrative standpoint, if every state's laws would apply, 
you'd essentially have 50 different programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolens vs. American Airlines was originally filed in Illinois on behalf of 4 
million to 9 million members of American's AAdvantage frequent-flier program. 
The plaintiffs argued that the carrier violated state consumer laws when it 
changed the rules of its program retroactively, affecting how miles could be 
used after they were already earned in good faith. They see the frequent-flier 
programs as contracts the airlines cannot break. 
</P>
<P>
 American has the oldest and largest frequent-flier program in the country, 
with 23 million members. The airline honored 2.2 million awards for free travel 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is whether airlines can have contracts enforced" under state 
laws, said Gilbert Gordon, attorney for the plaintiffs. If the answer is yes, 
nothing will change except that airlines will be held accountable to the rules 
they specify when passengers join their frequent-flier programs, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the answer is no, it means airlines can change their frequent-flier 
programs at will, he said. Airlines have always had the right to change the 
rules on how miles earned in the future can be used, Gordon said. But if they 
cannot be held liable under state consumer fraud laws, they could continue to 
change rules retroactively, thus affecting the value of miles already earned. 
In most cases, the airlines have given fliers a short grace period in which to 
use up miles under old rules.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that airline frequent-flier programs 
should be subject to state laws. American appealed the ruling to the U.S. 
Supreme Court, arguing that airlines are not subject to state laws because of 
the Airline Deregulation Act passed in the late 1970s, which exempts carriers 
from state laws on matters relating to rates, routes and services. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court heard oral arguments in the case last month and is expected to 
rule as early as February or March, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is the most significant test of the issue of state regulation to 
date, Hanson said. However, it is not the first. In June, 1993, a ticket-holder 
who was denied a seat on an overbooked flight sued Northwest Airlines for 
"breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing" under Montana law. In that 
case, the appellate court found that the claim was preempted under the Airline 
Deregulation Act and that the plaintiff could not seek punitive damages. 
However, the court did allow the plaintiff to seek compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance, the Texas attorney general's office sued Trans World 
Airlines for allegedly deceptive advertising and trade practices, claiming the 
airline did not disclose all surcharges in its ads. In that case, the court 
found that airline advertising practices were exempt from state laws because of 
the federal law.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite a history of the courts agreeing that airlines are not subject to 
state laws, the industry is still nervous as it awaits the Supreme Court 
decision.

 "It's a major concern," said Chris Chiames, spokesman for the American 
Transport Assn., a Washington-based trade organization representing the 
industry. "It opens the door to all kinds of regulation by state governments 
that airlines are currently not subject to." 
</P>
<P>
 If the court were to agree with the Illinois decision, every state could 
regulate the programs differently, said Jon Austin, spokesman for Northwest 
Airlines. "It would have a pretty dramatic impact for the industry."

 Japan's Current Account Surplus Up 15% in November: The increase from the same 
month last year reversed a three-month decline, the Finance Ministry 
said.Still, the ministry said, the long-term trend points to a decreasing 
surplus in the current account, a measure of spending on nearly all goods and 
services. The November surplus was $9.67 billion. After adjusting for seasonal 
factors, that was 36% higher than October's figure, partly due to a jump in 
Japan's trade surplus, a key component of the current account.

'RUSH' STORE BLAMES LOSS OF LEASE ON HIS DETRACTORS

 A vendor catering to fans of Rush Limbaugh is getting the bum's rush from an 
upscale shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Current Events, which sells Limbaugh T-shirts, baseball caps, coffee mugs and 
"Rush Is Right" bumper stickers from a kiosk at Lane Avenue Shopping Center, 
will lose its lease when it expires Saturday, said owner Bill Khourie. 
</P>
<P>
 He blamed pressure from anti-Limbaugh forces who have picketed the mall 
recently. "It's tragic that this is happening, but I don't own the shopping 
center," Khourie said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall General Manager Marcy Starkey denied management was reacting to the 
handful of protesters. The decision not to renew the lease was part of a 
routine tenant evaluation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rosenberg, who led the protests, said: "We feel that the politics of 
divisiveness and hatred are bad business." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Limbaugh nor his chief of staff, Kit Carson, was available to comment.

MERGERS PROVED TO BE ONE OF 1994'S LEADING GROWTH INDUSTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mergers and acquisitions business was one of the few real moneymakers on 
Wall Street in 1994, with the overall deal volume setting a record thanks to a 
flurry of last-minute activity. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a tabulation by Securities Data Co. released Wednesday, announced 
M&A activity that involved U.S. companies as targets totaled $336 billion with 
just a few days to go before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The old record was $335.8 billion, set in 1988. Experts said they expect the 
booming M&A trend to continue into 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Wolitzer, a managing director at Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., said the 
roots of the 1994 boom go back 12 to 18 months when the economy was emerging 
from recession. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that against a background of modest economic improvement, business 
people seized on external deals as the quickest way to expand, rather than 
simply relying on internal growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "More recently we saw the European economy coming out of recession, and that 
dovetailed into it," Wolitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said banks were flush with cash, giving companies the option of doing 
acquisitions for cash or stock. Stock prices were at record highs early in the 
year before interest rates began moving up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The financing dynamics were pretty good on both a stock and cash basis, and 
then there were a number of industries where there were tremendous dynamic 
changes going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among the industry themes driving M&A was the convergence of 
entertainment and telecommunications into what is called the information 
superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when the politics of health care reform became bogged down, industry 
participants began going out and doing their own deals to reflect a more 
competitive marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Pharmaceutical manufacturers teamed up with pharmacy benefits managers, and 
other health care providers sought economy of scale in a wave of mergers. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial services was another hot area for mergers, with mutual fund 
companies among those being merged into larger organizations. Dreyfus Corp. 
became part of Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank Corp. last summer in a $1.8-billion 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 A shrinking defense industry was a driving force in several deals, including 
the acquisition of Grumman Corp. by Northrop Corp. The combined entity is now 
known as Northrop Grumman Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in 1995 M&A will continue to do well as long as interest rates do not 
rise too dramatically," said Perrin Long, an independent analyst who tracks the 
securities industry. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in a year in which industry profits were down sharply on poor 
underwriting due to slumping stock and bond markets, M&A and margin interest 
activity stood out as two moneymakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was notable in M&A for the flop of the planned merger of Bell 
Atlantic Corp. and Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulation of the cable industry was widely blamed for killing that 
deal, which would have been one of the biggest ever. However, some traders said 
the structure of the deal was too generous to TCI and that approval by Bell 
Atlantic shareholders would have been hard to get.

MOSCOW AIRCRAFT GROUP SPREADING ITS WINGS; RUSSIA: THE MAKER OF MIG FIGHTERS IS 
DIVERSIFYING ITS OUTPUT TO INCLUDE SPORTING PLANES AND CONSUMER GOODS SUCH AS 
WASHING MACHINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moscow Aircraft Production Organization, maker of generations of the 
Warsaw Pact's feared MiG fighters, is battling for new markets with products as 
diverse as miniature sporting planes and folding beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Its once-top-secret plant, built on a sprawling site in the heart of the city, 
is still building 18 MiG-29s front-line planes for Malaysia under a 
$600-million deal, but now it makes other products too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just over half our output is military now," technical director Ivan Butko 
told reporters on a rare visit to the factory. "Three years ago, it was 80%." 
</P>
<P>
 In a chilly, cavernous workshop in the middle of the plant, partially built 
MiG jets with their characteristic twin tail planes stood in long rows. 
</P>
<P>
 Craftsmen on gantries leaned over the planes, welding and adjusting 
components. 
</P>
<P>
 But between the MiG skeletons stood several dozen less lethal aircraft, for 
which the plant has high hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Powered by an Austrian Rotax engine running on ordinary petrol, the ultralight 
biplane Aviatika MAI-890U can fly up to 185 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The MiG-29's top speed is 1,500 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 On MAPO's airfield, which used to be Moscow's airport, test pilots put the 
Aviatika through its paces for watching defense attaches and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Slovak Defense Attache Ondrej Kubizniak donned a flying helmet and climbed 
beside the pilot in the tiny cockpit of the two-seater version for a spin 
around the airfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plane is small and light and intended mainly for sport. But for the 
aviator, the impression is wonderful," Kubizniak told the news conference 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Another pilot took off in the even more agile single-seater and, in a move 
that drew applause, switched the engine off, turned full circle and glided down 
to a perfect landing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aviatika was introduced about 18 months ago and MAPO officials say there 
has been keen interest abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 MAPO's company museum charts its almost-90-year history of producing civil and 
military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, it was so secret that, like other military plants, it was 
popularly known as a "post box." It had only a post office box number, no 
address; it appeared on no maps. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three decades, MAPO, which still employs nearly 20,000, has 
supplied some 3,000 MiGs to 40 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the end of the Cold War forced it to make radical changes. It has had 
no new MiG-29 orders from Moscow since 1991, although it is still busy 
servicing the fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the fact we have had no state orders since 1991, the economic 
situation of the plant is stable," Butko said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three years, it has exported the planes to Hungary, Slovakia and 
Romania, and the Malaysia deal was reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense and air attaches were invited to discuss ways to improve 
servicing, Butko said. 
</P>
<P>
 State-owned MAPO is the only Russian company to receive a license to sell its 
military output abroad. Previously, only the state arms company Rosvooruzheniye 
could trade abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 MAPO's main diversification plans involve making meat-processing and bakery 
equipment. Its other products include washing machines and greenhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 But military production continues. Among the plant's current projects is 
developing a MiG AT trainer, designed to prepare pilots to fly the MiG-29. It 
is being built with two French companies.

COUNTY FEARS REVENUE DEFICIT COULD TRIPLE TO $120 MILLION; BUDGET: OFFICIALS 
SIGNAL THAT EVEN MORE CUTBACKS THAN ENVISIONED LAST WEEK WILL BE NEEDED, THEY 
HOPE TO OFFSET LOSSES WITH CASH ADVANCES FROM OTHER GOVERNMENT SOURCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a week after announcing $40 million in budget cutbacks and savings, 
officials said Wednesday that Orange County's revenue shortfall for the next 
six months could be triple that amount and signaled that more severe measures 
will be needed to close the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit could reach $120 million by June, financial managers now say, 
because they no longer can count on earning interest on the county government's 
$2.7-billion share of the now-bankrupt Orange County investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to deal with an interest earnings loss of about $120 million," said 
Ernie Schneider, the county's administrative officer, who was counting on the 
interest income to balance the $470-million general fund budget through June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the additional revenue losses may be offset somewhat by further 
cash advances from federal, state and local sources. It also is possible that 
the pool may yet generate some interest. But the county is no longer counting 
on any money from a stream that had been budgeted to be its single biggest 
revenue source this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing deficit could mean even greater cutbacks than those already 
announced, and it could add urgency to talk of dipping into emergency funds and 
selling off county assets, such as John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news Wednesday, three weeks into Orange County's bankruptcy: 
</P>
<P>
 * The county' top lawyer revealed for the first time that he accompanied 
former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron to a meeting in April with 
officials of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, but did not tell 
the Board of Supervisors about the agency's concerns over the county's 
high-risk investment strategy. County Counsel Terry A. Andrus said he did not 
believe it was necessary to alert supervisors at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 * A somber protest by about three dozen members of the Orange County Employees 
Assn. failed to persuade county officials to reinstate labor contracts that 
were voided after the county filed for bankruptcy Dec. 6. Labor leaders contend 
that layoffs can be accomplished quickly within contract guidelines, but county 
management says that process could cost the county millions of dollars in 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next step is our lawsuit," said John H. Sawyer, the association's general 
manager, who led the team that met with county leaders for about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * The beleaguered city of Montebello received a $14-million infusion from the 
investment pool, a key part of the Los Angeles County community's plan to avoid 
defaulting on a $25.6-million note payment due Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * A dozen municipal bond firms expressed interest in helping the county sell 
bonds to bolster its finances -- a bailout strategy employed in the mid-1970s, 
when New York City teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. Among those interested: 
Goldman, Sachs & Co., Lehman Brothers, J.P. Morgan Securities and Bear Stearns 
& Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's revelation about the magnitude of the county's shortfall stunned 
labor leaders, who have equated $40 million worth of cuts and savings to a loss 
of 800 to 1,000 jobs. Tripling the budget gap over just the next six months 
could mean much greater staff reductions, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer said the trio of county managers who announced the cutbacks last week 
made it clear in a Wednesday meeting that the budget situation was more serious 
than county officials had earlier believed. But they made no mention that the 
budget cuts might be significantly higher than the $40 million already 
announced, said Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the depth of the crisis, he added, management should comply with 
bargaining agreements in laying off employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got the same position we had before," he said. "Whatever they can prove 
to us is necessary, we can work it out within the provisions of our contract. 
It makes it more severe, but the procedures are the same." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials' estimate of a huge loss in income over the next six months 
is based on their anticipated inability to receive $120 million in budgeted 
interest income from the now-collapsed investment fund, which has dropped $2.02 
billion in value this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one has come up with any firm ideas of how to cover a $120-million 
revenue shortfall in the next six months, county officials say they have 
reserves that will have to be emptied, such as $70 million set aside for 
"economic uncertainties." Meanwhile, officials said, the county has 1,525 
budgeted but unfilled jobs, and 2,256 current employees are eligible for early 
retirements that could ease the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The staggering new figure "adds an urgency to strategies that will produce 
additional revenue for the county," said Supervisor William G. Steiner. "The 
$40 million in cuts are only part of the solution." 
</P>
<P>
 The county treasury had invested $7.8 billion on behalf of 187 cities, school 
districts and other agencies in a high-risk investment strategy that backfired 
this year as interest rates rose and the value of the pool plunged 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 At a closed-door meeting Wednesday at Irvine City Hall, city and school 
officials from around Orange County expressed dismay at the county's assertion 
it had not yet assembled a clear picture of its fiscal condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to assume the county doesn't know," said Seal Beach City Manager Jerry 
L. Bankston. "They honestly do not know." 
</P>
<P>
 Another city manager who did not want to be identified said the county's 
financial management practices appeared to be "from the Stone Age." 
</P>
<P>
 Cities and school districts with money tied up in the ill-fated investment 
pool plan to hire an accounting firm to help make sense of county records, said 
Craig A. Barbarosh, an attorney who represents some cities that invested in the 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we simply don't have equal access with the county to 
information," Barbarosh said. "We need to know what the county, as the debtor 
in this case, needs short-term as well as long-term. We need information from 
the county to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Mayor Victor Leipzig said there are "drumbeats of discontent" 
among municipalities that invested in the fund. But Leipzig added that public 
officials seem, for the most part, willing to work within the system set up 
last week by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John E. Ryan for distributing money from the 
fund on an emergency basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cities are committed to working with the county," Leipzig said. "But 
they're getting frustrated, because the county does not appear to be working 
with them. The county could solve a lot of their problems by being a little bit 
more up front." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport-Mesa Unified School District board member Judy Franco said their have 
been no indications that the county has a long-range plan in place for dealing 
with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, where do we go from here?" Franco said. "There isn't a lot 
of information out there yet." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they are hopeful that ongoing negotiations with the county 
will lead to the distribution of some property tax revenues that have been help 
up since the bankruptcy filing. The county administers the money for the 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're negotiating with the county to get those funds made available to the 
cities and districts," said Barbarosh. "We're hopeful that those pre-bankruptcy 
petition dollars will be made available soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, the county's management council -- made up of Sheriff Brad 
Gates, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and Health Care Agency Director Tom Uram 
-- spoke with union members about the county's dire economic picture. The three 
stood by their recommendation that the board of supervisors suspend union 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The county employees association had requested that the management council 
urge supervisors to rescind last Thursday's resolutions. Those actions 
superseded layoff provisions in employee contracts, which require that any 
terminations be based on seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopeful, but they certainly didn't agree with our request," Sawyer 
said. "They said they had made their decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Some employees said they felt betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "God knows how many countless hours I've sat in negotiations with the county," 
said Jim Best, a civilian employee with the Sheriff's Department who has been 
on union bargaining teams since 1982. "It makes me wonder, what have I done 
with all this time if they unilaterally rescind our contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Best said he addressed the management council on the topics of "honesty, honor 
and dishonor." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every worker is angry. What are we going to do to remedy this situation?" he 
said. "I don't feel very comfortable knowing that my department head can 
arbitrarily lay me off two weeks from now." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce Moore, a deputy probation counselor, said he talked with Capizzi 
after the closed session and found him receptive to worker concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "He appeared to be agonizing over the process," said Moore, a 23-year county 
employee. "I think we might have moved him a fraction of an inch, to at least 
go back to the board and express our feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the union, which represents 11,000 of the county's 18,000 workers, 
also expressed concerns about accrued benefits such as vacation, sick time, and 
retirement money placed in deferred compensation accounts, employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting came as other unions researched the legality of last week's 
actions by the board of supervisors, which has asked county department heads to 
report back Jan. 10 with specific plans for budget cuts and layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Attorneys Assn. -- made up of about 300 lawyers from the 
offices of the district attorney, public defender and county counsel -- met 
with the management council Tuesday to discuss similar issues, according to 
Paul Crost, who represents the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Crost said he made it clear that the association believed its contracts should 
be reinstated and that accrued vacation hours should not be tied up in the 
bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be considering the legal ramifications of actions they have 
taken," Crost said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more class action lawsuits were filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana 
on Tuesday and Wednesday, bringing the total class action suits stemming from 
Orange County's bankruptcy to at least 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lawsuits by investors ask for damages for those who bought Orange 
County bonds. The value of county-issued bonds has been damaged, the suits 
contend, because of "reckless" or "fraudulent" investment practices by county 
officials and Merrill Lynch, the largest underwriter of the county's bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Both suits name Merrill Lynch, former treasurer Citron, and Merrill Lynch 
executive Michael Stamenson as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the suits, on behalf of Jack W. Martin and Gertrude Martin, states that 
the Martins bought $5,000 worth of county bonds in 1990. The other suit, by Al 
Markowitz, says he bought $120,898 worth of county bonds earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Both suits contend that the defendants misled investors into thinking their 
money was safe by failing to disclose critical information about the county's 
precarious financial health.

O.C. DOCTOR CONVICTED OF MURDERS IN '93 CRASH; TRIAL: COLLISION KILLED MISSION 
VIEJO COUPLE. LAGUNA BEACH PHYSICIAN WAS UNDER INFLUENCE OF DRUGS, ALCOHOL. 
</P>

<P>
 A Laguna Beach physician with a history of drunk driving arrests was convicted 
on two murder counts Wednesday for driving while intoxicated and causing a car 
wreck that killed a Mission Viejo couple and injured three others. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ronald Allen, 32, who was well known for treating poor AIDS patients, 
becomes one of the few drivers in Orange County to be charged and convicted of 
second-degree murder for taking lives while driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
 He was found guilty by a Superior Court jury in Santa Ana that deliberated for 
2 1/2 days after trial testimony ended. He faces a maximum term of 30 years to 
life in prison when he is sentenced Feb. 24 in the deaths of Mark and Noreen 
Minzey. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict brought exclamations of "Oh, God" and sobs from friends of the 
Minzeys, including Jackie Rodriguez, who was riding with the couple. Rodriguez 
was injured in the crash, along with her sister, Danielle, and the Minzeys' 
daughter, Karie. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen sat with his head bowed and eyes closed for most of the proceeding, 
showing no visible emotion as the verdicts were read. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was given a gift to save lives, and look what's done with it," Jackie 
Rodriguez said afterward. "He took two lives. He should just be put away and 
not be allowed to go back to the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Rebecca Rodriguez, the mother of Jackie and Danielle, 
said: "I was praying to God that the public was tired of drunk drivers, and 
today the jury's verdict shows me they are." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has to answer to God now," she said. "We can forgive him, but he has to 
live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Noreen Minzey, 33, and Mark Minzey, 38, were on their way home after attending 
Karie's softball game on July 11, 1993, when their car was struck head-on by 
Allen's rented vehicle on Santiago Canyon Road near Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash left Karie Minzey, now 12, critically injured with broken bones and 
head injuries. Jackie Rodriguez, now 25, suffered burns on her legs and 
Danielle Rodriguez, now 12, sustained a broken arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen was found to have been driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most intoxicated drivers in fatal collisions are charged with vehicular 
manslaughter, which carries a maximum prison term of 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors took the unusual step of lodging the most serious charges 
possible against Allen, arguing that his medical background and two prior 
arrests on suspicion of driving while intoxicated made him fully aware of the 
deadly risks when he got behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Deputy Public Defender Michael P. Giannini had asked jurors to 
convict Allen on lesser charges of manslaughter, arguing that his client was 
suffering from clinical depression and struggling financially. Just hours 
before the crash, Allen had learned that his father had died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdict, Giannini said that being labeled a murderer was painful for 
the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here is still a man who trained his whole life to save lives and now members 
of the community are labeling him a murderer," he said. "That's a very 
difficult philosophical pill for him to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
 Giannini said he is disappointed in the verdict and plans to appeal. He will 
also argue at sentencing for much less than the maximum term. 
</P>
<P>
 But jurors said that despite the tragic aspects of the case for Allen, he 
deserved a tough sentence because he must have known what could happen when he 
decided to drink, take drugs and drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's prior drunk driving arrests and medical training also convinced jurors 
that he had sufficient understanding that he could harm others when he took the 
wheel, according to jury foreman John Gornik of Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't figure he was a bad person because of prior incidents, but we knew 
he knew the consequences," Gornik said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gornik added that jurors tried hard not to become emotionally involved in the 
case or step into the role of crusaders against drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we wanted to say was these are the laws and they were broken. We feel we 
did the right thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Ron Taylor, 34, said tempers flared during deliberations because some 
jurors weren't at first convinced that Allen knew what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very difficult because a few of us were leaning the other way at first 
and felt he was out of his mind," he said. "But we came to the conclusion that 
he knew what he was doing. He was very smart." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said the fact that Allen didn't testify worked against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt he might have seemed more sympathetic if he had testified," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said Karie Minzey's testimony, during which she said she felt no anger 
toward Allen, touched jurors and made them sympathize with the Minzey family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all amazed at her attitude," he said. "We all wished we were a lot 
like her and could forgive that way. Her testimony had a big emotional impact 
on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Her testimony was also an emotional turning point for Allen, helping him 
accept responsibility for what he has done, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That did more than for him than any verdict the jury could have," Giannini 
said. "He is totally remorseful. But to know that she is not going to spend her 
life in anger and being embittered also gives him tremendous hope. The girl's 
forgiveness took away some of the horrible sting he feels." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the second-degree murder counts, the jury found Allen guilty of felony 
drunk driving for the injuries to Karie Minzey and the Rodriguezes. 
</P>
<P>
 Karie and her older sister, Shelbie, who was not involved in the crash, now 
live with an aunt and uncle in Georgia. The family greeted the verdict with 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just really glad it's over," said Jeanine Posey, the girls' aunt and 
Mark Minzey's sister. "We're glad that he got all three counts. Hopefully it 
will save someone else's life." 
</P>
<P>
 Karie, who had helped lead her all-star softball team to victory shortly 
before the crash, suffered a broken left knee and right wrist, but the most 
serious injuries were to her head. While she was in a coma, doctors shaved her 
head and removed nearly the entire left side of her skull to relieve pressure 
on her swollen brain. 
</P>
<P>
 She had to learn to walk again and must undergo further operations. The 
removed portion of her skull was frozen and later replaced, but it has not 
healed properly and has left a large sunken spot on the left rear of her head. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Molko has termed the incident "the most egregious 
drunk driving case" he's seen in 20 years "both because of the injuries and how 
much knowledge he (Allen) had of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 "He learned so much in medical school and yet with all that awareness, he 
ended up committing one of the worst deeds you can," he continued. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of the crash, Molko said Allen had been driving recklessly, using 
left-turn pockets to speed ahead of traffic on the rural road. Blood tests show 
Allen had used alcohol and taken five different drugs, including a 
"substantial" amount of Valium, before the fatal crash. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Molko also emphasized Allen's previous brushes with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993 -- shortly before the fatal crash -- Allen was arrested on 
suspicion of public intoxication, hit-and-run driving and resisting arrest 
after he allegedly rammed his car into three parked vehicles in Laguna Beach. 
That case was pending at the time of the July 11 accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before the crash that killed the Minzeys, Allen was cited for speeding. 
But the officer who stopped him did not discover an outstanding warrant for his 
arrest stemming from another collision in April, 1992, when Allen allegedly 
rear-ended a car while driving drunk in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1992, Allen had consumed alcohol shortly before he was stopped by a 
police officer in Palm Springs, according to court testimony. The officer 
admonished Allen after learning of his profession, saying, "You should know 
better than that," according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 But Giannini stressed through the trial that Allen had never been convicted of 
driving while intoxicated, although charges were pending at the time of the 
fatal crash, and asked jurors not to discriminate against Allen because of his 
medical background. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen also faces civil lawsuits seeking damages filed by the Minzey and 
Rodriguez families.

FOG HAS OFTEN DRAPED STATE'S HIGHWAYS IN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As Wednesday's pileup on the Golden State Freeway graphically showed, 
visibility can drop without warning on California highways, with deadly 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 29, 1991, motorists on the same freeway encountered a sudden dust 
storm north of Coalinga. Seventeen people died and 151 were injured in the 
ensuing 104-vehicle pileup. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these types of accidents occur in mountain passes or broad valleys, 
particularly the San Joaquin. The following are some of the worst accidents in 
recent California history: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 15, 1994: In a series of eight rapid-fire accidents, more than 70 
vehicles piled into each other on California 99 between Livingston and Selma, 
killing two and injuring more than 60. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 23, 1993: A 25-vehicle pileup on Interstate 80 just west of Sacramento 
sent eight victims to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 18, 1992: A motorist slamming into a police cruiser that had stopped at 
an accident site touched off a 30-vehicle collision on Interstate 15 near 
Rancho Cucamonga, injuring 24 people. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 20, 1992: Three chain-reaction crashes involving nearly 100 vehicles, 
including a packed school bus, killed one and injured 46 on Interstate 15 in 
the San Bernardino Mountains' Cajon Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 7, 1991: A dozen crashes involving nearly 100 vehicles on a 15-mile 
stretch of California 99 south of Fresno killed four people. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officials say motorists who find themselves suddenly shrouded in fog or 
dust rarely follow a simple, common-sense rule. "No. 1, slow down," said Wendy 
Moore, a spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol's Newhall office. "It's 
very basic." 
</P>
<P>
 In some situations, Moore said, motorists can try to exit to a location where 
it is safe to stop -- rest areas, roadside cafes and the like. But then they 
should wait out the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, if they get off, they're going to encounter the same 
problem," Moore said. "Don't just get off to drive somewhere else, on smaller 
roads." 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers should use hazard lights only if they are forced to stop in the 
roadway, she said. "Hazards can cause more problems than it's worth," said 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 Using hazard lights while traveling or parked on the shoulder can be 
particularly confusing to oncoming drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "With that kind of fog and visibility, they can't tell where the road ends and 
will drive right into you," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 When forced to stop for an accident, she said, motorists should turn on hazard 
lights and stay inside the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're safer inside. You've got metal around you and people can see your 
vehicle before they can see you." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the worst pileups in the San Joaquin Valley have been attributed to 
so-called tule fog -- named for a Native American tribe of the region. It is 
caused by a variety of factors, including inversion layers, wind-swept dust and 
the depth of the valley floors.

 It doesn't seem possible. Could all this have happened in one year? A 
President came home to be buried.So did a missing woman, whose grisly fate was 
finally uncovered. A mighty military base commenced its disappearance. So did a 
not-so-mighty football team. A wanted man's now infamous white Ford Bronco was 
spotted on a freeway in Irvine headed toward the most publicized trial in 
history. If fire-ravaged Laguna Beach neighborhoods, houses began to rise. But 
the county treasurer's house of cards collapsed, taking who knows how many 
people with it. Who will ever forget 1994?

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; CITIES PLAN SUITS OVER FROZEN TAX REVENUE; 
RECOURSE: SEVERAL HAVE THREATENED LEGAL ACTION OVER MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN 
PROPERTY TAX FUNDS BEING WITHHELD BY THE COUNTY. HUNTINGTON BEACH HAS SET A 
JAN. 6 DEADLINE.

<P>
 In a move likely to compound the county's financial woes, several cities 
threatened Wednesday to file lawsuits to gain access to millions of dollars in 
property tax revenue tied up in the county treasury because of the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach City Council voted to file a lawsuit against the county 
unless it works out an agreement by Jan. 6 for the release of about $2.5 
million in revenue. Costa Mesa officials also threatened legal action if the 
disputed funds are not disbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is acceptable to us is that 100% of the property taxes due us come to 
us," said Richard Barnard, Huntington Beach's deputy city administrator. 
"Anything less would be unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 The county announced last week that it was withholding more than $20 million 
in property tax revenue due cities and school districts because the funds were 
collected before the Dec. 6 county bankruptcy filing and are now frozen in the 
county treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's action prompted Costa Mesa City Manager Allan L. Roeder to 
contact other cities this week in an effort to craft a plan to recoup the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing we agree on is that we don't want to go in 30 different 
directions," he said. "We wanted to find out if other cities were interested in 
one filing instead of going in different directions." 
</P>
<P>
 Roeder said several cities expressed interest in a joint lawsuit, but he 
declined to say which cities or exactly how many. He said officials have asked 
the bankruptcy creditors committee to find ways for the cities to receive the 
frozen tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach is trying to reclaim about $2.5 million in property taxes 
that the county held back last week, said city officials Wednesday. The city 
received $6 million in property tax revenue, money collected from Dec. 7 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
 While other cities and school districts have expressed outrage at the county's 
stance, Huntington Beach is the first to issue an ultimatum. The city set a 
deadline after pleas to the county for the frozen funds went unheeded, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are several legal alternatives we can pursue," said Huntington Beach 
Mayor Victor Leipzig after a special closed-session meeting. "The council is 
anxious for the city attorney to vigorously pursue our tax money." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials argued that the county has no legal ownership of the property 
taxes earmarked for cities and that its only role is to collect and distribute 
the tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is holding that money in trust," Barnard said. "We are not 
creditors. We are beneficiaries. . . . We have not lost any of that money." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Costa Mesa Mayor Joe Erickson: "It's our opinion (that property tax 
funds) weren't part of the bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chuck Hulse, the county's chief deputy auditor-controller, said that the 
county was forced to freeze the property taxes because they were in the county 
treasury at the time the bankruptcy was declared. He said the cities would have 
to go through the bankruptcy court for disbursement of the tax money. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last week, Huntington Beach officials have taken their case to top 
county officials. On Tuesday, Leipzig sent a letter to outgoing Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley saying he was "disappointed" that the city would not collect 
all its property tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The freezing of city assets in the county investment pool was difficult 
enough," Leipzig wrote. "However, the withholding of duly collected tax 
revenues is simply not acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Leipzig added in the letter: "These (tax) revenues, of course, are our legal 
right. And as a practical matter, they are the essential lifeblood of city 
services. They are vital to our continued operations. The city must demand 
payment in full." 
</P>
<P>
 However, other cities expressed reservations about suing the county for the 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be more confusing than helpful," said Los Alamitos Assistant City 
Manager Gerard Goedhart. "Right now, the best way is to collect more 
information. Nobody wants to be held in limbo." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials said they are still weighing whether to join possible legal 
action against the county. Anaheim has $169 million invested in the county 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute comes as cities and school districts received new property tax 
payments a week earlier than normal. County officials said they released the 
money early to help agencies with cash-flow problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim received $3.2 million Wednesday in property taxes, which were 
available since they had been collected after the county's bankruptcy filing. 
The county also gave the city $6.9 million in property tax monies last week. 
But Anaheim still has another $4.5 million in tax revenue tied up in the county 
treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know the fate of those funds," said Bret Colson, an Anaheim city 
spokesman.

 Orange County Auditor-Controller Steve E. Lewis proposed in a 1987 county 
audit that a broad-based panel -- including the county's top administrator and 
a member of the Board of Supervisors -- should monitor Citron's operations on a 
regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 But a member of the auditor's office who was close to the situation said 
Citron opposed having a committee and repeatedly frustrated efforts by Lewis 
and others to convene the group on an informal basis with him to try the idea 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Citron said no," said the official, who requested anonymity. "They went ahead 
informally to show Citron that they would not usurp him. But you could tell it 
would not work. There was no interaction, and it just died a quiet death." 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of the committee is similar to what happened to a string of Orange 
County Grand Jury reports and other county audits that formed a crescendo of 
warnings about Citron's operation during the past 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the oversight committee could have avoided the disastrous investment 
strategy that led to the nation's largest municipal bankruptcy, no one will 
ever know. But county sources said it might have added a valuable check in an 
office that has traditionally operated with little oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was the potential for more scrutiny," said the auditor's official. "It 
is hard to say what might have happened. It could have been an active committee 
and gotten involved in the operation. Things might have been different." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Citron nor his attorney could be reached for comment. He has 
maintained in the past that oversight was unnecessary and would hamper the 
treasurer's ability to make investment decisions in a fast-paced market. 
</P>
<P>
 County auditors recommended the oversight committee in an Oct. 20, 1987, 
report, which disclosed their findings from an examination of the treasurer's 
procedures and accounting practices for the entire year of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit detailed a list of management problems, including a lack of written 
procedures, incomplete record-keeping, and the continual failure of Citron to 
report the office's investment policies to the auditor-controller as required 
by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1987 audit by Lewis' office took note of a 1985 Orange County Grand Jury 
report that stated that there was little or no review of Citron's investment 
activity by the County Board of Supervisors, the county administrative officer 
or the auditor-controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the audit stated that the treasurer had obtained good yields on his 
investments, auditors stated it would be prudent for the county administrative 
officer and the Board of Supervisors to become more involved in the county's 
investment program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investment function has a tremendous impact on the funding of the 
county's entire operation and added participation of the board, and the CAO 
should help ensure that the investment strategies and policies best serve the 
county," the audit stated. 
</P>
<P>
 When the investment portfolio collapsed, the county of Orange had close to $3 
billion in the $7.8-billion treasurer's pool -- the largest single contributor 
of the 187 governmental entities with money in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' auditors envisioned a panel that would assure a long-term consistent 
investment strategy by setting policy and analyzing investment returns. It was 
to consist of the treasurer, assistant treasurer, auditor-controller, the 
county administrative officer, a member of the Board of Supervisors as well as 
a county department head or a knowledgeable member of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 In his official response dated Nov. 20, 1987, Citron argued against the 
audit's recommendation. He said the majority of investment funds came from 
districts and agencies unassociated with county government, hence county 
officials could not properly represent those interests on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron maintained that the panel would be burdensome because investment 
decisions must be made on a daily basis in response to ever-changing markets 
and opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Establishing a committee to perform the investment function not only removes 
the investing of public funds from those most capable to perform this important 
task, it would also make the county unable to react quickly to investment 
opportunities, which could materially affect interest earnings," Citron said. 
</P>
<P>
 He concluded by saying that no other county in California, including Los 
Angeles County, which had a $4-billion treasury at the time, uses an oversight 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Citron's reluctance, county officials said, the auditor-controller 
tried to convene the panel along with a representative of the county 
administrative office, but the treasurer was not enthusiastic about these 
informal attempts to get something started. Little could be done after that, 
the source said, and the Board of Supervisors paid no attention to the audit 
and its recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said the board is now looking at ways to make 
county department heads more accountable in the wake of the financial debacle. 
Specifically, he said, supervisors will review whether department heads should 
have the power, as they now do, to outright reject recommendations in county 
audits. 
</P>
<P>
 In another audit of the treasurer's practices, this one for the year 1991, the 
auditor-controller's office found similar problems with an existing internal 
review panel. It reported Citron might have broken the law with some of his 
investments and was dodging an internal investment committee consisting of 
himself, then-assistant treasurer Ray Wells and Matthew Raabe, then-chief of 
treasury operations.

 Unlikely couple: Huntington Beach political activist Bill Mello has emerged as 
a vocal critic of county officials in the wake of the financial crisis. But 
that doesn't mean he's lost his sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello, a leader of a taxpayers' group called the Committees of Correspondence, 
is out of town this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The greeting on his answering machine says he's not traveling alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi. Bob Citron and I will be playing blackjack in Vegas until the 30th," 
Mello jokes in the message, which goes on to wish callers happy holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron resigned as county treasurer-tax collector earlier this month.

 No comment: As city officials scurry to complete a questionnaire sent to them 
by Securities and Exchange Commission investigators on the troubled investment 
pool, Villa Park City Manager Fred Maley is putting his foot down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fishing expedition," he said Wednesday, adding that he doesn't plan to 
complete the 10-page questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Maley said he's focusing his energies on the city's financial situation and 
doesn't believe anything would be accomplished by answering a series of 
questions about the city's dealings with the county treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I considered it to be inflammatory," he said. "To me, it doesn't aid the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Maley said the city attorney informed him that Villa Park is under no legal 
obligation to complete the questionnaire.

 Can they afford a dictionary?: Irvine city officials have spent the last month 
trying to convince worried residents that the city is not teetering on the 
brink of financial collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Calming fears has proved difficult because of the city's hefty $209-million 
investment in the county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials insist that the city doesn't have any short-term cash flow problems 
because it placed funds in several investments, not just the county's pool. "We 
didn't put all of our eggs in that one basket," City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a council meeting Tuesday, Brady tried his best to eliminate one worst-case 
scenario for residents. " 'Bankruptcy' is not even in our vocabulary," he 
declared.

 No sunny day at the park: Because of the financial crisis, county parks were 
closed Monday. But that didn't stop hundreds of people from attempting to enjoy 
a day-after-Christmas picnic at Irvine Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies discovered the picnickers after noticing more than 100 cars 
parked illegally along Santiago Canyon Road near the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gates were padlocked with signs posted all over the place," Sheriff's Lt. 
Tom Garner said. "So to get around that, people parked illegally and walked 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 They were all told that their vehicles would be towed if they didn't move 
them, Garner said. By about 2 p.m., everyone had packed up and left the area, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 County parks will also be closed Monday.

 Helping hand: With $12.8 million of its money tied up in the troubled 
investment pool, the Tustin Unified School District is turning to an 
old-fashioned fund-raising technique: a garage sale. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 11-12, school district officials said they plan to sell old furniture, 
chairs, desks, fans, file cabinets, tables, televisions, typewriters, vacuum 
cleaners and other surplus district property. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the garage sale is held every year, officials said the event has 
taken on more urgency this time because of the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the school board approved more than $1 million in cuts, 
including a halt to the purchase of new equipment and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that can bring money into the district is a special event this 
year," said Trustee Jonathan W. Abelove. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale will take place at the district's Support Services Facility, 1302 
Service Road, Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Money from the garage sale would be used to buy needed classroom supplies.

O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; PLAINTIFFS AWAIT PAYOUT OF JUDGMENTS; COLLECTIONS: COURT 
AWARDS SEIZED FROM DEFENDANTS ARE BEING WITHHELD BY THE COUNTY 
AUDITOR-CONTROLLER'S OFFICE.

<P>
 For less than $1,200, it has hardly been worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ed Schaum believes that there is a principle involved here. The way he 
sees it, he won a judgment, fair and square, in an Orange County small-claims 
court. County officials helped him collect his money from the company he had 
sued. 
</P>
<P>
 The next thing he knew, the county was holding onto the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just stunned when I learned they had appropriated money that was never 
theirs to begin with," said Schaum, 52, a mortgage broker in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach resident is among an unknown number of plaintiffs awaiting 
perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars in court judgments that were frozen as 
a result of the county's bankruptcy, a county official said. The money, seized 
from defendants by the county marshal's office, is not being paid out by the 
county auditor-controller's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Such awards range from "small-claims fender-bender judgments" to Superior 
Court judgments against large corporations, said Don Spears of the marshal's 
office. Spears, whose office enforces court orders authorizing seizure of the 
money from bank accounts and elsewhere, said that the vast majority of 
judgments his agency enforces are well under $100,000. The orders for seizure 
can come from courts throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Spears did not know how much money was being withheld or how many other 
plaintiffs are affected. No one in the auditor-controller's office could be 
reached for comment. But Spears said he learned late Wednesday that the office 
is planning to start releasing money collected after the bankruptcy was filed 
-- including Schaum's -- early next week. The fate of awards collected before 
Dec. 6 remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been no hue and cry" among plaintiffs yet, Spears said. In fact, 
before a reporter made an inquiry, Spears thought that judgments were being 
paid as usual. Apparently, checks to plaintiffs were being issued immediately 
after the Dec. 6 bankruptcy filing but were stopped sometime later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaum got the bad news just a few days before Christmas when he called the 
auditor's office to inquire about his money. He had wanted the extra cash for 
the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just astounded," he said. "I said, 'What do you mean you're not writing 
any checks?' They said, 'We're broke.' " 
</P>
<P>
 From the get-go, this has not been an easy quest for Schaum. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the company that owed Schaum a commission for work he did as a 
contractor had its accounts frozen by court order as a result of a lawsuit by 
the state attorney general's office. So he pursued a small-claims action 
against the company, Nationwide Mortgage Group Inc., in Harbor Municipal Court 
to recover the $5,015 he was owed. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaum said that he won the case Oct. 12 and that the county marshal's office 
seized the only funds it could from a company bank account -- $1,146 and 
change. The money was forwarded to the county auditor's office for processing 
on Dec. 15 -- but the bucks stopped there. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaum believes his money should have been held in a separate account so that 
it would not have been affected by the county's financial misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that if an attorney or a real estate agent or somebody in the private 
sector did this, it would be looked upon as a criminal offense," he said.

O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; OFFICIALS PLAN CAREER PLACEMENT CENTER; SERVICES: WITH 
LAYOFFS IMMINENT, EMPLOYMENT MATERIALS WILL BE CONSOLIDATED IN COUNTY ARCHIVES 
ROOM. LIBRARIAN EXPRESSES HOPE THERE WILL BE LITTLE NEED FOR IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County officials, anticipating post-New Year's employee layoffs, plan 
to open a temporary career placement center Tuesday in the Old County 
Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given so much is unknown about this process . . . we're going to have to be 
real flexible," said John Adams, the county librarian."Hopefully there will be 
so little need for it that we can close it up real quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said the idea for an "outplacement" center was hatched by his 
department, which has not been informed if it will need to make cuts, and the 
county's Human Resource Department last Friday, after the announcement that 
about $40 million -- and a number of jobs -- would be sliced from the county's 
budget in the first round of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Career placement materials from the county's branch libraries -- as well as 
the librarians who are familiar with them -- will be consolidated in the County 
Archives, in Room 108 in the basement of the red-brick former courthouse at 211 
W. Santa Ana Blvd., Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also will include local newspaper want ads, the National Employment 
Weekly distributed by the Wall Street Journal and career planning books. A 
computer will be available for the preparation of resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 County department heads have been asked to report by Jan. 10 to the Board of 
Supervisors on proposed cutbacks in their operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said he hopes to have the center running Tuesday, although he does not 
know when decisions on layoffs will come. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will be open on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll probably be ready before we're needed," said Adams, who hopes to keep 
the center open as long as necessary.

TOUGH NEW LAWS TARGET DANGEROUS DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE SEO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tough new state laws that go into effect Jan. 1 could help get dangerous 
drivers like Dr. Ronald Allen off the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting at midnight on New Year's Eve, those caught driving without a license 
or with a suspended or revoked license will lose their car for 30 days. After 
the second offense, they'll lose their car for good. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the crash that killed a Mission Viejo couple and critically 
injured their daughter and hurt two others, Allen did not have a valid driver's 
license, authorities said. On Wednesday, Allen was convicted on two counts of 
second-degree murder for causing the deaths of Mark and Noreen Minzey while 
driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a bill that could prevent crimes like that one from taking place," 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who wrote the law requiring vehicles to be 
confiscated, said Wednesday. "We're going to stop such crimes because we're 
going to be taking cars away from those who choose to drive without a valid 
license." 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993 -- the month before the crash -- Allen lost his license after he 
was arrested in Laguna Beach on suspicion of public intoxication, hit-and-run 
driving and resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new law doesn't specifically address drunk driving cases, Katz 
said his legislation and another bill carried by state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp 
(I-San Francisco), which calls for the cars of first-time offenders to be 
impounded for 30 days, should help keep drunk drivers off the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 There are an estimated 1.7 million California motorists with no licenses or 
with revoked or suspended licenses, Katz said. Of those, 750,000 lost their 
driving privileges because of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 DMV estimates that about three-fourths of those who have had their licenses 
suspended because of drunk driving will continue to drive. And those people are 
four times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some say what we're doing is tough," Katz said at a news conference in Los 
Angeles. "But the situation calls for drastic measures. . . . (These drivers) 
are a threat to every man, woman and child, and they need to be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Although supporting the new laws, Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. Robert 
Molko is skeptical whether they will stop motorists like Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if that's the end-all solution," said Molko, who prosecuted 
Allen. "Because as I know Dr. Allen, he would have driven whether he had a 
license or not." 
</P>
<P>
 The Minzeys were on their way home when their car was struck head-on by 
Allen's vehicle on Santiago Canyon Road. The crash left their daughter Karie 
Minzey, now 12, critically injured. Two family friends who were in the car also 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union has no plans to challenge the new laws, but 
will be "intently watching how the law is put into effect," said Allan 
Parachini, public affairs director of the ACLU of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the (Katz) bill was somewhat tempered during the last six months, it's 
still not a bill we can support," Parachini said. "There has been a great deal 
of talking tough and passing laws that appear to do something but really 
don't." 
</P>
<P>
 But Reidel Post, executive director of Orange County's Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving, believes the effort will keep unlawful motorists off the roads because 
"their weapons will be taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's been a long time coming," she said. "Our society needs this 
because people who have had their licenses suspended lost their driving 
privileges for a reason."

STUDENTS HIT THE BOOKS FOR MORE THAN AN EDUCATION; TRENDS: MANY APPEAR TO TAKE 
REFUGE IN THE CAMPUS ROUTINE, ESPECIALLY IN TROUBLED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL TIMES.

 When Carol Ziehm graduated from Mission Viejo High School, the effect was like 
stepping off the curb into oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world was confusing," says Ziehm, of Mission Viejo. "I felt kind of lost. 
I just wasn't sure what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by the A+ she had received in a high school accounting class, right out 
of high school she enrolled at Saddleback Community College in Mission Viejo 
and in two years received an associate's degree in business. But figuring out 
how to apply it to the real world beyond college was daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't lead anywhere, so I just kept taking classes," says Ziehm, 39, who 
says she spent many years as a "professional student." "I figured there had to 
be something out there that was fulfilling and rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
 For many, school provides a certain predictable structure that makes it a cozy 
and safe alternative to the real world with its corporate downsizing, deficit 
trade imbalance and a shaky Social Security system. School dictates where to 
go, what to do, when to do your homework and go to bed. It is more than an 
education in biology and economics. It teaches organization, discipline, time 
and money management. 
</P>
<P>
 Many appear to make a profession of being a student, especially in troubled 
economic and social times. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many students, Ziehm recalls her early college years as a time to do some 
serious thinking about herself. She says the time was right for it: a 
melancholia surrounded the end of the Vietnam War, and the president, once a 
figure of authority and respect, was resigning from the White House in shame, a 
cartoonish figure satirized in Mad Magazine. Ziehm says she felt the world was 
an unsafe and untrustworthy place, and she continued to seek comfort and 
protection in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saddleback was always there," Ziehm says. "Education was great no matter how 
you felt about the world. I felt very lucky to have the community college 
available to me. It was a place to take your time and excel and find your 
niche." 
</P>
<P>
 Marian Salzman, president and founder of BKG America, a market research firm 
based in New York that studies trends of the twentysomething generation, says, 
"There are so many freeways to becoming a smart, enlightened person. Formal 
school is only one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Salzman says many young people stay in school because it is an acceptable form 
of soul-searching in the years after high school. "We all seem to need a 
label," Salzman says. " 'Student' seems to be more acceptable than perhaps 
'slacker.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of my friends don't want to deal with the routine of the real world," 
says Kurt Hueg, public information officer at Saddleback and a 1986 UCLA grad. 
He admits many of his fellow graduates, though they hold degrees from a 
competitive school, are underemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than committing to a career, Hueg says, "They seem to have spent the 
last few years just having a good time. School was a lot of fun. But now that 
they're hitting 30, they're beginning to sacrifice their idealism and start 
dealing with the reality of their careers." 
</P>
<P>
 Hueg laments that students fees at the community college level and tuition at 
four-year universities are going up, up, up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fees per unit of credit were less than $10. Now they're $13, and (Gov. Pete) 
Wilson wants it to go to $20," Hueg says. "We may be seeing an end to the 
professional student -- certainly no one at USC or CSU can afford it." 
</P>
<P>
 While community colleges offer a cheaper opportunity to bide time between high 
school and the real world, four-year universities and graduate schools also 
attract the professional student, says Anna Garza, director of the career 
development center at Chapman University in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time the economy is poor, we see applications to the graduate school 
rise," Garza says. "People don't think there are jobs. They are waiting it out 
until this thing blows over.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Garza says many of Chapman's 3,200 students arrive on campus with a sense of 
timing, as if their lives were chartered on a narrow course -- bachelor's 
degree by age 22, graduate school in two years, then an entry-level position 
with the right company, marriage, family, et cetera. But, she says, many 
students are mystified when that first job isn't waiting for them as soon as 
they frame their degree and hang it on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not getting jobs right away, and it's very stressful," Garza says. 
"Parents don't understand why it's so hard, unless they themselves have been 
laid off." 
</P>
<P>
 Garza says factors such as the bankruptcy of Orange County may dishearten 
college students, who may indeed opt for more college instead of venturing into 
an economy they perceive as being depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many recent grads want to come back here to work because they see this as a 
warm, protective environment," Garza says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel Strong, 23, of Santa Ana, says: "One of the scariest things is to not 
go to school every day. It's been my security blanket for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong got her associate's degree from Fullerton College and will receive a 
bachelor's in public relations from Chapman University this spring. Her 
question is not if she should pursue her master's degree, but when.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in a big hurry to start a family," says Strong, who married two years 
ago and just purchased a home with her husband, Robert, an engineer technician 
for a computer hardware company. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong's mother was her age when she dropped out of college to start a family. 
She never went back to school, but instead took a job as a cashier with the 
Automobile Assn. of America, where she has been for 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be stuck behind a desk," says Strong, who dreams of being a 
public information officer for a police department. After six years of college, 
she has had four majors -- beginning with pre-med, she also pursued graphic 
arts and something else (she doesn't remember what) before settling on public 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may as well keep going, since I'm in the mode," Strong says. "But I don't 
want to get too many degrees because I heard the more degrees one has, the 
harder it is to get a job because employers think then they have to pay you 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 Market researcher Salzman admits well-paying jobs are few and far between, 
even for those who graduated from the most prestigious universities. "Young 
people starting out today know there are no guarantees. They've watched as so 
many of their parents are laid off from companies they've worked for for 20, 30 
or 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important no matter what the climate to get out there and travel 
and learn to support oneself, rather than stay in school," Salzman says. 
"Personally, I think everyone should spend at least a year as a waitress."

POSITIVE THINKING; IN A DIVISION OF THE MORGAN AGENCY IN COSTA MESA, 
HEALTHY-LOOKING MODELS PUT ANOTHER FACE ON HIV AND AIDS 
</P>

 Model Rebekka Armstrong leaned over to give a photographer a hug after a long 
afternoon photo session. But she fell forward and stumbled. "Sorry," she said 
softly, "it's the dementia." She wasn't whirling from a hard day's work. 
Rebekka Armstrong has AIDS, and she is suffering from one of its side effects. 
The conversations that followed were not about her eyes, her makeup or her best 
side. She chatted about doctors, drugs and T-cell counts, and it was clear that 
this former Playboy Playmate is a giant reality-check apart from the hoard of 
other hopefuls striking a pose to make a buck. After her diagnosis in 1989, she 
was alone. Less than a year ago, she drank a case of beer daily, lived in 
residential back yards and "never talked to anyone." Now, she's among the 40 
models age 20 to 45 in the Proof Positive Division of the Morgan Agency in 
Costa Mesa, a group of people with HIV and AIDS who hope their fresh, healthy 
appearance will spread a stronger message about the virus that has infected an 
estimated 750,000 to 1 million people nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The men have muscles and rugged good looks, and the women sparkle with the 
healthy complexions of a Noxzema ad. They are the new faces of HIV -- quite a 
contrast from the image of emaciated patients dying in hospital beds, said 
Morgan Agency president Keith Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the Proof Positive division, Lewis said, came to him after he had 
received a steadily increasing number of calls for HIV-positive models to 
promote products marketed for the AIDS community. Since the division was 
formed, many of the Proof Positive models have also promoted other products and 
companies not affiliated with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many people out there living with the disease (who) don't fill a 
certain stereotype," Lewis said. "They are very conscious about their health, 
and we think it's important to show them. We feel good about ushering in the 
new face of HIV." 
</P>
<P>
 After Lewis began his search for HIV-infected models to start the division a 
year ago, he said there were a few agency clients that were "a little nervous" 
about having models with the virus working at the Morgan Agency. But as the 
months passed, the models have been accepted in the industry, and the Proof 
Positive division is the fastest growing segment of the agency, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the Proof Positive division, Lewis said, came to him after he had 
received a steadily increasing number of calls for HIV-positive models to 
promote products marketed for the AIDS community. Since the division was 
formed, many of the Proof Positive models have been hired on their looks alone 
to promoted other products and companies not affiliated with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said he met controversy after one of the Proof Positive models appeared 
in a national ad that critics say exploits the afflicted and incites fear among 
HIV-infected patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad, featuring Christopher Crays of Costa Mesa, was for Advera, a 
nutritional supplement promoted by Ross Products Division of Abbott 
Laboratories as effective against progressive weight loss. Progressive weight 
loss, or wasting syndrome, leads to malnutrition, one of the leading causes of 
AIDS-related deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The print ad shows Crays, wearing a tank top and gym shorts, sitting on the 
living room floor next to a pair of running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never worried too much about nutrition," the ad reads. "Then my doctor told 
me I was HIV-positive. Now I do everything I can to maintain my energy, 
strength and quality of life." The national campaign has taken most of its hits 
from John Stansell, M.D., medical director of San Francisco General Hospital's 
AIDS Clinic, who calls the disease-specific pitch "a disgusting distortion." 
</P>
<P>
 "The advertising gives the impression that every HIV-positive person needs to 
be taking supplements," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Advera is a good product. But most (HIV) patients don't need Advera if they 
eat balanced meals," he said. "When I heard the radio ads, I was really angry. 
It was the way they pitched it to the entire HIV community, as if all patients 
needed it. They used fear, really, I believe, to turn a profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither executives from Ross Products or LCF & L, the New York agency that 
created the ad, returned phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Crays, 35, who has been HIV-positive for more than six years, said he is proud 
of the campaign, the product and his recognition as "the Advera man." He said 
that he and a lot of other HIV-positive patients are taking a proactive 
approach to their health instead of a reactive one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The likelihood is that this (virus) is probably going to kick me in the butt. 
I don't want to live my life like that," said Crays, who also heads the Life 
AIDS Lobby in Sacramento. "Nutrition is a very important part of my life."  
</P>
<P>
 It is believed to be the first time that ads for an AIDS-related product have 
been marketed in the mass media, rather than being placed only in gay and 
lesbian publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Crays said the Advera campaign was also the largest in the history of the 
epidemic, something he considers an encouraging breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although some people might be nervous, it's been a positive thing for all of 
us. We have to get rid of this perception that we are all wasting away or on 
our deathbeds. . . . This is not a 'them' disease; this is an 'us' disease," 
Crays said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proof Positive is the Morgan Agency's fastest growing division both in model 
count and agency revenue, generating 10% of the talent and modeling agency's 
business, Lewis said. He interviews all Proof Positive applicants at length, 
and only those who are comfortable with their HIV-positive status are signed 
with the 466-client agency. As far as exploitation, he said, there is none. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exploitation comes through ignorance. This is about education," he said. "I'm 
able to go to bed at night and feel good about what I'm doing. I'm giving 
something back by sending a message to everyone that this could be you (with 
HIV), and hopefully restoring a certain amount of dignity along the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis also said that using models who have HIV in AIDS-related ads and public 
service announcements requires an honesty that isn't always present in the 
advertising business. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have to use models with HIV; they can hire actors to say they do," 
he said. "But by using (models with HIV), we are offering a more accurate 
portrayal." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a growing demographic out there in the mainstream, and using models 
with HIV to reach them helps them and gives the models work they might not have 
gotten," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former real estate finance attorney Jim Ballard of Hollywood, who set a 
short-course 100-meter backstroke world record for his age group at Gay Games 
IV, is among those who have signed with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing 6 foot 4, the boyishly handsome Ballard is one of the division's most 
successful models, currently promoting his own greeting card line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a model. I'm a face to connect with an epidemic," said Ballard, 36. 
"And this really isn't about modeling. It's a way to say that there are people 
out there with HIV. This could be anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Ballard practiced law for 10 years in a large Los Angeles firm before fatigue 
and other symptoms of the virus made it too difficult to handle the 60- to 
80-hour weeks that came with the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't really say that I like doing this more than practicing law; I love 
law. But I feel good about this and the message we're sending," he said. "It's 
very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Smith, 29, a Costa Mesa home health-care worker, said with a smile 
that he also isn't a model, just an average guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was first diagnosed, it was hard for me because I work with AIDS 
patients, and that's all I saw," he said. "I would go to work and think, 'God, 
that's going to be me.' But now I say, 'I'm not a victim. It's not my whole 
life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he was feeling tired and getting some other blood tests three years 
ago, so he had the doctor test him for HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even give that test a second thought. I know people who are tested 
and agonize over it. I was sure it was negative," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who has also modeled for Advera, said working with the division has 
been a positive experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "If my face or my voice can tell people that anyone can get (HIV), I'll be 
happy," he said. "I don't see it as exploitative at all. It's informative." 
</P>
<P>
 Giggling, and typing up her bio in the Morgan Agency's booking room, Feliece 
Jones of Thousand Oaks has a smile that fits right in with the hundreds of 
8-by-10 glossies on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a very spiritual person, so I don't think about dying," said Jones, one 
of the newest Proof Positive models. "That's just not me. But if seeing my face 
can show people out there that they better get tested and protect themselves, 
then I'm happy to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong pushed aside a strand of long, wavy hair and spoke with innocent 
candor about AIDS and how it's affected her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found out, I hit the floor, literally," she said. "Then I hit 
rock-bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 She's not sure how she contracted the virus, she said, adding that that 
doesn't really matter. What matters to her now is staying healthy and speaking 
to teen-agers about HIV, protection and spreading the it-could-be-you message 
to everyone who will listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "When these kids come up to me after I speak, they say that it really means 
something to them that someone like me has this virus," she said. "That's 
really important to me, that I got through to them."  
</P>
<P>
 Like the other models in the Proof Positive division, Armstrong has to worry 
about symptoms of the virus and how it affects her appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This morning, I saw this little crack in the corner of my mouth, and I 
thought, not my face, " she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballard said he doesn't worry too much about small physical imperfections 
because "that's what the airbrush is for."

OFF THE CUFF; REAL HERO SAVES HIS OWN SKIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five thousand years ago -- even before soap -- Egyptians were using oils made 
from fruits and nuts to perfume and soften their skin. Women have long known 
that moisturizers of any sort can smooth skin and fight aging. And these days, 
men are more open to the benefits of indulging their outer layer.  
</P>
<P>
 Debra Albee, manager of Aveda Ethetique in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, has 
seen an increase in the number of men seeking skin-care products during her 
15-year career. When she started, Albee says, products were geared toward 
women: "Men were still in the soap-and-water mode," she explains. Now, many 
companies offer a line of men's skin-care products.  
</P>
<P>
 Aveda (the name comes from the term "ayurvedic," which means the science of 
longevity) apparently believes in equal opportunity; all its products are 
designed to be used by both sexes. Albee says she uses the after-shave balm and 
shave emollient on her legs. "They create a nice barrier between the razor and 
the skin. The balm is moisturizing, soothing and cooling; there is no alcohol," 
she says.  
</P>
<P>
 This is another in a series of first-person columns that allows people 
connected to the fashion industry to talk about their encounters.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost the new year, and if I were to give men any advice it would be: 
"Be aware of your skin, and don't be afraid to look like someone who takes care 
of his skin." It's not frivolous; it's important. 
</P>
<P>
 What you put on your skin day after day, year after year, makes a difference. 
Once in a while it's OK to use mediocre products, but on a long-term basis, if 
you use mediocre products, that's what your skin will look like. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything that stays on your skin for more than 10 minutes will go into your 
body. Your skin is not waterproof; things penetrate. If it's a pure, natural 
and plant-derived product, rather than a synthetic product or one with 
petrochemicals or pesticides, it won't clog your pores, and it will let your 
skin breathe. And pure products are antibacterial; they purify and deodorize 
your skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Men would benefit from using a gel cleanser that detoxifies their skin from 
any buildup created during the day or by working out or from pollutants in the 
air. Also, they would benefit from using exfoliates daily to slough off dead 
skin cells and bring new ones to the surface. Although shaving removes dead 
skin cells in the beard area, men need exfoliates for the eye area, forehead 
and nose. 
</P>
<P>
 And men would benefit from using daily hydrating lotions and a sunscreen. In 
Southern California, we are all exposed to elements that cause aging and 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 To pamper themselves, men can use massage products to replace moisture in 
their skin. We have one that we think energizes and one that soothes. We also 
have plant and flower "Pure-fumes" that appeal to some men because the scents 
are forest, spice and herbal. We incorporate essential oils in these aromas. 
They are not your basic smells. 
</P>
<P>
 We also have aroma-free products for people with sensitive skin or for those 
who don't want a scent on them.
