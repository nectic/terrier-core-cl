 MEDFLY, BE GONE: Aerial malathion spraying will be a twice-monthly fact of 
life in Camarillo, as Ventura County seeks to wipe out a Medfly infestation. . 
. . For local car washers, the regular dousing of pesticide and corn syrup 
could mean boffo business. . . . Although many residents cover their cars with 
tarps, some car owners could be caught unaware. . . . Lewis Jensen of the 
Ponderosa Car Wash planned to double his employees after the first spray. 
"We'll have to crank it up a little bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 FAMILY TIES: Fillmore is extolling family values -- and residents are being 
encouraged to get with the program. . . . City leaders are asking families to 
set aside every Sunday night as family night, when parents and children discuss 
love, self-esteem -- and maybe even sit down together for dinner. . . . TV and 
Nintendo are out, and civic groups are being asked to avoid scheduling 
activities that would take people away from home. "We don't want to dictate to 
anybody," Mayor Linda Brewster said. ". . . But we think this is a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
 ISLAND COUNT: Who knows what lurks in the depths of the kelp forests off 
Channel Islands National Park? . . . No one has a precise inventory, but 
researchers are trying to take stock (Ventura County Life, Page 8). They're 
also cataloguing local flora and fauna. . . . Scientists from around the 
country visited Anacapa Island recently to check out the monitoring efforts. 
"It's the sort of information that's expensive to obtain, but priceless to 
have," parks official William Tweed said. 
</P>
<P>
 QUICK STUDY: He's lived in the United States for less than a year, but Ventura 
College water polo player Pedro de Lima has already learned how to blend in 
(C10). . . . As a two-meter man on the college's water polo team, the 
19-year-old Brazilian has led the sixth-ranked Pirates in scoring this season. 
An avid player since the age of 12, de Lima got off to a fast start in Ventura, 
Coach Larry Baratte said. " I could tell right away he was real good."

 Boot Camp for Chefs 
</P>
<P>
 French chef Madeleine Kamman's legendary School for American Chefs, held at 
the Beringer Vineyards in Napa Valley, is inviting young chefs to submit 
applications for a two-week intensive course in topics ranging from the 
business of running a restaurant to food science and history. Admission is by 
scholarship only (students pay for their own transportation and lodging). 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants must be working chefs with at least two years of professional 
experience. The deadline for applications is Nov. 15. For application 
information, call Debra Murphy at (707) 963-7115. The First Dry Soda 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1860s, when people were just becoming aware of microorganisms, a 
Harvard science professor named Eben Horsford warned that yeast was related to 
poisonous molds -- as if that made it poison too -- and recommended that people 
make bread with a baking powder consisting of sodium bicarbonate and 
monocalcium phosphate ("pulverulent phosphoric acid") . . . which he just 
happened to manufacture. So maybe he was sort of a crank, but in marketing his 
product at least he did come up with the process that keeps baking soda from 
absorbing moisture in the can. Boil All Ferns! 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 diners at a restaurant in Steuben Co., New York, ate an appetizer of 
fiddlehead fern, a traditional Canadian seasonal delicacy, and later complained 
of diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The fiddleheads had been lightly sauteed for 
two minutes with butter, garlic, salt and pepper; a nearby restaurant that 
served ferns boiled and then sauteed reported no illness among its patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration is attempting to isolate the toxin. The 
Centers for Disease Control recommends boiling fiddleheads at least 10 minutes 
before eating. How to Pop Your Lid 
</P>
<P>
 Rubbermaid's Servin' Saver EZ Topps Rounds is sort of a mouthful, but the name 
is worth knowing for people who have trouble opening regular refrigerator 
containers . . . or just want to protect their fingernails. The lids have an 
extended vertical tab, which can be opened by pressing with the side of one 
hand; all but the smallest size -- there are eight, from 7-ounce to 1.4-quart 
-- can also be popped open by pressing it against a countertop. They're 
freezer- and dishwasher-safe and microwaveable (remove the lid first). In 
stores such as Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target. Hey, Whatever's Green 
</P>

 "Entertaining With Regis and Kathie Lee" by Regis Philbin & Kathie Lee Gifford 
(Hyperion; 272 pages), published today, is a followup to "Cooking With Regis 
and Kathie Lee" that concentrates on holiday and party meals. The TV duo offer 
a lot of entertaining ideas here, but some are on the strange side. For St. 
Patrick's day they suggest giving all your guests a temporary Irish name ("Mr. 
O'Steinberg" or "Mrs. O'Capparelle") while playing a Sinead O'Connor CD and 
serving either Irish stew or Italian gnocchi all'ortolana , followed by Kermit 
the Frog's shoo-fly pie. In bookstores. CHARLES PERRY

 The front labels of the 1993 Chardonnay and 1992 Meritage red wine blend may 
not prominently name the winery, but the wines are made by the well-known 
Silverado Vineyards of the Napa Valley. They make the purpose of the wines 
clear, anyway, with an artist's conception of the future home of the L.A. 
Philharmonic Orchestra, which will be named the Walt Disney Concert Hall.About 
50% of the proceeds from every bottle goes to the Philharmonic. It's 
appropriate that the wines are made by Silverado, since that winery is owned by 
the family of the late film and amusement park executive, Lillian Disney, and 
her daughter and son-in-law, Diane and Ron Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Those wanting to buy some of the specially crafted wines may order 12-bottle 
cases at $150 or half cases at $80, including sales tax and delivery, by 
mailing a check to Business and Professional Committee, Los Angeles 
Philharmonic, 555 Van Ness Ave., Torrance, Calif. 90501. Telephone orders: 
(213) 850-2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, the wines are truly magnificent. DAN BERGER

GRILLING ON THE RIM; BARBECUE: THE ASIAN PALETTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Grilling -- all year long it's a great way to cook. When the sun sets early, 
turn on the lights. Too cold? Bundle up. Rain? A determined griller carries on 
somehow. I'm thinking of the street vendor in Krabi, a town in southern 
Thailand, who turned out succulent meat on a stick even when his grill-cart was 
veiled with drizzle from a passing monsoon. 
</P>
<P>
 In America, the barbecue is an appliance of choice. In Asia, it can be an 
appliance of necessity. Third-World homes are not necessarily equipped with a 
range, or even a kitchen as we know it. A grill may be the only way to cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Then too, Asian grills can fill a room with strong aromas and smoke from the 
high heat required for stir-frying. Consequently, some of the wealthy have two 
kitchens, one for general cooking and a breezy, open area for grilling and wok 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Five-star restaurants may have the same arrangement. In Bangkok, one eatery 
popular with farangs (foreigners) provides air-conditioned luxury up front. 
Orders for sate, though, are not cooked in the large, well-equipped kitchen but 
on a charcoal grill out back under an umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grilling is so prevalent in Bangkok that it seems the pollution there must 
have a strong charcoal element. Sidewalk vendors line busy streets barbecuing 
chicken, meat, squid, shrimp, fish balls, sausages, ears of corn, bananas in 
the peel and more. 
</P>
<P>
 In Indonesia, itinerant sate cooks carry grills balanced on shoulder poles. 
Unlike our round or large rectangular barbecues, the most efficient grill for 
sate is long and narrow, designed to hold the sticks in a row. The ends of the 
skewers extend over the sides, making it easy to turn them without getting 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
 One thinks of sate as chunks or slices of meat. But on Bali and adjacent 
Lombok Island, a popular variation is sate lilit -- ground meat on a stick. 
Actually, the meat is not ground but pounded in a mortar until the fibers break 
down and the meat becomes soft enough to mold onto skewers. In the Balinese 
village of Kemenuh, cooking teacher Ibu Mas showed me how to do this. We cooked 
the sate on a tiny grill on the sidewalk outside the kitchen. Long enough to 
hold perhaps a dozen sticks, shallow enough to require little fuel (Ibu used 
coconut husks), the grills cost only $1.50 at the local market. 
</P>
<P>
 To obtain steady heat, cooks encourage the coals with whatever is handy -- a 
fan woven from palm fronds, a wooden board or a piece of cardboard. At outdoor 
hawker centers in Singapore, sate grillers sometimes use their fans to create 
showy bursts of flame -- an image so emblematic it's used in promoting tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Philippines, gas stoves are relatively new arrivals. Until then, the 
alternative was the barbecue, says Filipino food expert Joyce R. Lapus of 
Manila. What often turns up on Philippine grills is bangus (milkfish) wrapped 
in banana leaves and topped with tomatoes, onion and a squeeze of calamansi 
juice.  
</P>
<P>
 Lapus' great-grandmother founded the Aristocrat, a restaurant in Manila famous 
for barbecued chicken and pork, and her grandmother is the Mama Sita whose name 
appears on a line of Filipino seasonings. Mama Sita's barbecue marinade is 
composed of soy sauce, garlic, sugar and pepper. Add more sugar, and it will 
resemble the marinade used at the Aristocrat, Lapus promises. The truth is, the 
small, juicy chickens grilled at the Aristocrat are as important as the 
seasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 In Asia, menus travel. For example, in northeastern Thailand, barbecued 
chicken is eaten with a spicy green papaya salad pounded in a mortar, called 
som tam , and glutinous rice. At the Aristocrat in Manila, barbecued chicken is 
served with a green papaya salad called atsara and java rice tinted orange with 
annatto. Both papaya salads have sweet-sour dressings. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of their sunny climate, Filipinos have many opportunities to grill. 
But in a congested city such as Tokyo, where winter can be harsh, outdoor 
cooking is impractical. The Japanese manage by using oven broilers and 
range-top grills, says Matao Uwate, a cooking teacher, cookbook writer, radio 
personality and champion of Japanese food in Los Angeles for more than 40 
years. Japanese markets here stock grills composed of a shallow pan with a 
grate on top. Small and easy to clean, they require little storage space. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some restaurants, such as Nanbantei of Tokyo, specialize in grilling over 
charcoal -- not ordinary coals but bincho , a fine hardwood from Wakayama on 
the southern coast of Honshu. Bincho is expensive but burns for a long time and 
provides intense, steady heat. Bincho is so prestigious that restaurants 
display a plaque to let customers know they use it. Such a plaque -- in 
Japanese -- is mounted on the tiled wall near the grill at Nanbantei's branch 
in L.A.'s Little Tokyo. Similar wooden plaques list tidbits available from the 
grill: tsukune (chicken meatballs), chicken wings, asparagus wrapped in 
tissue-thin pork and slices of chicken breast sandwiched with shiso leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottled Korean marinades, available in most Asian markets, have made Korean 
barbecue almost as familiar as teriyaki. Koreans may grill at home but are more 
likely to go to a restaurant, says Moon Sook Chung of Surabul restaurant in Los 
Angeles. Besides, it's fun to join in the cooking around the tabletop grills. 
Along with platters of marinated meat come rice, soup and many side dishes -- 
salads, marinated vegetables, bits of seafood and one or more versions of the 
spicy pickle kimchi. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean barbecued beef is well known, but sweet-hot pork grilled until the 
edges turn crisp and caramelized is irresistable. Funny thing is, Koreans don't 
think highly of this dish. In Korea, pork costs much less than short ribs ( 
kalbi ) and is not regarded as classy food, says Chung. Beef is seasoned with 
gentle respect, but pork is nearly overwhelmed by the fiercest seasonings: big 
spoonfuls of fiery chile powder, bean paste loaded with chile, and grated 
ginger root. To my way of thinking, this bolder treatment produces sublime 
results. 
</P>
<P>

 Kyung Lee, chef at Surabul Korean restaurant, says that for best flavor, the 
meat should marinate at least eight hours.

 Narin Chotipanang, chef-owner of Mangkoode restaurant in Bangkok, molds fish 
paste onto thick sticks for this unusual sate. Chotipanang pounds the fish to a 
paste in a mortar, then mixes it with pounded seasonings and bastes it with 
coconut milk as it cooks on the grill. The Thai fish that he uses is not 
available here, but black cod worked well in a test of the recipe. The fish can 
be molded onto thick wooden chopsticks, available in any Asian market.

 "It's really a simple dish," says Andre Guerrero, talking about his recipe for 
Filipino - style grilled pork chops. "The marinade is just vinegar, garlic and 
pepper, but it changes the flavor so much." Born in Quezon City just outside 
Manila, Guerrero is chef-owner of Duet restaurant in Glendale. Pork Inihaw is 
not on the menu there but is always available because customers demand it, he 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero grills lean meat, but in the Philippines, fatty cuts are preferred 
because the drippings sizzling onto the coals enhance smokiness. Guerrero 
paints meat with olive oil for a similar but more healthful effect.

 Matao Uwate operates the Japanese Cooking School in Los Angeles and talks 
about food weekly on Radio Li'l Tokyo. Here is his recipe for grilled chicken 
balls similar to those served at Nanbantei of Tokyo in Little Tokyo' s Weller 
Court . Uwate explains that the quality of tare, the dipping sauce that seasons 
the chicken, reveals the caliber of the chef. This is an easy version for home 
cooks. The amount of sugar should be adjusted according to the sweetness of the 
mirin in the tare.

 Kenji Salz, executive chef of the Four Seasons Resort in Bali, came to Los 
Angeles in September to cook at Spago and Chinois. During his stay, Salz 
demonstrated Bali's distinctive sate lilit, molding meat paste around flat 
wooden sate sticks that he had brought from Bali. For shrimp sate, he used 
lemon grass stalks.  
</P>
<P>
 Salz seasons the meat with a spice paste traditionally used for betutu, which 
is Balinese roast duck. His sate may seem complicated to prepare, but the 
results are worth it.  
</P>
<P>
 Leftover betutu spice paste can be used with baked chicken and is excellent 
with the duck legs available in Asian markets. Bake the duck legs at 325 
degrees 45 minutes to melt the fat. Place the well-drained legs on a large 
sheet of foil. Spread some of spice paste on each side and season to taste with 
salt. Wrap with foil, place in a baking pan and bake at 325 degrees 45 minutes. 
Uncover and bake 30 minutes longer, or until browned.  
</P>

GRILLING ON THE RIM; CHOOSING SIDES

<P>
 When you're planning an Asian dinner, what type of meat to grill can be an 
easy decision: Just follow your hankering. What to serve with it may take more 
thought. In their appealing small book, "The Asian Grill" (Chronicle Books: 
$12.95), David Barich and Thomas Ingalls take on both issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve menus pair such main dishes as Thai dancing prawns, Chinese barbecued 
spare ribs and five-spice grilled game hens with Asian-inspired rice, noodles, 
salads and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 To accompany Thai barbecued chicken, there's a jasmine rice salad that 
includes lots of things you'd find in an Asian marketplace: snow peas, mango, 
cucumber, coconut and bean sprouts. A carrot-and-radish salad goes with 
Vietnamese barbecued beef; cold Japanese somen noodles and a wasabi-spiced dip 
accompany chicken teriyaki, and Chinese broccoli with black bean sauce goes 
alongside Chinese grilled whole fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Barich and Ingalls tested their recipes on a standard American kettle-style 
grill. Their recipes require no special cooking tools, but they do recommend 
using natural-hardwood charcoal, preferably mesquite because it burns hotter, 
making it easier to sear foods. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Along with grilling pointers, there are sources for grills, accessories, 
charcoal, smoking woods and naturally raised meats. Each menu is handsomely 
photographed. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The authors suggest these noodles would go well with grilled eggplant and 
grilled salmon with miso.  
</P>
<P>
 STIR-FRIED SOBA NOODLES 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound soba noodles 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons Japanese soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon minced ginger root 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons sake 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons peanut oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup bean sprouts 
</P>
<P>
 Bring large pot salted water to boil. Add noodles, stirring to separate. When 
water returns to boil, cook noodles 6 to 8 minutes or until tender. Drain. 
Rinse noodles in cold water. Drain well. Set aside. In small bowl combine soy 
sauce, sugar, ginger and sake. 
</P>
<P>
 In wok or large skillet heat oil over medium-high heat until it sizzles. Toss 
in drained noodles and stir-fry 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in soy sauce mixture and 
stir-fry 2 to 3 minutes. Add bean sprouts and stir-fry 1 minute. Serve warm. 
Makes 4 servings.

minutes, or until tender. Place in colander, rinse under cold water and press 
with back of wooden spoon to remove excess water. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat dry, heavy skillet over medium high-heat. Add sesame seeds and stir 
constantly 3 to 4 minutes, or until they begin to toast. Remove pan from heat

 Grilling is a delicious and easy alternative to frying chicken. Baste the 
chicken generously during cooking to keep it moist and impart the smoky-hot 
taste of this honey-mustard barbecue sauce. GRILLED CHICKEN 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 large garlic clove, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon prepared Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons honey 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup tomato sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 chicken 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in small pan. Add garlic and saute over low heat 1 minute. Add red 
pepper flakes, mustard, honey, lemon juice, tomato sauce and Worcestershire. 
Simmer 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare grill for indirect cooking (bank coals on sides and place drip pan in 
center). Place chicken on grill, skin side up, and baste generously with sauce. 
Cover and cook 30 to 40 minutes, basting every 10 minutes. Turn chicken bone 
side up and grill until done, about 5 minutes. Makes 2 servings.

 Got the rhythm yet? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, you wake up, shower, grab a cup of coffee and a piece of toast and 
hit the highway. Work, work, work. Grab a quick lunch. Work, work, work. Drive 
home. Drive the kids to swimming/soccer/drama practice. Come back for a little 
algebra review (2(3-4x) + -3(7x+8)=-7, solve and show your work) and maybe some 
history (Did Columbus discover America? Careful now . . .). Watch "Frasier." 
Put the kids to bed. Grab a half-hour's reading and ZONK. 
</P>
<P>
 Are we forgetting something? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, right, dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not seem fair, but you've still got to eat. What's even worse, 
somewhere in that mess of scheduling somebody's got to cook. (What's that you 
say? Why don't you just microwave something and eat during the commercials? 
We'll pretend we didn't hear that.) 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, this is not the time to break out a new cookbook, to search the 
market for the best in seasonal produce, or to indulge the whims of culinary 
fancy. Save those for the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution in times like these is to have fallback dishes -- things you can 
put together without really having to think. Food you can fix in your sleep 
(or, more accurately, while you're wishing you could go to sleep). 
</P>
<P>
 In our house, weekday dinners tend to revolve around goat cheese quesadillas 
(we're not snooty -- for years my daughter was allergic to regular cheese), 
quick pizzas made with packaged crusts (this time of year, these are the ideal 
final resting place for the leftover peppers and eggplant you grilled for 
Saturday night's dinner), pastas and one or two dishes such as red beans and 
rice. 
</P>
<P>
 A Creole classic, red beans and rice is, by definition, weekday fare -- in New 
Orleans, it's always served on Mondays. But this is not the authentic red beans 
and rice. Actually, it's more like what I think red beans and rice should taste 
like. With all apologies to Louis Armstrong (who used to sign his autograph 
"Red Beans and Ricely Yours"), I've never had a classic version of red beans 
and rice that I fell in love with. 
</P>
<P>
 In the real dish, red beans are cooked with sausage in a thick sauce that is 
served atop plain boiled rice. But the thick sauce is too heavy and the plain 
rice is too bland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So, in this version, I season the rice with a bit of good smoked sausage 
(along with the Creole trinity of onions, bell peppers and celery) and stir in 
the red beans at the end. What you get is a hearty, warm, smoky dish of rice 
studded with sausage and almost sweet-tasting beans. Best of all, you end up 
with it in less than half an hour. 
</P>
<P>

WINE: THE WINE DOCTOR IS IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beringer Vineyards recently decided to pour a few too-long-in-the-cellar 
bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon for visitors. When some of the 1937 was opened, 
winemaker Ed Sbragia for comparison poured glasses of his 1992 Cabernet, which 
at the time was still in the barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 The older wine had a magnificent mature aroma of cedar, cigar-box and leather. 
But its taste was completely washed out, thin and lackluster. The 1992, by 
contrast, had no bouquet at all -- it was pure fruit, blackberry jam and 
cherries. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with two flawed wines, I did what I could to get something enjoyable: I 
poured one into the other. The blend was intriguing, with the aroma of maturity 
from the 1937 and the taste of fruit from the '92. It wasn't a great wine, but 
it was better than either had been on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 That got me to thinking about what Acacia Winery winemaker Larry Brooks calls 
dinner-table chemistry: the repairing of a wine that, though not "broken," is 
not really enjoyable by itself and needs a bit of help. Think of it as an 
adult's version of playing with your dinner. I do it all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Repairing" can be something as simple as adding ice cubes to a wine that is 
too warm. That's an old and common trick, especially in the back country of 
France and Italy, where red wines need to be cooled and thinned out in summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But there are a number of other tricks: A tart, steely, totally dry Chardonnay 
can get a splash of a slightly sweeter Riesling. Or, for a Chardonnay made too 
sweet, a few drops of grapefruit juice. Sauvignon Blanc that's too sweet can 
benefit from a drop of lime juice. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the simplest things you can do to improve a red wine that is too tannic 
is to add an ounce or so of water. ("I use Evian because it's better than tap 
water," says Brooks.) Water is also excellent to add to a heavy red wine when 
it's hot outside and all you want is a taste of the wine with your food. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Williams of Joseph Phelps Vineyards prefers club soda to water and uses 
it to fix a too-alcoholic white wine. He even says a dash of 7-Up is not 
unthinkable in a Chardonnay that's very tart. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Rinaldi of Duckhorn Vineyards likes to experiment with inexpensive French 
white wines. He says the aromas and tastes are different from what California 
produces, but occasionally these wines are awfully tart, almost sour. In these 
cases, Rinaldi says, he puts in a little NutraSweet -- not enough to actually 
sweeten the wine but just enough to soften the acid. 
</P>
<P>
 Acacia's Brooks observes that the addition of a bit of artificial sweetener is 
also useful in fixing wines that lack fruit. "Equal or some of the other 
sweeteners are flavor potentiators as well as sweeteners," he says. "What 
little flavor is there (in the wine) can be brought out by careful use of 
Equal." 
</P>
<P>
 When winemakers come upon a wine that has a faint sulfurous note, like rotten 
egg, many toss in a penny. The copper reacts with the sulfide to eliminate the 
aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Richmond, president of Acacia, is addicted to tabletop blending. He'll 
blend wines from three or four producers -- even if the wines are made from 
different grape varieties -- to make a wine that is better with the food than 
any one of them would on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Rector, former winemaker at Glen Ellen Vineyards, adds a drop or two of 
Tabasco sauce to Sauvignon Blancs that lack varietal character. "It really 
gives the wine more intensity," he says. "With three drops, you get the heat."  
</P>
<P>
 But adding just two drops to a six-ounce glass makes the wine tell a different 
story. "The slight amount of vinegar in (two drops of) Tabasco will bring the 
nose up out of the glass," Rector says. "You need some volatile acidity, and 
that's what the vinegar is. Then there is the herbal-ness, the chile 
pepper/paprika character, that adds to the character of the wine." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Harvey, winemaker for Renwood Winery in Amador, occasionally finds wine 
too high in volatile acidity -- a vinegar aroma. He suggests splashing the wine 
back and forth between two glasses for a couple of minutes. Because the smell 
is volatile, it may aerate off. If not, pour in a splash of another winery's 
wine of the same type. "You can blend VA down real easy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have a wine that needs added flavor, a new product has hit the 
shelves, though it's in limited supply: verjuice (often spelled the French way, 
verjus ). It is the unfermented juice of tart, unripe grapes. The name is 
French for green juice . Of course, verjuice is new only in this country. It's 
actually a very old ingredient that was used all over medieval Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 When verjuice is combined with a nondescript Italian Pinot Grigio, for 
example, the results can be amazing. The wine takes on a more fleshy, 
full-bodied character, and the flavors are far more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At least two companies are making small amounts of verjuice. The grapes come 
from the thinnings that are typically done six to eight weeks before the 
harvest. The reason for thinning is to remove excess crop from the vines, 
concentrating the flavors of the remaining grapes for winemaking. 
</P>
<P>
 In years past, the thinned fruit would simply be thrown away. Now some 
entrepreneurs are squeezing these grapes and making an intriguing juice out of 
it that is not very sweet and is fairly high in acidity. Since it has not been 
fermented, it contains no alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 The aroma of most verjuice is mildly citrus-y. When used in cooking as a 
substitute for lemon juice, sauces come out tart, but sweeter and more 
delicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Napa Valley Kitchens' verjuice, called "Consorzio" and made from either Muscat 
or Pinot Noir grapes, sells for about $6 a bottle. Both are excellent for 
perking up dull, lifeless wine. For details, call (800) 288-1089. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro Vineyards in Mendocino County, (707) 895-3686, has made a verjuice for 
the last two years. The winery is nearly sold out but has a few half-bottles 
remaining at $4 each. Also, Peter Hall, chef at Stars' Oakville Cafe in 
Oakville, has experimented with verjuice in his cooking and finds it better 
than lemon juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Verjuice -- though fairly lacking in varietal character -- may also be found 
at some Iranian markets under the name ab ghureh . Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Pellegrini Family Vineyards Carignane ($8.50) -- If you drive the back 
roads of northern Sonoma County, you'll see vineyards with small, gnarled old 
vines growing without trellis wires. These vines, many of them planted before 
Prohibition, are not of the chic varieties; they were the grapes Italian 
farmers loved, back when wine was just a beverage, not a snob's paradise. The 
wines they made would always be blends, not varietals. 
</P>
<P>
 Carignane, one such grape, may make more wine than any other in the world. In 
France, where more than half a million acres of it grow, Carignane makes a 
soft, earthy/fruity wine that is tart and light. Carignane is a workhorse 
element in hearty red wine blends, adding flavor and texture without 
coarseness. But rarely is it bottled by itself as a varietal, and never this 
good! 
</P>
<P>
 The Pellegrini family has long had a lot of ancient Carignane vines, and in 
1993 they let their brilliant winemaker Merry Edwards craft this wine with the 
emphasis on fruit. The wine is loaded with ripe cherry fruit and delicate 
spices, with only a hint of the earthiness I've detected in many Carignanes 
treated less carefully. There is oak aging, but the aroma shows only a trace. 
The texture is perfect, dry but not harsh. Edwards also made a 1993 Pellegrini 
Barbera ($9.75) in the same manner. Both are wines to search for.

GRILLING ON THE RIM; SHOPPING FOR SAUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Buying marinades and spices for Asian barbecue can be an overwhelming and 
bewildering experience: There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of 
products on the market. Such profusion began long before there were 
supermarkets and contemporary packaging, however. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with hawkers in open market stalls serving travelers or other people 
who had no cooking facilities. Eventually, lured by the enticing aromas of 
grilling meat, everyone came to patronize the stalls. As competition grew and 
vendors spread to other parts of town, they began to distinguish their wares by 
perfecting their own distinctive marinade flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Street-side barbecue is even now very much a part of urban Asian life. In 
Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines and Japan (where sate is called 
yakitori), vendors still set up their braziers on street corners and in train 
and bus stations. 
</P>
<P>
 But plenty of grilling is done at home too, and in the last decade or so, with 
the arrival of supermarkets in Asia, food manufacturers have come up with all 
sorts of prepared marinades and sauces. There is everything from instant 
Singaporean-style spicy spareribs mix to pear-flavored Korean marinade. 
Competition among most brands is just as fierce as it was between those vendors 
in the old-time markets.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A staggering number of Asian barbecue condiments are imported into the United 
States. American companies -- in addition to American-based branches of Asian 
companies -- are turning out barbecue products. Ebara, a Japanese sauce maker, 
imports about 10 meat marinades and teriyaki-style sauces to sell largely 
through Japanese markets. U.S. Ebara also produces a local line distributed to 
most major supermarkets. "The sauces have slightly different flavor profiles," 
says Michael Frank of Ebara, "and, of course, the labels are all in English."  
</P>
<P>
 Some locally made sauces and marinades such as Noh of Hawaii's Chinese-style 
char siu and Korean-style kalbi are geared to well-established Asian-American 
populations. Others, such as Lawry's Teriyaki Sauce and Tommy Tang's Sate 
Marinade and Sate Sauce, are geared to non-Asian consumers. "People don't use 
our sauces strictly for Thai dishes," says Gary Arabia of Tommy Tang's. "They 
can marinate a whole chicken with the sate marinade or use the peanut-based 
sauce for any kind of salad."  
</P>
<P>
 For those shopping somewhat randomly in Asian and/or mainstream stores, the 
choices can be overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Shun Fat Market, on Atlantic Boulevard in Monterey Park, has one 
of the widest pan-Asian selections in Southern California. Bypassing the 
familiar brands -- Kikkoman Teriyaki Glaze and Dynasty Chinese Barbecue Sauce 
-- in favor of more exotic sauces, Shun Fat offers a vegetarian barbecue sauce 
produced by AGV products of Taiwan, also XO brand and Kimlan brand satay 
pastes, both Taiwanese-produced peanut sauces spiked with chiles, ground dry 
shrimp and garlic. In the same aisle are three brands of Thai sweet-hot chile 
sauce to accompany Thai barbecued chicken. Close to these is Hai Pao Wang brand 
barbecue sauce from Taiwan. Said to be the original authentic style of 
Cantonese barbecue sauce, the paste-like mixture contains dried shrimp and 
fish, garlic, shallots and chile. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Near the Vietnamese soup seasonings -- but before you get to the flour 
mixtures -- are several American-Vietnamese barbecue seasoning products, 
including Golden Bell Brand's Special Barbecue Spices (with directions in 
English) and King Sing's B.B.Q Beef and Shrimp Mix.  
</P>
<P>
 At the Indonesian-Malay section you'll find the nicely packaged Kokita line of 
sauces. These Indonesian imports include bumbu sate , a marinade made primarily 
from shallots, garlic and soy sauce. Its accompaniment, saos sate (satay 
dipping sauce), is a thick, peanut-based mixture spiked with chile. There 
you'll also find Filipino barbecue marinades and seasonings.  
</P>
<P>
 Char siu , the red Chinese barbecued pork, is popular all over Asia, so Shun 
Fat carries brands of char siu seasoning to suit people from many countries. In 
the dry seasonings aisle you'll find Lobo brand powdered char siu seasoning mix 
from Thailand. Sun-Bird brand dry Chinese barbecue seasoning mix made in 
Torrance seems to be preferred by Japanese-Americans, Noh brand char siu 
seasoning by Filipinos and Hawaiians. With the wet sauces is another selection 
of char siu in jars. Especially good is Lee Kum Kee brand, made in Hong Kong.  
</P>
<P>
 At the Hughes market across the street, the selection is also substantial. But 
as you might imagine, there are more American-produced items such as S&W Light 
Teriyaki Sauce, Trader Vic's Chinese-Style Teriyaki Sauce and Rice Road's 
Teriyaki Basting Sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are also plenty of imported Asian brands, especially in the Chinese and 
Japanese food section, including Miyako Brand Teri Sauce, Nippon Meat Packers 
Oriental Style Barbecue Sauce, Yeo's Singapore Spicy Spareribs Marinade Mix 
(for braising or barbecue) and Kimlan Chinese Barbecue Sauce imported from 
Taiwan.  
</P>
<P>
 At Market World in Koreatown, most barbecue marinades (aside from the Kraft 
Thick and Spicy and Marie Callender's Bold) are imported from Korea. Although 
the ingredients are listed in English, most have directions in Hangul. Hence 
they can be a bit of a gamble. The bulkogi marinade imported by Seoul Shik Poom 
Inc., which lists pear as an ingredient, has a complex and fruity flavor. Some 
other brands taste like a straight mixture of soy sauce and sugar.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ralphs market at Vermont Avenue and 3rd Street in Los Angeles has -- in 
addition to a mainstream barbecue sauce section that offers Janet's Original 
Jerk Marinade Sauce and Stubbs Legendary Moppin' Sauce from Austin Texas -- an 
international aisle with dozens of domestic and imported Asian seasonings and 
sauces. The teriyaki sauces alone include brands by Diamond of Honolulu Rice 
Road, Ebara, Sun-Bird, Kikkoman, Aloha Chef, Kona Coast, Noh of Hawaii, Nippon 
Meat Packers of Osaka and several others. They also stock Kona Coast Sweet and 
Sour Barbecue Sauce and Lobo Brand char siu seasoning from Thailand among their 
many non-teriyaki Asian barbecue products.  
</P>
<P>
 At Kawa and Naga, two nearby Filipino markets, sauces are also fairly 
international. Look for Mama's Best and Mama Sita's barbecue marinade and 
seasonings in bottles and dry mixes. These imports are for Filipino-style sate 
babi . Adopted from Indonesia, sate is as familiar to any Filipino as pizza is 
to an American. Dry marinades are rubbed directly into thinly sliced beef 
before it is grilled or baked. Instructions on all of these products suggest 
trying them on chicken too. Mama Sita's also makes a marinade for tocino , the 
Filipino-style "bacon."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Little Tokyo West on Sawtelle Boulevard, Safe & Save market has the most 
diverse selection, including small square bottles of kabayaki no tare for 
barbecued eel. At Nijiya market, the Angelo Piero marinade and salad dressing, 
an East-West style product imported from Japan, comes in ume (plum), miso and 
original flavors.  
</P>
<P>
 Both stores carry Ohgon no Aji Tare , Ebara's imported up-market marinade. 
This is a delicious blend of soy sauce, fruit juices, wine and other seasonings 
that comes in mild, medium, hot and Korean style.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: ISLAND CONTINENTAL

 Ramayani is the poshest Indonesian place in town, a new restaurant next to the 
dry cleaners in a new, weirdly cosmopolitan mall wrapped around a high-rise 
tourist hotel near the TV studios in Hollywood. If you've spent much time in 
L.Al's spartan Indonesian restaurants, all Formica and batik, this sister of an 
unspectacular Westwood cafe might be a little bit astonishing: mirrors 
everywhere, marble floors in the bathroom and long display cases of 
duty-free-shop-style luxury goods that give the place the feel of a first-class 
lounge at some East Asian airport. 
</P>
<P>
 A large-screen TV set seems always to be blasting Oprah or something in the 
afternoons, except when it's playing karaoke videodiscs of "Feelings." The 
first time I came in, the waiters were taking turns crooning Paul Anka tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the best Indonesian restaurants in town tend to specialize in the 
cooking of a specific region, Ramayani serves something like an Indonesian 
equivalent of the Continental cuisine of those joints that used to serve both 
crepes Suzette and veal piccata. The restaurant's impossibly large menu 
features things from all over the Indonesian archipelago -- the sweet, thickly 
sauced food of Java; the complexly spiced stews of Bali; the impossibly hot 
Padang-style cooking of Western Sumatra -- along with the sates, fried noodles 
with chicken and peanut-sauced salads that seem common to all Indonesian 
kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the best dishes here are the simplest stir-fries: Chinese watercress 
fried with garlic; squid fried with red chile and a pungent dose of fermented 
shrimp paste; shrimp tossed with chile and a generous handful of pete , the 
notorious stinky bean of Indonesian cooking. The plain fried game hen with 
garlic seems to be about 95% crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 To start, there are rempeyek kacang , lacy Javanese fritters, almost cookies, 
spiced with coriander and as spiked with peanuts as peanut brittle; corn 
fritters that would be at home on a Southern table; the crisp, egg-filled 
pastry called martabak that is a little like an East Indies version of the 
Moroccan bestila . 
</P>
<P>
 Otak-otak are bland little cylinders of fish-cake baked in banana leaves. 
Indonesian fried won ton seem identical to the usual Cantonese takeout won ton, 
right down to the pleasing oiliness and the little dish of sweet and sour 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Gulai kambing , a fine version of the traditional West Sumatran holiday dish, 
is a spice-fragrant, brothy lamb stew, almost fire-engine red, enough to flavor 
an entire plate of rice -- the dish could be the Indonesian mole. Daging sapi 
bumbu Bali involves slices of rather overcooked steak stewed in a chile-red 
Balinese spice mixture seasoned with tamarind. 
</P>
<P>
 What you want to go for is nasi gudek , a combination plate that is the most 
famous dish of Jogjakarta but is served nowhere else in Los Angeles. It 
revolves around a stew of chicken and green jackfruit, a seething yellow mass 
rich with coconut milk, barely sweet and faintly tart, with a round aftertaste 
of fruit. It is served with a bed of rice seasoned with frizzles of browned 
onion, garnished with a deep-fried egg and crunchy batons of plantain, and 
includes a couple of pieces of chicken in mild yellow curry. It is difficult to 
believe there might be quite so much pleasure in what is Ramayani's version of 
the No. 2 dinner at El Coyote. 
</P>

IF IT'S THURSDAY, THIS MUST BE POSOLE

 It's Thursday afternoon in the palm-cloaked town of Zihuatanejo on Mexico's 
west coast. The doctor's office is dark. Construction sites lie idle. The 
hotels are staffed with skeleton crews. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't just another siesta hour. Here, and in other Mexican towns dotting 
the coast, Thursday is posole day. By 2 p.m., tourists may still be at the 
beach, but locals are on their way to a serious feast that -- between eating, 
socializing and simply digesting -- will likely consume the remainder of their 
work day. 
</P>
<P>
 Posole , a dense, gelatinous stew of hominy and, typically, pork head, meat 
and bones, is eaten in many parts of Mexico. You'll find a simple white version 
at cantinas in Guadalajara and a shrimp-based variety in mountain towns along 
Jalisco's Ameca River. In Mexico City, overzealous revelers swear by posole as 
a sure-fire hangover cure. 
</P>
<P>
 But along the Pacific Coast, this gutsy concoction is the center of a 
time-honored Thursday ritual. On that day, humble posolerias , shuttered most 
of the week, come to life. Rickety tables are perked up with checked oilcloths, 
and kitchens emit the mouthwatering aroma of simmering meat and piquant spices. 
By mid-morning, local workers are busy debating which posoleria they'll visit 
-- a subject not taken lightly, since everyone seems to have a favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Zihuatanejo, Teozintle is one of the town's best-loved posole haunts. With 
only a small sign dangling out front, this utterly unassuming building on the 
busy airport road is easy for out-of-towners to miss. But locals have no 
problem. By 3 o'clock, VW Beetles, shiny sedans and dented pick-up trucks have 
filled the parking lot and spill out onto the road.  
</P>
<P>
 Shaded by a sloping red tile roof, the packed outdoor dining terrace offers a 
human profile of the town. At one table sit 10 Westin resort bellmen in 
starched white uniforms; another table seats five Sheraton receptionists in 
vivid floral prints. Nearby, 10 government officials pow-wow in open-necked 
dress shirts, and a doctor chats quietly with his nurse, wife and child. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Arturo Meneses keeps a small stack of hand-lettered menus around, but 
regulars rarely request them. Their only dilemma is whether to order mild white 
posole or the lusty green variety (popular in the state of Guerrero) that is 
laced with toasted pumpkin seeds, epazote and fragrant hoja santa. (The 
neighboring state of Michoacan typically serves a red posole , spiked with 
guajillo chiles.) The intrepid, or simply indecisive, can visit the kitchen, 
where Arturo's wife, Rosalva, offers tastes from huge caldrons brimming with 
pig snouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Once this decision is made, the ritual begins. Waiters carry fried pork rinds, 
crisp tortilla triangles and posole platters laden with shredded lettuce, 
chopped onions, red radishes, diced avocados, crumbled white cheese and sliced 
limes to tables littered with cigarette packs and tequila glasses. Aficionados 
round all this out with plates of pickled pig's feet. 
</P>
<P>
 When the posole arrives, chatter dies down and diners turn their attention to 
the deep ceramic bowls before them. To the steaming broth, thick with morsels 
of pork and chewy kernels of perfectly blossomed hominy, they add some or most 
of the garnishes from the central platter. Then they get down to business. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 In the intense afternoon heat, beads of sweat form on foreheads, trickle down 
faces. Every few minutes customers pause to smoke a cigarette, mop their brows. 
Posole is a workout, often leaving green-horns feeling they've been physically 
pummeled. But when that soft breeze hits one's moist skin and icy beer braces 
one's tingling palate, this Mexican foil to midday heat puts dainty salads and 
air conditioning to shame. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, posole is made with hominy -- a large kerneled corn treated 
with limestone and dried. To obtain a lively flower-like bloom, Mexican cooks 
usually remove the tiny hull from each kernel by hand before boiling for hours. 
In the interest of time and accessibility, we have substituted canned hominy in 
the following posole recipes. Additionally, most pork-based posoles rely on pig 
heads and feet for their hearty, gelatinous body. We suggest American cooks use 
stew bones and pig's feet. If using feet does not suit you, feel free to omit 
them -- the result will still be quite delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Do be sure to present a generous garnish platter alongside the posole -- it 
makes all the difference.

 Carrots, spinach, peas and beans add color and substance to this low-fat 
version of fried rice, which has only 3 grams of fat per serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Egg substitute is stirred into the rice at the end of stir frying for body. An 
omelet is made from the remaining egg substitute that is then cut into strips 
and lightly stirred in just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that cooked rice should be cold for stir-frying, so it doesn't get a 
"gummy" texture. It is fried in a wok sprayed with sesame-flavored cooking 
spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a small amount of soy sauce is stirred into the rice. Additional soy 
sauce may be served on the side. A garnish of shredded red cabbage adds a nice 
touch of color. SHRIMP FRIED RICE

pieces. Set aside. Grill shrimp until opaque and cooked through, 3 to 4 
minutes. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Spray wok with Oriental-flavor nonstick cooking spray. Stir-fry garlic and 
carrot 1 to 2 minutes. Add rice and continue to stir-fry 4 to 5 minutes until 
hot. Stir in soy sauce. Make well in center and add 1/2 cup of egg substitute. 
Cook until bottom is set. Stir to break up eggs. Then stir into rice.

 It was wonderful reading about all the "old" restaurants in Los Angeles circa 
1940-1960 ("In Celebration of Restaurants Past," Sept. 29). They brought back 
lovely memories of special dining during my "salad days." 
</P>
<P>
 However, I precede Ms. Dosti and Mr. Andrews by some years, and grew up in 
Long Beach in the 1930s. On Sunday afternoons, my mother, father and I would 
sedately motor on surface streets in an always-gray Oldsmobile or Buick to dine 
out in downtown Los Angeles. Who can forget all the charming places like: Pig 
'n' Whistle; Carolina Pines; Lucas; Goodfellow's Grotto; Dinty Moore's; Victor 
Hugo; Bit of Sweden; the original Lawry's; the Baltimore Hotel, and so many 
others? 
</P>
<P>
 For more memories even before that era, do read M.F.K. Fisher's "To Begin 
Again," a sweet reminiscence of her youth in the 1920s.

 Thanks for your great section on restaurants of L.A. past. As a child, I too 
was taken to many of the places mentioned and several other favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Brown Derby, my favorite meal was a plate of mini-hamburgers topped 
with various sauces, with plenty of pumpernickel toast for starters. My 
favorite meal of all was eggs Benedict and fresh raspberries with cream in the 
garden room of the Polo Lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sunday school with Jimmy Stewart's children at Beverly Hills 
Presbyterian, we always repaired to Linny's Deli, the deli of choice in the 
dark ages before Nate 'n' Al's. 
</P>
<P>
 For my birthday, I usually wanted to go to the Luau and throw money in the 
lagoon. After downing a copious selection of fried appetizers covered in duck 
sauce, my father always joked that we didn't need to order anything else, but 
of course we always did.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s my boyfriend, no doubt seeking to corrupt an innocent 
16-year-old, introduced me to Nanki-Poo's on La Cienega. It was a "waterfall 
Chinese" place, as Jonathan Gold says, but its main attribute was its 
willingness to serve multiple daiquiris to teens out for a night on the town. 
</P>
<P>
 Another favorite spot was Chez Puce, a quirky creperie in a ramshackle part of 
Pico Boulevard (across from Santa Monica High). I seem to recall Madame Puce 
boisterously presiding over the kitchen, a generally raucous atmosphere, and a 
huge pan of free brownies at the door. Puce's crepes were enormously doughy 
things stuffed with garlic butter or ratatouille. Madame surfaced briefly at 
the Mayfair Music hall when it was still open, but where is she now?

 I was quite disappointed to find no caption for the photo running in the 
Counter Intelligence column (Sept. 29). The gentleman on the right is more than 
likely the Maitre d', and unless I miss my guess, the man speaking to the 
waitress is Jack Dempsey. If not, who? And what is the restaurant? 
</P>
<P>
 My chagrin deepened as I read Jonathan Gold's pathetic work. I'm curious about 
his age. His closing paragraph really did me in. He thinks of Oki Dog punkers 
throwing burritos at passing cars? My God! That certainly puts to the lie the 
heading of his column: "Counter Intelligence." My aunt's fanny! 
</P>
<P>
 When my bride (of 41 years) and I think of "old Hollywood restaurants," our 
first and second thoughts are of Ciro's, where the food complemented the 
entertainment and vice versa. I'd like Mr. Gold to imagine dining on a filet 
mignon charbroiled to perfection while delighting in Rosemarie ("Gee, I'm Glad 
I'm Not a Cigarette Butt") opening for Lily St. Cyr in her marvelously 
erogenous (sic) bathtub scene! 
</P>
<P>
 Our third choice would be the Mocambo, for dinner and dancing, then next door 
to the Interlude Room for drinks (Shirley Temples) and entertainment 
fantastique. One late evening there, stand-up singer, comedian, bon vivant , 
Lord Byron, replete with white silk ascot and tailed coat, romanced my 
bride-to-be in a most Chaucerian manner, whisked her onto his stage (the dance 
floor) and twirled her to the music of the combo on duty. And, oh, could she 
dance! She was absolutely thrilled, and I was as proud as a young peacock! 
</P>
<P>
 Now that was Hollywood!

 These days, people are satisfied cooking much more simply. They no longer feel 
they must try to re-create restaurant dishes for their guests.  
</P>
<P>
 That's the good news. The bad news is we're still stuck with making hors 
d'oeuvres. You do need something light to nibble on with drinks before dinner. 
Something light -- heavy hors d'oeuvres can throw a meal off kilter. 
</P>
<P>
 Things like cured olives, raw vegetables served with a full-flavored dip and 
fresh salted nuts are easy options. You might also consider the following 
suggestions, which are easily prepared and will tempt guests without 
interfering with their appetites -- all at under five grams of fat per serving. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 You can reduce the fat content in these spiced nuts by combining a little oil 
with egg whites, which also makes them very crisp. Be sure to taste a nut 
before making the recipe; make sure they are not rancid or stale-tasting. You 
can substitute an equal quantity of walnuts if you want.

 Delicious plain, these potato skins are even better sprinkled with grated 
imported Parmesan cheese. I tested this recipe with baking potatoes and small 
red potatoes; the latter have a more appealing texture.  
</P>
<P>
 CRISP GARLIC POTATO SKINS 
</P>
<P>
 6 medium red potatoes, scrubbed 
</P>
<P>
 1 egg white

 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons shredded imported Parmesan cheese 
</P>

 Bake potatoes on baking sheet on center oven rack at 450 degrees until tender, 
about 40 minutes. Cool until easy to handle. Can be baked 1 day ahead and 
refrigerated after completely cooled. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out center with small melon baller, 
leaving 1/8-inch thick shell. (Use reserved scooped potato in soups or fried 
potatoes.)  
</P>
<P>
 Whisk together egg white, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper in small bowl 
until very frothy. Brush inside of skins with mixture. Place in single layer on 
baking sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 450 degrees until crisp and only lightly browned, about 20 to 25 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightly brush skins with mixture again. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, 
pressing lightly into place with back of spoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake until cheese is melted and skins are deeply browned on edges. Serve hot. 
Makes about 4 servings.

BACK TO BASICS: BREAK AN EGG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nice thing about learning to make an omelet is that even if at first you 
don't succeed, all isn't lost. The results may not be omelets, but they will be 
very acceptable scrambled eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be that making omelets required a special pan used only for that 
purpose. Those traditional French-style omlet pans, made of spun steel, are 
still around, but you can also use any of the small (6-, 7- or 8-inch 
diameter), heavy-gauge nonstick skillets with sloping sides. Most of these pans 
have long handles, which makes the process easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin by breaking three eggs into a small bowl. Blend the whites and yolks 
well with a fork (Step 1), but the mixture should not be foamy. Some recipes 
call for a tablespoon of milk per egg or a little water, and most people add a 
little salt and pepper for flavor. Others claim the seasoning should be added 
after cooking, that salt toughens the eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat about one tablespoon of butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. As 
it begins to melt, tilt the pan to thoroughly coat the bottom and sides (Step 
2). Then, just as the butter begins to sizzle and turns brown, add the beaten 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the classic method, one hand rapidly slides the skillet back and forth over 
the heat source while the other hand stirs the eggs over the bottom of the 
skillet with a fork as they thicken. What's important is that the cooked egg 
gets moved gently aside to allow the uncooked egg to run into the bottom of the 
pan. What's easiest for most people is to lift the edge of the cooked eggs with 
a narrow spatula and tip the pan to allow the uncooked portion of the eggs to 
flow underneath (Step 3). 
</P>
<P>
 When the bottom of the omelet has set but the top is still moist and creamy, 
add the desired filling down the center (Step 4). Lift the edge and check that 
the bottom of the omelet is golden brown, then use a spatula to fold the omelet 
in half or thirds (Step 5) and slide out of the pan onto a serving plate (Step 
6). FILLING SUGGESTIONS: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cheese -- Shred 1/2 cup Cheddar, Jack, Swiss or a combination. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mushroom -- Saute 3 to 4 sliced mushrooms in small amount of butter. Season 
to taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Western -- Saute 1/4 cup chopped ham, 1 tablespoon chopped onion, 1 
tablespoon chopped green pepper and 1 tablespoon sliced celery in small amount 
of butter or margarine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 * Strawberries and Sour Cream -- Slice strawberries equal to 1/2 cup. Sweeten 
lightly with sugar. Use half as filling, then garnish omelet with remaining 
strawberries and dollop of sour cream.

JOHN O' GROATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read your Sept. 22 article by Jonathan Gold in praise of the outstanding 
Westside restaurant John O' Groats with great interest, having enjoyed many of 
its excellent vegetarian dishes myself. Therefore, it was most surprising to 
find a typical Sikh diner so inaccurately described as a "hamburger-ordering 
Sikh." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Sikh community is highly visible and recognizable, because we 
usually dress in white, and both men and women wear turbans. For more than 25 
years many of us in Los Angeles have frequented Westside restaurants, and it is 
generally known and respected that we are vegetarians. Paul Tyler, whose family 
owns John O' Groats and who himself spends much of his time there, told me he 
had never seen a Sikh order a hamburger and that he too was surprised at Gold's 
use of the words hamburger-ordering to describe a Sikh. (Veggie-burger, maybe, 
but hamburger ? I don't think so!)

 Jeff and Jeannie Reese and his wife were honeymooning in England when they 
fell in love . . . with gingerbread. One bite of the rich, spicy cake and they 
were hooked. Back home in California, the newlyweds searched everywhere for it. 
No one made the kind of gingerbread they loved. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how things get started," says Jeff Reese, a former computer graphics 
designer. "You look for it. You don't find it. You do it yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Using friends and relatives as guinea pigs, the couple experimented with a lot 
of recipes. "We gave everyone gingerbread cookies for Christmas, and most 
everyone survived," Reese says. In 1991, finally satisfied with the formula, 
the couple rented space in a small bakery. Keeping their day jobs, the Reeses 
made gingerbread in their off hours and sold it under the J & J Gourmet 
Gingerbread label Sunday mornings at the Hollywood farmers market. Their 
customers gave them plenty of feedback on everything from the taste to the 
packaging. "It was market research to the n th degree," says Reese. "We needed 
to find out we weren't alone in our admiration for the gingerbread." 
</P>
<P>
 The company now makes four types of ginger cookies: a dark, soft type with 
pecans; spicy biscotti; crunchy dunkers; and a soft, fat-free version. A 
gingerbread loaf is also available during the holidays. Besides the Hollywood 
farmers market, the Reeses' products are sold at three other local growers' 
markets: Ventura on Saturday mornings; Santa Clarita on Sunday mornings, and 
Thousand Oaks on Thursday afternoons. The cookies are reasonably priced -- $3 
for an eight-ounce bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, who now devotes all his time to the gingerbread business, is 
concentrating on mail order (minimum mail order is five bags). He is working on 
getting MasterCard and Visa. "It's been a tremendous learning experience," he 
says. "Had we not been so naive, we probably would not have started the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 He also knows that making a tasty product is not enough these days. That's why 
he's not putting all his eggs in one basket. Says Reese: "I still buy my Lotto 
tickets."

CIVIC ARTS PLAZA; STRUCTURE BUILDS ON DISCREET DIVERSITY; THE MULTIFACETED 
ARCHITECTURE REFLECTS THE COMPLEX'S USES AS GOVERNMENT CENTER, PUBLIC MEETING 
PLACE AND THEATRICAL VENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The gradual unfolding of architect Antoine Predock's grand Civic Arts Plaza in 
Thousand Oaks has been an unusually public process. Butting up against the 
Ventura Freeway as it does, the project has been a highly visible 
work-in-progress over the past several months, even more so than Richard 
Meier's Getty Center hilltop citadel along the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 We who haunt the Ventura Freeway have watched the leviathan plaza grow 
dramatically, from its skeletal stage through the completion of its mammoth 
cube. From the freeway perspective, it looked as if International style's 
geometry was married to Pueblo style earthiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the peculiar adornments on the cube's exterior: On the west-facing 
wall there appeared the buckshot-and-cork "pictograph wall," with its images 
created from perforations in the surface; a large, diagonally placed 
ladder-like relief sculpture; the thin serpentine windows cut into the thick 
facade. Later came the copper curtain on the opposite wall, a poetic solution 
to the problem of identifying the structure's theatrical nature. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza, which is officially launched this month, is a fine 
example of architectural problem-solving and artistic evolution. Unfortunately, 
what you see from the freeway is not what Thousand Oaks gets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the way Predock has designed the complex to embrace the sloping site, the 
positioning of the main theater's massive cube creates a bulwark against the 
freeway. From the proper low angle, sight lines lead the eye up and over the 
freeway, connecting the hillside with the other side, as it once was. 
</P>
<P>
 From down below on Thousand Oaks Avenue -- the plaza's most flattering vantage 
point -- the structure reveals itself more fully. A combination of government 
center, public meeting place and arts complex, it has been described as five 
buildings "pretending to be one." 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lay Predock's challenge, and also the spur to his creative triumph. 
Because of its multiple-use function, as a home for city government and arts -- 
from high, low and middling cultural bases -- an intricate and multifaceted 
architectural program seems logical. 
</P>
<P>
 Aptly, Predock's cultural/civic complex isn't nearly as monolithic or 
monochromatic as a cursory glance seems to reveal. Discreet diversity exists, 
from the variety of geometric forms -- rectilinear volumes to a quasi-Mayan 
pyramid -- to the exterior materials used. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfaces range from the utilitarian, reinforced concrete parking structure to 
the beige, sandstone-like surface of the theater to contrasting stone brick 
exteriors. Throughout, Predock sets up a graceful discontinuity between the 
elements involved. 
</P>
<P>
 All along, the not-so-silent partner has been the freeway -- that omniscient 
force in Southern California life and the very reason that cities such as 
Thousand Oaks exist. You can try to design around it, and find clever ways to 
accommodate it, but still you get that steady hum and whoosh. 
</P>
<P>
 But, once inside the Civic Arts Plaza, the visitor gets the impression of a 
self-contained village that acts as a civilized refuge. By that basic standard, 
the place succeeds: It invites us in and asks that we linger. 
</P>
<P>
 While architects are often granted a longer expressive leash and are able to 
explore more radical ideas in urban centers and other rare circumstances, 
moderation is often required in outlying areas. Michael Graves' ITP building 
unveiled at UC Santa Barbara last spring, a subtle variation on the omnipresent 
Spanish Colonial theme, is among his tamest and least-outlandish designs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza, on the other hand, yields to no dominating architectural 
vocabulary, and disguises its risk-taking tendencies behind a deceptive 
simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more inspired architects to have emerged in the stormy era during 
and after post-Modernism and Deconstructionism, Predock is a maverick with a 
cause. With offices in Albuquerque and Venice, the increasingly renowned 
architect tends to marshal a healthy degree of poetry along with the required 
pragmatism. 
</P>
<P>
 He trumpets no particular doctrine other than to follow his own impulses. And, 
in the case of the Civic Arts Plaza, his impulses have cohered into a piece of 
architecture that ennobles the region that plays host to it. 
</P>
<P>
 From below, the structure rises and spreads its limbs proudly, like a model 
city laid out on a hillside, suggesting a design that sits comfortably between 
the primitive and the futuristic. It's far too early to tell, but the subtlety 
of Predock's vision in Thousand Oaks seems to have a safeguard against the 
ravages of time and fashion.

THEATER REVIEW; 'WEREWOLF' A TRUE TREAT FOR HALLOWEEN SEASON; IT'S AN AMALGAM 
OF 1950 HORROR FILMS, 'GREASE' AND 'THE NUTTY PROFESSOR.' STAY FOR THE 
POST-SHOW 'VAUDEVILLE' REVUE.

 The title of the Moorpark Melodrama's current "You Ain't Nothin' But a 
Werewolf" says it all: an amalgam of '50s horror films, "Grease," and a nod to 
"The Nutty Professor." With a couple of standout performances, the show -- 
written by frequent Melodrama contributor Tim Kelly -- is a good bet for those 
intrigued by the premise and in the mood for some Halloween-season fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert Lydecker (Kevin McDonald) is tired of being a misfit at Riverdale High 
School, but probably didn't bargain on stumbling into the laboratory of a mad 
scientist (Will Shupe II) and being transformed into a werewolf. Which is 
exactly what happens. He returns to school where -- instead of terrifying his 
fellow students -- the newly hirsute Rupert becomes very popular, especially 
with the ladies. Which causes no end of consternation to school tough-guy and 
aspiring rock 'n' roll star Chet Lumpcrass (Joseph Pisani). 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a subplot in which an android, aided and abetted by the 
scientist, infiltrates Riverdale High (not the same school that Archie, 
Veronica, Betty and Jughead attended, evidently). That piece of the story goes 
nowhere in particular, but gives Deborah Webster an opportunity to change 
costumes, so what the hey? 
</P>
<P>
 The performers are, as usual for the Melodrama, bright and attractive 
throughout, with especially good work here by Shupe as Dr. Murdock Dangerfield 
and Hiram Johnson as the Werewolf (no, Rupert doesn't change costumes and 
makeup). Director Kevin Karn and choreographer Jeanette Stark keep things 
moving, and the music is a hummable selection of rock 'n' roll oldies. 
</P>
<P>
 The post-show "vaudeville," incidentally, this time is a revue of 
Halloween-oriented songs, many of them from Broadway or environs -- the dentist 
number from "Little Shop of Horrors," the wolf's song from "Into the Woods," 
and so on. It's worth sticking around the extra half an hour. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "You Ain't Nothin' but a Werewolf" 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Thursdays at 7 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. Matinees

</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Magnificent Moorpark Melodrama & Vaudeville Company Theater, 45 E. 
High St., in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>

evening, all seats $12; Saturday and Sunday matinees, $12 adults; $9.50 seniors 
and children. Group rates are available for some performances. Visa and 
MasterCard accepted.

THEATER REVIEW; GRIM REAPER VISITS THOUSAND OAKS STAGE; DESPITE PROBLEMS, 
'DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY' STILL MANAGES TO HOLD UP RATHER WELL AND PROVIDES 
AMUSING ENTERTAINMENT.

<P>
 The Grim Reaper literally takes three days off in "Death Takes a Holiday," a 
comic allegory adapted for the screen in 1934 after a long Broadway run. A 
stage production is now playing at the Arts Council Center in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to understand why people fear him, Death takes human form and visits 
Duke Lambert's castle, where several guests have already gathered. Death 
mingles with the crowd after telling the Duke that revealing his identity will 
lead to severe consequences. The group includes washed-up royalty, a couple of 
old soldiers, the Duke's family and his son's best friend. Death becomes quite 
a pleasant fellow, once he has traded his black robe and skull mask for a 
tuxedo and medallion that make him look like the sommelier in a cheesy 
Hungarian restaurant. And while quizzing the guests he becomes more human 
himself, eventually falling in love. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear from the beginning that the Duke is hardly a man to trust with a 
secret, so suspense comes as the audience waits for him to break down and tell 
everybody that Death walks among them disguised as a Russian diplomat, a 
careless revelation that could lead to the elimination of several future 
generations of Eurotrash. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is essentially a drawing-room comedy, a style that seems to thwart 
modern actors: it's hard to be simultaneously bubbly and jaded -- not to 
mention literate -- in that Noel Coward-Nick and Nora Charles kind of way. The 
current company makes a game try at it under Bianca Jansen's direction, for the 
most part keeping the mood and the mystery up. 
</P>
<P>
 There's lots that's wrong with the play, which was adapted by Walter Ferris 
from the Italian original by Alberto Castella. Characters come and go with no 
reason (several are inexplicably missing at the big showdown), a couple are 
given virtually nothing to do, and you know that something's wrong when Death 
is the most sympathetic character in the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Death is portrayed by Michael Jordan, a rare leading role from a man who 
usually directs but occasionally takes high-profile cameo roles in plays 
directed by himself and others. Sergio Bertolli is Duke Lambert, married to 
Carol Arias as Duchess Stephanie, and father to Corrado (Don Fehmel). The 
guests include the Princess of San Luca (Maggie White, who you know is a 
princess because she wears her jeweled tiara around the castle), and her gloomy 
daughter, Grazia (Jennifer Marie Lester), who in a more contemporary play would 
be dressed in black and remain locked in her room playing her Morrissey or Nine 
Inch Nails albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Other guests include Corrado's friends Eric (Keith Cable) and Rhoda Fenton 
(Judi Berry), socialite Alda (Suzanne McNabb-Tobin), and retired soldiers Baron 
Cesarea (Al Siffer) and Major Whitread (Max Hirschman) of the Foreign Legion. 
The castle is staffed by butler Fedele (Christopher R. Blair) and maid Cora 
(Melissa S. Aries), who are among the missing at showdown time. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding up rather well, considering its age, "Death Takes a Holiday" is 
amusing entertainment, appropriate for teen-agers and older adults, especially 
at Halloween time. Details

NIGHT LIFE: WAR'S ENDURING MESSAGE OF PEACE; THE VETERAN BAND, WITH A LONG 
RECORD OF HITS, IS BRINGING ITS UPBEAT SONGS TO SANTA PAULA FOR A BENEFIT 
PERFORMANCE. 
</P>

<P>
 This War has lasted longer than most others except perhaps the Punic War, the 
Hundred Years War and the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-man squad that is the band War will be bringing its eclectic 
jam-oriented rock, R&B, soul and salsa songs of brotherhood to the Santa Paula 
High School football field Sunday evening for a benefit for Santa Paula Youth 
in Action, a community nonprofit group working to eradicate gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also plays Saturday at Underground in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 War, which just released its 18th album, "Peace Sign," is a band that formed 
in the 1960s in the mean streets of L.A., where war was and is hell. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days they were called Night Shift and played R&B music and backed 
artists such as Marvin Gaye and Little Willie John. Later, they hooked up with 
ex-Animal front-man Eric Burdon and had a hit with "Spill the Wine." After 
Burdon departed, the band had hits with "The Cisco Kid," "Low Rider," "The 
World Is A Ghetto" and "Why Can't We Be Friends?" 
</P>
<P>
 By the early '80s, War had sold more than 20 million albums, but disco and 
techno began to steal their firepower. It was rap music in the '90s that was 
instrumental in bringing them back. Original member and keyboard player Lonnie 
Jordan recently told some War stories. 
</P>
<P>
 How's the new one doing? 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace Sign" is doing real well, but whether there's a record out or not, we 
just play. We've never really left the road -- we've been at this for 30 years. 
We've learned to eat the right food, get enough sleep and stay away from 
alcohol and drugs and communicate with each other. "Peace Sign" is just an 
extension of "The World's A Ghetto" and "Why Can't We Be Friends?" 
</P>
<P>
 How did you guys hook up with Eric Burdon? 
</P>
<P>
 We were playing at the FM Station in the Valley. We were Deacon Jones' back-up 
band -- he wanted to follow in the footsteps of Rosie Grier. Anyway, some 
friends of our bass player, Peter Rosen, brought some friends of friends, one 
of whom was Eric Burdon. He sat in with us and we became his back-up band. He 
stayed with us for three albums and three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
 You guys played at the last Hendrix gig? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it was at a place in London. Jimi was a good friend of Eric's, but we 
were from Compton, and as Night Shift, we used to play nightclubs and do 
jukebox songs by people like James Brown, Solomon Burke, Otis Redding and Bobby 
(Blue) Bland. We started touring a lot with Eric and playing with a lot of 
bands, but most of them I didn't know. There was this British Invasion, but all 
I knew was the Beatles and the Stones. Eric schooled us, enlightened us and we 
realized we were already a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 War is a negative name, but the music always has a positive message. 
</P>
<P>
 War was just a gimmick to get people to come and check us out and find out 
about this War against war on the streets and about war in the rest of the 
world. While we were still Night Shift, one night our manager looked at us and 
said, "You guys look like you just came from a battlefield, from a war." That 
was it, right there. At that time in 1969, there was a war in Vietnam and a war 
in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 People used to fight, now they drive by and shoot everyone and slash your 
tires. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, it's crazy out there, man. When we play, those gangbangers are there 
throwing all those hand signs. But we just throw them a peace sign -- it came 
before they did. We try to get people to get together and be one and forget 
what they do in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 You guys had an unusual way of dealing with the rap samplers. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, before the sampling really got popular, some other artists 
wanted to take these rappers to court to get some money. But we thought if we 
went to court, all the kids would end up hating us and would never buy our 
records. So instead of fighting, we reversed the situation, and put out a War 
album from the samplers, "Rap Declares War." That way, we connected the rappers 
to our generation, and sometimes, they came out and played with us. That way we 
all became friends, and introduced more people to our music. Some of the 
profits go back into the neighborhoods where the rappers now are, and where we 
used to be, instead of just making money like it was some sort of drug deal. 
Without rap, most of the kids today wouldn't know who we were and the group 
would still be dead. Details

CENTERPIECE: TAKING STOCK; CHANNEL ISLANDS PROJECT HELPS TRAIN SCIENTISTS TO 
INVENTORY FLORA AND FAUNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a summer spent either on the water or in the water around the Channel 
Islands National Park, marine biologist Dan Richards and the crew of the 
Pacific Ranger were looking forward to one thing when they finished their work: 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking forward to a long hot shower after taking ship showers all 
week. The stall is really tiny. It'll be nice to take a shower where you can 
move around a little." 
</P>
<P>
 That cruise marked the end of the summer-long project to monitor the kelp 
forest in the park. At several intervals during the season, National Park 
Service scientists and volunteers dove into pre-established study areas around 
the islands to count kelp, tally tunicates and add up abalone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a gorgeous diversity of plants and animals in the kelp forest," 
Richards said. As many as 1,000 species, give or take a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet more than 200 years after Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus developed the 
modern system of classifying plant and animal species, park service scientists 
don't have a method for taking inventory of the flora and fauna in America's 
most treasured natural places. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago a researcher reported that the striped skunk had vanished from 
Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks. The animal was just one of many that 
had apparently become extinct in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 But the finding, based on visitor sightings, was erroneous. It turned out that 
no one bothered to report skunks because they're so common. This drove home the 
point that the park service really had no idea what it had and what it didn't 
have. 
</P>
<P>
 "The researcher mistook the absence of evidence as evidence of absence," said 
David Graber, a biologist at Sequoia and Kings Canyon. "The researcher was 
relying on National Park Service databases that frankly stank." 
</P>
<P>
 The Channel Islands kelp forest monitoring project is a small part of the 
solution. Researchers here and at four national parks have developed models to 
take inventory and monitor a variety of ecosystems so that scientists in green 
denim will be able to give the 250 parks in the national system an annual 
checkup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been at it for 15 years," said Gary Davis, a marine biologist 
responsible for the design of the Channel Island project. "We're just getting 
started." 
</P>
<P>
 But Davis is far enough along to start training managers from other parks on 
how to take stock of the natural resources within their boundaries. The 30 Park 
Service scientists from around the country made a late summer visit to Anacapa 
Island, one of the five islands comprising the park, to participate in a 
tutorial on the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 They watched intently as marine biologist Richards used a submersible camera 
and special diving mask to narrate live pictures of three scientists counting 
and measuring plants and animals in Anacapa's Landing Cove. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Allen, an ecologist at the Park Service's western regional office, was 
enthusiastic about the project. An inventory of species within parks, she said, 
helps biologists be resource managers rather than crisis managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A doctor needs to know what the patient's normal conditions are," Davis said. 
"Physicians learned what the normal body temperature was by taking a survey. We 
need to learn the vital signs for an ecosystem and how those vital signs vary 
over time." 
</P>
<P>
 The park service isn't alone in its ignorance. The United States has no 
complete inventory of its species, but neither does the rest of the world. And, 
without a more thorough survey, scientists say they can't be sure if a species 
is in trouble, where it is or how to preserve it. 
</P>
<P>
 The cataloguing approach marks a change in the way research funds are 
allocated. During the 1970s and well into the 1980s, biological inventories 
were not considered appropriate topics of study. Instead the focus was on 
individual species, in particular, those that were endangered or posed a 
menace. They have included silver sword plants in the Hawaiian islands, 
melaleuca trees in the Everglades, grizzly bears in Yellowstone and black bears 
in California parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking an individual view of spotted owls or snail darters is bankrupting 
us," Davis said. "In the long run, understanding the habitat and what drives it 
will be more cost effective." It's also more difficult and, in the short term, 
more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveying entire systems over long periods of time is an immense job and one 
that the Department of the Interior met in the truest governmental fashion: It 
established a new bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Biological Survey became operational in November, 1993, with a 
budget of $167.2 million. Personnel from the Interior Department's seven other 
divisions -- including the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service and 
the Bureau of Land Management -- were recruited to staff the new bureau. Davis 
is one of the staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that money came in five-year blocks," he said. "Well, in a 
five-year duration you can't understand natural cycles like El Nino, which 
occurs at seven- to 12-year intervals." 
</P>
<P>
 The narrow slice of time of most studies sometimes mistakes natural 
fluctuations in a population as evidence of permanent decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few years ago, the Foothill yellow-legged frog was common in the Kawaeh 
River of Kings Canyon National Park. But a survey last summer failed to turn up 
a single one. A close cousin, the Mountain yellow-legged, is in steep decline, 
also. 
</P>
<P>
 Graber, a biologist with 15 years of experience in Sequoia and Kings Canyon, 
said the sudden decline in these and other amphibian species around the world 
might indicate a catastrophe or it might not. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is, he said, scientists don't know how populations vary or how much 
of that change is natural. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said that in the case of the kelp ecosystem, scientists aren't 
completely without information. They get some data about commercial species 
that live within the ecosystem from commercial fishermen and the agencies that 
regulate them. A falloff in the abalone harvest helped scientists identify a 
catastrophic population decline. But what about the plants and animals you 
can't eat? 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the project inventories 75 types of plants and animals that are 
bellwethers for the ecosystem. In addition to the kelp forest, researchers also 
monitor 13 categories including intertidal zones, sandy beaches, land 
vegetation and sea birds. 
</P>
<P>
 After 750 man hours spent underwater this year, the results show that the kelp 
and associated animals are continuing their comeback after the devastation of 
the 1983 El Nino -- a warm ocean current from the Equator that reduced diverse 
kelp forests to a barren sea floor containing little more than urchins. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we think happened was that the storms in the winter of 1982 tore out a 
lot of kelp," Richards said. "All that drift kelp became food for urchins so 
they had a great year spawning." 
</P>
<P>
 The following year, with all the kelp gone, Richards said the urchins had to 
start moving around to look for food. So they spread out, overtaking areas that 
were formerly lush kelp forests, and inhibited the regrowth. 
</P>
<P>
 It has taken until now for the fast-growing kelp to regain its former 
distribution in 14 of the 16 survey sites, said biologist Dave Kushner. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the good news from the survey. The bad news, Kushner said, is that 
abalone numbers are still so low it's difficult to monitor them and project a 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
 The inventory and monitoring project should help determine whether abalone 
declines are another result of El Nino or if human factors such as pollution or 
overfishing contributed significantly to the population crash. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California in the 1970s, the eight species of abalone found in 
waters off the Channel Islands National Park numbered as much as 5,000 per 
acre. Now biologists can find densities of only about 12 per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Davis said density is especially important because male abalone release 
clouds of sperm into the water while females release millions of eggs. If the 
male and female are more than one meter apart, Davis said chances of 
fertilization are greatly decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 Only rarely -- perhaps once every six or seven years -- do all the conditions 
line up just right to produce a successful spawning. Eggs eventually develop 
into larvae, and if they aren't eaten by fish or killed by pollution, the 
larvae will eventually grow into baby abalone. 
</P>
<P>
 The habits of juvenile mollusks complicate the monitoring project. Until they 
reach the size of two to three inches, young abalone stay deeply hidden in rock 
crevasses, where they are difficult to count. Researchers couldn't get an idea 
about what the adult population would be in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution was to construct artificial habitats of concrete blocks held 
together by chicken wire. These abalone condos protect the baby gastropods from 
predators and can be quickly disassembled underwater for easy inspection of the 
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at Sequoia National Park, where Foothill yellow-legged frogs were once as 
common to the lakes as abalone were to the Channel Islands, researchers mark 
the progress of recovery by listening not for a robust "ribbittt," but rather 
for an electronic chirp. 
</P>
<P>
 Reintroduced frogs have been implanted with electronic tags so researchers can 
track the population over the long-term. By passing a detecting wand over a 
captured frog, surveyors can identify exactly which frog they are holding. 
</P>
<P>
 "To prevent unnatural change, you need to recognize it and that takes an 
astounding amount of information," said William Tweed, chief of planning at 
Sequoia. Reintroduction of the yellow-legged frogs and general inventory 
monitoring will be the foundation for answering such questions as how much 
change in amphibian populations is natural. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the sort of information," said Tweed, "that's expensive to obtain, but 
priceless to have."

SIGHTS; TWO SOBERING LOOKS AT THE RAVAGES OF AIDS; SHOWS AT VENTURA COLLEGE 
HELP HUMANIZE THE DISEASE AND COMPEL VIEWERS TO THINK OF WORKS UNFINISHED AND 
LIVES CUT SHORT.

<P>
 In connection with AIDS Awareness Month, Ventura College art instructor 
Richard Peterson has curated two separate exhibitions that deal, in different 
ways, with the devastating effects of AIDS on the arts community and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 A posthumous one-man show and a group show by Santa Barbara artists responding 
to the epidemic are affecting in ways that transcend conventional aesthetics. 
At issue here are both the ways in which artists are personally touched and 
driven to action, and also the large task of continuing to stir up public 
awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 Most poignant, and closest to home, is a retrospective show of work by Glenn 
Harris, a Ventura-based artist who died of AIDS last March at age 44. Harris' 
art, in the New Media Gallery, conveys not so much rage as it does a fervent 
appreciation of landscape, life and light. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, who took art classes at Ventura College, was involved in a group show 
last year at Santa Barbara's Channing Peake Gallery called "Living With." What 
we find here is a selection of work from Harris' prolific last decade. It 
showcases his appealingly loose representational style and bold sense of 
composition, which give his landscapes and flora studies a palpable, breathing 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 From the evidence of this sampling, Harris seemed more interested in the 
hidden forms and metaphors in nature than just pursuing idle beauty. "Cacti" is 
an imposing tangle of lines and volumes, and he relished the almost primitive 
construction of aloe. Paintings of koi transform into nearly abstract, 
iridescent splashes of color on black. 
</P>
<P>
 The most engaging example of Harris' painterly eye is a large untitled oil 
painting on the far wall of the gallery. Here, bursts of red blossoms are 
pitted against spare, twining branches, contrasted with a blue sky composed of 
energetic paint whorls. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-portrait finds the artist looking gaunt, resigned to a rueful fate, but 
a more affirmative portrait of the artist can be seen in the painting called 
"Glenn, Gracie, and Geo." The artist, viewed at a distance, is flanked by two 
dogs, walking along a country road raked by rays of waning twilight. 
</P>
<P>
 This painting, flecked with symbolism, becomes a touching leitmotif for the 
whole show, a graceful farewell to a man who found solace in art. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Santa Barbaran artists were involved in the show at Gallery 2, 
"Artist's Response 1994." The work includes such reportage as Nell Campbell's 
photographic field reports from AIDS-related marches and rallies -- here there 
is none of the ironic levity that Campbell often deploys. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired assemblage artist and avowed miniaturist Elena Mary Siff shows tiny 
framed relief pieces commemorating the "Night Without Lights," the December eve 
in 1990 when New York City dimmed its public lighting as a sympathetic gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 The real faces of AIDS can be seen in the centerpieces of photographer Susan 
Jorgensen's series titled "The Last Picture." The photographer depicts departed 
AIDS victims -- many of them prominent Santa Barbara-based AIDS activists -- 
with handwritten texts swirling around their faces. Barb Parmet's "The Spirit 
Lives On" is a photo-tapestry that also grants specific names and faces to 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginny Brush's computer-generated print, "Got Insurance?" presents the sobering 
sentiment of the title, with conceptual roots in Ed Ruscha's word-paintings and 
the Milk Advisory Board's current ad campaign. Rose Bilat's relief pieces, in 
homage to AIDS victims, have an elegance and abstract subtlety that contrasts 
with the more direct impact of the other artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included here are a couple of works by the late John Bommer, a promising 
young Neo-Expressionist artist who studied at UC Santa Barbara and died of AIDS 
in 1986. Like Harris, Bommer was given a posthumous show, at the Contemporary 
Arts Forum in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing works by late artists in this way humanizes the disease and amplifies 
the inherent tragedy. We are compelled to think of the work that went 
unfinished, and of lives cut drastically short. 
</P>
<P>
 LADIES BY NIGHT AND DAY: Canadian-born and Los Angeles-based artist Neil Boyle 
worked for decades as an illustrator for various magazines, and his current 
show at the Conejo Valley Art Museum smacks of illustrator's kitsch. Seeing 
this subtlety-free work in an art gallery makes for a disorienting viewing 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The show goes by the inexplicable title "Last Artist Before the Freeway," but 
lest you think it relates to life in this area before the 101 changed 
everything, think again. The freeway in question is more a mythic concept than 
a site-specific reality. 
</P>
<P>
 He shows wistful images of Wild West saloon life and Native American portraits 
(for good measure), with a caricatured, stereotyped quality implying that the 
artist has watched too many B Westerns. But, in this exhibition, Boyle mostly 
trains his eye on the female form in various stages of undress. He depicts 
prostitutes on the frontier, in a cartoony way rather than with a concern for 
social realism. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something creepy and coy about Boyle's figure studies, especially in 
his titles. The phrase "soiled dove" is a favorite term for these "ladies." A 
painting of a nude on a divan, better than most in the exhibit, is curiously 
tainted with the title "A Frail Flower of the Prairie." His models flash 
come-hither glances and strain under titles like "You See Anything You Like?" 
or "Well, It's About Time!" (Beware titles armed with exclamation points!) 
</P>
<P>
 By the evidence here, Boyle comes off like the last artist before feminism.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: KICKING UP SOME DUST; LOCAL GROUP SHILOH WILL OPEN THE ANNUAL 
GOLD DUST GALA AT SEASIDE PARK, WHICH WILL INCLUDE DINNER, FREE DANCE LESSONS 
AND DANCING. PROCEEDS WILL BENEFIT A LOCAL HOSPITAL.

 Once again, the big social event of the country season has arrived. So dust 
off your boots and get duded up because the fourth annual Gold Dust Gala is a 
dance, a barbecue and benefit. Best of all, it's a special concert by 1990 
Academy of Country Music's Vocal Group of the Year, Restless Heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 700 people are expected to tie on the feed bag, dance and romance the 
night away during the shindig Saturday at Seaside Park, formerly known as the 
Ventura Fairgrounds. This gala will include dinner, free dance lessons and 
dancing. Shiloh, the popular local five-man country group, will again perform. 
The band will open for Restless Heart and provide music after the concert for 
dancing until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 All proceeds from the gala will be used for medical diagnostic equipment at 
Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last couple of years, Restless Heart has performed at the Ventura 
Theatre and opened for Patty Loveless at Santa Barbara's Arlington Theatre. And 
the group just keeps getting better. The energy from their tight vocal 
harmonies and soulful R&B-flavored country-rock tunes could light a city. 
</P>
<P>
 Restless Heart accolades include seven No. 1 records, three gold albums, four 
Grammy nominations and seven Country Music Assn. nominations. When people first 
hear the group, many folks -- including yours truly -- say they can't believe 
it's a country group. That's because the band can sound like straight-ahead 
country, add a saxophone for a bluesy jazz number, or recall the early Eagles 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 But when they play hit after hit in concert, the audience always responds with 
delighted recognition that this one band has generated so many memorable songs 
including "That Rock Won't Roll," "I'll Still Be Loving You," "Why Does It Have 
to Be Wrong or Right," "Fast Movin' Train," "You Can Depend on Me," "Mending 
Fences" and "When She Cries." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For the second year, Crazy Bull instructors, John and Dawn Wilson, were a big 
recent hit teaching nearly 300 new-denim clad people to line dance at the 
"Ventura County Forty Leaguers Annual Barn Dance and Barbecue" in Oxnard. The 
charitable event raised $9,000 for the group's medical and health-field 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you saw the Rhythm Rangers and dance instructor Rick Henderson on CNN or 
"Eyewitness News" Oct. 2, you weren't hallucinating. The night before, they had 
indoctrinated over 300 nouveau cow folk at the first Brentwood Area Chamber of 
Commerce Country & Western Night. Brentwood Honorary Mayor and television 
commentator David Horowitz invited the guys back for next year, saying: 
"Previously the annual mayor's ball has been a formal black tie affair. But 
these people are dancing and having a good time! Before, you couldn't even get 
'em to stand up." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, local fans of the Rhythm Rangers already know it's hard to keep still 
when you hear their music. Watch the column for news of their upcoming CD and 
release party planned for next month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And don't miss Henderson's last Country Night at Nicholby's in Ventura on 
Wednesday. Then watch for the new venue he's developing for Wednesdays and 
catch him there. Alexander's will phase out its Tuesday Country Night at the 
end of this month. But for the next 12 weeks you can find David Graves teaching 
at 7 p.m. Thursdays at the Ban-Dar in Ventura. And the 7 p.m., Two-Steppin' 
Tuesday lessons at Cousin's Country Saloon in Simi Valley are booming and 
overflowing into the parking lot according to instructor, Miss Ila. Heads up, 
cowgirls: "There are more guys than women," she said, "about two to one. And 
the guys are really into learning to dance." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Since launching this column one year ago with a story about last year's Gold 
Dust Gala, I'm glad to report the country scene is still alive and kickin.' And 
thank you, readers, for the positive feedback and support. Details 
</P>

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; CRICHTON 'CONGO' CREW BEATS A PATH TO SIMI

THRILLER IS SHOT AT A POTRERO ROAD HOUSE.

<P>
 It's been a big week for filming in Ventura County with two feature films 
completing production here. Most notable was "Congo," a screen adaptation of a 
Michael Crichton novel. 
</P>
<P>
 The film was shooting near Simi Valley at the Hidden Creek Ranch, a piece of 
Unocal property frequently used as a movie location. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congo" is a story of three adventurers traveling through the African rain 
forest in search of a cache of diamonds that could revolutionize computer 
technology. The three are accompanied by a linguistically trained gorilla named 
Amy who acts as an intermediary between the scientists and a band of killer 
apes guarding the gems. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has to overcome several action-packed impediments including 
cannibals, volcanoes, mutant primates and, not least of all, a Euro-Japanese 
consortium that's also after the diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Production crews spent two days there along with six zebras, half a dozen 
goats, two elephants and a small primate called a bush baby. The scene was of a 
remote landing strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is produced by the husband and wife team of Frank and Kathleen 
Marshall, both of whom used to run Spielberg's production company, Amblin, 
until last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Marshall directs. His directing credits include "Live" and 
"Arachnophobia" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cinematic world is a small one after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Another "Arachnophobia" veteran was wrapping up production on a film in 
Ventura County this week. Wesley Strick, a screenwriter for the spider film, is 
making his directorial debut in an emotional thriller titled "The Tie That 
Binds." 
</P>
<P>
 The picture stars Daryl Hannah and Keith Carradine. Publicists say it's a 
drama of a little girl torn between the loving adoptive parents who could give 
her a stable home and the charismatic but dangerous drifters who give her a 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 The part of the loving home is played by a house on Potrero Road in Thousand 
Oaks. The production spent two and half weeks there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This week's feature at the Ojai Playhouse is "The Wedding Gift," a film from 
the U.K. that's based on a true story about a couple struggling to cope with 
the wife's mystery illness. Sounds like a bummer of a film for a Sunday 
afternoon, but reviewers say the vitality and good humor with which the couple 
meet their obstacles actually makes this an uplifting picture.

EARTHWATCH: SHUTTLE'S EYE IN THE SKY IS A WAY TO FIGHT SMOG; ENDEAVOUR'S 
DOWNLINK TO EARTH PROVIDES A REAL EDUCATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 While the space shuttle Endeavour was flying over Ventura County earlier this 
week, I listened via a special phone hookup by way of the Kennedy and Johnson 
space centers to the astronauts talking about what they saw. Billed as an 
"environmental shuttle," their vehicle carried the most advanced radar ever 
flown in space for environmental monitoring -- capable of delivering 
three-dimensional images, day or night, penetrating clouds, vegetation and even 
the surface of a desert. Also on board was a device to measure carbon monoxide 
accumulation -- one of the constituents of smog -- anywhere on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 I heard veteran astronaut Peter (Jeff) Wisoff explaining to a reporter at Cape 
Kennedy that all this equipment added up to "a global eye to look over our 
environment and keep our world a nice place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Most media reports of the 11-day flight covered what the astronauts were 
looking down on in Asia and the North Sea. But I was able to eavesdrop as 
Wisoff, a Stanford-trained Ph.D, passed right over our coast and confessed to 
homesickness, intoning the landmarks passing beneath him, "Monterey Bay, the 
Big Valley, Ventura, San Diego . . . this is my favorite run." 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't the only person in our neighborhood keeping track of the Endeavour 
mission. Thousand Oaks High School science teacher Susan Thee told me "we load 
data (from the shuttle) right into our school computers via modem and an 800 
number." The data initially comes to Earth as computer bytes -- enough to fill 
a carton of floppies six miles long -- and is turned into pictures at Caltech's 
Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena for scientists and students on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids are doing real live applicable science," Thee said. One class 
project involves comparing, at local sites and around the nation, the health of 
live oak trees near and far from freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The availability of raw scientific data via modem has made possible a new 
approach to teaching science. Recent shuttle flights, she said, "are providing 
perfect stuff, actual data. I don't want textbooks anymore. We can open up the 
whole world to students, not just 500 pages." 
</P>
<P>
 Real-life environmental research has had some real-life effects on the 
students at Thousand Oaks High. According to Principal Keith Wilson, their 
college entrance test scores have improved dramatically since the 
computer-based work started two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a bit up the coast, at UC Santa Barbara, this week's environmental 
shuttle data was greeted as "a bonanza from space," according to UCSB's press 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 I was able to experience the event and its impact on scientists at UCSB by 
listening simultaneously on two phones. On one, astronauts described the Amazon 
forest below them, and, on the other, UCSB biologist John Melack, who is a 
leading expert on the Amazon River's flooding patterns, discussed his research 
based on the radar images being transmitted to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the shuttle's many instruments, the one beaming down data on 
smog-related carbon monoxide is of local interest, since Ventura County, alas, 
gets poor marks from the Environmental Protection Agency in this category. The 
device on the shuttle is scarcely the size of a suitcase, but it has a big name 
and a big environmental purpose: Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites, 
or MAPS. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to pinpoint concentrated carbon monoxide levels -- where they're 
originating and where they're drifting. 
</P>
<P>
 These new shuttle pictures may eventually be combined with other data being 
generated at Caltech and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These 
schools and others are involved in a quest to determine "soot signatures" -- 
the exact source of visible airborne particulates -- eventually perhaps by 
address . 
</P>
<P>
 Polluters beware: Big Brother is watching from the shuttle. And kid brother 
too, if he's enrolled at Thousand Oaks High School. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Science teachers interested in classroom use, via computer modem, of 
environmental radar data being beamed from shuttle flights and satellites can 
call (818) 354-2386. Information on the MAPS project: (804) 864-6124.

ON THE ROAD: PURSUIT OF FAME MUTED BY CHORDS OF HARMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer.

<P>
 For Bobby, it started in the second grade on Long Island. He'd listen to his 
sister struggle through piano lessons. When she was done, he'd sit down and 
play the classical pieces straight through -- by ear. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lee, it started in the first grade in suburban Boston. She'd decided she 
could sing. Others made the same decision. In the Weymouth, Mass., parade, she 
sang "It's a Grand Old Flag." 
</P>
<P>
 Music was always in their homes. Bobby's father, a dentist by day, played 
saxophone in Joe Venuti's swinging band. Lee's mother sang professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby and Lee committed to the uncertain destinies binding so many musicians 
-- they followed their inner pulse. Bobby went to Woodstock in '69, played in a 
rock band, had a high school guidance counselor tell him he ought to get 
serious. He went to the University of Hartford and attended Hartt School of 
music, then dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee loved animals as much as music. Though she was a rave at her high school 
talent show singing Marilyn McCoo's "One Less Bell to Answer" -- "All the guys 
who had bands asked me to be their singer," she recalls -- she followed high 
school with work in veterinary medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 At home in Long Island trying to figure out what to do, Bobby took a call from 
a woman identifying herself as Nat King Cole's daughter. Natalie was starting a 
band. Word was out about Bobby's keyboard wizardry. Would he sign? 
</P>
<P>
 He toured for two years with Natalie Cole and Cool Breeze, playing the Holiday 
Inn circuit but also monthlong gigs at posh resorts in Bermuda. Work in 
Natalie's pre-album days, however, was sporadic. So Bobby dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee was working the nightclub circuit in Boston, getting home at 3 a.m. and 
rising in a stupor at 7 to give pre-surgery injections to dogs and cats. She 
needed the day job money but knew that music played at night was her soul. 
</P>
<P>
 She worked with a band of Bonnie Raitt's former musicians, opening for Stevie 
Ray Vaughn and Kenny Rankin. One night she saw her name on the marquee of 
Boston's Paradise Theater and said to herself: " 'That's it. It's going to 
happen for me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Back home again in Long Island, Bobby got another call. Chubby Checker was 
auditioning pianists. Bobbie tried out on a Thursday. Checker handed him a 
piece of paper and said: "Here's my song list. Learn it by Tuesday. Then we go 
to Detroit and Vegas." Bobby did. In Las Vegas, he found himself in a hotel 
suite getting introduced to Elvis Presley and Linda Lovelace. 
</P>
<P>
 That gig lasted two happy years before Bobby decided "the volume was just too 
much." He dropped out and enrolled at Boston's Berklee College of Music, 
submitting to the mind-bending work of musical theorists. A week before 
graduation, Natalie Cole, two Grammys in the bag, again found Bobby. She gave 
him time to graduate. He joined her tour in Japan and London. In Oakland in 
'76, at the Kool Jazz Festival, they played before more than 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Bobby met Lee. He'd again dropped out of Natalie Cole's band, but this 
time instead of returning home he headed for the Massachusetts woods. There, 
he'd find his musical center. The woods happened to be near Weymouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee got a call from a friend who said there were these guys in a cabin nearby 
who needed a lead singer. Lee is careful about such things -- she has 
show-stopping good looks. But musically, things hadn't actually "happened" for 
her as she'd hoped. She went. She knocked them out with her voice. And she 
knocked Bobbie Orgel out in every way. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee got the job, but soon she and Bobby started playing music alone together 
-- him on synthesizers for the full-band sound, her singing. They fell in love. 
They played the lounge circuit in Boston for handsome, reliable money. Lee 
finally dropped out of veterinary medicine. They married in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 At the suggestion of a Thousand Oaks friend, Bobby and Lee came to California 
in 1986, to Malibu. But they found work up north, at Mandalay Beach's 
precursor, Embassy Suites. They thought Oxnard shores were beautiful, commuting 
ugly. They bought a home, with ocean and mountain views, a block from the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Bobby and Lee are what you might call the house band at The Lobster Trap, 
at Channel Islands Harbor. With sailboats bobbing behind them, they play to 
people bloated on dinner and a fair number who simply come to dance and have a 
good time. No stadium crowds, no names on marquees. No recording deals, no 
press. Just good old rock 'n' roll, played with smarts and soul, by 
unpretentious masters of the form. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone here seems to know Bobby and Lee, and many talk about their lovely 
6-year-old daughter, Jacqueline. Jacqueline, evidently, is not only inclined to 
the visual arts but sings. She has joined her mother more than once in duets on 
Disney tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby recently took his first day job in 20 years as a salesman for Century 
21. Ironically, this pleases him. "As long as we play music at night, and we do 
50 weeks a year, everything feels right," he says, beaming. "Music is our joy. 
We have been lucky and realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee nods in agreement, though she admits she'd love to someday experience The 
Big Tour if, say, a Don Henley needed backup vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 However it goes, one thing is clear: Bobby and Lee Orgel, itinerants who 
followed their pulse, are living out a work and love and family gig that is 
singular. It's the one gig from which neither could imagine dropping out.

PROFILE; WINGING CROSS-COUNTRY FOR THE LOVE OF MUSIC; NEW LEADER OF SANTA 
BARBARA SYMPHONY, A NEW JERSEY RESIDENT, SAYS HER FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS WILL 
BE TO GET TO KNOW HER AUDIENCE.

 Gisele Ben-Dor would love to live in Santa Barbara someday. For now, though, 
she will just have to settle for working there, as the new music director and 
conductor of the Santa Barbara Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Jersey resident's tenure will officially begin this weekend, when the 
symphony opens its 1994-95 season at the Arlington Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 For each of the seven concert weekends this season, the 39-year-old Ben-Dor, a 
wife and mother of two, plans to fly in for rehearsal a week before the 
concerts and fly home following the performances. In between her local stints, 
she will continue to serve as music director of both the Boston ProArte Chamber 
Orchestra and the Annapolis Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben-Dor is a busy woman. 
</P>
<P>
 But she's also a happy woman -- having been selected to head the Santa Barbara 
Symphony from among nine candidates who auditioned last season to replace the 
highly regarded Varujan Kojian, who died last year. Symphony members were 
extremely impressed with Ben-Dor, and she was equally impressed with the 
symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very, very pleasant surprise to me. They are a very good group, and 
I just love this place," said the native Uruguayan, whom Musical America 
magazine selected as one of the "prominent young artists of 1990." 
</P>
<P>
 "The musicians are happy to play. They are happy to be there," she said. "This 
is very important for people with whom you are going to spend a substantial 
amount of time. I think I have things to say musically and there's no way to do 
that without the orchestra being entirely with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Ben-Dor should have a pretty good idea of the importance of a solid 
conductor-orchestra relationship. She has been conducting at one level or 
another since age 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Professionally, Ben-Dor made her debut in 1982 with the Israel Philharmonic. 
Her first big showing in America came two years later when she conducted 
several performances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl. 
She has since led orchestras throughout the United States, Europe, Israel and 
South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben-Dor said her first order of business with the Santa Barbara Symphony is to 
get to know her new audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The programming was quite eclectic last year, but respectful of a 
conservative audience," she said. "I have my own tastes and that might be where 
the main difference may be. . . . I like to bring new things, but that doesn't 
mean they have to be hair-raising, contemporary pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Which means it's unlikely that regular symphony-goers will be seen reaching 
for the earplugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mainstream repertoire is there. There are areas that can still be 
explored, yet again, you still want to play the masterpieces," Ben-Dor said. 
"We are aware that the golden days are over, where you play a Brahms symphony 
and it's all sold out and people are waiting at the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Ben-Dor said she doesn't expect symphony programs to be "any different in 
principle" than those under her predecessor. But she acknowledges that there 
will be some changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to see what works, how we are doing as far as audience 
outreach," she said. "It seems to be quite a mystery why two conductors playing 
the same piece with the same orchestra will get different sounds. It's not just 
interpretation. It's very mysterious. I just hope to bring the best out of the 
orchestra, to raise the artistic level as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Woman conductors still are rare in the symphony world. At this point in her 
career, however, Ben-Dor doesn't give the gender issue much thought, except 
with regard to what she looks like on the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see my very distinguished male colleagues behave in very athletic fashion, 
like they are in a boxing match or rope climbing, doing the most outrageous 
things. It doesn't seem to bother anybody," she said. "I, myself, try to be 
more restrained, without being uncommunicative, God forbid." Details

SHOPTALK; WOOFERS AND TWEETERS FOR (ALMOST) A SONG; HARMON AUDIO OUTLET IS A 
PLACE WHERE AUDIOPHILES AND BARGAIN HUNTERS BOTH CAN BE HAPPY.

 Residents of Ventura County are lucky to be here. The great weather. The beach 
at their back door. And all the advantages of proximity to a major metropolis. 
But now the county is also home to the one and only Harmon Audio Outlet store 
in the country. Whoa. Great sounds at great prices. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of places to buy stereo gear at a discount. But most don't 
carry the truly high-end items this Oxnard outlet store has. There are other 
advantages. Like salespeople who really know their products. (These guys don't 
sell refrigerators and toaster ovens in between the stereo sales.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Harmon Audio Outlet, which is in the Oxnard Factory Outlet on Outlet 
Center Drive, carries merchandise with the names of Pyle, JBL, Infinity and, of 
course, Harmon-Kardon. While all of these companies are now owned by 
Harmon-Kardon, they all retain their signature sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the merchandise consists of "B" stock (which may have minor cosmetic 
imperfections) or slow-moving or discontinued merchandise. All this translates 
to big savings for the customers. At the same time, the store offers a 30-day 
refund policy and full factory warranties. 
</P>
<P>
 From home theaters to car speakers, this outlet store has great deals. We saw 
three complete stereo systems ranging in price from $549 (originally $1,006) to 
$844 (originally $1,536). These systems include CD player, receiver and JBL 
speakers. But any of these components can be purchased separately. 
</P>
<P>
 We had heard that JBL speakers are of high quality, but we were impressed to 
learn that 70% of theaters built in the last decade feature JBL. We chose a 
discontinued pair that were favored by JBL employees. 
</P>
<P>
 If the in-laws who must have everything you have start to turn green, you can 
reassure them. This store accepts mail orders and will ship anything they want. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't be put off by subversive sounding words like subwoofer or tweeter . 
Sign up for one of the store's free seminars to learn more about the technology 
that will best suit your music needs.

JAUNTS; IF YOU FEEL A CHILL, YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH; A WALKING TOUR WILL 
TRACE THE STEPS OF GHOSTS AND GOBLINS WHO SUPPOSEDLY HAUNT SOME OF VENTURA'S 
DOWNTOWN SITES.

 Tranquil downtown Ventura doesn't seem like it would harbor ghosts, but if you 
tag along with ghost expert Richard Senate this weekend, you might find it, 
well, spirited. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate is leading a two-hour walking tour of rumored haunts Saturday as part 
of a series of ghostly goings-on offered by the city this month. Naturally, 
Saturday's spook-filled tour is after dark -- 6 to 8 p.m. (The cost is $6.) 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the evening, you'll know all about Sylvia, whose restless spirit 
is believed by some to be residing at the elegant Bella Maggiore Inn on 
California Street. 
</P>
<P>
 It was back in 1986 that the inn decided to get to the bottom of all the ghost 
talk at the historic hotel. A team of "ghost hunters" -- 14 lay people and 
psychics -- was invited to spend a night there, according to Senate's book, 
"Haunted Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the ghostly presences that supposedly emerged that night, Sylvia's was the 
clearest. She is believed to have been a lonely, desperate prostitute who 
hanged herself in a closet in the inn in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 She's not a gloomy or threatening presence at the inn, though. She likes men, 
according to Senate. "She likes to pinch them on the bottom," he said. 
Sometimes it's the aroma of cheap perfume that signals her presence. Or the 
sound of dancing feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been real active the last few weeks," said Roger Porter, assistant 
manager of the inn. She roams all over the hotel and seems to be a friendly 
presence, although mischievous at times. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests report that they hear or see something strange, he said. Sylvia has 
been blamed for trying to pull the covers off guests at night, or even 
unpacking a suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
 Up California Street at Ventura's majestic City Hall, walkers on Senate's tour 
will hear more ghost stories. Spooks here have been blamed for buzzing police 
on a hidden emergency line after hours or making the elevator stop where it 
shouldn't. And then there is the account of one psychic who claims she saw a 
1940s-looking woman in high heels, red lipstick and tight blue dress striding 
down the corridor, only to vanish with a gust of cold air. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, the old San Buenaventura Mission hasn't escaped ghostly tales either. 
There is the phantom Indian maiden who supposedly wanders the mission in a long 
white dress stained with sea water, the gray-robed figure walking the mission 
grounds, and the most frightening, the headless horseman, perhaps a desperado 
from the last century, according to Senate's book. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, if you saw a ghost it was a terrible thing -- you had one 
year to live," Senate said. "Now it's a good thing to see one; your prayers 
will be answered." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate, employed as a historian by the city, had his own run-in with a ghost 
back in 1978. He was taking part in an archeological dig at Mission San Antonio 
de Padua near King City, when a monk, dressed in robe and cowl, suddenly 
appeared, and then vanished. That encounter steered him toward further psychic 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Saturday's "Ghosts and Ghouls" walking tour, Senate is leading 
a "Phantoms and Folklore" bus tour around Ventura on Oct. 21 and 26 from 6 to 8 
p.m. The bus will stop at several sites including the Olivas Adobe, Cemetery 
Park, and Eternal Comforts, a casket store. The cost is $6. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Oct. 29, Senate will be at Olivas Adobe for spooky candlelight ghost 
tours of the home, built in 1849. It is here that people speculate the dark 
figure wandering the grounds and rooms is the ghost of Dona Teodora Olivas, the 
wife of the adobe's builder and the mother of his 20 or so children. 
</P>
<P>
 Half-hour tours of the Olivas Adobe run from 6:30 to 9 p.m. and cost $3 for 
adults and $1 for children. The tours are billed by the city as 
"bone-chilling." Don't be surprised if chairs rock by themselves, lights 
flicker mysteriously, and phantoms skulk about. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Ghosts and Ghouls" walking tour, led by Richard Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday, 6 to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Ventura's City Hall, California and Poli streets, downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $6. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Advance registration is required for this popular tour. For information 
on this tour and others, and to register, call 658-4726.

FOR THE KIDS; SHOWERING STUDENTS WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE WEATHER; MOORPARK 
HIGH TEACHER'S WRITINGS ARE FULL OF SIMPLE EXPERIMENTS THAT EDUCATE YOUNGSTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tom Baker's obsession with weather goes back to when he was about 5 years old 
-- the time his older sisters locked him out of the house during a rip-roaring 
thunderstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It scared the hell out of me," said Baker, a Moorpark High School teacher. 
But the wonder of it all apparently made quite an impression, because he has 
just published his second book on weather experiments that kids can do. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, "Two Suns and a Green Sky," is a collection of 22 experiments that 
explore weather in an out-of-this-world fashion by asking questions like: Why 
is the planet Venus so hot, even on its dark side? (His first book, "Weather in 
the Lab," was published last year.) 
</P>
<P>
 The books are a good source of ideas for kids faced with the what-to-do blues 
when science fair time rolls around each year. The experiments are generally 
for kids in middle school and above, but younger kids would be intrigued by 
seeing them performed. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the case recently when Baker hauled a couple of his experiments to 
the Barnes & Noble bookstore in Ventura for a little show-and-tell session. 
Before the afternoon was over, he had about a hundred kids believing that 
weather is more than, well, just weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to see this," he said, corralling one little boy at his table full 
of beakers and other gizmos. Baker's exuberance about weather borders on 
frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just flip the switch," he said, pointing to a vacuum pump with a glass cover 
containing a marshmallow, a bowl of dishwashing soap and a jar of rubbing 
alcohol. After the air had been sucked out, the soap bubbled up, the alcohol 
boiled wildly, and the marshmallow had puffed up -- only to shrivel up with a 
poof when air was returned to fill the vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 Miraculously, the jar of boiling alcohol was stone-cold. Although the young 
children gathered around him might not have understood Baker's explanation 
about air pressure, they were impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Science should be like that," Baker confided. "They're excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Children won't need a vacuum pump or any expensive equipment to perform the 
experiments in Baker's books. Baker is a big believer in garage sales, and some 
equipment, like a glass fish tank to house an experiment, can often be found 
cheaply in someone's front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 His experiments are labeled if extra safety precautions are necessary, like 
adult supervision, gloves or goggles, or avoiding eye contact with lights. Each 
one lists materials needed, procedures, observations, questions, diagrams, 
charts, and, in the case of the second book, what implications the conclusions 
have for the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the question about the planet Venus. The book suggests that since the 
planet is plagued with extreme wind and flying dust and sand, maybe the 
friction from the blowing particles is partly responsible for the planet's 
heat. So the experiment involves using a vacuum with a blower nozzle to blow 
sand in a sealed fish tank, and then recording temperatures. Then the book asks 
how all this relates to forest fire dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 And, going to the other extreme, there is the experiment about icebergs. Since 
icebergs are a menace to ships, would the ice melt faster if the water was less 
salty or more salty? 
</P>
<P>
 "What if -- you always ask what if," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 What if Baker, 36, had not been a teacher? In fact, he has already been a 
number of things: a Burbank police officer, an engineer for a Los Angeles radio 
station, a technical writer for Northrop Corp., and he even spent some time as 
a treasure hunter in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, he became a substitute teacher and eventually landed a job as science 
teacher at Westlake High School. His teaching was interrupted by the Desert 
Storm conflict in the Mideast, during which he served as a radioman with the 
U.S. Coast Guard. Currently, he teaches math at Moorpark High School and is 
working on a third book about weather for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a fanatic about weather," he admits. 
</P>
<P>
 His inspiration is his 8-year-old daughter, Noel, to whom he has dedicated his 
books. Together they talk about weather a lot, trading "what ifs," which 
sometimes lead to new experiments. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * READ ON: Thomas R. Baker's two books, "Weather in the Lab" and "Two Suns and 
a Green Sky," are published by TAB Books, a division of McGraw-Hill Inc. They 
sell for $12.95 each.

 There should be some particularly high-quality food to choose from at the 
Pierpont Inn on Sunday, when the Boys & Girls Club of Ventura hosts its second 
annual Garden Party at the Inn . . . by the Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Tables to be set up on the back lawn will be laden with samplings from 26

House, Wheeler Hot Springs, Smokey's restaurant, Nona's Courtyard Cafe, the 
Pierpont Inn (of course) and Barbi's Bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of wineries includes the Ojai Vineyard, Gainey Vineyard, Leeward 
Winery, Santa Ynez Winery and Firestone Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests will receive a wineglass and a plastic tray to carry with them as they 
proceed from tidbit to tidbit. The party will run from 3 to 6 p.m. Tickets are 
$35, with proceeds benefiting the Boys & Girls Club's teen programs. Call 
641-5585. Tickets will also be available at the door. The Pierpont is located 
at 550 Sanjon Road in Ventura.

 Being healthy can be time-consuming.

<P>
 Joggers and iron pumpers know that. So do health-conscious cooks, like Donna 
Wilson, owner of the Natural Foods Cooking School and Ginkgo Leaf Bookstore in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will be at Ventura's City Bakery on Sunday to teach a class, "Natural 
Cooking for Busy People." It's her attempt to show that healthy cooking can fit 
into a tight schedule.

 "People want to eat low-fat. So the question is how to make it tasty and not 
be in the kitchen all day long," she said. "We'll be cooking a complete meal. 
Either one- or two-grain dishes, vegetables and a (miso-based) soup, with an 
eye for having leftovers for a meal the next day." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will show students how to prepare a fermented condiment, too, probably 
what she calls a "quick pickle." Fermentation, she said, is good for digestion 
and brings healthful bacteria into the body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a dreamer. I know people can't stay home all day and cook. What 
happens in the modern world is that people wait too long to eat and then just 
eat whatever is in front of them," she said. "You have to think about your 
food." 
</P>
<P>
 The class will run from 2 to 5 p.m. Cost is $40. Class size is limited. Call 
the Empowerment Place, the class sponsor, at 648-7004.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; WINE CASK OFFERS OLD WORLD CHARM; THE SPANISH-STYLE 
COURTYARD AND INTIMATE DINING ROOM ARE TUCKED AWAY FROM SANTA BARBARA'S TOURIST 
TRAFFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The loveliest dining in Santa Barbara -- inside or outside -- isn't up on a 
hillside overlooking the city and the sea. And it isn't upstairs in a building 
at the edge of the harbor, or nestled in the hills above Montecito at a famed 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
 To my mind, the loveliest dining in town is still right downtown, at the Wine 
Cask, snuggled into the back of the city's Spanish revival-style El Paseo 
retail development. But the Wine Cask is far enough off the tourist traffic 
route that a patron sitting in the restaurant's own courtyard, glass of wine in 
hand, might be reminded of the small, white-walled courtyards of, perhaps, 
Granada. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the spacious yet intimate dining room -- with its high ceiling, 
hand-painted beams and dark carpets -- has a quiet simplicity. The large 
fireplace and bird's-eye maple bar add to the gently romantic feel of the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not difficult to figure out that Doug Margerum, the restaurant's 
operator, is a wine person. The original Wine Cask, which he opened some years 
ago on the other side of the small courtyard, was basically a wine store with a 
small restaurant in the rear. Today, there's a large wine store on one side of 
the courtyard, the restaurant on the other -- and substantial wine lists at 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 In its early years, The Wine Cask seemed to be a restaurant ready to take off, 
ready to mature and become outstanding. The promise is still there. 
</P>
<P>
 Since we last visited the Wine Cask in fall of 1991, Margerum has installed a 
new chef. He is Galen Doi, classically French-trained, but with Japanese roots. 
The result of that combination is an eclectic menu. On occasion this produces 
dishes that, when combined with the environment, make the diner swear this is 
the best restaurant in Santa Barbara. But then you return to find another dish 
that is completely lacking in flavor, inspiration or character. 
</P>
<P>
 The same lack of consistency is apparent in the service, which can be 
professionally excellent or dismally lacking. This may partly be due to the 
restaurant's tip pooling system. But there may be a more obvious explanation: 
The restaurant often has too few servers. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Doi creates some outstanding dishes. His rabbit ($16.50 dinner), braised 
and served with potato gnocchi, is great. The sauce, a red wine broth with sage 
flavorings, accents a dish studded with morels, carrots, pearl onions and 
porcinis. The roast rack of New Zealand lamb ($22.50 dinner), with its jus of 
roasted garlic and herbs, is red and succulent, and the potato croquettes with 
white Cheddar cheese are perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can use a bit of drama in an appetizer, Doi comes up with a flavorful 
won-ton purse ($7.95 dinner) of vegetables and rock shrimp -- deep fried, crisp 
and large. Red chile and plum sauces are served on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot less dramatic but of a superb quality is the small Caesar salad ($5.25 
dinner), with outstanding garlic bread croutons and just the right touches of 
oil, garlic, Parmesan cheese and anchovy. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a light afternoon menu, which boasts a tasty, spicy grilled chicken 
sausage ($6.50 afternoon), with a warm salad of firm white beans, and 
caramelized onions and mustard. The sausage is made of spicy mustard, lots of 
thyme, chopped onions and basil. 
</P>
<P>
 But all is not heavenly, even in this quiet, white, shaded corner of the 
American Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone in the kitchen has a heavy hand with salad dressings. The duck confit 
salad ($7.25 dinner) would be a lovely blend of flavors, including candied 
pecans and Gorgonzola cheese. But the raspberry vinaigrette is so sweet it 
overwhelms everything else. Ditto for the generous Cobb salad ($7.95 dinner), 
with the heavy sweetness of a honey-mustard vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 A stuffed Anaheim chili ($7.95 dinner) appe tizer, with small corn fritters 
and a salsa of tomatoes, red onions and papaya, typifies the menu's eclectic, 
inconsistent nature. When the chiles themselves are hot enough, it's a 
wonderful dish. When they're not, it all just sits there on the plate, 
whimpering. 
</P>
<P>
 An especially dull dish is the potato-crusted halibut ($15.50 dinner). The 
sauteed spinach and shitake mushrooms with a bland cioppino sauce don't help. 
</P>
<P>
 When it's time for dessert, again the kitchen falters, with the exception of 
summer lime cheesecake ($6) with toasted coconut crust, one dessert that was 
good every time. Doi's black-bottom banana cream tart ($6), which sometimes has 
enough bananas and tart chocolate to be sublime, on others has nearly no 
banana, is short on chocolate and, accordingly, devoid of flavor. Details

EYE ON THE PRIZE; GLEEFUL OFFICIALS AND FACULTY HOPE USC'S FIRST NOBEL WILL 
HELP THE CAMPUS FINALLY SHED A STEREOTYPE AS AN ACADEMIC LIGHTWEIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Across the USC campus on Wednesday, the news that chemist George A. Olah had 
brought the university its first Nobel Prize was greeted with joy and grateful 
relief. There is, it seems, nothing like the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 USC has plenty of Heismans in its trophy case but desperately wanted a Nobel. 
"It was," one USC official commented dryly, "like an unscratched itch." 
</P>
<P>
 Never again would USC face the indignity of being left off the list of major 
California institutions with Nobel laureates on their faculty. Stanford has won 
14 prizes, Caltech 12, even cross-town rival UCLA has been able to boast three. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, the University of Southern California. "Certainly, this university 
has wanted a Nobel winner for some time," USC President Steven B. Sample, 
exclaimed on Wednesday in something of an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize, faculty and students explained, gives USC powerful ammunition as it 
tries to shed an old and annoying stereotype as the University of Spoiled 
Children, or worse, the University of Second Choice for serious academics. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is unlikely that George Olah will ever be more famous than another 
USC alumnus, O.J. Simpson, the Nobel was welcomed as a sign that the school 
long regarded by some as more interested in gridiron yardage than international 
acclaim is deserving of new respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Sample said he is pleased that the prize was awarded after a $120-million gift 
from Walter B. Annenberg for communications programs at USC, one of the largest 
grants in the history of higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, the Nobel and the Annenberg grant "will have a synergistic effect. 
That will be very helpful in student recruitment, fund raising and faculty 
recruitment," USC's president said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, perhaps, USC's dean of admission and financial aid thought 
ahead to this Saturday's football game with Stanford when he thought about the 
prize.  
</P>
<P>
 Why not, said Joseph Allen, have the USC marching band spell out the word Olah 
on the playing field? After all, Allen noted, the Stanford band has taunted 
USC's academic reputation in the past by forming the average SAT scores of 
Trojan freshmen, which traditionally lag below the Stanford scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful to have this new symbolism," Allen, more seriously, said of 
the Nobel. "It's strong evidence that this is a place that has improved its 
academic quality and is committed to keeping that going." 
</P>
<P>
 David Merkowitz, public affairs director of the American Council on Education 
in Washington, agreed that the Nobel will boost USC's national reputation. 
"Having a Nobel laureate on the faculty is a sign of enhancement," he said. 
"And I'm sure they will use it for good measure in terms of recruiting and 
marketing." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, USC has been pushing for admission into the big leagues of 
national and international research universities. The school, situated south of 
Downtown, ranks about 20th among American universities in the amount of federal 
research aid it receives, $225 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years before UCLA was admitted to the Assn. of American Universities, USC 
won entrance in 1969 to that premier organization of research institutions, 
whose membership now totals just 56 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the university has been seeking to bolster the reputation of 
its undergraduate programs, long the butt -- justified or not -- of in-house 
criticism and jokes from rivals Stanford and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 USC leaders say that work is bearing fruit in recruiting of better-quality 
students. The current crop of USC freshmen had an average SAT score just over 
1100, a rise of about 100 points over a decade ago, although still well below 
the level at Stanford or UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will help our reputation," agreed Michelle Ladd, a senior who is 
managing editor of the Daily Trojan student newspaper. "People will see us for 
something other than football, for a while at least." 
</P>
<P>
 During the afternoon, several hundred faculty, staff and students gathered for 
a champagne reception in which Olah was applauded for more than a minute as he 
stood at the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 Olah said the prize represented a sign that the university was "maturing," and 
that its image was changing to that of being a serious research institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated as he talked was Katherine B. Loker, an alumna who has donated millions 
of dollars over the years in support of Olah's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so excited I am speechless," she said. "When we first met him, I knew he 
was a Nobel Prize individual." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Olah was the first to call Wednesday morning with news of the award.  
</P>
<P>
 "Then my sister called five minutes later and said, 'Your man won.' " 
</P>
<P>
 During one of the many speeches, Philip Stephens, the chairman of the 
chemistry department, drew a round of laughter when he declared: "It is even 
more important to USC than the football team winning the national 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
 But on a more serious note, he said the award "makes a statement that USC is a 
research university of the first rank." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Nobel may have its most important effect in Southern 
California, USC officials said Wednesday. In some respects, the university is 
more respected out-of-state than locally, partly because of the cross-town 
shade cast by UCLA and Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, it's harder to be recognized in your own back yard," said 
Morton Schapiro, an economist who is USC's dean of letters, arts and sciences. 
He forecast future Nobels for USC faculty, a game usually played by those other 
local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to get your first, but there will be other ones," Schapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the recent edition of The Insider's Guide to the Colleges declared 
that: "USC likes to think of itself as an extended family. Not everyone will 
fit into this clan, but students ready to spend four years partying, meeting 
future business contacts and doing a little studying might want to enroll." 
</P>
<P>
 Olah himself alluded to USC's image in remarks to his chemistry department 
colleagues just hours after getting the big phone call Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you should have a balance in any institution and USC is maturing, 
combining a first-class science and medical research effort with a successful 
athletic program," he said.

 A courtship interpreter: "The enclosed was left behind on a desk in a math 
class at Belmont High School near Downtown L.A.," says the accompanying letter. 
"It's too charming not to share." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter contained a lined sheet of notebook paper that had this request in 
pen, apparently made from one student to another:  
</P>
<P>
 "Can you write in Thai, I need you please and I can't live without you, 
please?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Thai translation is dutifully written underneath in pencil. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath that, there is a somewhat shaky pen version of the Thai translation -- 
as though the infatuated student had practiced it before dispatching the real

 We always knew the UCLA campus was sprawling: By coincidence, we heard from 
former Times staffer John McCafferty, who writes that on a bus trip through 
Seoul, South Korea, he saw an eye-catching, non-Korean sign -- something you'd 
be more likely to see in Malibu, or Munich. It said: "UCLA Coffee Hof."

 A plea to our readers: In announcing plans to form a new studio, moguls Steven 
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen omitted any mention of its name. 
We suspect the issue may be stalled in delicate negotiations.

 The most obvious name for the trio has already been taken by another studio: 
TriStar. Daily Variety's headline on the venture hinted at still another 
possible name: "Three Men & Their Baby." We also think The Three Rich Guys 
Studio has a nice ring.

1980 book "Mind at Play" by Jerome Singer and Ellen Switzer, which contains a 
quote from a Playboy interview. A football player had told the magazine how he 
visualizes spectacular athletic feats in his mind: "Cats come up to me 
afterward and say: 'How'd you know to do that?' I tell them, 'Hey, I'm in my 
car diving down the San Diego Freeway or a freeway somewhere else, and I'm

SCOTT HARRIS: SAFETY MIGHT BE THE HOTTEST FASHION TREND

 Every school has a Mrs. Dvorak, which is to say that every school has an 
"attendance secretary," a kind of watch commander who sits in the main office 
behind a helpful name plate. It's their job to field questions, minimize chaos, 
maximize order. At Santa Clarita's La Mesa Junior High, this means an active 
role in the new clothing police. 
</P>
<P>
 So when 13-year-old Shaun Hicks showed up for school this week in the right 
pants but the wrong shirt, it was Mrs. Dvorak -- Melanie to friends -- who 
enforced the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're, like, nobody wants to wear these things!" Shaun complained as he 
tucked in an official school T-shirt. " Everybody thinks they look dorky!" 
"Well," Mrs. Dvorak said, smiling, "I think you look very nice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you're in seventh grade, grown-ups tend to be clueless. Their idea of 
"nice" rarely conforms to your idea of "cool." Teen fashion gets its cues from 
pop music: the baggy clothes of rap and hip-hop, the black "hesher" look 
inspired by heavy metal, the tattered jeans and flannel of grunge. In their 
conservative ensembles of white, black and taupe, La Mesa's students could pass 
for Pat Boone fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Those dorky, dweebish feelings should pass quickly, however, because they're 
all in this together. And maybe someday they'll find solace in the knowledge 
that they were at the forefront of a new fashion trend, given the adoption this 
year of a state law that sanctions uniforms in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 To the dismay of some civil libertarians, uniforms may appear at a public 
campus near you, as more educators and parents look to an old parochial school 
strategy in an effort to impose a sense of order. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniforms, educators point out, can do something as simple as help teachers 
keep track of students during field trips. Students, they say, will be less 
distracted by fashion and peer pressure, and more focused on classroom 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest selling point for parents, however, is campus safety. School 
officials would have an easy time identifying outsiders on school grounds. The 
elimination of baggy clothing would make it tougher for students to bring 
contraband on campus. By discouraging the "gangsta" style, educators and 
parents hope to minimize the various effects of gang culture. 
</P>
<P>
 To those who worry about the cost, La Mesa Principal Rochelle Neal says 
parents would actually spend less on uniforms than they would on clothes at the 
mall. To those who say the uniforms muzzle self-expression, Neal says students 
can focus more on expressing themselves in classroom assignments and campus 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any harm," Neal says. "I see only good." 
</P>
<P>
 More skeptical views have come from predictable sources. State Sen. Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica) predicts "inevitable friction" between parents and children. 
The American Civil Liberties Union is monitoring the implementation of uniform 
policies at schools in Long Beach, Ventura County and elsewhere. Liz Schroeder, 
an ACLU associate director, says that often school officials "are not 
forthcoming" in advising parents of a provision in the state law that enables 
them to opt out of the uniform policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder suggests that such policies may not achieve their purported aims. In 
some school districts, educators talk about the danger of gangs, but then 
implement a uniform policy only at elementary schools. "It's difficult to see 
how uniforms prevent gang problems in elementary schools, when elementary 
schools aren't prone to having gangs," Schroeder says. "It would be more 
logical in junior high and high school." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No gang troubles in elementary school? Shaun Hicks' mother, Pamela Hardine, 
tells a story that should remind us grown-ups that childhood isn't what it used 
to be, and explains why she thinks her boy looks so nice in his new La Mesa 
uniform, much nicer than when he wore those baggy pants to his old elementary 
school in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 A few facts are relevant. Understand that Shaun is black, and understand that 
he's big for his age. He looks 16 now, and, as his mother puts it, "he looked 
14 when he was 10." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many kids, Shaun innocently talked his mom into buying him the baggy 
pants that looked so cool. "I was so naive," she said. "I figured, this is 
great, because he'd grow into these pants. Boy, he's in style and we're saving 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, she figures it all fit a pattern: Shaun's size, race and 
clothing made the older kids, the gang kids, take an interest. He told about an 
argument with a boy who brandished a gun and threatened to kill him. That's 
when Shaun's folks figured it was time to move out of the San Fernando Valley, 
to these new suburbs beyond the old suburbs, hoping to distance themselves from 
the big, bad city. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's why Shaun's mom thinks his new school clothes don't look dorky at 
all.

A MAN OF PEACE? JURY IS STILL OUT; NOBEL COMMITTEE WOULD BE PREMATURE TO TAP 
PLO'S YASSER ARAFAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are many compelling reasons the world should acknowledge and even reward 
the recent progress toward peace in the Middle East. That said, however, the 
decision reportedly made by the Nobel Prize Committee to grant its prestigious 
1994 Peace Prize to both Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman 
Yasser Arafat is both premature and problematic.  
</P>
<P>
 A formal announcement by the usually staid and secretive Nobel committee is 
due Friday in Olso. But already word of Arafat's selection, as well as 
lingering questions about the long-term viability of the nascent peace process, 
has justifiably generated controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Nobel committee created this kind of stir was 1973, when it 
split the prize between Henry A. Kissinger, secretary of state in the Nixon 
Administration, and North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho. It turned out that peace would 
not return to Vietnam until two years later, and not without a great deal more 
bloodshed.  
</P>
<P>
 Given that experience, it is indeed peculiar that the committee would move so 
quickly to honor the likes of Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking nothing away from last year's historic Israeli-PLO agreement, which 
called for normalization of relations and began the process of transferring 
autonomy to the Palestinians in the long-disputed West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
there are still troubling questions about the PLO leader's commitment to peace. 
</P>
<P>
 For one there is Arafat's historical link to terrorism, including the 1972 
attack on Israeli athletes taking part in the Olympics at Munich. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it is worth remembering that his sudden cooperative spirit has coincided

 Time will tell if Arafat is truly deserving of the highest peace honor in the 
world. After all, other leaders in the Middle East -- the late Israeli Prime 
Minister Menachem Begin comes to mind -- were able to overcome the violent 
politics of their early years to eventually be regarded as statesmen and even 
peacemakers. But that time has not yet come for Arafat.

THE BROOM MUST SWEEP CLEAN; SUBWAY OFFICIAL FIRED; NOW HIS AGENCY SHOULD GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decision to fire Edward McSpedon as the head of the corporation that is 
building Los Angeles' subway and trolley system was not easy for either the 
board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority or its chief executive, 
Franklin E. White. But it was a necessary first step toward restoring federal 
funding -- and public credibility -- to the troubled mass transit project. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the MTA board, a 13-member body made up of local elected officials 
including Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and the five Los Angeles County 
supervisors, must take the next step and abolish the quasi-independent 
subsidiary that McSpedon ran, the Rail Construction Corp. The RCC may have 
served a purpose when it was created in 1990 -- keeping the subway project from 
being slowed by political infighting among local transit agencies -- but it has 
outlived its usefulness. There is only one big transit agency now, the MTA, and 
the RCC has become a political albatross that could slow completion of the 
badly needed mass transit system. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, McSpedon was not solely to blame for the construction problems 
that have plagued the Red Line subway -- among them Downtown tunnels built with 
concrete thinner than specified and the recent collapse of Hollywood streets 
above tunnel excavations. Independent studies of the subway's engineering and 
construction have found sufficient blame to go around -- enough for the RCC and 
various private contractors too. 
</P>
<P>
 However, though his supporters -- and even White -- praised much of the work 
he had done in overseeing the rail project during his 10 years with the MTA, it 
was McSpedon who rightly had to answer for the problems. That was especially so 
after the federal government, which is paying for most of the subway project, 
suspended $1.6 billion needed to extend the subway into the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no guarantee that McSpedon's ouster will get federal money flowing 
again. In fact, Washington could decide to wait a good, long time before 
reopening its checkbook -- say, until McSpedon's replacement is chosen and 
settles into the job. And that delay could go so far as to kill the project. 
That's why the MTA board must instead kill the RCC, as soon as possible, and 
put final responsibility for the project where it belongs, with White and the 
MTA board. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the federal government can be assured that if there are any more subway 
problems the officials responsible can be easily identified and held 
accountable. Surely Riordan, who got elected by promising to bring sound 
business practices to local government, and the supervisors, who at least give 
lip service to similar ideas, can see the logic in that. Now they must take the 
logical next step.

RIGHTS WATCH; WOUNDED BUT ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Colorado Supreme Court Tuesday dealt that state's mean-spirited 
anti-homosexual amendment its fourth consecutive legal setback. Alas, the blow 
may not be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 Amendment 2, adopted by Colorado voters in 1992, would prohibit local 
governments from outlawing discrimination against homosexuals and would strike 
down ordinances already on the books in Denver, Boulder and Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
 The discriminatory measure was challenged immediately after it passed, with 
54% of the vote, and a lower court rightly blocked its enforcement.  
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court held that because Amendment 2 singles out a class of 
people for denial of basic rights it violates the equal-protection clauses of 
the Colorado and U.S. constitutions. "The right to participate equally in the 
political process is clearly affected by Amendment 2," the court wrote.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the matter is not dead yet. Colorado's attorney general said she will 
appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. But she doesn't have to, and Gov. 
Roy Romer should direct her not to appeal. The long effort to implement this 
unfair law generated a costly nationwide boycott of Colorado's tourist business 
and a tarnished image for the state.  
</P>
<P>
 Oregon and Idaho voters should pay attention to Tuesday's ruling. Next month 
they will decide on statewide measures similar to Amendment 2. If majorities 
vote "yes," Oregon and Idaho should not be surprised if these manifestly unjust 
proposals meet the same fate as Amendment 2 -- with the same high political and 
fiscal costs.

HEALTH PREMIUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why does government have to make things so complicated? It is obvious to 
middle-class, employed but uninsured Americans like me that we have a 
health-care crisis. Two years ago, I was driven into personal bankruptcy by the 
first major illness in my then-51 years of life; the hospital bill by itself 
was over $227,000 -- and then the doctor bills started coming in! 
</P>
<P>
 But I don't think we need a bureaucratic monstrosity such as the (hopefully) 
now-dead Clinton plan, or California's Proposition 186. I'm no economist, but 
it seems to me that what we really need is some incentive for employers to 
provide health-care coverage through private carriers. So, I propose that 
employers be given tax credits for the health care premiums they pay in 
addition to business-expense tax deductions that they already receive. Maybe 
small employers (with, say, 1-49 employees) could receive credit equal to two 
times the premiums they pay, medium-sized employers (50-100 employees) 1 1/2 
times, and large employers (with over 100 employees) could receive tax credit 
exactly equal to the premiums they pay. Under such a plan, I believe that most 
employers would pay at least part of the premiums for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't this be an awful lot of money for the government to lose? Well, no. 
If a plan like this were adopted, I believe that employment in such fields as 
insurance, health care, and pharmaceutical research and development would 
skyrocket -- and payroll taxes raised from these new jobs would more than take 
up the slack.

<P>
 Colman McCarthy hit the nail on the head in his commentary on Jimmy Carter and 
his Haitian negotiations (Oct. 3).  
</P>
<P>
 I've heard some people claim that Colin Powell, by describing the military 
holocaust which would surround Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras if he resisted, was the 
chief cause of the dictator's withdrawal from power.But McCarthy puts the 
praise where it is justly due, on Carter's shoulders. By appealing to Cedras' 
better instincts, by helping Cedras to realize the link between his own and his 
family's humanity, and that of others, Carter caused Cedras to pause and 
reassess his actions. It was simple humanity that Carter used with Cedras.

 * McCarthy concludes with " . . . what has violence ever accomplished -- 
besides more of it, which is the definition of the 20th Century." I would like 
to suggest that the use of violence led to the crushing defeat of Nazism. One 
wonders what kind of world would we have today if the century's most enduring 
peacemakers -- Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., Jane Addams -- had 
taken their nonviolent techniques up against the tender mercies of Adolph 
Hitler. What if the alternative of violence had been rejected by our country, 
what then would be the definition of the 20th Century? 
</P>
<P>
 And who would want to live in a society such as we live in today without the 
potential and actual employment of violence against society's lawbreakers? It 
was good for Carter to appeal to the "better side" of Cedras. But it didn't 
hurt the helpful outcome that 15,000 well-armed troops were on their way.

GAS CHAMBER BARRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Judge Bars Use of Gas Chamber in Executions," Oct. 5: 
</P>
<P>
 The State of California clearly has a difficult time dealing with the issue of 
ridding itself of certain degenerates who have shown through their past and, 
often, repeated behavior that they are either unwilling or unable to coexist 
peaceably with their neighbors. This is not entirely surprising, though. 
Personally, I don't believe that anyone obtains any real or lasting 
satisfaction from the execution of a criminal, no matter what the crime. Deep 
inside we would rather that the crime had not been committed at all, than a 
brute savage be put out of his misery. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the fact of the matter is that through some sense of perceived 
justice California has managed to retain the option of utilizing the death 
penalty, and there is still a "humane" method available with which to carry out 
that sentence. So why on earth are we arguing semantics? Whether there is only 
one acceptable method or a hundred, California still has the ability to kill 
those chosen few who have earned that fate through their deeds and in 
accordance with our laws. 
</P>
<P>
 What really strikes me is the hopelessly misplaced sense of altruism of our 
society. We will spend so much effort concerning ourselves with the possibility 
that a brutal criminal may agonize one moment longer, while we make no 
significant effort to foster among ourselves the real love and sense of 
belonging which would have prevented most crimes from occurring in the first 
place.

 * When I read the article, my reaction was "I knew it." In 1977, when the 
Legislature reinstated the death penalty, I saw that the use of hydrogen 
cyanide, which turns into a corrosive acid when it strikes the moist membranes 
of the lungs, to execute death sentences would lead to an obvious 
constitutional challenge. I wrote a letter to then-state Sen. George Deukmejian 
and suggested that the use of poison gas be replaced by a method based on so 
modifying the gas chamber that it can be rapidly filled with pure nitrogen gas. 
If that method were used, the condemned murderer would die from anoxia, which, 
the Navy Flight Surgeon's Manual assures us, is completely painless. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly neither Deukmejian nor any of the other bright boys and girls in the 
Legislature wanted to be concerned with such considerations. Do you suppose 
that our legislators might be willing to listen to some good advice now or 
would that be expecting too much from them for the miserable pittance that we, 
the people, pay them?

 The 387 individuals on Death Row all deserve to be on Death Row. All these

 A great percentage of these Death Row inmates have committed such heinous 
crimes, why should we give a damn how they die? 
</P>
<P>
 Does anybody think even for a second that they considered how cruel and 
inhumane their crime was? No! Not for a second. Why should society give them 
any thought in how they should die?

300-M.P.G. CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now comes Amory Lovins, an environmentalist with no professional experience in 
auto design, who announces that the 300-miles-per-gallon auto lies at hand. His 
friend Donella Meadows, who has even less pertinent experience, eagerly praises 
him (Column Left, Oct. 4). 
</P>
<P>
 I have a little challenge for Lovins: Design and build your vehicle, and see 
if anyone will buy it.  
</P>
<P>
 Quite a few inventors already have built cars such as Lovins envisions. In the 
local area, Doug Malewicki of Irvine got 150 m.p.g. in his "California 
Commuter." He made it very small, flimsy and lightweight, with room for only 
the driver. Others have gone so far as to build autos powered by solar cells. 
However, no such vehicles have ever reached production. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? In constant dollars, gasoline prices are close to their all-time 
low. Indeed, prices at the pump have shown little increase in over a dozen 
years. People nevertheless want gas mileage -- but they also want size and 
comfort, power and acceleration, low cost, and enough ruggedness to offer hope 
in a collision. A Honda or Geo Metro offers these things, while also giving 
good fuel economy. The California Commuter does not, while Lovins' creation 
would be even worse. In sum, the day of the 100-m.p.g. car will be long in 
dawning. The reason is that whereas Lovins and Meadows regard good mileage as 
the sole goal in auto design, car buyers in the real world demand much more.

PERSPECTIVE ON IRAQ; BART SIMPSON OF GULF ACTS UP AGAIN; SADDAM IS A MONSTER OF 
OUR OWN MAKING; WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OUR INTERESTS ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO GO 
IT ALONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD STEEL, Ronald Steel teaches international relations at USC and is 
author of the forthcoming book Temptations of a Superpower (Harvard University 
Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again the Iraqi chicken has come home to roost on an American President's 
lap. There is a reason for this. Saddam Hussein is more than a neighborhood 
bully. He is our Bart Simpson: the clever little fellow who periodically 
embarrasses and outsmarts us, but whom we cannot totally disavow because he is 
partly our creation and useful to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Reagan fed weapons and intelligence information to Saddam during the 
Iran-Iraq War to prevent Tehran from winning. He did this even though Saddam 
had started the war with an aggression no less blatant than that against Kuwait 
in 1990. The difference was that, given the choice, we preferred the atheistic 
to the religious butcher, the general to the ayatollah. 
</P>
<P>
 The original problem was, of course, of our own making. In the 1970s, Richard 
Nixon and Henry Kissinger poured weapons into Iran to build it up as the 
linchpin of our interestsin the Middle East. The shah was to be our deputy 
sheriff or our "regional surrogate." 
</P>
<P>
 This is why they looked the other way when the shah, needing to pay for his 
expensive new military toys, set off a dizzying price spiral that drove up the 
price of oil from a few dollars a barrel to more than $40 and set off a round 
of inflation throughout the industrialized world. It was worth it, they 
thought, if the shah would keep the lid on a volatile area. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems never to have occurred to them that the shah might be overthrown and 
replaced by someone less obliging. When that happened, Washington shifted its 
affections from Tehran to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years later, Saddam repaid us by invading Kuwait. This was not the 
scenario we had anticipated. He was supposed to direct his armies east, toward 
the fist-shaking Iranians, not south, toward the Kuwaitis, who just wanted to 
have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did Saddam do it? Because he thought that the Americans would let him. 
Indeed, the signals he got from the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad, and even from 
George Bush, led him to believe that we would wink if he slapped down the 
greedy Kuwaitis and worked out a compromise. However, when he grabbed for the 
whole thing, he called into question the U.S. guarantee to neighboring Saudi 
Arabia and had to be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Pushing his army back across the border cost billions of dollars -- most of 
which we persuaded others to pay. Yet something funny happened. Rather than 
destroying Saddam's army so that it could not come back to Kuwait another day, 
or putting him in a maximum security cell, we deliberately let them both 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
 This strategy -- mapped out by Bush, together with Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Joint Chiefs Chairman Colin 
Powell -- was ostensibly designed to prevent the creation of a "power vacuum" 
in the area. They wanted to give Saddam a bloody nose so that he would leave 
Kuwait, but keep him strong enough to "balance off" the menacing mullahs in 
Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddam Hussein knows that he can manipulate U.S. officials because they think 
that they need him. His army is intact not because we were softhearted, but 
because we wanted it to be used for other purposes. But Saddam has his own 
agenda: getting the economic sanctions lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwait is America's Achilles' heel. All Saddam has to do is to shift his 
troops around and the United States sends an army across the world to protect 
the Kuwaitis. Why? Because we fear that if Saddam grabs Kuwait and scares the 
Saudis he will try to raise the price of oil. It is unlikely that he would be 
able to do so, given abundant alternate sources. Further, the price of oil is 
now cheaper, inflation-adjusted, than it was 20 years ago when the first price 
hikes began. One can also ask how "cheap" Kuwaiti and Saudi oil is if it 
requires billions of dollars to protect weak and indolent regimes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kuwait, U.S. policy-makers face a real dilemma. They are trying to protect 
a weak colony against a strong neighbor that they want to discipline but not 
seriously weaken. Saddam is bad, but the ayatollahs are worse. Logic would 
dictate that the United States ally itself with one of the major powers of the 
region to lessen the burden. Instead, we have taken on both in order to keep 
the oil kingdoms afloat. The result is that we are being diddled by Saddam 
Hussein, who can siphon off billions of our dollars every time he shifts his 
troops around. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three ways out of this self-imposed conundrum. One, if the 
oil-guzzling states of the industrialized world care about "cheap" Kuwaiti oil, 
let them pay the United States to do the dirty work, as they did in the Gulf 
War. Two, if our partner-competitors won't pay their share, and if we really 
believe that Iranian-style fundamentalism is a menace to the world, we should 
work out a deal with Saddam over Kuwait and let him "police" the Persian Gulf 
for us. Three, if that smells too bad, we could balance off power against 
power: work out an accommodation with Tehran so that Saddam will have to worry 
too much about his eastern frontier to play games in the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton inherited a mess from his predecessors and he had little 
alternative, in the short run, than to make the response he did. But now he 
will have to go beyond a bankrupt policy of superpower policing of tinderboxes 
and disasters, whether in Kuwait, Korea or Haiti, and make a cool assessment of 
the interests of a nation that is very strong, but not rich enough to run a 
global fire brigade.

COLUMN RIGHT / DAVID HOROWITZ: WHEN STRENGTH IN A WIFE ISN'T PC; THE VERY 
PEOPLE DEFENDING HILLARY CLINTON'S INVOLVEMENT ATTACK ARIANNA HUFFINGTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOROWITZ, David Horowitz is president of the Los Angeles-based Center 
for the Study of Popular Culture. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For supporters of Michael Huffington, the vicious attacks on his wife, Arianna 
-- in particular, the accusation that she wears the intellectual pants in the 
Huffington family and that this is somehow a negative for his campaign -- have 
had one salutary effect: They have exposed the hypocrisy of liberals like 
Dianne Feinstein and state Democratic Party Chairman Bill Press, who normally 
claim to have an interest in women's rights.  
</P>
<P>
 Arianna Stassinopoulos' intellectual achievement -- beyond any possibility of 
dispute -- exceeds that of any other wife in American politics, not only in 
this election year, but for the past 50. If she had not had the bad manners to 
be politically incorrect -- if she were the wife of a Democrat -- the liberal 
chorus, including Feinstein and Press, would be loudly condemning her attackers 
as sexists fearful of any sign of strength in a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The first woman president of the Cambridge Union -- an elite English debating 
society -- Arianna Stassinopoulos published her first book on feminism when she 
was 23, and went on to write acclaimed biographies of Pablo Picasso and Maria 
Callas, as well as a philosophical work titled "After Reason." She was an 
internationally celebrated writer before she met Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Would Press and the others prefer that senatorial candidates choose wives who 
are intellectual inferiors to preserve the appearance of male dominance in all 
areas of public achievement? Or, if they do have the bad judgment to marry 
women with strong intellectual profiles, would he propose that they keep their 
wives in the closet for the duration of their campaigns? I know he does not 
have such thoughts about Hillary Rodham Clinton. Perhaps that's because she 
shares his political opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Press and the other attackers are careful to cloak their liberal 
biases and petty male resentments in high-minded concern about religious gurus 
and New Age spiritualism. It is hinted that Mrs. Huffington is the captive of a 
New Age spiritual cult, despite the fact that she is a practicing Greek 
Orthodox. There is nothing new in finding the ugly face of religious bigotry 
alive and well in electoral campaigns. But the disdain for a woman who is able 
to think and actually express herself in print is evidenced in the failure of 
the anti-Arianna chorus to read what she has written. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a passage from her current book, "The Fourth Instinct," which bears 
directly on the question of religion and politics: 
</P>
<P>
 The Founding Fathers grounded America in spiritual absolutes. The Declaration 
of Independence hinges upon the premise that "all men are created equal," which 
Lincoln called "the father of all moral principle." It is a truth self-evident 
only in terms of our spiritual heritage. Men are not self-evidently equal in 
talent or intelligence or physical appearance or by any other first-, second- 
or third-instinct criteria. They are equal by a standard perceived only by the 
fourth, our instinctive grasp of the absolute. This does not mean that America 
was founded as a "religious nation." The Founding Fathers were not political 
men engaged in a spiritual enterprise. They were deeply spiritual men engaged 
in a political enterprise.  
</P>
<P>
 Here we see her religious concerns as they relate to politics: the importance 
of grounding a political system in an absolute morality, which in the case of 
America is those self-evident truths enumerated in the Declaration of 
Independence and secured by the Constitution; her view that these absolute -- 
and therefore inalienable -- truths derive from what she calls the fourth, or 
spiritual, instinct; her understanding that this does not mean that our 
political system should be subordinated to a religious system, but that if our 
political system ignores its moral and spiritual bases, it does so at its own 
peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I ask: Would you not wish the writer of the above passage to be more, 
rather than less involved in her husband's campaign for political office?

COLUMN LEFT / ROBERT SCHEER: PROP. 187: STICK IT TO THE KIDS; IT'S A 
DEMAGOGUE'S DEAD END AND WOULD DO NOTHING TO CONTROL ILLEGAL MIGRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SCHEER, Robert Scheer is a former Times national correspondent. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So you want to get tough on illegal immigration? Then seal the border and 
crack down at airports. Require everyone in this country -- man, woman or child 
-- to carry a foolproof identity card and mandate jail time for any employer 
who hires someone not in possession of such a card. Then you're talking. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't tell me that Proposition 187 will do any of that. The initiative -- 
labeled "save our state" and promoted by Gov. Pete Wilson -- is a demagogue's 
dead end. 
</P>
<P>
 First, it deceives with the notion that the states, rather than the federal 
government, can stop the flow of illegal immigration. The states can't, and all 
the governor is doing is stoking the passions of the moment for short-term 
political gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration is a federal responsibility, and both Republican and Democratic 
occupants of the White House have looked the other way on the premise that 
immigration bolsters rather than hurts the economy.  
</P>
<P>
 Second, Proposition 187 aims primarily at hurting children, who are not the 
ones who make the decisions to come here or to leave. The folly of punishing 
children for their parents' decisions was recognized in a 1982 Supreme Court 
ruling that held a very similar Texas law unconstitutional. Penalizing 
children, the court held, "is an ineffectual -- as well as unjust -- way of 
deterring the parent." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a punk's game to beat up on kids, but that's what the governor is doing 
in supporting Proposition 187. The only new provisions are a ban on immigrant 
kids going to school along with a bizarre restriction on the purchase of health 
care by immigrants. The rest of the tough-sounding language is bogus. There are 
already laws on the books that make it a crime to sell phony green cards; the 
governor has the authority to provide information to the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service on immigrants convicted of crimes. Nor are the 
undocumented now eligible for free non-emergency public health care or welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 What the proposition does that is truly stupid is to prevent hospitals that 
receive public funding from providing care that the undocumented are willing to 
pay for. Imagine forcing people to forgo timely medical treatment they would 
pay for, in effect telling them to get seriously ill so they would then be 
treated free in emergency rooms.  
</P>
<P>
 Even more mischievous is the proposition's goal of tossing out an estimated 
300,000 kids, from kindergartners to high school seniors about to graduate. 
This is a "snitch on kids" measure. Proposition 187 mandates that "Each school 
district shall provide information to the state superintendent of public 
instruction, the attorney general of California and the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service regarding any enrollee or pupil or parent or guardian 
attending a public elementary or secondary school in the school district 
determined or reasonably suspected to be in violation of federal immigration 
laws." 
</P>
<P>
 You've got to turn the kid in to the INS even if he or she is a straight-A 
student. You've also got to turn in the parents who kept that kid hitting the 
books. Even a child who is a U.S. citizen by virtue of having been born here 
would have to inform on parents whose status is undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, we just want to follow the law, Wilson and the other proponents of this 
mean-spirited measure proclaim. Hardly, when the U.S. Supreme Court has already 
ruled that denying undocumented children education violates the 
equal-protection clause of the 14th Amendment.  
</P>
<P>
 There are already plenty of state and federal laws and regulations that are 
constitutional and that, if enforced, would make undocumented labor much less 
attractive. If the governor was serious, he would crack down on agribusiness, 
whose profits are directly dependent on the exploitation of undocumented labor. 
But those same profits bankroll his campaigns, so it's easier to make children 
the target. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Congress increased fines and jail penalties for employers of the 
undocumented, but the law has never been enforced. Indeed, Proposition 187 is 
the brainchild of two top INS officials who failed in this effort: Alan Nelson, 
a former INS commissioner under Ronald Reagan and George Bush, and Harold 
Ezell, who was INS Western regional commissioner at the same time. As Carl 
Shusterman, a former INS prosecutor, pointed out, "not a single employer of 
illegal aliens went to jail during their tenure." 
</P>
<P>
 Having failed to enforce sound law already on the books, these failed 
bureaucrats, Wilson included, now seek to impose a new law that fails miserably 
to deal with the real issues of immigration. But unfortunately, it has already 
proved wildly successful in playing politics with voters' fears and children's 
lives.

MORNING BRIEFING: OPEN LETTER TO WATSON: TUNE IT OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an April 11 letter to Masters chairman Jackson Stephens and CBS golf 
producer Frank Chirkinian printed in the November issue of Golf Digest, Tom 
Watson wrote that Gary McCord is "the Howard Stern of TV golf," adding that he 
should be fired.  
</P>
<P>
 Watson was angry over McCord's irreverent remarks at April's tournament, 
including "They don't cut the greens at Augusta, they use bikini wax." 
</P>
<P>
 McCord was dropped from the network's coverage of the 1995 Masters, but he is 
hardly in the same league as shock jock Howard Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the USC record for the longest run from scrimmage? 
</P>
<P>
 Censorship? After top-ranked Florida beat Louisiana State, 42-18, last 
Saturday, Gator Coach Steve Spurrier still wasn't satisfied with his team's 
performance, saying:  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not near as good as all you guys (media) think we are, so quit saying 
we are." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, coach, you're lousy.  
</P>
<P>
 No respect: The Las Vegas Posse of the Canadian Football League is struggling 
for fan support, and Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle suggests 
that part of the problem might be the league's lack of stature. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the last game," kicker Carlos Huerta said, "I was signing some 
autographs and I must have had seven people ask me if I was going to turn pro 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Posse: Coach Ron Meyer, a former NFL head coach, is disgusted with CFL 
officiating, saying: "I've been fined by the league so much, I have no salary." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise: George Foreman told Sport magazine about a recent stay at a Los 
Angeles hotel. It seems that George couldn't get his key to work until he 
realized he was at the wrong room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine if somebody opened that door and saw me ," Foreman said. "I'd have 
said, 'Excuse me, but did you order a boxer?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Overlooked: Athlon magazine, in picking all-time basketball teams for schools, 
didn't include USC's Ralph Vaughn, an All-American in 1940 who led the Trojans 
to a 20-3 record and into the NCAA semifinals before losing to Kansas, 43-42. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1960, Bill Mazeroski hit a home run in the bottom 
of the ninth to give Pittsburgh a 10-9 victory over the New York Yankees in 
Game 7 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Dwight Ford, 94 yards against Texas A&M in the 1977 Bluebonnet 
Bowl, and equaled by Zeph Lee in 1984 against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Charles Barkley on the state of professional sports: "I love 
football. It's the only game I can bet on right now. . . . I'm just kidding."

MUSIC REVIEW; GILFRY: A BOYISH DON GIOVANNI AT PAVILION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rodney Gilfry, the new Don Giovanni at the Music Center Opera, does almost 
everything right. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall, lithe and slender, he looks terrific. He is obviously intelligent, and 
he commands a bright, firm and flexible voice that wraps itself easily around 
the Mozartean cantilena. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an extraordinarily talented young man blessed with a real flair for 
the stage, a sophisticated sense of style and appealing vocal resources. 
Gilfry, moreover, is an artist who actually can exude charm without being arch 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 So why was "Don Giovanni" so frustrating Tuesday night when he took over the 
treacherous title role from Thomas Allen at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion? 
</P>
<P>
 The explanations are complex. Don Giovanni is a challenge that demands time 
and maturity as well as charisma. Two of the most celebrated 20th-Century 
paragons, Ezio Pinza and Cesare Siepi, achieved ultimate success only after 
numerous false starts, and after much stimulating work with demanding 
conductors and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilfry, who doesn't stalk and doesn't swagger, hasn't enjoyed much experience 
so far in the seducing fields of old Seville. And, unlike Pinza and Siepi, both 
dark-toned bassos, he is a light-toned baritone. He exudes gentle bonhomie in a 
part that traditionally demands sinister grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
 With more seasoning and better focused leadership, he might make a 
considerable mark on his own estimable terms -- within a properly intimate 
milieu. It should be remembered that the Pavilion, which seats 3,200, is 
virtually twice as big as most European houses. 
</P>
<P>
 At this juncture, Gilfry resembles a boy sent in to do a man's job. He is 
amiable, bright, eager, suave and a trifle smug -- an ideal Papageno, perhaps, 
trapped in the rong costume. His Don Giovanni is neither particularly 
aristocratic nor particularly sensual. Even so, Donna Elvira would have to be 
blind, and deaf too, to confuse him with the earthy big-bass Leporello of Paul 
Plishka. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is this nice college kid with the long ponytail doing as the dangerous 
protagonist of Mozart's dramma giocoso ? He's working hard. 
</P>
<P>
 There were moments Tuesday that pointed the way. Gilfry sang "La ci darem la 
mano" with a lovely, insinuating legato and, even better, mustered both a 
pretty pianissimo and elegant embellishment for "Deh vieni alla finestra." He 
never resorted to the predictable head-back-and-hands-on-hips postures and, 
apart from an over-used, all-purpose laugh, seldom resorted to expressive 
cliches. Perhaps this performance should be regarded as a down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the uneven cast was familiar. Elena Prokina, the vibrant 
Donna Anna, encountered pitch problems in ascending phrases. Joanna Kozlowska, 
the often exquisite Elvira, smudged some fioriture . Paula Rasmussen, the 
smoldering Zerlina, found the soprano tessitura something of a trial for her 
lovely mezzo-soprano. Thomas Randle's well-intentioned Don Ottavio lacked both 
grace and technical security. John Atkins as the wide-eyed Masetto and Louis 
Lebherz as the booming Commendatore represented the home team with enlightened 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone followed the hand-me-down outlines of Jonathan Miller's staging with 
urgent dedication, and Robert Israel's flexible expressionist decors continued 
to exert their fascination. This remains a thinking-person's "Don Giovanni." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Foster again conducted with sturdy, affectionate competence, 
stylistic inconsistencies notwithstanding.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISON: 'ER' VS. 'HOPE': WHICH MEDICINE IS EASIER TO 
SWALLOW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly buckling under its own tonnage, one series has a thick midsection of 
solemnity, its grave, self-important characters recalling the pretentious "man, 
woman, birth, death, infinity" line that opened the old ABC medical drama "Ben 
Casey." 
</P>
<P>
 The other series is younger, sleeker, brisker and more vigorous, a slashing 
roller blade. 
</P>
<P>
 So . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The fancy surgeons of the CBS series "Chicago Hope" had hardly scrubbed up 
when they were scrubbed from their 10 p.m. Thursday time slot opposite the 
overworked emergency room crew of NBC's new hit, "ER." 
</P>
<P>
 Swapping time slots with "Eye to Eye With Connie Chung," the redeployed 
"Chicago Hope" now airs at 9 p.m., facing NBC's epic "Seinfeld" and the new 
"Madman of the People." As they say before a risky transplant, lots of luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Given its coveted position capping a powerful NBC Thursday night lineup, "ER" 
figured to whip "Chicago Hope" in this Nielsen battle of new medical dramas set 
in Windy City hospitals, but perhaps not blow it away so incisively. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, despite their contrasts, the two series have some things in common 
besides Chicago and white lab coats. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have strong casts and characters with big hearts. (What medical series 
doesn't?) 
</P>
<P>
 As last week's episodes affirmed, both also express a reverence for life in 
ways uncommon for television by dwelling thoughtfully on the moment before 
zooming on. Aaron Shutt, the sensitive surgeon played by Adam Arkin, spent a 
chunk of "Chicago Hope" truly suffering over his loss of a patient. And on 
"ER," an intern lingered tenderly over the body of a young hit-and-run victim 
he thought he knew, so shaken that he initially notified the wrong parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Another common denominator is male-female stuff. On "Chicago Hope," sexual 
tension between white Mandy Patinkin's neurotic surgeon, Jeffrey Geiger, and a 
colleague played by black Victoria Dillard has intriguing racial overtones 
("The girl of my dreams has always been white and Jewish," he bluntly admitted 
to her last week). And Shutt's estranged wife, played by Roxanne Hart, is 
ever-present because of her job as a surgical nurse who frequently assists him 
in the operating room, even though their marital wounds still fester. 
</P>
<P>
 On "ER," George Clooney's high-libido pediatrician, Douglass Ross, is still 
attracted to an emergency room nurse with whom he had an affair. But when he 
dropped by late one night with flowers, another doctor answered the door, 
leading to a spat that found Ross getting rejected by his angry former lover. 
</P>
<P>
 Both series also value light moments, although not equally. With "Chicago 
Hope," the humor is an occasional eyedropper's worth, as when Geiger last week 
was arrested for solicitation after a frivolous come-on to a woman in a bar who 
turned out to be an undercover cop. 
</P>
<P>
 On "ER," the humor comes in streams. Take last week: While being examined, a 
patient rewarded the staff with a whoosh of flatulence. When a drug addict 
began humming a droning mantra, two doctors mocked him by humming harmony. The 
staff was mystified by an electronic wheelchair that periodically began 
spinning in circles, until learning it was activated by a patient's powerful 
cellular phone. And, finally, a middle-aged man was brought in still handcuffed 
to the woman (his wife's secretary) with whom he was having sex when stricken 
with an apparent heart attack. Then the wife arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their similarities, however, the differences separating "Chicago 
Hope" and "ER" run much deeper -- which surely accounts in part for why "ER" is 
so much more popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicago Hope" has a smaller core cast than "ER," which has so many characters 
that you may spend the season sorting them out. But the blur of faces creates 
its own energy and excitement. Someone on "ER" -- it doesn't matter who -- is 
always being awakened from a dead sleep to try to save someone's life. In 
contrast, "Chicago Hope" at times is itself the dead sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the more visceral "ER," they're always stepping on it. Accurate or not, 
this is medicine on the run, with patients being processed like Big Macs. On 
"Chicago Hope," Geiger does all the running (like a laboratory rat on a wheel) 
in a series that seems at times to crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 "ER" does take occasional pit stops to allow its characters to contemplate 
themselves and their environment. But "ER" doesn't think a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicago Hope" thinks too much, fancying itself as some kind of cerebral TV 
laboratory. Everything on this series is a big deal, utterly cataclysmic. On 
"ER," a defibrillator misfires. On "Chicago Hope," patients misfire, to the 
extent that even routine surgical procedures are diverted around hairpin 
curves. It turned out, for example, that a lovable old guy who needed to be 
relieved of his gall bladder (the same man who previously had a brain tumor 
removed) was a racist, insisting on a Jewish surgeon rather than the "colored" 
one assigned to do his operation. "Get me a Jew!" the non-Jewish patient 
demanded. Shutt chewed him out, then was chewed out for chewing him out by the 
hospital's compassionate but stern surgical chief, played by Hector Elizondo. 
Shutt thought about it, then made up with the racist, who got his Jew. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallowing in misery, it's the melancholy Geiger who epitomizes the heaviness 
of "Chicago Hope." Now you take Eriq La Salle's interesting young doctor, Peter 
Benton, the character with the most edge on "ER." He has a chip on his 
shoulder, no doubt about it, last week clashing with a colleague competing with 
him to become chief surgical resident. But it's only a chip. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, if Geiger had any more weight on his sagging shoulders, they'd 
collide with his elbows. One week he separates Siamese twins, the next he 
rushes a dead patient's lifesaving heart to a dying patient, the next he 
performs a radical baboon heart transplant. On top of that, his wife is in a 
mental institution, having murdered their young son. Because he's played by 
gifted musical star Patinkin, Geiger always manages to find time at the end of 
each episode to sing just a little. Sadly, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 So, it comes down to this. For actual medical care, you'd prefer the doctors 
of "Chicago Hope." You'd prefer to watch the doctors of "ER."

 White House Sculpture: First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton inaugurated a White 
House sculpture garden featuring works of 20th-Century American artists 
including Alexander Calder, Louise Bourgeois, Ellsworth Kelly and Louise 
Nevelson. The works, on loan from Midwestern museums including the Art 
Institute of Chicago and Minneapolis' Walker Art Center, will be on exhibit in 
the White House's Jacqueline Kennedy Garden through January. On Tuesday, 
Hillary Clinton introduced the dozen loaned sculptures to an audience of 
artists and museum directors, saying she hoped the collection would spawn 
future exhibitions from other museums.

 Record Tissot Price: An anonymous buyer paid a record price of nearly $5.3 
million on Wednesday in New York for a painting by 19th-Century French artist 
James Jacques Joseph Tissot. The painting, "Garden Bench," is considered to be 
the artist's finest work and was estimated by Sotheby's auction house to bring 
$1.5 million to $2.5 million. The previous record for a Tissot painting was 
$2.97 million, set in 1993.

 Art for the Future: Noted American artist Robert Rauschenberg has created 21 
limited edition artworks dealing with global peace, social justice and 
environmental concerns as part of Tribute 21, his new art program aiming to 
improve conditions for the 21st Century. The editions will be sold worldwide to 
fund future Tribute 21 programs, and 21 sets will be donated to museums and 
other institutions. As a centerpiece of the program, 21 individuals "whose 
lifetime contributions will greatly impact and positively affect" the next 
century will be honored at Rauschenberg's New York studio on Friday. Among the 
honorees: filmmaker Steven Spielberg, performance artist Rachel Rosenthal, 
communications mogul Ted Turner, art collector Dominique de Menil, the Dalai 
Lama, and statesmen Al Gore, Mikhail Gorbachev and Nelson Mandela. Honored 
posthumously will be actress Audrey Hepburn, composer John Cage and Muppets

 Theatrical Complaints: The Burbage Theatre in West Los Angeles has been 
removed from Actors' Equity's list of sanctioned producers. Equity official 
Michael Van Duzer said actors alleged "filthy" conditions, non-payment of a 
stage manager, "frequent appearances" of rats (including an "impromptu entrance 
onstage opening night") and violations of Equity rules. Burbage producer Ivan 
Spiegel said the problems have been corrected. He contends the charges were 
brought because he closed a show early after a dispute with an actor; however, 
he must go through an appeals process for reinstatement to the union list. Of 
the six shows currently at the Burbage, the Equity decision could force the 
closure of only "Race" and "Bumps in the Night." The other shows are either 
produced independently of Spiegel or are solo shows that operate under 
different rules. POP/ROCK

CLUB REVIEW; A HAVEN FOR ROMANTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're in the mood for amor, Club Love is the ideal aphrodisiac. Although 
the new venture, which takes place at the Burgundy Room on the first and third 
Saturday of each month, is in the heart of Hollywood, it's not for the whips 
'n' chains crowd.Featuring the sweetest, sexiest soul music from the early 
'70s, Club Love is a haven for hopeless romantics who swoon to each song as if 
it's spinning just for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Selecting tracks from the pre-funk, pre-rap era, deejay Victor Rodriguez takes 
many of his listeners back to their junior high school dances. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the old days, when you quaked in fear that the pimple-faced geek 
across the room might ask you to dance to the extended version of Earth Wind & 
Fire's "Reasons," when the track comes on at Club Love everyone simply grooves 
on it together. 
</P>
<P>
 With an inordinate number of songs including the L-word in the title -- 
Atlantic Starr's "When Love Calls," Enchantment's "Silly Love Song" and the 
Isleys' "At Best You Are Love" are just a few examples -- the club couldn't be 
more aptly named. A microphone is even set up to allow clubgoers to make 
dedications, which is one reason Rodriguez maintains a deep collection of 
passionate faves from such artists as the Stylistics, the Isley Brothers and 
the Dramatics. 
</P>
<P>
 * Club Love at the Burgundy Room, 1621 1/2 Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood. Every 
first and third Saturday. 21 and over, no cover. (213) 465-7530. HEIDI SIEGMUND

MUSIC REVIEW; JOHNSON IN CLARINET RECITAL AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These days, a clarinet recital might seem a fairly rickety entertainment 
vehicle -- there's nothing too sexy about the idea, that's for sure. But in 
opening the new season of the Gold Medal series at Ambassador Auditorium Monday 
night, clarinetist Emma Johnson appeared bent on proving how wrong such 
impressions are. 
</P>
<P>
 The charismatic young English musician -- already a prolific recording artist 
-- offered an interesting and accessible, mostly 20th-Century program, a lively 
stage presence, engaging spoken comments on the music and a performing persona 
both intimately and forcefully communicative. 
</P>
<P>
 In Schumann's "Phantasie-stucke," she went right to the heart of its lyricism, 
shaping alluring, ethereal and dappled phrases as need be. To John Ireland's 
1943 Fantasy-Sonata and Poulenc's 1962 Sonata she brought a volatility of 
expression, searing and vehement one moment, breakable and intimate the next. 
She captured the sweet melancholy of the central movement of the Poulenc 
perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 Her account of Beethoven's Variations on "La ci darem la mano," on the other 
hand, sounded showy, an application of an arsenal of shadings, colors and 
stretchings on a straightforward piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Two works from 1985 written especially for Johnson -- Michael Berkeley's 
unaccompanied "Flighting," upward cascades of sound depicting the soul leaving 
the body, and John Dankworth's "Suite for Emma," an attractively melodic 
jazz/classical mix -- finished off the printed program, in fluent and 
compelling readings. 
</P>
<P>
 Her accompanist, Malcolm Martineau, proved a sensitive supporter.TIMOTHY

MOVIE REVIEW; 'IVAN': EAST EUROPEAN JEWS IN THE 1930S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a time of madness, with every aspect of society, from the personal to 
the political, veering toward collapse. Mystics, racists, pragmatists, 
idealists and young people in love collide on the 1930s streets of the nameless 
town on the eastern Polish frontier that is the setting for an impressive new 
work called "Ivan and Abraham." 
</P>
<P>
 The first fiction film by French documentarian Yolande Zauberman, "Ivan and 
Abraham" is ambitious in all its aspects. An attempt to re-create the lost 
world of Eastern European Jewry between the two World Wars, it is a 
well-crafted document that captures the chaotic spirit of the times with a 
Brueghl-like texture and density. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensitively photographed (by Jean-Marc Fabre) in wide-screen black and white, 
"Ivan" is more than anything a visual pleasure. Shot in small villages in 
Belarus and the Ukraine, it uncannily brings to life the crowded courtyards, 
the winding paths and byways, the cluttered study houses that characterized 
life in the long-gone shtetls of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer-director Zauberman, whose parents were Polish Jews who survived the 
war, has also laced the visuals with a moodiness that emphasizes the melancholy 
that cut across all aspects of society, as the apocalypse that no one could 
name but everyone felt hovered just out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ivan and Abraham" tells its story through a single family. The grandfather, 
the pious but rigid Nachman (Roland Bykov), has trouble managing the estates of 
the area's dissipated prince (Oleg Iankovski), but worrying him just as much 
are two problem grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel (Maria Lipkina) is a marriageable teen-ager, but she is terribly in 
love with a man her family considers unsuitable, the renegade Communist Aaron 
(Vladimir Machkov), who is on the run from the authorities but returns to the 
town because Rachel is on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel's 9-year-old brother Abraham (Roma Alexandrovitch) is just as much of a 
trial to Nachman. Too wild to be considered an acceptable Jewish child, he 
would rather ride horses than pray and spends most of his time with his best 
friend, the older, non-Jewish Ivan (Sacha Iakovlev), who has been apprenticed 
to Abraham's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Overlaying all of this is the wariness with which Jews and non-Jews regard 
each other. The local peasantry both hate the Jews and are frightened of them, 
their superstitiousness making them ready to scapegoat any outsiders. So when 
the reckless prince loses everything to gambling debts, he sets a whirlwind 
into motion that soon sweeps up Aaron and Rachel, Abraham and Ivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned with verisimilitude, writer-director Zauberman went to some lengths 
to make everything feel right. Since most of the film's dialogue is in Yiddish, 
she had her non-Jewish cast learn the language from scratch, and, helped by a 
tutor who was a student of the great Soviet Yiddish actor Solomon Mikhoels, 
they do a surprisingly good job speaking it, as well as the Russian, Polish and 
Gypsy languages that add to the babble of tongues. 
</P>
<P>
 In her eagerness, Zauberman does allow some of the film's dramatic scenes to 
drift into awkwardness, and the overall pacing is not unexpectedly slow. But 
standing in strong compensation is the way "Ivan and Abraham" conveys a sense 
of silent witness to this seething world, half-medieval, half-modern, that was 
soon to be no more.

ART REVIEW; SELF-INDULGENCE SAVED BY BRITTLE CLARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Pierson makes no grandiose claims for his art. It is literally 
self-effacing -- full of smudged marks, half-erased texts and fragile images 
that seem to be hiding.Yet it's also relentless, insinuating itself into your 
consciousness in the manner of only the most passive-aggressive of 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 In new pencil drawings at Regen Projects, Pierson's stock repertory of images 
and tropes appears: faded roses and twinkling stars, bruised egos and failed 
love affairs, regrets and passions so ordinary they are tawdry. Without the 
irony, or the torpid self-parody that marks the work of many of his 
contemporaries, Pierson makes a spectacle of intimacy. His art enacts -- among 
other melodramas -- the artist's struggle to maintain a romantic temperament in 
an age that is contentedly degenerate. 
</P>
<P>
 What saves Pierson from the limbo of self-indulgence is his brittle clarity. A 
tiny clump of palm trees and the words "Everything you wanted," for example, 
propose a Hollywood-style fantasy of fulfillment. Yet the partially rubbed-out 
accusation "Didn't I give you . . . " -- hovering in the background like an 
unwanted lover -- transforms the drawing into a lucid narrative about the 
inevitable corruption of romance.  
</P>
<P>
 The most recent piece in the show is a huge still-life that depicts the 
biography of actress Jean Seberg (who played St. Joan, married a French 
intellectual, and committed suicide) propped up against a vase of red roses. 
Although seeming from a distance to be a color photograph, the image is, in 
fact, a painting on canvas, produced with a computer program. From a distance, 
the allegorical tableau is slightly blurred; up close, it vanishes entirely, 
lost in a field of multicolored dots. How appropriate for Pierson -- to recast 
an aesthetic innovation into a slow-motion dissolve into infinite, undisturbed 
bliss.

 Restaurants these days all seem to seek the cutting edge. Not Pangaea of 
Beverly Hills. This eatery was named for the hypothetical single landmass that 
split apart 
</P>
<P>
 200 million years ago to form the present-day continents. 
</P>
<P>
 Pangaea has a modern side too, taking first place in the 1994 National 
Restaurant Assn.'s "great menu contest" over 700 other U.S. and Canadian 
restaurants in a carte to carte battle for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Its winning entry featured dried raffia leaves and depictions of primitive 
cave drawings, which successfully replicated, according to the contest judges, 
the restaurant's multiethnic culinary theme. 
</P>
<P>
 The upscale restaurant will receive no monetary reward but will enjoy "honor 
and distinction," said a spokeswoman for the National Restaurant Assn., which 
has held the annual competition for more than three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 So even though it didn't make millions, Pangaea learned what Spielberg surely 
knows: Prehistoric pays.

 AVIAN A.P.B.: If you hear a bird whistling Beethoven, Nancy Lee Lamb wants to 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb, a Santa Monica College student, has lost her pet, Buster, a foot-tall 
4-year-old Nape Amazon parrot that was a fixture in the Santa Monica College 
music department. 
</P>
<P>
 The bird, which has bright-green feathers and splashes of yellow on his head, 
has been missing since Sept. 1; Lamb suspects he was stolen. She has posted 
notices in which she offers a $5,000 reward. 
</P>
<P>
 Buster has far more than Beethoven in his repertoire, Lamb says. He says 
"Hello," "Buster is a bad bird," "Here kitty, kitty," "Meow" and more. He can 
cry, Lamb says, "like a newborn baby" and can do wolf whistles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb asks anyone with information on Buster's whereabouts to call (310) 
572-4122.

 ITS HONOR: Pat, the sexually ambiguous character on TV's "Saturday Night 
Live," is about to gain a vast new constituency: the city of West Hollywood.

 On Monday, the West Hollywood City Council plans to name Pat honorary mayor so 
he -- or is it she? -- can preside over the city's Halloween Carnaval, a Mardi 
Gras-style celebration scheduled for Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the wall? 
</P>
<P>
 Not really. Pat is not a complete stranger to the corridors of power. The 
actress who plays Pat, Julia Sweeney, is the sister of Jim Sweeney, deputy to 
West Hollywood Councilman Sal Guarriello.

 ROMANTIC HEIGHTS: Why isn't this surprising? 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Monica flying business is now offering "mile-high adventures" in which 
a couple can rent a twin-engine plane featuring a feather bed, king-size 
pillows, champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries in a cabin "securely 
partitioned off from the cockpit." 
</P>
<P>
 When the plane reaches 5,280 feet, a news release from Santa Monica Air Tours 
says, the pilot rocks the wings "to let the couple know they have reached that 
'golden' altitude." 
</P>
<P>
 The price, like the flights, is high: $279 per couple for an hour in the air. 
But, hey, whatever it takes to get a relationship off the ground.

HISTORIC HILLVIEW IN DANGER; OWNERS MAY DEMOLISH DAMAGED HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT 
HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the elderly tenants at the Hillview Apartments have lived or worked in 
the landmark building long enough to remember when trolley cars rattled past on 
Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic Hillview, at Hudson Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard, could soon go 
the way of the streetcars, leaving a couple of dozen low-income senior citizens 
hunting for a new home. 
</P>
<P>
 The southernmost third of the pink stucco, Mediterranean Revival building was 
red-tagged by the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety after the Jan. 
17 earthquake. The rest of the building is considered safe. 
</P>
<P>
 But building owners say that recent damage caused by Metro Rail subway 
construction along Hollywood Boulevard may result in the demolition of the 
apartment house, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places 
and was built by movie mogul Jesse Lasky in 1917 for movie actors. 
</P>
<P>
 An MTA spokesman said a cursory inspection by a private structural engineer 
found no damage directly related to subway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 However, about 12 tenants have been living in a local hotel since mid-August 
when gas service was interrupted as a result, according to the Hillview's 
owners, of Metro Rail construction. Last week, one of the owners told the 
remaining 10 or so tenants to move out within 20 days, ostensibly to prepare 
the way for demolition, a move that has drawn opposition from Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it's so badly damaged, we can't afford to fix it," said D. V. 
Hanneken, one of the building's owners. "There's not enough income from rentals 
to run it." 
</P>
<P>
 Leif Hetland, representative of a trust that owns half of the Hillview, 
confirmed that he and the other owners are seriously considering demolition and 
are also planning to file a claim against the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority for unspecified damages from subway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Hetland said that the owners have not yet applied for a demolition permit from 
the city. Because of the building's historic status, the proposed demolition 
would be subject to an environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg, who hopes to save the building, is objecting to the landlord's 
action on grounds that the city's rent control ordinance requires a 30-day 
notice and $5,000 relocation subsidies to elderly tenants in the event of 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have an elderly person who's been in an apartment for a long period 
of time, evicting them is tantamount to a death sentence," said Rod Field, a 
lawyer at the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, which is advising tenants. 
"You're taking them out of their world, a place where their family is each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Field and others said the tenants would probably have a hard time finding 
other affordable housing in Hollywood. Rents at the Hillview start as low as 
$375 for a single apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 For 21 years, Margaret Vargo has lived alone in a small, second-floor 
apartment at the Hillview. The 80-year-old retired bookkeeper said she has no 
plans to leave, even though she's packed a few of her belongings just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cool here in the summer, and nice and quiet, at least when the windows 
are closed," she said one evening this week. "Some of the old things should be 
preserved, shouldn't they?" 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, Carter Wright, 83, boxed up cables, lights, movie posters and 
furniture collected during his 47 years as a talent agent and vocal coach with 
an office in the Hillview. A visitor arrived just as movers were trundling his 
upright piano to a new office down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like leaving my home," Wright said, pulling off his brown fedora. "This 
street had everything: streetcars, lovely trees. My gosh, I could tell you 
enough nostalgia for you to go boohoo." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hillview Apartments were originally intended as housing for movie actors, 
who were viewed as undesirable tenants by many Hollywood landowners early this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs in the windows of some area boardinghouses read, "No actors, no dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the January temblor, preservationists have lost battles to save 
several historic buildings in Hollywood, including the Brown Derby on Vine 
Street and the Hastings Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard.

WOMAN AWARDED $120,000 IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE; LAW: SUPERVISOR MADE UNWANTED 
ADVANCES TO D.A. INVESTIGATOR, JURY FINDS. BUT TWO OTHER CLAIMS ARE REJECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA PALERMO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury has awarded $120,000 to an investigator for the Santa 
Monica branch of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, finding the 
woman was sexually harassed by her supervisor.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the jury rejected investigator Virginia Harper's claims of sex and 
race discrimination and retaliation by the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict, announced last week, falls short of the more than $1.2 million 
Harper demanded in the lawsuit, filed in April, 1993, against the district 
attorney's office and supervisor Henry Grayson, who remains supervisor of the 
investigators in Santa Monica. After the award was announced, attorneys on 
Tuesday reached an undisclosed settlement covering legal fees and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel vindicated. It's a huge relief," said Santa Monica attorney Peggy 
Garrity, who represented Harper. "It's not about money; it's about empowerment. 
Virginia just wanted her voice to be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, 46, an investigator for 20 years, left her $70,000-a-year job on 
medical leave in November, 1992, claiming harassment by Grayson caused her to 
be transferred from Santa Monica to the district attorney's downtown office and 
subjected her to emotional distress and alienation from her co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 After four weeks of testimony, the jury voted 11 to 1 that Grayson, 48, a 
22-year veteran of the investigations unit, had sexually harassed Harper and 
treated her with malice and oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 But the panel, after deliberating a week, rejected, in a 9-3 vote, Harper's 
claims of retaliation by the office and could not agree on whether she had been 
the victim of racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, an African American, claimed she was denied supervisory positions 
despite positive performance reviews and the fact that she had often served as 
acting supervisor in the Santa Monica branch office.  
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, which began Aug. 31, the defense portrayed Harper as an 
employee who resented her supervisor's efforts to increase her productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a question of who you believe," said Deputy County Counsel Dennis M. 
Gonzales, who defended Grayson and the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have known Mr. Grayson for about 100 hours, and I feel very strongly that 
none of the allegations are true. The jury made its determination based on the 
approximately two hours it heard her story and Mr. Grayson's story. I believe 
the jury was not in a position to see what he's really like," Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, the first female and one of the few African American investigators for 
the county, accused Grayson, who is also African American, of touching her 
inappropriately and pressuring her to go to lunch with him alone. 
</P>
<P>
 After she resisted his advances, Harper said, Grayson became hostile, 
punishing her with unwanted assignments and threatening her status in the 
office.

 When Harper submitted her complaints in writing in August, 1992, the office 
conducted an investigation and concluded the allegations were unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "This verdict proves the county's investigation was a sham," attorney Garrity 
said. "The county had much more information than we did, but they elected to 
ignore her, because she's a woman and a black woman." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very disappointed in the system I worked in for so long," Harper said. 
"But I feel vindicated in that the jury saw the truth."

'96 PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY WILL FORCE CITIES TO SHUFFLE ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Like hundreds of municipalities throughout California, Westside cities are 
faced with rescheduling their elections to make way for the 1996 presidential 
primary. And that could mean incumbent city officials will have to cut short 
their terms in office or extend them by up to 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict, which could give seated city council members terms of almost 
five years, arose when the state Legislature changed the California 
presidential primary date from June, 1996, to March 26, 1996, to give the state 
more leverage in the presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But the revised date causes a conflict with municipal elections scheduled for 
April 9, 1996, according to the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder. The 
county has said it will be too busy with the primary to provide the cities with 
the usual support services for municipal elections, such as ballot boxes, 
street indexes and signature checks for absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 When it changed the date of the presidential primary, the Legislature 
stipulated municipal elections could be rescheduled as long as no term of 
office was changed by more than 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Beverly Hills, West Hollywood and Malibu, all of which use the 
county's election services, have indicated that they will probably follow the 
majority of California cities and change Election Day to March 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills and West Hollywood city councils were scheduled to take up 
the matter next week; Malibu had not yet put the issue on the council agenda. 
Santa Monica avoids rescheduling since it holds municipal elections in 
November. Culver City's charter stipulates that it can only change the election 
date by a public vote.

 There are a lot of secrets on the Westside, and one of the biggest has been 
The Colleagues outlet store for new and worn designer clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. They've moved to the Bergamot Station complex in Santa Monica -- 
the hip new area dominated by art galleries off Cloverfield Boulevard, near the 
Santa Monica Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 In this case, "they" are the most well-heeled, well-groomed saleswomen you'll 
ever hear say, "Can I take those things or are you still trying some on?" Their 
letterhead lists 65 names all designated by "Mrs." -- as in Mrs. Ronald Reagan 
and Mrs. Armand Deutsch. Sitting at the cashier counter could be the wife of a 
Reagan Kitchen Cabinet member. As she takes your money and packs your 
acquisitions into a brown paper bag, she might comment on your good taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, you may have just bought the gown she wore to the inaugural ball. And 
it's all for a worthy cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The first sale open to the public was staged in 1959 in the ballroom of a 
mansion in Bel-Air, with receipts of $700. The Colleagues, though, have been 
around for 44 years. From their inception, they supported women and children, 
first by donating funds to the Big Sister League, which operated homes for 
unwed mothers and then, in the '70s, to the Children's Institute International. 
The institute supplies care and shelter to children who suffer from severe 
abuse. The Colleagues' first donation of $1 million helped establish one of the 
nation's first therapeutic day-care centers for infants and toddlers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've all made shopping mistakes," says Lupe Hinckle (Mrs. William), "and 
that's how this whole thing started. A group of Colleagues were meeting and 
trying to decide how to raise money and someone suggested that we bring all of 
our 'dogs' to the next meeting and sell them to each other. Well, we did and we 
fought over each other's mistakes -- that's the genesis." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, shoppers at The Colleagues outlet can find Adolfo-suits, Anne Klein 
coats, Alan Austin silk blouses and Chanel dresses hanging on the racks. 
Evening gowns, probably worn once and costing thousands of dollars, can be had 
for a few hundred. 
</P>
<P>
 There are shoes, belts, handbags, hats and cases filled with costume jewelry. 
You might even find a signed Miriam Haskell piece. There is also a designated 
area for men's wear, antiques and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some clothing, including donations by the likes of Fred Hayman, Jimmy Galanos, 
Bill Blass and David Hayes, is new. And the prices -- $33 for a silk blouse, 
$54 for a coat (the buttons were worth more when it was originally sold) and 
$10 for a wool sweater -- are so reasonable that there's almost a fever pitch 
of shopping adrenalin in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The vortex is the community dressing room, where strangers pass judgment on 
one another's outfits. On a recent visit, a yellow dress was passed around so 
that everyone had a shot at it. It made its way back to the rack in the 
manicured hands of the wife of one of L.A.'s most successful businessmen. 
Sorry, no names please. 
</P>
<P>
 Midge Clark (Mrs. Frank W., Jr.) came from Santa Barbara to be part of opening 
day at Bergamot. She pitched in by tagging donations, some of which come from 
as far away as Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once a Colleague always a Colleague. We are unforgiving of people who don't 
do work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She's not allowed to say which millionaire movie mogul's furniture just 
arrived or which musical comedy star's tap shoes, trunks, hats and Western 
boots are up for sale.  
</P>
<P>
 "We like to protect our donors and our members who wish privacy," says 
co-chair Marion Hall (Mrs. Lemuel), "and since we can't afford to advertise, we 
rely on word of mouth and good faith to get quality merchandise."  
</P>
<P>
 The Colleagues is located at Bergamot Station, 2525 Michigan Ave., Santa 
Monica. Mondays noon to 2 p.m., Thursdays 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. (310) 828-1619. 
Donations are appreciated.

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; BUTTERFLY SAFETY NET; EXPIRATION OF A $430,000 GRANT 
WORRIES VOLUNTEERS WORKING TO RESTORE THE DUNES NEAR LAX WHERE THE EL SEGUNDO 
BLUE FLOURISHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They stride across the dunes like foot soldiers in some ecological army, 
sporting T-shirts emblazoned with a single blue butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stoop to do battle with the alien ice plant and brushy acacia trees that 
threaten the El Segundo dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Others kneel in the sand to plant native shrubs that vanished from this 
seaside kingdom long before many members of this volunteer gardening army were 
born. 
</P>
<P>
 What has brought these volunteers here, weekend after weekend, is a heartfelt 
vision that time can be rolled back and the dunes restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mission is to rebuild an ecosystem that vanished a generation ago as 
urban Los Angeles pressed toward the sea. They operate by a simple but delicate 
equation: banishing the ice plant and other non-native species while nurturing 
coast buckwheat, the El Segundo blue butterfly that feeds on it and a myriad of 
other plants and insects that once called the dunes home. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's icon is the El Segundo blue, a federal endangered species whose 
primary home is this fragile snippet of dune-scape wedged between sprawling Los 
Angeles International Airport and the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the ice plant is nearly vanquished. The butterfly is flourishing, up 
from 400 10 years ago to more than 10,000 today. But on this misty October 
morning, what should have been a celebratory event -- a salute to a job nearly 
finished -- takes on a somber cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggering concern is the Oct. 7 end of the $430,000 grant that financed 
restoration work under the direction of Rudi Mattoni of Beverly Hills, who has 
received national attention for his fight to save the El Segundo blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, no one knows for sure how the dunes will be protected in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who looks after these plants that we've just planted?" asks a frustrated 
Mattoni. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Segundo dunes is at a crossroads. When the grant expired last week, 
responsibility for the area moved from the city Department of Environmental 
Affairs to the city Department of Airports, which owns the dunes.  
</P>
<P>
 The juxtaposition is a curious one: LAX, the nation's third-busiest airport, 
high-tech launching pad for hundreds of jumbo jets each @day, is charged with 
protecting the habitat of a fluttering thumbnail-size butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an airport official promises to "do the right thing by the dunes," 
some environmentalists are nervous that a mammoth agency accustomed to dealing 
with high-powered airlines and fast-flying machines may not fully grasp the 
importance of buckwheat and insects. After Mattoni began studying the dunes for 
the Department of Airports in 1984, he discovered that it contained 28 plants 
and animals that are native to the Southern California dunes system.  
</P>
<P>
 But years of development and soil contamination helped foster non-native 
species, he reported, threatening the survival of native wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 As departing jets screech overhead on this overcast Sunday, Mattoni and his 
supporters issue a rallying cry to about 60 people gathered at the dunes for 
the last scheduled volunteer cleanup-and-planting effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work is not done," said Jon Earl, director of Rhapsody in Green, a Los 
Angeles environmental group that has championed the dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the volunteers weed and plant, Mattoni, 66, stands slightly apart, ear 
protectors cupped around his neck, observing the activity with deep blue eyes 
that nearly match the blue of the butterfly imprinted on his T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 In a playful moment, he disappears under a tattered, turquoise-colored tarp 
until his head re-emerges through a hole in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as giggling teen-agers watch, he slowly flaps his tarp-covered arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweet butterfly . . ." he sings under his breath. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni's life has been intrinsically tied to blue butterflies -- the El 
Segundo blue he has helped preserve at the dunes, the Palos Verdes blue 
butterfly he rediscovered in San Pedro this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the butterfly is simply a metaphor, he says, of the complex native 
ecosystem that is slowly taking root again. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni, a UCLA visiting lecturer in geography and environmental science, 
talks passionately of the dunes' other crown jewels, the 11 species of plants 
and animals that can be found only on this narrow strip of sand: the El Segundo 
goat moth, the El Segundo Jerusalem cricket, the Lange's dunes weevil, the El 
Segundo spineflower, the El Segundo crab spider. 
</P>
<P>
 He sounds astonished that others might not notice the mysteries to be found 
here. It is baffling to him that Angelenos can be obsessed with saving the 
Amazon rain forest -- even reporting the acres lost on a lighted digital 
monitor outside the Beverly Center's Hard Rock Cafe -- while they ignore the 
home-grown wonders just west of LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni found his first blue butterfly 50 years ago mounted in a cardboard box 
at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, he was a schoolboy fascinated by butterflies, collecting them, 
puzzling over the colors of caterpillars that clung to the bush outside his 
bedroom window in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as a teen-ager during World War II, he visited the dunes for the first 
time and witnessed the butterfly alive. The airport was tiny then, and only a 
few houses perched on the dunes. He remembers flocks of butterflies and huge 
expanses of coastal buckwheat. 
</P>
<P>
 He left Los Angeles to study entomology at UC Berkeley, returning to earn his 
Ph.D. at UCLA in population genetics. 
</P>
<P>
 His resume portrays him as a Renaissance man of science, assessing the effects 
of the first atomic explosion on native insect populations in New Mexico, 
conducting studies on astronauts' personal hygiene in space. 
</P>
<P>
 A company he founded produced millions of cotton pink bollworm moths -- so 
named because of their bright pink larvae -- that were sterilized with 
radiation and used to control the bollworm attacking the San Joaquin Valley 
cotton crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is not a professional entomologist, he kept returning to 
butterflies -- especially blue butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1984, he returned to the dunes, charged with studying how blue 
butterflies and other native insects remained. 
</P>
<P>
 The dunes had changed dramatically since he last saw them. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the dunes' coastal buckwheat was probably destroyed when homes were 
built. Ice plant, which was popular among developers who used it to stabilize 
sand, can squeeze out the remaining buckwheat and other native species.  
</P>
<P>
 "The ice plant was all over the place. It was ghastly," he recalls. To worsen 
matters, after constructing Pershing Drive on the dunes' east side in the 
1970s, the city had planted the wrong kind of buckwheat, Mattoni said. Instead 
of coast buckwheat -- the sole food of the El Segundo butterfly -- workers had 
planted common buckwheat, throwing the ecosystem out of sync.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the most startling changes of all was not on the dunes, but above them. 
As many as 900 to 1,000 low-flying jets roar above the butterflies each day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was the burgeoning growth of LAX that created the dunes 
preserve and thus enhanced the El Segundo blue's hopes for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Once houses and streets covered the very dunes the butterfly inhabits. But the 
rise in jet traffic in the early 1960s forced the removal of almost 800 homes 
under the noisy takeoff routes, baring the dunes again. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the preserve exudes an eerie sense of in-between. 
</P>
<P>
 Remnants of the old neighborhood remain, like ruins of some Roman village. 
</P>
<P>
 Cracked concrete streets run like frayed ribbon through the dunes, weeds 
sprouting through the cracks. Street numbers are barely visible on decaying 
curbs. A peeling yellow fire hydrant sits next to one dune, and brick steps 
lead nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most of the area has returned to wilderness, a soothing tapestry of 
brown-gray shrubs against tan sand. Then, a dune away, LAX comes into view, its 
terminals and control towers spread across the horizon like a space age 
metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 This juxtaposition of sand and city, nature and technology endows the 
restore-the-dunes project with much of its drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300-acre area is the last large remnant of a series of dunes systems that 
once ran from Point Conception north of Santa Barbara to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials had long planned to use about 200 acres of the cleared dunes 
to build a seaside golf course, with the remaining 100 acres set aside as a 
preserve. But then the California Coastal Commission questioned how the 
development would affect the El Segundo blue butterfly.  
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter helped spearhead a 1990 city agreement under 
which 200 acres were designated a preserve, with 100 acres to the north set 
aside for the golf course. Activity shifted to restoring the dunes, although 
airport officials say that a golf course is still possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni and his colleagues have been working to restore the dunes, most 
recently with the $430,000 grant from the state Resources Agency and a $75,000 
grant from the Coastal Conservancy. The work was overseen by the city 
Department of Environmental Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has spawned a small but intensely loyal band of defenders. 
Hundreds of volunteers, including UCLA professors and Westside schoolchildren, 
regularly visit with trowels and gardening gloves.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the Department of Airports shoulders responsibility for the dunes, 
trepidation is apparent among some dunes defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to assure those people that we're not going to turn our backs on the 
work they've done," Phil Depoian, Department of Airports deputy executive 
director, promised last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mattoni says the airport has promised only that he can volunteer at the 
dunes for an additional 30 days. He has no idea if he will be allowed on the 
site after that time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter has written airport officials to urge them to plan for long-term 
maintenance. She said last week that she is "reasonably optimistic" that the 
airport can be persuaded to arrange for that maintenance, which she estimates 
would cost about $45,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmental groups have banded together to form the Coastal Dunes 
Conservancy, hoping to provide management and scientific expertise for 
preserving the dunes, said Fred Heath, president of the Los Angeles Audubon 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Department of Airports, Depoian said last week that he does not know 
enough about the conservancy plan to say if it is feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, environmentalists hope the airport will continue to allow the 
hands-on volunteer work that they say has been key to the restoration's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It surprises me that I feel this way about this pile of sand," Heath said. 
"There's something very different about pulling out weeds and planting plants, 
a rush that I've never gotten from saving a piece of land by political means." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the dunes restoration project wound down Friday, Mattoni stacked nursery 
pots from the El Segundo project into his faded Volvo station wagon and drove 
them across the South Bay to a little-known military fuel depot in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, during a routine biological survey in March, Mattoni and fellow 
researchers found the Palos Verdes blue butterfly, believed to have been 
extinct for a decade. The area had never before been surveyed for butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its distant El Segundo cousin, the Palos Verdes blue is classified as an 
endangered species, and only about 200 were estimated to be living last spring 
at the U.S. Navy's Defense Fuel Supply Point near Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Mattoni has his way, those numbers will grow. He hopes to restore the 
area much as he has the LAX dunes, re-vegetating it with native plants such as 
the locoweed upon which the Palos Verdes blue feeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The politics of a fuel-depot restoration may prove simpler than the dunes 
project. The land is owned by the U.S. Navy, which Mattoni says has supported 
his efforts so far. The depot is a park-like area, with 26 tanks below ground 
and only three aboveground, posing little interference for the butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palos Verdes blue is a relatively unknown butterfly compared with the El 
Segundo blue. It apparently vanished from the Palos Verdes Peninsula in the 
early 1980s, after most of its breeding sites were destroyed by housing 
development, fire control and the expansion of a city park.  
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni's natural ebullience surfaces as he talks of planting locoweed for the 
butterfly to feed on. He begins ticking off the other key native plants for the 
fuel-depot ecosystem: California sagebrush, black sage, bush sunflower. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like the dunes," he explained. "By doing what you can do to save 
the butterfly, you're going to augment the whole community, and therefore 
everything will benefit. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll go from one rebirth to another."

OUT AND ABOUT / PHOTO EXHIBIT: PIECES OF A PUZZLE COME TOGETHER

 The third time will be the charm for Nancy Goss. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time her works were scheduled to go on display at Santa Monica 
College, the curator of the Photo Gallery was fired and the show was postponed. 
The second time, the Northridge earthquake hit and damage to SMC caused another 
delay. Starting Monday, the exhibit, titled "Nancy Goss Photo Montages," is 
scheduled to finally open, continuing through Nov. 10 in the Photo Gallery in 
the foyer of the SMC Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Goss presents an unusual exhibit that contains 15 works. Most are 6 feet by 7 
feet and are unframed, making them "earthquake friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 Using a technique that combines photography and images of statues, living 
figures, animals and nature, Goss creates art that is distinctive and 
thought-provoking. To create photo montages, she uses black-and-white film to 
shoot various images before making prints on lithofilm paper. Then she decides 
what type of image to create. 
</P>
<P>
 Working from her studio in a renovated barn in North Hills, she puts the 
pieces of the puzzle together and uses a special paint to seal and protect her 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most enjoyable (part) is building (the montages)," she said. "It's like a 
puzzle until it's done." 
</P>
<P>
 Goss, who grew up in Carbondale, Ill., developed an interest in art as a 
child. She holds a bachelor of fine arts degree from the University of New 
Mexico and a master's degree from UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hills artist said that, when younger, she was frequently influenced 
by other artists' work. Over the years, she has worked to develop her own 
style. Goss believes her inspiration comes from within or from sources close to 
home, such as friends, music, books and dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a lot of feelings from dreams, (from) which I try to extract a kernel 
of meaning that can be translated into a static visual image," she said. "In 
return, images from my work find their way into my dreams, so that they both 
end up influencing each other." 
</P>

COMMUNITY: IN DEFENSE OF COUNCIL HOPEFUL BARBARA YAROSLAVSKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a person who has worked with Barbara Yaroslavsky on many different projects 
over the years, I can tell you firsthand of her inexhaustible energy when it 
comes to giving to the community. In no way is she anyone's puppet ("Police 
Union Pledges Support for D'Agostino in Council Race," Oct. 9).Her willingness 
to help or give time is her gift to you, no matter how big or small the 
request. In a city where people are preoccupied with their own needs and gains, 
you find in Barbara a person who genuinely and honestly cares. Her knowledge of 
current and pertinent issues that affect this community are a major priority 
with her. After all, that is really the most important issue, to care and work 
hard for the community we all share.

AGING: GETTING THE WORD OUT ON UCLA CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to convey our great pleasure and appreciation for the Sept. 4 "For 
Seniors" feature ("Bridges Wins Hands Down for 'Living Better Longer' "). This 
article described the UCLA Center on Aging's Sept. 27 program, "Eating to Live 
Better Longer," and included an interview with Lloyd Bridges.(In a recent 
conversation with me, Mr. Bridges also expressed his delight with the article 
and how much he enjoyed speaking to the L.A. Times staff people who came to his 
home.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you ever wonder who reads this feature, we can attest to the fact that it 
has an enormous audience. Our programs have been attracting audiences of 
between 90 and 130 people and being naturally optimistic we have been booking a 
facility on the UCLA campus that has a capacity of 150. As a result of Ms. 
Feldman's article, we have received well over 150 inquiries and paid 
registrations for the meeting now stand at 245. We are delighted to report that 
we have had to change the site of the meeting to accommodate this large 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 One of our primary missions is to educate the public in issues relevant to 
aging, and we are grateful to you for your help.

 FULLER UP 
</P>
<P>
 College basketball teams begin practice Saturday, signaling the start of the 
Tony Fuller era at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller, who replaced Tom Asbury as coach, will conduct his first practice at 1 
p.m. at Firestone Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do a lot of conditioning and play a couple pickup games," 
Fuller said. "I'm really excited to get a chance to work with my team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves, however, will be without 6-foot-11 center Gavin Vanderputten and 
7-1 center Jamar Holcomb. Vanderputten underwent arthroscopic surgery on his 
right knee three weeks ago and Holcomb broke a knuckle on his left hand. 
Vanderputten is expected to miss a week of practice and Holcomb will be out six 
to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller says he has a young team and will not expect too much too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be a lot of teaching and a lot repetition," Fuller said. "I 
don't want them to try and get into midseason form by the first week of 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller has been busy scheduling tournaments for future seasons. The Waves will 
compete in tournaments at New Mexico and Nebraska in 1995, at Syracuse and 
Arizona State in 1996 and at Brigham Young University in 1997. RECRUITING TRAIL 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Jager, a prized basketball prospect from Vista High of San Diego, lists 
Pepperdine as one of his semifinalists, according to his coach, Kevin 
Barbarick. 
</P>
<P>
 Jager, a 6-foot-6 forward, averaged 23 points, eight rebounds and four assists 
and was selected to the all-state team by Cal-Hi Sports magazine. He is also a 
two-time selection to the All-San Diego County team and participated in the 
Adidas ABCD national basketball camp in Teaneck, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Jager also is considering Ohio University, Oregon State and Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
 The early signing period begins Nov. 9. GAME OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City can take pride in the fact that it was the only high school 
football team to beat Mira Costa last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centaurs defeated the 1993 Division VII champions, 21-20, when Mira Costa 
running back Phil Fonua fumbled during the closing minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only loss for Mira Costa under Coach Don Morrow, who has a 17-1 
record in two seasons. The two teams meet Friday at Mira Costa in a game that 
could determine the Ocean League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "They like to pound the ball down your throat," Culver City Coach Robert Moore 
said. "They have bigger players than we do and they like to play smash-mouth 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Mustangs beat Beverly Hills, 27-7. Mira Costa had 297 rushing 
yards, including 164 yards and two touchdowns from standout running back Mike 
Fikes. Aki Wilson rushed for 157 yards and two touchdowns as Culver City beat 
Morningside, 30-18. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their biggest weakness is that they can't pass," Moore said. "We just hope 
they fall behind and have to worry about the clock." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs will be without Fonua and Dino Rossi, two All-Southern Section 
Division VII all-stars. Fonua, a preseason All-American nose tackle, suffered a 
ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Rossi, a receiver and defensive back, had surgery 
to repair a torn knee ligament. SPECIAL K

<P>
 Kiff Kimber has been selected men's and women's swimming coach at Santa Monica 
College, Athletic Director Avie Bridges said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimber has been the Corsair women's swimming coach the past two seasons and 
worked with men's coach Stu Blumkin. Kimber and Blumkin were hired as part-time 
coaches in 1992 when longtime men's and women's coach John Joseph retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges said the school made a decision to combine both programs under one 
part-time coach in the spring because of budgetary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimber, Blumkin and two other candidates were interviewed for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased to have Kiff," Bridges said. "We feel she has done an excellent 
job in the past and we're looking forward to her directing both programs to a 
new level and new era." 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to arriving at Santa Monica, Kimber was the head men's and women's 
swimming and diving coach at El Camino College from 1983-88. She was a physical 
education instructor at UC San Diego in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimber, who has a master's degree from Long Beach State, is currently a 
part-time physical education instructor at Santa Monica and East Los Angeles 
colleges. QUOTEBOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Yarnall, a longtime St. Bernard baseball coach who was pressed into 
service as a football coach, talked about the difference between coaching the 
two sports: "In baseball, you pat them on the back. In football, you kick them 
in the rear. In football, you watch game films to try and find your opponents' 
weaknesses and then exploit them. In baseball, you try to find your weakness 
and hide him in right field. Baseball is a thinking man's sport. Football is a 
rah-rah sport.". . . .

THEATER; AT HOME IN THIS 'BERG; PLAYWRIGHT CECILIA FANNON PREPARES FOR A WORLD 
PREMIERE IN HER OWN BACK YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Edition staff.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mariners have long reported green icebergs in northern waters, but scientists 
for years re garded the sightings as illusory, perhaps a trick of reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 They were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Green icebergs exist," Cecilia Fannon said. "In fact, they are . . . a very 
brilliant, emerald green. And, they're very rare." 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach resident, interviewed last week, was explaining the metaphor 
behind the title of her new play, "Green Icebergs," which starts a week of 
previews Friday on SCR's Mainstage before its world premiere Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Some icebergs absorb plankton and other marine life. The accumulating weight 
can actually change an iceberg's balance and tilt it, exposing the green that 
was below the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't happen to all icebergs -- they say one in 100, maybe one in 200," 
Fannon said, adding that the process mirrors what happens to the two couples in 
her play. "They undergo this -- well, I guess we could call it a sea change -- 
and in a way are capsized and their lives are turned upside-down." 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon's own life, if it hasn't been turned quite upside-down, has undergone a 
sea change of its own in recent months. After writing five full-length plays in 
five years without a production, the sixth has gone from birth to boards in 
less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 That process has involved seven drafts, two full readings and, now, all the 
last-minute trims and changes that come during the rehearsal process for a new 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful. It's overwhelming sometimes," Fannon said in an interview in 
the theater's lobby. "It even impresses me that this whole lavish production 
stems from something on a written page." 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon was a free-lance technical writer 10 years ago when she moved to 
Newport Beach, and soon thereafter found some success in writing for 
television. Other aspects of her writing career, however, have required more 
patience. Two novels generated interest among publishers but remain 
unpublished; a major production company has contacted her about a screenplay 
she wrote, but she has seen no option money yet. Now, after previous plays 
performed well in competition, one is actually being produced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 10 years ago, I expected to be a produced screenwriter (immediately). 
. . . Absolutely, I would have thought, I deserve this," Fannon said. "Ten 
years later, I feel, 'Wow, this is really cool,' because now I can actually 
enjoy it, and it's less a matter of deserving." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At an afternoon rehearsal for "Green Icebergs," 10 days before the previews, 
Fannon watched intently, with one hand supporting her chin, and a script open 
before her. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the third week of rehearsals," said the director, David Emmes, 
during a brief break, adding that the actors are "just coming off the book" -- 
meaning they can go through the scenes without their scripts.  
</P>
<P>
 Fannon is on hand to clarify any aspect of the script that may seem murky to 
the actors, and to smooth the play's edges with a line change here and there 
when necessary. Scenes may be revised all the way through previews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just last weekend I took off, because I think there comes a time when you 
have to back off," Fannon said after the rehearsal. "I absented myself, and the 
end result was when I got home Sunday . . . there were 12 calls on the machine. 
So, I guess they were not weaned." 
</P>
<P>
 For world premieres, SCR usually brings in a playwright for the first and the 
final weeks of rehearsal. But because Fannon lives nearby, she has not only 
been available all through rehearsal, but has also through the long development 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was an added benefit to have Cecilia in the neighborhood, if you 
will," Emmes said in a separate interview. "That was certainly helpful, to be 
able to meet from time to time and talk. It's been a very positive process, 
just to see the play continue to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 For the actors, as well, having the playwright on hand is an added resource.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoy it. Because they're there, they can help clear things up," 
said Nike Doukas, who plays Veronica, a writer and one of five main characters 
in in the play. "When you're working on a play that's been done 15 times or 115 
times or 1,015 times, you tend to just accept that this is the way it's done 
and you work through it. . . . When you know it's the first time, there are 
things that might not quite work or need some smoothing out." 
</P>
<P>
 Robb Curtis-Brown, who plays Claude (another of the leads), agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what I like about new plays, actually, is that they're still flexible. 
It's still in motion," said Curtis-Brown, who also performed in Richard 
Greenberg's "Night and Her Stars," another SCR premiere last year. "It's 
actually working really wonderfully. Cecilia has a real strong sense of what 
she wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Doukas: "She's really easygoing and very receptive. I get the sense from 
her that's she's enjoying hearing her play spoken by actors. I've always felt 
that playwrights get a charge seeing their words come off the page." 
</P>
<P>
 The admiration is a two-way street. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel comfortable with me and I with them," Fannon said, "so we have a 
camaraderie, which doesn't always exist. It can't always be that way for 
reasons of distance. For reasons, also I think, of distance between writer and 
actors." 
</P>
<P>
 The play was written quickly, even if the subsequent development has been a 
more measured process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the middle of writing another play, and I was sitting in the bathtub 
one night and I thought, wow, this would make a really good play. I wrote it 
last November and December, in short order." 
</P>
<P>
 She submitted it to SCR's California Playwrights Contest, in which she had 
placed second the year before for "To Distraction." "I thought I would sneak it 
into the contest, thinking this is ridiculous, because I had won (second place) 
the year before. I thought there's no chance they're going to listen to me, the 
Newport housewife." 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon was in Hawaii for an annual family gathering when told she had won 
first prize. It was at this same number that SCR had called her the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what happens when you let something go, thinking 'no chance,' " 
Fannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 It went on to a staged reading in April, and at the end of a debriefing a week 
later, "David (Emmes) said that they'd like to produce the play. And I said 
absolutely not, I want this straight to Broadway," Fannon said, laughing. "From 
there, I just sort of sailed home and made the announcement to my husband." 
</P>
<P>
 In the play, two Orange County couples meet by chance in a small Italian hill 
town, and their lives become intertwined in ways that turn the old 
relationships upside-down. In the second act, which takes place 18 months 
later, they reconvene in the same town in an attempt at "closure" that only 
leads to more fireworks. An Italian waiter oversees the action, spouting 
quotations that comment on the conflicts and contretemps. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmes said the play was "essentially there" at the reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly I was very attracted to the intelligence and the wit that was 
manifest. . . . Also, as a director, it was something that I just had a 
response to. It spoke to me on a creative sort of level, if you will. I could 
see a production, I could see it working on stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent changes mostly helped to clarify the action, Fannon said, and did 
not change the substance of the play.  
</P>
<P>
 "You know what I think? After all of this tremendous amount of work . . . I 
think that most people who came to see the reading will not notice that the 
play has changed. Unless I'm terribly mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier crack about "Newport housewife" is a little self-deprecating 
humor, one of many joking asides Fannon might offer during the course of a 
conversation. The New York native, who is married but has no children, is a 
woman whose far-flung interests turn up in her written works in sometimes 
surprising ways. 
</P>
<P>
 She has written a screenplay on the remarkable lives of Russian modernist poet 
Osip Emil'evich Mandel'stahm and his wife Nadezdha Yakovlevna Mandel'stahm -- 
esoteric and non-commercial subject matter for a Hollywood film, it would seem, 
yet she reports that Castlerock Entertainment has shown some interest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the plot twists of "Green Icebergs," which is set in a fictional hill town 
in Italy's Tuscany region, the Renaissance monk and painter Fra Fillipo Lippi 
plays a pivotal role, although not as a flesh-and-blood character. Fannon is 
now contemplating a play based on the life of another figure from Italian 
history, St. Ursula, who -- as legend has it -- was slain along with 11,000 of 
her female followers for turning down the advances of the Huns. 
</P>
<P>
 At the University of Utah, Fannon studied a variety of subjects, including 
dance and languages -- Russian, Greek, Latin, French, Spanish and Italian, to 
be precise. Then there was her stint as the only student of an imposing 
professor emeritus of Yiddish, Louis Zucker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were people who entered (the program), and they were so browbeaten by 
this very intimidating gent they all left," Fannon said. "I studied with him 
for two years, and I was his only student, an Irish Catholic from Queens 
studying with Louis Zucker, and it was one of the great experiences of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was sometimes so hard, that I would go home in tears. . . . I learned out 
of fear, which is still a very effective teaching method. Don't underestimate 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Zucker died in 1981 at age 83. 
</P>
<P>
 "At his memorial service, one person came up and (told) a story to the effect 
that he never gave any student an A except for me," Fannon recalled. "It was 
the crowning achievement of my life, and it came at someone's memorial 
service." 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a lesson from those days that she still carries with her, it has 
to do with the precision with which he chose his words: "He always chose the 
right word -- always -- and he cautioned me to choose the right word." 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon came out West making her living as a technical writer, but instead she 
found success writing for TV soap operas. Then, just as she was about to change 
networks, the writers' strike hit in 1989. She decided to take a playwriting 
class at UC Irvine, taught by SCR literary manager John Glore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to say that I can take absolutely no credit for her success as a 
playwright," Glore joked in a telephone interview. He said he has had many 
students, but he recalls that Fannon showed a talent for playwriting early. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once she started, she didn't stop," Glore said. "That gives you some sense of 
how serious she became. . . . She does have kind of quirky view and a great 
comic sense, a lightness of touch and a seriousness of bearing that combine 
wonderfully in her work. Mostly it's the kind of thing we look for in a writer, 
and that is a distinctive point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 Glore and Fannon became friends while she was still a student. 
</P>
<P>
 "As her teacher and friend, I couldn't really advocate for her work at SCR as 
I would have otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the contests, however, Fannon eventually made her mark, culminating in 
the coming premiere of "Green Icebergs." 
</P>
<P>
 For the premiere, she will be receiving visitors, family and friends, from as 
far away as Spain and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll be here when the reviews come out, so they can get the gurney and the 
Valium drip," Fannon said, her lighter side coming through again.

TO SING FROM CHILD'S POINT OF VIEW

 You never know what's going to motivate kids. One day, they'll get all charged 
up by a handful of milk caps. Another day, they think they need a second trust 
deed to wipe their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to a lot of parents, the mother of children's pop singers Janet and 
Judy got off cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom's our mentor; she's really musical, and she loved to hear us sing when we 
were kids," explained Janet, the older of the thirtysomething twins by six 
minutes. (The sisters prefer to use only their first names. "We're like Madonna 
and Cher," they quip.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom had a deal with us. After dinner she'd say, 'If you practice, then I'll 
clean up the kitchen,' " Janet continued, laughing. "To this day, I can't stand 
cleaning the kitchen, but I'm always happy to practice." 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement with their mom, a music teacher, didn't just save them from 
dishpan hands. With hits like "P.A.R.T.Y." and "M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i" 
receiving heavy air play on the nationally syndicated Radio Aahs and a loyal 
audience garnered from years of school and public performances, the sisters are 
firmly entrenched in the children's entertainment field. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, backed by a country trio called the Hotbilly Boys, Janet and Judy 
kick off Brea's new Kids Culture Club series, a five-show season of family 
music and entertainment sponsored by Radio Aahs. (The season continues through 
April with performances by the Happy Crowd, J. P. Nightingale, Jim Gamble 
Puppets and Caren Glasser in the Curtis Theatre. Subscription tickets are 
available.) 
</P>
<P>
 Though well known in some circles, the sisters -- who have performed 
professionally since 1970 -- haven't achieved the household name status Raffi, 
Joanie Bartels or Craig 'n Co. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't do national tours (preferring to stay close to their San Fernando 
Valley homes), and they don't record on a big label. And, unless they're out 
together, they're rarely hounded for autographs in the supermarket. Which is 
the way they like it. "When we first started, we were doing adult-oriented 
music, and we were performing for kids in schools, too," Judy recalled. "We'd 
get home from a day of school shows, go out and play a club, then get home at 1 
in the morning and start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, they decided to concentrate on children's music, a move that 
helped them professionally and personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," Janet said, "we work 'normal people' hours and make a living as singers 
and songwriters, which is pretty amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 The twins still spend a lot of time in school. They'll be in Huntington Beach, 
Westminster, Garden Grove and Anaheim elementary schools the week of Oct. 24 -- 
performing shows with such themes as geography, fitness and earth science. 
</P>
<P>
 The shows are liberally sprinkled with comedy, with the sisters portraying 
characters ranging from a ditsy Valley girl to Jane Fondue to Nutritia, a 
105-year-old fitness freak. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair have released six albums, two of them winners of Parents Choice Gold 
Seal Awards, and a seventh is due out by Christmas. They produce and market 
their own recordings, selling their tapes at their concerts and operating a 
mail-order business from their Burbank office.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, the sisters have added family concerts to their school 
repertoire. With bass player/comedian Ritt Henn, they developed "Janet and Judy 
-- Trio," a folksy music and comedy act inspired by the early Smothers Brothers 
routines.  
</P>
<P>
 When they play with the Hotbilly Boys, they switch to a high-energy country 
sound, mixing Western swing, rockabilly, Cajun and bluegrass -- styles picked 
up from an old Canadian fiddle player when the family vacationed summers on a 
rural island off Ontario when the twins were growing up.  
</P>
<P>
 With Henn, the sisters taped their first concert video this summer at San Juan 
Capistrano's Coach House, attracting a standing-room crowd of 500 children and 
adults. They plan to release that tape this Christmas, about the same time the 
two videos they've made for the World Pog Federation will come out. Producers 
hope the videos will translate into a Saturday morning television show for the 
duo. (And, yes, Judy and Janet have their own line of Pogs.) 
</P>
<P>
 Graduates of the University of Illinois, Urbana, in music education (Janet 
studied violin, Judy classical guitar), the performers have played together 
since they were 5. At 18, they were co-directing their minister-father's church 
choir. A few years later, they moved to California and started doing their 
school shows with help of their older sister, Kathy Lucey, a Laguna Hills music 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet and Judy write most of their songs. "One person gets an idea and writes 
it," Janet said. "The other person rewrites it, then we scream and pull each 
others' hair out and eventually come up with something good."  
</P>
<P>
 And whether the musical style is pop, country or rock, they say their lyrics 
are always written from a child's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always try to hone in on what kids love . . . being a couch potato, going 
to birthday parties, that kind of thing," Judy explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Janet: "The (songs) do have messages, but we're not bonging (kids) over 
the head with them. We don't expect kids to go away saying, 'Oh, wasn't that 
thought-provoking?' But we do hope we can influence them in a positive way and 
help them have some fun."

 Boz Scaggs 
</P>
<P>
 "Middle Man" (1980) 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia  
</P>
<P>
 Even though it spawned two Top 20 hits -- "Breakdown Dead Ahead," which got to 
No. 15, and "Jojo," which got to 17 -- "Middle Man" wasn't quite the smash its 
predecessor was: "Silk Degrees," a few years earlier, had included "Lido 
Shuffle" and "Lowdown," which got to Nos. 11 and 3 respectively. Still, when it 
comes to funky rockers and silky, blue-eyed soul, "Middle Man" is nothing to 
sneeze at."Jojo" is propelled by snappy horn accents, a thumping bass groove 
and Scaggs' sensual voice, the unstoppable "Breakdown" by hard-charging rhythm 
and some near-metal guitar runs. Scaggs, who'd started out along the 
Texas/Oklahoma border in the mid-'60s as a gritty blues- rock disciple, hadn't 
cranked up his amps this loud in years. 
</P>
<P>
 The slower songs on "Middle Man" extend the smooth, attractive balladry of 
"Silk Degrees." Though a bit melodramatic, "You Can Have Me Anytime" can sweep 
you off your feet with its lush production and Carlos Santana's cutting guitar 
solo. "Simone" is more energetic and no less appealing: A classy string 
arrangement and some cool vocal work by Scaggs and a back-up trio add to its 
uptown sparkle. 
</P>
<P>
 Scaggs would not be heard from again for eight years. The '80s just weren't 
meant for a man who'd helped define the upscale pop/dance sound of the 
mid-'70s. But today "Middle Man" remains fresh and inviting. JON MATSUMOTO

EVENTS; A MARKET FOR FIESTAS; MARIACHI APPEARANCES ARE PART OF A MONTHLONG 
LATINO ALTERNATIVE TO GERMAN CELEBRATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Gabriel Zavala can relate to Stu Sutcliffe. Like the ill-fated "fifth Beatle," 
Zavala once left a rock band before its big success. Only Zavala's band was in 
Mexico, not Liverpool. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main difference between Zavala and Sutcliffe is that Kismet ultimately 
led Zavala to a contented life in Mariachi music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mariachi is the essence, the soul of the Mexican people," Zavala said. "When 
you hear it, something stirs inside you." 
</P>
<P>
 Zavala and his 21-year-old son, Oliver, headline Los Amigos Mariachis, which 
will take the stage all this month at Fullerton Market, held every Thursday 
through Dec. 15 on Wilshire Avenue between Harbor Boulevard and Pomona Avenue 
in Fullerton. The mariachi band's appearance is part of "Octoberfiesta," a 
Latino alternative to the more well-known German-flavored Oktoberfest 
celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Los Amigos Mariachis (who play between 5:30 and 9 p.m.), the 
admission-free outdoor market offers fresh produce, arts and crafts, children's 
activities and other entertainment from 4 to 9 p.m. Also tonight at 7, 
Fullerton High School students will perform Latin American dances. Next 
Thursday, the children's dance troupe Xochitlpitzahuatl will present Mexican 
folk dances. Fanfarryas Colombyana will perform Colombian folk dances the 
following Thursday. (See accompanying schedule for Fullerton Market 
entertainment in November and December.) 
</P>
<P>
 Octoberfiesta reflects Fullerton officials' desire to celebrate Latino 
culture. Latinos, who contribute significantly to Fullerton's artistic life and 
lend civic and community leadership, make up roughly one-fifth of the city, 
leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 Zavala, an Anaheim resident who performs throughout Orange County, was raised 
on mariachi music in Acambaro, a small town northwest of Mexico City. He first 
took lessons at age 12 from the eldest of his six brothers, all of whom still 
make music. 
</P>
<P>
 He made his debut in a community band, then picked up the guitar and joined 
the Rocking Devils, the group that hit the big time (releasing at least 10 
albums), after he departed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, I was very poor," Zavala, 49, said in a recent phone interview from 
his home, "and I needed to buy a nice electric guitar and amplifier. So, I came 
to the U.S. to make some money." 
</P>
<P>
 He planned to buy the instrument and rejoin the Devils. But, while in America, 
Zavala became disenchanted with the '60s rock scene, which he described as rife 
with illicit drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when all the bad things started to happen with the acid and LSD," he 
said, "and the music went real, real crazy, psychedelic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a nice clean hometown boy, I didn't go into drugs, and I didn't like 
rock anymore. I didn't see myself performing with long hair and love beads. So, 
I picked up my old acoustic guitar and started strumming the old familiar 
(mariachi) folk tunes. From there, my brothers, who had also moved here, and I 
decided to do something together." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Hermanos Zavala (the Zavala Brothers) performed throughout Southern 
California for a decade. It disbanded in the mid-'80s when the younger siblings 
split off to play rock, but Zavala has kept his family tradition alive with his 
father-son-led octet, which is now 5 years old. None of the other members are 
related to Zavala. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started teaching Oliver notes on the accordion when he was about 6," Zavala 
said, "then moved him to the guitar. Now he is working toward his bachelor's 
degree in music at Fullerton College. He wants to score for film." 
</P>
<P>
 Five of Los Amigos Mariachi's members will appear at the Fullerton Market. 
Gabriel plays the violin, arranges and writes many of the group's tunes. Oliver 
plays trumpet and guitar. Their program will include spicy jalicience, the 
fast, staccato trumpet rhythm most identified with mariachi, waltz-like 
rancheras, romantic bolero ballads, and cumbia, the danceable, upbeat music of 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of such non-mariachi styles as cumbia and rock pop Espanol -- 
the rage among young Latinos that's making mainstream inroads too -- doesn't 
worry Zavala. He believes that mariachi, more closely "connected to the Mexican 
psyche" than any other music, has lasting power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We enjoy a nice salsa , a nice cumbia and cabraditas ," he said, "but when 
people hear mariachi, they go 'Eeeeeeaaaahh!' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the events going on at the Fullerton Market, there are other 
ways to celebrate Latino culture in that city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Museum Center is exhibiting a Day of the Dead ofrenda (altar) at 
301 N. Pomona Ave., and waives admission from 6 to 8 p.m. on Thursdays through 
Dec. 15. This Saturday at 6:30 p.m. (and every weekend in October), the museum 
center will screen the video "La Ofrenda: The Days of the Dead," and 
Xochitlpitzahuatl will dance at 8 p.m. Admission to the video screening is 
$2.50; admission to both is $8. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Los Amigos Mariachis perform between 5:30 and 9 p.m. during 
Octoberfiesta at Fullerton Market. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Fullerton Market runs Thursdays through Dec. 15 from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Wilshire Avenue, between Harbor Boulevard and Pomona Avenue, 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Orange (57) Freeway to Chapman Avenue, Fullerton exit; go west; 
turn left onto Pomona to Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 738-6575. More at the Market 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Octoberfiesta ends, there will be plenty going on at Fullerton 
Market. The following events will take place in November and December, held 
every Thursday through Dec. 15 from 4 to 9 p.m. at the Market: 
</P>

BEER IS MAJOR IN MICRO ECONOMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For beer lovers who want to get out of town this weekend, the first Pacific 
Coast Beerfest is being held in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 micro-breweries, including the Huntington Beach Beer Co., will offer 
about 120 beers from California, the Pacific Northwest and other parts of the 
country from noon to 6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at the Earl Warren Showgrounds, 
Las Positas Avenue and Highway 101. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get across that fine micro-brewed beer is really no different 
than fine premium wine," said Greg Turk, president of the GT Group, the 
organization managing the festival. "Once you have tried a premium beer, it's 
hard to go back to the mass-produced American beers that we grew up with." 
</P>
<P>
 Other participants include the Boston Beer Co., Solana Beach Brewery, 
Manhattan Beach Brewery and Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival also will feature three cooking-with-beer demonstrations, a 
presentation on "The Art of Brewing Microbrewery Beer" by Walter Scheurle, 
associate brewmaster for Samuel Adams, two live bands and food. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission each day is $15 ($5 for designated drivers), and tasting is $1 per 
three-ounce sample. A souvenir glass and program will be included with 
admission. 
</P>

WANNA DANCE?: YOUNG PROFESSIONALS CAN FLIRT TO THE MAX -- OR JUST A LITTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 For many young up-and-comers in the corporate culture, there is nothing better 
than being able to mix business with pleasure in a club setting.  
</P>
<P>
 Can you relate? 
</P>
<P>
 If so, FLIRT (Fun Loving Individuals Relating Together) is your ticket on 
Friday nights at Club Max, in Costa Mesa's Red Lion Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, local suits are wooed after work with happy-hour parties in their honor. 
Patrons fill out an entry form for the chance to win, among other things, 
accommodations in a reserved area, special drink prices and a free appetizer 
for the winner and up to 50 of his or her closest associates and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis here -- not just during happy-hour parties, but all night -- is 
on networking. Flyers make a point of telling you that "Young Professionals 
meet here," as though it were akin to a Young Republicans meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ads also emphasize that this club is not pretentious, but there is little need 
for pretense. FLIRT at Club Max is a nice club with nice people; it's not a 
source of trendy fashions or trendy music. Deejay Evan Landes simply spins a 
mighty mix of old school, disco, hip-hop, dance and pop. And within that 
format, he's much better than those at other "cool" clubs slinging the same 
hash. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, between Landes and promoter Patrick Chic's good-looking flyers, Club 
Max seems to compete with some of the more "in" nightspots. But the patrons 
here aren't young fad hounds, they're just interested in getting (a little) 
loose.  
</P>
<P>
 There are five pool tables and a blackjack table where players compete for 
fun, not money. 
</P>
<P>
 Club Max amuses fans on other nights with Acid Jazz on Tuesdays -- not so much 
a night to highlight this musical genre as to relate a '90s Bohemia, complete 
with herbal teas and poetry readings, and Hot Country Night on Wednesdays; 
deejay Landes returns Thursdays for Danceteria, a night of house, hip-hop and 
retro; and Saturdays is club Fever with '70s and '80s retro, disco, soul and 
Top 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy hour is from 5 to 8 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, with $2 drafts, $2.50 
daily cocktail specials and $1 appetizers. Regularly, cocktails are $3.50 to 
$4.25 ($1 more for doubles); a glass of wine runs $4 to $4.75; soda and 
flavored mineral waters are $1.95; premium bottled beers such as Samuel Adams, 
Becks, Coors Oktoberfest Beer and Fosters are $3.25, and domestic beers are $3 
a bottle, $2.75 for draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen stays open until 11 serving up a list of mostly fried and messy, 
tasty appetizers such as mozzarella sticks ($3.25), nachos ($4.50) and hot 
wings ($3.95). 
</P>
<P>

MUSIC/DANCE; 'GENDER' SPECIFIC; BORN OF RAP, CHOREOGRAPHER GERSTLER'S LATEST 
WORK DEALS WITH SELF-RESPECT FOR WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Chris Pasles covers classical music and dance for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Choreographer Tina Gerstler found her most recent inspiration in a rap song. 
"I was listening to the a cappella African American group Sweet Honey in the 
Rock," Gerstler says. "They were singing about women being a priority in 
society, being upheld and acknowledged as what they can be. That got me 
thinking about how to project that onto the stage." 
</P>
<P>
 The result is Gerstler's new "The Translated Gender," which will receive its 
premiere performances by Ballet Pacifica this weekend at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-minute work (one of four pieces on the program) has a cast of 13 women, 
no men. "It's a women's piece," Gerstler says. "There are sections, but it's 
not delineated sectionally. It begins with a trio of solos that are interwoven, 
with three women who represent icons of what society presents as being 
feminine. 
</P>
<P>
 "One woman is in jeans, who looks like a Calvin Klein or a Guess jeans girl, 
smokes a cigarette and looks like 'hard chick.' That sort of hard-edged but 
feminine image has become very prevalent in ads and fashion magazines and 
billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another soloist is wearing a Chanel-type of evening gown, like a cocktail 
evening hostess. The other soloist is more romantic, dressed in a sort of a 
flowy thing. Initially, she was the only person I put on point, but because the 
movement is modern, putting it on point lost its fluidity. So I put her back in 
ballet slippers." 
</P>
<P>
 After the trio, a wider perspective of women in various roles comes into play. 
"So the piece is basically dealing with where society is at this point in 
time," she says. "This is about the width and breadth of what women can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it has to deal with self-respect, and having gained more personal 
self-respect, I wish society's images would help to build that. Images are 
limiting, and we don't need any more limitations than have been set on us in 
the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerstler has worked with Ballet Pacifica twice before, creating "Personal 
Statement -- Common Knowledge" in 1992 through a commission from the company, 
and "Better Unsaid," set to a score by Brad Dutz, in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Like those efforts, the new dance is a collaboration, this time among 
Gerstler, artist Megan Williams, Dutz and lighting designer Liz Stillwell. 
</P>
<P>
 The set, for instance, is "built during the piece," Gerstler says. "There are 
three 9-by-7-foot hanging set pieces, divided into three panels for each piece. 
Each panel is three feet tall and can be interwoven. They make up three more 
ideas of woman. . . . They're mixed up at first, then changed so that you 
actually see the (original) paintings in their entirety by the end of the 
piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutz's score for this dance incorporates women's voices, including a recording 
of his girlfriend, who is Japanese, reading "Japanese want ads for women, which 
are very specific about physicality." 
</P>
<P>
 A collaboration, Gerstler says, "can get intensely wild. Part of this 
challenge is to take all these other elements into consideration and still be 
visually interesting instead of overwhelming. But I don't think this piece is 
heavy. Parts of it are funny. I hope parts of it are funny and entertaining as 
well as thought-provoking." 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Ballet Pacifica dances Tina Gerstler's new "The Translated Gender." 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Friday, Oct. 14, at 8 p.m.; and Saturday, Oct. 15, at 2:30 and 8 p.m.

POP; DAVE EDMUNDS PLUGS IN TO HIS MUSICAL INFLUENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Mike Boehm covers pop music for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a wonderful, semi-autobiographical novel called "A Fan's Notes," the late 
Frederick Exley wrote about a man who finds respite from his own considerable 
flaws and troubles by following the storybook career of football great Frank 
Gifford with obsessive fervor. 
</P>
<P>
 If you wanted to sum up the career of Welsh rocker Dave Edmunds, who plays the 
Coach House on Wednesday, "A Fan's Notes" would be as apt a title as any. While 
Exley's alter ego could only fantasize about Gifford's life and root from afar, 
Edmunds has been able to spend 25 years or so walking in his musical idols' 
shoes -- and sometimes helping them to take creative steps of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 An ace guitarist, a strong, fluent singer and a studio rat well-versed in the 
art of rock record-making, Edmunds, 50, has used his wide-ranging skills to pay 
frequent homage to the music that inspires him. 
</P>
<P>
 He first captured American ears in 1970 with a boisterous hit cover of the 
Smiley Lewis R&B song "I Hear You Knockin.' " Since then, partly because he 
isn't a prolific songwriter, Edmunds has often culled choice nuggets from the 
roots-rock and R&B traditions and given them his own treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The range of his interests comes across in "The Dave Edmunds Anthology 
(1968-1990)," a two-disc compilation issued last year by Rhino Records. Some of 
the earliest cuts, with the band Love Sculpture, find him immersed in the 
psychedelic pop of the "Magical Mystery Tour"-era Beatles, or doing guitar 
rave-ups on classical sources in a way inspired by keyboard whiz Keith 
Emerson's first band, the Nice. But Edmunds' first full album was straight 
blues -- a style he chose not out of any particular affection for it, according 
to the Rhino compilation's liner notes, but because his record company viewed 
blues as a hot commodity in Britain. From the recorded evidence on the Edmunds 
anthology, he was an amazingly quick study. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, a blend of country music, rockabilly and Chuck 
Berry-inspired rock 'n' roll has been at the core of Edmunds' craft. Some of 
his best work came in the late '70s and early '80s, when he partnered with 
Rockpile, the roots-loving band that also included Nick Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmunds has often been able to pass on his musical affections in a way helpful 
to others. His ear for harmony was clearly shaped by the Everly Brothers -- and 
Edmunds the fan was able to repay his mentors by producing the Everlys' 
much-lauded, mid-'80s comeback albums "EB '84" and "Born Yesterday." As a fan 
of rockabilly music, he helped revive interest in the form during the early 
1980s, producing the Stray Cats' signature hits. Edmunds' production credits 
also include the Fabulous Thunderbirds' commercial breakthrough album, "Tuff 
Enuff"; "Party of One," a likable but overlooked 1990 effort by his old buddy, 
Lowe; and k.d. lang's 1987 major label debut, "Angel With a Lariat." 
</P>
<P>
 On his new album, "Plugged In," Edmunds continues to dash off his fan's notes, 
paying tribute to rockin' and twangin' country music with a cover of "The 
Claw," by Jerry Reed, and putting his own layered-guitar spin on Otis Redding's 
soul music chestnut, "I Got the Will." The novelty song "Beach Boy Blood (In My 
Veins)" finds him multitracking his own voice until it's possible to believe 
that Edmunds has Wilsonian vocal cords. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plugged In" is a do-it-yourself effort that he worked up at his home studio 
in Los Angeles, using digital drums and playing all the other instruments. On 
stage, Edmunds will have the help of guitarist Bobby Bandier, bassist John 
Regan and drummer Jamie Oldacker. 
</P>
<P>
 * Who: Dave Edmunds. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Wednesday, Oct. 19, at 8 p.m. With Kevin Gilbert. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (5) Freeway to the San Juan Creek Road exit 
and turn left onto Camino Capistrano. The Coach House is in the Esplanade 
Plaza. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 496-8930. MORE POP: 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Sahm isn't along for the ride this time, but the three other members of 
the Texas Tornados have the wherewithal to throw a good party without him. 
Freddy Fender is a master of '50s-style R&B balladry, Flaco Jimenez a Tex-Mex 
accordion player of intoxicating playfulness, and look for Augie Meyers to fire 
up his sprightly roller-rinky organ for some old Sir Douglas Quintet faves. 
Billed as "The Three Amigos," they play at the Coach House tonight, Oct. 13. 
(714) 496-8930. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Thelonious Monster is a checkered saga to say the least, but the 
band's erratic leader, Huntington Beach product Bob Forrest, is one of the most 
soulful songwriters and performers to have emerged from the '80s alternative 
rock movement. One Hit Wonder's catchy but blasting punk-pop makes it one of 
the local scene's most deserving contenders to reap the rewards of that now 
lucrative style. Opening the show at the Foothill Tavern in Signal Hill today, 
Oct. 13, is Choclaty, fronted by Mike Martt. Taped information: (310) 984-8359. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-running, much-traveled Orange County band Big Drill Car winds up its 
touring campaign for '94 with a show at the Ice House in Fullerton on Monday, 
Oct. 17, giving its own energetic take on that locally ubiquitous punk-pop 
style. The Goops, Bottom 12 and Lidsville round out the bill. Taped 
information: (714) 740-3052.

SURFING: ROUGH STUFF MESSES UP CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rockin' Fig and Dave, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington Beach 
surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. surf 
teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I just came back from vacation in San Jose del Cabo but, according to Rockin' 
Fig, the real action was at the Oxbow World Longboard Championships at Malibu, 
where some fisticuffs overshadowed the contest. Whoooa! 
</P>
<P>
 The Sept. 25 incident involved La Jolla pro Joel Tudor, Tudor's dad, Hawaiian 
pro surfer Lance Hookano and an unidentified knee board rider, who refused to 
get out of Tudor's way during a contest heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig: I heard that Tudor's dad, Joe, paddled up to the knee rider and started 
to beef the guy, but instead they got into it. Lance went out and when he tried 
to separate them, the knee rider bit his arm, and before you know it, Lance 
goes boom, boom, boom and unloads on the guy.  
</P>
<P>
 The incident is serious for the Huntington Beach-based Assn. of Surfing 
Professionals, said ASP spokeswoman Meg Bernardo, who spent last week fielding 
numerous telephone inquiries about the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The knee rider was taken by ambulance for medical treatment, which included 15 
stitches, Bernardo said, and he also suffered a separated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Hookano has to appear in court, and he will be fined by the ASP. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each event usually has beach security," Bernardo explained. "But we haven't 
had anything like that happen before. From the ASP's point of view, it's a 
serious matter, and there will be fines levied against Lance and against Joel." 
</P>
<P>
 She said both surfers violated the ASP's code of conduct, which states that 
contestants are responsible for the actions of relatives, managers or any 
"representative." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides any fines, both surfers also face disciplinary action after the ASP's 
next annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Fig, who was in San Francisco announcing the Body Glove contest at 
Ocean Beach, how much authority a sanctioning body has to ask non-contestants 
to leave the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the thing. Out in the water it's kinda like neutral territory. You 
can't get carried away and physically abuse anyone. But hopefully you can get a 
lifeguard there to write someone a ticket. Lots of times contests have beach 
security who patrol the water, and they like to intimidate people. But 
realistically, no one owns the ocean.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, you can encourage intruders to use common sense, especially if they're 
getting in the way of a contest. 
</P>
<P>
 That's it. You gotta expect these people to get out of the way. I hear that 
Tudor may have missed a wave because of this guy, and that's what got his 
father angry.  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of relatives, Fig, ask me who we saw surfing down in Cabo. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, who did you see?  
</P>
<P>
 Pat Curren, the legendary '50s and '60s surfboard shaper and Tom Curren's dad. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did you see him? And how did you know it was him?  
</P>
<P>
 Spotted him while surfing at Shipwreck's. He rode there in a dune buggy. He 
pulled up while we were in the water on a big day. Gets out and he has this 
nicely shaped mini-gun. 
</P>
<P>
 My buddies and I recognized him from pictures in the Surfer's Journal. Older 
guy. Mustache. Likes to position himself way outside and wait for the biggest 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
 You sure it was him?  
</P>
<P>
 Yup. I said, "Hey, you look like Pat Curren, and he just nodded his head and 
smiled. I then told him, "Well, you're either Curren or you're Greg Noll after 
a Gloria Marshall diet!" 
</P>
<P>
 What did he say to that?  
</P>
<P>
 He started laughing hard. He said he lives down there in Cabo in a trailer. He 
didn't talk much. Our conversation was brief, and then he just paddled away. He 
did get the set wave, though, and rode it all the way to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It was fun surfing near a legend. In those early days, it was special for 
riders of Hawaiian big waves to have a Curren gun. He was and is considered a 
master craftsman, though he has tapered off. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Contests: The Oxbow Longboard Championships were held at Malibu, where waves 
were dinky until Hurricane Olivia brought good four-foot waves. Rusty Keaulana 
of Makaha, Hawaii, was first, winning the world title for the second year in a 
row. 
</P>

 Tribes: World Jungle, the Costa Mesa-based apparel company, puts on its third 
annual Gathering of the Oceanic Tribes on Oct. 21 and 22 at Lower Trestles. 
Start-up times are 6:30 a.m. both days. It's a fun, four-man team event, with 
32 surfing wear companies and surf shops competing, said organizer Dean 
Reynolds. It's an industry event, and each team must have a grommet 16 or 
younger, two open spots for a pro or amateur and one company exec. The awards 
ceremony, which is free and open to the public, is at 7 p.m. Saturday at San 
Clemente's China Beach restaurant.

 Fund-raiser: Jamaican Style in Fountain Valley is joining with Surfrider 
Foundation for an all-day crafts and music festival Oct. 22 at the Festival of 
Arts in Laguna Beach. It will benefit ocean preservation through the Laguna 
Beach and Newport Beach Surfrider chapters. Tickets available through

DO IT!: SEA KAYAKING IS ATTRACTING NEW FANS IN WAVE AFTER CURIOUS WAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a member of the Times Orange County 
Edition staff. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In warm water left over from summer and with fewer motorboats to get in the 
way, autumn is a great time for sea kayaking, according to Joanne Turner, one 
of the local pioneers of the booming sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Even just a few years ago, kayaks were a rare sight in local waters, but 
that's changing fast, thanks in part to Turner and her business partner, Doug 
Schwartz, who started offering lessons in the late '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year they opened Southwind Kayak Center in Irvine, and business is 
booming, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no longer those lone intrepid souls doing something no one else is 
doing," Turner said. "Now it's more like, 'Look at all those people kayaking. I 
want to try that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The shop offers a variety of lessons and tours. On Monday, Turner will be 
taking a group to Tonga in the South Pacific. Closer to home, folks who want to 
get a taste of the sport can try the "First Strokes" class, which will be 
offered Saturday from 8 a.m. to noon at Upper Newport Bay (an afternoon session 
may also be added; call for information). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's designed for those who are new to sea kayaking or want a refresher 
course," Turner said.  
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to get participants comfortable in calm water, and topics include 
a basic equipment orientation, an introduction to paddling techniques, and even 
some planned capsizes as part of a lesson in kayak safety. There is one 
instructor for every six students. 
</P>
<P>
 Other classes this weekend are already full but are offered all year, 
including basic instruction in open ocean kayaking and in negotiating surf. 
Class fees include equipment. (Wet suits are not needed yet, but will be later 
in the season. Rental is $10.) 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible to enjoy kayaking quiet bays without instruction, but even a 
single lesson can greatly enhance the pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nice thing about it, you can have fun even if you don't know what you're 
doing," Turner said. "But what most people end up doing is more of a puppy-dog 
paddle. (Kayaking) gets easier when you know you're doing."

 Air It Out, an NFL-sanctioned 4-on-4 football tournament, returns to Orange 
County on Oct. 22 and 23 at UC Irvine. The winner moves on to the championships

</P>
<P>
 Sign-up deadline for the UCI dates is Friday. Registration is $125 for each 
five-person team (four on the field, plus one substitute). For information, 
call (310) 829-5226. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: "First Stroke" sea kayaking class. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Saturday, Oct. 15, from 8 a.m. to noon (and on other weekends 
throughout the year).

Center in Irvine. 
</P>

 Church leaders, from the Vatican to the fundamentalist Bible Belt, have been 
wary of the movies for years, especially when it comes to screen depictions of 
Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Martin Scorsese's "The Last Temptation of Christ" was nearing release 
in 1988, the religious flak from around the world was predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 It had happened before. On the eve of the premiere of Pier Paolo Pasolini's 
"The Gospel According to St. Matthew" in 1966, the Vatican told good Catholics 
to avoid this offering from a confessed atheist. Ironically, the church came to 
admire the film, an earthy yet uplifting telling. Pasolini was absolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so Scorsese; there was no forgiveness as his picture opened. The New York 
filmmaker, known for such grimy American wonders as "Mean Streets" and "Taxi 
Driver," was even more loudly condemned, even though "The Last Temptation of 
Christ" is one of the most honest and intriguing presentations of Christ's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Primarily, what angered the devout about the movie (which screens Friday night 
as part of UC Irvine's "Cinema Potpourri" series) was an imaginative sequence 
depicting Jesus' life if he had not been crucified. Scorsese, staying true to 
the Nikos Kazantzakis novel on which the picture is based, shows Jesus having 
sex, making children, getting cranky, growing old and, all in all, behaving 
like any normal fellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Scorsese, in the end, provides a more reverential vision of Christ, who, after 
realizing he's been deceived by the devil in this earthly incarnation, begs to 
go ahead with his date on the cross. He's restored as the Messiah, and the 
spread of Christianity is set. But that didn't satisfy most religious circles, 
particularly those accustomed to having their heavenly symbols on a lofty 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
 The early warnings on the film were provoked by circulation of the script, 
which made it clear that Scorsese was planning a different approach. But his 
reputation as a director of realistic, street-aware films also figured in the 
theological worry. How much violence would there be? Nudity? Would everyone 
have a Bowery accent? There was plenty to be concerned over. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Last Temptation of Christ" may be Scorsese's most ephemeral and 
metaphorically heavy movie, but he hasn't forsaken his usual hard-nosed style. 
His Christ (played by Willem Dafoe with the confident intensity of a Hell's 
Kitchen gangster turned community activist) is so troubled by God's interest in 
him that he first thinks he's hounded by Satan. His reluctance to play along is 
so deep that he creates crucifixion crosses for the Romans to, as he tells us, 
"defy God." 
</P>
<P>
 Scorsese excels through scenes like that. He invigorates the familiar by 
presenting Jesus in a frank, humanistic way. Kazantzakis wanted readers to see 
Christ as a mortal confused over his own spirituality, who eventually becomes 
divine only by accepting the demands faith places on him. Scorsese connects 
with that, and it's clear that being the chosen one is no party of healing the 
sick and feeding the multitudes. Being God's messenger is a hard, 
psyche-shattering business. 
</P>
<P>
 At more than 160 minutes, Scorsese spends a lot of time making that point, and 
it's the picture's most obvious weakness. The magnitude of the story slows 
Scorsese down, gets him to plod; far from irreverent, his respect prompts him 
to agonize over the details, frequently losing the visual impact that energized 
his other, albeit more excitable and violent, movies. 
</P>
<P>
 His cast also takes getting used to. When Harvey Keitel, a Scorsese regular, 
shows up early on as Judas with a barely hidden East Coast accent, we hold our 
breath for a while, half expecting him to throttle a Roman or two while cussing 
like a Manhattan cabbie. Dafoe, as well as Barbara Hershey, Harry Dean Stanton 
and David Bowie in supporting roles, seem strange early on, and you wonder why 
Scorsese didn't take a tip from Pasolini and pick unknowns for these archetypal 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the story's grandeur, told in such a fresh, complex way, eventually erodes 
the doubts. Scorsese, by giving his hero more dimension than we've come to 
expect in any biblical representation, creates someone we know. This is a 
Christ you could run into on a street corner or at a coffee shop, a guy with 
unsettling charisma and a flock of nice ideas.

NEWSBITES: MERCI BOCUSE -- COOKING GOD TO GRACE O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

contributes to The Times Orange County. Information for this column can be

<TEXT>
<P>
 Legendary. Super-chef. Cooking god. These are adjectives routinely used to 
describe Paul Bocuse -- even when one tries to keep hyperbole to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Facts are facts. Bocuse was responsible for nouvelle cuisine. His three-star 
restaurant near Lyon is world renowned. In 1961 he was named Meilleur Ouvrier 
de France as best chef in the country, and in 1975 he became the first chef to 
be awarded the Legion of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
 And this week marks the great one's first official visit to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 So excuse the Four Seasons Hotel if it goes slightly over the top and bills 
Tuesday's dinner in its Pavilion restaurant "the culinary event of the 
century."  
</P>
<P>
 According to news releases, executive chef (suddenly sounds humble, doesn't 
it?) Michel Pieton would "assist" Bocuse with preparation of such dishes as 
pheasant consomme with wild mushrooms and lentils, and roasted veal chop 
"Orloff" with goose liver and truffle. But Pieton admitted that's not exactly 
true. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 69, Bocuse is no longer sweating at the stove like we do," Pieton said. 
"But he's with us advising and tasting, making sure the sauce is right." 
</P>
<P>
 The five-course meal, from soup to sabayon, costs $150 per person, which 
includes tax, gratuity and a signed copy of Bocuse's new book, "Bocuse's 
Regional French Cooking," for every couple. A Champagne reception will begin at 
6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Champagne Mumm will figure at that and other events this week, as will Mumm 
Cuvee Napa and Sterling Vineyards. Bocuse is spokesman for Mumm; all three are 
owned by Seagram Classics Wine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday at Pascal Epicerie, chef Pascal Olhats hosts a Champagne reception and 
Bocuse cook book signing. The event starts at 6 p.m.; the cost is $15, and hors 
d'oeuvres will be served. (The book costs $17.98.) 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, in a sold-out event at 7:30 p.m., Olhats will prepare a 
four-course Mumm dinner at Pascal Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Bocuse departs Wednesday for Los Angeles, but the wines of Seagram will stay, 
most notably at a four-course dinner featuring Sterling Vineyards at John 
Dominis. Chef Lasse Sorensen has paired Sterling's '92 Winery Lake Chardonnay, 
for instance, with Maine lobster cakes served on spicy California cole slaw and 
remoulade. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is $60 per person including tax and gratuity. An hors d'oeuvres 
reception begins at 7 p.m.

RESTAURANTS; SAM'S IN IRVINE WOOS WITH B.B.Q. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in the early '80s, I was a regular at a Monterey Park Chinese restaurant 
called Sam Woo. Later, I often ate at a nearby spinoff by the name of Same 
Ward, and then at still another, Sam World. (In Chinese, all three restaurants 
had the same name, pronounced roughly saam wo , and one suspects the owners 
were having a bit of fun with those quaint transcriptions.) 
</P>
<P>
 The original Sam Woo built a reputation for the best Chinese barbecue in the 
San Gabriel Valley: crisp-skinned duck, redolent of five-spice; roast suckling 
pig with a crackling skin; a sweet smoked sausage reminiscent of wild boar; 
chewy cuttlefish rubbed red with barbecue seasoning. Later, the owners branched 
out into seafoods, hot-pots and exotic delicacies. By 1987, Sam Woo and its ilk 
had become one of the busiest restaurant groups in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the news: a Sam Woo B.B.Q. has opened in Irvine. The Irvine place is a 
dead-ringer for one of those Chinese barbecues in Monterey Park or Alhambra or 
San Gabriel, from the harsh lighting right down to the enthusiastic, 
predominantly Chinese clientele. The restaurant sits in a commercial complex 
near the busy corner of Culver and Irvine Center drives, between a Chinese 
market called 99 Ranch and a place called Sam Woo Restaurant (that's Sam Woo 
restaurant , as distinguished from Sam Woo B.B.Q .; the restaurant is an 
upscale seafood house, to be reviewed soon).  
</P>
<P>
 It's clear as soon as you enter that this is a place for serious eating. The 
right half is a colorful takeout area, staffed by eager young cooks ready to 
chop you a duck, shovel up some barbecued tripe or dish something out from the 
steam table. The left half is crowded with Formica-topped tables and 
hard-backed chairs; that din in your ears is clattering dishes and various 
Chinese dialects being spoken at high pitch. Irvine has an ever-growing Chinese 
community; during the week, a large percentage of them eat lunch here. 
</P>
<P>
 Though this is a cash-only operation, the menu lists a staggering 223 dishes. 
That number includes barbecued meats, soups, hot-pots, noodle dishes, rice 
plates, congees (rice porridges) and specialty dishes -- in short, Cantonese 
standards ideal for the no-nonsense style of eating popular all over East Asia. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The natural starting place is barbecue. Sam Woo barbecue platter usually 
contains about four different meats, depending on what is in abundance on a 
given day. Ours had a few pieces of roast duck, a pile of sweet-edged char siu 
(barbecued pork) cut into strips, roast pig (skin on) and a few pieces of 
sliced cuttlefish on the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Pork intestine in spiced soy sauce isn't normally part of the platter, but 
tripe-lovers should request it, or merely add an order. This tripe has a firm, 
chewy texture and a sweet soy aftertaste, making it one of the most delicious 
organ meats I've ever tasted. Barbecued spare ribs of pork is popular among 
novice customers, who may not know the rewards of plain old barbecued pork. 
Char siu has the same marinade and texture as rib meat . . . you just don't 
have to work as hard for the reward.  
</P>
<P>
 If you're ordering a poultry dish such as soy sauce chicken or roast duck, ask 
for the house hot sauce (which is also terrific with the cuttlefish) and some 
of the orange-hued sweet-sour sauce, flavored with tiny bits of garlic and 
orange zest. Then move on to the soups. Some are palate-cleansers, such as the 
clam soup, which consists of nine or 10 clams (still on the shell) in a clear, 
faintly clam-flavored broth topped with a minimalist sprinkling of chopped 
green onion.  
</P>
<P>
 Others are assertively flavored, like salted egg with mustard green soup. 
Salted egg is a recurrent theme in the Cantonese kitchen, where it usually 
gives kick to rice porridges. Here it appears whole, poached in a clear broth 
thickened only with black mushroom, pieces of boiled pork and chunks of the 
mildly bitter, squash-like stem of the mustard plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hot-pots to try are beef brisket with turnip and roast pork with fried 
tofu. Both come in huge clay pots, and there is a good chance that the waiters 
will nod their approval as they set them down. The brisket hot-pot includes 
some bok choy and slightly caramelized turnip to cut the heaviness of the meat, 
and the only reason that the dish isn't brilliant is the relatively gristly, 
fatty brisket used. Pork and fried tofu taste great together, but remember that 
this is an oily, heavy dish, not something you want to order after you've 
already loaded up with barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, try the rice plates, such as minced beef and egg, shrimp with satay 
sauce or the simple, elegant roast duck on rice. A few of these dishes are 
rather banal, though. Shredded chicken with oyster sauce on rice is just 
chopped chicken in a thick gravy that contains no more than a rumor of 
mouth-watering oyster sauce. And diced pork with corn on rice reminds me of a 
TV dinner in which the three components somehow got mixed together. 
</P>
<P>
 Noodles in soup are all reliable, the soup part being a salty homemade chicken 
broth punctuated by the noodle you've ordered, such as won tons neatly pinched 
to order or sundry floury noodles with the proper chewy texture. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Woo is a pioneer, probably the harbinger of more good things to come in 
central Orange County. It's a Sam World after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Woo B.B.Q. is inexpensive to moderate. Barbecue is $4.25 to $11.95. Soups 
are $4.50. Hot pots are $5.95 to $7.50. Chinese dishes and rice plates are 
$4.25 to $8.95.

TRIED & TRUE; A TRIP THROUGH THE GASP CHAMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a free-lance writer who regularly contributes 
to The Times Orange County Edition. This column is one in an occasional series 
of first-person accounts of leisure activities in and around Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was hideous, ghastly, horrible, loathsome, grotesque and nauseating. 
</P>
<P>
 I liked it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it thoroughly eclipsed a reputation I'd formed in childhood for 
assembling really great Halloween "houses of horrors" in the garage, the 
Knott's Berry Farm "Halloween Haunt" was a delightful little meander through 
hell. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to think I was a pint-sized Stephen King, tossing headless, 
ketchup-splotched, newspaper-stuffed effigies out of the rafters onto my 
friends' heads, but after strolling around Knott's for a few hours last 
Saturday I've decided to fold the tent. Compared to these guys, I'm Casper the 
Friendly Ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 But in my defense, they probably have a better budget, which accounts for 
their having enough severed limbs to cover a football field knee-deep. This is 
no low-wattage, benign, parlor spookiness. This is the world's biggest slasher 
movie in the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a really great slasher movie. (Translation: Nobody pounces on you and 
rips off your limbs and flays you open like a split duck with a chain saw 
before chomping on your vital organs and shredding your gizzard with 
gore-dripping talons.) 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the action revolves around the Ghost Town area, and 
everything pivots on a single, inviolate, overarching principle: If there is a 
dark corner, a cranny, a shadow or any place of concealment at all, something 
is going to jump out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are a lot of somethings. On the nights of the Haunt (Oct. 14, 15, 
21, 22, 23, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31 from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.), several hundred park 
employees transform themselves into mutants and monsters of every kind, from 
the more conventional Frankenstein's monster type to something that looked to 
me like nothing more than ambulatory green slime. 
</P>
<P>
 They appear to love fog. That's how most visitors meet them for the first 
time. After entering through the main gate, you're directed down the main 
street of Ghost Town, which is unusually dark for the occasion. And just about 
the time you notice that the street is fairly choked with fog (very 
real-looking stuff, puffed out by concealed machines), the cast, nearly every 
one of whom seems to be armed with a rattling noise-maker, begins pouncing. 
</P>
<P>
 They aren't supposed to touch you. It doesn't really matter, though. They seem 
to have perfected the techniques of materializing out of nowhere. (A couple of 
them, fitted with metal-plated knee and hand pads, bolted from the shadows and 
slid noisily and quickly from one side of the street to the other, startling 
group after group of visitors into screaming fits.) 
</P>
<P>
 I decided to warm up with a visit to an old favorite, the Haunted Shack. This 
venerable bit of visual trickery has been transformed for the haunt into one of 
several themed "mazes" located throughout the park. In this case, the theme was 
a modern one: A benighted chemical plant has spilled deadly green ooze, which 
has either contaminated or wiped out everyone in sight. More fog, flashing 
lights, blaring warning horns, immense mutated bugs feasting on festering 
corpses, skeletons decomposing in vats of chartreuse goo, zombies with melted 
faces lurching around. I was so envious. 
</P>
<P>
 Appetite whetted, I took in a couple of other mazes: the House of Maniacs 
(which is just that, punctuated by a bit of human taxidermy, cannibalism and 
the standard complement of severed limbs) and the Lair of the Vampyre, a 
classically Gothic little interlude overseen by a Nosferatu-style vampire and 
quite a lot of fanged female sorts. One of the more hideous of them seemed 
intent on staring me down at close range. Noticing her attention, I naturally 
asked her for a date. (Alas, she ignored me.) 
</P>
<P>
 By then it was 8:30 and time for the first performance on the stage in Calico 
Square of the traditional yearly singing-dancing-slashing set piece, "The 
Hanging," a rather bloody send-up of several topical figures.  
</P>
<P>
 This year the performance was subtitled "Stop the Insanity," but nobody seemed 
to be able to. One by one, our man Freddy Krueger messily disposed of everyone 
from Rush Limbaugh to Forrest Gump to Roseanne 
Whatever-the-heck-her-name-is-this-week. 
</P>
<P>
 I went on an old favorite ride, the Calico Mine Ride, which for the Haunt is 
known as the Cavern of Carnage (by now, you've probably got the idea). And yes, 
there are actual live (sort of) monsters inside the ride, ready to leap out at 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of thing is infectious. About halfway through the evening, visitors 
started trying to scare each other, and I caught a few ambitious ones trying to 
scare a couple of monsters. It didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fine, gory evening, with a good, healthy amount of screaming, but I 
knew when I'd been beaten. I went home, admitted defeat, tore up my plans for 
this year's Garage of Gore and went to bed. I slept like the dead.

3-HOUR TOUR: A WORLD FOR LITTLE ONES AND LITTLE WONDERS FROM JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

frequently to The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are probably a thousand McDonald's in Japan by now, so it's only fair 
that at McDonald's Plaza in Fountain Valley you can find foo dogs and "fortune 
cats," kimonos and ramen. Among a number of specialty shops, one carries 
everything for bebe.  
</P>
<P>
 11 to 11:30: Bebe's World sells baby furniture, accessories, toys and 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a Wipe Warmer (come on, how would you like it cold?), Audio Therapy 
Sleep Tapes, "the tapes with a heartbeat," and a breast pump offering 
"everything you need to express yourself." Getting around is a major concern 
among little ones: Soft-padded babyheadrests have built-in speakers that adapt 
to most cassette players; Cart-a-Kid is a safety cradle for shopping carts. 
</P>
<P>
 Eating and going to the bathroom are also big. Snack and Play is a "neat 
little eat seat"; Perfect Potty is a five-way seat that serves three stages of 
toilet-training and then some. Oops! No Spill Feeding Bowl claims "the bowl 
within a bowl design catches spills before they happen!" There's always 
Absorb-a-Mess in case it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The Real Executive Lap Top Teether is a tiny computer with a soft keyboard and 
space bar that "soothes teething gums while promoting hand-eye coordination." 
For that special yuppie baby, there's a Perrier baby bottle. There's also a 
roomful of rocking chairs, not only for nursing but possibly because you'll 
need one by the time baby turns 3. 
</P>
<P>
 11:30 to noon: It is said that the fortune cat, with its left paw raised, 
brings 1,000 customers and, with its right paw raised, brings the fortune of 
money; at least that's what the little tags say. Either would be just dandy, of 
course, and you can find both right- and left-pawed cats in all sizes at 
Miyoshi Gift Shop. You might need a fortune cat to afford the more elaborate 
foo dogs ($600), fierce-looking figurines with lion manes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tissue boxes are far less mundane when decorated with such motifs as waves, 
fans and cranes. You can find all manner of chopsticks, Holographic Jump Ropes 
that "come alive in the sunlight" for $1.75 and, at the rear of the store, 
dolls starting at $7.95. 
</P>
<P>
 But high on the shelves are exquisite Kabuki and Noh dancer dolls, from $50 to 
$995, some with musical instruments. Each tells a story. "Those are brides; 
these are Kabuki dancers; this is an ordinary housewife," explained store owner 
Miyoshi Nakamura. "You can tell by the hairstyle. Misses or miss, you can also 
tell by hairstyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 12:30: Every aisle can be an adventure at Ebisu Oriental Market. 
</P>
<P>
 The store carries a cornucopia of rice crackers, roasted seaweed, fermented 
soybean paste, deep-fried fish balls and melon preserved in sake lees. There 
are five-pound bags of sake lees if you want to preserve your own melons. 
Cookbooks include "Wok Around Asia" and "A Taste of Tofu." Japanese plum honey 
wine has plums in the bottle; there's even Japanese Scotch. 
</P>
<P>
 In the freezer department are seasoned conger eels; soft shell crabs come 
three to a pack. These products are pure: The ingredients for "dried young of 
sardine" lists only "young of sardine"; salted fish guts, of course, also lists 
salt. For dessert, you can try ice cream and ice cream bars in green tea or 
sweet red bean flavors.  
</P>
<P>
 Fresh offerings include octopus by the pound ($10.95) and little live snails 
with very attractive shells in a bucket. Artistically prepared boxes of sushi 
are available for takeout, or you can buy a block of tuna and make your own 
sashimi. Also ready for takeout is musubi, or "spam sushi." Ingredients: rice 
and Spam.  
</P>
<P>
 12:30 to 1:40: Ebisu Ramen Restaurant will dispel any notions you may harbor 
about wet noodles. There is nothing limp about these flavors or, indeed, the 
helpings. 
</P>
<P>
 It took stamina to finish sutamina noodles with fried vegetables, pork and 
garlic and served with raw egg; most popular is champon, ramen with fried 
vegetables, seafood and pork (each is $5.75). My normally finicky 7-year-old 
dived into okosama ramen for children ($3.95), noodles in a soy-sauce flavored 
soup followed by vanilla ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Okonomiyaki are Japanese pancakes sort of like mayonnaise pizza, only lots 
better. The Ebisu Special ($7.50) comes with the works: squid, pork, beef, 
shrimp, oyster and -- moving! -- bonito shavings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast food? Perish the thought. We sat at the counter, where we watched a chef 
painstakingly make takoyaki, octopus dumplings with seaweed, bonito and ginger 
($3.95), and taiyaki, fish-shaped cookies filled with sweet red beans (75 
cents, three-order minimum). "He really cares about making stuff for us," noted 
my son. 
</P>
<P>
 1:40 to 2: There are more than a few treasures at modest Maruhachi. Hanging on 
racks are kimonos, robes and vests, but take a few minutes to admire the obi, 
sashes used with the kimonos; the more beautiful examples in the store cost up 
to $1,000. In what must surely be a unique merchandising ploy, the store also 
carries thermal reflective collapsible sports bottles. 3-HOUR TOUR

BASEBALL; TALKS TO CENTER ON SIGNING FREEZE

 Eugene Orza, associate general counsel of the baseball players' union, said 
Wednesday he expects to continue conversations with management officials today 
on the owners' request for a 45-day freeze on contract signings and a delay in 
the start of free-agent filing from Saturday to Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Orza said collective bargaining would probably not resume until next 
week because of business and travel commitments by many of the key people. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that the union would not make a decision on the freeze until 
Tuesday or Wednesday and that eligible players would be advised to hold off 
filing until then. Sources said Orza would like to trade acceptance of the 
freeze for return of the service time that players lost during the strike, but 
a management attorney said the owners would not agree to that. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the possibility of a bargaining agreement or eventual implementation of 
their salary-cap proposal, the owners say the freeze would prevent the 
possibility of players signing under two sets of rules while giving the two 
sides an extended period to concentrate on negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, however, thinks the freeze is designed to give the owners time to 
decide what they want to implement and to shorten the off-season decision time 
for prospective free agents and players in general.

 In an effort to prevent a repeat of last year's Rose Bowl scam that left 
hundreds of Wisconsin fans without tickets to the game, the federal government 
proposed rules to monitor air ticket operators.Under the Truth in Ticketing 
rules, expected to go into effect by December, operators who offer package 
deals to events without having tickets would be banned by the Department of 
Transportation.

MATH HELPS RESOLVE WHETHER TO SELL CAR; AUTOS: DECISIVE FACTOR IS NEW CAR 
PAYMENT. KEEP OLD CAR IF RELIABILITY IS NOT AN ISSUE, SAYS ONE EXPERT. 
</P>

<P>
 It runs like a dream, starts in the dead of winter and does a comfortable 65 
m.p.h. with nary a shake. But it's 4 years old, doesn't have a sun roof and, 
well, red is no longer your color. 
</P>
<P>
 When is it time to sell the car and plunk down many grand for a new model? 
Conversely, when should you hold on to a good thing? 
</P>
<P>
 Put aside, if you can, the subjective considerations of image, comfort and the 
desire for something new. That's a whole different story. For most, buying a 
new car or keeping an old one is a decision based on cost. 
</P>
<P>
 If money is not an issue, drop this and head down to your local car dealer. If 
dollars do count, go get a pencil and paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a financial analysis developed by consultants at Runzheimer 
International, consumers can decide whether to sell or hold, based not only on 
the resale value of their car but on what the car will cost in real dollars 
over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say you own a 1991 six-cylinder, four-door sedan. The car you are 
considering buying is a 1995 six-cylinder, four-door sedan. Your car cost 
$14,493 and gets 21 miles to the gallon. The new car costs $17,359 and gets 21 
m.p.g. 
</P>
<P>
 Your current car is paid for, and you'll have to finance the new one with a 
four-year loan at 8.5% annual interest. The down payment for the new car is the 
trade-in value of the old one. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an unusual decision to make, whether to sell or hold, because 
it's a depreciable asset that costs a lot of money," said Lee Czarapata of 
Rochester, Wis.-based Runzheimer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new car payments are the decisive factors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even through the newer-model car has a much greater trade-in value after four 
years and you save on repairs and maintenance, the monthly car payments, which 
total slightly over $16,500 in principal and interest over four years, more 
than counterbalance the factors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Runzheimer's analysis, the 1991 model's total costs after four years -- 
payments, fuel, licenses and repairs -- would be about $12,308. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years from now, the new car will cost $27,361, including those expenses 
plus the cost of principal and interest on the car loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Over four years, the 1991 model requires $100 more for fuel and oil (totaling 
$3,580) and $2,231 more (a total of $4,449) for repairs, maintenance and tires.

THEATER REVIEWS; RSC'S 'LITTLE SHOP' CAN'T DELIVER THE GOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That funky, doo-wop musical "The Little Shop of Horrors" is back again with 
its man-eating plant from outer space and its Skid Row florists, Audrey and 
Seymour, a pair of terminally love-starved misfits destined for comic disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the show comes to us courtesy of the theater arts department of 
Rancho Santiago College, which used to run something called the Professional 
Actors' Conservatory but which no longer does due to budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 I bring that up because this production obviously is being used as a training 
ground for a large company of players who look like they've been put on stage 
to get the hang of it. What "Little Shop" does for them is wonderful. They can 
use the training. What it does for the rest of us is a little less wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 The show itself offers plenty of offbeat charm, both through its story and its 
score. Lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken, the team best known 
these days for Disney's "Beauty and the Beast," adapted "The Little Shop of 
Horrors" in 1982 from a Roger Corman cult movie of the same name. They 
heightened the black comedy and added considerable wit with their bluesy, mock 
rock tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour, your basic schnook, and Audrey, your basic bimbo, work as clerks in 
Mushnik's failing flower shop. He pines for her. She's stuck on a kinky, 
motorcycle-riding dentist. The dentist, meanwhile, is stuck on pain and 
laughing gas and treats her like a human punching bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, did I mention the plant? 
</P>
<P>
 Growing in the shop is this peculiar-looking plant that Seymour affectionately 
names Audrey II. He keeps it as a pet. But Audrey II turns out to be 
dangerously hungry, a secret man-eater that keeps Seymour busy feeding it human 
blood (mostly his own) and body parts (mostly the dentist's). 
</P>
<P>
 As an exotic nutritionist, Seymour seems to me unmatched in all of 
musical-theater history, with the exception of that human-meatpie maker Mrs. 
Lovett in Stephen Sondheim's "Sweeney Todd." For low self-esteem equal to 
Audrey's, think back to Laura in the Tennessee Williams non-musical "The Glass 
Menagerie." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian J. McMillen portrays Seymour with straightforward simplicity. Though he 
lacks a distinctive singing voice, he seems naturally musical and on opening 
night did not have problems with pitch. Ashlee Lewis brings comic flavor to 
Audrey, though not enough. And she did have pitch problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey M. King conveys Mushnik's ethnic Jewish flavor. Mark Hewitt has a few 
energetic moments as Orin, the dentist. As Audrey II's voice and body 
respectively, Adrian G. D. Lopez and Robert Krueger Jr. combine skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Sheryl Donchey has staged the production with an eye to '50s-period 
detail. Her choreography for non-dancers also seems savvy. What she can't 
overcome, however, are those pesky dead spots of amateur performance: missed 
cues and lags in timing, to say nothing of technical problems like faulty mikes 
and uneven lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, did I forget to mention that "Little Shop" is a family musical? 
</P>
<P>
 It is. Really.

THEATER REVIEWS; STYLISHLY DARK 'KILLJOY' IS DEAD RINGER FOR SITCOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By M.E. WARREN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Mayer, who has enjoyed success writing for such television sitcoms as 
"M*A*S*H" and "The Facts of Life," holds true to his training by trying to 
include something for everyone in his play "Killjoy," billed as "a romantic 
comedy thriller." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Newport Theatre Arts Center this month, "Killjoy" is a light evening of 
punch lines and predictable predicaments, perfect for anyone who likes 
television but doesn't want to sit at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented with style under Ken Rugg's direction, it focuses on a familiar nest 
of domesticated snakes, the "dysfunctional" American family (is there any other 
kind?) complete with a single mom, a bullying ex-husband, a young and ambitious 
second wife, a scheming lawyer and the poor, put-upon kids who, in true 
Hollywood tradition, turn out to be far more mature and capable than any of the 
so-called grown-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Rugg's production is trim and self-assured, from the neat box set by designer 
John Nokes to the picture-perfect casting: Leading lady Linda Van Dine even 
looks like Carol Burnett. The characters and the comedy are so recognizable 
that the show seems to have a silent laugh track built right in. Even when the 
production missed a comic beat, the audience knew it was time to laugh.

 The stand-out performer is Stephen Chamberlain, whose nerdy, depressed Sonny

MOVIE REVIEW; 'OGLALA' TURNS TABLES ON ACCUSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the summer of 1975, two FBI agents were sent to the Pine Ridge Indian 
Reservation in South Dakota to investigate the theft of a pair of cowboy boots. 
What seemed routine turned violent: Both were killed in a gunfight with a group 
of Native American activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, three of the group were picked up for murder. Among them 
was Leonard Peltier, who is still in prison and who has become famous, at least 
to his supporters, as a symbol of justice gone wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmakers Michael Apted and Robert Redford are Peltier defenders, and their 
documentary "Incident at Oglala" -- being shown tonight as part of Cal State 
Fullerton's recognition of Latino Heritage Month -- presents the FBI and the 
legal system as co-conspirators eager to strip the accused of his rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Apted and producer/narrator Redford are less interested in 
determining actual responsibility for the deaths than they are in asserting 
that Peltier was railroaded. This isn't a film for anyone eager for answers -- 
or for anyone who believes in following the government blindly. It invites 
healthy skepticism and presents disturbing facts to support its point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incident at Oglala," which was given only limited release when it came out in 
1992, starts with the crime itself, which Apted and Redford imply may have been 
avoided if the FBI had been more sensitive to conditions at the reservation. 
The documentary notes that the Lakota Sioux living there were in a violent 
civil war between traditional Indian leaders and those supporting the 
government officials controlling Pine Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The place was, in other words, a tragedy waiting to happen. It already had the 
highest murder rate per capita of any region in the country. When the agents, 
both newly assigned, were shot execution-style, the FBI responded by 
immediately sending in 350 agents. Peltier, Bob Robideau and Darrelle Dino 
Butler, all members of the American Indian Movement (AIM), were charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Peltier's became a special case when, saying he was afraid that he wouldn't 
receive a fair trial, he fled to Canada. The government's efforts to bring him 
back and the subsequent trial are presented by Apted and Redford as a web of 
deception and manipulation. Even if Peltier was one of the murderers, "Incident 
at Oglala" condemns the way he was convicted by a system looking for scapegoats 
and revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most documentaries, this one has its share of talking heads recounting 
events or describing their roles in the case. But they tend to illuminate 
rather than numb. And Apted, who directed the 1992 theatrical release 
"Thunderheart," inspired by the killings and starring Val Kilmer, enlivens the 
pace with a few dramatic re-creations of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Incident at Oglala" is being shown tonight at 6 in the UC Theater at Cal 
State Fullerton, 800 N. State College Blvd., Fullerton. Free. (714) 773-3371.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: WITH THE ECONOMY HEATING UP AGAIN, THE ICEMAN COMETH 
BACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ON THE ROCKS: Don't let those pesky economists get you down with news of a 
lagging local economy. If ice machines are any indication, the South Bay's 
business climate may be warming. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Guzman, 37, recently resurrected his 10-year-old, bus-sized ice vending 
machine on Inglewood Avenue in Lawndale, and he's optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a downturn in the ice industry," he said. "But we know this 
business will work and we have faith in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The shoe box-shaped machine, which hums quietly next to railroad tracks and 
telephone poles along the busy street, dispenses 25-pound blocks of ice for $2 
or 7-pound bags of cubed ice for $2.25 in quarters. Guzman soon hopes to offer 
20-pound bags of cubed ice for $3. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Guzman turned off the machine when bills started piling up in the 
offices of Washington Dairy, his Whittier-based business. Although only three 
of his 10 machines around Southern California are now operating, he hopes to 
turn on another soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Since electric company workers flipped the switch recently to cool off the 
large freezer, Guzman said, the machine has sold ice to 50 to 100 customers a 
week. He said sales were boosted by the bright-orange "grand reopening" banner 
he draped across the front. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have a beautiful location there," he said. "I couldn't have picked a 
better spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman said he has yet to schedule a gala grand reopening celebration, but he 
hopes to have one someday soon.

 PARASOL PIRATE: Was it the wind, or something truly evil? 
</P>
<P>
 A Rancho Palos Verdes resident believes the updraft from a passing helicopter 
lifted his green and blue patio umbrella from its concrete stand and spirited 
it away last month. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of the 3000 block of Crownview Drive first told Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies that the helicopter lowered a cable and removed the patio 
umbrella from a concrete stand around 2:30 p.m. on a Wednesday. The case of the 
$420 umbrella was listed as a grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 But the resident, who wished to remain anonymous, changed his mind when he 
later found the umbrella about 1,000 feet from his home, said Sgt. Hector A. 
Zabala. 
</P>
<P>
 Zabala, however, says the case is not closed. He speculates that what one 
neighbor described as a gray helicopter -- and larger than a police helicopter 
-- was flying below the legal limit of 500 feet off the ground in populated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But without access to a flight plan, it will be difficult to find the 
helicopter that was in the area at the time of the alleged umbrella-naping, he 
said. "I don't think we're going to get a pilot to admit that he violated the 
airspace."

 BLOOD FEUD: Arco Refinery manager Abe Johnson's employees lost at the blood 
pumps; now he's headed for the gas pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carson refinery's employees recently challenged those at the Mobil 
Refinery in Torrance to a competition: who could collect the most blood for the 
American Red Cross. The losing refinery's manager had to pump gas for a day at 
the competitor's service station. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner: Mobil, which collected 600 pints of blood in a drive in late 
September. Arco employees collected nearly 400 pints.  
</P>
<P>
 "We do have Mr. Johnson's measurements for his Mobil uniform ready to go," 
said Mobil Refinery spokesman Barry Engelberg. 
</P>
<P>
 And to prove that it was all a good-natured contest, Mobil's manager, Joel 
Maness, agreed to pump the gas with him. QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "It surprises me that I feel this way about this pile of sand. There's 
something very different about pulling out weeds and planting plants, a rush 
that I've never gotten from saving a piece of land by political means." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fred Heath, president of the Los Angeles Audubon Society, on volunteering 
to save the habitat of the El Segundo blue butterfly. J8

COMMUNITIES TO GET MORE SAY IN USE OF CLOSED MILITARY BASES; LEGISLATION: UNDER 
A NEW LAW, WHICH WILL AFFECT A DISPUTED SAN PEDRO PROPERTY, HOMELESS GROUPS 
WILL NO LONGER GET PRIORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The use of closed military property, including Navy housing that is being 
abandoned in San Pedro, will be left largely in the hands of local communities 
under legislation passed by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law passed Friday, military bases are exempt from the Stewart B. 
McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, which gave homeless organizations 
first priority on all surplus federal property. The needs of the homeless still 
must be addressed in plans devised by communities, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, introduced by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and expected 
to be signed into law, will affect California particularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-two bases have been targeted for closure or realignment under the Base 
Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. Homeless groups have applied under the 
McKinney Act to use all or part of 16 of them.  
</P>
<P>
 Congressional sources said the McKinney Act, enacted before the base closures 
law, was not designed with military bases in mind. It has polarized many 
communities, pitting residents against homeless advocacy groups that were under 
no obligation to consult the community about their plans for shelters.  
</P>
<P>
 A provision from a bill written by Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) was 
included in the new law, ensuring that local communities are notified when 
military property becomes surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Draconian remedy to impose solutions (for homelessness) on communities 
where their input is minimal," Harman said. "We really have a total victory 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation was written after consultation with the national Interagency 
Council on the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Pedro this year, many residents were outraged when federal officials 
approved an application by a South-Central homeless provider to run a shelter 
for up to 880 people in surplus Navy housing on Taper Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials recently revoked their approval to Turner's Technical 
Institute Inc. after finding that 60% of the site was not suitable for homeless 
use because of its proximity to two aviation fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, the San Pedro Area Reuse Committee will have nine months to 
submit a plan for the Navy housing and land to the Housing and Urban 
Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The department then will review the plan to ensure that the local committee 
has included provisions to adequately address the needs of the homeless.  
</P>
<P>
 Turner's spokesman, Samuel Theus, said the organization has not been notified 
of the recent changes to the McKinney Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last we heard from (the Health and Human Services Department) we could 
resubmit our application," Theus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's wants to work with the San Pedro community to develop a homeless 
shelter, he said. But Health and Human Services, which approved applications 
under the McKinney Act, has been taken out of the process, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law is retroactive; only operating shelters will be protected and 
allowed to continue, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Pedro committee has indicated that it wants to use the Taper Avenue 
site for senior citizen housing. Chairman Doane Liu said the community does not 
want to work with Turner's Institute because members believe the organization 
is not qualified to run a shelter.

CHAPTERS IN SAGA OF EMBATTLED CITY TREASURER KEEP HER IN SUSPENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alice E. DeLong pored over Michael Crichton's latest novel as though her job 
depended on it. The book, "Disclosure," which involves a power struggle and 
allegations of sexual harassment, reminds the embattled Redondo Beach city 
treasurer of her life in City Hall, she says.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you don't even know why things are happening," she said. "It's all 
part of the suspense. It's all a calculated game." 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong, the city's elected treasurer for 19 years, has been under fire since 
February, when City Manager William E. Kirchhoff told the City Council he could 
no longer supervise her office because she mistreated employees and failed to 
properly manage the city's $40 million in investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, an attorney for a city employees' union made public several 
employees' allegations that DeLong comes to work under the influence of alcohol 
and intimidates employees. Attorney Sylvia E. Kellison also told the council 
that a supervisor in DeLong's department had sexually harassed three employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has got to stop," Kellison told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong, 61, vehemently denied the charges. She said city officials are working 
to dismantle her department and drive her from office. She is up for reelection 
in March but has not decided whether to seek another term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think this is a real power struggle," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since several city workers met privately with the council in June to voice 
complaints about the treasurer's office, four disgruntled employees have 
transferred out of the department. The council hired a consultant to study the 
issue, but has not released the findings. And the council has not taken any 
action against DeLong, Kellison said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kellison, a supervisor in DeLong's department occasionally 
grabbed the buttocks of three women workers. Another supervisor accepted money 
over the counter from an individual applying for a permit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong said the employees never filed grievances with the city, and they never 
reported incidents of sexual harassment to her. She cannot deal with problems 
she does not know about, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Kellison said the employees did not follow the city's grievance procedures 
because they feared retaliation. "There's no obligation to file a grievance if 
you think it's going to be fruitless," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has not publicly responded to Kellison's complaints. Kirchhoff 
said he has dealt with personnel problems involving the department's staff, but 
he cannot discipline DeLong because she is an elected official.  
</P>
<P>
 DeLong filed an $8-million claim against the city in July accusing council 
members and other officials of harassment, libel and defamation of character. 
</P>
<P>
 She also claimed that officials violated the City Charter by interfering with 
her duties as treasurer.  
</P>
<P>
 Named in the claim were Mayor Brad Parton, the five council members, City 
Atty. Jerry Goddard, Kirchhoff and two former employees. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials rejected the claim last month.

HE ANSWERS CALL OF THE WILD WITH A HELPING HAND; ANIMALS: A ROLLING HILLS MAN 
RAISES, REHABILITATES AND IN SOME CASES RELEASES BIRDS AND OTHER CREATURES TO 
THEIR HABITAT. OF HIS BACK-YARD HOBBY, HE SAYS: 'IT'S LIKE A GIANT PARK UP 
HERE.'

 The quail are coming. Along with pheasants, ducks, raccoons, hawks, crows, 
butterflies, turtles, wolf-dogs, snakes and emu. 
</P>
<P>
 They can all be found in the back yard of Stephen W. Shultz's Rolling Hills 
home.  
</P>
<P>
 Shultz, an executive with Shultz Steel, which his father founded, has been 
raising and rehabilitating birds and other animals in his back yard for eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the city of Rolling Hills honored him for releasing about 300 
pheasants and 500 quail on the peninsula.  
</P>
<P>
 Shultz, 42, would like to return to the days when he was a kid, when flocks of 
quail 60-strong were a common sight on his front lawn. He estimates that 30 
years ago, thousands of pheasants and quail roamed the peninsula. Now only the 
birds he raises and releases can be found, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz and other members of the city's Wildlife Preservation Committee say one 
possible reason the birds don't thrive is feral, or wild, cats who prey on 
them.  
</P>
<P>
 By releasing the birds, "we're probably just feeding the predators," said 
Arvel Witte, a member of the preservation committee. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the committee, the City Council agreed Monday that residents 
should be educated about controlling the feral cat population. Officials have 
no population figures, but say feral cats are a nationwide problem.  
</P>
<P>
 The council stopped short, however, of approving a proposal to trap and spay 
or neuter the wild cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz said house cats also eat the birds, and pointed out that his cats wear 
bells to warn the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason given for the falling bird population is increased development 
throughout the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz says birds intrigue him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like birds. I think they're graceful." However, he concedes, "I think 
they're stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 But his interest is not confined to birds. His 14-acre homestead includes an 
85-foot-long raccoon cage, a butterfly house and a home for Tyler, a California 
desert tortoise. Shultz said he has permission from the state Department of 
Fish and Game to keep the tortoise, an endangered species, because it is used 
in classrooms for educational purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Shultz's dogs, Wolf, is two-thirds wolf. (The rest is malamute, with a 
little coyote thrown in.) 
</P>
<P>
 He says flying and barking critters have been a constant in his life. There 
was the wedding gift 15 years ago of two Chinese pheasants. Then there was the 
time 10 years ago when his kids begged for goats. Shultz bought two African 
Pygmy goats; now he has 12. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, he became interested in emu, distant relatives of the ostrich. 
So five years ago, he acquired George and Barbara, named after the Bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz estimates he has spent up to $40,000 on his hobby, which includes 
supplying pheasant eggs and incubators to classrooms. He is planning what he 
says may be the largest flight cage for recovering birds in Southern California 
-- 450 feet long and up to 15 feet tall. The cage has curves and changes in 
elevation, he explains, to help recovering birds hone their flying skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz is also at work on a new brooder, or heated cage, for raising chicks. 
And that is not all. Just downhill from the proposed flight cage, where the 
Pygmy goats now live, Shultz is planning a small zoo that would be open to the 
public. He hopes to present his plans to the city by the end of the year, but 
acknowledges it may be an uphill battle to get approval in a gated city with no 
businesses and 2,000 residents who value their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz says he receives an occasional complaint that the animals are too loud, 
but is able to remedy the problem by moving the animals in question away from 
the neighbors in question. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a giant park up here," says Shultz, who, if he has his way, will 
someday be able to say it's just like a zoo.

POLITICAL NOTES; A SCORE 'IN THE 90S' PUTS DILLS IN THE GREEN WITH CONSERVATION 
GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 IMPROVED SCORE: During the primary, the California League of Conservation 
Voters characterized state Sen. Ralph C. Dills(D-El Segundo) as an 
environmental fraud.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, the group is endorsing him over his Republican opponent, David Barrett 
Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills "has shown this year that he became a very good vote on the 
environment," said Doug Linney, political director for the group. "He's been 
very straightforward and sincere with us. We're going to believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 The group based much of its opposition to Dills during the primary on his 1993 
record: He voted for legislation that the group supported only 39% of the time, 
Linney said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he scored "in the 90s," Linney said. Among other things, Dills 
backed a ban on offshore oil drilling in state tidelands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to improve their scores and he certainly has shown he has 
improved his," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills has said that he's been going green because he's in a new district with 
more eco-conscious constituents. His old district was carved up in 
reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cohen says the group's about-face "proves they are a partisan 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE AIR: At 84, Dills' political career predates TV, but he is the first 
candidate in his race to take command of the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 His campaign debuted a nostalgia-themed commercial on South Bay cable systems 
Monday, in which he trumpets his endorsements from police, firefighters, 
teachers and nursing groups, as old-time piano music plays in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad, which cost $5,000 to produce, will be seen up to 10 times a night on 
Paragon Cable in Torrance, the heart of Dills' district. The campaign chose to 
invest in the commercials -- which cost as little as $11 per airing -- rather 
than on new billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DOLLARS FOR DILLS: At a debate two weeks ago, Dills predicted that state 
Republicans would invest as much as $500,000 in challenger Cohen's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't happened yet. Cohen had a war chest of $53,085 to Dills' $77,834 as 
of Sept. 30, according to campaign finance documents. Since July, Dills has 
spent $84,776 to Cohen's $26,271. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not expecting $500,000," Cohen said. "(Dills) just wanted to take the 
spotlight off his own fund raising and special interest contributions." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills has defended his campaign fund raising. While almost all of it in the 
latest reports comes from political action committees and corporations, he said 
that the money represents a wide range of interests, including the beer and 
wine industry, waste haulers, teachers and labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for the 54th Assembly District, Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor Steven 
Kuykendall has $32,439 in cash on hand, ahead of Assemblywoman Betty Karnette 
(D-Long Beach), who had $26,224. But she has outspent him: $59,711 since July. 
Kuykendall has spent $44,722.

 Assemblywoman Debra Bowen's (D-Marina del Rey) funding was far ahead of 
challenger Julian Sirull in the 53th Assembly District. She has $79,546 on hand

 TAX AND SPEND: Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks has pressed Rep. 
Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) for a one-on-one debate, but she was recently 
left to spar with a surrogate. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman's spokesman Roy Behr stood in for the congresswoman Saturday at a forum 
sponsored by United We Stand America, the group organized by Ross Perot's 1992 
presidential campaign, at the Torrance Airport on Saturday. Harman had been in 
session in Washington until late the night before. Brooks, however, said Harman 
refuses to debate her one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without Harman, the clashes were forceful. Brooks chided Harman for 
voting for President Clinton's economic plan, which raised taxes; Behr said 
Brooks supported taxes while on the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council, including 
levies for landscaping and lighting and another on rounds of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 And he charged that she also supported the statewide snack tax, placed on 
cookies, chips, candy bars and bottled water. He was referring to a 1992 vote 
in which Brooks and the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council opposed a move by 
state lawmakers to repeal the snack tax. Voters repealed the tax in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The snack tax "would have cost hundreds of millions of dollars for California 
taxpayers," Behr said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the debate, Brooks denied that she backed the snack tax. But her campaign 
said she simply opposed the erosion of the city's revenue base. "This tax was 
already on the books," said campaign manager John Perkins.  
</P>
<P>
 She campaigned for City Council in 1991 saying that she would not support a 
tax unless it went to a vote of the people. She characterized the landscape and 
lighting fees as assessments that are "absolutely accountable" to the people. 
The golf tax, she said, will be imposed on a private course "that has not been 
built yet." 
</P>

 EVENTS: Assemblywoman Karnette and challenger Kuykendall will square off 
Tuesday before the San Pedro Coordinating Council. The two are candidates in 
the 54th Assembly District, which covers the Palos Verdes Peninsula, San Pedro 
and Long Beach. The event starts at 11:30 a.m. at Peck Park Auditorium, San 
Pedro. Call (310) 832-5289.

<P>
 The City Council has tentatively approved controversial plans to construct a 
54,000-square-foot shopping complex at Artesia Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members unanimously supported the plan for a Smith's Food and Drug 
Center after a public hearing on the issue Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-hour hearing drew many public comments for and against the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents want the city to use the eight acres of vacant land for a park, 
incorporating a wetland, known as the Gardena Willows, which is next to the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to officially approve the center at its Oct. 25 
meeting. SUSAN WOODWARD

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; 2 CITIES SETTLE SUIT WITH STEPS TO CUT POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two South Bay cities have agreed to spend $800,000 to settle a lawsuit 
charging that they failed to adequately control pollution flowing into local 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo and Hermosa Beach violated the Clean Water Act, according to the 
suit, which was filed last year by the Natural Resources Defense Council and 
Santa Monica BayKeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement reached last week, El Segundo will develop a runoff 
control plan and spend about $750,000 to rebuild two storm-water pump stations 
and upgrade filtering equipment. Hermosa Beach agreed to implement a $50,000 
storm-water control program and contribute $7,500 toward the Santa Monica Bay 
Restoration Project education fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, which was among the first filed under the federal Clean Water 
Act, the environmental groups alleged the cities violated a permit issued by 
the Regional Water Quality Control Board by failing to take adequate measures 
to reduce pollution entering city storm drains. The drains empty onto area 
beaches and into local waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, city officials will develop educational programs and 
inspect local businesses and industries for illegal dumping. Businesses failing 
to control pollution will be cited and possibly fined. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Tamminen of BayKeeper, a year-old environmental organization, said El 
Segundo and Hermosa Beach lagged far behind other South Bay cities in 
controlling runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 He said El Segundo officials failed to remove debris regularly from 
storm-water catch basins, allowing pollutants to clog pipes and eventually 
pollute beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But El Segundo City Manager James W. Morrison said the city merely failed to 
keep thorough records of maintenance work. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hermosa Beach, city workers regularly cleaned a street-sweeping vehicle 
near a storm drain at 6th Street, allowing debris to be washed into the drains, 
Tamminen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermosa Beach City Manager Stephen Burrell said the city has employed a 
contractor to sweep the streets since July, and such practices, if they did 
occur, do no longer. JAMES BENNING

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Palmdale man has been arrested in connection with the shooting of a Hermosa 
Beach woman who survived for up to four days with three bullets in her head, 
authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Linda M. Dillon claimed she had tried to commit suicide, but now 
says Jeffrey Ray Locke, 41, shot her, said Hermosa Police Capt. Mike Lavin. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, police arrested Locke on Sunday on suspicion of shooting Dillon, 
57, several days before police found her semiconscious Oct. 3 on her apartment 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon, a computer consultant who works at home, was in critical condition 
after the shooting, but her health has improved in the last week, Lavin said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the shots were fired through a pillow, which was found soaked 
with blood in Dillon's car a block away from her apartment. No gun was found. 
</P>
<P>
 During a search of Locke's home, police found two .22-caliber rifles, one 
AK-47 assault weapon and a 30-30 Winchester rifle. No handgun was found, but 
police seized ammunition in Locke's home and car, Lavin said. The car was 
impounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavin said Locke and Dillon once worked together at Hughes Aircraft before she 
retired and he was laid off. To earn money, Locke recently did handy work for 
Dillon in her apartment, Lavin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Locke was arraigned Tuesday in Torrance Municipal Court and is being held in 
lieu of $500,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors discovered Dillon had been shot after X-rays revealed three bullet 
fragments in her head. JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: LAWNDALE; PLANNING OFFICIAL OUSTED IN UPROAR OVER DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Edie Warwick has been removed from her position by the 
City Council for overstepping her authority as a city official and because 
charges have been filed against her in the case of a missing dog.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the unanimous vote Monday, Councilwoman Virginia Rhodes said complaints 
from other city officials and a captain in the Lennox sheriff's station about 
Warwick's behavior prompted her to call for Warwick's removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Warwick has been accused in incidents unrelated to the dog controversy of 
ordering the unauthorized operation of the city's wading pool and using her 
position when complaining to sheriff's officials about an abandoned car.  
</P>
<P>
 But her behavior stirred the most controversy when she was charged with 
misappropriating lost or stolen property, delaying an investigation and filing 
a false police report in the case of the missing dog.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives say Warwick found the dog and refused 
to give it to Joseph and Vicky French, the dog's owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Larry L. Rudolph, who appointed Warwick to the planning commission 
in May, said Warwick's disregard for law enforcement in that case led him to 
vote for her removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Warwick had the dog for a time, it has since disappeared and Warwick 
says she does not know where the dog is. 
</P>
<P>
 But detectives say Warwick, using a false name, hid the dog at a Torrance 
kennel for three days. Employees at the kennel identified Warwick.  
</P>
<P>
 Warwick is to be arraigned Oct. 20. She declined to comment on the charges 
against her or her removal from the commission. JON GARCIA

<P>
 For now, the two-year battle to drill for oil under the Newport-Inglewood 
earthquake fault has come to an end, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood and Vortex Oil Energy and Minerals Ltd. reached an agreement Friday 
with the city of Los Angeles and the citizens group Coalition Against the 
Pipeline, killing the drilling proposal, said Inglewood City Atty.Howard 
Rosten. 
</P>
<P>
 Vortex had planned to operate as many as five exploratory oil wells on a 
1.1-acre site next to the Inglewood Park Cemetery. Los Angeles and the citizens 
group sued to stop the project, saying that a full environmental report is 
required for the project.  
</P>
<P>
 Some members of the citizens group charged that drilling under a fault could 
trigger an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the drilling project June 7 unaware of a zoning law that 
prohibits drilling in a cemetery zone, said Assistant Los Angeles City Atty. 
Jack L. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way around (the law). Someone didn't do their homework," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials do not rule out future attempts at drilling. JON GARCIA

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; SHOPPING CENTER WINS APPROVAL TO PROCEED

<TEXT>
<P>
 The developer of a shopping complex that is expected to boost city revenues by 
about $2.5 million a year received approval to go ahead with the project 
despite concerns about traffic congestion in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously approved the development Monday on 76 acres 
bounded by Torrance Boulevard and Main, 212th and Figueroa streets.For more 
than 60 years the site served as an oil refinery and storage area. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Michael I. Mitoma said the project appealed to him because of the sales 
tax revenue retail stores would generate. 
</P>
<P>
 Several property owners questioned whether Torrance Boulevard, where it is 
spanned by the Harbor Freeway, could adequately serve the new development and 
the proposed Metro 2000 outlet mall nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 To improve traffic flow, the developer agreed to remove the sidewalk on one 
side of Torrance Boulevard and repaint the street to include a left-turn lane. 
Additional right-turn and driving lanes are also expected to ease congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies by Carson Town Center Inc., the developer of the project, showed that 
the improvements they would make would decrease traffic congestion, said 
spokesman Allan Mackenzie. Traffic engineers estimate 20,530 cars per day will 
visit the new center. 
</P>
<P>
 Those shoppers are expected to generate about $1.9 million in sales taxes. 
Property taxes for the parcel will provide the city about $815,000. MARY

TRACT

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of the Island View housing tract have gained preliminary approval to 
restrict access to the public streets surrounding their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the City Council voted 4 to 1 to begin proceedings to hand over a 
small part of Whitley Collins Street near Crest Road to the Island View Home 
Owners' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The association plans to build a card-controlled gate that would restrict 
access to approved cars. Pedestrian access to the estimated 90 homes would not 
be restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to curb crime, the association has asked to restrict access three 
times since 1992, according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
 Because restricting access to public roadways may open the city to a lawsuit, 
the homeowners' association must also pay the city's legal fees if the 
arrangement wins final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Steven Kuykendall, who voted against the measure, said he was worried 
about a lawsuit against the city. State law prohibits a city from restricting 
access to public streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Atty. Carol Lynch said such an action may be legal if part of the 
street is private. JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; POLICE OFFICERS OK 3-YEAR CONTRACT

<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than three years without a raise, Torrance police officers have 
voted to accept a 7.1% increase over the next two years and a package that 
calculates their third-year raise based on the pay at other departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers voted 138 to 7 in favor of the three-year contract.The original 
package offered a 7.1% increase over two years and no guarantee of what the 
increase would be in coming years, said Officer Joe Simpsona negotiator for the 
Torrance Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said the new deal will base third-year salaries on a survey of 10 
local police forces, including those in Beverly Hills, Hawthorne and Redondo 
Beach. Members of the department will receive an increase of 40% of the 
difference between their pay and the average of the top three departments in 
the survey, to a maximum of 5%. In addition, they will receive a raise each 
year in accordance with the rise of the consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 29, 75% of the department called in sick and earlier that month 
officers picketed City Hall to protest the stalled talks. The officers objected 
to receiving the same raise other city workers got, which included 7% wage 
increases over the next two years, Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaries in the Police Department range from $38,760 a year for first-year 
officers to about $50,000 a year for more experienced officers, Simpson said.

SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY; BUTTERFLY SAFETY NET; EXPIRATION OF A $430,000 GRANT 
WORRIES VOLUNTEERS WORKING TO RESTORE DUNES NEAR LAX WHERE THE EL SEGUNDO BLUE 
FLOURISHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They stride across the dunes like foot soldiers in some ecological army, 
sporting T-shirts emblazoned with a single blue butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stoop to do battle with the alien ice plant and brushy acacia trees that 
threaten the El Segundo dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Others kneel in the sand to plant native shrubs that vanished from this 
seaside kingdom long before many members of this volunteer gardening army were 
born. 
</P>
<P>
 What has brought these volunteers here, weekend after weekend, is a heartfelt 
vision that time can be rolled back and the dunes restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mission is to rebuild an ecosystem that vanished a generation ago as 
urban Los Angeles pressed toward the sea. They operate by a simple but delicate 
equation: banishing the ice plant and other non-native species while nurturing 
coast buckwheat, the El Segundo blue butterfly that feeds on it and a myriad of 
other plants and insects that once called the dunes home. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's icon is the El Segundo blue, a federal endangered species whose 
primary home is this fragile snippet of dune-scape wedged between sprawling Los 
Angeles International Airport and the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the ice plant is nearly vanquished. The butterfly is flourishing, up 
from 400 10 years ago to more than 10,000 today. But on this misty October 
morning, what should have been a celebratory event -- a salute to a job nearly 
finished -- takes on a somber cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggering concern is the Oct. 7 end of the $430,000 grant that financed 
restoration work under the direction of Rudi Mattoni of Beverly Hills, who has 
received national attention for his fight to save the El Segundo blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, no one knows for sure how the dunes will be protected in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who looks after these plants that we've just planted?" asks a frustrated 
Mattoni. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Segundo dunes is at a crossroads. When the grant expired last week, 
responsibility for the area moved from the city Department of Environmental 
Affairs to the city Department of Airports, which owns the dunes.  
</P>
<P>
 The juxtaposition is a curious one: LAX, the nation's third-busiest airport, 
high-tech launching pad for hundreds of jumbo jets each day, is charged with 
protecting the habitat of a fluttering thumbnail-size butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an airport official promises to "do the right thing by the dunes," 
some environmentalists are nervous that a mammoth agency accustomed to dealing 
with high-powered airlines and fast-flying machines may not fully grasp the 
importance of buckwheat and insects. After Mattoni began studying the dunes for 
the Department of Airports in 1984, he discovered that it contained 28 plants 
and animals that are native to the Southern California dunes system.  
</P>
<P>
 But years of development and soil contamination helped foster non-native 
species, he reported, threatening the survival of native wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 As departing jets screech overhead on this overcast Sunday, Mattoni and his 
supporters issue a rallying cry to about 60 people gathered at the dunes for 
the last scheduled volunteer cleanup-and-planting effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work is not done," said Jon Earl, director of Rhapsody in Green, a Los 
Angeles environmental group that has championed the dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 A botanist shows a group of Westside students how to plant seedlings of 
coastal buckwheat and how to mulch them with withered strands of ice plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Harrison, 17, of Van Nuys displays the spindly gray insect called a 
"walking stick" she just discovered in a pile of mulch. On an earlier visit, 
she reported, she found two legless lizards, which she describes as "worm-like 
with scales."  
</P>
<P>
 As the volunteers weed and plant, Mattoni, 66, stands slightly apart, ear 
protectors cupped around his neck, observing the activity with deep blue eyes 
that nearly match the blue of the butterfly imprinted on his T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 In a playful moment, he disappears under a tattered, turquoise-colored tarp 
until his head re-emerges through a hole in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as giggling teen-agers watch, he slowly flaps his tarp-covered arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweet butterfly . . ." he sings under his breath. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni's life has been intrinsically tied to blue butterflies -- the El 
Segundo blue he has helped preserve at the dunes, the Palos Verdes blue 
butterfly he rediscovered in San Pedro this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the butterfly is simply a metaphor, he says, of the complex native 
ecosystem that is slowly taking root again. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni, a UCLA visiting lecturer in geography and environmental science, 
talks passionately of the dunes' other crown jewels, the 11 species of plants 
and animals that can be found only on this narrow strip of sand: the El Segundo 
goat moth, the El Segundo Jerusalem cricket, the Lange's dunes weevil, the El 
Segundo spineflower, the El Segundo crab spider. 
</P>
<P>
 He sounds astonished that others might not notice the mysteries to be found 
here. It is baffling to him that Angelenos can be obsessed with saving the 
Amazon rain forest -- even reporting the acres lost on a lighted digital 
monitor outside the Beverly Center's Hard Rock Cafe -- while they ignore the 
home-grown wonders just west of LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how many insects there are in downtown L.A.," he laments. "We 
don't even know what we have right here." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni found his first blue butterfly 50 years ago mounted in a cardboard box 
at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, he was a schoolboy fascinated by butterflies, collecting them, 
puzzling over the colors of caterpillars that clung to the bush outside his 
bedroom window in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as a teen-ager during World War II, he visited the dunes for the first 
time and witnessed the butterfly alive. The airport was tiny then, and only a 
few houses perched on the dunes. He remembers flocks of butterflies and huge 
expanses of coastal buckwheat. 
</P>
<P>
 He left Los Angeles to study entomology at UC Berkeley, returning to earn his 
Ph.D. at UCLA in population genetics. 
</P>
<P>
 His resume portrays him as a Renaissance man of science, assessing the effects 
of the first atomic explosion on native insect populations in New Mexico, 
conducting studies on astronauts' personal hygiene in space. 
</P>
<P>
 A company he founded produced millions of cotton pink bollworm moths -- so 
named because of their bright pink larvae -- that were sterilized with 
radiation and used to control the bollworm attacking the San Joaquin Valley 
cotton crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is not a professional entomologist, he kept returning to 
butterflies -- especially blue butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1984, he returned to the dunes, charged with studying how blue 
butterflies and other native insects remained. 
</P>
<P>
 The dunes had changed dramatically since he last saw them. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the dunes coastal buckwheat was probably destroyed when homes were 
built. Ice plant, which was popular among developers who used it to stabilize 
sand, can squeeze out the remaining buckwheat and other native species.  
</P>
<P>
 "The ice plant was all over the place. It was ghastly," he recalls. To worsen 
matters, after constructing Pershing Drive on the dunes' east side in the 
1970s, the city had planted the wrong kind of buckwheat, Mattoni said. Instead 
of coast buckwheat -- the sole food of the El Segundo butterfly -- workers had 
planted common buckwheat, throwing the ecosystem out of sync.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the most startling changes of all was not on the dunes, but above them. 
As many as 900 to 1,000 low-flying jets roar above the butterflies and walking 
sticks each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the noise can be deafening, volunteers are so passionate about the 
dunes cause that they simply bring earplugs. One volunteer last week wore a 
Sony Walkman as he planted buckwheat, hoping to drown out the jet noise with 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was the burgeoning growth of LAX that created the dunes 
preserve and thus enhanced the El Segundo blue's hopes for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Once houses and streets covered the very dunes where the butterfly now 
frolics. But the rise in jet traffic in the early 1960s forced the removal of 
almost 800 homes under the noisy takeoff routes, baring the dunes again. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the preserve exudes an eerie sense of in-between. 
</P>
<P>
 Remnants of the old neighborhood remain, like ruins of some Roman village. 
</P>
<P>
 Cracked concrete streets run like frayed ribbon through the dunes, weeds 
sprouting through the cracks. Street numbers are barely visible on decaying 
curbs. A peeling yellow fire hydrant sits next to one dune, and brick steps 
lead nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most of the area has returned to wilderness, a soothing tapestry of 
brown-gray shrubs against tan sand. Then, a dune away, LAX comes into view, its 
terminals and control towers spread across the horizon like a space age 
metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 This juxtaposition of sand and city, nature and technology endows the 
restore-the-dunes project with much of its drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300-acre area is the last large remnant of a series of dunes systems that 
once ran from Point Conception north of Santa Barbara to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials had long planned to use about 200 acres of the cleared dunes 
to build a seaside golf course, with the remaining 100 acres set aside as a 
preserve. But then the California Coastal Commission questioned how the 
development would affect the El Segundo blue butterfly.  
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter helped spearhead a 1990 city agreement under 
which 200 acres were designated a preserve, with 100 acres to the north set 
aside for the golf course. Activity shifted to restoring the dunes, although 
airport officials say that a golf course is still possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni and his colleagues have been working to restore the dunes, most 
recently with the $430,000 grant from the state Resources Agency and a $75,000 
grant from the Coastal Conservancy. The work was overseen by the city 
Department of Environmental Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has spawned a small but intensely loyal band of defenders. 
Hundreds of volunteers, including UCLA professors and Westside schoolchildren, 
regularly visit with trowels and gardening gloves.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the Department of Airports shoulders responsibility for the dunes, 
trepidation is apparent among some dunes defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to assure those people that we're not going to turn our backs on the 
work they've done," Phil Depoian, Department of Airports deputy executive 
director, promised last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mattoni says the airport has promised only that he can volunteer at the 
dunes for an additional 30 days. He has no idea if he will be allowed on the 
site after that time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter has written airport officials to urge them to plan for long-term 
maintenance. She said last week that she is "reasonably optimistic" that the 
airport can be persuaded to arrange for that maintenance, which she estimates 
would cost about $45,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmental groups have banded together to form the Coastal Dunes 
Conservancy, hoping to provide management and scientific expertise for 
preserving the dunes, said Fred Heath, president of the Los Angeles Audubon 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Department of Airports, Depoian said last week that he does not know 
enough about the conservancy plan to say if it is feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, environmentalists hope the airport will continue to allow the 
hands-on volunteer work that they say has been key to the restoration's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It surprises me that I feel this way about this pile of sand," said Heath. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something very different about pulling out weeds and planting 
plants," Heath said, "a rush that I've never gotten from saving a piece of land 
by political means." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the dunes restoration project wound down Friday, Mattoni stacked nursery 
pots from the El Segundo project into his faded Volvo station wagon and drove 
them across the South Bay to a little-known military fuel depot in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, during a routine biological survey in March, Mattoni and fellow 
researchers found the Palos Verdes blue butterfly, believed to have been 
extinct for a decade. The area had never before been surveyed for butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its distant El Segundo cousin, the Palos Verdes blue is classified as an 
endangered species, and only about 200 were estimated to be living last spring 
at the U.S. Navy's Defense Fuel Supply Point near Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Mattoni has his way, those numbers will grow. He hopes to restore the 
area much as he has the LAX dunes, re-vegetating it with native plants such as 
the locoweed upon which the Palos Verdes blue feeds. 
</P>
<P>
 As he stored the nursery pots in a fuel depot bunker last week, he glanced at 
the thick carpet of green ice plant nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 He grimaced. "There you go. That's got to come out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The politics of a fuel-depot restoration may prove simpler than the dunes 
project. The land is owned by the U.S. Navy, which Mattoni says has supported 
his efforts so far. The depot is a park-like area, with 26 tanks below ground 
and only three aboveground, posing little interference for the butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palos Verdes blue is a relatively unknown butterfly, compared to the El 
Segundo blue. It apparently vanished from the Palos Verdes Peninsula in the 
early 1980s, after most of its breeding sites were destroyed by housing 
development, fire control and the expansion of a city park. At the time, its 
disappearance was believed to be the first time a creature protected by the 
Endangered Species Act had become extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite front-page reports of its re-emergence last spring, the Palos Verdes 
blue is relatively unknown, lacking the political and popular backing of the El 
Segundo blue. 
</P>
<P>
 So Jess Morton of the Palos Verdes/South Bay Audubon Society hopes to build up 
public support for the butterfly. He wants to see schoolchildren help in the 
restoration, much as they helped restore the El Segundo dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, although we have something that was lost because of lack of concern, we 
have a second chance," Morton said, "and we rarely have that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni's natural ebullience surfaces as he talks of planting locoweed for the 
butterfly to feed on. He begins ticking off the other key native plants for the 
fuel-depot ecosystem: California sagebrush, black sage, bush sunflower. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like the dunes," he explained. "By doing what you can do to save 
the butterfly, you're going to augment the whole community, and therefore 
everything will benefit . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll go from one rebirth to another."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; STUDIO READY TO ROLL ON DRIVE-IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bucking a trend that has threatened to make drive-in theaters obsolete, the 
city may once again crank up the projectors at Studio Drive-In, which had shown 
movies for 45 years until it closed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Theaters, the last operator of the drive-in at Sepulveda and Jefferson 
boulevards, shut it down in September, 1993, because it was losing money. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Vitagraph Pictures, a post-production and editing studio in Marina del 
Rey, has proposed using the screen at least one night a week to preview some of 
the movies the company edits, the way private theaters now preview films for an 
invited audience.  
</P>
<P>
 The Culver City Redevelopment Agency, which owns the property, plans to review 
the proposal this month. The agency is also considering a long-term proposal to 
develop the property for housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, it's show time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it's going to be a gold mine, but it will help us establish a 
preview audience," said George Zarcadoolas of Vitagraph Pictures. Oliver Stone 
has expressed interest in previewing some of his movies at the drive-in, 
Zarcadoolas said. 
</P>
<P>
 To give the drive-in an unusual flair, Vitagraph plans to line up antique cars 
at the front of the theater. And, harking back to the 1950s, the theater will 
employ carhops. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Culver City drive-in makes a comeback, it would be an oddity on the 
Westside, where multiscreen, surround-sound movie theaters abound. Even 
stranger is that Culver City, home to several movie studios, has had no public 
movie theaters since the drive-in closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Such theaters have been closing nationwide, as people opt for the multiscreen 
theaters. There are about 1,000 drive-ins nationwide, down from about 4,000 in 
the late 1950s, when they were running strong. MARY MOORE

COMMUNITY NEWS: UCLA; CAMPUS RALLY KICKS OFF NATIONAL COMING OUT DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students, faculty, elected officials and activists gathered at UCLA on Tuesday 
to kick off National Coming Out Day, an event organizers hope will encourage 
people to openly declare their homosexuality and show unity within the gay and 
lesbian community. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally, organized by representatives of several student organizations at 
UCLA, marked the beginning of a week of campus activities that included the 
listing in the Daily Bruin of the names of 325 openly gay and lesbian UCLA 
students, faculty and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Held at the campus's Westwood Plaza, the rally featured speeches by David 
Mixner, a consultant to President Clinton on gay and lesbian issues; 41st 
Assembly District candidate Sheila Kuehl; swimmer and gold medalist Bruce 
Hayes, and actress Amanda Bearse of the TV show "Married With Children." 
</P>
<P>
 The noon rally, attended by about 100 people, was interrupted periodically by 
three fundamentalist Christian activists who called homosexuals sinners. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl, a UCLA alumnus, told of her experience as a sorority member who, coming 
back from summer vacation, found her lover's letters spread out on the coffee 
table for all to see. She was summarily dismissed from the sorority and found 
that she could not confide in anyone about her homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was going to die and I was terrified I wouldn't," said Kuehl of 
her experience.

 11-HEADED MONSTER 
</P>
<P>
 What has 22 legs, can move on the ground or through the air with equal skill 
and travels close to one-third of a mile on an average night? 
</P>
<P>
 It's the El Camino College offense, the unstoppable beast of community college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (4-0) rank No. 1 in the state in total offense, averaging 561 
yards and 44 points a game. El Camino gained 562 yards Saturday in a 49-20 
victory over defending national champion Palomar and is averaging 8.5 yards a 
play, nearly a first down on every snap. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no national statistics are kept, Hank Ives, editor and publisher of 
J.C. Grid-Wire, said El Camino "without a doubt" has the most productive 
community college offense in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best offensive team we've had since I've been here," said Coach John 
Featherstone, in his 10th season at El Camino. "We have more depth at wide 
receiver and more depth at running back than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors' depth at running back has paid off in the past two weeks. 
Starting tailback Morell Ollis suffered a broken collarbone Sept. 24 against 
Fullerton, but freshman Zak Swoopshire has filled in admirably, rushing for 
more than 100 yards in victories over Golden West and Palomar. Swoopshire is 
averaging 8.9 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of Swoopshire, the team's fastest back, and fullback Robert 
Jenkins, the team's leading rusher with 477 yards, has taken the pressure off 
quarterback Steve Sarkisian and given El Camino a more balanced attack. When 
Ollis returns to the lineup in a few weeks, Featherstone said he will rotate 
the three running backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Featherstone can afford the same luxury at wide receiver with the talented 
trio of Leandrew Childs, Russell Shaw and David Saraf. Childs leads the team 
with 25 catches for 407 yards and seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors' depth even carries over to the offensive line, where tackles 
Tevete Usu (6-foot-5, 310 pounds) and J.R. Herring (6-4, 285), guards Demetrius 
Hamilton (6-3, 265) and Ryan Winkler (6-2, 270) and center Jimmy Omatsu (6-1, 
250) are supported by three capable freshmen: Al Guerrero, Rene Sandoval and 
Curtis Armour. 
</P>
<P>
 The line has given up only three sacks, allowing Sarkisian enough time to 
complete 76% of his passes (85 of 112) for 1,322 yards and 14 TDs. GAME OF THE 
WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino, ranked fourth in the nation, will face its toughest challenge to 
date when it meets eighth-ranked Cerritos (4-0) in a Mission Conference game at 
7 p.m. Saturday at Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos leads the conference in rushing, averaging 245 yards a game, and El 
Camino ranks fifth in rushing defense, allowing 134 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our biggest test, no question," Featherstone said. "Cerritos is a real 
solid football team." 
</P>
<P>
 Although El Camino is ranked ahead of Cerritos in the national J.C. Grid-Wire, 
the Warriors (third) trail Cerritos (second) in the JC Athletic Bureau state 
top 20. San Francisco City (4-0), O.J. Simpson's old school, is ranked No. 1 in 
the state and sixth in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricks (Ida.) (6-0) is ranked No. 1 in the nation. WAITING LIST 
</P>
<P>
 The early signing period apparently will come and go without Inglewood High 
basketball standout Paul Pierce committing to a college. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce told Jeff Fellenzer of The Times that he will almost certainly wait 
until the spring before signing a letter of intent. He has narrowed his list of 
prospective schools to Kansas, UCLA, USC, California, Arizona and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball players who want to put the recruiting process behind them can sign 
during the early period of Nov. 9-16. But since Pierce has not yet scored at 
least 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, he has not been able to take any 
campus visits. He took the SAT for the second time Saturday after scoring 650 
on his first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-6 Pierce, considered the top senior prospect in California, denied the 
validity of a recent radio report that said he had already made an unwritten 
commitment to UCLA. MOVIN' ON UP 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula High football Coach Gary Kimbrell was braced for a struggle. But 
imagine his surprise after the Panthers took a 29-0 halftime lead against 
Leuzinger en route to a convincing 35-7 Bay League victory on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never in my wildest dreams did I expect something like that," Kimbrell said. 
"I thought it was going to be a tough football game." 
</P>
<P>
 It was tough all right -- on Leuzinger. The previously unbeaten Olympians had 
two serious problems against Peninsula: their offense couldn't move the ball 
and their defense couldn't stop the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of quarterback Peter Krogh is perhaps the biggest reason for 
Peninsula's improvement in recent weeks. After playing poorly in a 9-6 loss to 
Mira Costa, Krogh has led the Panthers to blowout victories over San Dieguito, 
West Torrance and Leuzinger by running the option effectively and completing 
timely passes. He ranks second on the team in rushing behind running back 
Petros Papadakis. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimbrell said he had a talk with Krogh after the Mira Costa game, telling him 
that if Peninsula was to have a successful season, the quarterback would have 
to play a bigger role than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year as a junior, Krogh didn't have to do a lot," Kimbrell said. "Just 
not make any mistakes and not lose the game. He wouldn't have to win one for 
us. This year, he's more involved in our offense. He has to execute and be 
poised and read the option. He has accepted the challenge and is doing a great 
job." WORRY, WORRY 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne Coach Dan Robbins scouted the Peninsula-Leuzinger game and came away 
impressed by the Panthers, calling them the team to beat in the Bay League. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne, the three-time defending champion, and Peninsula are tied for first 
at 2-0. They meet Oct. 21 at Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm worried," Robbins said. "(Peninsula is) just so solid in every 
respect. And they're as fast as I've ever seen them." 
</P>
<P>
 A more pressing concern for Robbins is his team's inability to hold on to the 
ball. Hawthorne lost four fumbles Friday as it struggled to beat winless 
Inglewood, 29-19. The Cougars trailed until late in the third quarter when 
Dominick Cribbs blocked a punt and recovered it in the end zone to make the 
score 20-19. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 23, Hawthorne had seven turnovers in a 52-11 loss to Mater Dei. FAB 
FRESHMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Led by setter Tracy Holman, the Loyola Marymount women's volleyball team 
extended its winning streak to six matches last weekend by beating Portland and 
Gonzaga in West Coast Conference play at Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Holman, a freshman from West Torrance High, was named WCC player of the week 
after recording 96 assists, 24 digs and four aces in the two victories, which 
kept Loyola atop the standings at 4-0. She leads conference players in assists 
a game (12.3). 
</P>
<P>
 Holman's selection marked the third time this season that a Lion was named WCC 
player of the week. Kim Blankinship and Mardell Wrensch received the honor on 
Sept. 19 and Oct. 3, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (10-5) travels to the Pacific Northwest this weekend for rematches with 
Portland on Friday and Gonzaga on Saturday. NOTABLE 
</P>
<P>
 * Damin Hurst of Harbor College was named Western State Conference running 
back of the week after rushing for 96 yards and three touchdowns in 16 carries 
Saturday in a 33-29 loss to Santa Barbara. Hurst, a sophomore from Banning 
High, ranks second among conference rushers with 538 yards and eight TDs. 
Harbor (0-5) plays at Bakersfield (4-1) on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 * A benefit over-the-line softball tournament for Jim Zambarelli, a former 
North Torrance High football and baseball standout who has leukemia, is 
scheduled for Oct. 23 at Hermosa Beach, south of the pier. All proceeds will go 
toward testing for a bone marrow match for Zambarelli, 38. Free blood tests 
will be conducted the morning of the tournament at Security Pacific Bank in El 
Segundo. The tournament fee is $50 a team. Information: Russ Johnson (310)

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: FOR LOVERS . . . AND MEAT-EATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to celebrate somewhere deluxe? Head over to Auberge at Barnabey's Hotel 
in Manhattan Beach, possibly the most romantic dining room in the South Bay. 
This elegant Victorian restaurant, lit by small red chandeliers, features 
intimate booths, partially shielded with red velvet drapes.Even when full, the 
room is so quiet you could hear a quenelle drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, it's not only the decor at Auberge that's special. Chef Matthew 
Fitzgibbons' interest in food was ignited at age 12, when he had dinner at the 
Syracuse, N.Y., home of a friend whose dad was a contributor to Gourmet 
magazine. Many years later, Fitzgibbons got his break at the Depot in Torrance, 
where he learned California cuisine from respected chef Michael Shafer. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin, grilled polenta comes atop a mass of shiitake, oyster and 
chanterelle mushrooms in a veal reduction with garlic and shallots ($6.95). Won 
tons are filled with pork, rock shrimp and ginger, then given a kick by a 
wasabi-emboldened creme fraiche ($6.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Among the pastas, fettuccine comes with tenderloin of beef in a sauce of 
Gorgonzola cream and wild mushrooms ($13.95). For lighter tastes, there's angel 
hair tossed with olive oil, roasted peppers, fresh basil and Parmesan ($9.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh fish specials are offered, but the forte at Auberge is meat. A thick, 
grilled free-range veal chop with smoked bacon comes with shiitake risotto 
($23.95). Loin of venison, filet mignon, rack of lamb, even chateaubriand -- 
all the old meat-eater's favorites -- are here. 
</P>
<P>
 Auberge is at 3501 N. Sepulveda Blvd., Manhattan Beach. (310) 545-8466. Open 
daily 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 10 p.m.

 As a child, Judith Love Cohen was fascinated by the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it wasn't a piece of cheese or anything like that," said Cohen, who 
writes children's books. "My father would talk to me about the moon, and to me 
it was mysterious and poetic, like a large, beautiful, honey-colored pearl." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father also played numbers games with his daughter -- games that turned 
out to be basic algebra and geometry problems. The play led to a lifelong 
affection for numbers, and ultimately Cohen combined her interests, working as 
an engineer at TRW during the Apollo missions. 
</P>
<P>
 And two years ago Cohen wrote "You Can Be a Woman Engineer," a book for girls 
that describes the types of engineering -- mechanical, electrical and chemical 
-- and how she chose to become an engineer herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Cohen, 61, has written -- with other female professionals -- six 
books encouraging girls to enter fields traditionally dominated by men. The 
books, geared toward third- to sixth-graders, were first available primarily in 
museum bookstores. Now they are in mainstream stores such as Bookstar and have 
been purchased by school districts and educational organizations.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District bought about 1,000 books, which sell 
for $6 each. About 18,000 have been sold, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories, written on pink, purple, orange and yellow paper, are illustrated 
by Cohen's husband, Davis Katz. In addition to the story of Cohen's career in 
engineering, the book series tells stories about women working in architecture, 
marine biology, paleontology, zoology and Egyptology. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the book series came from a monthly column that Cohen wrote for 
Engineer of California magazine while she was working for TRW. In 1990 she 
wrote a piece about her life as an engineer, and Katz, a Los Angeles teacher, 
encouraged her to write her story specifically for little girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think boys are naturally better at math and science than 
girls," Cohen said. "But I think what happens is that (girls) who are good at 
it don't feel motivated to go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen does not have horror stories of discrimination as she pursued a degree 
in electrical engineering first at Brooklyn College and then at USC, where she 
earned a degree in 1957. Instead, from adolescence onward she occasionally met 
with lukewarm encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in fifth grade, there were many girls who were good at math, but 
when I was in junior high school, I was taking intermediate algebra and I 
looked around the class and realized I was the only girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that did happen to me, though -- in high school, there was a club 
to help prepare people for scholarships and they wouldn't let girls take the 
class," Cohen said. "But I studied for it, and that year I was the only one 
from the high school who got the scholarship. That was my vindication." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Cohen worked on one of the first satellites, a story recounted in the 
opening of "You Can Be a Woman Engineer." 
</P>
<P>
 "BLAST OFF! The rocket ship was blasting to the moon. My heart was pounding. I 
was sitting in the control room, calculating math equations and watching this 
rocket go. Soon, the satellite would be in space." 
</P>
<P>
 The high point of Cohen's career, however, was working on the backup guidance 
systems for Apollo missions 11 through 17.  
</P>
<P>
 The backup was used on the Apollo 13 mission when the primary system 
malfunctioned and the astronauts relied on it to return to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Cohen worked on an information relay system for the Hubble 
space telescope. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, who retired from TRW in 1990, is now a consulting engineer for 
companies such as Litton Data Systems in the San Fernando Valley and Logicom in 
San Pedro. She writes and gives readings at bookstores throughout the county at 
least once a week.

FERRARO CRITICIZED FOR FAILING TO FIX QUAKE-DAMAGED BUILDING; POLITICS: POSTAL 
OFFICIALS WHO LEASE COUNCIL PRESIDENT'S BUILDING THREATEN TO HIRE A CONTRACTOR 
THEMSELVES. HE SAYS HE HAS BEEN DELAYED BY COMPLICATED NEW SEISMIC SAFETY 
RULES. 
</P>

<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service has taken on Los Angeles City Council President John 
Ferraro, saying that nine months after the earthquake, he has failed to make 
needed repairs to a damaged Woodland Hills building they rent from him, leaving 
postal workers worried about their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by the delays in repairs, postal officials are seeking a contractor 
to repair cracked walls and crumbling columns that support steel beams in the 
ceiling, which is being temporarily held up by scaffolding. They plan to send 
Ferraro the repair bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want him to think that we are declaring war," said post office 
spokeswoman Terry Bouffiou. But, she added, "We've gotten to a point where we 
are not willing to wait any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro said he intends to fix the building but contends that his efforts have 
been slowed by a new city seismic retrofitting law, which he authored. He said 
he was unsure when the repairs would begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in the hands of an engineer right now," he said. "I'm doing everything I 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing himself to many other landlords struggling to begin repairs, 
Ferraro, who represents parts of North Hollywood and Griffith Park, said he has 
already spent about $22,000 to repair the building's quake-damaged air 
conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those postal people are very hard to satisfy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal officials, however, said Ferraro only fixed the air-conditioning after 
sweltering postal workers complained during the summer heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro bought the empty lot at 22121 Clarendon St. in 1963, though he said he 
does not recall the sale price and county property records do not reflect it. 
He built the original post office that year and helped finance an expansion in 
1975. Two years later, he leased the building to the U.S. Postal Service for 20 
years, charging $176,000 a year, according to records and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3.62-acre lot and the 30,000-square-foot building is valued at $2.3 
million, according to property records. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-story building -- in which 200 or so postal employees work -- suffered 
$200,000 damage in the quake. It was closed to the public for several days, 
forcing postal officials to move the operation to a large tent in the 
building's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouffiou said city building inspectors declared the building safe for public 
use the week after the quake, but only after the Postal Service paid for 
cosmetic fixes to the front lobby and for installation of the temporary ceiling 
supports. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, from the public counter area, the post office looks modern, clean and 
well-kept -- glistening with a fresh coat of red, white and blue paint. But 
quake damage is visible in the cavernous back section of the building, where 
workers sort mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Large cracks run like veins along the walls. Four tall scaffolds line the 
interior, supporting huge horizontal ceiling beams that were previously resting 
on cracked and crumbling concrete columns. One of the employee bathrooms is 
off-limits because a scaffold blocks its entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouffiou said the Postal Service has been unable to get Ferraro to accept 
responsibility for repairs and has recently sought bids from contractors to 
make the fixes. She said the Postal Service plans to hire its own contractor by 
the end of October, and to pass along the bills to Ferraro. If the council 
president begins repairs before then, Bouffiou said the Postal Service will 
halt its independent repair plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious that we don't agree (with Ferraro) on this, but we have to move 
ahead," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro said that the Postal Service may not understand the complexity of his 
repair effort, which requires the engineer he hired to first devise a way to 
comply with a new seismic retrofitting law that requires additional 
reinforcements on certain kinds of buildings. He said the new rules complicate 
the repair process. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro has voted with a majority of the council to adopt nearly a dozen new 
seismic safety laws in the past nine months, and authored the ordinance that 
now governs the repair of the building he owns. 
</P>
<P>
 The post office was assembled using a technique known as "tilt-up" 
construction, an inexpensive construction process employed on about 2,100 
older, warehouses and industrial buildings in the Los Angeles area. Under the 
process, prefabricated walls are placed on the foundation, tilted upright and 
fastened together. 
</P>
<P>
 Because such buildings suffered significant damage in the Northridge quake, 
the City Council in February adopted Ferraro's proposal to require owners of 
"tilt-up" structures built before 1976 to strengthen connections between walls, 
floors and ceilings to meet modern safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro's retrofitting law gives the owners of "tilt-up" buildings a maximum 
of three years to make the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro owns two other rental properties in Los Angeles County.

PROP. 187 OPPONENTS CONFRONT EZELL; IMMIGRATION: INITIATIVE PROTESTERS DISRUPT 
LUNCHEON. CO-AUTHOR OF THE MEASURESAYS HE WILL MAKE NO MORE APPEARANCES UNTIL 
ELECTION.

 A dozen shouting protesters crashed a women's club luncheon Wednesday to 
confront former INS Regional Director and keynote speaker Harold W. Ezell over 
his support of Proposition 187, the initiative that would restrict education 
and health services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters, who included several San Fernando Valley clergymen, surrounded 
Ezell in a banquet room of the Sportsmen's Lodge as he was served his lunch, 
then followed him around the room, shouting at him until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no arrests and order was restored after about 15 minutes. But Ezell 
-- apparently worn down by protests directed at him personally -- said his 
appearance before the Encino Republican Women Federated group would be his last 
until election night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to be the issue, and they don't pay me enough to be the issue," 
said Ezell, who later gave his planned speech to the club after the protesters 
were escorted outside. "I told my wife six weeks ago that I would accept no 
more speaking engagements." 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach businessman said he would be visiting South Africa for 10 
days and, with other out-of-state commitments, did not plan to return to 
California until shortly before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell, co-author of Proposition 187, has been the target of criticism by 
opponents of the initiative, who last week briefly disrupted a campaign forum 
at the Museum of Tolerance in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's protest was organized by members of Valley Organized in Community 
Efforts, a San Fernando-based coalition of 15 Catholic, Protestant and Jewish 
congregations. The coalition, commonly known as VOICE, claims to represent 
35,000 families. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters accused Ezell of assisting wealthy foreign business investors in 
gaining legal residence while backing a measure that would disproportionately 
hurt poor immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a coyote for rich people," said Father Pat Murphy of Our Lady of the 
Holy Rosary Church in Sun Valley, using the Spanish slang for an immigrant 
smuggler. "Why doesn't he want to help any poor people?" 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Ezell said later that as a private businessman he has assisted 
investors who qualify for legal residence under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy and a dozen others had entered the rented banquet room, walking quickly 
to Ezell's place at the head table, shouting, "We have some questions for Mr. 
Ezell!" They were met by shouts of "Get out of here!" from club members. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell refused to answer questions, finally getting up from his seat and 
wandering from one corner of the room to another, followed by the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Club President Pat Cook at one point used the microphone to beg Ezell to 
return to his seat to finish his lunch, while another club member used her 
napkin to try to shield the guest speaker from news cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell later called the party crashers "savages," congratulating the 50 or so 
invited guests for their well-mannered conduct during the protest.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a legal issue, not a racial issue," Ezell said regarding Proposition 
187. "And the conduct of these people today suggests anarchy. I was invited 
here to speak . . . and they come in and acted like a bunch of animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Club member Mary Werther said she did not feel in danger during the rowdy 
protest but "to disrupt our lunch like that was just unthinkable." 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell said the apparent groundswell of support for the initiative is similar 
to the feelings that propelled Proposition 13, the landmark property tax 
measure. He welcomes comparisons to Proposition 13 crusader Howard Jarvis, 
saying in his speech that Jarvis' widow told him, "I only wish Howard was 
alive, to see him stand shoulder to shoulder with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell was even mistakenly introduced by an embarrassed club member as "Howard 
Ezell." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, which is leading in public opinion polls, calls for 
verification of U.S. citizenship or legal residence for students of California 
public schools as well as anyone receiving medical services, except for 
emergencies. The initiative would also require police to notify federal 
authorities of anyone suspected of being in the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will put the fear of God into illegals more than anything else," Ezell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the initiative would create a new set of health, crime and 
illiteracy problems while doing little to slow illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think voters need to know the consequences of this bill and who's behind 
it," said one of the protesters, Ralph Midtlyng, pastor of All Saints 
Evangelical Lutheran Church in Sun Valley and Burbank.

EYE ON THE PRIZE; GLEEFUL OFFICIALS AND FACULTY HOPE USC'S FIRST NOBEL WILL 
HELP THE CAMPUS FINALLY SHED STEREOTYPE AS AN ACADEMIC LIGHTWEIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Across the USC campus the news that chemistry professor George A. Olah brought 
the university its first Nobel Prize was greeted Wednesday with joy and 
grateful relief. There is, it seems, nothing like the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 USC has lots of Heismans in its trophy case but desperately wanted a Nobel. 
"It was," one USC official commented dryly, "like an unscratched itch." 
</P>
<P>
 Never again would USC face the indignity of being left off the list of major 
California institutions with Nobel laureates on their faculties. Stanford has 
won 14 Nobel prizes, Caltech 12. Even cross-town rival UCLA boasts three. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, the 114-year-old University of Southern California. "Certainly, this 
university has wanted a Nobel winner for some time," USC's president, Steven B. 
Sample, exclaimed Wednesday in something of an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize, said faculty and students, gives USC powerful ammunition against 
old and annoying jibes about its image as the University of Spoiled Children, 
or worse, the University of Second Choice for serious academics. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is unlikely that Olah will ever be more famous than USC alum O.J. 
Simpson, the Nobel was welcomed as a deserved dose of academic acclaim for a 
school better known for its gridiron exploits. Olah joined USC in 1977, already 
renowned in the chemistry field for work that led to cleaner-burning gasoline 
and advances in oil refining. 
</P>
<P>
 Sample said he was pleased that the prize was awarded the year after a 
$120-million gift from Walter B. Annenberg for communications programs at USC, 
one of the largest grants in the history of higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, the Nobel and the Annenberg grant "will have a synergistic effect. 
That will be very helpful in student recruitment, fund raising and faculty 
recruitment," USC's president said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, perhaps, USC's dean of admissions and financial aid, thought 
ahead to this Saturday's football game with Stanford when he savored the prize. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Why not, said Joseph Allen, have the USC marching band spell out the word 
"Olah" on the playing field? After all, the Stanford band has taunted USC's 
academic reputation in the past by forming the average SAT scores of Trojan 
freshmen, which traditionally lag behind Stanford's scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful to have this new symbolism," Allen said of the Nobel. "It's 
strong evidence that this is a place that has improved its academic quality and 
is committed to keeping that going." 
</P>
<P>
 David Merkowitz, public affairs director of American Council on Education in 
Washington, agreed that the Nobel will boost USC's national reputation. "Having 
a Nobel laureate on the faculty is a sign of enhancement," he said. "And I'm 
sure they will use it for good measure in terms of recruiting and marketing." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, USC has been pushing for admission into the big leagues of 
national and international research universities. The school, whose main 
150-acre campus is located south of Downtown, ranks about 20th among American 
universities in the amount of federal research aid it receives, $225 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years before UCLA was admitted to the Assn. of American Universities, USC 
won entrance in 1969 to that premiere organization of research institutions, 
whose membership now totals just 56 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the university has been seeking to bolster the reputation of 
its undergraduate programs, which long have been the butt -- justified or not 
-- of in-house criticism and jokes from rivals Stanford and UCLA. Slightly more 
than half of USC's 27,864 students are undergraduates. 
</P>
<P>
 The current crop of USC freshmen averages SAT score totals just over 1100, a 
rise of about 100 points over a decade ago although still well below Stanford's 
or UCLA's. And counter to the image of an overwhelmingly affluent student body, 
60% of USC students receive some financial aid to help with tuition and living 
costs that can total more than $22,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Olah alluded to USC's changing image in remarks to his chemistry department 
colleagues hours after getting the phone call from Sweden on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you should have a balance in any institution, and USC is maturing, 
combining a first-class science and medical research effort with a successful 
athletic program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, several hundred faculty, staff and students gathered for a 
champagne reception at which Olah was applauded for more than a minute as he 
stood at the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so excited I am speechless," said Katherine B. Loker, an alumnus who in 
1990 donated $7 million to Olah's research. "When we first met him, I knew he 
was a Nobel Prize individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Nobel may have its most important effect in Southern 
California, USC officials said Wednesday. In some respects, the university is 
more respected out of state than locally, partly because of the cross-town 
shadow cast by UCLA and Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, it's harder to be recognized in your own back yard," said 
Morton Schapiro, an economist who is USC's dean of letters, arts and sciences. 
He forecast future Nobels for USC faculty, a game usually played by those other 
local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to get your first, but there will be other ones," Schapiro said.

A LEGAL TURF BATTLE; GANGS: COURT INJUNCTION FOR A 20-SQUARE-BLOCK AREA OF 
NORWALK HAS TAMED ORANGE STREET LOCOS WITH CURFEWS AND WEAPONS RESTRICTIONS. 
MANY RESIDENTS ARE DELIGHTED, BUT SOME SAY TARGETING ONE GROUP IS UNFAIR.

<P>
 By most accounts, the tiny Orange Street neighborhood in Norwalk is a changed 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Children play soccer just feet from an alley where gang members used to fire 
guns. Families take afternoon strolls down streets they once avoided. One 
resident who planned to move now intends to stay and remodel her house. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, this modest enclave of bungalow-style homes and aging 
apartment buildings, a mile south of Norwalk City Hall, had been a virtual war 
zone. Authorities and residents say the Orange Street Locos gang terrorized the 
neighborhood by firebombing homes, taunting passersby, using drugs in public 
and breaking into cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the city has resorted to an unusual weapon -- a court-ordered injunction 
that curbs the gang's activities in the 20-square-block area -- and the 
strategy appears to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference is like night and day," said Ralph Garcia, who has resumed 
nighttime walks to a nearby market. "Obviously, someone is getting through to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 But gang members and their parents condemn the legal assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't spit on the ground without getting a ticket," complained one 
19-year-old Locos member who keeps a watchful eye as he walks through the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The injunction, one of the first used to combat gang violence in Los Angeles 
County, bars 22 Locos members from carrying baseball bats, crowbars and other 
potential weapons in public. It also prohibits gang members from harassing 
people, blocking public thoroughfares and trespassing on property. 
</P>
<P>
 The court order lists 19 restrictions, including a 10 p.m. curfew for gang 
members under 18 and a midnight curfew for adult members. Violators could face 
up to six months in jail and $1,000 fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the targeted gang members have criminal records, including arrests for 
auto theft, burglary and possession of firearms. Some have been convicted of 
assault, armed robbery and arson. All have been stopped by sheriff's deputies 
for allegedly loitering, trespassing or drinking in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the injunction was granted in August by Norwalk Superior Court Judge 
Lois Anderson-Smaltz, Locos members have stopped hanging out on the streets and 
no longer party at night in alleys, residents and authorities say. Sheriff's 
deputies have had little contact with the Locos and have not arrested anyone 
for violating the court order. 
</P>
<P>
 The gang's "OSL" graffiti moniker, meanwhile, has virtually disappeared from 
garage doors and apartment buildings. City graffiti removers have not received 
a call since the injunction was issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are thrilled with the changes, prompted in part by additional 
sheriff's deputies who saturated the area in the weeks after two firebombings 
last February. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel safe when I'm outside," said Aurora Alcantara, 18. "There's no cholos 
around like years before, no fights, no noise at night." 
</P>
<P>
 The court order follows successful efforts by Los Angeles and Burbank to use 
injunctions against gangs. In Los Angeles, a judge has upheld two separate 
convictions against a gang member arrested under terms of its injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 In Norwalk, gang members denounce the city's action as unnecessary and 
complain about overzealous sheriff's deputies harassing and humiliating them at 
every turn. Some say they cannot leave their homes without being stopped, 
searched and photographed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being picked on," said one gang member. "I don't like the feeling 
of being up against the car for no reason. People think you're a criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Locos member, also 19, put it this way: "They stop us for any reason. 
All of a sudden, they want to kick everybody out." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Larry Anderson, the sheriff's liaison to the city, said the deputies are 
just doing their job to keep the neighborhood safe. 
</P>
<P>
 But parents of gang members question why their sons are being singled out when 
larger gangs are wreaking havoc in other parts of the city. The Locos gang, 
with about 60 members, is one of the smallest of 11 gangs in Norwalk, which has 
an estimated 2,500 gang members in all. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents also complain that their sons have been wrongly named in the 
injunction. "He don't do drugs. He don't shoot guns. He don't hang out in 
alleys," one mother said of her son. "But he gets stopped on weekends. It 
upsets me. He was raised here." 
</P>
<P>
 The city, parents say, has overstated the problem and failed to recognize that 
gang members are responsible young men working hard to improve their lives. 
"These kids are very bright," said Steve Estrella, whose two sons, ages 18 and 
20, are named in the injunction. "They're getting a raw deal." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they decided to target the Locos because of the severity of 
incidents, including the two recent firebombings. Gang members had become 
increasingly defiant in recent years, even throwing rocks and bottles at 
sheriff's deputies patrolling the area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Depictions of day-to-day life in the Orange Street area are as varied as the 
descriptions of gang members themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, residents and city officials point to signs of trouble such as 
wrought-iron gates in alleys meant to keep gang members from painting graffiti 
on walls and breaking into vacant buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the gang members named in the injunction already are behind bars or in 
juvenile facilities for offenses ranging from drinking in public to armed 
robbery. Another Loco, 19-year-old George Chavez, was sentenced last month in 
Norwalk Superior Court to five years in state prison for the two firebombing 
incidents, which authorities believe may have been drug-related. No one was 
injured either time. 
</P>
<P>
 Locos members, their parents and even residents with no gang connections 
reject violent characterizations of their predominantly Latino neighborhood. 
They speak of a quiet community filled with poor families struggling to make 
ends meet. Some residents say they are unaware of the gang, while others say 
the Locos are friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here 20 years, and I haven't had trouble," said Norman Miller, 69, 
who walks through the neighborhood three times a day. "There are guys walking 
around in baggy pants. I wave to them." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time, about a year ago, when all sides in the conflict were on the 
brink of an understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and the gang agreed to meet. Officials promised summer jobs; gang 
members promised to cool down. The onetime enemies even joined forces for a 
weekend cleanup and picnic where the mayor and Locos leaders laughed and ate 
hot dogs together. But the good will soon fizzled. Gang members say the city 
reneged on the jobs and plans to open a neighborhood schoolyard in the evenings 
so they could play sports. Officials say the gang members failed to show up at 
City Hall to fill out job applications and then refused to cooperate after an 
article in a local newspaper portrayed them as weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members and their parents scorn city officials and -- in particular -- 
the city's director of public safety, Kevin Gano, who orchestrated the 
short-lived truce. 
</P>
<P>
 After the city initiated legal action against the gang in July, Locos members 
painted "GANO 187" on an alley wall -- referring to the state penal code for 
homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Gano said the writing on the alley wall, which has since been removed, did not 
bother him. He has encountered no trouble on recent visits to the neighborhood. 
"They had to lash out at somebody," Gano said.  
</P>
<P>
 Norwalk officials say they are still willing to hash out differences with the 
gang. But Gano and other officials are exuberant at the apparent success of the 
injunction, the first obtained under a year-old pilot program involving the 
district attorney's office and Norwalk. Now they are thinking of seeking 
injunctions against other gangs. Courting Peace Norwalk officials are using an 
injunction to crack down on a gang accused of terrorizing a small neighborhood. 
The court order prohibits Orange Street Locos members from blocking streets, 
trespassing on private property and carrying baseball bats and crowbars, within 
a 20-square-block area around Orange Street.

STATE PANEL TO DISCUSS L.A. SUBWAY PROBLEMS; TRANSIT: SENATE COMMITTEE WILL 
MEET NOV. 2 IN LOS ANGELES TO EXAMINE THE TROUBLED PROJECT. FEDERAL FUNDING HAS 
ALREADY BEEN HALTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that state government needs to better protect California taxpayers' 
investment in the Los Angeles subway, the chairman of the state Senate 
Transportation Committee has scheduled a hearing to examine problems with the 
project's construction and management. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is the latest outside inquiry into the project, which already has 
come under scrutiny from the federal government and Los Angeles city officials. 
Federal officials last week said they would not provide any more money for 
tunneling -- halted since Aug. 18 -- until they are convinced that local 
officials can competently manage subway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has provided about $250 million, the largest source of funding after 
the federal government and local sales tax revenues, for the 
multibillion-dollar project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state has an indispensable interest in how, and in what manner, the money 
is spent," said Sen. Quentin L. Kopp, the committee chairman. "There's no 
question that it's alarming to observe the errors that have already been made 
in the construction." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman, chairman of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority, said he sees no need for the state hearing but 
expects the transit agency to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to put our own house in order," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp, an independent from San Francisco, said the ouster Tuesday of the Los 
Angeles subway project's construction president does not go far enough. "I'm 
very much concerned," Kopp said, adding that "exposure" through public hearings 
can help remedy what he sees as systemic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate hearing will be Nov. 2 in Los Angeles. Kopp said he scheduled the 
hearing at the request of Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), a member of the 
transportation committee.  
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation 
Committee, said he also plans to quiz MTA officials at his next committee 
hearing Oct. 24 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the Legislature created the MTA, we certainly have an obligation to 
follow through with oversight," said Hayden, who attended the MTA board meeting 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden and Katz have threatened to introduce legislation that would abolish 
the MTA's subsidiary agency, the Rail Construction Corp., if the MTA fails to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who sits on the MTA board 
but is vacationing in Europe, transit directors postponed a vote this week on 
whether to dissolve the subsidiary. The Rail Construction Corp. was formed to 
take over subway construction in 1990 from the former Southern California Rapid 
Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
 The RCC has been criticized as being too receptive to Metro Rail contractors. 
County Supervisor Gloria Molina, among others, has said that the construction 
corporation needlessly dilutes the authority of the MTA board, of which she is 
a member. 
</P>
<P>
 One former board member of the construction corporation, James Pott, said in 
an interview Wednesday that he agrees with Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see no reason for the continuation of the RCC," said Pott, retired chief 
engineer for the city of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders of the construction corporation, including Councilman Richard 
Alatorre, said that final decision-making authority always has rested with the 
MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what else we want in terms of accountability that we don't have 
now," said Alatorre, an MTA board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the shortcomings that have come to light on the project, Kopp said, 
the MTA should fire its construction inspection firm, Parsons-Dillingham. The 
firm has defended its performance and last week alleged that the construction 
contractor building the troubled tunnels along Hollywood Boulevard and Vermont 
Avenue deliberately concealed defective work from inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin E. White, the MTA's chief executive officer, has announced that he 
wants to phase out Parsons-Dillingham from its role in supervising the 
extension of the subway to Universal City and North Hollywood and is evaluating 
whether termination is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp said more sweeping action is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Temporizing, in my experience, is not successful," Kopp said, referring to 
his tenure as a board member of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, which 
oversaw the building of that region's rapid-transit system. 
</P>
<P>
 White was expected today to announce an interim replacement for Edward 
McSpedon, whom he ousted Tuesday as RCC president.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COLUMBUS' ARRIVAL BEGAN 
EPOCH OF DEATH, SAYS NATIVE AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the 502nd anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus, John 
Funmaker, a Native American from the Winnebago tribe, told 200 people in San 
Pedro Wednesday that the day marked the beginning of an epoch of death and 
destruction of native people. 
</P>
<P>
 Funmaker urged President Clinton to publicly concede that the United States 
committed systematic acts of genocide against Funmaker's Native American 
forefathers. 
</P>
<P>
 Native Americans still are struggling to find their identity and regain their 
dignity in a country whose classrooms continue to teach a lie, said Funmaker, 
who is executive director of Iron Circle Nation, an organization representing 
about 50 tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 And he declared that from now on, Iron Circle Nation -- established in 
Southern California six years ago -- will recognize Columbus Day as Native 
American Truth Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Iron Circle Nation pledges to continuously expound the truth worldwide, that 
the bodies of our ancestors were silenced in bloodshed and 'America the 
Beautiful' committed a genocide of our people, from sea to shining sea," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks were made in a ceremonial circle on a cliff at Angels Gate in San 
Pedro, kicking off an annual five-day Gathering of the Elders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not bashing Columbus," Funmaker said. "We just want to get a positive 
message out that despite the genocidal practices on our people, we have 
survived and we have something to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering was a spiritual celebration of nature and the land, demonstrated 
with several rituals and an Aztec dance by the group Cacheauto. 
</P>
<P>
 The thudding of drums and dancers' feet represented the heartbeat of the 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders from the Gabrieleno tribe, whose members were among the earliest 
inhabitants of Southern California, spoke of the need for people of all races 
to come together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all from Mother Earth. It doesn't matter what color you are or what 
language you speak," said Chief Vera Rocha. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceedings were watched by a crowd of fellow Native Americans, African 
Americans, Asians and whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the gathering were several elders from Big Mountain, the Navajo 
reservation in Arizona where Native Americans continue to fight a 
government-ordered relocation of thousands of families resulting from a 1974 
partitioning of reservation land. SUSAN WOODWARD

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BRISENO 
SUES CITY, ALLEGES IT DID NOT PROVIDE DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles police officer Theodore J. Briseno sued the city of Los 
Angeles on Wednesday, alleging it failed to provide him a defense in the 
criminal, civil and administrative proceedings stemming from the Rodney G. King 
beating.  
</P>
<P>
 Briseno, fired from the force for kicking King, claims in his federal lawsuit 
that the city retaliated against him for comments he made after the March 3, 
1991, videotaped beating of King in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was "quick to point fingers, leaving its own dedicated employees 'out 
to dry,' so to speak, by refusing to provide a . . . required defense," 
according to his lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Don Vincent, who handled the claims against the city in the 
federal civil trial, had not seen the complaint, but said "the city paid for 
his representation" during the trials.  
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiff claims that "at no time during the trials concerning Officer 
Briseno did the city provide for his defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit names ex-Chief Daryl F. Gates, Chief Willie L. Williams and eight 
LAPD officials involved in the Board of Rights hearing that eventually led to 
the officer's firing by Williams.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; DIABETIC 
REJECTED FOR FEDERAL JOB SETTLES SUIT FOR $67,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Long Beach man who was turned down for a federal job because he is diabetic 
has settled his lawsuit against the government for $67,000, bringing to a close 
what advocates call a landmark case for people with diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 After having his application for a special agent position with the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms turned down because of a Treasury Department 
policy against hiring diabetics as special agents, Ken Dugger sued the federal 
government in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulation disqualifying diabetics from positions as special agents -- who 
are considered law enforcement personnel -- was changed in 1993, after Dugger's 
suit was filed. It now allows for individual evaluation of diabetics. 
</P>
<P>
 Dugger was given the settlement by the Treasury Department, which also agreed 
to bolster his retirement pay to a level equivalent to what it would be if he 
had been hired as a special agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Dugger, a swimming instructor and mountain climber who has a black belt in 
karate and has worked for the government since 1988, said he was heartened by 
the outcome of the case. "You have a right to be assessed on a case-to-case 
basis, as an individual, rather than as a class," said Dugger, 33. "If you're 
diabetic, you can do whatever job you want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen L. Wishner, president of the American Diabetic Assn., said the 
organization is trying to remove automatic restrictions against diabetics 
seeking to fly planes or operate a truck in interstate commerce. She said there 
are an estimated 14 million Americans with diabetes.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LAKE VIEW TERRACE; 
SLAYINGS OF 2 MEN BELIEVED DRUG-RELATED, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men whose bound and gagged bodies were found near Lake View Terrace on 
Saturday were strangled, and detectives believe the killings were drug-related, 
a sheriff's spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The clothed bodies, wrapped in plastic trash bags, were discovered by a hiker 
in a gully near North Lopez Canyon Road about 9:45 a.m. Saturday, said 
sheriff's spokesman Brian Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the victims, a 25-year-old man, was identified but his name was 
withheld pending notification of his relatives, Jones said. The identity of the 
second man, who is thought to be in his 20s, is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives believe the men, who were bound and gagged with brown packaging 
tape, probably were killed before their bodies were dumped in the gully, Jones 
said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SUSPECT 
SEIZED IN CARJACKING AFTER MAN RETURNED BABY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man suspected of stealing a car with a 4-month-old girl in the back seat, 
then leaving the infant on a doorstep a short time later, was arrested today at 
the end of a police chase. 
</P>
<P>
 The carjacking occurred about 1:30 p.m. at a Union 76 station at Robertson 
Boulevard and 3rd Street, said Los Angeles Police Detective Raymond Futami of 
the Wilshire Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Terrell Evans, 27, of Culver City was arrested about 6:30 p.m. Police 
followed the signal from an electronic locating device built into the car to 
find the white BMW near 54th Street and 11th Avenue, said Los Angeles police 
spokeswoman Sandra Castello. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans allegedly led police on a chase to Centinela and Field avenues in 
Inglewood, where he was arrested, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday afternoon, the baby's mother, Karen Clark, expressed gratitude to the 
man for not hurting her child or husband, who had tried to stop the man from 
leaving in the BMW. Clark said she could "live without the BMW. I can't live 
without my daughter."AUTOMOBILE

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WHITTIER; EX-SEN. HILL, 
AIDE REPORT TO FEDERAL PRISON CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former state Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) reported to the minimum-security 
federal prison camp near Boron on Wednesday to begin serving a 46-month 
sentence on political corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Also reporting to the desert encampment was Hill's co-defendant, former 
legislative aide Terry E. Frost, who began a 21-month sentence.Hill was found 
guilty of extortion, conspiracy and money laundering for taking a $2,500 
payment from an undercover FBI agent in 1988. Frost was found guilty of 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The isolated camp, where temperatures can reach 110 degrees in summer, is also 
home to ex-Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who has served more than four 
years of a six-year sentence after his separate conviction on corruption 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 All three men were caught up in an FBI sting operation in which federal agents 
masqueraded as Southern businessmen seeking to buy influence in the 
Legislature.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CONFUSING BALLOTS WON'T 
BE REPRINTED, OFFICIALS SAY; ELECTION: PUNCH-CARD FLUKE RAISES WORRIES THAT 
SUPPORTERS OF PROPOSITION 187 MIGHT VOTE FOR SMOKING MEASURE, PROMPTING CALLS 
FOR A REVISION.

 Local election officials are under fire for issuing what critics say is a 
confusing ballot that could adversely affect at least two statewide 
propositions, but the officials said Wednesday the ballots would not be 
reprinted because that could cost millions and possibly delay voting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the limited time frame, (if) we would have to try and reprint the 
ballots, it would be virtually impossible without severely jeopardizing the 
orderly conduct of the election," said Marcia Ventura, spokeswoman for the 
registrar-recorder's office. "The indications are, we couldn't do it in time." 
</P>
<P>
 The county uses a computer-generated numbering system that assigns each "yes" 
and "no" hole a number. The controversy surrounds the numbering of the "yes" 
and "no" votes for Proposition 188, a smoking-related measure primarily funded 
by tobacco giant Phillip Morris USA. 
</P>
<P>
 On most of the county's punch-card ballots, each hole is numbered, and by pure 
coincidence, a "yes" vote on Proposition 188 is hole number 187; a "no" vote is 
hole number 188. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the smoking initiative worry that supporters of Proposition 187, 
which seeks to deny illegal immigrants public schooling, social services and 
most health care, might inadvertently vote for Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a mistake to take lightly," said Paul Knepprath, a spokesman for 
the Coalition for a Healthy California, the campaign against Proposition 188. 
"This is something that can confuse voters and lead them to vote in a way they 
don't want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188 foes want the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to order 
the registrar-recorder's office to renumber the ballots to avoid confusion. The 
board listened to their pleas Tuesday but took no action on the request. The 
group plans to renew their demands next week, members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller told the board that he felt the ballots 
could be confusing. However, Miller declined to predict how the county ballots 
might affect the results of the Nov. 8 election. Under state law, it is up to 
local officials to decide whether to rectify the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 County election officials contend that the fluke poses no serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on our past experience, we don't think this will be confusing for 
voters," said Ventura, adding, "To put on an election in an election year costs 
about $12 million, and the ballots are a good part of that."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY ASKS 
MORATORIUM ON QUAKE FORECLOSURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council asked President Clinton and Gov. Pete Wilson on 
Wednesday to declare a one-year moratorium on foreclosures of buildings damaged 
in the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are being pushed out," said Councilman Hal Bernson of 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson wants the President and governor to direct federal and state banking 
regulators to tell lenders not to foreclose on any damaged properties involving 
owners who were in good financial standing before Jan. 17.  
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's staff could not provide statistics on the number of troubled 
properties, but he believes it is in the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman is seeking a moratorium retroactive to Oct. 1 for owners who 
are actively applying for funding to cover the cost of repairs.  
</P>
<P>
 Many property owners are getting hit with a double whammy, he said, because 
the Internal Revenue Service expects them to pay taxes on the original loan 
amount, rather than the foreclosed value.

PRISONERS OF FEAR; FOR SOME ELDERLY, VAN NUYS SLAYINGS ARE REMINDERS OF 
VULNERABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's strange, Grace Salerno says now, how the cozy old Van Nuys house where 
she has lived for 42 years could turn into such an ominous place -- just 
another modest urban house where danger now inhabits the dark corners and empty 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this was home , the place where she and her late husband, Joseph, 
raised their two daughters, God-fearing parents who watched black-and-white 
television on warm summer evenings, lying in bed at night, talking about the 
day's events and how much they loved one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Joseph is gone, the girls have moved away, and the nights are different: 
the 75-year-old Salerno lies awake at night with a .22-caliber pistol under her 
pillow, in terror of having to fight off an intruder. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, as she ate lunch with scores of other elderly diners at the 
Bernardi multipurpose senior center, she talked about how her fears have grown 
since two elderly Van Nuys women were killed in the past four days, apparently 
by burglars. 
</P>
<P>
 Berneda McMackin, 77, was found beaten to death Sunday in her smoke-filled 
home. Two days later, 72-year-old Aliza Levi was killed when she apparently 
startled a burglar shortly after her husband left their Norwich Avenue home to 
run errands. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police say the killings are unrelated, aging widows like Salerno say 
the crimes are a cruel and sober reminder of the dangers of being old and alone 
in a big city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It scares me to death to go to bed now," the retired nurse said over a roast 
beef and cabbage lunch. "I lay there with my knees knocking, wondering if I'll 
ever have the courage to use that gun if someone comes for me in the darkness. 
I pray to God that I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, scores of elderly Van Nuys residents gather at the senior center for 
lunch, parties and social affairs. But at 4 p.m., when the center closes its 
doors, many return to all-too-quiet homes now devoid of spouses, children and a 
sense of safety. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the elderly version of "Home Alone." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know which door to go in," said 74-year-old widow Margaret 
Vreeland, who has twice been mugged on the street since her husband died in 
1971 and bears the scar where two thieves cut her with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live alone. It's just me and my little doggie, Little Bit. She barks like 
the dickens whenever anyone comes near the house. But she's old, 15 years old 
now. I know I'm going to lose her someday soon. And I don't know what I'll do 
then." 
</P>
<P>
 Center Director Sabella Richardson says the killings haven't come up much in 
conversations at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come to forget their troubles," she said. "But we have a lot of 
elderly women here, a lot of them. And they live alone. I can't see why the Van 
Nuys police aren't here telling these people how to better protect themselves 
at home. I mean, how can they do that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Habif has seen the problem: The 76-year-old volunteer delivery man for a 
meals-on-wheels program says he has seen too many trusting men and women open 
locked doors for the flimsiest of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I gotta say is 'meals on wheels' and the door opens," said the 
white-bearded man in a sea captain's hat. "I've delivered flowers, too. When I 
yell 'Flowers!' the door opens. As long as the voice is friendly, they throw 
down their defenses. They should be cautious." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At one of the center's cafeteria tables, 70-year-old Marion Whitley said she 
fled the big city dangers of Queens, N.Y., three months ago. Now, two of her 
neighbors have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me, too," said lunch mate Lucien Farland, 67, a former postal worker and 
sheriff's deputy from nearby Panorama City. "It makes me glad I've got 11 
reasons to keep strangers away. Five go in one gun and six in another. They're 
bullets! And if I hear just one strange noise, I'm up. And, let me tell you, 
I'm a light sleeper." 
</P>
<P>
 In a game of seeming one-upmanship, the two traded urban fear stories: 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many old ladies open their doors without looking through their peepholes 
first," Whitley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not me," Farland responded. "I don't open my door for anyone who doesn't know 
me. And if they can't say my name first, then they don't know me." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitley frowned. "I just don't know, sometimes you can't even go to the store 
or to church anymore, you're too afraid, even in broad daylight! I used to go 
dancing. Now I have an exercise bike right in my room." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Salerno's daughters -- one lives in Alaska, the other in Ventura County 
-- have long encouraged her to move away from the house she now shares with her 
88-year-old aunt Frances, whom she describes as "sharper than any tack." 
</P>
<P>
 But she just can't seem to leave the old house. There are too many memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, though, since Joseph, a plumbing contractor, died, Salerno feels 
like a prisoner in the home she once considered the safest place on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every window has a stick in it" to hold it closed, she sighs. "Every door has 
a deadbolt. There isn't a cross breeze anymore, no fresh air. Frances and I, 
we're a couple of old lady prisoners."  
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, Salerno went to a discount store and asked the salesman for a 
gun "a little old lady could handle." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the weapon hasn't been fired. 
</P>
<P>
 An elderly man from across the table spoke up: "Well, if Joseph were still 
around, he'd protect you. He'd hit them with a lead pipe." 
</P>
<P>
 Salerno's face suddenly flushed with memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said. "My Joseph was a pacifist. He'd never approve of me owning a 
gun. But what can I do? Frances and I are all alone now, all alone."

DON'T KNOW WHO CHI CHI IS? WELL, WELCOME TO THE CLUB; CELEBRITY: SELECTION OF 
VETERAN GOLFER RODRIGUEZ AS ROSE PARADE GRAND MARSHAL SURPRISES SOME, CONFUSES 
OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Chi Chi Rodriguez may not be a familiar name everywhere. But it is one at the 
place where it counted most on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's "a household name in my household," said Tournament of Roses President 
Mike Ward, who named Rodriguez the grand marshal of the 1995 Tournament of 
Roses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez is a senior pro golfer known for his sense of humor and his work for 
children's hospitals and orphanages. Ward, an avid amateur golfer in his spare 
time, said his choice of Rodriguez was natural after he settled on this year's 
parade theme: "Sports -- Quest for Excellence." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Puerto Rico who was born in poverty, Rodriguez made a name for 
himself in golf and shares the rewards of his success with the world, Ward 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, 58, said he hopes his New Year's honor will help make him a role 
model for Spanish-speaking youths. "They can say, 'If Chi Chi made it, I can 
make it,' " Rodriguez said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some people were having trouble identifying Rodriguez, much less 
identifying with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an OK choice. He's a stand-up comedian, right?" asked Alberto Miyares, a 
loft-district artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wasn't he a tennis player or something?" asked Joel Bloom, a Downtown 
shopkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 There was even head-scratching over his name at the Harding golf course in 
Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never heard of him," said Christine Yun, a homemaker out for a morning 
on the links. She quickly explained: "I've only been playing five months." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Delmerico, a movie studio driver who was practicing on a nearby putting 
green, said Rodriguez is a good representative for golf. 
</P>
<P>
 But "if you're not a golfer, he might not be that recognized. Arnold Palmer 
might be more recognizable. Tell them to get Arnie if there's still time," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Delmerico added: "Maybe they shouldn't have someone too recognizable. 
You don't want to make more people interested in golf. The courses are already 
too crowded." 
</P>
<P>
 Other golfers praised Rodriguez as an entertaining player whose work off the 
golf course has benefited thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember him working in the sugar cane fields," said Rudolph Davila, a Los 
Feliz watchmaker who said he caddied in the 1920s -- even before Rodriguez 
started his own golf career by carrying the clubs of others. "I've heard he's a 
good person. They pick movie stars to lead the parade. Why not a golfer?" 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Encee, a Glendale produce manager, said he admires Rodriguez's style. 
"Every time he makes a long putt, he goes like this," Encee said, making a 
Zorro-like move with his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "He takes his club like a sword and then rams it into his bag. He'll add some 
human interest to the parade." 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament of Roses officials said Rodriguez is the sixth sports figure to 
become grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 And Arnold Palmer? He was grand marshal in 1965.

STATE BEGINS AERIAL SPRAYING OF MALATHION OVER SECTION OF CAMARILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State officials began aerial spraying of malathion over a 16-square-mile area 
of Camarillo Wednesday night to combat the state's newest Medfly infestation, 
the first time such spraying has been ordered since a similar outbreak in 
Riverside County in February. 
</P>
<P>
 With a light west wind behind them, three helicopters and an observation craft 
formed a low straight line over the Camarillo Airport before heading north and 
east to begin dropping a combination of the pesticide mixed with corn syrup 
over an area populated by 32,400 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are perfect spraying conditions," said a spokeswoman with the 
California Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Two state police officers stood by as a dozen protesters watched from behind 
an airport fence. Among them were Terri Gaishia and her 13-year-old son, Ryan, 
who stood silently as the helicopters took off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here to make a point," she said. "I find this a gross violation of our 
rights. They make this decision without consulting anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The spraying began less than two weeks after inspectors discovered the first 
Mediterranean fruit flies in an orchard in eastern Camarillo.

Q & A WITH ROGER DALTREY; 'I LOVE PLAYIN' THESE SONGS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People tend to observe their 50th birthdays in special ways, but no one has 
marked the milestone quite the way Roger Daltrey did last February. The English 
singer rented Carnegie Hall for two nights, hired an orchestra, collected guest 
stars ranging from Eddie Vedder to the Chieftains and sang the music that made 
him famous -- the songs Pete Townshend wrote for the Who.  
</P>
<P>
 Now the "Daltrey Sings Townshend" show is on a U.S. tour that arrives at the 
Greek Theatre on Saturday. There are no guest stars on board, but the music 
will be played by a full orchestra and a band that includes Pete's brother 
Simon Townshend on guitar, Ringo's son Zak Starkey on drums and Who bassist 
John Entwistle.  
</P>
<P>
 The Who, generally ranked behind only the Beatles and the Rolling Stones in 
rock stature, last convened in 1989 for a 25th anniversary tour. With Townshend 
having no interest in resuming, this show represents the next best thing for 
his two partners. In a recent interview, Daltrey talked about the enterprise 
and the music it salutes. * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What's the difference between the Carnegie Hall concert and this 
touring show? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Carnegie was a very difficult show for me with all those guests. When 
you warm up to this stuff it's very hard to stop and start. But we needed the 
guests to pay for the show. They were there for the economics of it. It was the 
only way we got pay-per-view, which covered some of the cost of puttin' the 
show on. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did it go from that special event to a national tour? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Some of the songs in that show we'd never played with an orchestra before, 
so the first night we were really wingin' it, and it was a nightmare for us. 
</P>
<P>
 But the second night, when it came together, I thought, "Wow, when it does 
work, this is very, very special." And I thought this would really be good to 
take on the road. Because it is our 30th anniversary. And Pete doesn't want to 
go on the road anymore. It's a shame to let this music just exist on records 
that are owned by a few people. 'Cause when you hear it live it's still as 
fresh as it was the day we first played it. The energy's still there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were you confident that the public would go for it? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, you're never confident. But it doesn't matter to me whether it's 50, 
500 or 50,000 people. An audience is an audience. And I love playin' these 
songs, the band's great. I could re-create the Who very, very easily if I 
wanted to. This isn't the Who, it's something different. People were skeptical 
when the Who went out in '89 with a bigger band. They went, "Oh, it won't be 
the same." But when they actually got to the shows, they found out that it 
wasn't less, it was more. And I think this show is very similar. It's not the 
same. It can never be the same. But it's as good in its own right. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you changed the songs very much? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Some of them. "Baba O'Riley" and things like that are very different. But 
just to hear the music orchestrated gives it a whole different feel. It's much 
more dramatic. And Townshend's music really does lend itself to being 
orchestrated. When they're played by real instruments -- I mean anything can 
sound better than the (expletive) synthesizer -- the music really does gain a 
new dimension. You can only get that depth of sound with an orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What makes his songs special? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think his structures are totally original, where I think a lot of rock 
'n' roll structures are plagiarized. I feel that his honesty in his writing 
takes incredible courage. They're not just glib pop lyrics. There's always a 
greater depth to Pete's writing than the average rock song. It's the honesty 
that takes that amount of courage that I admire so much. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you still regret the Who breakup? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If it was up to me we would have never broken up. It seemed silly. You can 
have years and years off, you can have 10 years off if you want, but why break 
it up? For what? It seems to me we never fulfilled our capabilities. The 
possibilities with the Who were much greater than the things we ever achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up you change, and things change, and it's the staying together that's 
important. You end when you really can't come up with anything else. We ended 
when Pete couldn't come up with anything else. That doesn't necessarily mean 
that the band couldn't have. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what I find sad. It's almost like the baby had got fed up with his toy 
and thrown it away. That's what it feels like. I do respect that he got fed up 
with it, but I can't help but be honest and say that's what it feels like from 
my position. . . . You know, bands are about give and take. And sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It's interesting that so many bands from your generation -- the Stones, 
Pink Floyd, the Moody Blues, etc. -- are still performing and doing well. Does 
that surprise you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not really, no. They're classics. They were the original. Whatever new 
bands are out there, there's nothing like the original, is there? I watch bands 
now that I really like and I watch what goes on with them now. And apart from 
-- I could honestly say -- Nirvana, I find something very, very studied about 
most new bands that you see these days. It's coming from a different place than 
it used to in our day. There's an awful lot more coming from the head than the 
heart.

GOING A ROUND WITH WYNTON MARSALIS; JAZZ: HE'S DOWN ON CRITICS, DISMAYED AT THE

 How do you conduct an interview with Wynton Marsalis? Very carefully. The jazz 
trumpeter and artistic director for Jazz at Lincoln Center has had a long and 
sometimes contentious relationship with the press. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, you don't make too many queries about his brother, Branford, 
leader of "The Tonight Show" band. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, man" is the frustrated response you'll get. "I must have answered 
questions about my brother playing with Sting or being on 'The Tonight Show' 
for the last 10 years. Then, when the so-called critics got tired of that, they 
started saying that I fired my brother. How could I fire my brother if he took 
another job?" 
</P>
<P>
 And reminding Marsalis about his onetime alleged disrespect for Miles Davis 
isn't too hot a topic, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many times," he says, carefully containing his frustration, "do you think 
I had to explain that I was just quoting Miles when I said that he wasn't 
playing jazz? But as soon as I did, there would be another article saying I was 
insulting Miles Davis. But I wasn't insulting Miles. I was just repeating what 
he himself had said about his music." 
</P>
<P>
 Most media, clearly, are not at the top of Marsalis' list of good guys, and he 
doesn't hesitate to engage them directly. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all right," he says, speaking from his apartment on Manhattan's Upper 
West Side. "You can't expect to get into a fight and not get hit." 
</P>
<P>
 In easy conversation, however, Marsalis -- who appears with his septet 
Saturday at the South Bay Center for the Arts in Torrance -- reveals few of the 
unappealing qualities attributed to him by his critics. Although he can be 
unnervingly direct and to the point with his responses, he is an articulate and 
thoughtful artist with a passionate belief in the vital role of jazz in 
American musical history. Described as "arrogant" by observers who have pressed 
him to deal with what he feels are superficial issues, he is deeply respected 
by others, who speak highly of his willingness to "say it like it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with most critics," says Marsalis, a Grammy winner in both jazz 
and classical categories, "is that they'd rather talk about gossip than about 
music. I mean, look at how they deal with rock. Some of them are actually glad 
when they can report that some jazz musician is playing rock music! 
</P>
<P>
 "How can that be? If you're a jazz critic, why would you be glad to report 
that a jazz musician is playing rock? That's a lack of integrity to me. What 
type of loyalty is that to the form of music that these people are supposedly 
writing about?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if the media are the most immediate target for Marsalis, he also has 
several other quarries in mind. Contemporary pop music is one of the most 
important. Several articles have noted his "anti-rap" views. Typically, says 
Marsalis, they have missed the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feelings are not just about rap, but about the whole direction of American 
popular music. Once it switched from an adult base to an adolescent base," he 
explains, "that was a major step backwards. Pop music used to be adult music, 
with adult sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "But since pop made that switch to an adolescent base, it has never been able 
to return, as music, to what it was. And I guess it's understandable, because 
in terms of commerciality, it becomes more successful every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Marsalis, one of the most active players of his generation, sees 
anything specifically wrong with commercialism, or with financial achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not necessarily a bad thing," he says. "But the cynicism that's involved 
with it is bad. How many times a year is the public duped, in one way or 
another, by what's happening in pop? And that's basically the attitude that 
bothers me -- the attitude that you can just give people anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Another important item on Marsalis' list of important jazz issues to be dealt 
with is his continuing battle to establish a working definition for the music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why people make it so complicated," he grumbles. "Here it is: 
Jazz is music that is blues-based, in the broadest sense. And jazz is music 
that has to swing, that has to have a shuffle rhythm feeling in some form or 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 Other items on his list: the undervaluation of education and the deterioration 
in jazz audio. 
</P>
<P>
 As the son of jazz musician/educator Ellis Marsalis, and at 32 the eldest of 
four talented musician brothers (saxophonist Branford, producer-trombonist 
Delfeayo and drummer Jason), the New Orleans-born Marsalis is deeply dedicated 
to the value of jazz education. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not help you get a job," he says with a sly laugh, "but it'll make you 
a better musician if you learn how to improvise and to play some blues. Because 
I feel that if you play jazz music, it develops your total musicianship." 
</P>
<P>
 The usually voluble Marsalis almost becomes speechless when asked about jazz 
audio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man," he finally says, "do you know that when you hear most jazz musicians 
play, whether it's on record or in concert, it almost never sounds as good as 
when you hear them play (acoustically)? That's because there's no real feel for 
jazz in electronic technology." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His list of targets aside, Marsalis has a generally optimistic prognosis for 
jazz. His work at Lincoln Center for the last three years has drawn sell-out 
crowds to his programs, and Center support for his creative innovations has 
been unwavering. This year's program features a weeklong Louis Armstrong 
festival in mid-December, and Marsalis continues to tour -- often as many as 
300 days a year -- around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis' prognosis for jazz critics and journalists -- his favorite target -- 
is far less promising, and he is happy for the opportunity to make one last dig 
at them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear some of these guys say the trouble with jazz is it's too good for 
people," says Marsalis with a little grunt of amazement. "They believe that 
it'll never be popular because people want garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I say, 'What do you mean it's too good for people?' I don't believe 
people want garbage. I've got more confidence in people than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe," concludes Marsalis, "that if you give people something good, 
they'll accept it. Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing."

MODEL OF WEST COAST MUSEUM OF TV & RADIO UNVEILED; MUSEUM: THE 
23,000-SQUARE-FOOT FACILITY IS SCHEDULED TO OPEN LATE NEXT YEAR IN BEVERLY 
HILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The new West Coast branch of New York's Museum of Television & Radio will be 
named after Leonard H. Goldenson, who built ABC into a major broadcasting 
force, it was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference unveiling a model of the three-level Goldenson building, 
which will be located at the southwest corner of North Beverly Drive and Little 
Santa Monica in Beverly Hills, museum President Robert Batscha estimated that 
the facility will attract between 50,000 and 100,000 visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The architect, Richard Meier, also designed the new Getty Center in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Already a presence in Los Angeles with its annual TV festival showcasing 
individuals and programs of the past and present, the New York-based museum, 
through modern technology, now will make its entire collection available to 
visitors at the West Coast facility, which is scheduled to open late next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new building establishes the Museum of Television & Radio as a permanent 
part of the cultural and educational environment in California," said Frank A. 
Bennack Jr., chairman of the museum's board of trustees and president of the 
Hearst Corp. He added that the 23,000-square-foot facility is "a testament to 
the significant role that television and radio play in modern society." 
</P>
<P>
 Batscha emphasized that "the critical aspect is that we are open to the 
public. Anyone can come in." Bennack said that beneficiaries would include 
students and "future practitioners" in the broadcasting field. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Batscha, about $7 million of the $10-million cost of the facility 
already has been raised. Producer Loreen Arbus, daughter of Goldenson, said her 
father had contributed about $2 million. Other major donors who were announced 
Wednesday and contributed at least $100,000 each included CBS, NBC, Capital 
Cities/ABC, Time Warner, the Hearst Corp., MCA, Sony Corp. and the William S. 
Paley Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Paley, the late and longtime chairman of CBS, founded the New York museum. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, it was also announced that "certain areas of the 
California facility will be named for the donors who have made specific 
contributions." For example, "the Board of Trustees Room is funded by Grant A. 
Tinker," former head of NBC and MTM Enterprises. And "the lobby is named in 
memory of Danny Thomas." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on hand for the unveiling was the mayor of Beverly Hills, Vicki Reynolds, 
who said the new facility, first announced in February, was "an appropriate and 
prestigious" partnership between the city and the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Batscha said that the museum site, at 469 N. Beverly Drive, and leased from 
the Bank of America, would be the setting for "exhibitions, screening and 
listening series (and) seminars." He added that bi-coastal events transmitted 
between the two museum buildings would take place. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes the museum a truly national museum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's collection for public viewing and listening includes more than 
60,000 TV and radio shows and commercials. Construction on the Beverly Hills 
facility, which includes a 150-seat theater, radio studio and listening room, 
library and console room, begins in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Batscha said, meanwhile, that this year's TV festival, scheduled for March, 
will be held at the Directors Guild on Sunset Boulevard, ending a lengthy 
association with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

RESPONSE BUILDS FOR THIRD PAN AFRICAN FILM FESTIVAL; MOVIES: NEARLY 60 MOVIES 
WILL BE SHOWN AT THE THIRD ANNUAL EVENT, WHICH BEGINS TONIGHT AT SUNSET 5. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With the third annual Pan African Film Festival running tonight through Oct. 
26 at the Sunset 5, its director Ayuko Babu says, "We feel good about where we 
are. Hard economic realities have made us more realistic. We get a tremendous 
response -- there's a hunger in the black community for this festival, and 
we're getting a lot of white voices on the phone asking for a screening 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 A tall, bearded man of much warmth, Babu, 50, is a local attorney long 
involved in black political and cultural causes. He has good reason to take 
pride in the festival, which this year will offer nearly 60 films and an array 
of special events, in contrast to last year's scaled-back presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's opening will present three outstanding features in separate 
auditoriums at 8 p.m.: Roger Gnoan M'Bala's "In the Name of Christ," in which 
an Ivory Coast village outcast comes to believe himself a new Messiah; Raoul 
Peck's intricately structured "The Man by the Shore," in which the terror of 
Haiti's Tonton Macoutes is seen though the eyes of an eight-year-old girl; and 
Mohamed Chouikh's "Youcef" from Egypt, about an amenesiac Algerian freedom 
fighter (Mohamed Ali Allalou) who awakens to find his country independent of 
France but in the grip of totalitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
 Babu is also enthusiastic about a Black British Film Night (Friday at 8 p.m.), 
which will be sponsored by the UK/LA Festival and will be composed of five 
short films, two of which were directed by Isaac Julien, who made "Young Soul 
Rebels" and "Looking for Langston." 
</P>
<P>
 "Only since 1945 has there been a permanent black community in Britain," said 
Babu. "It's a kind of Afro-Caribbean-British mix, and this offers a different 
take on the black experience. The energy coming out of their films is 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 This year the festival will attempt to bring more than 2,000 students from 
throughout Los Angeles to see one of the 12:30 p.m. daily screenings, The 
first, on Friday, is Isaac Mahibra's "More Time," a film from Zimbabwe 
dramatizing the need for AIDS education. Babu promises that it combines "the 
energy of 'House Party' with a political, cultural and health message." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time he is discouraged that so far, of the 200 letters the 
festival has sent to corporations asking for contributions to pay for 
transporting the students, he has received fewer than 10 responses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although always on the lookout for corporate sponsors, the festival is backed 
by the government of Burkina Faso, Air Afrique and the City of Los Angeles' 
Cultural Affairs Department. As of now, Babu describes the festival's financial 
status as "50-50," meaning that it yields enough revenue to pay for about half 
its costs. Even so, Babu believes, with proper nurturing, he has a hit on his 
hands. 
</P>

MEMORIAL FOR HAWTHORNE ACTIVIST CLARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A memorial service was to be held Wednesday for community activist and former 
Hawthorne city commissioner William B. Clark, who committed suicide last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Clark, 46, shot himself Saturday on the front lawn of his parents' 
home in the 4600 block of Broadway Avenue.He died a short time later at 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, a decorated Vietnam War veteran and former Navy SEAL, had been active 
in city politics for years and was one of the founding members of the city's 
Graffiti and Gang Abatement Committee, said city spokesman Tom Quintana. Clark 
left that committee this summer to devote time to veterans' organizations, 
Quintana said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark's father, Edward, said his son had been depressed and was under a 
doctor's care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has lost a great soldier," said Mayor Larry Guidi. "He was 
hard-working, loyal and nothing was impossible for him."

HELICOPTERS BEGIN SPRAYING MALATHION; MEDFLIES: DESPITE REASSURANCE, PEOPLE IN 
CAMARILLO AREA COVER CARS AND OUTDOOR FURNITURE. SCHOOLS CLOSE DOORS TO 
NIGHTTIME ACTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three helicopters carrying a payload of malathion and corn syrup lifted off 
from the Camarillo Airport on schedule Wednesday night and began aerial 
spraying of a 16-square-mile area to combat the first Medfly infestation in 
county history. 
</P>
<P>
 With a light west wind behind them, the three helicopters and a fourth 
observation craft formed a low straight line before setting off on a three- to 
four-hour expedition spraying the pesticide over the homes of 32,400 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hours of anticipation and planning that preceded the takeoff, schools 
closed their doors to nighttime activities and residents covered their cars and 
outdoor furniture, snatching up free plastic covers faster than growers' groups 
could hand them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after takeoff just before 9 p.m., the helicopters, followed by a 
half-dozen news media helicopters, passed several hundred feet over Hilltop 
Lane, the easternmost edge of Camarillo's eradication zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can hear them, but I am not going out to look, "said David Coster, a 
resident of Hilltop Lane since 1987. "This is the first time we've been sprayed 
for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In Leisure Village a few minutes later, Vernon Kiep, 75, stood in his driveway 
in his slippers and robe watching the helicopters fly overhead. "We went 
through this down in Glendale when we lived there," he said. "I think it has to 
be done." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Gilda, was equally calm about the pesticide spraying. "I used to use 
malathion myself to spray my trees," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Streets throughout the community were empty as the helicopters flew back and 
forth over the neighborhood. The mixture left a sweet smell in the air and 
clear visible droplets on vehicles. Few cars were parked on the street and most 
of those were covered with plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Giesler, 74, left her gray Hyundai unprotected. "I figure I'm going to 
have so many problems that that little car's not going to matter that much," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's the best thing in the world but I don't think it can be 
avoided," she said. "The only thing I'm sorry about is that it's going to last 
six months. That means a lot of work for me." 
</P>
<P>
 At Harley's Camarillo Bowl on the edge of the spray zone the crash of bowling 
pins drowned out the sound of helicopters overhead. Wednesday nights are 
usually busy, said Chris Fazio, but the spraying kept people home. Only three 
of 20 lanes were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dead," Fazio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spraying Wednesday was the first of 10 to 12 such aerial sprayings 
scheduled over the next six months to combat the infestation and save the 
county's lucrative citrus sales to Japan. It began less than two weeks after 
the first of 63 Medflies were discovered in an orchard on the grounds of St. 
John's Seminary in eastern Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 At the airport, about a dozen demonstrators turned out to protest the 
spraying. Two state police officers stood by to ensure there were no 
interruptions. Among the protesters were Terri Gaishia and her 13-year-old son, 
Ryan, who stood silently watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here to make a point," she said, an anti-spraying sign pinned to her 
lapel. "I find this a gross violation of our rights. They make this decision 
without consulting anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, anxious parents tried to determine how best to protect 
their children from exposure to the pesticide the morning after. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Wilcox, a Santa Rosa Valley resident, said she was upset to find that 
park and recreation officials did not plan to cover playground equipment at 
nearby Heritage Park, where her sons play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids play and then they put their hands in their mouths," she said. After 
she appealed to the Pleasant Valley Parks and Recreation District, district 
officials agreed to provide plastic tarps to cover the equipment if she would 
be responsible for the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got some neighbors together and we covered it," she said. "But it really 
disturbs me. I don't feel the kids were taken into consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 She and other parents also complained that the Pleasant Valley School District 
did not plan to cover outdoor facilities, but intended only to wash off outdoor 
drinking fountains, playground equipment and lunch tables. 
</P>
<P>
 But school district officials, on advice from the county superintendent of 
schools and Public Health Officer Dr. Gary Feldman, said the precautions were 
sufficient to protect children. 
</P>
<P>
 "My utmost concern is the health and safety of students and staff in the 
affected areas," said Supt. Charles Weis. 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Health Services officials have said that at the 
concentrations used -- 1.2 ounces of malathion to 10.8 ounces of corn syrup 
bait per acre -- there are "no significant health effects" for most people. But 
state and local health officials have warned that people who have respiratory 
problems such as asthma, as well as the very young and the very old could be 
more susceptible to adverse effects from even minimal exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said anyone who believes he or she is experiencing adverse effects 
from malathion exposure should call the Cooperative Medfly Project hot line at 
1-800-491-1899. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot line officials said they had received more than 1,000 calls by Wednesday 
evening. They said they will be answering the phones again from 7 a.m. to 5 
p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the questions centered on the effects of malathion, officials said. 
But from today on, if callers are reporting health problems, hot line staff 
will determine symptoms, length of exposure and whether the caller has seen or 
should see a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 That information will be forwarded to the state Department of Health Services 
and reviewed by a toxicologist. The toxicologist will compile the data as part 
of a statistical health study, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To educate local physicians, Feldman mailed 1,500 information packets to 
Ventura County doctors Friday, including forms for reporting any cases of 
suspected pesticide poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past 10 days, Feldman said, his office has received 20 to 30 phone 
calls a day from concerned residents and a few physicians. Several 
pediatricians in the Camarillo area called to ask about the effects of 
malathion on children. 
</P>
<P>
 During the series of aerial sprayings in Corona that began in February and 
concluded in May, about 250 residents reported suffering skin rashes, allergic 
reactions and other symptoms and two doctors submitted Pesticide Illness Report 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman offered reassurances again Wednesday that the amount of malathion 
being dispersed per acre is too small to pose a significant health risk to the 
general public or to pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dose is everything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dose proved too much for some in Riverside County, Corona resident 
Valerie Dufresne told a group of about 15 opponents of the spraying gathered at 
an east Camarillo home on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she already had health problems, she left town during each of the 
spraying episodes. But she returned two to four days later, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out digging in the soil 10 days after the spraying because I used to 
have an organic garden," said Dufresne, who was hooked up Wednesday to an 
oxygen tank she held at her side. Later that day, she said, she developed 
severe leg pain, nausea and experienced confusion and difficulty speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had to use oxygen before that," she said. "I am here to advise the 
disabled of the community . . . those of us with immune system problems, 
respiratory problems, pregnant women, children, are all at risk from 
malathion." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo residents Eric and Beth Fraley, at whose home the opponents 
gathered, said they planned to pack up and leave their rented house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're conservative Republicans," Beth Fraley said. "I can't believe Pete 
Wilson is letting this happen to us." Gov. Wilson's approval was needed before 
aerial spraying of malathion over cities and homes could begin.

HUNDREDS DENOUNCE PROP. 187 IN MARCH THROUGH VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 With less than a month to go before Election Day, hundreds of opponents of an 
initiative that would deny public benefits to illegal immigrants marched 
through Ventura on Wednesday to urge defeat of the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign-carrying, slogan-chanting protesters took to the streets to publicly 
denounce Proposition 187, a sweeping initiative that would deny schooling, 
non-emergency health care and other benefits to people living illegally in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to educate people about the evils of this initiative," said Octavio 
Sifuentes, a Ventura College librarian and one of the organizers of the 
two-mile march from Ventura College to the County Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is divisive and discriminatory," Sifuentes said. "And it makes it look 
like immigrants are the ones causing all of the state's economic woes." 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the Nov. 8 ballot measure say they believe the protest will 
have little effect on voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The California public has already made up its mind," said Steve Frank, 
coordinator of the Ventura County campaign in support of Proposition 187. 
"We're not concerned about demonstrations, we're just concerned about voters 
and in this case the voters are with us." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of groups in the county have publicly opposed the measure, including 
the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, the county Board of Education and a 
host of school districts and other boards. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite such opposition, polls still show the initiative gathering 
widespread support. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, demonstrators set out Wednesday to try to win over voters 
who have not yet made up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Chanting "No on 187," they marched down Telegraph Road and took a right turn 
on Victoria Avenue. They carried signs that read "187, A Racist Proposition" 
and "Down With Wilson, Up With Human Rights." (Gov. Pete Wilson is among 
supporters of the initiative.) More than 300 people took part in the march, 
police estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 A leader in the group shouted, "What do we want?" The crowd responded, 
"Education." 
</P>
<P>
 "When do we want it?" the leader said. "Now!" came the refrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Many motorists expressed support for the marchers by honking horns and pumping 
their fists. Nearby residents came out to view the procession. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Smith and her 9-year-old daughter Sandi sat atop a brick wall bordering 
Telegraph Road, watching the marchers go by. The woman said her family recently 
moved from Arizona to California and knew nothing about the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's neat to see people coming together for something," she said. "It made me 
aware, I didn't know what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Up the way on Victoria Avenue, a truck full of young men flashed a "Re-elect 
Pete Wilson" placard and waved an American flag out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go back home," shouted one. "We don't need you guys," shouted another. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, the demonstrators marched on. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope Holcomb, president of the Oxnard Democratic Club, said she joined the 
march to show that it wasn't just Latinos who opposed the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Proposition 187, after studying it and knowing the details of it, is 
one of the most foolish things we could ever do," said Holcomb, who 
successfully lobbied the Oxnard City Council over the summer to oppose the 
measure, also known as the Save Our State initiative.  
</P>
<P>
 "It goes against everything this country has ever stood for," she said. 
"Instead of saving our state, I think it's going to sink our state." 
</P>
<P>
 In perhaps the most drastic provision of the initiative, illegal immigrants 
would be barred from public education. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish this, teachers and administrators would be obligated to verify 
the legal status not only of students but of parents and guardians, even if 
their children are U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 During a rally at the Government Center following the march, Ventura College 
math teacher Lydia Matthews leaned on a mountain bike that she had wheeled the 
length of the route. She said she wanted to support her students taking part in 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Want to know what my favorite sign is?" she asked. She pointed to a sign that 
read, "Keep the World's Children in School, No on 187." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to vote no on Proposition 187," Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 While speakers at the rally blasted the ballot measure -- calling it a 
misguided measure that violates the U.S. Constitution and discriminates against 
nonwhites -- Fidel Martinez and his wife rested in a surrounding courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite aching joints, Martinez said he felt it was important to take part in 
the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are trying to take away our rights," said the 61-year-old former farm 
worker who was born in Mexico. "We need to do whatever we can to defeat this 
proposition. I know I'll vote against it."

BALLPARK WOULD NOT PAY ITS OWN WAY, EXPERT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Politicians from Oxnard, Ventura and Camarillo expressed support for a 
proposed minor league ballpark Wednesday, despite an experienced consultant's 
admission that the $15-million stadium would never pay for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 In a smooth presentation that included a speech by former major league pitcher 
and Santa Paula native Jim Colborn, consultants pitched the merits of the 
5,500-seat ballpark to a roomful of council members and city officials in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County stadium would be as successful as heralded minor league 
ballparks in Rancho Cucamonga and Lake Elsinore, attracting about 340,000 fans 
a year -- a near sellout every game, said Dan Young, president of the Spectrum 
Group, an Irvine-based sports consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked if the stadium would ever pay for itself, Young said the 
ballpark's revenues would only cover operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he gave an honest answer," said Ventura Mayor Tom Buford. "The answer 
is no, and that is something we have to look at."  
</P>
<P>
 A committee of city leaders is recommending that the three cities form a joint 
powers authority to pay for the stadium, which could be ready by the 1996 
baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
 Under such a plan, the cities would guarantee bonds for the construction and 
would ultimately be responsible for paying off the debt on those bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Gagliardi, president of the California League, promised in the spring to 
deliver a Class A team to the county if someone built a stadium. The three 
cities formed a committee in March and have spent $85,000 to study the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The three councils will decide whether to proceed with the plan next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, who did not attend the presentation, said the city 
has more important things to spend taxpayers' money on than baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would personally find it very difficult to commit city funds to build a 
stadium, or any part of it," Lopez said. "I think there are more important 
priorities. We have streets that need to be repaired." 
</P>
<P>
 But most council members at the meeting said they backed the plan to bring a 
Class A team to western Ventura County, citing the lack of family entertainment 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's obvious that it's not going to pay for itself," said Oxnard 
Councilman Andres Herrera. "We need to look at this as a public venue that is 
going to provide entertainment to the community."  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's last Class A team, a Toronto Blue Jays affiliate called the 
Ventura Gulls, played one season in 1986 and left for San Bernardino after 
failing to attract enough fans.  
</P>
<P>
 "We played at (Ventura College), all day games, with no beer," said Colborn, 
who co-owned the club. "We promoted it poorly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the three city councils agree to form it, the Tri-Cities Sports Authority, 
as the joint project would be named, would own and operate the ballpark and 
share all costs and profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really the way to go," said Young. "It's intelligent financial 
planning."  
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the cities expect to start negotiating with Class A teams next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 A stadium site is expected to be chosen from four locations in the three 
cities on Oct. 27. Haggling is expected between landowners and city officials 
over land donations and the tax breaks or development concessions the cities 
would grant in return. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month the committee ranked a site near the Ventura Auto Center as the 
best location, but a last-minute offer of free land by a Camarillo owner -- 
deemed too good to ignore -- threw a curve into the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of the new site, located near the Camarillo Airport, have offered 
to donate about 25 of the 35 acres needed for a ballpark, said Camarillo Mayor 
Ken Gose. But in exchange for their land, they are seeking to develop about 140 
adjacent acres, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Not many people offer you millions of dollars out of the goodness of their 
heart," said Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose. "They want something in return." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura council member Rosa Lee Measures said private funds for the stadium 
structure itself should not be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures said she plans to contact five of the county's wealthiest residents 
to see if they would fund the ballpark -- in exchange for having it named after 
them. NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of city leaders from Ventura, Oxnard and Camarillo is scheduled to 
make a final decision on a stadium site Oct. 27. The Oxnard, Ventura, and 
Camarillo city councils will vote on whether to proceed with the plan in Nov. 
1.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CLU ADAPTS 'JUNGLE BOOK' FOR ARTS 
PLAZA 
</P>

<P>
 Rolling across a stage at Cal Lutheran University, Bagheera the panther and 
Serakhan the tiger appeared locked in mortal combat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bagheera, you try my patience," hissed Elisa Johns, the senior playing 
Serakhan in "Jungalbook," an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's classic "The 
Jungle Book" that the school is rehearsing for the opening celebration of the 
Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 As the panther pinned her to the ground, the tiger's furry, fierce mask 
slipped to one side. 
</P>
<P>
 "This mask is going to fall off every time," Johns said, staring up at 
Bret-Jordan Kreiensieck, the sophomore playing Bagheera. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it isn't," Kreiensieck said, efficiently snapping the mask back into 
place for her with a black-gloved paw. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a few kinks to be worked out with the masks, the Cal Lutheran 
production of "Jungalbook" is almost ready for performances Oct. 21 at 3:30 
p.m., Oct. 22 at 1 p.m. and Oct. 23 at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., all at the Civic 
Arts Plaza Forum Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Two private preview performances for the Conejo Valley Unified School District 
are scheduled Oct. 20 and 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jungalbook" tells the story of Mowgli, a young boy raised in the jungles of 
India by wolves. Through the teachings of Baloo the bear and Bagheera, Mowgli 
is protected from harm and taught the ways of the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Barbara Wegher-Thompson said the drama department chose to produce 
"Jungalbook" as a tribute to Jungleland, the animal training facility that 
originally occupied the site of the new Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is meant to be a children's play," said Wegher-Thompson. "The thing is, I 
think it has something for all ages." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning college students into believable jungle animals -- including a 
vulture, a python, a pack of wolves, a hunter and the stern but wise bear -- 
involved months of work. 
</P>
<P>
 The process of building a dozen animal masks, which cover the tops of the 
performers' faces and their heads, began last summer in Lolita Ball's workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball, a lecturer in makeup and costume design with the school's drama 
department, made clay molds for the masks, then poured layers of latex into 
them, one by one. Some, like the enormous elephant head, she shaped with 
balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 When the students returned in the fall, they joined in, painting the masks, 
gluing on fur and adding finishing touches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a fun project because of the level of enthusiasm," Ball said. "The 
students spent a lot of time on the masks because they've had such fun with it. 
Some of them have become terribly attached to those masks." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the performances are available at the Civic Arts Plaza box office 
for $6 each. Those interested can call 449-ARTS. MARY F. POLS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SYMPHONY APPOINTS INTERIM DIRECTOR 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Symphony Assn. has appointed an interim executive director 
until a permanent one can be found to take over the financially strapped 
organization next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Betsy Blanchard Chess was chosen to replace Karine Beesley, who resigned in 
August.Chess, a 46-year-old Ventura resident, will serve until January, 
symphony officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a demanding job, but it is an exciting job," said Felice Ginsberg, 
president of the symphony association. 
</P>
<P>
 Chess takes over during a rocky period in the symphony's 34-year history. The 
musicians, who threatened to strike last month during contract negotiations, 
are scheduled to perform at the new Civic Arts Plaza on Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Future priorities include performances of "The Nutcracker" ballet in December 
and preparations for the remaining five concerts of the 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Chess is responsible for all day-to-day operations of the association, 
including ticket sales, public relations, budgets and making sure the 
musicians' contracts are signed. "We looked for someone who would be very 
strong in a leadership role," Ginsberg said. "Betsy just seemed a natural." 
</P>
<P>
 Chess has been actively involved with the symphony since 1988. She was 
president of the Ventura County Symphony League for two years and is 
chair-elect of the Ventura County Museum of History and Art. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a big job," Chess said. "(But) we believe in what this organization is 
doing, and it is exciting to step in and be asked to help out." TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EXPANSION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AID OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A program aimed at expanding the number of special education students who can 
be taught at school has been approved by the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, a joint effort between county mental health officials and local 
schools, will put four additional therapists in area schools to teach 
emotionally disturbed children who might otherwise have to be taught at 
home.There are six working in the schools now. 
</P>
<P>
 Mental Health Director Randall Feltman said the program needed to be expanded 
because the number of children classified as emotionally disturbed has more 
than doubled in six years to 321 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost of the $170,000 expansion will be picked up by local schools and the 
county, Feltman said. But the county will be reimbursed by the state for its 
share, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The therapists, who can teach about 10 students each, will be assigned to the 
Pleasant Valley, Oxnard Union High, Ventura Unified and Conejo Valley Unified 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors unanimously approved the program without discussion Tuesday. JEFF

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DISTRICT REFUSES TO FUND ELECTRIC CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One man's vision of building an electric car was temporarily stalled this week 
when the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District refused to fund his 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard inventor Ed Young asked the district to spend almost $25,000 of its 
$1.5-million Clean Air Fund to convert a Jaguar XKE to a vehicle that runs 
primarily on electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said he would alter the vehicle to run on 90% electric power and just 
10% on gasoline. But, Young added, it would be a vehicle that consumers would 
accept as a viable alternative to contemporary cars. "People will stand in line 
to buy it," Young told district board members. "It will be built out of 
components that are recently patented that very few people know about." 
</P>
<P>
 But Air Pollution Control Officer Richard H. Baldwin recommended the district 
deny the request because major car manufacturers already are experimenting with 
electric vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe funding this car is going to add anything to the development 
of electric car technology," Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Air Pollution Control District denied the request without 
discussion Tuesday. The panel controls the $1.5-million fund, which was donated 
by a local manufacturer to help find clean-air solutions. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CLOSING ARGUMENTS END IN MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Widely disparate portraits emerged Wednesday in closing arguments of the 
murder trial of a 17-year-old Thousand Oaks boy charged with shooting his 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense described the boy as a troubled youth who believed the gun was not 
loaded when he aimed it at 16-year-old Jacqueline Reay and shot her once in the 
eye in the kitchen of a Las Casitas condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution argued that the boy was a bully and a showoff who did not care 
whether the 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun was loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 A verdict is expected at 11 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged with seven offenses, including murder, the defendant is being tried as 
a juvenile because prosecutors believe he did not intend to kill his 
girlfriend. If convicted, he could be imprisoned until age 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Victor Furio said his client suffers from attention deficit 
disorder and that the charges against him should be reduced to involuntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't know from moment to moment that pointing a gun is wrong because he 
has no common sense," Furio said. "He has no social judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn discounted Furio's argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would bet that everybody who appeared before you between 8:30 and 10:30 
this morning had impaired social judgment," Glynn told the judge. "Nowhere have 
I heard that that is a valid defense for committing a crime." SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; POLICE RECAPTURE TEEN ESCAPE ARTIST

<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-age suspect who slipped out of his handcuffs at the Simi Valley Police 
Station on Tuesday night failed to give officers the slip a second time around 
Wednesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old Simi Valley boy, taken into custody on suspicion of using a 
stolen credit card, had escaped after being handcuffed to a chair in an empty 
report room about 11 p.m. Tuesday, Lt. Tony Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, police staked out Simi Valley High School after receiving a tip 
that the boy planned to meet a student there, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper said the suspect, who does not attend the school, left the campus about 
3 p.m. in a student's vehicle headed west on Cochran Street near Tapo Canyon 
Road. As police prepared to stop the car, the boy fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers Corey Ward and Dan Hampson chased him into the adjacent condominium 
complex, where they took him into custody, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the youth was placed in a holding cell at the station. Police 
expected to take him to juvenile hall in Ventura.  
</P>
<P>
 The previous night, an attendant at a Chevron gas station on Erringer Road 
called police to report a customer who tried to use a stolen credit card, 
Harper said. A patrol officer arrived and took the boy into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, noting that the investigation was continuing, said police did not know 
how the boy slipped out of his handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of the officer who left him alone in the report room was not 
disclosed. GREG RIPPEE

 A new group that runs nature walks to teach schoolchildren about the outdoors 
needs volunteers for a training session Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of history in our mountains," said Debra Brandon, a volunteer 
with the Santa Susana Docents, which started holding nature and history walks 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The training session will take place from 9 to 11 a.m. at the Chatsworth Park 
Visitors Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, with 12 members, has been working with local private schools and 
hopes to expand to 33 public elementary schools in western San Fernando Valley. 
</P>

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; VENTURA MAN SOUGHT IN DEATH OF TRUCKER 
</P>

 Sheriff's deputies were searching Wednesday for a Ventura man suspected of 
driving the car that struck and fatally injured a coast-to-coast truck driver 
who was crossing a Camarillo street to ask for directions, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Antonio Luis-Guarneros, 22, was being sought for questioning about the 
hit-and-run accident Tuesday night in which Robert E. Sullins of Pawnee, Okla., 
was struck in view of diners at El Tecolote restaurant, Deputy Jim Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullins, 65, whose wife had been waiting in the driver's seat of the idling 
refrigeration truck, died at 10:10 a.m. Wednesday at St. John's Pleasant Valley 
Hospital in Camarillo, Deputy Coroner Mitch Breese said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1982 Buick Regal, which deputies said Luis-Guarneros had borrowed from his 
26-year-old brother in Ventura, did not stop after the accident at Lewis Road 
and Barry Street and was abandoned on nearby Durkin Street, Sgt. Mike Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the car with Luis-Guarneros, Wade said, were two men and a woman who work 
with him at a car-stereo manufacturer in Camarillo. Deputies questioned them 
but gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the accident, Sullins and his wife, Mary, 64, had picked up a load of 
green onions near Oxnard and had parked their truck and its 48-foot trailer on 
northbound Lewis Road across from El Tecolote, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Meeks, 40, head waitress at the restaurant, said about 30 people were 
there, including children, when Sullins was struck and thrown into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Wade said, Sullins had sought directions to the Ventura Freeway, 
which his truck had just passed under. GREG RIPPEE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Both serious runners and the not-so-serious will hit the road in downtown 
Ventura later this month for a race to benefit local school libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Roads Scholars Race, the event will be held Oct. 23, with the first 
race to start at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to competitive runners, the race is expected to draw many 
students, including a group of middle-school children who plan to dress as a 
centipede. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's race drew more than 1,000 runners, netting $12,000 for the Ventura 
Unified School District. Organizers hope to raise more this year and to funnel 
all proceeds into libraries at the district's 24 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will include a 10K, 5K and one-mile race. Entry fees range from $10 
to $16 until Friday. After Friday, each fee will increase by $4. 
</P>
<P>
 For information or to sign up for a race, call Fleet Feet Sports at 644-9712.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; OFFICIALS GET LOOK AT MARINE CENTER PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials from the city of Ventura, the Ventura Chamber of Commerce and the 
Ventura Port District got their first look Wednesday at architectural drawings 
for a proposed marine education center at Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, including indoor and outdoor aquariums, would be topped by eight 
five-story copper domes, said Al Fiori, a partner in Rising Hawk Productions, 
the company planning the center. The bodies of the buildings will be a 
sand-like material, to remind visitors of the shore, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conceptually, it's absolutely awesome," Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures said. 
"It will be a world center that's like no other." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for the facility to include an outdoor shipbuilding facility, the 
aquariums, fish hatcheries, an Imax-Cinemax large screen theater and a research 
center for Jean-Michel Cousteau, the son of oceanographer Jacques Cousteau. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Oxnard unveiled plans in July for a 100,000-square-foot aquarium 
at Channel Islands Harbor, and a $16,000 study of the proposal is being 
undertaken. Richard Parsons, general manager of the Ventura Port District, said 
the competing proposal made Ventura officials eager to move ahead quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiori made the rounds Wednesday to the City Council's economics committee, the 
chamber's land-use subcommittee and the Port District Commission, which owns 
the site on which the facility would be built. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiori told the economics committee that he needed another $30,000 to add to 
the $10,000 the city has already spent to fund planning for the project. The 
chamber subcommittee recommended contributing $3,000 of chamber money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to cost some sizable dollars," said Measures, saying public and 
private funding was needed to build the marine center. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to review the plans at 6 p.m. Monday, before its 
regular meeting, and decide whether to commit more money to the project, whose 
total cost is estimated at more than $5 million. IRA E. STOLL

CITY BENDS POLICY ON OPEN SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deciding to break city policy, a divided Thousand Oaks City Council early 
Wednesday approved a wealthy resident's elaborate landscape plan and allowed 
him to build on land reserved for open space. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech that capped hours of debate over Charles Probst's North Ranch 
estate, Mayor Alex Fiore said that on rare occasions city rules can be bent or 
circumvented.  
</P>
<P>
 "City policies are guidelines that, in most cases, are meant to be followed," 
Fiore said. "Sometimes, though, they can be flexible." 
</P>
<P>
 Unique about this case, Fiore argued, is that Probst plans to create an 
elaborate garden of flowering plants and more than 900 trees on his 16 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents argued that Probst's case is also unique because last week he 
pledged a $2-million donation to the city's new Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has prostituted itself," angry former Mayor Larry Horner said after 
the vote. "It's one thing to accept donations, but it's another to do so at the 
residents' expense. This is probably one of the most disgraceful days in 
Thousand Oaks history." 
</P>
<P>
 For Probst -- a reclusive businessman who made a rare public appearance at the 
meeting -- the ruling ends years of wrangling over what he can do with his 
sprawling hillside front yard at Westlake Boulevard and Kanan Road.  
</P>
<P>
 The decision allows not only the landscaping, but construction of utility 
roads and an 1,800-square-foot maintenance bunker on land still designated as 
open space and reserved for native plants such as chaparral. 
</P>
<P>
 City policy prevents any homeowner in the North Ranch subdivision from grading 
or building on the open-space portions of their large parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by family and friends after the vote, Probst quietly expressed his 
relief after the council vote. "This has been a long time coming," he said. 
"I'm very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Fiore in favor of Probst's proposal were Frank Schillo and Judy Lazar. 
Councilwomen Elois Zeanah and Jamie Zukowski opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the city Planning Commission rejected Probst's landscaping request 
because the property's previous owner had promised to leave the hillside alone 
in exchange for the city's permission to build a house on a hilltop. 
</P>
<P>
 Probst was bound by the prior agreement, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very unusual for the city to allow him to build on top of the hill, 
but this was a compromise," Zeanah said. "The benefit to the city was supposed 
to be the maintained appearance of open space. But once the deal was made, he 
no longer wanted to abide by the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Probst was admonished by the Planning Commission for scraping the hillside 
bare. 
</P>
<P>
 Probst's attorney, Charles Cohen, argued Tuesday that the brush may have been 
natural, but it was also a fire hazard. And he asked the council to look beyond 
the past violations and focus on what would be gained by making an exception to 
city open-space policy for his client. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about in excess of 900 new trees," Cohen said. "What my client 
is proposing would be a marvelous addition to the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even some homeowners who opposed the project overall supported the 
landscaping portion of it. Their chief concern was the underground bunker, 
which would hold tractors, heavy equipment, gardening tools and two golf carts. 
</P>
<P>
 Probst, the owner of a Woodland Hills telecommunications company, never spoke 
during the meeting. He sat quietly through the four-hour session, then quickly 
departed in a white stretch limousine. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they had never seen Probst before and knew little about 
him. Arts officials said Probst and his wife moved to Thousand Oaks in 1991 
from the Pasadena area. The couple have purchased eight residential properties 
worth more than $13 million in the Conejo Valley and west San Fernando Valley 
since 1989, property records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Probst bought his 16-acre North Ranch property in 1990 for $1.4 million. With 
improvements, the 21-room home is now valued at $9.5 million, according to 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Probst announced he wanted to contribute more to his new hometown 
and pledged $2 million to the performing arts center over several years. The 
main theater in the complex will be named for him.

AROUND THE VALLEY: HOW CAN MEXICAN FOOD BE BAD FOR YOU IF IT TASTES SO GOOD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I could see the writing on the wall when the Center for Science in the Public 
Interest came out recently with a report condemning Mexican food as just 
slightly healthier than eating lard from the can. 
</P>
<P>
 You know the pattern. First, some busybody research institute plops down a 
report the size of a small suitcase, declaring that something we regarded as 
one of life's little pleasures is really a killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon it becomes politically incorrect, and then socially undesirable, and then 
a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, two of my personal favorites were targeted as among the worst 
offenders: chile rellenos, the report indicated, will plug your arteries like 
Crazy Glue and Mexican rice will bring the Grim Reaper hurtling through your 
door on a skateboard. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not taking this lying down. I won't go quietly. This is my culture, my 
heritage, my lifestyle. (And probably, the reason I can't seem to lose any 
weight.)  
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, supposed to be an alternative: "healthy" Mexican food, with 
age-old recipes given the once-over by caloric do-gooders. Is this stuff any 
replacement for the real thing? 
</P>
<P>
 So I, an experienced Mexican food eater, took my mother, a traditional Mexican 
cook, on a fact-finding mission to two Mexican restaurants -- one traditional, 
one reformed. 
</P>
<P>
 But what started out as a simple food comparison turned into something much 
more important. 
</P>
<P>
 For 25 years, my mom's home cooking was one of the best things about living at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Before every Christmas, she would organize my sister and me into a tamale 
assembly line, turning out enough green, red or sweet tamales for every last 
relative we expected during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 I did the grunt work -- washing the corn husks to cook the tamales in. She 
vigorously kneaded lard into the masa , the dough. 
</P>
<P>
 Lard -- which the report condemns as the worst villain since Darth Vader -- 
made the tamales moist and fluffy. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until a piece of masa would float in a glass of water did she stop 
kneading. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican food was not a matter of calories and cholesterol to us. Making and 
eating it was a bonding ritual. Something passed on through generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Something to be defended. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first dish to investigate was obvious. The study bashed chile rellenos, a 
longtime specialty of my family, claiming that one chile relleno meal so 
exceeded the government's recommended daily limit on saturated fat and sodium 
that it was like eating a stick of butter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my mother made them, she lightly dipped them in egg and flour and fried 
them," my mother said as we talked over coffee at our first restaurant -- 
Lenchita's in Pacoima, where they do things the old way. "So they just had this 
light crust. They make them like that here." 
</P>
<P>
 She conceded that like the restaurant, she too fried the rellenos in lard, but 
switched to vegetable oil years ago after the first reports appeared about the 
perils of saturated fat. The truth is, there is no healthy way to make chile 
rellenos, only degrees of fat content, she pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are made differently in the big Mexican restaurants," she said, giving 
me a knowing look. "The crust of the rellenos are thick and they have to fry 
them longer. That is why they are more fattening there." 
</P>
<P>
 My mom and I rarely agree on much but even I could see she was obviously 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 We also sampled Lenchita's menudo, beef sopes, refried beans and Mexican rice 
-- all cooked in lard -- and delighted in the taste. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really haven't tried cooking anything without lard," owner Fidelina Ruiz 
said when I asked about the potential health risk of the restaurant's 
oh-so-traditional menu. 
</P>
<P>
 But she had a justification ready: "Our customers just like the taste better." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everything is health-defiant at Lenchita's. To walk into their kitchen 
is to walk back in time. The air is filled with the familiar sound of hands 
slapping, shaping masa into tortillas. Corn is cooked in a huge metal pot, 
ground and mixed with water and lime. They place the raw tortillas on a huge 
steel stove top to cook, turning them by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all our traditions are cholesterol-rich, I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Our next stop was the more modern California Taco Bar in Woodland Hills, an 
ultra-healthy version of Taco Bell, and with better-tasting food. Here they 
used the leanest of meat and cholesterol-free canola oil. Most meals are under 
350 calories with a minute amount of fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Black beans, white rice, chicken burritos and shrimp tacos. "I guess it looks 
good if you have never eaten the real stuff," my mother commented under her 
breath as we scanned the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 I nudged her and ordered beef and chicken tacos and pinto beans (I was never a 
fan of black beans, they remind me of Cuban food), and was surprised to get 
full-flavored meat on a homemade tortilla with freshly made salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are good but dry," my mom said between bites. "You can taste the 
difference without the lard." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a record -- I had agreed with my mother twice in a single day. But what 
did I expect when we were confronting an issue that affected us both?  
</P>
<P>
 We came away that day with a greater level of understanding, both of each 
other and the food we eat. I decided that my mother isn't always wrong and that 
she also is one of the best cooks, lard or no lard, this side of the border. 
(Sorry Mom, I'm not getting into trouble with the Mexico City side of the 
family.) 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, she came to the conclusion that the only reason to eat 
healthy Mexican food is if you are on a strict diet.

MAN DISPUTES CHARGE AGAINST WIFE; COURTS: SHE IS ACCUSED OF RAMMING A JACKED-UP 
CAR UNDER WHICH HE WAS WORKING. HE SAYS IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND WANTS TO PAY HER 
BAIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Newbury Park man whose wife is charged with attempted murder for ramming a 
jacked-up car while he was under it said Wednesday that he does not think his 
wife tried to kill him, and he wants to bail her out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after the arraignment of 44-year-old Marcia Burns in Ventura County 
Municipal Court, Jim Burns said he believes the incident was accidental. Burns, 
who works as a mechanic, blamed himself for not doing a better job of securing 
the car before he began working under it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think she did it on purpose. I was under the car, so there's no way 
she could have seen me," Jim Burns, 41, said. "If anything, I was negligent for 
not having the hand brake up on the car." 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors say that at the time of the incident, Marcia Burns was 
planning to move to Las Vegas and became angry when her husband said he did not 
want to go with her. 
</P>
<P>
 At the arraignment, Burns pleaded not guilty and attorney Jean Farley asked 
the judge to lower the bail from $150,000 to $5,000 so her husband could set 
her free. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley, who said Jim Burns could not afford a high bail, argued that Marcia 
Burns had no history of physical violence and could stay with her mother if 
released on a lower bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley also said Marcia Burns would agree not to consume any alcohol or drive 
if she were released until her trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Although unemployed at the time of the incident, Marcia Burns had worked for a 
temporary agency for several months, processing paperwork for victims of the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, Farley told the judge. If released, Burns could get another 
temporary work assignment, Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Ventura County Municipal Court Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. set bail 
at $50,000 and did not comment on the husband's request that the charge against 
his wife be reduced from attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Burns faces up to nine years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies say Jim Burns was working under a car at 1355 Lawrence Drive on Sept. 
23 when his wife rear-ended the vehicle, knocking it onto him. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was treated for a severely bruised left arm at Los Robles Regional 
Medical Center and then released. Marcia Burns fled the scene but was taken 
into custody several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to elude officers, she crashed her car near Ventu Park Road in Newbury 
Park and was then arrested, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officials said she tripped and fell about 200 feet 
down a brush-choked embankment during her failed escape. 
</P>
<P>
 During the arraignment it became clear that the Burns couple, who married on 
Valentine's Day in 1993, have had their share of marital trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 While urging the judge to lower Marcia Burns' bail, Farley said that, if 
released, her client could either stay with her mother or go back to a battered 
women's shelter where she lived for a month last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 21.

VICTIM OF STABBING ATTACK TESTIFIES; COURTS: THE VENTURA VETERINARIAN SAYS HIS 
EX-FIANCEE PULLED A KNIFE AND WOUNDED HIM 22 TIMES BEFORE AN AMATEUR WRESTLER 
CAME TO HIS RESCUE.

<P>
 He was her veterinarian, her lover and then her victim, when she stabbed him 
22 times just minutes after kissing him goodby, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very emotional case," Deputy Public Defender Donna Forry told a 
Municipal Court judge at a preliminary hearing for Jeannette Smith. She is 
charged with attempting to murder east Ventura veterinarian Jeffrey K. Saur, 
her ex-fiance. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony Wednesday, Saur told of first treating Smith's cat, then falling 
in love with the pet owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in love with her, and marriage was definitely on my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith lost her job as a travel agent, the relationship deteriorated, and 
Saur broke off their engagement, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Then six weeks ago, after he had loaded her belongings into a U-haul trailer, 
she lunged between him and her car's steering wheel as they drove on California 
126 in Ventura. "(She) kissed me full on the lips, completely obstructing my 
view of the road," Saur said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Smith's blond hair blocking his view of the road, and her body between 
him and the wheel, Saur pulled the car to the side of the freeway and got out, 
he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized at this point, things were getting too strange for my well-being," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he left the car, Saur said, Smith stabbed him in the right shoulder with 
what was later described as a 4- to 6-inch paring knife. She stabbed herself 
and then wounded the veterinarian 21 more times, including several times in the 
groin area, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saur said he panicked. "I thought, someone get her off me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was rescued by an amateur wrestler from Woodland Hills who was driving the 
same route with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 The towering 25-year-old wrestler, Matthew Halpert, testified that he saw 
Smith standing over Saur, "stabbing him over and over again, whenever she could 
and wherever she could." 
</P>
<P>
 Halpert said he grabbed her from behind in a bear hug and pinned her to the 
ground with a wrestler's move. 
</P>
<P>
 Halpert said that Smith bit him on the wrist as he restrained her. While they 
waited for police, Smith said that Saur "made me do it," Halpert said. She then 
told the wrestler to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary hearing is scheduled to resume at 8 a.m. today.

 HOME FREE -- Facing a 17-count felony indictment alleging embezzlement, fraud 
and conspiracy, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) has become a poster boy for 
Republicans seeking to tar Democratic incumbents with ethical indiscretions. 
Yet even as his name is invoked, "Rosty" appears to be cruising to reelection. 
Despite the accusations arising from the House Post Office scandal, 
Rostenkowski survived a Democratic primary challenge by mobilizing remnants of 
the Chicago Democratic machine and reminding voters of all he had delivered. 
His current Republican opponent, Michael P. Flanagan, presents so little threat 
that Rostenkowski hasn't even opened a campaign headquarters. Flanagan hasn't 
raised much money and Republicans have provided scant help, in part, because 
Rosty has long come through for Republicans as well as Democrats in Illinois 
and is regarded with some affection on both sides of the aisle.

 KITCHEN CABINET -- In the tense moments before her nationally televised debate 
last week with challenger Mike Huffington, Sen. Dianne Feinstein huddled with 
her brain trust -- plus one of President Clinton's leading political advisers. 
Shortly before going elbow-to-elbow with Huffington on "Larry King Live," 
Feinstein gathered with husband Richard Blum, media adviser Hank Morris and 
communications director Bill Chandler over dinner at the Monocle, a favored 
hangout for lawmakers. Joining them was Paul Begala, who helped mastermind 
Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign and has continued to advise Clinton. 
Begala is close to Feinstein's campaign manager, Kam Kuwata, and consultant 
Bill Carrick and has a consulting contract with the Democratic National 
Committee. "When you're in these races you have friends help," Kuwata said.

 STARS AND STRIPES -- Civilians aren't alone in their confusion over the new 
Navy-style stripes that Air Force generals are sporting these days in place of 
the five-pointed stars they wore for years. An Air Force fact-book pictures the 
same new rank insignia for major generals as for lieutenant generals: one wide 
stripe and two standard-width stripes. To fix things, the red-faced Air Force 
brass inserted an errata sheet, showing the correct version for major generals 
-- one wide stripe and one standard-width stripe. In any event, the confusion 
shouldn't last long. The new Air Force chief of staff, Gen. Ronald R. Fogleman, 
reportedly will mothball the controversial new uniforms and return to stars in 
place of stripes.

 NAME GAME -- Remember the California congressional delegation's commitment to 
set aside partisan rancor? Last week the state's lawmakers proved that they 
remain as divided as ever when three California Republicans blocked an effort 
by Rep. Sonny V. Montgomery (D-Miss.), chairman of the Veterans Affairs 
Committee, to name a Palo Alto veterans hospital after Rep. Don Edwards (D-San 
Jose), who is retiring after 16 terms. "It would be more appropriate if 
Congressman Edwards was honored by naming a welfare center for him," Rep. Randy 
Cunningham (R-San Diego) said of the liberal lawmaker. The other two who 
refused to approve the committee action, which by custom requires the unanimous 
consent of a member's delegation, were Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) and 
Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). But Edwards' name may yet live on. Fellow 
San Jose Democratic Rep. Norman Y. Mineta intends to introduce legislation next 
year naming the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge after Edwards.

POST OFFICE PRESSES FERRARO TO REPAIR DAMAGED BUILDING; WOODLAND HILLS: 
OFFICIALS VOW TO HIRE A CONTRACTOR AND BILL THE COUNCILMAN, WHO SAYS 
RETROFITTING LAWS HAVE SLOWED HIS EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U. S. Postal Service has taken on Los Angeles City Council President John 
Ferraro, saying that nine months after the quake, he has failed to make needed 
repairs to a damaged Woodland Hills building it rents from him, leaving postal 
workers worried about their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by the delays in repairs, postal officials are seeking a contractor 
to repair cracked walls and crumbling columns that support steel beams in the 
ceiling, which is being temporarily held up by scaffolding. They plan to send 
Ferraro the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want him to think that we are declaring war," post office spokeswoman 
Terry Bouffiou said. But, she added, "we've gotten to a point where we are not 
willing to wait any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro said he intends to fix the building, but contends that his efforts to 
make repairs have simply been slowed by a new city seismic retrofitting law -- 
a law that he authored. He said he was not sure when the repairs would begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in the hands of an engineer right now," he said. "I'm doing everything I 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing himself to many other landlords struggling to begin repairs, Ferraro 
-- who represents parts of North Hollywood and Griffith Park -- said he has 
already spent about $22,000 to repair the building's quake-damaged air 
conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those postal people are very hard to satisfy," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal officials, however, said Ferraro only fixed the air conditioning after 
sweltering workers complained during the summer heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro bought the property at 22121 Clarendon St. in 1963, but he said he 
doesn't recall the sale price and county property records do not reflect it. He 
built the original post office that year and helped finance an expansion in 
1975. Two years later, he leased the building to the U. S. Postal Service for 
20 years, charging $176,000 a year, according to records and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3.62-acre lot and the 30,000-square-foot building are valued at $2.3 
million, according to property records. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-story building -- which houses 200 or so postal workers -- suffered 
$200,000 worth of damage in the quake. It was closed to the public for several 
days, forcing postal officials to move the operation to a large tent in the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouffiou said city building inspectors declared the building safe for public 
use the week after the quake, but only after the Postal Service paid for 
cosmetic fixes to the front lobby and for installation of the temporary ceiling 
supports. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, from the public counter area, the post office looks modern, clean and 
well kept -- glistening with a fresh coat of red, white and blue paint. But 
lingering quake damage is visible in the cavernous back section, where workers 
sort mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Large cracks run like veins along the walls. Four tall scaffolds line the 
interior, supporting huge horizontal ceiling beams that were previously resting 
their weight on cracked and crumbling concrete columns. One of the employee 
restrooms is off limits because a scaffold blocks its entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouffiou said the Postal Service has been unable to get Ferraro to accept 
responsibility for repairs and has recently sought bids from contractors to 
make the fixes. She said the Postal Service plans to hire a contractor by the 
end of October and pass along the bills to Ferraro. If the council president 
begins making fixes before then, Bouffiou said the Postal Service will halt its 
independent repair plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious that we don't agree (with Ferraro) on this, but we have to move 
ahead," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ferraro said the Postal Service may not understand the complexity 
of his repair effort, which requires the engineer he hired to devise a way to 
meet a new seismic retrofitting law that requires additional reinforcement on 
certain kinds of buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro has voted along with a majority of the council to adopt nearly a dozen 
new seismic safety laws in the past nine months and also authored the ordinance 
that he says now governs repair of the building he owns. 
</P>
<P>
 The post office was assembled using a technique known as "tilt-up" 
construction, an inexpensive process employed on about 2,100 older warehouses 
and industrial buildings in the Los Angeles area. Under the process, 
prefabricated walls were placed on the foundation, tilted upright and fastened 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Because such buildings suffered significant damage in the Northridge quake, 
the City Council in February adopted Ferraro's proposal to require owners of 
tilt-up structures built before 1976 to strengthen connections between walls, 
floors and ceilings to meet modern safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Brugger, chief of the city's earthquake safety division, said the cost 
of retrofitting a tilt-up building is about $1 per square foot. In contrast, 
the cost to retrofit an unreinforced masonry building is about $12 per square 
foot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that expensive compared to other retrofitting ordinances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro's retrofitting law gives the owners of tilt-up buildings a maximum of 
three years to make the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro owns two other rental properties in Los Angeles County that generate 
more than $10,000 annually, according to economic interest statements filed 
with the city's Ethics Commission. Neither of the other rental properties -- a 
condominium in Hancock Park and an auto body shop in Covina -- suffered quake 
damage, according to officials.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; SUSPECTED UNDERWEAR THIEF TO GO TO TRIAL

<P>
 A man accused of breaking into the homes of 18 teen-age girls and stealing one 
or more pairs of underwear from each one's bedroom could be sentenced to up to 
16 years in prison for the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Castellanos, 19, a former Glendale Community College student, is 
scheduled to go on trial Friday in Pasadena Superior Court for 19 burglaries 
police believe he committed over a one-year period.  
</P>
<P>
 Known as the "panty bandit" to police, Castellanos was arrested in April in an 
underwear theft at the home of a female Glendale College student, and later 
admitted to investigators that he was responsible for a spate of other lingerie 
thefts, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the course of the investigation, he told police that this was not the 
first female's home that he had burglarized," said Agent Rod Brooks, a police 
spokesman. Police obtained a search warrant and found a plastic bag with 27 
pairs of panties at Castellanos' Montebello home, along with a list of names 
and addresses of their owners, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castellanos broke into the victims' homes while they were away, entering 
through doggie doors, pried-open windows or sliding glass doors, authorities 
said. He also stole photographs of the girls whose underwear he stole, 
according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Rash, a prosecutor with the district attorney's office, said the oldest 
of the victims was an 18-year-old woman, but most were junior high and high 
school students. She said Castellanos had obtained the names and addresses of 
the members of a girl's soccer team he "had become interested in." 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this young man proceeded to break into each of their homes," Rash 
said. In addition to the 18 charges for residential burglary, Castellanos faces 
a 19th charge for allegedly breaking into an office at the college, she said. 
Each charge is a felony, she said. STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; BOSNIANS SHARE PERSONAL PAIN WITH STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 7,000 miles east of here, the war-torn city of Sarajevo might as 
well be on another planet to teen-agers at North Hollywood High School. But the 
students confronted the carnage there Wednesday when three Bosnian visitors 
shared their heart-wrenching experiences with students.  
</P>
<P>
 The visitors, members of an ethnically diverse theater troupe of Serbians, 
Croatians and Moslems, stopped by the school during a three-week trip intended 
to promote international understanding and cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard Berman (D-Mission Hills) arranged the visit in the hope that it 
would also help promote racial and ethnic harmony in the diverse student 
population. Two years ago, the high school was the scene of a racially 
motivated melee between African Americans and Latinos that had to be quelled by 
police in partial riot gear. There have been no outbreaks since, and the issue 
was never overtly mentioned during the visitors' 45-minute talk.  
</P>
<P>
 Tears came to the eyes of the visitors -- two men, both 33, and a woman, 25 -- 
as they told the students of the losses they and their families have suffered 
since civil war broke out about three years ago in the former Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine talking to a friend like I was, just telling jokes, and he falls down 
because of a sniper," said guitarist Amir (Lazy) Beso, who himself was 
seriously injured by sniper fire. "In a way, unfortunately, you get used to 
it," added lead singer Srdjan (Gino) Jevdjevic. "It's just normal to be dead in 
Sarajevo."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the danger, the theater troupe was formed and has given 70 
performances so far of "Hair," the 1960s musical that celebrates freedom of 
expression. Staged under trying conditions, including shortages of food, water 
and electricity, the play goes on without ever having its location and show 
times advertised for fear of violence. But through word of mouth, it has always 
played to a full house, said troupe administrator Dzenita Becic.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sarajevans' three-week trip to Los Angeles, Washington and New York cost 
about $24,000 and was paid for by the United States Information Agency, which 
brings some 5,000 visitors from other countries here annually, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 95 North Hollywood students who listened to the 45-minute talk are 
from strife-ridden countries themselves and said they empathized with the 
Sarajevans' plight.  
</P>
<P>
 "It reminded me of my country," said Karabet Sungulyan, 16, who is Armenian. 
"I lost relatives in the civil war there." 
</P>
<P>
 But teacher Deborah Bowers-Sherick sought to draw a broader parallel. "They 
said the most terrifying part of war is you get used to violence. Aren't there 
places in the city where violence unfortunately is part of everyday life?" said 
Bowers-Sherick, drawing nods from several students. TRACEY KAPLAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MURDER SUSPECT SENT BACK TO PATTON STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anthony West, whose courtroom behavior has run the gamut from dazed to 
bizarre, was found incompetent to stand trial Wednesday in the 1992 
torture-slaying of a 90-year-old Pasadena millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Candace J. Beason ordered West, 33, returned to 
Patton State Hospital for further psychiatric treatment after a two-day hearing 
featuring testimony and reports from several mental health experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard F. Walmark contended that West was faking 
incompetence to avoid prosecution for kidnaping his girlfriend's father, 
locking him in the trunk of his car and letting him die to cover up an alleged 
$25,000 embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution's expert, William T. Vicary, testified that he believed West 
was faking mental illness, saying he based his finding on the fact that West 
does not act as other psychotics do.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's not genuinely sick. He's acting," said Vicary, adding: "I give him 
credit. He's done a very good job. He's one of the people who has slipped 
through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 But seven other experts have found West to be psychotic, Deputy Public 
Defender Michael Gottlieb said. He added that West's condition does not easily 
fall into the usual psychiatric categories. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Tony is acting, he's better than Brando, he's better than Pacino because 
nobody could keep this up for two years," Gottlieb said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney added that West had been lucid until his arraignment two 
years ago, when he collapsed, babbling, in a corner, then invited everyone in 
court to dinner. He asked bailiffs to pull up his car, treating them like 
valets, according to a transcript. On other occasions, he has wet his pants, or 
fallen limp. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors believe that between Sept. 15 and 18, 1992, West 
kidnaped and killed Louis Molduf, 90, so that Molduf would not press charges 
that West had forged $25,000 worth of checks from Molduf's account to bankroll 
gambling jaunts to Las Vegas.

 Molduf expired after trying desperately to get free, even scratching at the

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; BROTHERS GIVEN LIFE TERMS IN '93 SLAYING

 Two brothers convicted of raping a woman with a baseball bat, kicking her with 
steel-toed boots and fatally shooting her, execution-style, were sentenced 
Wednesday to life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz sentenced Alejandro Verdugo, 
24, and his brother, Daniel, 22, following a brief hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Because prosecutors did not seek the death penalty, the sentence was the 
maximum the law allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The February, 1993, incident provided a brutal end to the victim's difficult 
life. According to a probation report, Suzanne Shapiro, 34, was given to a 
religious cult as a child. At one point, she had been married to the late Max 
Shapiro, one of Elvis Presley's doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been drinking the night she died at the Dugout Lounge, a Van Nuys bar. 
She was accosted in the parking lot, where her body was found the next morning.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; POLICE MUM ON FACTS IN CITY'S 2ND SLAYING

 While the man suspected of shooting a travel agent in her offices last week 
was arraigned Wednesday in Pasadena Superior Court, police remained quiet about 
the facts surrounding Glendale's second homicide of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, funeral services were scheduled for Benita Mikailian, 40, whose 
body was found the morning of Oct. 6 by an employee at her business, Benita's 
Travel Town, at 1110 N. Brand Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Garen Zakarian, 30, of Glendale is being held without bail in the shooting. 
Chahe Keuroghelian, a police spokesman, would not disclose what connection 
police have drawn between the suspect and victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation is still proceeding and we cannot release any details at 
this point without compromising the investigation," Keuroghelian said.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Keuroghelian hinted that police may still be searching for another 
suspect.  
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service for Mikailian is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Saturday at St. 
Mary's Armenian Apostolic Church, 500 S. Central Ave., Glendale, said the Rev. 
Razmik Khatchadourian. Burial will be at Forest Lawn of Hollywood Hills, and a 
visitation will be at 4 p.m. Friday at the cemetery's Faith Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 Zakarian, who reportedly told police he is self-employed, was arrested at 
about 6 p.m. last Friday at his home in the 400 block of West Wilson Avenue in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 While Glendale experienced its highest homicide rate ever last year with nine 
killings, Mikailian is the second slaying victim in the city this year. Earlier 
this year, a 30-year-old man was arrested in the beating death of his 
89-year-old landlady, police said. STEVE RYFLE

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: S. KOREAN TV FILMS LOCAL DRUG PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When officials from a South Korean public television network recently began 
planning a documentary designed to keep their country's kids off drugs, the 
network decided to make the film in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little to film in their country because drug abuse is not much of a 
problem, said Kim Ho Chang, chief producer for South Korea's Educational 
Broadcasting System. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with drugs in America is very well-established," he said. "And 
(Americans) have a lot of experience in dealing with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The crew was in Van Nuys to visit a drug-abuse prevention program run by the 
National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence of the San Fernando Valley 
Inc. As part of the program, 11 teen-agers with drug problems were meeting with 
two officers from the Los Angeles Police Department.  
</P>
<P>
 The South Korean film crew shot footage as the officers, Tom Souza and Vic 
Colello, talked to the youths. The officers -- who encouraged the youths to 
talk and ask questions -- said they hope the youths will learn to trust them. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no sure-fire method to keep kids off drugs, the officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have all the answers for them," said Souza, referring to the 
filmmakers. "We're just trying to work it out as we go along. We're still 
looking for answers." 
</P>
<P>
 While drugs such as heroin and cocaine are not a problem in South Korea, he 
said, some young people are injecting a drug called "Philipon," which he said 
comes from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Kim said, some Korean teen-agers sniff glue, which worries officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the kids who are sniffing glue are causing brain damage to 
themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, Kim said, has begun experimenting with a 12-step program to 
help kids recover from drug addiction, but there is little in the way of actual 
drug abuse prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked after the session if he believes the South Koreans can learn from 
U.S. drug prevention methods, one of the teen-agers in the program, Ivan Luna 
of North Hollywood, said he has doubts. The problem, he said, is that the two 
countries have different cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have the gangs and drugs over there," he said. "And over here, 
it's mixed, you got all the races." 
</P>
<P>
 Another teen-ager in the program, Amanda Vincent of Northridge, had this 
message for South Korean youth: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a recovering heroin addict, and going through withdrawals is the worst 
thing I've ever gone through," she said. "All I can say is don't try it, 
because then you'll want to keep doing it." FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; WOMEN URGED TO ATTEND POLICE EXPO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the goal of increasing the number of female officers in the Los Angeles 
Police Department, the West Valley Division is sponsoring a recruitment expo 
Saturday and encouraging women especially to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently just 15% of the 7,500 LAPD officers are women, but the goal is to 
have 43% of each new police academy class be female, said Officer Patricia 
Guessferd. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is planning to hire 900 additional officers by June, more than 
400 of them women. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last year or so, we've gone out there to . . . let (women) know they 
can do the job," said Guessferd, a 13-year LAPD veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's expo will begin at 8:30 a.m. at Reseda High School, 18230 Kittridge 
St., and include a panel of female officers who will speak about their 
experiences with the LAPD and answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10 a.m., the LAPD written examination will be given to those interested. 
The test takes about two to 2 1/2 hours, Guessferd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants for officer positions must be at least 20 1/2 years of age; hold a 
U.S. high school diploma or GED equivalent; be a U.S. citizen or have filed an 
application for citizenship; be of proportional height and weight and in good 
health, and have no felony convictions. 
</P>
<P>

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; EXHIBIT TO FOCUS ON WOMEN, ALCOHOLISM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two-foot-high portraits of women ravaged by alcoholism will dot the campus of 
Cal State Northridge on Monday, dramatically kicking off National Collegiate 
Alcohol Awareness Week. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-four of San Diego photographer Molly Lowe's works, augmented by 
handwritten tales of each subject's own battle with alcohol, will make up the 
show "Women in Recovery," and begin three days of education on the liabilities 
of heavy drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very, very compelling kind of exhibit," said Carole Baxter, staff 
coordinator of a campus drug-abuse program called Consider Your Alternatives. 
"I think it's visually stunning." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Your Alternatives typically sponsors one day of activities during the 
annual alcohol awareness campaign, Baxter said, but has extended this year's 
program to three days, in part because of a recently released study by Columbia 
University. The report by the university's Center on Addiction and Substance 
Abuse finds college-age women catching up to their male peers when it comes to 
binge-drinking and drinking to become inebriated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought this was a good time to address women and alcohol," Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Monday's show of photographs, numerous activities and 
presentations through Wednesday will be held on the north lawn of the physical 
education building. Tuesday events will include Los Angeles police officers 
conducting field sobriety tests on students who have been drinking, and the 
display of a car wrecked by a drunk driver. Students are encouraged to wear 
black in memory of friends or family killed in alcohol-related crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, representatives of alcohol and drug treatment centers will be on 
hand, and firefighters will demonstrate a tool used to extricate people from 
wrecked cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Women in Recovery" exhibit will be on display from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
Monday on the north lawn, and will then be moved to the student health center, 
where it will remain open to the public through the fall semester. ERIC SLATER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BIKE RODEO TO TEACH SAFETY TO YOUTHS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Blinky the Dancing Helmet," gyrating traffic signals and frolicsome stop 
signs will attempt to inspire children to follow traffic laws and safety 
measures while biking, skateboarding or rollerblading on the streets Saturday 
in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the Safe Moves Bicycle Rodeo taking place at a local Toys "R" Us 
store, children and parents will be treated to a musical revue and stunt show 
designed to add color to important safety rules. If these rules are 
consistently observed, more than 1,000 deaths and 300,000 serious injuries 
resulting from bicycle-related accidents could be prevented annually, the 
event's organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can build an emotional relationship on behalf of children toward these 
symbols, we will be able to educate them by humanizing safety procedures," said 
Pat Hines, founder of Safe Moves, a nonprofit organization working for bike 
safety in Los Angeles County since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "To see kids lay their cheeks on the dancing helmet is the cutest thing you've 
ever seen," Hines said. 
</P>
<P>
 What's not cute, she said, is that four of five bicycle accidents involve 
injuries to the head. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration, only 2% of children under age 14 wear a helmet while cycling, 
which resulted in serious injuries to 20,000 children nationwide last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents who do not require their kids to wear a helmet are guilty of child 
neglect, in my opinion," Hines said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are encouraged to attend the rodeo so they can learn about safety and 
traffic violations they may be committing unwittingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Those participating in the rodeo will attempt to navigate an obstacle course 
that randomly duplicates hazards faced by bikers on an average commute. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will be required to ride, skate or walk through the course that 
includes potholes, railroad crossings and a ferocious dog. They will be asked 
to follow the course without making mistakes such as entering into the street 
from a sidewalk driveway or crossing an intersection on a green light without 
first determining what nearby cars are going to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who successfully finish the course will be given discount meal coupons 
to Jack-In-The-Box Restaurants and free admission coupons for Six Flags Magic 
Mountain, the Los Angeles Zoo and the Children's Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will take place from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Toys "R" Us, 16040 
Sherman Way. Admission is free. For further information, call (310) 827-7896.

PARTY HOUSE TENANT SUES CITY FOR HARASSMENT, DEFAMATION; LAWSUIT: JERRY BOLDUC 
HAS BEEN IN CONFLICT WITH OFFICIALS WHO WANT AN END TO THE REVELRY AT SPRAWLING 
HILLSIDE MANSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Bolduc, master of the revels at the "Party Palace" -- a controversial 
hillside mansion where annoyed neighbors say the fun never stops -- sued the 
city of Los Angeles for $1 million Wednesday, complaining that city officials 
are harassing him and ruining his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are making all these wild accusations about things I haven't done," said 
Bolduc, who also goes by the name "Jerry Bo." 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls that I wanted to date think that I have wild orgies now. . . . After 
all this, who is ever going to rent to me again?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bolduc has been at odds with city officials since August. Councilman Joel 
Wachs and others sided with neighbors complaining that the sprawling 
7,500-square-foot mansion he leases on Wrightwood Drive houses a commercial 
venture where hundreds of people pay admission to attend all-night parties and 
buy drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office brought a lawsuit against the owner of the house 
and the tenants to put an end to the parties. The mansion's owner, Paul 
Campbell, and the mortgage holder on the $2-million house signed a settlement 
agreement two weeks ago with the city attorney's office promised that any 
parties would be limited to 25 guests, wind up by 10 p.m. and serve no alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the settlement, Bolduc said that he, as lessee, was not a part of 
the agreement and scoffed at the curbs. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawsuit against the city asks damages for infliction of emotional 
distress, libel, slander, defamation, trespassing and invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office would not comment on the lawsuit, but spokesman Ted 
Goldstein said: "It isn't surprising. He had been threatening to file it for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 Bolduc said that city officials have conspired to end all merry-making at the 
notorious mansion, and slandered his name in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Bolduc said, city officials "are harassing the hell out of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Vice officers with the Los Angeles Police Department have hidden in the 
bushes, invaded his parties and asked female guests if "there were any drugs or 
prostitution going on," Bolduc said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an LAPD investigation, brought on by neighbors' complaints, that 
culminated in the city's lawsuit, which alleged that parties at the mansion 
resulted in public lewdness, parking problems and liquor and safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the mansion has been Party Central for the past three 
years, which they acknowledge predates Bolduc's arrival. The parties there, 
sometimes attended by skimpily dressed revelers in accordance with themes like 
Lingerie Night, have been covered by MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bolduc moved in last March, neighbors said, hundreds of wild party-goers 
continued to flock to gatherings there. Bolduc contends that only a "handful" 
of parties have been held at the mansion since he has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had only one big party and that was for charity," he said. "Besides, 
we had a city permit." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs joined the fray in September, when he proclaimed that no 
more rowdy parties, loud music or public sex would occur at the mansion.

VAN NUYS STATION ADDED TO TRANSIT STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following a heated debate between San Fernando Valley and South Los Angeles 
lawmakers, the Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to include the Van Nuys 
Metrolink station in a $1.6-million study on transit planning and economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, funded by a Metropolitan Transportation Authority grant, was 
originally designed to focus on the planned development of businesses around 
eight proposed bus and rail transit stations in Hollywood, the Eastside and 
South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a lengthy squabble between Valley and South Los Angeles lawmakers, 
the council voted unanimously to add the Van Nuys station to the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-month study will target low-income communities and create "economic 
development strategies for promoting transit centers as alternative employment 
and community activity centers," according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
 When the study is completed, city planners can use it to decide how best to 
encourage and manage development around each station. The Van Nuys station is 
adjacent to the vacant General Motors assembly plant and several other 
economically troubled businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the station on Van Nuys Boulevard was included only after Valley council 
members objected to being left out of the grant, saying the Valley also has 
transit centers within low-income neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire city needs to be included in this," said Councilman Hal Bernson, 
whose district includes the Chatsworth Metrolink station. He suggested that all 
five Valley Metrolink stations be included in the study, not just Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Hernandez, whose district includes Pico-Union and Westlake, 
countered that the MTA grant was designed to correct deficiencies in the city's 
planning efforts, which he contends have given little attention to inner-city 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had an earthquake on Jan. 17 and now you know what it's like to have 
needs," he said, nearly shouting at Bernson across the council room. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson later withdrew his motion to include the five Valley stations, saying 
he would wait for an expected second round of funding.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 NEWHALL DISTRICT SCHOOLS EARN BLUE RIBBONS; 
MEADOWS: PARENTS JOIN THEIR CHILDREN AND STAFF MEMBERS TO CELEBRATE NATIONAL 
AWARD. A SECOND SANTA CLARITA ELEMENTARY WILL FOLLOW SUIT NEXT WEEK.

<P>
 At a time when good news for public schools is scarce, the Newhall School 
District has a double dose of it to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Meadows Elementary School in Valencia invited parents to the 
school to celebrate its being named a National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. 
Department of Education. This year, 220 public schools in the country -- 
including 26 in California -- received the designation, which is given by the 
agency on the basis of a school's academics, activities and overall curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 No school in the Newhall district has ever before been given a Blue Ribbon 
award. But this year, in addition to Meadows, Newhall Elementary School 
received one. Newhall's students and faculty will celebrate Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating in the Meadows celebration were 840 students who waved small 
American flags, and 200 parents, many of whom were trying to capture snapshots 
of their children. All wore blue ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
 An evaluation by the Department of Education praised Meadows for having an 
environment where students identified "caring" as the most important 
characteristic of staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school climate is such that the warmth and friendliness is felt 
immediately," the report states. "People are sincerely friendly with each 
other. Students are not uncomfortable in school; they like being there." 
</P>
<P>
 Meadows also received acclaim for its strong math, science and special 
education programs. The school's ability to recover from setbacks, such as the 
Northridge earthquake, was also praised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel fortunate we're in this district," said Becky Gearing, a Valencia 
resident with two children at Meadows. "I work with a lot of people with kids 
in the L.A. Unified School District, and nothing there compares to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Reginald Gillins said he and his wife, who is a public school teacher, 
enrolled their daughter in private schools until she reached kindergarten. Then 
they decided to try to give public schools a try. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest with you, we're a little disillusioned with the public school 
system," said Gillins, whose daughter goes to Meadows. "But this is a lot 
better than three private schools we've had our daughter in." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of local politicians were on hand to present plaques and 
certificates to the school. Also among the speakers was Student President Ebony 
Lewis, 11, a sixth-grader who said she has seen the school improve each year 
she has attended it. 
</P>
<P>
 She called attention to a blue ribbon flag that was hoisted during the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we come to school every morning and look at the flag it will remind us 
that it takes all of us to make this school great," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To give students an extra little reward, Principal Diane von Buelow declared 
that on this day of celebration the students would get a 30-minute recess 
instead of the usual 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like the least we can do," she told the students.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY NAMING OF OVERSEERS FOR PLAN DELAYED; 
REDEVELOPMENT: SCHOOL AND BUSINESS OFFICIALS PERSUADE SANTA CLARITA COUNCIL TO 
POSTPONE ACTION. 
</P>

<P>
 The battle continues over which parts of the public and private sectors will 
oversee this city's 30-year redevelopment plan that could include up to $1.1 
billion in projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita City Council was supposed to establish the hierarchy of 
overseers of the plan Tuesday night, but withheld a decision after school and 
business officials complained of having too little input. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is insufficient (opportunity) for two-way communication," said Connie 
Worden-Roberts, president of a local business park association. She went on to 
complain that business groups that presented their suggestions for the plan to 
the council have never gotten any feedback. 
</P>
<P>
 College of the Canyons Trustee Bruce Fortine tried to dispel rumors that the 
educational community has put its stamp of approval on the plan. He said school 
officials also have felt shut out of the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contrary to rumors, there is no buy-in (from school districts) to the plan," 
Fortine said. "There is no buy-in, because we haven't seen it." 
</P>
<P>
 The council authorized the redevelopment plan in February to help Santa 
Clarita recover from the Northridge earthquake, improve its infrastructure, 
redevelop blighted areas and build affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is planning on future property tax increases to pay for the 
redevelopment projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members have several options regarding controls over the redevelopment 
process. They could retain the authority themselves, grant it to an independent 
board or create a mixed governing body of themselves and other members. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents advisory groups, which have no voting authority, can also be created 
to discuss specific projects. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the options were universally popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents said they want the council to remain in control because its 
members are answerable to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are accountable. You are elected," resident Allan Cameron told the 
council Tuesday. "You must remain in control." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Duckworth, a redevelopment consultant hired by the city, agreed. He 
advised the council that independent boards and mixed rule slow down agency 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Others at the meeting were concerned that making the council the sole overseer 
of the plan gave it too much power. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that . . . is what the community wants," said Chris Townsley, 
head of a residents group that was formed to watchdog the redevelopment plan.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, representatives of Santa Clarita's chambers of commerce 
and school districts offered conditional support for the plan, saying they must 
have "meaningful participation" in its governance. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, representatives of the chambers of commerce and school officials 
complained that questions they previously asked about the plan have been 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we hope this isn't the way the process is going to continue," said school 
Trustee Joan MacGregor.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members agreed to delay their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this needs to be administered fairly and I don't see it in these 
options," Councilwoman Jan Heidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The total value of the projects in Santa Clarita's redevelopment plan has not 
yet been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials originally called for $1.1 billion in projects, but has since 
offered to limit the plan to $854 million as a way to settle a lawsuit filed by 
the Castaic Lake Water Agency. That lawsuit, still pending, calls for the water 
agency to directly receive some of the funds generated by proposed tax 
increases.

 The Movie: "Pulp Fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Writer-director Quentin Tarantino's take on contemporary lowlifes, 
criminals, thieves, drug dealers and their female companions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Betsy Heimann, whose credits include Tarantino's 
"Reservoir Dogs," "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" and "Renaissance Man." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: The weird black suits, white shirts and skinny black ties, and even 
weirder hairdos (worn by John Travolta's greasy-haired Vincent Vega and Samuel 
L. Jackson's Afro-topped Jules, whose curlicue sideburns evoke an old-time 
buccaneer) give the film a graphic and timeless quality. For added punch, we 
get a drug dealer's girl (Rosanna Arquette) with body parts pierced in 18 
places and a sex slave (Steve Hibbert) fully bound in gross-out S&M leather 
gear. 
</P>
<P>
 You Should Know: In the bloodiest scenes that pack the most wallop, the actors 
wear black and white. "I'm always thinking of the tone and color of what people 
are wearing, particularly if they're going to get shot," Heimann explains. 
"(Then) you have to consider if you want to make a big statement or a small 
statement. When the kid gets tortured with gunfire, I didn't need to make it 
more visual because this is just the buildup for what comes next. So he wears a 
dark-green shirt. You have to think of the important moments." 
</P>
<P>
 Triumph: Unforgettably divine is Mia (Uma Thurman), a gangster's top-dog, 
high-style wife, in a black bob wig reminiscent of Danish actress Anna Karina 
and simple elongated white shirt with protracted geometric cuffs, black 
bell-bottoms, black bra and gold ballet slippers. Her lips and nails are blood 
red. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: Assorted characters flaunt earrings in various locations, but few 
actually puncture skin. Travolta's ear was not pierced. Ving Rhames' ears were. 
Arquette's brows, ears, navel, nose, et cetera, were not. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Mia's white shirt and bell-bottoms are from Agnes B., as is Vincent's 
black suit. Jules' black suit is by Perry Ellis. Vincent and Jules' skinny ties 
are vintage. S&M clothing is from Pleasure Chest. BETTY GOODWIN

 Car commercials have been known to show some pretty brutal tests for endurance 
and handling, but none compare to the video you'll see next to a certain Ford 
Explorer at the Long Beach Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
 The video shows clips from the film "Jurassic Park," and the Explorers in the 
film are chomped on, flung around and pretty much demolished by unruly 
Tyrannosauruses. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Jurassic Park" display is just one of the attractions at the auto show at 
Long Beach Convention Center, 300 E. Ocean Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Other highlights include the Team Rollerblade stunt exhibition (Saturday) and, 
of course, new car models, including the Chrysler Cirrus, Toyota Avalon, 
Pontiac Sunfire and a Sunfire Speedster concept car. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also have a chance to dribble and shoot baskets with the Laker Girls -- 
and win Lakers tickets in the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 The show opened Wednesday and runs daily through Sunday, 10 a.m.-10 p.m.; 
Sunday, 10 a.m.-7 p.m. $6 (look for discounts at Thrifty and Chief Auto Parts); 
seniors, $4; children 6-12, $3; under 6, free. (310) 499-7692. LAURIE K.

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: A 'PECULIAR LINK' FOR A WACKY GUY

 Todd Oldham makes clothes for Queen Latifah, Cindy Crawford, Susan Sarandon 
and Julia Roberts. Escada makes clothes for Linda Gray, Deborah Kerr, Joan 
Plowright and a gaggle of ladies who lunch. Never the twain shall meet? Wrong. 
The wacky New York-based designer just signed on as creative consultant to the 
revered German fashion house. He will begin with the fall '95 collections.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm also continuing with my own lines, the fragrance launch in March, the 
shoes, and MTV," said the busy young Texan. "And my own store opened three 
weeks ago (in Soho) and is going fantastically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't told anyone, but I'm also going to open a store in Los Angeles in 
the first six months of next year. Probably in the Beverly/La Brea area, where 
Richard Tyler and Anna Sui have their stores." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the improbable connection with Escada, Oldham said it's not so 
improbable: "I have a deep love of technology, construction and fit. They're 
fond of those too. We both have a bold sense of color and love ornamentation. 
It's a peculiar link, but a cozy one that will work for everyone."

 The Jury Is Still Out: Prosecutor Marcia Clark's perm-damaged do got its 
recent make-over at the Allen Edwards salon in Beverly Hills. Prompted by a 
makeshift fashion adviser, Suzanne Childs of the district attorney's office, 
Clark put herself in Edwards' hands not once but twice.  
</P>
<P>
 First, he gave her a cut. Then he did more clipping and a light re-perm to get 
rid of clenched curls. The result is not exactly sophisticated. "Looking cute 
is better than looking over-sophisticated," Edwards figured. "It's 
professional. It's together. And if you look together, people look up to you."

 Frank-en-Coco: Claire Maglica, who won a recent palimony suit in Orange County 
granting her a generous share in the fortunes of the Mag Lite, would have been 
pleased. A table covered with the slender black flashlights -- stamped Chanel 
-- greeted guests arriving at the launch last week of the French company's fine 
jewelry line. Flashlights in hand, the handsome crowd prowled the loggia of 
Frank Lloyd Wright's rarely seen Ennis-Brown house near the Greek Theatre, 
peering at pieces that dripped from the necks, belly buttons and breasts of 
classical plaster torsos. 
</P>
<P>
 The exquisite display, created by French architect Thierry W. Despont (who won 
the commission to design multibillionaire Bill Gates' Seattle mansion), 
prompted at least five sales and many intense pangs of desire. "That's my 
favorite," said our glamorous friend, a woman who could gracefully wear a 
half-million-dollar necklace and not look overdressed. 
</P>
<P>
 We fell for the rings -- or "sensuous talismans," as the catalogue puts it. 
Was it because they start at a mere $1,250? Or were we merely taken by a bit 
performed the next day by Arie L. Kopelman, president and CEO of Chanel? Over 
breakfast, Kopelman forced the ring onto his pinky and did a perfect 
impersonation of, well, the kind of guy who might wear a big, flashy ring on 
his pinky. Coco Chanel, who abhorred pretension and delighted in mixing the 
precious with the faux, would have loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-plus-piece collection is available at the Chanel Joaillerie Boutique, 
adjacent to the Chanel store in Beverly Hills.

 Northern Exposure: Rangy, rock-star handsome designer Nigel Curtiss arrived at 
Barneys New York in Beverly Hills the other day. But the samples from his 
spring '95 men's line ended up in Anchorage. So we asked Curtiss, who worked as 
commercial director of Comme des Garcons before going out on his own, to 
describe his design direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're for the guy who's over 35 and wants to feel stylish -- but doesn't 
want to look silly," the 37-year-old Curtiss said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm. Sounds like most of the men we know. "If I wouldn't wear it, it's not in 
my line," he said. And in fact, Curtiss looked pretty cool: black mohair wool 
five-button jacket, British-style inverted-pleat tapered trousers and a white 
shirt that, upon closer inspection, turned out to be a patchwork of subtly 
contrasting Jacquard. Peeking out from the subdued look were neon-colored 
striped socks. "They're Comme des Garcons," Curtiss said, grinning. "Years ago, 
I talked Rei (Kawakubo) into putting these into the line."

 A Man on a Mission: On an ordinary outing to Bullock's Westwood last Thursday, 
we noticed a hefty Secret Service type standing guard near the escalator. On 
the other side -- near the Origins display -- stood a stocky but friendly 
looking Los Angeles Police Department officer. "Uh, what's going on?" we asked. 
"Don't ask," we were told. "It's the Prime Minister of Israel," whispered a 
saleswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. It was Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, surrounded by a 
gaggle of attendants. "We have a very important customer," announced a woman 
who seemed to be in charge of this high-powered shopping expedition. She led 
Peres to the earring counter, where he was instantly helped. 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing he didn't need luggage. Not long ago we waited 20 minutes for a 
clerk in that department, then whined to a guy in housewares about it. "Tell it 
to somebody who can do something about it," said Mr. Sympathetic. 
</P>

 Two Guys From Italy: It wasn't fashion as much as the trail of dirt from the 
ongoing tax bribe scandal in the Italian fashion industry that lured us this 
week to the L.A. trunk showings of two of our favorite Milanese men's labels: 
Canali, at Sami Dinar in Beverly Hills, and Vestimenta, at Scott Hill in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole country was surprised by the scandal because every day another top 
designer (Giorgio Armani, Gianni Versace) was involved," said designer Paolo 
Canali. But all of it, he added, stems from two years of political unrest now 
coming to a boil. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Vestimenta's Sandy Symkens, who brought his 50-plus mannequin 
display of Italian menswear shown in January at Carnegie Hall to a vacant 
storefront on Robertson Boulevard, said Italian clothing prices will rise about 
15% next fall. Not because tax-scandal bribes have to be figured into a suit's 
cost, but because of inflated prices on wool and cashmere.

BOOK REVIEW / HISTORY; CELEBRATING A LIFE-AWAKENING, SENSUAL KIND OF 
ARCHITECTURE; FLESH AND STONE: THE BODY AND THE CITY IN WESTERN CIVILIZATION BY 
RICHARD SENNETT ; NORTON $27.50, 431 PAGES

<TEXT>
<P>
 New York University professor Richard Sennett is a Utopian dreamer, although 
it is putting it mildly to say that the urban environment he idealizes in these 
pages differs from the one you and I might imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not an elegantly designed shopping plaza where people eat, drink and buy 
merrily, but rather "Beer Street" (1751), William Hogarth's engraved evocation 
of a ramshackle square taken over by a small crowd of people downing malt, 
caressing lovers and fomenting debate. It is not a smooth and swift joy ride 
down the superhighway in a shiny Lexus, but rather an arduous trek in a 
horse-drawn coach over a bumpy dirt road. It is not a society in which urban 
sophisticates dress to kill, but rather Thucydides' Athens, where the 
"barbarians" wear furs and the "civilized" saunter naked. Finally, it is not a 
life lived lightheartedly, but rather a "stressed . . . experience of our 
bodies" -- for that, after all, will make us "more aware of the world in which 
we live." 
</P>
<P>
 If you think Sennett is going out of his way to be contrary, you are not 
alone. In a magazine profile published earlier this month, humanities scholar 
Harold Bloom was pictured in various states of distress -- hands clenching head 
as if to prevent it from exploding, eyebrows raised in horror akin to Edvard 
Munch's "The Scream" -- because he thinks that "watery disciples" of scholars 
such as Michel Foucault (Sennett was a close friend of the late French 
philosopher) are abandoning the study of classical history and literature to 
pursue idiosyncratic and often politically motivated inquiries into social 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom is correct, of course, to think that many '60s-trained scholars have 
become so skeptical of inherited tradition that rather than standing on the 
shoulders of giants they have been sinking in the mud of self-absorption. And 
to be sure, Sennett's study here of the way modern architecture and urban 
planning have failed to accommodate people's physical and sensory needs 
regurgitates some of the same ideas explored in his 1990 book, "The Conscience 
of the Eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "Flesh and Stone" offers unmistakable proof that Bloom is wrong to 
assume that scholarship necessarily suffers when it tries to address social 
problems. Sennett admits at the outset that he is writing this book largely out 
of his own disillusionment with "the dullness, the monotony, and the tactile 
sterility" that afflict today's urban environment. But in his search for 
alternative environments, he is not too proud to stand on others' shoulders (in 
particular, Freud's and Foucault's) and he is careful to examine history 
without idealizing it. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sennett celebrates the lively human communion inspired by the 
architecture of ancient Athens, for instance, he does not present ancient 
Greece per se as a model, for he points out that the minority's 
self-realization came at the expense of the majority's oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 Sennett's interesting conclusion is that it may well be impossible to create 
urban spaces that satisfy the panoply of our desires, because our desires are 
contradictory: As Freud showed, we crave both the safe and unknowing pleasure 
of the womb and the stimulating pleasures of society.  
</P>
<P>
 Sennett explains that a similar tension has existed in urban architecture. 
Engineers in ancient Greece created the great city square (or agora ) to "make 
people more aware of each other, more physically responsive." Modern urban 
designers such as New York's Robert Moses, in contrast, have been more eager to 
design soothing, isolating, narcotizing spaces like superhighways.  
</P>
<P>
 With the proliferation of "edge cities," suburbs where the closest thing to a 
town square is the public access station on cable TV, Sennett sees little hope 
for a revival of dynamic public space. But this reader can't help but consider 
the argument of today's computer enthusiasts that a new, closely knit human 
community is now forming -- not in classical, physical reality but in virtual 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, who knows? Perhaps the next profound, dynamic, lively social 
revolution will begin not in the Bastille, but on the Internet.

O.C. POP BEAT: PUNK-VINTAGE DESIGN DRIVES BIG DRILL CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting with its apt name, and continuing with its stripped-down sound and 
forthright outlook, Big Drill Car is a band that likes to keep things simple 
and direct. 
</P>
<P>
 While there may be no actual blueprint and operator's manual for a conveyance 
called a big drill car, listening to the band gives you a good idea of how such 
a machine might function. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Arnold's guitar playing suggests both the scraping edges of a heavy-duty 
cutting tool and the chunky, massive slabs of rock the tool would hew out and 
plow aside. The quartet's hard, propulsive beat suggests plenty of horsepower 
and speedy acceleration. From singer Frank Daly come melodies that are compact 
and crisply efficient -- nothing too elaborate, but catchy enough to keep 
pop-sweetened additives gurgling through the carburetor. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever a Big Drill Car is (the name comes from a science fiction B-movie), 
the rock 'n' roll version has a rapidly revving engine of punk-vintage design, 
and will be winding up its latest tour with a series of Southern California 
concerts: Saturday at the Showcase Theatre in Corona, Sunday at the Troubadour 
in West Hollywood and Monday at the Ice House in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparable product lines in the showroom of punk-pop include Husker Du, which 
rolled out of Minneapolis in the 1980s, and the band All, which has its roots 
in two early L.A. punk bands, Black Flag and the Descendents. All has served as 
a kind of big-brother band to BDC, with All members Bill Stevenson and/or 
Stephen Egerton contributing production work to Big Drill Car's 3 studio albums 
and its debut EP. 
</P>
<P>
 As it approaches its seventh anniversary (the band's first gig was on 
Halloween, 1987), Big Drill Car seems to be living up to the title of its 
current (and best) album, "No Worse For the Wear." But even a reliable model is 
going to require pit stops and repairs over the long run. During a difficult 
transitional period that began early in 1992, Big Drill Car frequently found 
itself stuck in the garage, scrounging for spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "For two years, we couldn't take five steps forward without sliding back 
three. It was a drag," said Daly, summing up a period that brought three 
personnel switches in the rhythm section and a change of record labels. 
</P>
<P>
 The now-retooled band gathered for an interview last week in a Costa Mesa 
warehouse block that is a warren of rock 'n' roll activity, housing recording 
studios, an independent record label/concert promotion company called Stab You 
in the Back, and the barely-big-enough cubicle that the four members of Big 
Drill Car jam into for their rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, sharp-featured and lean with intense blue eyes, did most of the talking, 
setting off his earnest answers with wry turns of phrase. His foil and the 
band's co-founder is the mellow Arnold, a friendly bear of a man with a big, 
slope-shouldered frame, a mild, husky voice and a broad, open face framed by 
long, blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The two newer recruits bring a quietly impish streak to the band personality. 
Darrin Morris, who took over for original bassist Bob Thomson in 1992, is the 
youngest member at 24 (Arnold, 32, is the oldest) and has the sly grin of a 
mischievous choirboy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Reidling, who joined just three months ago, is, at 26, a veteran drummer 
who has played in many local bands including the Cadillac Tramps. He replaced 
Keith Fallis, who stayed a year before getting married and leaving for New 
Mexico. Reidling didn't need much inducement or coaching: He has been friendly 
with Daly since their school days in Costa Mesa and was enough of a Big Drill 
Car fan to know most of the songs before he joined. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of Danny Marcroft, the original drummer, was the hardest change 
to deal with, according to Daly, who is 26. "When Bob quit (to join the Orange 
County band Xtra Large) there was no doubt we'd keep going. But when Danny 
quit, the entire future of the band was up in the air. He was an integral part 
(but) he said the idea of getting in a van and going on tour again gave him a 
stomach ache." 
</P>
<P>
 It helped, Daly said, that he, Arnold and Morris had confidence in the songs 
they were working on at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 What eventually emerged was an album that stuck with themes and musical 
approaches familiar from the band's previous releases, "Small Block," "Album 
Type Thing," "Batch" and the live "Toured." But the usual Big Drill Car formula 
came across with renewed power and exuberance and, in the best songs, an extra 
measure of melodic appeal and thematic bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly -- whose fourth wedding anniversary is Saturday (he met his wife, Penny, 
while on tour with Big Drill Car in Canada) -- sings winningly and 
affirmatively about sustaining love amid difficulties and separations ("Friend 
of Mine," "Step Right Up"). He said the troubled relationship depicted in the 
album-closing "Hye" was inspired by the departures that temporarily stalled Big 
Drill Car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always written about the plainest things, the things closest to me," he 
said. "My relationships have always been the closest. It's gone from 'get out 
of my hair' to 'it's pretty good to be hanging with you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of its colleagues who came up on the Orange County punk scene, BDC 
has a continuing theme in songs warning about the dangers of hard drugs. "Yer 
Holdin' " is the latest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all pretty much experimented with whatever's out there," said Daly. 
"Watching my friends crash and burn is what's kept me from crashing and 
burning. It's just a waste. You don't know them anymore. They're just a 
different person." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he isn't sure whether the substance-abusing friends he wrote about in 
"Yer Holdin' " have recognized themselves in the song. "They're still my 
friends. I see them, but it's like (being with) a ghost." 
</P>
<P>
 The straightforward quality that comes through in Big Drill Car's music 
carries over in the members' unusual and refreshing willingness to acknowledge 
their creative failures and limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold said he was able to bolster the band's live sound on its last national 
tour (which included nine shows opening for the Offspring, a pairing suggested 
by the bands' mutual booking agent) by playing his guitar through two 
amplifiers instead of one, adding a stereo effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it a matter of an improved tour budget finally allowing a more elaborate 
rig? 
</P>
<P>
 No, Arnold said. "It was more (a case of) me not being such a stooge and 
(finally) figuring it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said that "No Worse For the Wear" is "by far my favorite" among the Big 
Drill Car records. Yet he confessed that he disappointed himself by not seizing 
the opportunity to take more creative risks with the album. Some atypical 
tempos and studio effects that the band had come up with in rehearsals were 
jettisoned for the final recording. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried some of those things (in the studio) and for some reason, it didn't 
blow us over anymore. Or," he added after a slight pause, "I got scared and 
said, 'We never did that before; we can't do that.' We just went the safe 
route. I've never been too hip on taking chances." 
</P>
<P>
 His even tone suggested he knows how to be critical of himself without beating 
himself up. More recently, in a series of vinyl singles, Big Drill Car has been 
experimenting with different approaches. One notable result is "Song No. 40," 
released recently on "By the Banks of the Mighty Santa Ana, Vol. II," a vinyl 
EP compilation of Orange County bands. 
</P>
<P>
 With its ballad tempo and elegiac tone, and its use of a warm, wailing Hammond 
organ and a throbbing, countrified guitar, the song (approximately the 40th 
Arnold and Daly have recorded together) takes a big step away from the BDC 
norm. It sounds like a cross between Mott the Hoople's "All the Young Dudes" 
and Neil Young's "Roll Another Number (For the Road)," and is one of the band's 
most memorable and emotional recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Drill Car's three upcoming shows in Southern California mark the end of an 
extensive touring campaign in which a Dodge van acquired 13 months ago has 
logged 45,000 miles. The results have been mixed, Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing to between 200 and 500 fans a night, "we're drawing as well as we ever 
did, if not better." But he is disappointed with sales of "No Worse For the 
Wear," BDC's first studio release (after a stop-gap live album during the 
band's unsettled period) on the San Diego label Headhunter/Cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said sales of the band's first three releases, on Cruz Records, are 
"pushing 20,000" each, a respectable total for a small independent label. "The 
new one hasn't sold that many, to be perfectly honest with you. I don't know if 
it's a distribution problem or a lack of popularity problem or a lack of 
advertising. I'm kind of miffed." 
</P>
<P>
 However, a video for "Friend of Mine" has just been released, and with luck 
(well, a lot of luck) the album might get a commercial boost. At this point, 
Big Drill Car's members don't earn a living from the band, although their tours 
make money and provide a stipend to go with earnings from an assortment of day 
jobs that ranges from Arnold's work as a recording engineer and concert 
soundman to Morris's job delivering Chinese takeout. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, they are experienced practitioners of a brand of music that 
in the past year or two has shown vast commercial potential. Everybody knows 
what's happened to the Offspring and Green Day. Now, Big Drill Car's mentors in 
All have signed their first major label deal, with Interscope Records. 
Interscope's roster also includes Rocket From the Crypt and Drive Like Jehu, 
who share the same management as Big Drill Car. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said Big Drill Car will respond to the new climate by continuing business 
as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we're purposely trying" to write songs that will land a big 
contract, he said. "If you do that, it becomes contrived. You're not yourself; 
you're being what someone else wants you to be. We'll do what we've always 
done. If the pendulum swings our way, or smacks us in the head, we're open to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-year gap between studio releases, BDC's immediate plans call for 
writing new songs and being ready by spring to begin a new round of recording 
and touring. Things seem stable after that turbulent patch -- unless, of 
course, somebody in the band starts feeling the seven-year itch and brings more 
unsettling to the BDC marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a concept not foreign to Daly, who kicked off Big Drill Car's recording 
career by singing a song about a collapsed relationship called "5 Year Itch," 
the first song on the first Big Drill Car release. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, speaking in his firmest tone, he is having none of it: "I think the only 
seven-year itch is a Marilyn Monroe movie." 
</P>
<P>
 * Big Drill Car, the Goops, Bottom 12 and Lidsville play Monday at the Ice 
House, 112 E. Walnut Ave., Fullerton. 8 p.m. $8. Taped information: (714)

SHLOMO MINTZ COUNTS HIS BLESSINGS TOO; MUSIC: THE VIOLINIST AND VIOLIST, WHO 
WILL LEAD THE ISRAEL CHAMBER ORCHESTRA IN CERRITOS TONIGHT, IS A MASTER OF MANY 
TRADES, ALSO SERVING AS ARTISTIC DIRECTOR AND CONDUCTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly everybody in classical music has heard that old saw about Vivaldi 
writing a great concerto -- 600 times. Shlomo Mintz, who will lead the Israel 
Chamber Orchestra in Cerritos tonight, attributes the remark to composer Luigi 
Dallapiccola. But Mintz isn't laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I would not want to get personal on this at all, I would urge Mr. 
Dallapiccola to take a closer look at those works, and then tell me if it's 
been written 600 times," said Mintz, reached by phone at a tour stop in 
Montreux, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure I can convince him otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Dallapiccola died in 1975. Still, Mintz has become somewhat of 
an expert on the subject of Vivaldi. He and the Chamber Orchestra are surveying 
the complete Vivaldi concertos for violin and orchestra for Music Masters 
Classics; six compact discs, including the first-ever recording of the "Anna 
Maria" concertos, have already been released. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Mintz will take a breather from that repertory. He and the orchestra 
will tackle Hindemith's Trauermusik for viola and orchestra, with Mintz as 
viola soloist; Schubert's Rondo in A for violin and orchestra, D. 438, with 
Mintz as violin soloist; Stravinsky's Concerto for Strings in D, and Mozart's 
Symphony No. 41 in C, "Jupiter." 
</P>
<P>
 Though better known as a violinist, Mintz regularly performs on viola with 
string quartets and other chamber ensembles. He declined to say whether he 
favors either instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same mind and spirit should be behind (playing) the two," he said. "There 
should be no technical difficulties in playing either. I try to be totally 
involved in interpretation and not ever think that 'now I play the violin' or 
'now I play viola.' I enjoy doing everything equally." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, when he became artistic adviser to the 36-member Israel 
Chamber Orchestra, "doing everything" also came to include conducting. Last 
year, his capacity at ICO changed to that of guest conductor, and in March he 
was named artistic adviser and principal guest conductor of the Symphony 
Orchestra of Maastricht in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all the joy of making music," he said of his several careers, "of 
discovering those hidden beauties." 
</P>
<P>
 So what's next, drums? 
</P>
<P>
 "If I put my mind to it, that too is what I'd do," he replied. "Right now it's 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 He was born in Moscow but emigrated with his family to Israel two years later. 
He made his concerto debut at age 11 with the Israel Philharmonic, and not long 
after that Zubin Mehta called on him to replace an indisposed Itzhak Perlman. 
Mintz made his Carnegie Hall debut with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra at 
age 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Marking the 20th anniversary of that debut, he appeared last season as violin 
soloist with the St. Petersburg Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall and at the 
Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and with the Orchestre National de France 
at Avery Fisher Hall in New York. He toured abroad with the Czech Philharmonic 
and Israel Chamber Orchestra and gave recitals in Europe and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on two decades in the business of making music, he counted his 
blessings. "I take a very realistic view of how difficult things could be, and 
how difficult things were for other great men in the past. If one takes that 
overall view, one does not complain." 
</P>
<P>
 * Shlomo Mintz and the Israel Chamber Orchestra play works by Hindemith, 
Schubert, Stravinsky and Mozart tonight at the Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts, 12700 Center Court Drive, Cerritos. 8 p.m. $30 to $50. (310)

WHAT O.C. COMPILATION NEEDS IS . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A while back in O.C. Pop Beat, I proposed that Orange County's punk rock 
community organize to put out a compilation album chronicling the early history 
of the local punk scene. I gave my own track-by-track recommendations and asked 
readers to send in any suggestions to the contrary. Here they are: 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey Carmichael of Corona del Mar would bag the Adolescents' "Amoeba" 
(overplayed on KROQ) and "Kids of the Black Hole" (too long) and would 
substitute "Wrecking Crew" and "Rip It Up" from the same band ("true, super 
pissed-off punk rock that pertain(s) to what it was like to be part of the 
scene back then. I was there."). 
</P>
<P>
 Carmichael further suggests adding "Reagan der Fuehrer" by D.I. and, from 
Social Distortion, "Another State of Mind" and "Lewd Boy," which "just said 
everything to me. Not now, but then."  
</P>
<P>
 From the original T.S.O.L., he suggests "Sounds of Laughter" in lieu of "I'm 
Tired," which "sounds too much like that new Offspring song." From the "Change 
Today?" album by the revamped T.S.O.L., he prefers "Flowers by the Door" and 
"It's Gray." Carmichael also says nix to "Urban Struggle" by the Vandals 
"because of the KROQ factor. It's not that they're a bad station; I just can't 
stand to hear one of these great songs followed up by Erasure or the Cure." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another correspondent, who asked that her name not be published, feels I was 
remiss in ignoring Agent Orange's punked-up version of the surf classic 
"Pipeline." She argues that Agent Orange's take on the Chantays' original is 
"the single greatest recording ever to come out of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 She suggests including Agent Orange's "Breakdown" and the instrumental version 
of "Bite the Hand That Feeds," as well as "Moral Threat" by Social Distortion, 
a song she describes as "the quintessence of O.C. punk: big, loud, stupid, 
(with) an emphasis on persecution coupled with a kind of punk triumphalism, and 
no trace of a sense of humor." MIKE BOEHM

UNLV, MASSIMINO GET NASTY; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: ANOTHER LEGAL BATTLE BREWING AS 
COACH AND UNIVERSITY REMAIN FAR APART ON BUYOUT TERMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 No stranger to long-running legal battles, Nevada Las Vegas might soon have 
another nasty courtroom fight on its hands after the refusal Wednesday of 
embattled basketball Coach Rollie Massimino to accept the school's cash offer 
to terminate his lucrative and controversial contract. 
</P>
<P>
 A scheduled meeting between Massimino, UNLV interim President Kenny Guinn and 
Athletic Director Jim Weaver in Weaver's office ended abruptly with the two 
sides far apart on a possible buyout figure, Guinn said. No further meetings 
are scheduled, and Guinn said he is now forced to talk with UNLV's legal 
counsel about options available to the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "The meeting only lasted 30 seconds or so, and we do not have any type of an 
agreement," Guinn said. "It just really comes down to one simple fact, and 
that's that his floor didn't come down to where our ceiling is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be meeting with the university legal advisers today and we'll decide 
what's in the best interest of the university and the overall program." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley Berkley, a member of the University of Nevada board of regents, said 
an unplanned meeting could be called as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "One way or another, Rollie Massimino will not coach the UNLV team," Berkley 
said. "He can hold out and try to (get) all the money he wants, but he will not 
be the coach of this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino, scheduled to begin his third season as the Rebels' coach when 
practice begins Saturday, was curt with reporters when leaving the basketball 
offices at the Thomas & Mack Center. When asked if he was done as coach of the 
team, Massimino said: "No, not that I know of." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Guinn would not comment on the specifics of UNLV's proposed buyout 
package, sources said the school offered $330,000 per year over five years. 
Guinn said the buyout proposal is based solely on Massimino's $511,000 annual 
salary agreed to by university regents -- not the $375,000 more a year promised 
to Massimino in a secret deal brokered with former UNLV president Robert 
Maxson, who now has the same position at Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 Revelation of the secret deal by the Las Vegas Sun in August made Massimino's 
already tenuous position even weaker. The Rebels have not sustained the top 
level of play they did under former coach Jerry Tarkanian, whom Massimino 
replaced in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The supplemental contract, which was not approved by the board of regents, was 
to be paid by a private group in the Las Vegas community dubbed "The Varsity 
Club." 
</P>
<P>
 Reports have said Massimino, 59, has been paid $300,000 over the last two 
years, is owed $450,000 currently and another $475,000 next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinn refuses to acknowledge the additional contract, and has told Massimino 
he will not receive the money from the university. 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino, who led Villanova to the 1985 NCAA championship, is 36-21 at UNLV, 
including 15-13 last season. The Rebels have failed to qualify for the NCAA 
tournament in his two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting with Massimino on Monday, Guinn was optimistic the situation 
would be resolved by Wednesday. He described the previous meeting as amicable. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the other day, I certainly felt we were within striking distance," Guinn 
said. "But you just can't keep changing every time you go in (to a settlement 
meeting). We just reaffirmed our position." 
</P>
<P>
 So with both sides seemingly steadfast in their positions, Guinn acknowledges 
that the protracted legal battle he hoped to circumvent might be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 But although he knows the university and community are weary from the many 
legal fights over the basketball team that arose out of the Tarkanian regime, 
he is determined not to leave the situation as is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to avoid a (legal fight) at any cost, because if I was I would 
have just raised our ceiling," Guinn said. "But I think the easiest thing for 
anybody to do is run to litigation, and we've seen that here."

NO SOLUTION TO OAK TREE FAUX PAS; HORSE RACING: INVESTIGATION BLAMES ACCIDENTAL 
SCRATCHING AND REINSTATEMENT OF FAVORITE AT SANTA ANITA ON "HUMAN ERROR." NO 
ACTION WILL BE TAKEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Horse Racing Board, completing an investigation into the 
incorrect scratching of a horse last week at Santa Anita, said Wednesday that 
the mistake was a "human error" and that "nothing can be done to rectify an 
unfortunate situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Caesour, the 3-1 morning-line favorite in the $47,000 fifth race on Oct. 5, 
was bet down to 2-1 when he was pulled off the tote board eight minutes before 
the race. George Haines II, director of the parimutuel department at Santa 
Anita, said that an Autotote employee meant to scratch the No. 9 horse from the 
eighth race but instead scratched Caesour, who was also No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 There was widespread confusion among bettors, many of whom quickly went to the 
windows and obtained refunds for their bets on Caesour. Other bettors who 
wanted to bet Caesour avoided the horse because they thought he had been 
scratched. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Haines, 2 1/2 minutes after the error and 5 1/2 minutes before 
the start of the race, the tote-board odds on Caesour were put back up, 
indicating the horse was still running. Caesour went off at 9-2, won the race 
by a length and paid $11. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Goodrich, president of Santa Anita, said that he wouldn't know until 
today how much money was refunded on Caesour during the 2 1/2 minutes the horse 
appeared to be scratched. Mike Manning, assistant general manager at the track, 
said that Santa Anita had received "a dozen or so" complaints from bettors.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita officials said they don't know if any disgruntled bettors will 
take legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're upset, and they have a right to be," Goodrich said. "But we're 
dealing with humans, and humans aren't perfect. Now, I don't know what we could 
do, because we'd be dealing with a documentation factor. The bettors who got 
refunds during the time they thought the horse was scratched probably wouldn't 
have any proof that they tried to bet the horse. We couldn't be sure who those 
people were, and we wouldn't be able to separate them from people who would 
come up just saying they bet the horse." 
</P>
<P>
 A bettor from an off-track satellite facility in North Dakota called the Santa 
Anita stewards with a complaint that seemed to be valid. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought he had made an exacta bet using the entire field on top with the 
horse that finished second," steward Tom Ward said. "But because he made the 
bet while the winner was theoretically scratched, he didn't have the No. 9 in 
his 'all' ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward didn't know the amount of that bet. Caesour and Luthier Fever, the 
second-place finisher who went off the 2-1 favorite, combined for a $2 exacta 
payoff of $37.60. With the 12-1 Bird Brown finishing third, the $2 trifecta for 
getting the first three finishers right was worth $393.60. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Weisman of Glendora and her daughter, Patricia, were among the fans who 
were puzzled by the apparent scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter actually went to the windows three times," Weisman said. "She 
made a bet on what would have been the winning exacta combination, but then 
went back to cancel that bet and change to another combination when she saw the 
horse was scratched. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, when she saw the scratched horse was back in, she went back a third 
time to bet her original combination, but was shut out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the Baldwin Club (Santa Anita's new version of the turf club), and 
people were really livid. A lot of them were screaming. They felt they had been 
taken. I've been going to the races for 20 years and I've never seen a 
scratched horse be unscratched and allowed to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was disgusting. And if Santa Anita and the state aren't doing anything 
about it, it's asinine." 
</P>
<P>
 The Autotote technician who made the error on Caesour was a management 
replacement for a striking worker. Autotote, the company that supplies the tote 
system at Santa Anita, has been involved in a national labor dispute with its 
technicians since Aug. 19. Goodrich said that about 12 management-supplied 
technicians from Autotote are working at the Oak Tree meet. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing that the state's investigation was over, Roy Wood, executive 
director of the racing board, said that the technician "was counseled so that a 
similar mistake won't happen again." The technician was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ward and Goodrich said that the stewards and the track might have handled 
the situation differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave no thought to scratching the horse, because that would have been 
unfair to the owner and trainer," Ward said. "In retrospect, we could have 
announced to the crowd what had happened, and then delayed the start of the 
race to give them extra time to get their bets down. But that's hindsight." 
</P>
<P>
 Had the stewards declared Caesour a non-betting starter, they probably would 
have faced even more anger after the horse won. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood did not criticize the stewards. "They acted quickly," he said. "They took 
corrective action in ample time for the bettors to make their bets."

JIM MURRAY: PRIZING UNCLE ED'S ACUMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm going to recommend my Uncle Ed for the Nobel Prize -- posthumously. 
</P>
<P>
 You all remember my Uncle Ed? Edward Michael Murray. My gambling uncle. Fast 
Eddie. The dead ringer for Jimmy Cagney. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed is a strange candidate for a Nobelist, I grant you. Never finished grammar 
school. Too busy playing hooky, shooting craps. The nuns told him to take his 
dice and stop taking up seats that could be better used by people studying who 
won Napoleonic wars, not the probabilities of how to make a hard eight. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps you noticed the other day where the Nobel committee bestowed their 
prestigious prize on three economists who have evolved something called the 
"game theory." 
</P>
<P>
 As I get it, this is nothing more than applying poker principles, or dice 
principles, to everyday business. It is a program of knowing your opposition in 
sports or in business in advance so as to have maximum advantage in dealing 
with them. "It will give us a higher standard of living because we make better 
decisions." The "game theory" approach is derived from studies of games like 
poker, chess or dice, we are told. It involves gamesmanship to the extent of 
increasing your chance of success by evaluating your opponent and predicting 
his countermoves. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, excuse me! Uncle Ed did that 60 years ago. Sometimes, of course, he 
"predicted" the response of adversaries by boiling the dice. At other times, he 
anticipated countermoves by stuffing extra dice up his sleeve that he would 
substitute on the felt as soon as he heard, "You're faded." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nobelists' theory calls for studying how competitors will react to deals 
according to ethnic background, psychological predisposition or past 
predictable behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 You think Ed didn't do that? He didn't write any books about it. But he put it 
in practice. What's so profound about that? You think Ed didn't know his pal 
Rome would always stand on 16 in blackjack or that if he got Brennan into the 
Jack Daniels at the crap table he could substitute the crooked dice at will? 
</P>
<P>
 And tell me, do you know any more effective game theorists than the Vegas 
oddsmakers? Anybody ever make a more thorough study of the breeding, family 
tree, daily habits and nervous system of entities they were about to go in 
business with than horse players? 
</P>
<P>
 How about football coaches? You think anybody ever studied the competition any 
more thoroughly than they do? Not Macy's or Gimbel's, Ford or General Motors. 
The clandestine scouting report, together with practice field spying, was put 
into practice by a football coach, I believe General Bob Neyland of Tennessee. 
He pioneered the practice of predicting opposition tactics by cataloguing their 
"tendencies." What does Alabama always do on third and long in its own 
territory? Which team won't punt on fourth and one if it's behind with less 
than three minutes to play? Neyland had the answers under lock and key 
someplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Never got a Nobel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nobelists -- John C. Harsanyi, John F. Nash and Reinhard Selten -- 
acknowledge part of their program is intuitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Well?! Big surprise. So was Ed's. I dare say he spent as much time in 
laboratory research as the good professors. The economists say their key is the 
position that if you can understand the strategies of your rivals you gain 
insight into the outcome of your business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed could have told them that! Sometimes he got an insight into their 
strategies by dealing them, say, a pair of jacks, from the bottom of the deck. 
He also gained insight into the outcome that way. By dealing himself queens. 
</P>
<P>
 I had no idea the Nobel was looking for scientists who involved themselves 
with the arts and mysteries of bluffing at poker, second-guessing the 
quarterback, counting the cards or raising the pot. I always thought the Nobel 
went to guys who had stopped killing people for the moment like, say, Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 But every time Tommy Lasorda walks the cleanup hitter to get to the next guy, 
he's a game theorist. When Oliver McCall notices Lennox Lewis is carrying his 
right hand low, he's a game theorist. 
</P>
<P>
 They used to call guys who practiced what these guys advocate "hustlers." In 
boardrooms, they call them "major players." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed did everything these guys recommend. But his economics were applied, not 
theoretical. The Royal Swedish Academy paid no attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But were his discoveries applicable to running IBM? Well, you judge. One of 
his phrases to live by to me was, "If the other guy has two aces showing, 
fold." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street couldn't say it any better.

STOKES IS NOT ALONE; ALTHOUGH SIDELINED BY INJURY, BRUIN STAR STILL ATTRACTS 
INTEREST FROM NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J.J. Stokes has been poked and prodded, baked and boiled, mauled and massaged, 
shocked, stroked and stimulated. 
</P>
<P>
 He has spent more time on a bicycle than Greg LeMond. More time in the water 
than Janet Evans. More time on various electrical hookups than a TV repairman. 
</P>
<P>
 What he has not spent is much time in the UCLA lineup. His absence is part of 
the reason for a 2-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes was a certain first-round NFL pick when he lined up at wide receiver 
against Tennessee in the season opener. He is still a potential first-round 
pick, even though he took a Tennessee helmet on his left leg that has had him 
hobbling for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The injury, as it appears, isn't debilitating," said Jon Kingdon, Raider 
player personnel director. "He's not as productive this year as he would want, 
so you have to rely on last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's efforts (82 catches for 1,181 yards and 17 touchdowns) made him an 
All-American and gave him enough Heisman Trophy votes for UCLA to mount a 
campaign for him to win the award as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they have to do is pull out (videotape of) his junior year and they're 
going to find all kinds of good stuff," said John Becker, the Rams' personnel 
director. "Everybody knows who this guy is and that he's got lots of ability. I 
would say that where (his draft status) could get altered is if the injury is 
an ongoing type of thing or something that has affected his speed or 
durability." 
</P>
<P>
 The injury is a deep thigh bruise, and with swelling and gravity, fluid has 
drained into the knee, restricting his mobility. 
</P>
<P>
 On UCLA's fourth offensive play of the season, he ran a short pattern, 
designed to let quarterback Wayne Cook get him the ball quickly and for Stokes 
to do what he does best: shed tacklers and gain yards. 
</P>
<P>
 A tackler hit him, and Stokes stepped up. Another hit him, and he stepped 
back. Deron Jenkins came in and Stokes slapped him on the shoulder pad to try 
to ward off the tackle. Jenkins' helmet hit Stokes on the inside of his left 
thigh, just off the pad in his pants. 
</P>
<P>
 The play gained nine yards. It lost UCLA its top offensive threat. 
</P>
<P>
 He played the rest of the half, catching six passes for 84 yards, and the leg 
stiffened, putting him on the sideline for the rest of the game. He has played 
in one game since, lining up for 23 snaps and catching one pass for 13 yards 
against Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Six games, seven catches for 97 yards, no touchdowns. Through six games last 
season, he had 36 catches for 603 yards and 12 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 He had nine catches for 86 yards and a touchdown in his seventh game, against 
Oregon State. Against the Beavers on Saturday night, he probably will watch, 
still healing, still trying to salvage his season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He won't play until he's 100%," Coach Terry Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes tried. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would play against Southern Methodist in the second game of the 
season, because he had always played. Stokes had never sat out a game at any 
level of football because of injury, but SMU was his first. A week later, 
Nebraska was his second. 
</P>
<P>
 He lined up at about 80% effectiveness against Washington State and found out 
what 80% of J.J. Stokes meant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little things shocked me," he said. "I went deep on a pattern and the 
defensive back was running with me stride-for-stride. If I had a good leg, I 
would be a couple of steps ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt weird because I looked over at Kevin (Jordan), and he was four or five 
yards ahead of me and was ahead of the DB. I said, 'Wow,' and it's only 20 or 
30 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 The leg stiffened at halftime and swelled on Sunday. Stokes has not played 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has not won since. 
</P>
<P>
 In Stokes' absence, Jordan is leading the Pacific 10 and is third in the 
nation in receiving, with 40 catches for 611 yards and three touchdowns. Still, 
Jordan said, "When J.J. is out there, he's the best receiver on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a 100% Stokes. An 80% Stokes is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized I didn't have the same effect on the outcome of the game," he 
said. "I would have a smaller effect. When I'm out there and healthy, I can 
make one or two plays to spark an offense. I can get the ball and break a 
couple of tackles and the defense has to respect that, so maybe we can run the 
ball a little better. But I can't win a game by myself." 
</P>
<P>
 He watches, attends meetings and goes through therapy twice a day. Electrical 
stimulation. Ice. Cold water. He leaves the trainer's room and walks on the 
practice field half an hour or more after teammates. Then it's on to the 
bicycle. He watches the receivers. His presence is more social than anything 
else, and he affects an attitude that there's nothing he can do about it, so 
there's no sense worrying about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't help being injured," he said. "It's my job now to help the team by 
making my best effort to be 100% healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 But quietly, it's said, he is struggling with not playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm practicing, I often think about other things I could be doing, 
watching TV, whatever," he said. "But being on the outside, looking in, I miss 
practice. It looks exciting to me, and that's just practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the Rose Bowl last year, I didn't want to play football for about a 
week. But then I was ready to strap it on and play." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he was held out of contact in spring practice and during preseason 
drills because coaches were concerned he would be injured. When Stokes decided 
to return to UCLA, he was forgoing hundreds of thousands of dollars from the 
NFL. When he drove his hand-me-down Mustang from his San Diego home to 
Westwood, it was with the knowledge that it could have been a Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
 He was bulletproof. An offer of disability insurance last season was spurned 
because he said he didn't need it. He procrastinated when it was offered again 
this year. Friends told him to get it. So did his father. So did Donahue. 
Stokes waffled. The premium is high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Why do it since I'm not worried about getting injured?' " he 
said. "I'm not in football for the money. I love the sport, but if I get 
injured, I'll just walk away and do something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, he signed the papers. For $40,000, payable when he signs an 
NFL contract, he would be compensated on a sliding scale if he is drafted below 
the third round because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mostly for my family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had an MRI test last Thursday because UCLA medical officials were wondering 
if they had missed something. The test was negative. It's still only a bruise. 
</P>
<P>
 The test becomes part of the Stokes medical file, and it will be scrutinized 
by the NFL scouts who parade in daily to look at the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football is a game where you expect injury," said Charlie Mackey, who scouts 
the West Coast for the Chicago Bears. "Only if he had a history of injury would 
it affect the way we look at him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mackey was a scout for the Dallas Cowboys when UCLA had a similar situation 
with Mike Sherrard, who broke his collarbone midway through his senior season. 
The Cowboys still drafted him in the first round, 18th overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to get healthy, tried to stay involved, but it was tough," said 
Sherrard, now with the New York Giants. "But my broken collarbone wasn't the 
kind of injury pro scouts were going to worry about. And neither is J.J.'s. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may think about it, but it isn't really something he should worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrard was at the Rose Bowl for the UCLA-Washington State game. "I 
definitely knew J.J. wasn't right," he said. "I could tell then that he didn't 
look 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrard worked out with Stokes this summer. There is nobody like Stokes in 
the NFL, he said. "J.J.'s going to be fine. He should enjoy the college year, 
whether he's playing or not. Pro football is going to be different from college 
for him." 
</P>
<P>
 There is still time for Stokes to have a senior season. If he is able to play 
to his old form in the Bruins' final four games, NFL scouts say, the first 
seven won't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if UCLA isn't in a bowl, Stokes will have an opportunity to show he has 
recovered in postseason all-star games. There is also the scouting combine in 
Indianapolis next winter, when the orthopedic specialists of 30 teams will be 
there to inspect his leg and where clocks will determine whether his speed has 
diminished. He's still a 6-foot-5, 218-pound wide receiver with extraordinary 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when this guy sets his workout days (at UCLA), you think there won't be a 
crowd there?" the Rams' Becker said. "There are lot of guys who didn't play all 
that well in their senior years, first-round guys. Why did they get drafted? 
Because they can run real fast or jump real high -- because of their potential, 
basically. He'll be tired of being looked at. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether he has played his senior year or not, guys like him aren't just 
walking the streets. The injury hasn't helped him, but he has too many 
qualities that you just don't find for it to hurt him. I would be extremely 
surprised if his draft status has dropped very much." 
</P>
<P>
 Agents agree. They continue to call, soliciting the right to negotiate his NFL 
contract. Stokes puts them on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to enjoy my last four to five games," he said. "I think I can 
just let my actions speak. If I can just catch the ball and do what I did last 
year, that will let people know."

UNION, MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS FREEZE ON SIGNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eugene Orza, associate general counsel of the baseball players' union, said 
Wednesday he expects to continue conversations with management officials today 
on the owners' request for a 45-day freeze on contract signings and a delay in 
the start of free-agent filing from Saturday to Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Orza said collective bargaining, tentatively scheduled to resume 
today, would probably not resume until next week because of business and travel 
commitments by many of the key people. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that the union would not make a decision on the freeze until 
Tuesday or Wednesday and that eligible players would be advised to hold off 
filing until then. The union believes the freeze is designed strictly to give 
owners time to decide what provisions they want to retain in the salary-cap 
proposal they plan to implement and to shorten the off-season decision time for 
prospective free agents and players in general. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners, citing the possibility of a bargaining agreement or eventual 
implementation of the salary-cap proposal, say the freeze would prevent the 
possibility of players signing under two sets of rules while giving the two 
sides an extended period to concentrate on negotiations. Management lawyers 
have said they will consider imposing the freeze unilaterally if it is 
rejected, an act that would probably prompt the union to file a collusion 
grievance. ROSS NEWHAN

RANGERS ADD KENNEDY TO FIRED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Texas Ranger Manager Kevin Kennedy, whose team led the American League West 
despite a losing record when the strike started, was fired Wednesday, two days 
after the hiring of a general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "My gut feeling was that I wanted to start with a clean slate in preparation 
for next season," General Manager Doug Melvin said."I'm hoping to heck that 
Kevin lands somewhere. He shouldn't have to go back to the minor leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy was the fourth manager to be fired since the players went on strike 
Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't surprised," Kennedy said. "I understand change, it's part of the 
business. I have no regrets. I wish the best for Doug Melvin and the Texas 
Rangers, except when they're playing against us--whoever I may be." 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Scott, who had spent the last 10 years as director of player development 
for the Rangers, also was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas was 52-62 and in first place in the weak AL West when the season 
stopped. The Rangers had lost six in a row before the strike, and their lead 
over Oakland had been cut to one game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, 40, leaves with an overall 138-138 record. He has one year at 
$250,000 left on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvin has a list of candidates, but would not reveal any names. He did not 
deny reported possibilities such as former Baltimore Oriole manager Johnny 
Oates, Oriole bench coach Jerry Narron, Cleveland Indian pitching coach Phil 
Regan and Pittsburgh Pirate coach Bill Virdon. (Southland Edition) Revolving

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; COLORADO STATE CONVINCES COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His heart rate down to medically accepted levels, Colorado State Coach Sonny 
Lubick issued an apology of sorts Monday to his undefeated and 13th-ranked 
Rams, who upset heavily favored Arizona, 21-16, last Saturday at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Lubick said he was sorry he ever doubted his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were genuine and they were convinced they could beat those guys," Lubick 
said. "But I'm still thinking, 'Geez, I hope we don't get blown out.' I mean, 
that's a great team we were playing. But after a while I'm saying, 'What the 
hell am I doing? Am I really selling our kids short?' " 
</P>
<P>
 If it makes Lubick feel any better, everyone doubted Colorado State's chances 
of beating the Wildcats. In fact, days later Lubick still can't completely 
understand how a second-year coach with a Western Athletic Conference team that 
finished 5-6 a season ago defeated Desert Swarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ask me for the truth and I'll give it to you: I was surprised," said 
Lubick, a former Miami defensive coordinator who left Coral Gables for Ft. 
Collins and a considerable rebuilding project. 
</P>
<P>
 So hyped was Lubick after the victory that he stayed up nearly all night 
watching an ESPN replay of the Hurricanes' victory over Florida State. "I got 
in bed and my heart was still pounding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day he talked to several Miami assistant coaches and even received a 
congratulatory fax from the owners of a hole-in-the-wall bar where the 
Hurricane staff used to go for a few pops. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ft. Collins is just now regaining its composure. Police had to be 
called in during the wee hours of Sunday because of dancing in the streets by 
Colorado State students and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had that here," Lubick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Get used to it, especially if Colorado State, which already has beaten two 
ranked teams (Arizona and Brigham Young), can squeeze past No. 21 Utah on Oct. 
22 at Ft. Collins. SPURRIER VS. THE BOWDENS 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't seem that Florida Coach Steve Spurrier is too fond of Auburn Coach 
Terry Bowden, or the entire family, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurrier bristled at comparisons between him and Bowden, especially when it 
came to offensive sophistication. Read between the smug look and here's the 
translation: Florida's attack is state of the art, while Auburn's is--to steal 
a line from Howard Cosell--from the age of Magellan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not real fancy, but they take care of the ball real well," Spurrier 
allowed, adding later that Auburn runs Florida State's "old" offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurrier did praise Auburn defensive coordinator Wayne Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm coaching against Wayne Hall this week," Spurrier said. "(Gator defensive 
coordinator) Bob Pruett will be coaching against Coach Bowden." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Auburn, winner of its last 17 games, travels to Gainesville for a 
Saturday game against the No. 1-ranked Gators. Auburn upset Florida last 
season, which means Spurrier has lost four of his last five games against 
Bowdens. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of the Bowdens. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 According to Terry, there is no truth to the report that his mother, Ann, is 
rooting for Florida to win Saturday, thus keeping alive the possibility of No. 
1 Florida against once-beaten Florida State, coached by husband Bobby Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother and brothers-in-law are coaching on this team, too," Terry Bowden 
said. "I'd put money on it: She couldn't stand watching us lose Saturday. 
You're talking about a momma who used to make daddy sleep on the couch when dad 
wouldn't put me in a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry used to play for his father. CLIP-AND-SAVE CHECKLIST 
</P>
<P>
 And now, 10 reasons to attend an exciting Pacific 10 Conference game: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Chance to root for your favorite Western Athletic Conference team. The 
Lack-10 is a combined 2-6 against the supposedly lesser WAC. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Get really good deal on leftover Sports Illustrated issues naming Arizona 
preseason No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Make beeline for pregame rummage sale of J.J. Stokes, Steve Stenstrom and 
Rob Johnson Heisman publicity stills. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Submit nickname entry for Washington State defense. Apple Swarm? 
</P>
<P>
 5) Calculate possibility of Lack-10 unable to fulfill postseason bowl 
commitments. There are four bowls available--Rose, Alamo, Freedom and a 
coalition choice (probably the Hancock)--but might not be enough teams with the 
NCAA-required six Division I-A victories to qualify. Washington can't go 
anywhere because of probation. Stanford (1-3-1), Oregon State (1-4), Oregon 
(3-3, but one of the victories is over Division I-AA Portland State), Arizona 
State (2-3) and probably UCLA (2-4) are cooked. USC (3-2) is doomed if it 
doesn't win its next two against Stanford and California. With no Dave Barr, 
Cal (3-2) becomes a bubble team. The only sure things: Arizona and Washington 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 6) Chance to ask Stanford Coach Bill Walsh if electroshock scene from 
"Brubaker" is his favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 7) Listen to Teflon Coach Terry Donahue explain how a team one season removed 
from a Rose Bowl can fall to pieces because of no Stokes. Nebraska is down to a 
third-string quarterback and the Cornhuskers still are winning. 
</P>
<P>
 8) Root for Washington tailback Napoleon Kaufman. He'll be the only Husky 
making a postseason appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 9) Sign petition requesting Pac-10 to forget about future plans to recruit 
Texas to league; instead, push for Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
 10) Mock USC for insisting on no-repeat Freedom Bowl rule. The arrogant 
Trojans will be lucky if they're playing anywhere after the regular season. THE 
LUMBERING GOURMET 
</P>
<P>
 Back by popular demand--and because the NCAA said it wasn't against the 
rules--Florida offensive tackle Anthony Ingrassia has resumed his weekly 
restaurant review column in the student newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "Anthony Digests," the column doesn't waste time on fine dining, but 
instead explores the world of all-you-can-eat buffets and 30-minute-or-less 
pizza deliveries. Using the helmet rating system (five helmets means culinary 
excellence), the 6-foot-2, 296-pound Ingrassia is picky about his tastes. When 
a pizza arrived in unsatisfactory condition, Ingrassia wrote that the toppings 
were so covered with oil and grease "that pictures of workers rescuing sea 
otters and birds come to mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The column was suspended in September as violation-sensitive Florida officials 
checked to make sure Ingrassia wasn't violating the NCAA's business-endorsement 
rule. He wasn't, which is why Ingrassia, who once ate 13 bowls of spaghetti in 
a single sitting, is back in print. 
</P>
<P>
 "People still don't really know who I am," Ingrassia said. "But once I place 
the order, I see people peeking out of the kitchen once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 For pure volume, the all-you-can-eat spaghetti restaurants are his favorite. 
However, he did visit a Taco Bell once and ordered every item off the menu. 
Teammate Donnie Young witnessed another eat-fest when Ingrassia ate an entire 
chicken. "There was nothing but bones left," he said. "He ate the cartilage and 
everything." READ IT AND WEEP 
</P>
<P>
 Things we thought we'd never see: Duke at 5-0, Colorado State at 6-0 and, of 
course, Kansas State ranked No. 16, followed by Notre Dame at No. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next, Joe Paterno wearing contacts? 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, Irish Coach Lou Holtz scrambling for explanations to a 4-2 
record and another upset loss to Boston College will have to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that I have mentioned I think our talent level is down," he said. "I 
don't think there is any doubt about that. Our problem on offense is not 
running the ball up the middle. Our problem is maybe we are trying to please 
other people. Maybe we are trying to say, 'OK, we got this talent and that 
talent, let us do this and that.' We don't execute and we don't take a physical 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
 This is Notre Dame's lowest ranking since 1991. The Irish are out of the 
national championship race and are considering a handful of lineup and 
philosophical changes. Here's a prediction: Even with fullback Ray Zellars 
definitely sidelined and tailback Lee Becton questionable for Saturday's game 
against BYU, look for Holtz to run the ball until the Cougars drop. And if 
you're quarterback Ron Powlus, expect Holtz to be in your face every time you 
make a mistake in practice. The cooler, calmer Holtz is history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I speak from the heart," Holtz said this week. "I have not spoken with the 
staff yet and we haven't had a staff meeting yet. I have just studied the film 
in depth, made a lot of notes and got to talk to the staff, but we need to 
evaluate everything from top to bottom; what we are doing and how we are doing 
it and why we are doing it, including our approach in practice." THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas State's No. 11 ranking in the coaches' poll is its highest ever. The 
previous best was No. 12 in the Associated Press poll in 1969. Reason for the 
rise: Coach Bill Snyder's decision to pursue quarterback Chad May, who wanted 
out of Cal State Fullerton when the Titans switched to an option offense. May, 
who hasn't thrown an interception in his last 166 passes and has at least one 
touchdown pass in each of his last 15 games, is the Big Eight Conference's best 
passer. Snyder also made a recruiting run at Brook Berringer, whose status is 
up in the air for Nebraska against Kansas State on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A loud annoying noise briefly interrupted a conference call with Miami Coach 
Dennis Erickson. "Is that Lee Corso on the line?" Erickson said of the ESPN 
analyst. "I've had enough of him." Erickson shouldn't be so hard on the former 
coach--Corso picked Miami to beat Florida State. . . . Hurricane quarterback 
Frank Costa didn't know it, but he was close to losing the confidence of his 
teammates. "He needed to prove to us he could win a big-time football game," 
Hurricane tackle Zev Lumelski said, "and he did." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange Bowl Committee had no choice but to move its bowl game from the 
historic but outdated Orange Bowl to the more comfortable Joe Robbie Stadium on 
the Dade-Broward county line. If the committee had voted otherwise, the bowl 
alliance would have cut the Orange Bowl off at the knees and replaced it in the 
new national championship rotation with the Gator Bowl. "The soul of Miami is 
being sold down the river," Miami City Manager Cesar Odio told reporters. "You 
don't see the Rose Bowl moving. I'd like to see them run the Kentucky Derby 
somewhere else." Nice try, but facts are facts: The Orange Bowl, dedicated in 
1937, has crummy parking, is in a so-so neighborhood, is luxury suite-poor, has 
tiny locker-room facilities and a press box to match. Top 10

PACIFIC 10 FOOTBALL / DAN HAFNER; EXPERTS WERE WRONG ABOUT WASHINGTON STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The experts who predict how good football teams are going to be couldn't see 
much good about Washington State this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars were deemed a candidate for Steve Harvey's Bottom Ten. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other Pacific 10 Conference teams might belong with the losers, 
but Mike Price's team isn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 A near-unanimous choice to finish last in the Pac-10, the Cougars are suddenly 
in a position to grab the favorite's role in the run to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 After beating Oregon last week, the Cougars can move into the driver's seat by 
beating Arizona on Saturday at Pullman, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory would give the Cougars a 3-0 conference record and help them clear a 
big hurdle to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona-Washington State game has long been billed as a battle of great 
defenses. They had been 1-2 in the conference and among the leaders in the 
nation on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is some question about the Wildcat defense after the Colorado State 
game. In adding to the Western Athletic Conference's superiority over the 
Pac-10 this season, unbeaten Colorado State had little trouble moving the ball 
or scoring in a 21-16 victory that ended the Wildcats' hopes for an unbeaten 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State gained 314 yards, 251 in the air. All season, Arizona Coach 
Dick Tomey hasbelieved something was missing on defense, and the game proved 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State, led by All-American DeWayne Patterson, has not given up more 
than one touchdown in a game, but several teams have found flaws in the Arizona 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thus far, we have not fulfilled our expectations in quality of play or in 
intensity," Tomey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The better team won last week. But a good team will come back strong after a 
poor performance. We will see if our team can do that. You may not necessarily 
win, but a good team will play better. We have a special group of guys that I 
think will respond to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tall order for us. Right now, the Cougars are playing the best 
football in our league. I don't know whether we can go up to Pullman and win. 
But we will be pretty upset if we don't go up there and play a good game." 
</P>
<P>
 The game is not likely to be won on the ground. The Cougars are No. 3 in the 
nation against the run, giving up only 56.8 yards per game. The Wildcats are 
sixth, yielding 71.4.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars are tops in the nation in scoring defense, yielding only 5.8 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars don't score a lot of points, either. They have scored only 10 
touchdowns in five games, and linebackers Mark Fields and Ron Childs have one 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to improve our offense, because this is the toughest defense 
we've faced," Price said. "This one could be decided by a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has not exactly been a golden season for the California Bears. Even before 
training camp, tragedy struck and now Coach Keith Gilbertson has lost his star. 
</P>
<P>
 There was much gloom on the squad when several Bears were injured in an auto 
accident. Starting linebacker Paul Joiner was almost killed in the accident, 
which ended his career. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Dave Barr, the outstanding quarterback, suffered a broken collarbone 
when he was slammed to the ground by UCLA's Donnie Edwards in the second 
quarter last Saturday, it was another bitter blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the convincing 26-7 victory over the Bruins gave the Bears a 2-0 
record in conference play, there is no joy in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr, the team leader and one of the nation's top passers, is probably 
sidelined for the season. Left-handed junior Kerry McConigal proved a capable 
replacement against the Bruins, but once the Bears had more than a touchdown 
lead, they didn't let him throw another pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Oregon has worse quarterback problems than Cal, the Ducks will put 
considerably more pressure on McConigal on Saturday than the Bruins did. 
</P>
<P>
 In their loss at Washington State, the Ducks' starter, Tony Graziani, who 
played so well against USC in his first start, was sidelined early because of a 
sprained ankle. Danny O'Neil, who hadn't taken a snap from center for two weeks 
because of a finger injury, was pressed into action. Against the Cougars' 
powerful defense, O'Neil didn't have a chance. He completed only four of 20 
passes and the Cougars won handily, 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Rich Brooks' team lose Graziani early, but also Cristin McLemore, 
its best receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to hand it to the Cougars," Brooks said. "They are a good, tough 
football team, but with our injuries we never had a chance. We didn't have a 
chance to fire all our bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny's timing was off and we couldn't protect him from their great pass 
rush. He'll be better Saturday, but we won't have Graziani or McLemore. We 
could be in for a rugged afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While many of the highly touted Pac-10 quarterbacks are falling by the 
wayside, either because of poor performances, injury or both, Stanford's Steve 
Stenstrom continues to break records. 
</P>
<P>
 The new all-time yardage leader in the Pac-10 has passed for more than 300 
yards in 12 of the last 15 games. He is No. 3 in the nation, averaging 300 
yards total offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Another quarterback doing quite well is Arizona State's Jake Plummer. Plummer 
drove the Sun Devils into position for a 38-yard field goal by Jon Baker that 
beat Stanford with six seconds left, 36-35. Plummer was faced with a 
fourth-down situation three times during the drive from the Sun Devils' 22, and 
he converted all three. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have said it before. Jake is a terrific quarterback," Coach Bruce Snyder 
said. "But even more than that, he is one of the best competitors I have ever 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The look in his eye when he dove past the marker on the fourth-and-12 run was 
something I'll never forget. He knew he had to make the play to give us a 
chance and he did it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's Napoleon Kaufman continued his run for the Heisman Trophy last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was expected to be a breather against San Jose State, Kaufman almost 
single-handedly prevented a major upset. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies didn't put the Spartans away until Kaufman, who had a 91-yard run 
on the Huskies' first play, ran 76 yards for another touchdown with 6:07 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just took the game and won it for us," Coach Jim Lambright said.

TONIGHT'S NFL GAME; OILERS HOPE TO RETAIN SERIES EDGE AS BROWNS TRY TO KEEP 
MOMENTUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Houston Oilers have a legacy to fulfill. The Cleveland Browns have one to 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers are at the same starting point -- 1-4 -- as a season ago, when they 
won their last 11 games and their second consecutive AFC Central title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns are 4-1 but have a history of fading in the stretch. But they hope 
to avoid another collapse beginning tonight, when they try to beat the Oilers 
for only the second time in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns, after three seasons of turmoil under Coach Bill Belichick, are 
beginning to see results. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns have a 7-17 combined record in the second half of the last three 
seasons under Belichick. They started last season 5-2 and finished 2-7. In 
1992, they started 4-3 and finished 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Belichick now feels comfortable enough to loosen the reins.

ANALYSIS; MILLER GETS THE NOD, SURPRISING CHANDLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Miller was named the Rams' starting quarterback Wednesday, and Coach 
Chuck Knox said there was never any doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, however, Knox said he would wait until Wednesday, review medical 
updates and then make his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 What decision? Miller was sound and coming off a solid performance against the 
Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 After listing Chris Chandler as questionable Wednesday for Sunday's game 
against the New York Giants because of a sore ankle, Knox summoned Miller to 
his office and told him he would be starting. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Knox call Jerome Bettis to his office? Robert Young? Flipper Anderson? If 
Miller is the team's acknowledged No. 1 quarterback, why did Knox meet 
separately with Miller and Chandler on Wednesday? Why is there a feeling at 
Rams Park that Miller is on a short leash, and one slip-up and Chandler is in 
command? Why did Chandler report to work Wednesday believing he was going to be 
named the starter? 
</P>
<P>
 "How could there be any question?" Knox said. "Chris Miller is the starting 
quarterback, he was the starting quarterback, he got hurt. He's back to being 
the starting quarterback. OK? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to get into short leashes, long leashes, next week, the end of 
the year and all that type of stuff that you people want so you can put 
somebody in a trick bag. That's not what I'm talking about. He is the starting 
quarterback. I can't make it any more emphatic than that." 
</P>
<P>
 It's no secret, however, that Knox has high regard for Chandler and that he 
has become irritated with Miller's penchant for making excuses when things do 
not go well. It has been mentioned by several of his assistants and it has been 
discussed in the team's front office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never said that," Knox said. "I have never said that I favored one 
quarterback over the other. That is not known, because I have never said it. 
You can hear that from this person or that person, but you never heard it from 
me. So you're asking me now, and I'm telling: Yes, I have said we can win with 
Chris Chandler because I feel we can. I said that when Chris Miller was out and 
was not going to be playing. Just like we can win with Chris Miller, and Chris 
Miller played well, and he is the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not dealing in perceptions. I'm talking with reality, and I've just 
answered the questions." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams gave Miller $9 million for three years to replace Jim Everett, and 
then gave Chandler a one-year contract for $600,000 to be Miller's backup. 
There should be no debate, but after six games the gap between starter and 
backup has all but disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came in today I anticipated I was going to be going as the starter 
this week," said Chandler, who led the Rams to a 16-0 victory over the Kansas 
City Chiefs on Sept. 25. "But I understand Chuck's thought that he would like 
to see it in practice first, that I can go on the ankle. I just know the ankle 
feels like it's going to be ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 If Chandler, who has completed 58.7% of his passes with two touchdowns and no 
interceptions, were 100% sound, would Knox have made him his starter? 
</P>
<P>
 Knox doesn't answer hypothetical questions, but it appears Miller's stock has 
plummeted for a variety of reasons: Miller has completed 50% of his passes with 
four touchdowns and five interceptions; he has shown an inability to stay free 
of injury; and when asked questions, he has elected to answer honestly rather 
than respond with football cliches. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's pretty good when he's healthy," said Mike Martz, Ram quarterback coach. 
"I don't think he's ever been himself since the first week of camp. I know he 
hasn't. Some unfortunate things have happened to him; he's just kind of an 
unlucky guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller injured an abdominal muscle early in training camp and his play 
deteriorated. He suffered a rib injury in the regular-season opener against 
Arizona, and after receiving painkilling injections to continue playing, he 
injured his shoulder against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to start against Green Bay after sitting out the second game 
against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big difference now in the way he's throwing the ball," Martz said. 
"He's getting it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very fortunate to have both of them (Miller and Chandler). The other 
guy is a legitimate starter in this league." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Miller: "I felt I played well Sunday and now I'm planning on playing well 
and putting all that other stuff behind us. I expect to pick this team up and 
help win the next two games and be where we want to be at the bye with an 
opportunity to do some good things during the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are searching right now; that happens when a team goes 2-4. 
Mentally, it's been hard on me just because I haven't been 100% physically and 
that's showed in my play. And then, when you're not on the field, how the hell 
can you be a leader? I'm back now, and that's what I plan on doing."

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; IT'S BACK UP THE HILL FOR MCDANIEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In Greek mythology, Sisyphus was the greedy king who was condemned to hell, 
where his punishment was to push a boulder uphill for eternity, only to have it 
roll down to the bottom again. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry McDaniel knows how he feels. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week, the Raider cornerback spends hours on the practice field and in 
front of a videotape recorder, studying and preparing to face an NFL 
quarterback. Once game day is done and his job is finished, he must start all 
over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, McDaniel successfully pushed over a boulder by the name of Drew 
Bledsoe, intercepting three passes by the New England Patriot and returning one 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, along comes Miami Dolphin quarterback Dan Marino, whose receivers 
include Irving Fryar and Mark Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're used to it," said McDaniel, who has five interceptions and has scored 
three touchdowns. "That's the routine. When the game's over, it's over. You'll 
think about it maybe that night. It'll float through (your mind) some, but 
you've got to go and prepare for the next week. No matter if it was a good 
game, bad game or who you're facing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never a time for a letup. Each week, you've got to put out more 
(effort), because the weeks are going by and there's really more wear and tear 
on your body. You've just got to focus more and get ready for the next 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel's study routine includes talking to his own receivers to acquire even 
more information. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would you think, Tim," he might ask Tim Brown, "if I played you like 
this in a certain situation?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Running back Greg Robinson, on the physically unable to perform list while he 
recuperates from a knee injury, is eligible to come off this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't look for him soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels better," he said of the knee, "but it's still a little weak."

ST. LOUIS OFFICIALS OFFER RAMS VERY LUCRATIVE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DIGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 St. Louis officials spent 4 1/2 hours with Ram President John Shaw on 
Wednesday, attempting to woo the executive with a lucrative relocation offer 
that would make the Rams one of the NFL's most profitable franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Eagleton, the former U.S. Senator who headed the four-man St. Louis 
delegation, said the discussion focused primarily on the big-ticket items of a 
wish list the Rams sent the city in August. St. Louis responded with a 25-page 
proposal outlining a plan to raise at least $60 million, through a 
permanent-seat licensing program, to cover costs associated with a move. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton said the Rams seemed "more and more interested" in the St Louis 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our proposal responded directly to the wish list," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis, which has promised the Rams virtually all revenues from the 
$258-million, 70,000-seat domed stadium currently under construction in the 
city, is attempting to raise enough money to cover some $30 million the Rams 
still owe for Anaheim Stadium improvements made in 1980, about $15 million for 
a new practice facility and an estimated $15 million in NFL relocation fees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, it is believed St. Louis has offered to spend another $6 million 
to speed construction of the domed stadium so it can be ready for the beginning 
of the 1995 season. It has been scheduled to be completed in late October, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We answered various questions about stadium size, the shape it's in, could it 
be completed by the open of the season, and how many other luxury boxes could 
be put on top," Eagleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw declined comment on the meeting, other than to say, "They made an offer 
to us, and we hope to review it and get back to them."

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; SHOULDER INJURIES CONCERN GILBERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Sean Gilbert was scheduled to undergo tests on both shoulders 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert left Sunday's game in the first quarter after aggravating shoulder 
injuries and, after Gilbert sat out practice Wednesday, teammate Robert Young 
had to help Gilbert lift the T-shirt over his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I concerned? It's my job," Gilbert said. "If something is wrong, it will 
have to be fixed. I can't sit here and whine. I can't go out and give my 100% 
if I'm hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams moved rookie free agent D'Marco Farr into Gilbert's position for 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Jimmie Jones, who has been playing alongside Gilbert, sat out 
practice because of a bruised hip but is expected to play against the New York 
Giants on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why have the Rams lost four of six games? Listen to the coaches and it's 
because they haven't played rookie Wayne Gandy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we can win the game with Wayne Gandy," offensive line coach Jim 
Erkenbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's the case, why did the Rams play Darryl Ashmore earlier and keep 
Gandy on the bench? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ashmore has more experience, not more talent," Erkenbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashmore is back and ready to go, but Erkenbeck said Gandy has practice 
experience now and will start at right tackle in place of an injured Jackie 
Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Jerome Bettis, who wore a pad around his midsection to protect a 
bruised back against Green Bay, practiced Wednesday without any hint of 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 This week Bettis will be matched against the fourth-ranked rushing defense in 
the league, and he will be running behind a makeshift offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 "How will the new guys come in and play?" Bettis said. "That's the key. Last 
year we had injuries and the backups came in and played like starters and we 
were able to roll on." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Running back David Lang will sit out Sunday's game because of a hamstring 
injury and wide receiver Todd Kinchen will take his place returning kicks. T.J.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; PACKERS PULLING OUT OF MILWAUKEE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Green Bay Packers are abandoning Milwaukee, where they have played part of 
their schedule since the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Team President Bob Harlan said the Packers will play their full home schedule 
in Green Bay and will not renew their lease on aging County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the Packers have played one exhibition and three 
regular-season games at County Stadium, home of baseball's Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 County Stadium lacks luxury-box seating; the Packers have 108 boxes at Lambeau 
Field, with 90 more being built. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to take full advantage of our stadium," Harlan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision leaves the NFL without a presence in Milwaukee for the first time 
since 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kent Cooke's plan to move his Washington Redskins to Laurel, Md., 
suffered a serious setback when a zoning officer rejected his application to 
build a 78,600-seat stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a close case," Robert Wilcox, the hearing officer, said. "Simply 
stated, the property is too small for the proposed use." 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins quickly filed an appeal and issued a statement from Cooke saying 
he intends to "vigorously pursue our object of building the (stadium). Wilcox's 
decision provides us with a road map to cure the faults he envisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium opponents were jubilant about the ruling, but said they were aware the 
fight is not over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The New Orleans Saints turned their trade of a cornerback into a cornerback 
swap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints, worried they would lose Reginald Jones to free agency in the 
off-season, traded him to the Cleveland Browns on Tuesday for an undisclosed 
draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, they claimed Selwyn Jones, the cornerback the Browns cut to make 
room for Jones.

 Quarterback John Elway was one of three players held out of practice as the 
Denver Broncos began gearing toward Monday night's game against Kansas City. 
Elway, who has a jammed and bruised right thumb, was expected to resume 
workouts today. . . . Philadelphia Eagle rookie Charlie Garner, seeking to 
become the first running back in NFL history to rush for 100 yards in each of 
his first three games, said he's not sure if an injured rib will keep him out 
of Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys. . . . David Klingler wants to 
throw 50 passes a game to try to break the Cincinnati Bengals out of the 
winless category, but Coach Dave Shula told him to forget it.

GUILTY PLEA BY MCNALL ACCOUNTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert J. Houston, a former accountant for King President Bruce McNall, 
pleaded guilty Wednesday to single counts of bank fraud, wire fraud and 
conspiracy, agreeing to cooperate with federal prosecutors in the ongoing 
investigation into McNall's banking practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston, 44, faces a maximum prison term of 40 years, five years of supervised 
release and a $1.5-million fine, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter G. 
Spivack. U.S. District Judge Richard Paez set a sentencing date of Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Paez accepted a request from Houston's attorney, David Reed, to seal the plea 
agreement, which stems in part from the fact that Houston is cooperating with 
the government. Reed said he will not comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston, the second McNall business associate to plead guilty, helped McNall 
secure more than $150 million in loans by preparing and filing false tax 
returns and financial statements, starting as far back as January 1986, 
according to court documents. McNall's former vice president and controller, 
Joanna Orehek, pleaded guilty in August to single counts of wire fraud and 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Houston admitted to helping defraud four banks -- European American 
Bank, the French bank Credit Lyonnais, Bank of America and Union Bank -- with 
tax returns and financial statements that inflated McNall's income and assets 
and understated or failed to report outstanding loans. An earlier allegation 
involving First Bank Los Angeles was dropped.

MIGHTY DUCK FORWARD CARNBACK LOOKING INTO A RETURN TO SWEDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mighty Duck forward Patrik Carnback is pursuing opportunities to play in 
Sweden, agent Neil Abbott said Wednesday, the day after the NHL rejected the 
players' latest bargaining proposal, signaling a potentially lengthy lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it's unclear whether the Swedish Elite League will accept NHL 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still waiting for an official statement from the NHL," Tommy Topel, 
president of the Swedish league, told the Associated Press on Wednesday. "I 
expect an overnight fax. We have to listen to the NHL first because we have an 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira has said Carnback would be violating his 
contract if he plays in Europe, but Abbott said he will ask Ferreira to loan 
Carnback to a team in his native Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this season is going to be shot, to tell the truth," Abbott said. "I 
don't think there's any realistic chance of the NHL playing in the short term, 
meaning the next two to four months." 
</P>
<P>
 Carnback, 26, played professionally in Sweden for six seasons before getting 
12 goals and 11 assists for the Ducks in his first full NHL season. But Abbott 
said he is advising Carnback to play abroad because he hasn't developed into a 
top NHL player and because he was preparing to play out the option year of a 
contract that was scheduled to pay him $200,000 this season. ROBYN NORWOOD

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; BENNETT'S HOPES HIGH AFTER LEGAL WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He walked on the practice field Wednesday for the first time this season, 
talked with Coach Terry Donahue and then left. Tommy Bennett is still on the 
outside looking in -- on football, on school, on life -- and there is little 
Donahue can do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett was counted on to start at safety until his arrest in the spring, and 
his sentence to 300 hours of community service and three years' probation after 
pleading no-contest to charges of making a false financial statement and grand 
theft has left him in academic limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 His case is in the office of UCLA's dean of students, who will decide if 
Bennett can re-enter school. If he is allowed to do so, it is then up to the 
athletic department whether Bennett can return to football. 
</P>
<P>
 This season is pretty much out. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants next season -- badly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the Tennessee game (the opener) and watched, and I left," he said. 
"I couldn't take it. I've played since I was 7 years old, and it feels empty 
not to be playing." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the kids. Bennett received a mayor's award for working with 
children in San Diego, and he relished spending time with young patients at the 
UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a big kid myself," he said. "Maybe the hardest thing I've had to do is to 
tell kids what I did was wrong, and that I am sorry for it." 
</P>
<P>
 He needed money, he said, because of family problems at home. "I was having 
problems with financial aid and I was broke," he said. "But that's not a 
reason. It's an excuse. I shouldn't have done it." 
</P>
<P>
 His scholarship gone, he lives with Teddy Lawrence, a UCLA and San Diego Morse 
High teammate, and works as a security guard and at odd jobs to keep going. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has learned his lesson. "I'll be working a lot of community hours 
to think about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he wants to pass a lesson along, one he has learned the hard way. "If 
there's one thing I would tell the young guys," Bennett said, "it's to take 
advantage of what you have while you have it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball Coach Jim Harrick, who has his own practice to worry about 
beginning Saturday, visited Wednesday's football practice. . . . The Bruins 
list 10 defensive backs on their depth chart, and eight of them are freshmen or 
sophomores. Cornerback Lawrence and reserve safety Ted Nwoke are juniors, and 
there are no seniors. . . . A sign of the times on a 2-4 team: Of the 60 
players UCLA took to California to play Saturday, seven were walk-ons. . . . 
Fullback James Milliner is practicing at full contact again, and another 
fullback, Greg Ford, expects to be able to play Saturday against Oregon State.

 Senior wide receiver Ed Hervey, who has sat out every game since the 
Washington opener because of a knee injury, and junior tailback Leonard Green, 
a sensation in training camp, will be available Saturday against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Green suffered a hamstring pull in August, twice tried to come back too soon 
and aggravated the injury.

<P>
 Stanford Coach Bill Walsh was asked about the pounding his quarterback, Steve 
Stenstrom, has taken so far -- particularly with so many Pacific 10 
quarterbacks being injured this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned for him," he said. "You watch the tape and you wonder how he

more than you'd like."

 The University of Kansas soon will have a new goal post that its fans would 
rather not have. It is a present from archrival Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildcat fans celebrating the end of a 25-year victory drought in Kansas' 
Memorial Stadium tore down the north goal post after Kansas State's 21-13 
victory on Saturday in Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas State Athletic Director Max Urick apologized for the incident the next 
day and offered to pay for replacing and installing a new goal post. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal post costs about $2,700, Kansas spokesman Doug Vance said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildcat fans also put purple dye in a fountain at Kansas, and 11 Kansas State 
students were caught trying to spray paint the area around the Kansas Union 
purple -- incurring the editorial outrage of the Kansas student newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no significant damage from game-related events, Vance said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas is on the road this week but will need the new goal post for its Oct. 
22 home game against the Oklahoma Sooners.

THE BOTTOM TEN / STEVE HARVEY: OTHER POLL STEALS LAUGHS THIS WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing makes the Bottom Ten selectors angrier than when the Top 25 ratings 
try to be funny. But the New York Times Computer Rankings succeeded this week 
when it declared Kansas State No. 1 in the nation. That's No. 1 among the best 
teams. Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, at least the Bottom Ten still has Houston (0-5) to place-kick around. 
The Cougars absorbed their 10th consecutive loss, a 7-38 rout at the hands, 
feet, knees and elbows of Texas A&M. The game marked the 100th anniversary of 
A&M's first game, a 14-6 victory over Galveston's Ball High on Oct. 8, 1894.  
</P>
<P>
 As the score indicates, Ball High provided stiffer competition than Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Right behind Houston is Arkansas State, which advanced with a 0-26 loss to 
Southwest Louisiana, a school that is so obscure that Bottom Ten officials were 
unable to determine what state it is located in. 
</P>
<P>
 The rankings: 03,23,21,14 Rk. School, Record Last Loss Next Loss 1. Houston 
(0-5) 7-38, Texas A&M SMU 2. Ark State (1-5) 0-26 SW Louisiana Memphis 3. Iowa

Bottom Ten (which once had the 3-2 Cal Bears ranked No. 1). 
</P>
<P>
 Crummy Game of the Week (maybe the year): Houston (0-5) vs. SMU (1-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Mandatory one-week suspension (for winning a game): New Mexico (1-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Dishonorable Mention: The Pac 10, which is 2-6 vs. WAC teams. THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
 It's like they always say about the NFL: On any given Sunday, a Shula-coached 
team can lose. Even when Dave's Bungles have the week off. 
</P>
<P>
 Don's Miami club lost to Buffalo last Sunday. And Cincinnati renews its quest 
to become the first 0-16 team in NFL history Sunday when it plays the Pitts. 
Don't be fooled by Cincy's fast start, though. Last year, the Bungles raced out 
to an 0-10 beginning only to wind up winning three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstaff Coach Buddy Ryan, meanwhile, said he had placed his entire team on 
the physically-unable-to-perform list, raising doubts whether the Cardinals 
will score again this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, again, the team has tallied only 49 points in its first five games. This 
despite Ryan's memorable vow to reporters of a few weeks ago: "I think you're 
going to see a different Eagle offense next week." The scary thing is he was 
speaking of the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The rankings: BOTTOM TEN SIX-PACK 03,22,17,12 Rk. Team, Record Last Loss Next

BUCKNER HELPS UCLA DEFEAT USC IN WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The UCLA women's volleyball team needed a remarkable effort Wednesday to stave 
off USC. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what it got from Annett Buckner. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckner had a career-high 37 kills to lead UCLA to a 13-15, 9-15, 16-14, 
15-13, 15-9 Pacific 10 Conference victory before 2,047 at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has not lost to USC in 13 matches since Nov. 24, 1987. But the 
third-ranked Bruins, 16-2 overall and 6-1 in the Pac-10, played poorly at the 
start and watched the Trojans reach match point in the third game. 
</P>
<P>
 With USC leading, 14-12, Monika Cavaliere served for the match, but a kill by 
Kelly Flannigan kept UCLA's hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a really unwise thing in Game 3," said USC Coach Lisa Love, whose team 
is 10-4 and 4-3. "We haven't been in that position at UCLA too often and we 
committed a cardinal sin. We celebrated too early." 
</P>
<P>
 Buckner took advantage of the opportunity. She seemed to hang in the air for 
the rest of the game, slamming down four kills and serving an ace to spark the 
Bruins' comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just hung around," said UCLA Coach Andy Banachowski. "I don't think we 
played a great match by any means, but we just stayed in there and we didn't 
give up. We didn't want to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Buckner's 37 kills rank second behind the UCLA record of 43 set by Natalie 
Williams in a match against Hawaii in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was definitely an emotional high," Buckner said. "Besides winning 
the national championship (in 1991), I think this is the second-most exciting."

DOCTORS MOVE USC'S RAVELING OUT OF INTENSIVE CARE UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After spending nine days in intensive care, USC basketball Coach George 
Raveling was moved into a private room at USC University Hospital on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, 57, broke nine ribs, his pelvis and collarbone and suffered a 
collapsed lung when his Jeep Cherokee was totaled in a traffic accident near 
the USC campus on Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 He was placed in intensive care on Oct. 2, after doctors discovered bleeding 
in his chest cavity. 
</P>
<P>
 "George Raveling is recovering very well," said Demetrios Demetriades, trauma 
director at the hospital. "He is in stable condition, but there is still a 
slight problem with the lung bruising due to multiple fractured ribs and 
underlying conditions from the accident. His recovery is being monitored 
closely. By next week, we hope to make an evaluation as to when he'll be 
released from the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 With USC scheduled to begin practice for the 1994-95 season Saturday, 
assistant head coaches Charlie Parker and Jack Fertig, along with assistant 
Adrian Walters, will coach the team while Raveling recovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie and Jack are great coaches -- they should already be head coaches -- 
so I don't have one ounce of concern about practice going well," Raveling said 
in a statement. "Our entire staff will do a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 USC's first game of the season is set for Nov. 16, when the Trojans play host 
to New Mexico State in the first round of the preseason National Invitation 
Tournament.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: PENHALL, SIGALOS TRY TO CONQUER WORLD OF OFFSHORE 
BOAT RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruce Penhall of Laguna Hills and Dennis Sigalos of Newport Beach, both world 
champions in speedway motorcycle racing, are now after similar honors in 
offshore powerboat racing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1982 World Speedway Final at the Coliseum, Penhall was the winner and 
Sigalos was third. The same year, Sigalos won the World Pairs championship and 
the two were teammates on the World Team Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Penhall retired from speedway after winning his second world title in 1982 and 
Sigalos retired two years later. Ten years later, the two close friends decided 
to revive their competitive instincts and become partners in a 37-foot Scarab 
offshore boat they named Ocean Spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Penhall had done in his first speedway race on his 16th birthday at 
Irwindale Raceway, they won their first time out on the water. It was last June 
8, in a Pacific Offshore Power Boat Assn. race off Dana Point, and in winning 
they defeated world champions Rique Ford and Paul Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, in the Powerboat Magazine Ventura Offshore Challenge, they will try to 
repeat their Dana Point victory. Unlike most offshore races, much of the 
20-mile course will be visible from shore. It will start at 11 a.m. at Ventura 
Harbor. The large boats, such as the Penhall-Sigalos entry, will race six laps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the offshore racing in this country is on the East Coast, but we hope 
to stimulate more interest in West Coast racing," Penhall said while his crew 
put the finishing touches on Ocean Spray at its Huntington Harbour 
headquarters. "It has had its peaks and valleys out here, but it's starting to 
climb up again." 
</P>
<P>
 Their main goal, however, is to win the world offshore championship in a 
two-race series, Nov. 9 and Nov. 13, at Key West, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can win, we will be one of a small number of athletes to win world 
championships in two widely different sports," Penhall said. "That would be 
neat." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first real season in offshore boats for both. Penhall raced part 
time in 1993 with Nigel Hook of England; Sigalos competed briefly on Lake Mead. 
When they compared notes last fall, Penhall said, "Hey, Dennis, we've got to do 
this together. Let's get our own boat." 
</P>
<P>
 With financial help from Dennis' father, Tony, they formed TBD Racing Inc. and 
set out to build a top-of-the-line boat that, Sigalos said, "cost about equal 
to a nice house in Laguna Hills." It costs $7,600 an hour to run it in a race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a rich man's sport, no doubt about it," Sigalos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sigalos family owns an Orange County catering business with a fleet of 200 
trucks and 2,500 vending machines. Penhall's family owned the largest concrete 
demolishing company in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In TBD Racing Inc., Tony Sigalos is the owner, Penhall the pilot and Dennis 
the throttleman. 
</P>
<P>
 The two families have been virtually inseparable since the boys were 7 or 8 
years old and their fathers raced flat-bottom SK runabouts against one another. 
</P>
<P>
 On New Year's Day, 1975, Penhall's mother and father and Sigalos' mother were 
killed in a plane crash while returning from a skiing trip at Mammoth Mountain. 
Tony Sigalos was in another plane. Bruce was supposed to have been on the trip, 
but begged off to practice for the Newport Harbor High baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Spray's main competition Sunday is expected to come from Ragamuffin, a 
32-foot Skater, owned by Ford, a Jamaican who lives in Norco. Ford was run over 
by his 4 1/2-ton trailer on Oct. 2 when thieves attempted to steal his boat 
while he was hooking up the trailer. Ford clung to the bottom of the trailer as 
long as he could, but when he let go, the trailer nearly severed his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, given only a 20% chance to live at the time, is now undergoing 
rehabilitation at Riverside General Hospital and is expected to recover. Craig 
Archer, a former racing partner of world champion Betty Cook, will take Ford's 
place in the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 PAGE JONES -- Doctors and family members have been encouraged by signs of 
movement, but the 22-year-old son of 1963 Indianapolis 500 winner Parnelli 
Jones was still unconscious Wednesday from an accident 18 days ago at Eldora 
Speedway. He is in stable condition and has been sitting up in the intensive 
care unit of Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 MOTORCYCLES -- The see-saw battle between Harley-Davidson teammates Chris Carr 
and Scott Parker for the American Motorcyclist Assn. dirt track championship 
will end Sunday with the Del Mar Mile on the Del Mar Fairgrounds track. Carr, 
of Valley Springs, Calif., can win his second title by finishing second, even 
if Parker, a four-time champion from Swartz Creek, Mich., is the winner. Parker 
had a five-point lead going into last week's race at Pomona, but when his 
engine blew up on the eighth lap and Carr finished third, the lead went back to 
Carr. The program will also spotlight a Lap of Legends, in which former 
champions Joe Leonard, Brad Andres, Floyd and Don Emde, Ralph White, Dick Mann, 
Ed Kretz and Jack Milne will ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lake Elsinore-based Team Suzuki Endurance, founded in 1980 by Bruce Hammer 
and John Ulrich, won its 100th main event and its 10th WERA endurance series 
championship last Saturday at Texas World Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- The 19th annual October Classic this weekend in Bakersfield will 
offer stock car fans at Mesa Marin Raceway a little bit of everything. The 
racing feast starts Friday night with NASCAR Winston West qualifying and the 
Texaco Havoline 100 for late model stock cars. Saturday night will feature the 
U.S. Auto Club's True Value Hardware Silver Crown 100 and the NASCAR 
Featherlite Southwest Tour's Spears Manufacturing 200. On Sunday afternoon, 
Winston West cars will run in the Spears Manufacturing 300. Winston Cup drivers 
Ken Schrader and Rick Carelli will compete against West Coast regulars Mike 
Chase, Gary Collins and Ron Hornaday Jr. The Sunday race can be seen on Prime 
Network at 6 p.m. . . . Orange Show Speedway will close its season Saturday 
night with points races for all five divisions. . . . Blythe Speedway will hold 
its final points race for sportsman and hobby stocks Saturday night. . . . 
Legend cars and street stocks will race Saturday night at Kern County Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 SPRINT CARS -- The Sprint Car Racing Assn. will hold a new race, Thunder by 
the River, at a new site, Mojave Valley Speedway in Bullhead City, Ariz., on 
Saturday night. The track is a one-third mile dirt oval, with Bill Dyer, Danny 
Pivovaroff and former sprint car champions Dean Thompson and Bubby Jones as 
promoters. Ron Shuman, who took over the SCRA lead with a victory in the 
Pacific Coast Open last Friday night at Hanford, will be after his 10th victory 
in the inaugural SCRA season. Shuman leads Rip Williams, 1,243-1,237, with 
three races remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 LAND SPEED -- Standing water on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah has caused 
the Southern California Timing Assn. to cancel the combined Bonneville Speed 
Weeks and World Finals, which were scheduled to run through Tuesday. The SCTA 
season will close with a two-day meet Nov. 12-13 at the El Mirage Dry Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 OFF ROAD -- Rod Millen led teammate Ivan Stewart across the finish line last 
Saturday in Denver to clinch a third consecutive Grand National truck drivers 
championship in the Mickey Thompson Stadium Series and the manufacturers cup 
for Team Toyota. Mercedes Gonzales became the first woman driver to win a main 
event in the Thompson series when she beat series champion Greg George in the 
SuperLite final. . . . The California 200, a La Rana desert race, will be held 
Saturday with a 9 a.m. start at the Teagle Wash, off Trona Road, near 
Ridgecrest. 
</P>
<P>
 MIDGETS -- Ventura Raceway will present four classes of open-wheeled racing 
Saturday night. Featured will be USAC three-quarter midgets, California Dwarf 
cars, micro midgets and winged mini sprints.

ACADEMICALLY TROUBLED FRESHMEN MAY GET BREAK FROM THE NCAA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NCAA Council on Wednesday endorsed a proposal by the President's 
Commission to relax restrictions on partial qualifiers -- incoming freshman who 
do not meet all of the academic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, the main bureaucratic arm of the NCAA, gave its blessing to the 
proposal for all freshman who do not meet the minimum scores on standardized 
tests to still receive scholarship aid and practice with their teams. 
</P>
<P>
 They would not, however, be able to play in games. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal will be voted on by Division I-A schools during the NCAA 
convention in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, partial qualifiers can be admitted to school but must pay their own 
way and cannot practice or play their freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is in response to the complaints of many coaches, particularly 
members of the Black Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the council stopped short of making a decision on awarding a fourth 
year of eligibility to partial qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would define a partial qualifier as a freshman who didn't make a 
combined 700 on the SAT or a 17 on the ACT, but achieved a 2.5 grade-point in a 
core curriculum of 13 courses in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, incoming athletes must meet both the standardized test score and 
the grade-point requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also reversed itself and withdrew its support for a sliding scale 
in which a lower test score could be compensated for by a higher grade-point.

MOLDOVA MOVES UP TO BIG TIME; SOCCER: UPSET OF WALES HIGHLIGHTS QUALIFYING FOR 
EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP.

 Defending champion Denmark scored a convincing 3-1 victory over its toughest 
rival, Belgium, on Wednesday night, and Switzerland was equally impressive in 
defeating Sweden, 4-2, but it was unheralded Moldova that captured the big 
headlines in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 On a night when 34 nations were involved in qualifying play for the 1996 
European Championship, Moldova scored a 3-2 upset over Wales at Chisinau. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss dealt a blow to Wales' hopes of finishing at least second in Group 7 
behind favored Germany and boosted the fortunes of Bulgaria, which beat 
Georgia, 2-0, with both goals coming from Emil Kostadinov off passes from 
balding World Cup hero Yordan Letchkov. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Welsh played without injured stars Ian Rush, Ryan Giggs, Mark 
Hughes and Dean Saunders, they appeared en route to a 2-2 tie, but Valery 
Pogorelov scored the winner for Moldova in the 79th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no upsets in the three major encounters of the night. At 
Copenhagen, the Danes fell behind, 1-0, when Marc DeGryse scored for Belgium, 
but goals by 1992 European Championship stars Kim Vilfort and John Jensen 
erased that advantage. Mark Strudhal scored Denmark's third goal late in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 At Oslo, the Netherlands and Norway played to a 1-1 tie. The Norwegians 
yielded a first-half goal to Dutch winger Bryan Roy but regrouped to salvage a 
tie on Kjetil Rekdal's shot in the 52nd minute. 
</P>

 Sweden, which finished a strong third in World Cup '94, was taken apart by the 
Swiss at Berne. It was Switzerland's third consecutive victory over the Swedes. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was barely five minutes old when Kennet Andersson put Sweden ahead, 
and the Swiss had to wait half an hour before getting back on level terms on 
Christophe Ohrel's goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes regained the lead in the 61st minute when Martin Dahlin found the 
net, only to give it up again minutes later on an own goal by Jesper Blomqvist. 
Ciri Sforza scored the game-winner in the 81st minute and Kubilay Turkyilmaz 
scored Switzerland's fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 There was good news for both Irish teams. Northern Ireland traveled to Vienna, 
where it beat Austria, 2-1, behind goals by Keith Gillespie and Phil Gray. Jack 
Charlton's Ireland stayed home and defeated Liechtenstein, 4-0, in Dublin, on 
two goals apiece from Tommy Coyne and Niall Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece, on the rebound after a disastrous World Cup campaign, scored another 
impressive victory under new Coach Costas Polyhroniou. Wednesday's 4-0 drubbing 
of Finland at Salonika followed a 5-1 victory over the Faroe Islands in 
September and left the Greeks in first place in Group 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a new team formed after the World Cup," Polyhroniou said. "They play 
fast and simple, and this is the secret to success." 
</P>
<P>
 Scotland kept pace by trouncing the Faroes, 5-1, at Glasgow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scots were ahead, 3-0, at the half, thanks to goals from John McGinlay, 
Scott Booth and John Collins. Billy McGinlay made it 4-0 in the 61st minute and 
Collins got his second goal 11 minutes later. Jan Muller scored a consolation 
goal for Faroe Islands 15 minutes from the end. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tel Aviv, Israel gave up two goals in the first 16 minutes to Slovakia, 
then fought back to earn a 2-2 tie on goals by Ronen Harazi and Tal Banin. 
</P>
<P>
 There were fireworks at Valletta, where tiny Malta stole a point off the Czech 
Republic, the team that had beaten it, 6-1, at Ostrava last month. This time, 
the Maltese defense held firm and, even though Czech striker Jan Suchoparek hit 
the post with a penalty kick, Malta deserved a scoreless tie. 
</P>
<P>
 In other results, Poland defeated Azerbaijan, 1-0, with a goal by 1992 Olympic 
silver medalist Andrzej Juskowiak; Turkey trounced Iceland, 5-0; Ukraine and 
Slovenia played to a scoreless tie; Belarus beat Luxembourg, 2-0; Russia 
crushed San Marino, 4-0; and Spain moved to the top of Group 2 by defeating 
Macedonia, 2-0, at Skopje, with both goals coming from Julio Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-seven nations are involved in qualifying play that continues through 
November 1995. Fifteen teams will join host England in the finals in June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 In two friendly games Wednesday, Germany was held to a 0-0 tie by Hungary at 
Budapest, and Romania earned a 1-1 tie with England at Wembley.

 Sergi Bruguera and Boris Becker dropped their matches to low-ranked players 
Wednesday at the Seiko Super tournament at Tokyo, but Jeff Tarango of Manhattan 
Beach went one better. He dropped his pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruguera, seeded second, squandered a 5-1 lead in the final set and was upset 
by 145th-ranked Tommy Ho, 6-7 (7-4), 6-2, 7-6 (7-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, seeded fifth, lost to 110th-ranked Brett Steven of New Zealand, 6-3, 
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 But most fans went home talking about Tarango dropping his pants after losing 
the eighth game of the second set to Michael Chang and waddling off the court 
with his shorts around his ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that I let the match slip away a little bit, and I wanted to make 
light of it," said Tarango, who retired from the match during the third set 
because of an arm injury. "I had exposed my weakness to Michael." 
</P>
<P>
 He later apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour supervisor Gayle Bradshaw said he would consider the matter overnight, 
then assess a fine within the range the tour allows, from $750 to $10,000.

OAK TREE; VALENZUELA IN LIMBO AFTER NO-SHOW

 Pat Valenzuela, who hasn't ridden since last Thursday, was a no-show for a 
meeting with the Oak Tree stewards Wednesday morning, and his whereabouts 
remain unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, who has a history of substance abuse, won't be able to ride again 
until he meets with Oak Tree stewards Tom Ward, Pete Pedersen and Ingrid 
Fermin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to look for him," said Ward, who said the rider also hadn't 
called with an excuse. "He knows where we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to ride a couple of horses at Belmont Park last Saturday on the 
Breeders' Cup Preview card, Valenzuela, who will turn 32 Monday, called the 
stewards from a hotel in nearby Garden City, N.Y., to say that he couldn't ride 
because of food poisoning. He had not ridden the day before because of a 
reported dental problem.

 The lone ticket that won the National Best Seven was purchased by an 
unidentified bettor at Thistledown in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the wager began on May 30, there was only one winning 
ticket and it was worth $453,937.95, thanks primarily to the jackpot pool that 
had grown to more than $318,000. Seven percent of the Best Seven pool each week 
is put into the jackpot pool and the jackpot is paid only when there is one 
correct ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 If One Mean Man, who finished second in the Sport Of Kings Futurity at 
Louisiana Downs, had beaten Mr. Vicious, there would have been no tickets with 
seven winners Saturday.

 Leonard Lavin, the man behind Glen Hill Farm, might have a contender for the 
Strub series and the La Canada series this winter at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Rung, a 3-year-old filly, and Team Leader, a 3-year-old gelding, were both 
impressive in victory during the opening week of the Oak Tree meeting and look 
to have promising futures. Both are trained by Willard Proctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Second in her first two starts, Top Rung, a daughter of Seattle Slew out of 
the Glen Hill Farm-owned mare Feature Price, broke her maiden Sept. 10 at Del 
Mar, then beat two other promising 3-year-old fillies, Mock Orange and Locate, 
by six and 9 1/2 lengths, respectively, in a one-mile allowance race last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden for the first time by Eddie Delahoussaye, Top Rung covered the distance 
in 1:35 1/5 in her first try around two turns. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, Team Leader turned in a courageous performance when he earned 
the second victory of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gary Stevens aboard, the son of Private Account was blocked most of the 
stretch, then was forced to steady sharply to apparently lose all chance, but 
gathered himself along a narrow opening on the rail and got up to beat 
Myceenote by a head in 1:43 1/5 for the 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Proctor said early this year that this is going to be a Strub horse and 
he's not wrong too often," Stevens said. "I think he proved how much courage he 
does have and how much ability. I mean, to get stopped 50 yards like he did and 
then burrow his way through a tight hole, get bumped again and still get up and 
get the job done, well, he's a very nice colt."

 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Cardmania, the 1993 Breeders' Cup Sprint winner, is among those expected to be 
entered this morning for Saturday's $100,000 Ancient Title at six furlongs. 
Injured in February while preparing for the San Antonio, the 8-year-old gelding 
is expected to meet Ojai, King's Blade, Sir Hutch, Uncaged Fury, Concept Win 
and Saratoga Gambler. . . . The other stake on the card is the $200,000 
Goodwood, which is expected to lure Dramatic Gold, Stuka, Del Mar Dennis, 
Lykatill Hil, Bertrando and, possibly, Fastness. . . . Gary Stevens won three 
consecutive races Wednesday, scoring with River Flyer, Soltero and Canfield's 
Girl.

THE SPRING COLLECTIONS / PARIS; TRES SLEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL / TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a scene from the horror classic "Night of the Living Dead," clusters of 
somber, pale-skinned wraiths, their eyes ablaze, latch onto people arriving at 
this week's spring '95 fashion shows. "Please, mad ame," pleads one of the 
young groupies, "do you have an extra ticket?" 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the journalists and buyers here do. Invitations to one of the 75-plus 
shows, which started Monday and continue through next Tuesday, are 
painstakingly allocated and slipped mysteriously under hotel room doors each 
day -- to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, ticket-hungry hipsters managed to crash Monday's Dries Van Noten show 
at the Hotel George V and Tuesday evening's presentation of the Ann 
Demeulemeester collection at the Ecole de Beaux Arts. All for the chance to see 
slightly demented, impeccably tailored clothes that graze the knee and look so 
ladylike that models must rue the day they got tattoos. (Nose and navel rings 
have vanished.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Highly groomed" is how Karl Lagerfeld describes the trend. "Femininity, 
glamour, never really went anywhere," he said, fanning himself backstage at Le 
Carrousel du Louvre after the unveiling of his pretty-girl collection for 
Chloe. "It just changes its form. It evolves." 
</P>
<P>
 So, deconstructionist Demeulemeester does a speed-metal version of Jil Sander. 
Junko Shimada reinvents the sun dress, with a '60s spin to mercifully stamp out 
last year's granny gown. Van Noten sends out his version of Audrey Hepburn, 
Doris Day and Joan Crawford in muted pastels. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as always, the audience wears black. 
</P>
<P>
 In a setting where your daily paper -- the International Herald Tribune -- 
comes "Compliments from Giorgio Armani" and speculation over whether Madonna 
will model at the Jean Paul Gaultier show on Friday dominates conversation, 
some things never change. And when change does happen, at least on the runway, 
it is immediately digested by journalists with laptop computers and tiny video 
playback monitors and served up as trends, such as: Most Criminal Styles 
Perpetrated on Models by Designers: Neck corsets, courtesy of Rifat Ozbek; 
toplessness for toplessness' sake at Ann Demeulemeester (is there such a thing 
as collective embarrassment?); the transformation of the now-red-haired Kristen 
McMenamy from Angular Enigma to a high-fashion version of Nurse Ratched in 
Claude Montana's white shirtwaist dress, white stockings, white Famolare-style 
platforms. Colonic irrigation, anyone? Soundtrack Selections: The fashion 
world's current fascination with disco has apparently stopped at the Italian 
border. Instead, designers such as Karl Lagerfeld envision their customers 
bouncing along to Archie Bell & the Drells' "Tighten Up." ("We not only sing, 
but we dance just as good as we walk.") Claude Montana choreographed his 
glamorous show at a theater-in-the-round near the Bastille to "The Marriage of 
Figaro," prompting photographers to warble "Figaro, Figaro, Fi-ga-ro!" at the 
top of their lungs. Moment in the Sun: Nadja Auermann has been burning a hole 
in the runway with her intensity, not to mention her stiletto heels -- from 
which her little toe keeps popping out. "Nadja! Nadja!" the photographers yell. 
She amiably returned their attention with one supervixen pose after another. 
Bridget Hall's chest-thrusting walk and pouty mouth have been greeted with 
appreciative groans and wolf whistles, reminders that the photographers are 
mostly straight and that the best clothes (wearable, discreet, untheatrical) go 
unphotographed. Most Thought-Provoking Accessories: Bracelets-cum-flotation 
devices at Claude Montana; licorice-whip ties hanging from nearly every piece 
in the Rifat Ozbek collection; a navy-and-white polka-dot scarp that obscured 
the head of a model at Dior. Freshest Clothes: Junko Shimada, a name unfamiliar 
to most Americans, showed a line of alternately spare and witty dresses that 
come the closest so far to what women in Los Angeles like to wear when it's 
hot. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Really: Except in the collections of such fashion purists as Yohji 
Yamamoto and Ann Demeulemeester, shoulder pads are creeping back into jackets, 
blouses, dresses and jump suits. Rifat Ozbek made them obvious, in neon orange 
or covered with sequins. Did they ever disappear from Claude Montana's line? 
Anyway, the padding seems to balance the longer skirts, and it either looks 
very '80s a la Montana or very '40s. Of course, some women never gave them up. 
Celebrity Sightings: Last season, the Paris shows were packed with celebrities, 
thanks to the filming of Robert Altman's forthcoming fashion satire, 
"Pret-a-Porter." But so far, the only star to stop by has been Sophia Loren, 
front-row center at Gianfranco Ferre's line for Christian Dior. This season, 
the designers and their clothes have to generate their own star power and 
there's a distinct sense among fashion veterans here that Altman would be 
welcome back -- soon.

THE SPRING COLLECTIONS / CALIFORNIA; ROMANTIC INTERLUDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON / TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Billowing fog, nymphettes strewing rose petals and men wearing only silk 
pajama pants were just some of the props in Bonnie Strauss' theatrical ode to 
beauty and seduction last weekend at the California Collections fashion shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles designer's dresses were fit for a Harlequin Romance cover. 
Corselets, bustiers, aprons, long full skirts and peasant-style blouses evoked 
maidens ripe for abduction. And in a Cinderella fantasy sequence, the "before" 
frock consisted of layers of organdy rags and the "after" ball gown looked like 
something for the woman who has never gotten the fairy-princess look out of her 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Strauss wasn't the only designer who played with fantasy themes. At one point 
last month, the event itself appeared to be the stuff of dreams. But the 
financially troubled California Mart's new owner, Equitable Life Assurance 
Society of the United States, didn't squelch the two days of tent shows and 
awards gala that had been in the making for nine months. After a four-year 
hiatus, the fashion fest featuring mostly Southern California designers 
returned to the streets of Downtown Los Angeles. And Maurice (Corky) Newman, 
the Mart's president, has promised to make it a twice-yearly event. 
</P>
<P>
 Even better news was delivered on the runways. The best spring and summer 
collections for '95 were exquisite; the worst were at least interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, Pamela Barish, Jessica McClintock and Strauss all heard the call of 
the new femininity and responded with designs that nipped at the waists and 
rounded the curves. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie Barry and Ty Moore, the Van Buren team known for Lycra club clothes, 
showed they can also do daytime dresses and swimwear. They mixed Peter 
Pan-collar, floral-print shirtwaist dresses with patent leather corselets. 
Bustiers done in a happy daisy print and laced down the sides topped narrow 
skirts decorously hemmed just above the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren showed its swimwear, as many designers did, with sportswear, 
combining brightly colored bikini bottoms with T-shirts. Other entries included 
Anne Klein's resort duo of pink gingham shorts and bikini top, Sirena's 
mechanic-shop calendar-girl combo of patent leather jacket and bikini bottom, 
and Mossimo's SoCal semiformal look of long black mesh dress over black bikini. 
</P>
<P>
 Barish, a California Mart Rising Star nominee, showed a collection rivaling 
those seen on the avant-garde Paris runways. Ankle-length dresses of rough 
douppioni or slippery smooth silk charmeuse were cut away or unbuttoned to 
reveal metallic organza pants and slips. Knee-length jackets were sliced open 
to also reveal translucent under-layers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barish was also in on the Capri deal. Above-the-ankle, tight-fitting, tailored 
trousers and cropped sleeveless tops showed up all over. Fortunately, 
loose-fitting, drawstring-waist pants were also easy to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Many designers stuck with the very casual, boxy, touch-me-not, clothes of 
seasons past. David Dart, who won the California Designer of the Year award, 
and Johnathon Hoenscheidt, who captured the Rising Star award, showed such 
collections, which play well in mainstream department stores. But the audience 
seemed more enamored of the designs by McClintock and Strauss, two perennial 
romantics who made a big leap from pretty clothes to poetic creations. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock offered modern evening gowns that traded on the past. She topped 
heavy white satin bustiers with single-layer douppioni overskirts cut short in 
the front, long in the back. They wafted around the models' legs like 
lightweight clouds. Some skirts had bustles, others added ruffled edges and 
still others had long trains, yet each held its shape without petticoats. 
</P>
<P>
 Strauss' steamy production and McClintock's graceful one drove home the allure 
of the turn toward feminine dressing, especially such pieces as bustiers, 
corselets and full skirts. Baby-doll dresses in the Natalie "D" collection -- 
with smocking, puffed sleeves and in pristine white, as favored by rock singer 
Courtney Love -- were in that hyper-estrogen group too. 
</P>
<P>
 These fantasy clothes meld old-fashion values -- Donna Reed-inspired clothes, 
kimonos and first-communion dresses -- with dominatrix themes of bustiers, hot 
pants and stiletto heels. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments of brilliance during the shows also included Elizabetta Rogiani's 
one-sleeved sweaters with a separate arm piece resembling an opera-length 
glove; A.K.A.'s nubby ivory fabrics, linen or terry cloth, mixed with slick 
silver Lurex and satin; Poleci's white skirts and shorts with cropped jackets 
made of soccer jersey fabric and edged in patent leather; Joy Perreras for 
Rialto's big white linen shirts with fagoting, and Tina Hagan's silver-on-ivory 
sari fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who track fashion stats, it's orange and silver as the predominant 
colors, stiletto heels as the dominant shoe, and cleavage -- store-bought, 
home-grown or implanted -- as the preferred accessory.

THEY TOLD THE SECRETS OF AMERICA'S BEDROOMS; LIFESTYLES: THEY COULDN'T GET 
FEDERAL FUNDING, BUT WITH THE PUBLICATION OF THEIR STUDY, THESE THREE 
RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN SEX IS A NATIONAL ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 How do you persuade the U.S. government to fund a huge study about sex? 
</P>
<P>
 Easy, thought Edward O. Laumann, Robert T. Michael and John H. Gagnon -- 
senior scholars in their respective fields of social organization, economics 
and social psychology. You couch your request for government funds behind an 
innocuous heading -- perhaps a neat little term of art like "Social and 
Behavioral Aspects of Health and Fertility-Related Behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 "I still chortle over that one," said Laumann, who holds the imposing title of 
George Herbert Mead Distinguished Service Professor of Sociology at the 
University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 But certain segments of official Washington were less amused. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got noticed," said Gagnon, a professor of sociology and psychology at the 
State University of New York at Stony Brook. Sex is generally good for a 
political hurricane, and the prospect of a comprehensive survey of this most 
private of pastimes proved to be no exception. All of a sudden, the three 
mild-mannered academics began hearing rumors that they were working on a 
pornographic questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, it all boiled over on the floor of Senate, whose members were 
debating funding for the project. Gagnon heard Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) rail 
"that my elevator didn't go all the way to the top." Gagnon, 62, decided not to 
be offended; he considered the remark "an honorific." 
</P>
<P>
 With the publication last week of "Sex in America" (Little, Brown and Co.; New 
York Times science writer Gina Kolata is listed as a co-author), the three 
researchers have found themselves back in the fray. Headlines are touting their 
finding that most Americans lead very tame sex lives, and radio talk show hosts 
are wondering what rocks the researchers had to crawl under to find married 
people who say they have better sex -- and more often -- than their unmarried 
friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 A denser, more academic version of the trio's conclusions, titled "The Social 
Organizations of Sexuality," will be published next week by the University of 
Chicago Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuffed in their search for federal funds, Laumann, Michael and Gagnon 
financed their "National Sex Survey of Adults," which forms the basis for both 
books, through grants from eight private foundations. The three social 
scientists devised a questionnaire and deployed a small army of professional 
pollsters to conduct in-person interviews with 3,423 demographically diverse 
Americans, ages 18 to 59. The 1992 study was conducted under the aegis of the 
University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In telephone interviews, Laumann, Michael and Gagnon explained that they 
proposed a vast, scientifically accurate survey of sexual practices in this 
country in 1987, in an attempt to demystify the AIDS epidemic. To understand 
the disease as it began exploding into the culture, they reasoned, scientists 
needed a kind of sexual behavior base line -- a broad sample that simply looked 
at habits and practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an awful lot of policy and decision-making based around these private 
activities," said Michael, a 52-year-old economist with "expertise and a keen 
interest" in family choice issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a field laced with prurience and tinged with ambivalence, he said, "It 
seems we are supposed to make these decisions in total ignorance. There just 
aren't any other topics that I can think of where we care so much, get 
bombarded so heavily -- and know so little." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the most conservative factions of Washington, Michael said, would not 
place a knowledge ban on any other issue. "Sewer systems we (can) know about. 
But not sex." 
</P>
<P>
 Many assumptions about the intimate lives of ordinary Americans were based on 
outmoded and unscientific studies, the trio said. Pioneer sex researcher Alfred 
Kinsey, Laumann said, based his findings from the 1940s on non-random, largely 
self-selected samples, "whoever he happened to talk to and could recruit." 
William Masters and Virginia Johnson undertook clinical studies that also 
failed to examine a general population, they said. And Laumann, for one, 
dismissed the best-selling "reports" of author Shere Hite as "junk statistics." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, their own research was reviewed by "a pile of graduate students," 
including "nuns and ordained priests," said Laumann, 56. The material was 
examined dispassionately, they insisted, with neither an agenda nor a set of 
preconceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 What was most important about their findings, Gagnon said, was "not any 
individual numbers, but the collective portrait -- a mirror of a society in 
which sexuality turns out to be extraordinarily conventional." 
Chandelier-swinging, partner-switching and other raucous practices may occupy 
an enormous space in America's fantasy life, "but in everyday life, sexuality 
is really a rather modest pleasure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or for worse, Gagnon added, "it's not 'Pretty Woman.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the almost boring quality of their results does not detract from the 
sensitivity of their subject matter. Scholars of lesser stature might have 
shied away from such a public sex study -- hardly a sure-sell in the 
increasingly conservative environment of many universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a way to get tenure," said Michael, who, as the Eliakim Hastings 
Moore Distinguished Service Professor and dean of the Irving B. Harris Graduate 
School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, was unconcerned by such 
matters, 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three researchers, only Gagnon had conducted earlier studies on 
sexuality. He had contributed to three other books about sex, focusing on such 
topics as sex offenses, sexuality in adolescence and the roles of families, 
communities and television in sex education. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite Gagnon's earlier research, the new study gave him pause. "I'm a 
man, and I'm a victim of all that men believe, desire and fantasize about," he 
said. "I think I always knew that sexual life was governed by the same 
processes that all other life was governed by. But like everyone else in the 
culture, I'd like magic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the numbers" -- figures that showed that most American women have 
two sexual partners in life and most U.S. men have six -- "and I thought, 'Can 
it be this low?' " Gagnon said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Michael, the eight-year odyssey of the National Adult Sex Survey was only 
a beginning of research he hopes to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like finding a whole new planet," he said. "We've uncovered a good bit. 
But almost on every topic we found 10 more things we would like to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Laumann said he was hopeful that the study might encourage greater 
cross-disciplinary exploration of issues pertaining to sex and gender. At the 
University of Chicago, he said he has begun leading monthly workshops about sex 
that attract researchers from fields ranging from economics to endocrinology. 
</P>
<P>
 But Laumann said his research team was still reeling from its "Kafka-esque" 
collision with the federal bureaucracy -- including a run-in with something 
called the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1942. Years of studying the inner 
workings of government systems left him unprepared for this firsthand 
encounter, Laumann said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow," he said, "I never dreamed I would be using the information I had 
gathered about official Washington to fend off this (funding) firestorm we 
provoked." 
</P>
<P>
 But at least these three were left with their senses of humor intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, they said, they are planning to send an autographed copy of "Sex in 
America" to Capitol Hill -- to the attention of Sen. Helms.

 In the beauty business, a woman's place is in the kitchen (that being just 
another word for lab). In the first half of this century, the grande dames of 
cosmetics -- Helena Rubinstein, Elizabeth Arden and Estee Lauder -- started out 
behind the stove, cooking up batches of face cream from scratch. The results -- 
Creme Valaze, Venetian Cream and Super Rich All Purpose Creme, respectively -- 
launched cosmetic empires. 
</P>
<P>
 That tradition continues, with a new generation of skin-care chefs concocting 
what they hope will be the ubiquitous creams of tomorrow. Using such 
ingredients from the larder as oats, cucumbers, apple juice and nonfat dry 
milk, these local entrepreneurs have more in common with their famous forebears 
than do such cosmetics upstarts as Donna Karan, who introduced a skin-care line 
this year with the help of a dermatologist -- and a reported $4-million 
advertising budget. The only form of promotion these Los Angeles women can 
afford is word of mouth. Here are three who are making people talk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the Eastern European connection. Helena Rubinstein, who was born in 
Poland, admitted to a biographer that "lots of Romanians and Hungarians -- 
clever with skin -- taught me masses." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Romania, Mariana Chicet studied cosmetic chemistry and skin care 
for two years at a Bucharest college, then immigrated to Los Angeles in 1979 at 
age 27. Tucked among her belongings was a 100-year-old formula for what would 
become Bone Marrow Cream, an "anti-wrinkle" emollient that is now her 
bestseller. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicet started her career here by giving facials and invested those earnings 
into electric mixers, she says. "One gallon, then five gallon, then 10." Her 
signature product line was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the bottles line the window of her small eponymous store on West 3rd 
Street in Los Angeles, where three full-time aestheticians perform 85 facials a 
week. Chicet is too busy doing skin consultations and visiting her lab near Cal 
State L.A. to do much hands-on work these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicet is candid about her "secret" ingredients. A local meat packer supplies 
the beef bones ("they have to be fresh") from which workers extract the oil for 
Bone Marrow Cream. The seaweed in her Fresh Sea Plant Mask is imported from 
Japan and crushed gently in a special mixer. Moisturizers such as collagen, 
elastin and hyaluronic acid come from a Swiss pharmaceuticals firm. Prices 
range from $7.50 for Emollient Cleanser to $25.50 for Day and Night 
Revitalizing Concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Every couple of months, Chicet and her husband, who oversees the lab, order 
small production runs -- 350 jars of Bone Marrow Cream, 600 bottles of Nutrient 
Milk Cleanser -- to fill demand. Although they could expand the business 
through outside investors and boost their $200,000 in annual sales, "investors 
cut corners," Chicet says. "They would say, 'Why do you use so much collagen, 
33%, in your Day and Night Concentrate?' " 
</P>
<P>
 So she does it her way. With a celebrity clientele that includes Linda 
Evangelista, Kyle MacLachlan, Laura Dern, Diane Ladd, Nicole Kidman, Judy 
Davis, Stephanie Zimbalist and Lara Flynn Boyle, she must be doing something 
right.

<P>
 Just as Estee Lauder's Hungarian uncle provided her with the original formula 
for Super Rich All Purpose Creme, Arcona Devan's Scandinavian grandmother 
handed down the recipes that would form the backbone of her company. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in what was East Germany, Arcona, who goes by her first name only, 
studied premed and worked as a medical technician in Munich before moving to 
Los Angeles 20 years ago. She found a job at a hospital in the Valley but had 
less success finding the right night cream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had the most problematic skin," she says, "because it's 
sensitive, thin and oily -- the most difficult skin to treat. Especially in 
Southern California, with the smog and the heat. Then I remembered my 
grandmother. Once a week she'd make a very powerful sugar solution and put it 
on her face. Sometimes she'd use white wine. Of course, both are natural acids. 
She had the most beautiful skin." 
</P>
<P>
 Grandma also left a legacy of cornmeal scrubs, yogurt packs, egg yolk (or egg 
white) facials and vinegar- or lemon-juice-based toners. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcona began giving "holistic" facials out of her house in 1986 using her 
homemade products, then hooked up with a chemist who added "scientific 
substances" to the formulas. The Arcona Skin and Beauty Therapy line was 
launched in 1989 and is produced today in a local lab, with names that evoke an 
earlier era: Golden Grain Gommage (an exfoliator containing lemon peel, oats 
and cornmeal), Toner Tea Bar (green tea extract), Desert Mist (with mucin) and 
Magic Green Ice (the mystery ingredient is shark cartilage). Prices range from 
$25 for Glissando Body Lotion to $45 for the Solution, featuring glycolic acid. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked into an anonymous, ivy-covered commercial building in North Hollywood, 
the Arcona Studio is kept humming from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day except 
Sunday. Since Arcona trained three full-time facialists in her technique -- the 
Non-Surgical Face Lift and Facial Contouring with Essential Oils -- she's been 
trying to cut back her hours in the treatment room. New clients who insist on 
her magic fingers face a long waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she says the business is "only a boutique operation," Arcona and her 
husband/partner sold $250,000 in products and treatments last year. Many 
clients come from the nearby studios (Universal, Disney, Warner Bros., NBC). 
Forget about prying their names out of Arcona. "They trust me not to tell," she 
says, admitting that a few are accompanied by bodyguards, who wait in her tiny 
reception area. 
</P>
<P>
 The only big name Arcona can drop is actress Linda Gray of "Models Inc.," 
because "Linda is my friend," Arcona says. "She has been coming to me, once a 
week, for 4 1/2 years -- unless she's away on location. She's committed to the 
facials, and that's why they work for her."

 Beauty mavens move to where the market is. Helena Rubinstein launched her 
cream by applying it to the sun-scorched, wind-burned faces of Australian 
women. And Lisha Coleman arrived in 1988 to help save us from the California 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
 She came bearing gifts from Baltimore, where she created Feed Your Face 
Cosmetics -- a line of homemade, refrigerated skin-care products distributed 
through health-food stores. Although Coleman had trained under skin-care 
aesthetician Von Lee and holistic healer Marcia Brown, she calls her mom -- 
Ella Maria Otaigbe, a licensed cosmetologist -- her mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother worked in Nigeria for eight years," Coleman explains, "setting up 
and supervising a manufacturing plant for hair products."  
</P>
<P>
 The botanicals she brought back -- African shea butter, sage rosemary and hemp 
-- inspired Coleman's skin-care line. At the same time, she began doing hair 
and makeup for celebrities such as Ben Vereen and Philip Michael Thomas on the 
set of "Miami Vice." Armed with contacts and expertise, Coleman moved to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the 34-year-old lives in the Hollywood Hills, where a back-yard guest 
house serves as a test kitchen for Lisha Coleman's Collection, an improved 
version of the Feed Your Face line. "I'm self-made," she says. "You can call me 
a chemist or a witch doctor, either one, but I'm most at home in a lab." 
</P>
<P>
 She employs a cosmetic chemist with whom "I fistfight constantly because I'm 
such a stickler for natural ingredients," Coleman says. "My chemist wants to 
save money by using synthetics." The products are mass-produced at a Huntington 
Beach lab, using natural ingredients from suppliers in Africa, Switzerland and 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 She calls her company modest and estimates sales at $30,000 a month. That's a 
lot of Cucumber Facial Bath, Collagen Creme Concentrate, Honey and Almond Oil 
Scrub, 911 Gel/Emergency Oil Control (for blemishes), and Orange and Sesame 
Moisture Lotion (her bestseller). Prices range from $10 for Aloe Vera Wash to 
$22 for Moisturizing Collagen Masque. Like colleagues Chicet and Arcona, 
Coleman conducts skin-care consultations by phone and ships the prescribed 
products nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 To administer facials and hair extensions, another Coleman specialty, she 
makes house calls or rents space at local salons. Among her rich and famous 
clients: Shari Belafonte plus three soap opera stars and four models who shall 
go nameless because "they would scratch my eyes out if I told you," Coleman 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her male customers, on the other hand, aren't secretive. Eddie Murphy, Al 
Jarreau, Stevie Wonder and Larry Holmes have all ordered products. "Men are 
some of by best clients," Coleman says. "If I tell them to use the cleanser, 
toner moisturizer and scrub twice a day, they follow my instructions to the 
letter. They will not mix and match brands." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike her fellow skin-care chefs, Coleman is on the lookout for investors. 
Just remember, she's the boss.

PAYING RESPECTS TO AN AMERICAN LEGEND -- FINALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN JAQUES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1903, after much dickering, Jack London received a flat fee of $2,000 for 
his second novel. The publisher did not believe that the story of a dog's 
struggle for survival in the Alaskan Klondike would do well with the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a century later, "The Call of the Wild" is still doing well -- in more 
than 80 languages. 
</P>
<P>
 During his lifetime, London's stories and novels sold so well that he became 
the first American writer to earn more than a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all of his popularity and commercial success, London never gained 
respect in literary and academic circles. And even though his writings span a 
wide range of subjects and locales -- from the lepers of Molokai to the 
homeless of London's East End -- critics have pigeonholed London as a writer of 
juvenile dog stories. 
</P>
<P>
 That image is starting to change. A small but dedicated group of scholars is 
renewing interest in London, revealing a complex personality who figures 
importantly in American literature and California history. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hollywood is taking notice again. Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner are working 
on a film biography about London, and a movie version of London's 
autobiographical novel "Martin Eden" is also in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, about 100 members of the Jack London Society made a pilgrimage to 
the Huntington Library in San Marino, a mecca for London scholarship. The 
library houses the largest collection of London material, including 
manuscripts, correspondence and about 10,000 photographs. And within the musty 
leaves of London's scrapbooks, volumes of clippings reveal that the native 
Californian made front-page news as a war correspondent, world traveler and 
adventurer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most popular writer of the day was conspicuously absent from the 
reviews of the era's most important literary critic, William Dean Howells. 
</P>
<P>
 "London was poor and illegitimate, without much formal education," explained 
symposium organizer Jeanne Campbell Reesman of the University of Texas at San 
Antonio. "He was from the West Coast instead of from Boston. He was a 
socialist. All those things didn't sit well with the Atlantic Monthly critics." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't only his background. London upset the academic Establishment by 
challenging assumptions about gender and race. Today, this deep sense of social 
justice adds to his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't many American male fiction writers who treat women as 
sympathetically or compassionately as London," said Clarice Stasz of Sonoma 
State University, author of "American Dreamers: Charmian and Jack London" (St. 
Martin's Press, 1988). 
</P>
<P>
 Stasz believes that the macho persona London helped perpetuate in the press 
was a facade to sell books. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would be on all the talk shows today," she said. "But few people know that 
London loved to hear his wife play Chopin and read aloud Romantic poetry to 
friends. And he was incredibly generous. The money was going out just as fast 
as he made it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor behind the growing interest in London is the range of his work. 
Over his 20-year career, London kept to a dizzying writing schedule of 1,000 
words a day. The result is a body of 200 stories, 20 novels and 400 works of 
nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it was one work in particular, "Martin Eden," that hooked a young reader, 
Earle Labor, about 40 years ago in Navy boot camp. Since then, Labor -- now 
Wilson Professor of American Literature at Centenary College of Louisiana -- 
has been studying, teaching and preaching the London gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Louisiana State University English professor Robert C. Leitz III 
and London's great-nephew I. Milo Shepard, Labor edited more than 1,500 of 
London's letters to family, friends and publishers. Publication of the 
correspondence in 1988 by the Stanford University Press is seen as a watershed 
event, opening the field to serious scholarly attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters represent the most authentic portrait of London that will ever be 
presented, Leitz said, because the author is telling his own story. Last year, 
the three collaborated on "The Complete Short Stories of Jack London." 
</P>
<P>
 Literary executor Shepard, whose grandmother Eliza London Shepard was London's 
stepsister, was the one who decided to finally open up London's life to 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "London gave away the holographs or tore up his manuscripts, but when Charmian 
came along, she kept every scrap of paper," Shepard explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with greater access to London, scholars are filling in the missing pieces 
and correcting misperceptions about London's life. 
</P>
<P>
 In a biography to be published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux late next year, 
Labor plans to address such topics as London's love affair with socialist Anna 
Strunsky, his relationship with his stepsister, the cause of his premature 
death in 1916 and his achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contrary to published stereotypes of London at the end of his life as an 
alcoholic, drug-ridden, burnout case, he was undergoing a crucial personal and 
philosophical transformation," Labor said. 
</P>
<P>
 London packed a lifetime plus into 40 years. A year before his death he wrote: 
"I have been luckier than many hundreds of millions of men in my generation 
have been lucky, and, while I have suffered much, I have lived much, seen much, 
and felt much that has been denied to the average man. Yes, indeed, the game is 
worth the candle."

 CRYSTAL CLEAR: It's usually not cheap to shop at Crystal Court at South Coast 
Plaza. But tonight your money could go for a cause. . . . The mall is hosting 
"Passport to End Hunger," an annual food- and wine-tasting benefit for the 
Orange County Food Distribution Center. You can sample cuisine from 40 local 
restaurants. It's $35, but that covers everything you can eat or drink. Over 
the past 10 years, the nonprofit group based in Orange has given away nearly 10 
million tons of food to the hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 JEWEL FISH: A Huntington Beach environmental group has renewed its drive to 
make the Garibaldi -- a bright orange fish named after an Italian general -- 
the state's official fish. . . . "They're living jewels representing all that's 
good about California," says Jim Hall of Ocean Futures. The group is convinced 
that the state designation would protect the fish from the nets of unscrupulous 
aquarium collectors, who have fought past measures. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE'S IN THERE: You might say Cecilia Fannon has put more of herself into her 
newest play than ever before. She has used bits of her own personality to 
create characters in the past, but in "Green Icebergs" one of the main roles is 
modeled directly on her. But which one? She's not saying. . . . "I'm definitely 
in there," the Newport Beach playwright says. "Green Icebergs" previews Friday 
at South Coast Repertory's Mainstage and will have its world premiere on Oct. 
21 (OC Live!). 
</P>
<P>
 POND DWELLERS: This is the time of year when they're supposed to be thinking 
hockey at The Pond of Anaheim. The Mighty Ducks, of course, are awaiting a 
resolution to the lockout. But there is basketball to be touted. . . . The 
Anaheim Chamber of Commerce is rounding up people for its luncheon Monday at 
the Anaheim Hilton and Towers for the Los Angeles Clippers' players and 
coaches. The Clippers play eight games at The Pond this year -- the first a 
preseason game Tuesday night against the Lakers. Luncheon tickets: $40.

 FERRARO: The Post Office is fighting City Hall. Or, to be more exact, City 
Councilman John Ferraro. It turns out that Ferraro, who leases a Woodland Hills 
building to the U.S. Postal Service, hasn't made quake repairs, and the postal 
workers are pretty perturbed (B1). . . . Ferraro says he's been slowed by a new 
seismic retrofitting law.

 BUEN PROVECHO: So what if scientists say Mexican food is bad for you? Times 
staffer Jeannette Regalado, an experienced Mexican food eater, went out and did 
her own informal study (B5). . . . And while she agrees it ain't exactly health 
food, it has cultural significance. Not only that: It's what a lot of people 
love to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 PROTEST: Proposition 187 found more controversy Wednesday when protesters 
confronted former INS Regional Director Harold W. Ezell (above) at the 
Sportsmen's Lodge before he spoke to a Republican women's group (B1). . . . 
Ezell, co-author of the proposal that would restrict services for illegal

 TOUGH CUT: Nothing personal, the San Francisco Giants say about the firing of 
their longtime Valley-based scout George Genovese. Baseball is a business, and 
the team had to "operate leaner and meaner" (C10). . . . Genovese played one 
season in the big leagues, with the Washington Senators in 1950. In 1952, he 
was hired as a minor league coach in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization by 
Branch Rickey.

 BENEFIT: Speaking of hard times in the national pastime, baseball players 
didn't always make big money, and now many older ex-players have big money 
problems. So, on Wednesday, a softball game was played in Burbank to help out 
ex-major leaguers. . . . A $5,000 check was presented to the Baseball 
Assistance Team by Disney on behalf of the Fox Television show "Hardball," 
which played a team of Playboy Playmates. The Playmates won, 14-13. Michael

<P>
 Building the last 85-mile link of the Pan American Highway between Colombia 
and Panama would cause serious environmental damage, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, funded by the government, threatened to further stall a 70-year 
dream to join the Americas, from Alaska to Argentina, by highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The study says the highway and accompanying deforestation would endanger the 
rich ecosystem of the Darien Gap jungle, home to more than 450 types of birds, 
500 species of vertebrates and rare plants.

CAR CRASH SPURS PUSH AT SCHOOL FOR SAFE DRIVING; ACCIDENT: THREE CAPISTRANO 
VALLEY STUDENTS REMAIN HOSPITALIZED AFTER FIVE-VEHICLE COLLISION IN WHICH 10 
WERE INJURED. 
</P>

 Calls and cards flooded local hospitals Wednesday for three students from 
Capistrano Valley High School seriously injured in a five-car crash. 
</P>
<P>
 And on campus, staff and student leaders spread a message of safety through 
the hallways. Student body President Ryan Hawkins, a senior, took to the public 
address system during third period Wednesday morning to stress the importance 
of using seat belts and obeying speed limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "People try to hurry to get to school and sort of drive recklessly," Hawkins 
said Wednesday afternoon. "I just encouraged people to wear their seat belts 
and drive safely to school and everything. I made a comment about leaving a 
little earlier to school instead of trying to speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Jessica Gorman distributed a memo to all staff containing 
information about the accident and collected signatures on a giant get-well 
card in her office for the victims. Hawkins and other students started 
organizing a safe-driving campaign on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids at school are rallying," Gorman said. "From (our) point of view, the 
faculty and staff are definitely concerned about our kids' safety on the way to 
school, and the way home, and on weekends. Safety and welfare of the kids is 
the first thing we think about." 
</P>
<P>
 Police are still investigating the five-car accident, in which 10 people were 
injured Tuesday morning at Marguerite Parkway and Estanciero. But they believe 
that in a carful of six Capistrano Valley students, only driver Kenneth Wong 
was wearing a seat belt, said Orange County Sheriff's Sgt. Fred Lisanti. Three 
of the victims were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department of Motor Vehicles records show that Wong first received his 
driver's license in February and had no speeding tickets or accidents before 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police Wong was weaving through traffic at 70 m.p.h. when his 
1991 Toyota sedan sideswiped another car, careened through an intersection, 
struck two other vehicles, then flipped and landed on its roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong, 18, remained in serious condition at Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center Wednesday, with two bones broken in his left leg, one bone broken in his 
left arm, and a concussion, according to hospital spokeswoman Wendy Harle. 
</P>
<P>
 But the status of two other accident victims had improved slightly Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sroothi Jaikumar, 14, underwent emergency surgery Tuesday night after doctors 
discovered that she had two broken ribs, and was in serious condition in the 
intensive care unit at Children's Hospital at Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center. Linda Chang, 15, who sustained head injuries in the crash, was 
transferred out of intensive care and was in fair condition Wednesday 
afternoon, said Children's Hospital spokeswoman Andrea Pronk. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other crash victims who were not hospitalized, first cousins Jade 
Gjestland, 14, and Kristin Kaewmanee, 16, declined to discuss the accident 
Tuesday. Tuey Gjestland, Jade's mother, said the girls spent most of the day 
napping as they nursed their injuries at home in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong had been driving the girls to school daily for about two weeks, Tuey 
Gjestland said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to talk to (them about the accident) now until (they're) feeling 
better," she said. "I just don't believe what's happening. I think there are 
circumstances I still don't know. I want to find out more before I draw a 
conclusion on what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth student in Wong's car, Lewis Chow, 16, could not be reached for 
comment.

DARK DAY FOR DR. NEON; 'THEY SAID, "YOU'RE FAT AND FAMOUS -- AND WE'RE HUNGRY," 
IT WASN'T A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS.' DR. NEON; LONGTIME LAGUNA FIXTURE SAYS 
ROBBERS CITED HIS CELEBRITY AS THEIR MOTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This time, Dr. Neon's flash may have drawn the wrong attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The colorful Laguna Beach neon artist -- who drives a 1969 ambulance bearing 
his moniker and once outfitted a sports car with mock machine guns -- says his 
local celebrity status drew a group of shotgun-wielding men who bound and 
blindfolded him for three hours Tuesday night while they robbed his home and 
motorcycle-supply business. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'You're fat and famous -- and we're hungry,' " said Dr. Neon, 41, 
a longtime local fixture whose real name is Alexander Evans. "It wasn't a 
random act of kindness." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said four or five robbers made off with more than $50,000 in goods, 
including sound equipment, antiques and a prized, fire-engine red Mercedes 
convertible. But they left behind the familiar ambulance -- and Evans' "rocket 
bus," a customized, purple and black transit bus trimmed inside with neon 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt it occurred -- it's just why it occurred," said Detective 
Jason Kravetz. "He was definitely singled out." Kravetz appealed to the public 
for help in finding the brown-topped Mercedes, whose California license plate 
is 3HGE551. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said he was in bed watching a television documentary about 10 p.m. when 
two men in black clothing and ski masks burst through a sliding door and poked 
a shotgun into his face. "They told me if I moved, they'd kill me," he said. 
The men bound him at the wrists and ankles, then blindfolded and gagged him as 
they were joined by two or three other men he could not see. 
</P>
<P>
 "They taped me up. They trussed me up like a pig," Evans said, bearing bruises 
and cuts on his wrists and ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 A neon artist now better known for his custom motorcycle gear, Evans is a 
familiar figure around Laguna Beach and among Orange County's biker set. His 
own neon-trimmed riding helmet looks like something out of "The Rocketeer," and 
Evans uses the converted tour bus to haul his stylized Harley-Davidson 
motorcycles to trade shows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The walls of his cluttered shop bear newspapers clippings chronicling Evans' 
knack for the eccentric, including the time in 1991 when he mounted mock 
machine guns on the back of a Triumph convertible and equipped it with sound 
equipment that blared taped gunfire and screams. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, he said, the attention was unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans described the intruders as men aged 18 to 24, dressed in black shorts 
and shirts and wearing black boots and red-trimmed black ski masks. 
</P>
<P>
 As he lay bound on his bed with his Lhasa apso named Harley nearby, Evans said 
he listened to the men carrying out his belongings, which ranged from keyboard 
equipment to custom-made, silver cowboy boots, size 13. He said the men 
repeatedly demanded cash and threatened to shoot him, but he told them his home 
business -- a mail-order supplier of neon automotive ornaments and motorcycle 
accessories -- operated on checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said the intruders were polite and "professional," offering to bring him 
drinks of water and taking only the most valuable items from the adjoining shop 
and sound studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was four guys on a shopping spree -- like they were on a TV show," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At several points, Evans said, one of the men told him he had been targeted 
because he was well-known and presumed rich. Evans said he was able to free 
himself as the robbers were leaving and surprised one of them with a machete 
from his closet. The man fled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, who said he has soured on California because of its motorcycle helmet 
law and politics, said the robbery has scared him into planning to leave the 
secluded Laguna Canyon cabin that last year narrowly escaped the wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here because I didn't want to live in the crime-ridden city and now 
it's chased me out of here," he said. "I'm out of here."

SMALL BLASTS WILL YIELD QUAKE DATA; SCIENCE: FEDERAL GEOLOGISTS WILL SET OFF A 
SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS FROM SEAL BEACH TO THE MOJAVE DESERT TO MAP THE L.A. 
BASIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Federal scientists will be setting off small, underground explosions and 
undersea bursts of compressed air over the next two weeks, seeking a "CAT scan" 
of the Los Angeles Basin for earthquake study. 
</P>
<P>
 The seismic waves created by the mini-explosions and compressed air will be 
measured by 600 seismographs in Orange and Los Angeles counties and will help 
scientists learn when earthquakes are likely to happen and where they will be 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning today, bursts of compressed air will be shot from gun mechanisms 
trailing the research vessel Ewing as it makes a seven-day voyage from Long 
Beach Harbor to San Clemente Island and back, a spokesman for the U.S. 
Geological Survey said. The bursts generate sound waves that travel through 
water and rock and can produce an image of the Earth's crust beneath the Los 
Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, only Seal Beach residents may hear some dull thuds at night 
from Oct. 23 to 30, when the underground explosions will occur, said Jim Mori, 
survey spokesman. The blasts will range from 250 pounds of explosives in most 
urban sites to a maximum of 4,000 pounds in a remote area of the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time an imaging map survey has been done for Southern 
California," Mori said. "We have done tests like this for many years and 
recently completed one in Northern California. It's to give us the first look 
at the underground geologic structures. That includes things like faults, the 
roots of mountains and, generally, what the shapes of the Los Angeles Basin 
look like." 
</P>
<P>
 Of special note, Mori said, is the potential to map and provide geologic 
information about blind thrust faults, similar to the fault that produced the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. Such a fault, Mori said, produces vertical 
motion, unlike a strike-slip fault, which produces horizontal motion. The 
"blind" aspect refers to a fault that does not come to the surface and is not 
readily identifiable, unlike California's San Andreas fault, which is plainly 
visible, Mori said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to see that blind, or buried, thrust faults are a lot more 
difficult to identify," Mori said, "and (that's) one of the reasons we need the 
special sensing techniques to find them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Oct. 23, a series of about 60 small explosions will be detonated in 
drill holes between 60 and 130 feet deep. Mori said that seismographs will be 
deployed from Seal Beach northeast in nearly a straight line into Los Angeles 
County, through the San Gabriel Mountains and into the Mojave Desert. Mori said 
this path was chosen because it crosses the Los Angeles Basin at a less 
populated angle and it passes locations where major earthquakes occurred in 
Long Beach, Whittier and Sierra Madre. 
</P>
<P>
 Mori said the blasts would have no significant environmental impact, according 
to numerous previous tests and environmental assessments by the U.S. Geological 
Survey. The explosive used is ammonium nitrate, the same ingredient in many 
fertilizers, mixed with inert additives. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists and technicians generally detonate the explosives from a few 
hundred feet away, and occasionally some gravel is ejected from atop the 
explosives and lands within 100 feet of the blast, Mori said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach City Manager Jerry L. Bankston said that two U.S. Geological Survey 
representatives made a presentation before the City Council about two weeks ago 
and won unanimous approval for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The representatives assured council members that the blasts would have no 
effect on artillery at the naval weapons station, Bankston said.

TARP HANDOUT DRAWS HEROES, ENTREPRENEURS; CAMARILLO: KINDNESS AND CAPITALISM 
MEET AS RESIDENTS LINE UP FOR PLASTIC COVERS TO PROTECT THEIR CARS AND OUTDOOR 
FURNITURE. ALL IN ALL, THE MOOD IS TRANQUIL.

 Some residents saw it as a time to help. Others seized the moment to try to 
make a little extra cash. And a few couldn't pass up the chance to argue about 
the big issue of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating the first night of aerial malathion spraying, hundreds of 
Camarillo and Somis residents lined up for free plastic covers to protect their 
cars and patio furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 The supplies ran short at times during the day until relief trucks arrived. A 
temper or two flared occasionally. But there were also quiet acts of kindness. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Conroy, a Camarillo resident and the owner of Conroy Farms, was among the 
battlefield heroes on the first day of what turned out to be a relatively 
tranquil opening of Camarillo's war against the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy was helping pass out free tarps near Dos Caminos Plaza on Wednesday 
when he starting chatting with Chris Baker, a kindergarten teacher worried 
about protecting the picnic tables at Carden School in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the afternoon, Conroy dispatched his farm supervisor to deliver a 
13-foot-wide roll of plastic sheeting to the private, nondenominational school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brought in one of those big rolls of plastic, and said to give them a call 
if we needed more," said Beverly Plunkett, the school's director. 
</P>
<P>
 Plunkett said the school now should have enough plastic to cover the picnic 
tables, jungle gym and sandlot play areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very, very nice of them." 
</P>
<P>
 As the day passed, there were occasional moments of friction. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Smith of Somis was drawn into a debate while waiting in line for the 
free plastic covers. And he decided he was not about to allow a woman 
collecting signatures against aerial spraying to spread what he considered to 
be misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You like to eat, don't you?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, she liked to live, too." 
</P>
<P>
 "It went along those lines and whatever she said, I rebuffed her," the Somis 
resident recounted. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith added that he uses pesticides on his own avocado trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spray with a short-sleeved shirt on. I can feel the mist in my face and my 
arms. I never had any ill effects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the debate over malathion, there was some controversy over 
whether local capitalists ought to be making a profit out of the agricultural 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizing on the intermittent shortages of plastic covers in the area, a pair of 
fast-moving entrepreneurs started out early selling plastic tarps from the back 
of pickup trucks -- until being shooed off by city workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We paid $1.99 apiece for them and we were selling them for $3 apiece. A lot 
of stores have more of a markup than that," said Bret Atiyeh of Camarillo. "We 
drove out of town to get them. I felt we were providing a service." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the opportunity for a quick profit, Atiyeh said he and a friend, David 
Goodman of Camarillo, loaded up on the plastic tarps and tape at hardware 
stores in neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really did it to help people and have a little bit of an entrepreneurial 
spirit," said Goodman, a candidate for the Port Hueneme City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he shut down after being instructed not to sell the tarps on city 
property and spent the rest of the day helping people tape plastic coverings 
over their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Atiyeh said he was startled when city officials informed him that he could not 
sell anything out of his car.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody got angry at me," Atiyeh said. "A lot of people thanked me because 
they didn't have to wait in line. It wasn't like we were selling batteries 
after the earthquake for six bucks apiece." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Brose, supervisor of the district attorney's consumer protection 
division, said such a sale could violate a county ordinance passed shortly 
after the Jan. 17 earthquake to discourage price gouging during disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brose said his office would investigate such a matter only if there were 
complaints from residents who believe they fell victim to prices inflated at 
least 10% above normal retail. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, he said, the county's ordinance only covers unincorporated areas 
of the county and has no force within the city limits of Camarillo, which he 
believes has no such price-gouging law. What to Do State and federal agencies 
report that malathion has been studied extensively, and there is no evidence 
that it causes cancer, birth defects, nerve damage, eye damage or cumulative 
injury. But residents are cautioned to avoid exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also recommend that the following precautions be taken after 
spraying: 
</P>
<P>
 * If in contact with spray, wash residues from skin and clothing with soap and 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not leave laundry outdoors when spraying is scheduled. If laundry is 
soiled, rewash before wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your car is outside during spraying, wash it the next day to prevent 
paint damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse plastic skylights and awnings the day after spraying to prevent 
permanent stains. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cover fish ponds before spraying and uncover shortly after to minimize water 
contamination while avoiding oxygen depletion. 
</P>
<P>
 * After an area has been sprayed, wash outdoor eating areas, playground 
equipment and objects such as toys and pet food dishes that may have been 
outside during spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid harvesting home-grown fruits and vegetables for three days after 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse all fresh fruits and vegetables with water before cooking or eating 
them, just as you should with store-bought items. 
</P>

MISSION VIEJO CO. WILL FACE UPHILL BATTLE OVER PROPOSAL; DEVELOPMENT: BUILDER 
NO LONGER HOLDS SWAY IN THE COMMUNITY IT CONSTRUCTED. ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS 
RAISED OVER ITS LATEST PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A mammoth, 850-unit apartment and condominium complex proposed by the Mission 
Viejo Co. may test the developer's nearly unblemished record for getting 
projects approved in this planned community. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the Mission Viejo Co. has held all the cards -- courtesy of a 
development agreement signed with the county just months before a cityhood 
election in 1987. The agreement meant that the developer had all the necessary 
approvals to proceed with projects listed in the pact.  
</P>
<P>
 But with the signing of a new development deal with Mission Viejo in 1991 -- 
one that city officials say doesn't include the proposed high-density project 
on El Toro Road -- the city may finally have the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we signed a new development agreement with the Mission Viejo Co., it 
changed everything," Councilman Robert D. Breton said. "They no longer have us 
over a barrel. It feels good to have the tables turned." 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents and council members are appalled at the prospect of adding up 
to 2,500 people along an environmentally sensitive stretch of El Toro Road near 
the county's canyon communities.  
</P>
<P>
 Also opposing the development is the county Airport Land Use Commission, which 
has recommended against the project because it lies under the flight path of 
military jets heading to the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Stu Halbert called the project "a bad deal. The development agreement 
is supposed to limit the amount of people in the city. I don't think the city 
is going to like the environment this is going to create." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists are unhappy because the site is near a wildlife corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's terrible. There are definitely gnatcatchers up there," said 
resident Kay Stockwell, referring to the controversial songbird that is listed 
as a threatened species. If a residential complex is built there, she said, 
"people will now be walking around out near the ridgelines where they nest." 
</P>
<P>
 The complex would be built on 50 acres next to El Toro Road, about a mile 
north of Santa Margarita Parkway. The developer will ask for a zoning change 
and an amendment to the city General Plan at a Planning Commission meeting 
Monday, and before the City Council on Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo Co. spokeswoman Wendy Wetzel Harder said the extra people should 
not be a concern because Mission Viejo was originally envisioned for a 
population of 90,000. The city now is home to 82,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has done tests that show noise levels from passing jets are no 
higher there than in other areas of Mission Viejo, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for environmental concerns, traffic studies done by the company have shown 
that a business park previously approved by the city for the site would create 
more traffic than the proposed residential development, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the widespread opposition, the project might be approved -- for a 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the last major development approved in Mission Viejo -- a tract of 
700 single-family homes -- came with a commitment from the Mission Viejo Co. to 
donate to the city 60 acres of open space and build youth ball fields worth 
about $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, the city has one overwhelming need. A majority of residents want a 
new library built, but don't want the city to pay for it entirely out of 
reserve funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first issue is whether this development is negotiable at all," Breton 
said. "But if the price is right . . . funding construction of the library 
would certainly be attractive." 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CYPRESS; COUNCIL WILL NOT TAKE A STAND ON PROP. 187 
</P>

<P>
 City Council members have announced that they will not take a stand on 
Proposition 187, the initiative that would deny health and education services 
to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Partin said Tuesday night that council members do not believe 
taking a stand on statewide initiatives is appropriate."It's not our place," 
Partin said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 12, Cypress resident Doris Shyken petitioned the council to endorse 
the initiative, which is backed by an organization called Save Our State. Three 
council members responded that night that they believed something should be 
done to halt illegal immigration. But council members agreed that no vote 
should be taken until they had the full text of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 26, two other Cypress residents appeared before the council, urging 
the members not to endorse Proposition 187. Those residents, Father Mike Heher 
of St. Irenaeus Catholic Church and teacher Carolyn Pryor, told the council 
that they believe the initiative is wrong and harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed endorsement was on the council's agenda Tuesday night, but the 
matter never came up for a vote or discussion. Instead, Partin said the council 
had decided to take no stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Shyken was in the audience Tuesday night but she did not speak to the council. 
She later said she was "very disappointed" that the council took no stand on 
Proposition 187, as have some other Orange County cities, including Tustin and 
Huntington Beach. "Our borders are being deluged by people coming here against 
our laws," Shyken said. BILL BILLITER

 A remodeled theater at Golden West College will open Friday night with a new 
name and almost doubled seating capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly called the Actor's Playbox, the redesigned facility is now called the 
Stage West Studio Theater. Seating in the old Actor's Playbox was limited to 
50; the new theater has room for 99. 
</P>
<P>
 College spokeswoman Kelly Vander Lans said the redesigned theater still 
"offers patrons an intimate theater experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Fine arts Dean David Anthony added: "The facilities now parallel the wonderful 
productions being staged." 
</P>
<P>
 The remodeled theater's debut show is the British comedy "Taking Steps." It 
plays through Oct. 23 at 15744 Golden West St. For times and ticket 
information, call (714) 895-8378. BILL BILLITER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CYPRESS; COUNCIL WILL NOT RECONSIDER WAREHOUSE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angry cries of "Recall! Recall!" resounded from a standing-room-only audience 
this week as the City Council refused to reconsider its decision favoring a big 
warehouse project. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents took up all 100 seats in the council room Tuesday night, and about 
25 more stood along the walls. Most came to testify against the project, which 
the council approved last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The 439,650-square-foot warehouse at 11400 Valley View St. would be used as a 
wholesale distribution center for Shaw Industries, a Georgia-based carpet 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby homeowners pleaded in vain with the council on Sept. 26 not to approve 
the project. They returned Tuesday night to ask for reconsideration and seek 
answers to a variety of questions about the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not being heard, and I feel we should be heard," said resident Dave 
Conde. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members responded that they had already weighed pro and con 
testimony on the project and declared the matter settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to withdraw the decision," said Councilwoman Cecilia L. Age. 
"As far as putting this back on the agenda to withdraw our decision, we're not 
going to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 After several residents in the audience addressed the council to protest the 
warehouse, Mayor Richard Partin announced that he was cutting off further 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had 37 minutes of comments on this one item, and we're going to have to 
move on," Partin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience exploded into verbal protest, with several people chanting 
"Recall! Recall!" The council took a five-minute recess, and most of the 
homeowners left the council room. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have charged that the warehouse project will increase traffic and 
noise, lowering property values. The City Council has said that the warehouse 
will have minimal environmental impact and will bring Cypress $12 million in 
new sales taxes over the next 10 years. BILL BILLITER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; CABLE FIRM TOLD TO FIX FILM FEED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cablevision of Orange said it will consider informing its 24,000 subscribers 
that their homes might be receiving unscrambled adult movies on channels 44 and 
45. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen angry residents attended a meeting Tuesday to demand that 
the City Council force Cablevision to resolve technical glitches that have 
allowed children to view the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Chuck Davis described an unscrambled feed of the Playboy channel he 
received about 5 p.m. within earshot of his 10-year-old son and four-year-old 
daughter. The movie featured oral sex acts, "complete with sound," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristy Casasanta, general manager for the cable company, placed the blame on a 
1992 federal law mandating that cable companies carry certain programs. 
Cablevision decided to that Hot Choice and Playboy share channels with other 
programming. The adult channels should have been scrambled after 5 p.m. in 
homes that did not subscribe to the channels. But some boxes "were not getting 
the message," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casasanta said the adult programs now have their own channels, which should 
solve the problem. But the audio feed is a problem that affects cable companies 
"industrywide," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members agreed that many working parents might not be aware of the 
problem and they urged Casasanta to send some type of letter informing 
subscribers about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Jim Evans said he will prepare a strong letter from the 
council to Time-Warner Inc., which owns Cablevision of Orange, to "insist that 
it be fixed." 
</P>
<P>
 The franchise renewal for Cablevision of Orange is scheduled for April 30 and 
includes a series of public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Spurgeon said the company "will have to make some moves very 
quickly before any of us can seriously consider holding hearings (about 
franchise renewal)." LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; OFFICERS SQUARE OFF IN A BATTLE OF SKILLS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Motorcycle police officers make riding look easy, deftly guiding 700-pound 
machines between cars and then zooming off toward an accident or crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as was evident Wednesday at an Orange County Traffic Officers Assn. 
skills competition in Santa Ana, agility and command on a police motorcycle 
come from hours of practice at precision maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone who doesn't know what they're doing is a liability out there," said 
California Highway Patrol Officer Jeff Giovinetti, 38, as he awaited his turn 
to tackle the hairpin curves, figure eights and slalom patterns of the 
proficiency course on his Kawasaki Police 1000. 
</P>
<P>
 Giovinetti, of Huntington Beach, scored a perfect 110 points and placed second 
overall in the 45-officer competition, to the delight of his wife, Maria, who 
has watched him compete five years in a row, and his 2-year-old son, Tony, who 
ran a tiny toy motorcycle along the seat of dad's motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The skills competition, which pitted officers from nine local police agencies 
against each other, was intended to help the officers sharpen their 
concentration for riding smoothly in pinched spaces and amid road debris and 
other cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to ride defensively because people just don't see motorcycles," 
Santa Ana Police Sgt. Raul Luna said. "This gets the guys motivated to do a 
little more serious training and the end result is more proficient riders on 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 10 years, participating departments have taken turns holding the 
competition. This year's event was put on by the Santa Ana Police Department in 
the newly paved McDonnell Douglas parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an ambulance was on scene in case of an accident, only two officers 
"dumped" their bikes on the ground when they braked too suddenly entering a 
tight turn or failed to negotiate a curve.  
</P>
<P>
 They were not hurt, Luna said, "except for their egos." LYNN FRANEY

<P>
 Anno, a canine member of the Police Department, has paid his dues. The 
11-year-old Belgian Malinois, a drug-sniffing dog, is to retire in December. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the effort to raise $10,000 to purchase Anno's replacement, a 
5-kilometer run and walk will be held Oct. 22 at Mile Square Regional Park. The 
event is also intended to heighten awareness about the dangers of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 Anno, who this summer earned top awards at a statewide narcotics detection 
competition, has been partners for more than five years with Senior Officer Ray 
(Rocky) Rakitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Dann Bean said the department had hoped to keep Anno on the job 
until next July, but the dog needs to retire this year. "He's still active," 
Bean said. "We just don't want to push him too far." 
</P>
<P>
 Bean said the estimated $10,000 cost for a new dog includes training expenses. 
Right now the city cannot afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's other police dog is Hank, a German shepherd, who joined the 
force about eight months ago. Another German shepherd selected to replace Anno 
will be paired with Officer Tiffany Harper, Bean said.  
</P>
<P>
 Diane Tine, chairman of the "Goblin Gallop 5K Run and Walk," said the event's 
goal is to raise $10,000. The entry fee is $15. Registration will begin at 6 
a.m. and the event begins at 8 a.m. The winners in the men's and women's 
divisions will each receive $250.DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; COUNCILMAN IS FOUND TO BE IN VIOLATION OF THE 
CITY'S ZONING CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Councilman Peter F. Buffa must obtain a business license and a home 
occupation permit from the city before he can continue to work out of his home, 
the head of the city's Finance Department has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffa, who is seeking a third council term in next month's election, was found 
to be in violation of the city's zoning code because he had failed to secure 
the license and permit. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Thomas Kathe, who received the decision from finance director Susan 
Temple last week, said he agrees with the ruling on the business license but 
believes Buffa is in "a gray area" insofar as obtaining the permit required to 
run a business out of a home. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathe said the permit is not defined in the city's zoning code and, therefore, 
Buffa cannot be held accountable for not having one. "The code needs to be 
clarified," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffa, who has contended all along that he does not work out of his home, said 
that he uses his home as the corporate address for Petrone Productions, a 
television production consulting business he owns. He said the actual cutting 
and editing of videotapes is performed in an office in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Buffa said he will apply for a business license if Kathe advises 
him to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "But first I'm going to get a more definitive reading on this," he said. "I'm 
sitting with two different opinions from two different departments. But it's 
all part of 'silly season.' They don't call it 'silly season' for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffa claims that former City Councilman Orville Amburgey, a political foe, 
brought the matter to the council's attention at last week's meeting to make 
him look bad during election time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Amburgey said during the public hearing that he thought it was important 
that the council be aware that Buffa was working out of his home and did not 
have a business license. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should apply for a business license just like anybody else in the city who 
is doing business," Amburgey told the council.TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA, LA HABRA; EINSTEIN STAND-IN TAKES STUDENTS ON 
SCIENTIFIC QUEST FOR ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of students at Arovista Elementary School in Brea and Imperial and 
Washington middle schools in La Habra were treated Wednesday to science lessons 
conducted by none other than Albert Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
 With his bluish-gray wiry hair on end and dressed in a torn sweater, worn 
jeans and sneakers, actor Ed Metzger played the part of the late Nobel 
Prize-winning physicist to get students excited about science. 
</P>
<P>
 The students heard about Einstein's fascination with compasses and yo-yos -- 
toys that aroused his curiosity as a youngster and inspired him to wonder about 
such forces as gravity and inertia. Those questions opened a path to his famous 
theory of relativity.. 
</P>
<P>
 Einstein touched on a variety of topics ranging from energy to quantum 
mechanics and atomic research. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the magic ingredient that is the fastest thing in the universe?" 
Einstein asked enthusiastically during his first presentation Wednesday at 
Arovista. 
</P>
<P>
 "Light," a student responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Applause accompanied the correct answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Einstein's visit to the local schools was provided by Beckman Instruments of 
Fullerton as a community outreach program designed to get students interested 
in science. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are very impressionable and very curious, and this encourages them to 
ask questions," said Elke Eastman of Beckman Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 David Lipinsky, 11, said the program, "Close Encounters with Einstein," piqued 
his curiosity about science. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned about the atoms and why the sky is blue," David said. "I want to 
know more." 
</P>
<P>
 Arovista Principal Anne Flesher said she believes the students learned to seek 
out answers and solve problems through the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It let them know that the larger-than-life figures they read about are really 
regular people and that they, too, can be successful and productive members of 
society," Flesher said. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; PROBLEM OF TRAIN NOISE TO BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a testy debate with angry residents, the City Council this week approved 
a plan to study a nagging train noise problem in a residential community near 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who live near the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway tracks 
complained that having the city study the problem before acting means it will 
take too long to abate the noise, which they said has become unbearable since a 
second railway line opened in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not an acceptable solution to us," resident Kathy Wright said to the 
council. "You have a long-term plan we don't want to be involved with. We want 
a short-term plan. We want our lives back to normal, where they should be. We 
have a problem that's horrendous." 
</P>
<P>
 The residents want a sound wall built along the tracks, which run within yards 
of residences. This would cost an estimated $3 million, which the city said it 
cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will commission an environmental study and enlist financial support 
from nearby cities, county, state and federal transportation authorities. They 
will also explore creating an assessment district, so residents could pay for a 
sound wall. GREG HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; MAYOR SUGGESTS PUBLIC BENEFITS CORPORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outgoing Mayor Clarence J. Turner has asked city administrators to prepare a 
plan for a public benefits corporation that would accept and administer 
donations from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The new panel, approved in principle on a 7-0 vote, would consider which 
donations to accept and allow donors to specify the use for any money or 
property granted to the city, without danger that the donations would be 
mingled with the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should not cost the city a nickel except the relatively small amount of 
pocket change to set the corporation up," Turner said in asking for a proposal. 
He suggested the City Council could be the board of directors with appointed 
residents as corporate officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Evelyn R. Hart said the corporation should include residents who 
do not hold a political office, are not seeking political office and are not 
city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to do it I think we should keep politicians out of it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One resident, Dolores Otting, said even a corporation with good intentions 
could be misused. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that this could become a vehicle through which special 
interests and lobbyists could make large contributions to the city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jean H. Watt asked that administrators come up with a proposal to 
structure the corporation to preclude abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of some donations the city has received or been offered include a 
Bret Price sculpture donated in 1986, a scholarship fund in the name of former 
Mayor Donald Strauss and an offer of $30,000 worth of cherry trees. HOLLY J.

 The Police Department's shooting range will be upgraded so that officers can 
take their marksmanship qualifications in the city each month rather than spend 
two hours of paid time every other month to qualify elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday authorized the department to advertise for bids on 
the overhaul of its shooting range, which is expected to cost about 
$172,000.The range was closed in November, 1993, because of a failing air 
circulation system and concern over possible excessive lead exposure to users 
and employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach officers have been going to Fountain Valley every other month to 
qualify with their handguns, rather than qualifying monthly in their own 
station, which was the previous standard for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Modifications to the shooting range will include shortening it by seven feet 
and lowering its ceiling to eliminate some of the surface area where lead dust 
can collect and allow more fresh air to be piped in behind the shooting 
positions. Modifications will also be made to the electrical system. HOLLY J.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; SCHOOLS PLAN TO ADD ETHICS TO 
CURRICULUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Capistrano Unified School District board has decided to pursue an ethics 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 The district plans to send out a survey to parents, teachers, clergy, business 
leaders and others, seeking feedback about what the community believes should 
be taught.Students' opinions also will be gauged. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees gave initial approval to the idea Monday, saying it should be a 
separate curriculum in all grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take about a year to shape the curriculum, built around seven core 
values. Some examples might be things such as honesty, respect, trust, 
tolerance, courage or responsibility. A staff report lists 22 choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to have broad consensus," said Supt. James A. Fleming, who noted that 
adopting an ethics curriculum was part of the district's long-range plan, 
Capistrano 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees said the district has not failed to underscore values but was taking 
a step to make them a specialized area of study. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Smith, assistant superintendent of instructional services, told 
trustees that a 1992 national poll showed that people wanted values taught 
almost as much as reading, writing and arithmetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that a random targeted sampling of opinions for the curriculum 
would be less expensive than the estimated $400,000 to reach every household 
served by the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Paul B. Haseman said the district would not stop trying to 
promote values that do not make the final seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean that we are ignoring the others," Haseman said.JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA, NEWPORT BEACH; DRUG HUNTS EXTENDED TO MIDDLE 
SCHOOLS 
</P>

<P>
 A policy for bringing drug-sniffing dogs onto Newport Beach and Costa Mesa 
high school campuses was extended to include middle schools by the Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District board Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Ensign Intermediate School had requested participation, board member Rod 
MacMillian said, so the board agreed to authorize the searches in grades seven 
through 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members discussed the policy and a regulation submitted by the 
district's Alcohol Drug Tobacco Abuse Advisory Committee. The board will make a 
final decision on the policy on Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 The board had hoped to start the police dog sniff-searches of lockers and cars 
in the fall semester, but board members agreed Tuesday that it will take until 
the spring semester to put the plan into action. The board will evaluate the 
program at the end of the school year and decide whether to make it permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 As modified by the board, the policy and regulation include provisions to post 
notice of possible searches at each entrance to each campus, to include all 
autos on a campus in searches, not just those of students, and to respond with 
school discipline and rehabilitation programs rather than arrests whenever 
possible if drugs are found. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan to require a student's presence whenever his locker or car is searched 
will be reconsidered as a matter of student privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members were concerned that bringing a student out of class for any 
reason while the dogs were on a campus would implicate students with no drug 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great rumor-starter," MacMillian said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also complained that the policy does not address alcohol or tobacco, the 
most abused substances among high school youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The board wanted a minimum and maximum number of searches per campus per 
school year to ensure evenhanded application of the searches. HOLLY J. WAGNER

LAGUNA BEGINS TALKS ON AN EL TORO, CANYON LAND SWAP; TRADE: CITY MEETS WITH 
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT TO DISCUSS INCLUDING ACREAGE INTO THE AGENCY'S PROPOSAL TO 
GIVE THE BASE TO IRVINE CO. IN EXCHANGE FOR WILDERNESS LAND. 
</P>

 City officials said Wednesday that they have begun preliminary discussions 
with the federal government about the possibility of including a section of 
Laguna Canyon in a proposed land swap for El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussions involve land west of Laguna Canyon Road and between El Toro 
Road and the San Diego Freeway that the city is trying to buy from the Irvine 
Co. to preserve as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Smith, the city's lobbyist in Washington, met with Department of the 
Interior officials Wednesday, Smith's secretary said. Interior Department 
officials confirmed the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is hoping to have the acreage included in a possible land exchange 
proposed by the Interior Department in August. Under that proposal, the Irvine 
Co. would get part of the Marine base in exchange for wilderness land it owns 
next to the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine base is scheduled to close by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks also coincide with a proposal made public Tuesday by the Laguna 
Hills Audubon Society. Under that proposal, the Irvine Co. would be given most 
of the Marine base in exchange for environmentally sensitive land in Laguna 
Canyon and a promise that the base will not be turned into a commercial 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said that Laguna Beach has so far presented no 
formal proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had some preliminary discussions, very preliminary discussions, with 
Interior Department officials," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The property that Laguna Beach wants to include in a land swap was initially 
part of a larger 2,150-acre parcel known as Laguna Laurel that was slated for 
development by the Irvine Co. until the developer and the city struck an 
agreement in 1990 allowing Laguna Beach to buy the land in five parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 The city bought the first four parcels but does not have the money to make the 
final $33 million payment, due June 30, 1995. City officials had hoped to 
receive $25 million toward the purchase from Proposition 180, the California 
Parks & Wildlife Initiative, which voters rejected in June. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some dispute about the exact size in the final parcel, but it is 
between 147 and 189 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have been meeting periodically with Irvine Co. representatives 
in the hopes of extending the deadline for the final payment, but have reached 
no agreement yet. The next meeting is scheduled for Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Co. spokeswoman Dawn McCormick said company officials have not seen 
details of the Audubon proposal and do not know about the city's plan. She said 
the company reserves the option to build 1,500 homes on the land if the city 
cannot come up with the final payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have said publicly that if they aren't able to purchase it, we will 
develop it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said the Irvine Co. is still willing to work with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to move forward with the discussions on the payment, but 
those discussions are separate and distinct from any proposal that might be 
thrown out there about a possible land swap," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCormick added that the Irvine Co. is still continuing talks with the 
Interior Department about the land swap the government proposed in August.

SANTA ANA, LA HABRA GET U.S. FUNDS TO HIRE POLICE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: PRESIDENT 
CLINTON PASSES OUT FIRST OF MONEY FROM CRIME BILL. IT WILL PROVIDE 2,770 NEW 
OFFICERS ACROSS U.S., 20 OF THEM IN THE TWO O.C. CITIES. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton unwrapped the first fruits of this year's crime bill 
Wednesday, passing out about $200 million to communities nationwide -- 
including more than $2.1 million to Santa Ana and La Habra -- to hire more 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, distributed to local communities that applied to the Justice 
Department for the funds, will go to hire 2,770 police officers across the 
country -- the first installment of what Clinton hopes will be 100,000 more 
police over the next six years. The country now has about 550,000 police 
officers, Administration officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana expects to hire 15 police officers with its $1.7 million, while La 
Habra anticipates hiring five officers with $408,730, city officials said 
Wednesday. The federal grants will boost the ranks of Santa Ana's sworn police 
officers to 413, and La Habra's to 73. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you get additional funding it's always welcome news," said Santa Ana 
Police Chief Paul M. Walters. "Policing is not just arresting and apprehending 
people. It's about long-term solutions to neighborhood problems. (The money) 
will help us prevent crime before it starts." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with both cities said they will begin hiring the new officers as 
soon as they receive the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County received the largest single grant -- $3 million, which will 
go to hire 33 new officers. Also among the largest early beneficiaries were: 
Long Beach, which will receive nearly $2 million to hire 20 more police 
officers, and Compton, with $1 million for 10 officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In all cases, the local jurisdictions are required to pay part of the cost of 
the new hires and will be expected to keep them on the payroll after the 
two-year federal grants expire. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials emphasized that the money from the first round of 
anti-crime grants is going to parts of the country represented by both 
Democrats and Republicans. White House and Justice Department officials started 
the day armed with printouts showing that 44% of the money was going to 
congressional districts represented by Republicans -- including funds to towns 
represented by Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who led the Republican assault on 
the crime bill in the House, and Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 Under the anti-crime package that Congress passed in August after an intensely 
partisan struggle, cities, towns and counties that wish to share in the $8.8 
billion set aside for hiring police are required to submit plans to the Justice 
Department explaining how the new officers will be used in community policing 
projects that strengthen ties between officers and their communities. Justice 
Department officials determined the winners of the first round of grants by 
evaluating their policing plans and their violent crime and overall crime 
rates.

TRUSTEE CANDIDATES TO HAVE 2 FORUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's League of Women Voters will moderate two candidate forums this 
month for Newport-Mesa Unified School District board candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Three incumbents are leaving the seven-member board and one is seeking 
reelection.The unexpected departure of veteran board member Roderick H. 
MacMillian opens a seat that many previously thought was unattainable. 
</P>
<P>
 When MacMillian dropped out last week, citing ill health, only one opponent 
had filed for candidacy in Trustee Area 7. Since then, another has filed as a 
write-in candidate and others have indicated they are considering entering the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 League spokeswoman Judy Gielow said only candidates who have filed with the 
registrar of voters' office will be invited to the candidate forums. 
</P>
<P>
 They are scheduled Wednesday in the Loats Performing Arts Center at Newport 
Harbor High School, and Oct. 27 at the Little Theater at Corona del Mar High 
School. Both will begin at 7 p.m. and end by 9, Gielow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The forums, co-sponsored by the schools' PTAs and committees, are open to all 
Newport-Mesa voters. Candidates will draw lots for the order in which they will 
respond to questions solicited from the audience and screened for language and 
duplication by League members. 
</P>
<P>
 Gielow said civics teachers at both high schools have been asked to have 
students prepare questions and select representatives to ask them at the 
forums.

WOMAN CONVICTED UNDER '3 STRIKES' LAW; COURTS: JOYCE DEMYERS, FOUND GUILTY IN 
FELONY DRUG SALE, BECOMES SECOND IN COUNTY TO FACE SENTENCING UNDER STATE 
STATUTE REQUIRING REPEAT FELONS TO SERVE EXTENDED JAIL TERMS.

 The second Orange County defendant to be convicted under the controversial 
"three strikes" law is a 36-year-old woman with a history that includes 
robberies, burglaries and fraud and dates back to 1978 -- when she was charged 
with murder but later acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury found Joyce Demyers and co-defendant 
Rhonda Blakely guilty on Oct. 3 of a felony cocaine sale, stemming from a June 
arrest at an Anaheim motel, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of two prior robbery convictions, Demyers faces a prison term of 25 
years to life in prison when she is sentenced Oct. 28, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Another co-defendant, Martin Renteria, 26, was charged with both sale and 
possession and pleaded guilty. He faced up to nine years in prison because of 
prior drug convictions and was sentenced to a four-year term by Orange County 
Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes" law went on the books in March. Defendants convicted of 
two or more serious or violent felonies face 25 years to life in prison when 
they are caught on a third felony of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
 The first person convicted in Orange County under the "three strikes" law was 
Thomas G. Cargill, 35, of Huntington Beach. Cargill, who has two prior burglary 
convictions, was convicted of stealing a car from a used car lot. Sentencing is 
Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the law unfairly treats violent criminals the same as drug addicts 
or car thieves. But supporters say the law fights crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Demyers was acquitted in the November, 1978, killing of Bruce Vaughn Gedde, 
29, of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Her co-defendant in the murder case, Valerie Preston, was found not guilty by 
reason of insanity. Preston claimed she was insane when she shot Gedde.

MAN WHO DIED IN STRUGGLE OVER BEER STILL UNIDENTIFIED; INVESTIGATION: AUTOPSY 
TO DETERMINE CAUSE OF DEATH IS INCONCLUSIVE. SUSPECTED SHOPLIFTER DIED IN 
CONFRONTATION WITH FULLERTON STORE CUSTOMER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A man who died in an altercation over a 12-pack of beer that he allegedly 
shoplifted remains unidentified and the cause of death undetermined, a police 
spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Police Sgt. Glenn Deveney said that an autopsy on Wednesday failed 
to reveal what killed the man, who died in a fight with Mitchell Gohman, the 
customer who chased him when he allegedly walked out of a local convenience 
market Tuesday at noon without paying for the beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Deveney said that no charges have been filed in the death, and the 
investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we forward our findings to the district attorney's office, we have to 
determine if the force used by Gohman to apprehend the suspect was reasonable. 
No decision has been made whether to file charges against anybody," Deveney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gohman, an unemployed aviation mechanic, said he was saddened by the man's 
death but quickly added: "I don't feel bad that I tried to stop him from 
stealing something." 
</P>
<P>
 He said several officers congratulated him, calling him a hero, when he was at 
police headquarters for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I told the officers I didn't feel like a hero," Gohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gohman, he jumped in his car and went after the suspect when 
store owner, Yasmin Khan, yelled that he had left without paying for the beer. 
Gohman said he caught up with the man in the parking lot of a closed bank a 
block away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got out of the car and told him to put the beer down and put his hands on 
the car. He gave me a cold, hard stare and tried to swing the 12 pack at me," 
Gohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gohman got a headlock on the suspect and wrestled him to the pavement. The man 
never uttered a word during the altercation, Gohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was holding his head and neck, and had my back to him. I told him if he was 
good and nice and waited with me for the police to arrive I'd let go. I turned 
to look at him and saw his lips were bluish-gray and his mouth was foaming. I 
didn't realize it then, but I was talking to a dead man," said Gohman. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrived, "they considered doing (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) 
on him but decided to wait and let the ambulance crew do it," Gohman said. He 
said it took the ambulance about an additional minute or so to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man was known to patrol officers as Cipriano Martinez Vasquez and 
Maxamilliano Martinez. According to Deveney, police had stopped him several 
times in the past for questioning because he acted suspiciously. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan, 41, owner of K's Market, in a shopping center at West Orangethorpe 
Avenue and Harbor Boulevard, where the chase began, was still shaken Wednesday 
by the man's death.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel really bad that he died. I feel so bad about his death," said Khan, 
who has owned the store with her husband for three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said the deceased, who appeared to live on the street, seldom had 
money when he came in the store. According Khan, two or three times a week the 
man who died and two others would brazenly go to the beer section and leave 
with one can of beer each without paying. 
</P>
<P>
 "This happened so many times, but there was nothing I could do about it 
because I'm always alone in the store. My husband works in Santa Monica while I 
manage the store in the daytime," Khan said. "I told (the suspect) so many 
times that if he didn't stop stealing from me I would call the police. But he 
never listened." 
</P>
<P>
 Deveney said that police never received any complaints from Khan about the 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never called the police because I didn't want to make problems," Khan said. 
"I was also afraid that the men would get angry and hurt me if I reported them 
to the police. They knew that I was always alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to say whether the man had an arrest record, but they released 
a police mug shot of him. Deveney said the man had previously given officers 
two phony addresses, and added that police have not been able to locate his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we'd be happy to learn his real name. The autopsy results 
listed the cause of death as inconclusive. So, we don't know what killed him. 
They're going to have to do additional tests, and I have no idea when those 
results will be known," Deveney said.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / COSTA MESA; ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, APARTMENTS ARE DOMINANT 
ISSUES; THE BUSINESS CLIMATE -- HOW THE CITY ATTRACTS AND TREATS FIRMS -- ALSO 
GENERATES DISCUSSION. TWELVE CANDIDATES ARE SEEKING TWO OPEN COUNCIL SEATS NOV.

 This city isn't the sleepy little town it once was, and if you ask the 12 
candidates running for two City Council seats in the Nov. 8 election, many will 
say it's time for a change in leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though the issues vary, the top two concerns among candidates are coping with 
problems resulting from illegal immigration and getting a grip on the growing 
number of apartments cropping up to house them. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the apartments are bursting at the seams, defying occupancy standards 
set by city code, candidates contend. And the current council, with its 
"liberal policies," isn't doing enough, council hopeful Chris Steel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel, 53, a self-employed investor, suggests getting rid of the city-run Job 
Center on West 17th Street, a place where day laborers gather. He contends that 
early morning congregations, which have numbered as many as 300 people at a 
time, are a blight on the community and a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet L. McCammon, 35, a bank secretary, wants Costa Mesa residents to be 
served first and that all recipients of social services be screened for their 
legal status. She has made her support of Proposition 187, which would bar 
illegal immigrants from receiving public education, non-emergency health care 
and other social services, part of her platform. 
</P>
<P>
 McCammon and Steel, longtime residents of Costa Mesa, both think the city 
should put a stop to the influx of illegal immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 Steel's campaign theme is that unless city leaders make changes soon, "status 
quo will continue to flow."  
</P>
<P>
 James (Jimmer) Wysopal, 29, a lifelong Californian, proposes the political 
unthinkable: a "Forrest Gump kind of attitude" in running the city, where 
common sense would dictate difficult decisions, as in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 An exporter of novelty surf products, Wysopal would like to see more of the 
city's budget spent on capital improvements and less on employee salaries and 
benefits. Of this year's operating budget of $72 million, only $6 million is 
going toward capital improvements, while 60%, or $48 million, will be spent on 
the salaries and benefits for 500 city employees, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates are interested in generating more revenue by bringing more 
business to town. South Coast Plaza and Triangle Square are helpful, but more 
retail, and a stronger industrial base, would be welcomed, said Libby Cowan, 
another candidate hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan, 41, a Costa Mesa planning commissioner, proposes streamlining the 
process of applying for business permits. Applicants should be able to go to 
one place and get everything done instead of having to "jump from counter to 
counter in City Hall," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Costa Mesa planning commissioner in the running, Mark Korando, 43, 
said he wants to preserve existing neighborhoods while keeping growth in check. 
Both Korando and Cowan work for the city of Irvine -- Korando is a code 
enforcement officer, and Cowan is a community services superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if there is open space, it should be developed when it can, say 
candidates Bob Brady and Michael Collier, friends for five years and 
self-described conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Collier's platform: Bring the community together. No ethnic group should be 
afraid of the other, he said, and so the west side of town should not be 
segregated from the east, as is the case today, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be like the way you do things in a family," said Collier, 39, a 
father of three and a business manager of a thrift shop in Santa Ana. "We bring 
up all our problems and talk about them. We might not have the solution, but we 
could certainly try to solve the problem, and we could cut off all this racial 
tension before it gets really bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady, 44, the manager of a teachers' credit union, said he's running because 
"it's time to get some ordinary people in the running . . . and get away from 
people making a career of being politicians. . . . Sometimes we need a fresh 
look at things." 
</P>
<P>
 The two seats now open are Councilman Jay Humphrey's, who is stepping down 
after four years, and Councilman Peter F. Buffa, who's seeking a third term. 
The mayor, Sandra Genis, has served six years; Buffa, eight; and Councilwoman 
Mary Hornbuckle, 10. The only newcomer is Councilman Joe Erickson, with two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Michael Scheafer, 41, proposes creating more recreational facilities 
for the city's youth. A real estate agent and founder of Costa Mesa's first 
Little League, Scheafer would like to build more sports fields at Fairview 
Regional Park and create an atmosphere in which businesses would be welcomed to 
town, not frowned upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Monahan, 35, the manager of Goat Hill Tavern on Newport Boulevard, said 
that if he is elected, he would like to make the city "more business friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 "A big part of the reason I'm running is because the city is viewed as having 
a negative attitude toward business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan also advocates reducing crime by creating more Neighborhood Watch 
groups and keeping illegal immigration under control by supporting Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffa, 45, the incumbent, said that if he is reelected to a third term, he 
will continue to be a pro-business, anti-regulation voice on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described conservative, Buffa said he has never voted for a tax 
increase in his eight years in office. He cites among his accomplishments 
streamlining the application process to make it easier for businesses to open 
up in the city and saving the police helicopter program when its funds were in 
jeopardy two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For the city to continue its level of public services, Buffa said the city 
needs to maintain a strong business base. Content that the city's anti-gang 
unit has doubled from two to four officers in the last year, Buffa, a 
television producer, said he favors adding a fifth sergeant at the beginning of 
next year. He supported reopening the west-side police substation in the spring 
after it was closed for 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 On illegal immigration, Buffa said he favors Proposition 187 but thinks that 
the heart of the matter lies with the federal government doing its job and 
closing the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn David Clements, 27, a self-employed finance consultant, said that, as a 
council member, he would try to make Costa Mesa a safer city in which to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime is a big issue," he said. "It's important to bring safety and stability 
back to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Enticing more businesses to relocate to Costa Mesa is another priority on 
Clement's political agenda. He said the city's dealings three months ago with 
the Auto Club of Southern California was an example of how the city rubs some 
businesses the wrong way. He said the council made it especially difficult for 
the company to expand its headquarters on Scenic Avenue, even though the 
expansion was finally approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really made them fight for it, and it was a long, drawn-out process," he 
said.

DOWN ON THE TROUT FARM

 It began more than 20 million years ago, when the Earth's crust, stretched 
thin along the floor of a growing rift valley, unleashed immense outpourings of 
lava. In a series of cataclysmic events, 15,000 square miles of what is now the 
part of the American West from Yellowstone to Oregon were buried beneath 
thousands of feet of molten rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, this arid landscape is dotted with sagebrush and dissected by deep 
ravines and canyons. Named after the stream that etches a serpentine line 
across its length, Idaho's Snake River plain gives little hint of its fiery 
past -- or of the wealth that lies below. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawn from rain, snow and rivers, and secreted in fractures and tiny pockets 
of the porous volcanic rock, a vast store of water lies beneath the plain. This 
underground river moves covertly until interrupted by the Snake River valley, a 
40-mile stretch of river-cut cliffs. Here, in torrents and trickles, more than 
a million gallons of water a minute spring and seep from sheer rock walls. The 
water is crystal-clear, well oxygenated, a near-constant 58 degrees -- and a 
trout farmer's dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The region's potential for aquaculture was first recognized in 1928, when 
several small trout farms were built in the valley. More farms were added in 
the years following World War II. Today, three major producers and more than 75 
small contract growers harvest more than 40 million pounds of rainbows 
annually. Clear Springs Foods, the world's largest trout farm, began production 
in 1966 and now accounts for nearly half of that total. 
</P>
<P>
 Trout have been cultured since the 14th Century, when a French monk discovered 
that their eggs could be artificially impregnated. But nearly 400 years passed 
before the world's first trout hatchery began operating in France. Initially, 
efforts focused on repopulating natural waters for sport fishing. Beginning in 
France, Denmark and Japan, trout farming spread throughout the world, arriving 
in the United States in 1864 with the building of a hatchery in New York state. 
</P>
<P>
 The culinary attributes of trout inevitably led to farm-raised fish destined 
for commercial markets. Today, rainbow trout are found on every continent but 
Antarctica and are among the most widely farmed fish in the world. Rainbows are 
farmed in all 50 states, but about 80% of the nation's production comes from 
the waters of Idaho. The Snake River Valley is one of the great success stories 
of aquaculture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At first, aquaculture might seem forbiddingly high-tech. But this is farming. 
The only difference is that the feedlots are filled with fish instead of 
cattle. Idaho trout farmers rely on an abundance of high-quality water and use 
gravity-fed raceways -- narrow, concrete-lined pools that channel the water -- 
to hold the fish until maturity in an easily controlled environment. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many advantages to farming fish over hunting them. Fish farmers can 
easily manage each stage of the fish's life. Through selective breeding they 
can influence the size and even the sex of the fish. Rigorous attention to food 
and environmental conditions help to control growth rate. Because trout farmers 
can plan production to meet market demand, their fish can arrive very fresh, 
with little time spent in holding, processing or transport. The end result is 
reasonably priced fish, available year round, that are consistent in size, 
flavor and quality. MIKE WYATT

THE FISH KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYATT, Wyatt is managing editor of Simply Seafood magazine, in which 
this article first appeared.

<P>
 A glint of silver and a flash of fractured light -- blue, green and red -- 
mark the spot where a moment before a fish had been. In the dappled fast-water 
world of mountain streams, the rainbow trout reigns supreme. It is a fish that 
stirs the imagination of fishermen and cooks alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Named for the "rainbow" band that runs the length of its olive-green skin, the 
rainbow trout is America's most popular sport fish. Wild trout are prized by 
fly fishermen for their fierce spirit and wily nature (and "catch and release" 
is the honored rule). Plentiful fish from hatchery-stocked lakes and streams 
are the mainstay of many a family fishing trip -- and many a fish fry. And 
those with a taste for "catching" trout without a hook can find farmed fish at 
almost any seafood counter. 
</P>
<P>
 The culinary appeal of rainbow trout is simple: The flesh is mild and tender, 
and the bones are few and easy to remove. The small, consistent size of farmed 
rainbows makes offering uniform portions a breeze. Whole or in fillets, this 
fish holds up well in a variety of recipes and techniques. It can be baked, 
boiled, poached, grilled, steamed, pan-fried -- about the only preparation not 
well suited to the trout is stir-frying, because quick stirring over high heat 
breaks up the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Farm-raising trout allows producers to easily control growth and provide fish 
that are consistently sized. Generally weighing 3/4 to 1 pound each, these 
trout offer a perfect single-serving size. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Farmed fish have a somewhat milder flavor than wild trout. They also have a 
consistent flavor from fish to fish and season to season, whereas wild trout, 
depending on where they are from and what they've been eating, can have varying 
degrees of flavor intensity. Flesh color varies as well, from creamy white in 
farmed rainbows to a deep salmon-pink in some wild fish. It's no coincidence 
that trout are members of Salmonidae, the same family as salmon. They are very 
similar in many ways -- body shape, flesh type, bone structure -- and, in fact, 
large trout are interchangeable with salmon in recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 With a lower oil content than salmon, farm-raised rainbow trout have only 138 
calories per 3 1/2-ounce serving, 59 milligrams cholesterol, 5 grams total fat 
and .9 gram of the beneficial omega-3 fatty acids. Figures for wild trout vary, 
depending on where they are from, but they will have fewer calories and less 
fat, including omega-3s, than farmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooked whole, possibly with a stuffing, the fish makes a generous serving. 
Some find eating a whole fish needlessly intimidating. It's easy. Simply cut 
the top fillet of the fish down to the backbone, then lift off and discard the 
whole backbone with ribs, tail and head (if still attached). The remaining 
fillet sits whole on the plate, ready for carefree eating. 
</P>
<P>
 Trout fillets will weigh 1/4 to 1/3 pound each, a perfect size for pan-frying 
or broiling. (If your seafood market has only whole trout, ask to have it 
filleted.) The easiest way to cook fillets is also one of the best. Simply coat 
the fillets in flour seasoned with salt and pepper, then pan-fry to a golden 
brown. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To make a quick sauce, transfer the cooked trout fillets to a plate and cover 
to keep warm. Then add a little white wine or lemon juice to the pan, with a 
nut of butter if you like, along with chopped fresh herbs, capers, thinly 
sliced mushrooms -- whatever you like -- and cook just to heat, then spoon over 
the trout. For hearty appetites, serve two fillet portions, or accompany one 
fillet with plenty of sauteed or steamed vegetables alongside. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its mild flavor, trout benefits from assertive companion 
ingredients, such as capers, dill, green or sweet red peppers, ginger, lemon 
and so on. Coating the fish in cornmeal instead of flour before pan-frying 
creates an incomparably nutty, crunchy coating for this delicate fish. Use your 
imagination. Add some of your favorite ingredients and create your own culinary 
version of trout. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Flavors from the Mediterranean coast -- olive oil, peppers, cumin and garlic 
-- are a delightful foil for the delicate flesh of trout. If you like, replace 
the trio of peppers with a single large sweet red, green or yellow pepper.  
</P>
<P>
 THREE-PEPPER TROUT 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 3 garlic cloves, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 medium sweet yellow pepper, cored and sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 medium sweet red pepper, cored and sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 medium green pepper, cored and sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon cumin seeds or 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground coriander 
</P>
<P>
 Dash ground cloves 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 4 large trout fillets, to equal 1 1/2 pounds total 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in large skillet. Add garlic and saute until 
tender, about 1 minute. Add sweet yellow, red and green peppers. Saute over 
medium heat, stirring occasionally, until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in 
cumin, coriander, cloves and salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to bowl and set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to skillet. Fry trout fillets, skin-side 
down, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn fillets and spoon peppers mixture over. Cover 
skillet and cook over medium-low heat until trout are opaque through thickest 
part, 6 to 8 minutes longer. Transfer trout and peppers garnish to warmed 
dinner plates and serve. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The thin skin of trout not only is edible but also a tasty contrast to the 
tender flesh. Here the skin cooks to delicate crispiness in a one-sided cooking 
method. A non-stick pan makes frying tidy, but a standard skillet may also be 
used. CRISP-SIDED TROUT WITH GINGER SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 4 large skin-on trout fillets, to equal 1 1/2 pounds total 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 bunch green onions, trimmed and thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sake or white wine 
</P>
<P>
 Dash red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
 Cut 3 shallow diagonal slashes in skin side of each trout fillet. Heat oil in 
large non-stick skillet and add fillets, skin-side down (2 at time, if skillet 
is not large enough). Cover and cook over medium-high heat until tops of 
fillets are opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove cover and continue cooking until 
skin is crisp and brown and flesh is opaque through thickest part, 2 to 3 
minutes longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Flip fillets, skin-side up, onto 4 warmed dinner plates. Add green onions and 
ginger root to skillet and cook, stirring, over medium heat until tender, about 
1 minute. Add soy sauce, sake and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until hot, 
about 30 seconds longer. Pour sauce over trout fillets and serve immediately. 
Makes 4 servings.

<P>
 Stuffed trout recipes may be a dime a dozen, but this one stands out from the 
crowd with nutty wild rice and zesty orange. If you like, remove the trout 
heads and tails before stuffing.  
</P>
<P>
 TROUT STUFFED WITH WILD RICE 
</P>
<P>
 1 large orange 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup wild rice 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup chopped onion 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup finely diced day-old bread, crusts discarded 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 tablespoons reduced-sodium chicken broth or water 
</P>
<P>
 4 (3/4 pound) whole cleaned trout  
</P>
<P>
 Finely grate 2 teaspoons zest from orange and reserve. Cut orange in half and 
squeeze juice. Add enough water to orange juice to make 1 1/2 cups liquid. 
Bring liquid to boil with dash of salt. Stir in wild rice. Return to boil. 
Cover and simmer over low heat until tender to bite, about 40 minutes. 
Carefully drain off any remaining liquid. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 1 tablespoon butter in medium skillet. Add onion and cook, stirring, 
until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in bread and parsley. Saute another 3 
minutes, then remove skillet from heat. Add wild rice, reserved orange zest, 
salt and pepper to taste and enough chicken broth to moisten. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse trout and wipe dry with paper towels. Season to taste inside and out 
with salt and pepper. Spoon 1/4 of stuffing into each trout. Place trout in 
lightly buttered baking dish and brush fish with remaining 1 tablespoon butter. 
Bake at 350 degrees until fish are opaque through thickest part (just behind 
head), 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer to warmed dinner plates and serve 
immediately. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>

 This recipe takes advantage of trout's versatility. Poached fillets are paired 
with crisp greens, toasted pine nuts and sun-dried tomato dressing. Any 
seasonal vegetables can be added. Slivered almonds can take the place of pine 
nuts.  
</P>
<P>
 TROUT SALAD ITALIENNE WITH SUN-DRIED TOMATO DRESSING 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup white wine 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 
</P>
<P>
 1 bay leaf, crushed 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 4 trout fillets, to equal 1 to 1 1/2 pounds total 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup pine nuts 
</P>
<P>
 1 head romaine or red leaf lettuce, rinsed and torn into bite-size pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1 small red onion, sliced into thin rings 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons capers, drained 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons minced sun-dried tomato 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare salad, pour about 1 1/2 inches water in large skillet and add wine, 
peppercorns, bay leaf and dash of salt. Bring to boil and simmer 2 minutes. Add 
trout and poach over medium heat until trout are opaque through thickest part, 
5 to 7 minutes. Drain and place fillets on paper towels to cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Scatter pine nuts in cake pan. Toast in oven at 350 degrees until golden 
brown, 5 to 7 minutes, shaking pan occasionally so nuts brown evenly. Set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 To make dressing, combine lemon juice, sun-dried tomato, mustard and salt and 
pepper to taste in small bowl. Whisk until salt has dissolved. Slowly add olive 
oil, whisking constantly so that dressing thickens slightly. Adjust seasonings 
to taste. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk salad dressing to mix and toss with lettuce in large bowl. Adjust 
seasonings to taste. Arrange greens on 4 chilled plates. Discard skin from 
trout fillets. Divide trout into large pieces and arrange over greens. Scatter 
onion rings, pine nuts and capers over salad and serve immediately. Makes 4 
servings.

<P>
 I love easy tricks for dressing up familiar foods. One tip that I learned in 
France is to use a fresh flavoring mixture called persillade to perk up simply 
cooked ingredients. A combination of minced parsley and garlic, persillade 
(pronounced pair-see-YAD) is used in the French kitchen to enhance cooked 
vegetables, fish and meat. Persillade comes from persil , the French word for 
parsley. Generally flat-leaf or Italian parsley is used, but persillade is also 
good made with curly parsley. 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, I discovered a similar seasoning blend called gremolata , a mixture 
of garlic, parsley and grated lemon or orange zest. This lively seasoning mix 
is best known as a finishing touch for the classic recipe for osso buco, or 
veal shanks in tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite in garlic-loving Provence, persillade often dresses up sauteed 
eggplant and mushrooms. Cooks in the region also stir it into cooked lentils to 
give them fresh color and flavor. Persillade is popular in the nearby Bordeaux 
area too, where a shallot sometimes replaces the garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 Both persillade and gremolata can provide a tasty accent to plainly cooked 
foods. For very little effort and only two or three ingredients, they provide a 
punch of flavor and color to sauteed or steamed vegetables. They lend zip to 
corn kernels, lima beans, canned beans or frozen mixed vegetables. I especially 
like the citrus flavor of gremolata as a foil for sweet cooked carrots. 
</P>
<P>
 When you have leftover chicken, turkey or meat, cut them into strips, heat 
them in a skillet or in the microwave with a little oil or broth, and finish 
them with either parsley-garlic mixture. Toss persillade or gremolata with 
plain hot cooked rice, pasta or couscous to quickly create a zesty side dish. 
Both seasoning blends make savory additions to any food in tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 After you add persillade or gremolata to cooked food, heat the dish for a 
minute or less to take the raw edge off the garlic and to blend the flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare these fresh mixtures, either chop the garlic and parsley with a 
knife or whir them in a food processor; a mini processor is particularly useful 
if you're making a half cup or less. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This easy vegetable medley makes a good accompaniment for roast chicken.  
</P>
<P>
 MUSHROOMS AND ZUCCHINI WITH PERSILLADE 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium garlic cloves 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup parsley sprigs, rinsed and dried 
</P>
<P>
 3 medium zucchini 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 8 ounces medium mushrooms, quartered 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 To make persillade, chop garlic in mini food processor. Add parsley and chop 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Halve zucchini lengthwise. Halve each piece again lengthwise, then cut into 
3/4- to 1-inch crosswise slices. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in large, heavy skillet. Add mushrooms, zucchini and salt and pepper 
to taste. Saute over medium-high heat, stirring often, 3 minutes. Add 
persillade and saute 30 seconds, stirring. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve 
hot. Makes 4 servings.

<P>
 The lemon-garlic flavoring called gremolata does wonders for plain cooked 
carrots, turning them into an exciting dish in no time.  
</P>
<P>
 CARROTS WITH GREMOLATA 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon finely grated or finely chopped lemon zest 
</P>
<P>
 1 small garlic clove, very finely minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons minced parsley 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups sliced carrots, of 1/8-inch-thick slices 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 For gremolata, combine lemon zest, garlic and parsley in small bowl. Mix 
thoroughly with fork. Cover and reserve at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Place carrots in saucepan and cover with water. Bring to simmer and cook until 
just tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 tablespoon cooking liquid. 
Return carrots to pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before serving, add oil to carrots. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Toss briefly over low heat until hot. Add reserved liquid. Sprinkle with

CITY HALL NEWS: DUARTE; CITY COUNCIL TENTATIVELY OKS 3% UTILITY TAX OVER 
OBJECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a hostile public hearing, the Duarte City Council tentatively approved 
a 3% utility tax Tuesday on a 3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents pledged to circulate a petition to force the issue onto the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is this council afraid to place (the tax) on the ballot?" asked Linos 
Paras, a leader of the Duarte Taxpayers Group. "Is it because most of the 
council members cannot convince the people it is truly needed?" 
</P>
<P>
 The tax, which would begin in February if it receives final approval, and run 
for four years, is expected to cost the average household an extra $84 a year, 
according to city officials. It would have low-income exemption and be applied 
to water, electricity, gas, telephone and cable bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The three council members who voted for the tax said there is no other way to 
make up a budget deficit for this year of about $500,000, short of resorting to 
widespread layoffs and slashing vital city services, such as Sheriff's 
Department programs, the library, graffiti removal and the senior center. 
Dissenters Mayor Margaret E. Finlay and Councilwoman Ginny Joyce agreed that 
the tax is necessary, but said the voters should decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not supporting this initiative because I still want input from the 
community," Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members John R. Fasana, James D. Kirchner and Phillip R. Reyes 
said local government is a representative democracy and that they would make 
the decision and live with the consequences of their votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city already cut $880,000 from this year's budget of about $17 million, 
said Kirchner, who had previously opposed any new taxes. "When you get down to 
it, you can't cut any more," he said. "It's not our position to let our 
community go into bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes, who also originally opposed the tax, said a dose of reality made him 
change his mind. "I don't see any other options at this point," he said, 
warning that further cuts would erode city services so badly that property 
values would drop. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the residents denounced the council majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Geelhoed, a Duarte resident, said he was amazed how often both 
Democratic and Republican politicians run on promises of no new taxes only to 
reverse their position once they are in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to know where the money is going. I want to know what the people are 
getting," resident Kathy Ross said. "I am extremely unhappy with the issue of 
this tax. I have been unemployed since March." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Steve Hernandez said he supports the tax but thought the council 
should explain the issue directly to as many citizens as possible before 
approving it.

 DIAMOND BAR: In response to a financial audit that found several gaps in the 
city's accounting procedures, the city has issued a memorandum defending itself 
against some criticisms and offering solutions to others. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorandum is available to citizens at the library and City Hall. An 
ordinance implementing the suggested reforms will be up for council vote Oct. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, which was released last month, found "no material weaknesses" in 
the city's accounting procedures. But it did find, among other things, that the 
city had no formal purchase order system, lacked centralized control over 
incoming invoices, had conflicts of interest in which duties that should be 
separated were assigned to the same employee, and had no formal vendor list. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorandum states that the city does in fact have a formal purchase order 
policy as well as a vendor list. In response to the audit, however, the city 
will separate conflicting financial responsibilities, and will route all 
invoices to the finance department and add safeguards to ensure proper 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 GLENDORA: The city has tentatively scheduled a public hearing Nov. 16 on a 
proposed 30-acre shopping center featuring a Super Kmart, which would include 
grocery sales, dry goods and light auto repair. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will consider the environmental impact report, which is expected 
to be in the city's hands within about a week.  
</P>
<P>
 The site of the center would be Lone Hill Avenue and Gladstone Street in a 
field that has been vacant for more than 30 years, City Manager Art Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 MONTEREY PARK: Harmony Month, a celebration of the city's cultural diversity, 
begins today with a sold-out film festival at the Edwards Theater, 400 S. 
Atlantic Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, City Hall will be the site of an open house from 9 a.m. to 1 
p.m., with tours of the Police and Fire departments and explanations of city 
government. From 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. there will be picnic games, food and music in 
Barnes Park next to City Hall.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; SPECIAL ELECTION CALLED TO RESOLVE COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week ordered a special election Feb. 7 to resolve a 
chaotic council race in central Long Beach, where the apparent loser emerged 
with a two-vote victory after a recount. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Donelon, a contractor who was declared the winner after the June recount, 
will face community activist Tonia Reyes Uranga. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga, who appeared to win by 29 votes, challenged Donelon's narrow victory 
in court, contending that ballots were improperly counted, among other 
problems. Last week, a Superior Court judge ordered the city to hold a new 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga said she plans to launch a voter-registration drive as part of her new 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about endorsements, but about how many people I can get to punch 
that hole beside my name," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donelon, who has stepped down from his council seat, said he also plans an 
aggressive campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be run fast and furious, much more organized than last time," said 
Donelon, who ran his last campaign from home but plans to open campaign 
headquarters in the district next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7th District Council seat will remain vacant until the February election. 
Mayor Beverly O'Neill is representing the district until then. However, O'Neill 
cannot vote on matters before the City Council because the mayor has no vote 
under the City Charter, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the 7th District office at 2125 Santa Fe Ave. remains open for 
constituents Tuesday mornings and Thursday afternoons, said Jeanne Wagner, the 
district chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just going about our duties as we always have," said Wagner, who has 
been assigned temporarily to O'Neill's staff as a special assistant. DUKE

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LYNWOOD; 3 COUNCIL MEMBERS TARGET OF RECALL DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Activists are circulating petitions to recall three of the five City Council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall documents accuse the three officials -- Mayor Paul H. Richards II, 
Mayor Pro Tem Louis Byrd and Councilman Louis J. Heine -- of raising water 
rates unnecessarily and mismanaging public money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're tired of the total disrespect for the community and for the taxpayers," 
said Benjamin Miranda, executive director of the group Concerned Citizens of 
Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd denied mismanaging public funds and accused the recall proponents of 
misleading the public by failing to note on the petitions that the water rate 
increase was postponed. He said the recall was nothing more than an attempt by 
Miranda and his allies to get their own people elected to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda and another organizer, Ada Candelario McZeal, have run for the council 
in the past, but were defeated.  
</P>
<P>
 The three council members voted in August for a 75% hike in water rates, 
arguing that the fees had remained unchanged for seven years and that the price 
of purchased water had doubled. But after residents complained, the council 
decided to postpone the increase indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda said recall organizers have gathered about 1,200 signatures of 
registered voters. They have until Jan. 4 to gather at least 2,565 valid 
signatures to force what would be Lynwood's first recall election. JOHN D.

CRACKDOWN IRRITATES ROSECRANS MERCHANTS; SAFETY: COMPTON TARGETS HAZARDS SUCH 
AS HIGH FENCES, RAZOR WIRE AND STORAGE AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Monday morning blues were a little worse this week for dozens of 
businesses along Rosecrans Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton city crews descended on a nine-block stretch of the avenue at 5 a.m. 
to tear down wrought-iron fences, chop down razor wire, clean up outside 
storage areas and correct other violations of city safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials described the sweep as emergency action, taken in the interest 
of public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, all these high fences and outdoor storage constituted a hazard 
where emergency personnel couldn't get through," said Paul H. Richards II, 
assistant city manager. "We had to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosecrans Avenue, one of the most heavily traveled corridors in town, is known 
for its proliferation of small food stands, markets, auto repair yards and 
other mom-and-pop stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said many of those businesses used fenced-in areas as outdoor 
storage, allowed trash to accumulate or failed to keep their properties in good 
repair. Some businesses also have erected fortified fences that exceed the 
city's 6-foot height limit. Free-standing signs and banners also violate city 
ordinances. Officials said city workers went door-to-door last Thursday to warn 
businesses of the massive effort to correct violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some business owners in the area called it a racist move by the city's black 
leaders against the area's businesses, most of which are run by Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a kind of harassment, I really believe that," said Pedro Pallan, who 
owns a bakery on Rosecrans and is president of the new Latinos United Coalition 
of Compton. "Why are they picking on this area? Why not target a predominantly 
black area?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pallan was cited for improperly storing material outside the bakery and for 
installing strands of razor wire to protect his roof from vandals. He cleaned 
up the storage area before Monday. City workers removed the razor wire during 
the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards called the racism charges outrageous. "This is a multicultural 
district. We have all kinds of businesses here." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of storefronts bear Spanish-language names or markers, but 
business owners of several races operate along Rosecrans, officials said. Of 
the two carwash businesses that lost their fences in the Monday sweep, one has 
a black owner and the other a Latino owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they started with the commercial stretch on Rosecrans between 
Wilmington Avenue and Alameda Street because it has some of the worst eyesores. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to start somewhere," Richards said. Similar crackdowns are likely on 
commercial stretches along Compton and Long Beach boulevards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they have been frustrated because businesses and residents 
have not taken cleanup ordinances seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area was just long overdue," said Councilman Ronald J. Green, whose 1st 
District includes the Rosecrans stretch. "Everyone has known this was going to 
happen for a long time. At some point, they need to learn to take us 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens complain that the city looks like a war zone, but those same citizens 
violate city codes by putting up fences over 6 feet high and topping them with 
razor wire, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 On the city's major boulevards, a few developers have erected mini-malls with 
carefully tended landscaping and private security guards of the type common in 
many cities. But on most streets, businesses of all different shapes, sizes and 
colors are crammed into commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to create more uniformity, the City Council passed an ordinance 
last year that requires businesses along major thoroughfares to use certain 
paint colors and facade styles. 
</P>
<P>
 The city provides special grants and loans to help finance the changes, but 
few businesses have applied, city officials pointed out. Some Latino business 
owners complained, however, that they were told only of the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 City crews also began applying beige paint this week to Rosecrans businesses 
that had featured such colors as green, blue and purple. The businesses were 
the first to be targeted for compliance with the ordinance requiring 
conformity, but code violations had to be cleared up as well, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problems went far deeper than just aesthetics," Richards said. "We had so 
many violations, it created an emergency that we needed to clean up." 
</P>
<P>
 All items taken from Rosecrans businesses were tagged and are being stored in 
the city yard.

USE A PARK, PAY A FEE; RECREATION: NON-RESIDENT GROUPS MUST NOW BUY A PERMIT IF 
THEY WANT TO USE CERTAIN PRIME AREAS OF CLAREMONT PARKS. DETRACTORS, WHO SAY 
THE POLICY IS AIMED AT MINORITIES IN NEARBY CITIES, CALL THE SYSTEM RACIST.

<P>
 Rejecting charges of racism, the Claremont City Council decided Tuesday to 
charge large groups and out-of-towners for reserving prime park spots to 
guarantee their access to them. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, the city has been crafting a policy to give Claremont residents 
primary access to the city's 15 parks after complaints from constituents that 
their parks were being overrun by large groups and outsiders. The majority of 
large groups using the picnic spots come from out of town, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents have labeled the action as "institutional racism," saying 
the largely white college town is trying to exclude people from the 
surrounding, mainly minority, communities. Claremont is 76.1% white; its 
southern neighbor, Pomona, is 71% minority, according to the 1990 U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee system requires any large group -- defined as 50 or more people -- 
that uses designated prime areas such as picnic tables to have a city permit or 
face ejection. Those without a permit will be given a warning until July, 1995. 
City residents must pay $35 for a permit; non-residents must pay $80. 
</P>
<P>
 For smaller gatherings, residents can reserve a spot at no charge; 
non-residents must pay $45. The smaller outside groups can use the space free 
if they don't reserve it, but must take the chance that it will be open. 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont is not the first to take such steps. Similar practices prevail at 
Arcadia's Wilderness Preserve and San Marino's Lacy Park; La Verne is 
considering such a policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a separatist action of institutional xenophobia," said Robert Herman, 
who lives next to Memorial Park. "We're going to go over to a group and say: 
'You can't be here. You have to go over to that part of the park.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's uncivilized. It's like saying to someone: 'Go and sit in the back of 
the bus. . . .' It's Jim Crow all over again with leave the good table for us." 
</P>
<P>
 But several council members said residents were paying for the parks through 
landscape and lighting assessments and increasingly were being kept from using 
them because more large groups from outside the city were using the most 
desirable spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard some anecdotes of small families from Claremont who've gone to a 
park and found outside people have taken over the park," Mayor Algird G. Leiga 
said. Leiga dismisses the charge of trying to keep minorities out as spurious 
and said the policy really concentrates on large groups. "If a large group 
comes from Beverly Hills, Arcadia or wherever, we are going to charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 67 large groups that the city knows used Claremont parks from May, 
1993, to May, 1994, 51 were from out of town, according to the city Parks 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Cody said large areas of the parks will require no 
reservations and will be open to the public.

$7.2-MILLION VERDICT FAVORS ALTADENA PAIR; LAWSUIT: THE COUPLE, FORCED FROM 
THEIR HOME BY A 1990 FIRE, ARE AWARDED DAMAGES AFTER A JURY DETERMINES THAT 
THEIR INSURER, FIRE INSURANCE EXCHANGE, MISHANDLED THEIR CLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A dispute over $7,500 led to a $7.2-million jury verdict after an Altadena 
couple whose house burned sued one of California's largest insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles and Patricia Woods had filed suit in Pasadena Superior Court alleging 
that Fire Insurance Exchange, a firm owned by Farmers Insurance Co., bungled 
their house fire claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The errors and delays left them without a usable house for more than four 
years and also caused Mrs. Woods to be wrongly arrested on suspicion of 
defrauding an innkeeper, the couple said in their lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, both 51, were awarded the money Sept. 27 after a six-week trial. 
The jury found that they were owed $626,000 for expenses incurred since the 
fire and $6.6 million in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 But Farmers spokesman John Millen said the Los Angeles-based company, which 
has 1.4 million homeowner polices statewide, prides itself on customer service 
and believes it acted fairly with the Woodses. He declined to say whether the 
company would appeal.  
</P>
<P>
 Millen pointed out that in another lawsuit filed by the insurance company 
against Charles and Patricia Woods, the judge ruled that the couple had been 
overpaid $16,000 for the fire damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal tussle arose after a March 30, 1990, fire damaged the kitchen and 
attic of the couple's house in the 2900 block of McNally Street. The fire 
forced the couple to relocate, along with an adult son who lived with them, to 
the Embassy Suites Hotel in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusion over payment of a hotel bill led Arcadia police to arrest Mrs. Woods 
on May 23, 1990. Embassy Suites operators called police because the couple had 
moved to a hotel next door and Embassy Suites was still owed $1,001. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hotel had been slow to issue a bill, so the couple used insurance 
company money to buy food and pay the bill at the second hotel, said the 
Woodses' attorney, Mark Didak. The district attorney assigned to the case never 
filed criminal charges against Mrs. Woods, calling the matter a civil dispute, 
Didak said. In June, 1990, the insurance company paid the couple more than 
$55,000 for repairs. But because the insurance adjuster failed to discover 
asbestos in the roof and did not include later rain damage, the Woodses said 
the actual cost of repairs would come to $62,500. When the insurance company 
refused to pay more, the couple filed a lawsuit in March, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Embassy Suites, which was also previously listed in the couple's suit, settled 
its part in the lawsuit in June, 1994, by agreeing to pay the couple $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing dispute has meant the couple have been unable to fix their house 
and have lived in rented rooms since the fire, Didak said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people haven't had a house for 4 1/2 years," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for Fire Insurance Exchange argued in court that the company was 
not to blame for Mrs. Woods' arrest. The company never received a bill from 
Embassy Suites and had paid money directly to the family, who should have paid 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance company also said it was not at fault for failing to find the 
asbestos, which even the Woodses' own contractor missed, and blamed the couple 
for later rain damage, saying they failed to cover the hole in the roof from 
the fire.

GABRIELINO FRESHMEN IN A CLASS BY THEMSELVES; EDUCATION: TEACHERS AND 
ADMINISTRATORS AT NEW HIGH SCHOOL ALSO WELCOME CHALLENGES. FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS 
START THEIR OWN TRADITIONS.

 When word got around Mark Keppel High School in Alhambra that social studies 
teacher Sharron Heinrich had applied for a new job, some of her colleagues 
called her a traitor and an opportunist. 
</P>
<P>
 Heinrich did not plan to leave Mark Keppel for just any school. She wanted to 
join forces with Alhambra's rival, the new Gabrielino High School in 
neighboring San Gabriel, which had broken away from the Alhambra district to 
open its own high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were saying, 'How could she do this? That school is never going to 
make it. I hope she'll be stuck there,' " Heinrich remembered. The school's 
chances for long-term survival were uncertain at best; San Gabriel had lost its 
first rounds on the issue in court. But Heinrich was determined to take the 
risk, for the chance to create a high school curriculum from the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
 Being the first ones in has its joys for students too. 
</P>
<P>
 This is perhaps the only high school where the freshmen are at the top of the 
heap -- because there are no upperclassmen. And after all, how often do 
freshmen become student government president and vice president, as Mae Castro 
and Gerome Guerrero already have done? That won't look too shabby on college 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 While younger students at established high schools might be too intimidated to 
get involved in school activities, Gabrielino's freshmen are the elected 
officials, lead thespians and team captains. 
</P>
<P>
 These students do not have to worry about feeling unnoticed or being teased by 
older students. "It's better this way because no one here picks on you," said 
Jessica Lieu, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Lopez, Gabrielino's football coach, said there were 45 students on the 
freshman team, while most schools have 30 to 35 players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the kids may not have made the cut at another school," he said. "But 
we've got enough coaches to have a big team." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The students play against other freshman football teams and have won two of 
four games so far. 
</P>
<P>
 It's high-school culture with a twist. The only band is beginning band and 
there is no marching band. The school yearbook will have no section on 
graduating seniors until 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that will all come with time," Principal Dan Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are no longstanding school jokes or annual traditions. If there are 
no upperclassmen to put the freshmen down, there also are no older students to 
serve as examples for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no tradition and no history," Lopez said. "They have to rely on our 
experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 There is, of course, no guarantee that Gabrielino will exist next year, let 
alone in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alhambra City and High School District has already won its first battle in 
Superior Court against the State Board of Education, which permitted San 
Gabriel to exclude Alhambra residents in their vote for a unified school 
district in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel had its own district for kindergarten through eighth grade, but 
sent its teen-agers to Alhambra for high school. Gabrielino was opened in 
September, pending the state board's appeal. The case is scheduled to be heard 
in appeals court this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabrielino's students and teachers, however, are not dwelling on the what ifs 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making history," said Michael Valdez, 14. "That feels good." 
</P>
<P>
 If Alhambra wins the board's appeal this spring and Gabrielino is closed, 
Heinrich said she will not regret her move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took a risk to be here and we may fall flat on our faces," she said. "But 
if we don't, it's all been worth it."

LONG BEACH TO EASE ADULT BUSINESS REINS; LAWS: NEW ZONING WOULD ALLOW TOPLESS 
CLUBS AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS TO OPERATE CLOSER TO HOMES, CHURCHES AND PARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A reluctant Long Beach City Council this week loosened its law regulating 
adult businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members tentatively approved a new zoning ordinance that will allow 
topless clubs and other racy establishments to operate closer to homes, 
churches and parks. Council members said they had little choice because recent 
court decisions have thrown the city's existing law into doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 In two separate lawsuits against the city, judges have said the original law 
may be unconstitutional because it fails to provide enough suitable commercial 
areas for adult businesses. Among the locations now earmarked for adult 
entertainment are Long Beach airport, oil fields and the city's port. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar law in Los Angeles was struck down last year by a federal appeals 
court, which ruled that it failed to offer enough viable alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned Long Beach residents have flooded council offices with calls in 
recent weeks. But city officials said the new law will continue to maintain 
buffer zones between adult businesses and neighborhoods. "This is the best 
compromise that still protects schools, parks, churches and homes," Mayor 
Beverly O'Neill said after the council vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The council reduced the buffer area between adult businesses and churches from 
1,000 feet to 500 feet. The distance between adult establishments and 
residential areas was cut from 500 to 300 feet. The distance between adult 
establishments and parks dropped from 1,000 to 600 feet. By cutting the 
buffers, officials were able to free up additional commercial areas for adult 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes, which will come up for final approval next Tuesday, will take 
effect a month later. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also extended a moratorium on all permits for adult businesses, 
even though none are currently in the pipeline, until Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the new law was mixed among neighborhood associations and business 
groups in the city. Some residents said they understand the city's predicament, 
but others said they hoped officials would stand firm on the original law. 
</P>
<P>
 Some downtown businesses in particular were angry that a portion of their area 
was included in newly drawn adult-entertainment zones. The business owners and 
some downtown-area council members argued that downtown should have been 
protected against any adult businesses because of the city's 
multimillion-dollar revitalization effort there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to protect our investment," said Councilwoman Jenny Oropeza. "Pine 
Avenue is vulnerable to this type of business. We have invested millions in 
trying to clear up this area. Let us not undercut that investment." 
</P>
<P>
 Adult business owners and their lawyers, meanwhile, expressed concern over the 
new law, which would require the city's five adult bookstores to relocate 
within 18 months. In a lawsuit, the bookstores contend that the existing law 
has not provided enough viable locations to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to take a very close look at the new map and see what this extra 
space really means," said David Brown, an attorney representing the bookstores. 
"Is it space that really can be used or is it an illusion? 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, the city's lone topless club, Angels in West Long Beach, would 
have to stop offering topless entertainment or move, said Deputy City Atty. 
Heather Mahood. Angels is too close to a residential zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Vicary, owner of Angels, obtained a preliminary injunction in July that 
barred the city from stopping topless dancing at the club, but Mahood said the 
injunction would not be valid after the new law takes effect.

6 COMPTON SCHOOL OFFICIALS WERE IMPROPERLY DEMOTED, JUDGE FINDS; COURTS: RULING 
PROVIDES FOR REINSTATEMENT AND BACK PAY. IT COULD EXPOSE DISTRICT TO LEGAL 
ACTION FROM OTHERS.

<P>
 A Superior Court judge has ruled that a state-appointed administrator 
overseeing Compton public schools improperly demoted six district officials 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Diane Wayne ruled that the officials, including a personnel director and 
the public information officer, are entitled to return to their old jobs and 
receive back pay because the administrator failed to give them adequate 
notification. 
</P>
<P>
 George W. Shaeffer, an attorney for the managers, said the state administrator 
was required under state law to give the managers notice of their job changes 
by July 1. Instead, some managers were demoted a couple of weeks before school 
started in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Some managers said they felt they had been treated unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked and very hurt. . . . I was wronged," said Naomi Rainey, who was 
demoted from public information officer to a teaching position. Rainey, who 
worked 18 years in the district, resigned to take a teaching job in Long Beach 
public schools. Rainey said she has not decided whether to return to her former 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said they will decide by Nov. 3 whether to appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's attorney, Melanie E. Lomax, said officials are also 
trying to determine how much the ruling could cost. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to at least $50,000 in back pay, the decision could expose the 
district to legal action from other administrators who were reassigned last 
year but did not join in the lawsuit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the ruling was issued last week, three other demoted employees demanded 
their old jobs back, said state-appointed Administrator J. Jerome Harris. He 
said the ruling could stymie recovery efforts of the financially troubled 
Compton school system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unreasonable, considering the mandate the state was given by the 
Legislature," he said. "It could throw a monkey wrench into our efforts to get 
back into fiscal compliance." 
</P>
<P>
 The state took over the beleaguered district in July, 1993, and appointed 
Stanley G. Oswalt as an interim administrator to restore the district's 
financial health and improve academic programs. Oswalt, who demoted several 
employees, remained as administrator until Harris was appointed in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the demoted employees who filed suit have left the district. In 
addition to Rainey, they are Clarence W. Hampton, a former human resources 
director, and Versie G. Burns, a former assistant director of personnel 
services. Three others involved in the suit, Ursula Omeze, Maple Cornwell and 
Oliver Miller, still work in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton school officials had argued that Oswalt, as state administrator, had 
the authority to demote top-level employees. The district also contended that 
the personnel moves were among several emergency steps taken to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-teaching workers were laid off. Managers and teachers took pay cuts.  
</P>
<P>
 "The deficit was getting worse. . . . It's kind of like the triage (unit) in 
the hospital. You go into a place and treat the most serious part of the 
injury," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is considering pushing for state legislation that would allow a 
state-appointed administrator the latitude to reassign managers without facing 
a lawsuit, Lomax said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law appears to be very inconsistent," Lomax said. "Is the 
(administrator's) primary responsibility to make fiscal cuts or maintain the 
status quo? That's where the rubber meets the road."

POLICE WON'T ISSUE BILL FOR STUDENT SEARCH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Monterey Park officials have decided to tear up a $3,000 bill that they sent 
to Montebello Unified School District officials after city police were called 
to help search for a missing student, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Montebello school board members were upset that they received the bill to 
pay for police overtime during the Sept. 19 search."What are the police for?" 
board President Darrell H. Heacock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey Park officials could not be reached and city police declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. Darline Robles reported in a memo that city officials said they 
sent the bill because they felt the district should have responded more quickly 
when it learned that the child, a special-education student, was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were called after the mother of the 10-year-old girl notified Macy 
Intermediate School in Monterey Park that the student had failed to board a bus 
after school. The girl was found unharmed about 12 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials alerted Monterey Park police within half an hour after 
receiving the mother's call, said Glenn Shepard, the school district's business 
manager. "Our feeling is that we responded in force in a timely fashion," he 
said. JOHN COX

CERRITOS EXTENDS BAN ON ADULT-ORIENTED BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cerritos City Council has extended its ban on adult-business licenses for 
10 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's staff will use the time to develop a zoning ordinance regulating 
adult-oriented entertainment, said City Manager Art Gallucci."We are 
researching where we can put them and how we can control them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallucci said the ordinance will probably permit the establishments to operate 
in commercial districts away from churches, schools and residential 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "All five of us on the council do not want these businesses in Cerritos, but 
we cannot outlaw them," said Mayor Pro Tem Grace Hu. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal appeals court ruled in 1993 that cities must provide commercially 
suitable areas for adult businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 1, Cerritos first declared a 45-day moratorium after city officials 
noticed an increase in license inquiries from potential adult-business 
operators. JOHN CANALIS

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; AGENCY ALLOCATES FUNDS FOR AQUARIUM DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's Redevelopment Agency has allocated $2.3 million toward the design 
of a proposed aquarium that many officials view as the key to an ambitious 
downtown revitalization plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be used to pay architects and designers to develop plans for 
the aquarium and conduct a feasibility study, said Susan F. Shick, Long Beach's 
community development director.The agency's decision marks the first time the 
city has set aside funds for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific is expected to anchor the Queensway Bay 
Project, a waterfront development of stores, restaurants and entertainment 
spots, said Robert J. Paternoster, project director. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary designs and final cost estimates for the aquarium should be ready 
in spring, 1995, Paternoster said. The state's Coastal Commission is expected 
to review the Queensway Bay project in May. If the plan is approved, 
construction of the aquarium could begin in September, 1995, with an opening 
slated for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The $100-million aquarium is expected to be financed largely through bond 
sales, Paternoster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kajima International Inc., a Japan-based developer that built an $84-million 
aquarium in Tampa, Fla., is in charge of the project. Two firms -- Esherick 
Homsey Dodge and Davis, and Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum -- will serve as 
architects. They also worked on the Tampa aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston-based Joseph A. Wetzel Associates Inc., which has worked on aquariums 
in New Jersey and Texas, will design the exhibits. JOHN CANALIS

POLICE JAM COUNCIL IN JOBS IMPASSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Usually only one or two police officers come to the Arcadia City Council 
meetings on alternate Tuesdays, but in recent weeks they have been crowding in, 
thanks to an impasse between the city and police officer's association over 
contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Arcadia Police Relief Assn., which represents more than a third 
of department's 127 officers, have been working without a contract since the 
first of the month. Although officers are not taking to the picket lines, they 
and their families have packed the council chamber to spread the word about the 
labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, after months of contract talks, has unanimously opposed the 
police association's proposals calling for a workweek made up of three 12-hour 
days instead of the usual five-day, 40-hour week. The council also has rejected 
pay adjustments that would amount to a 1.5% pay increase. The association, 
which is also seeking payment for time spent on-call, has refused to change its 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (three-day week) would put more police officers on the streets during 
peak hours to provide better service to the public," police negotiator Bruce 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Association officials point to eight other cities, including Pasadena, that 
have adopted the new schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arcadia council members said they do not believe the community would 
benefit from the change in hours because officers would be more fatigued. 
</P>
<P>
 "This 3-12 schedule its not on the cards," veteran Councilman Dennis A. 
Lojeski said. "I and other council members are really concerned about the 
liability issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Lojeski said he does not want to let Arcadia be used for a legal test case 
challenging the judgment of an officer who worked the new schedule. "I don't 
want an officer with a high-powered weapon in his hand or a high-powered car 
under his foot in the 12th hour of his three-day shift," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members said any assessment of such a change should also be made 
by a new police chief. Chief Neil Johnson retires Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Bill Kelly said he and Johnson were willing to experiment with 
the 3-12 scheme but the council rejected it.  
</P>
<P>
 As to the benefits package worth 1.5%, council members said the demand comes 
at a time when the city simply cannot afford any increase for officers who are 
among the valley's most highly paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't the time for this kind of request," Lojeski said. "I am proud of 
the fact we've given a 25.3% increase to officers in the last three years."

TOPICS / EDUCATION; SCHOOL SEEKS A WAY OUT OF DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When word spread among teachers that an Altadena school was in debt and 
scheduled to close last spring, they turned to Iraj Broomand for help. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Broomand stepped in as executive director of Escalon, a nonprofit 
private school for children with learning and emotional disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Broomand declined to discuss how much debt Escalon was in, but said it was "a 
great deal." As school director, he is negotiating agreements with the 
creditors, which will then be presented to Atty. Gen. Daniel E. Lungren. If 
Lungren rejects the agreements, Escalon may still be closed, Broomand said. 
</P>
<P>
 Broomand revived a school with similar problems in 1986. Stirling Academy in 
Reseda had 17 students and was faced with financial debt and closure, but it 
has grown to 50 students under Broomand's direction. He continues as executive 
director of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Escalon has 60 students ages 8 to 18 who receive specialized attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a shame if Escalon closed," Broomand said. "Hopefully, we will 
not put a lot of kids on the streets."

TOPICS / LAW ENFORCEMENT; OFFICER, DEMOTED AFTER FATHERING A CHILD WITH 
COLLEAGUE, FILES BIAS CLAIM; PASADENA POLICE ARE ALSO INVESTIGATING WHETHER 
SGT. PAUL GALES FIXED A TRAFFIC TICKET FOR ANOTHER GIRLFRIEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Pasadena police lieutenant, demoted to the rank of sergeant after he 
fathered a child with a female officer, has filed a $5-million claim against 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter that police officials say is unrelated to the Sept. 2 demotion, 
the department is investigating the same man, Sgt. Paul Gales, for allegedly 
fixing a traffic ticket for another girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 In his claim, which also targets Police Chief Jerry Oliver and other top 
police officials, Gales, a 13-year veteran of the department, said that police 
investigators unfairly probed into his personal life, that Oliver and other 
supervisors unjustly accused Gales of lying about the number of times he had 
consensual sex with the unidentified female officer who became pregnant, and 
that police initiated the ticket-fixing investigation as a way of retaliating 
against Gales for objecting to the demotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here is a man who has given 13 years of public service as a police officer, 
and his career is being destroyed over something in his personal life that 
Jerry Oliver disagrees with," Gales' attorney, Joe C. Hopkins, said of the 
paternity investigation that brought on Gales' demotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver, who authorized the demotion, was not available for comment. Gales also 
could not be reached for comment.

<P>
 Hopkins said Gales has assumed financial responsibility for the child, who is 
now 8 months old. The mother, a lower-ranking officer, has not been disciplined 
in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 Gales also claims that police officials withheld pay increases and overtime 
pay and had threatened to fire Gales if he appealed his demotion from 
lieutenant to sergeant, a $13,000-a-year cut in pay. Gales said in his suit 
that police pried into his sex life and singled him out because he is African 
American. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Cmdr. Bob Huff, who is also a target of Gales' claim, said the female 
officer involved in the paternity investigation was not directly supervised by 
Gales and said there are no department rules prohibiting fraternization among 
officers. Because the investigation is not yet closed, and because it involves 
personnel issues, Huff refused to say what prompted Gales' demotion in the 
absence of such regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Huff said the ticket-fixing probe was started after police received an 
anonymous letter accusing Gales and another officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are looking into whether Gales used his influence as a police 
supervisor to have a traffic ticket issued to Dollicia Evans, Gales' 
girlfriend, dismissed, Huff said. Huff would not name the second officer or 
describe how the alleged ticket-fixing was supposedly carried out.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LA MIRADA; HOSPITAL TO REOPEN UNDER NEW OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new Dallas-based corporation has bought the Medical Center of La Mirada, 
which had been closed more than two years, and plans to reopen the facility by 
Feb. 1 to provide limited care. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will treat patients who require hospital stays of at least 25 days, 
and additional services such as outpatient surgery and emergency care may be 
offered in the future, said Ty L. Richardson, president of Specialty Hospitals 
of America Inc., the new owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important that the community has a place to go when there is an 
emergency," he said. Richardson acknowledged, however, that emergency care 
would be established only if it is found to be financially feasible.  
</P>
<P>
 The 145-bed hospital at 14900 E. Imperial Highway closed in May, 1992, when 
its owner, Medical Properties Inc. of Encino, reported heavy financial losses. 
Los Angeles-based FCC Holdings Ltd. foreclosed on the property Sept. 30 and 
sold it to Specialty on Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which will be renamed The Specialty Hospital of Southern 
California, is the Dallas company's first acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the center's closure, those in need of immediate hospitalization or 
serious emergency care have had to travel to hospitals in Whittier, Downey, 
Buena Park and other nearby cities. JOHN CANALIS

 Monterey Park officials have decided to tear up a $3,000 bill that they sent 
to Montebello Unified School District officials after city police were called 
to help search for a missing student, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Montebello Unified school board members were upset that they received the 
bill to pay for police overtime during the Sept. 19 search. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey Park officials could not be reached and city police declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. Darline Robles reported in a memo that city officials said they 
sent the bill because they felt the district should have responded more quickly 
when it learned that the child, a special-education student, was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were called after the mother of the 10-year-old girl notified Macy 
Intermediate School in Monterey Park that the student had failed to board a bus 
after school. The girl was found unharmed about 12 hours later. JOHN COX

LA PUENTE COUNCILMAN CHARGED WITH DRUNK DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA O'NEILL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A La Puente councilman was arrested Sunday night on suspicion of drunk driving 
after he allegedly hit two cars in the parking lot of a City of Industry bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles H. Storing, a 29-year veteran of the La Puente City Council, was 
arrested at 9:45 p.m. as he was leaving the Playboy Lounge, Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Lt. Bob Binkley said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he was attempting to leave the parking lot, Storing allegedly backed his 
gray 1985 four-door Ford into a parked car then drove forward and hit a second 
car. The second vehicle was then pushed into a third, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage was estimated at $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy patrolling the parking lot approached 
Storing and administered a field sobriety test, which Storing failed, Binkley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Storing chose to give a urine sample; the results will not be available for 
two weeks. Storing was cited for misdemeanor driving under the influence and 
was released at about 4:30 Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Williams, owner of the Playboy Lounge, who was working Sunday night, said 
Storing only had one glass of wine there and was in the bar for about 15 
minutes. But after serving Storing the wine, "we wouldn't serve him any more," 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said that Storing appeared intoxicated but was well-behaved. Storing 
then got something to eat and left soon after, Williams said. Storing has been 
coming to the Playboy Lounge about twice a month for eight years, Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Storing did not return telephone calls made to his home and office by The 
Times.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; STUDENTS GET TRAINING FOR TOMORROW'S WORLD; 
LIKE ITS NAMESAKE, JACKIE ROBINSON ACADEMY IS A TRAILBLAZER; LANGUAGES, 
COMPUTERS ARE STRESSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jim Morin stands in front of a hazy chalkboard filled with scribbling as he 
surveys two lines of blue-and-white-clad fifth- and sixth-graders entering his 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh air wafts through an open doorway as the students burst into the 
sparsely decorated room, filling it with chatter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kiritsu!" he says with voice raised, demanding their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kyotsuke!" he commands. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, accustomed to daily ritual, quickly come to order. Then bowing, 
they greet their instructor with a "good morning." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohayo gozaimasu, " they say in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, students in other classes break into choruses of "buenos dias" or 
"bonjour. " 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Jackie Robinson Academy, the Long Beach School District's newest 
and arguably most radical school. Younger students spend up to 90% of their 
school day immersed in a language -- French, Japanese or Spanish. Students in 
the upper grades receive up to half their instruction in a foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of planning, the academy opened its doors last month to 572 
students from pre-kindergarten to sixth grade. Another 425 students were turned 
away, an indication that the academy is one of the district's most popular 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 And for ample reason. 
</P>
<P>
 The language immersion program is one of several efforts to help prepare 
students for a diverse, global, high-tech society. Officials said they selected 
French, Japanese and Spanish because those languages are used often in 
international business. 
</P>
<P>
 Each class has access to sophisticated computer systems to allow students to 
communicate and share assignments with children throughout the state and the 
country, as well as allowing them access to data around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is the only school in the district that takes the Montessori approach, 
a private school technique in which children are grouped together by ability 
rather than age and encouraged to progress at their own pace. Some classes have 
children three years apart in age. Instructors say grouping children in this 
fashion encourages independence and fosters self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 At the school, children with physical or learning disabilities, rather than 
being placed in classes by themselves, are included in general classes and 
offered the same learning environment as other students. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators have created an ethnically balanced student body that mirrors 
the racial and ethnic composition of the city. White students make up 23% of 
the enrollment; blacks, 27%; Latinos, 32%; Asians, 5%; Filipinos, 9%, and other 
groups, such as Native Americans and Pacific Islanders, 4%. The school received 
a $550,000 federal grant awarded to districts to help desegregation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 By emphasizing a diverse enrollment, foreign languages and computer 
technology, "we're trying to start off early to give students skills they need 
to participate in the 21st Century," said area Supt. Dorothy Harper. "It's a 
new way of teaching and a new way of learning." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's only requirement for admission is that parents get involved in 
school activities. Before their children could be considered for enrollment, 
parents had to agree to devote at least 20 hours for the school year to 
school-related activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The requirement proved no obstacle as parents throughout the district 
scrambled to sign up their children for the new $7.6-million school on Pine 
Avenue across from Veterans Memorial Park on the west side of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Dilcia Francis said she signed up her two sons and drives them to and 
from school each day. Francis, a native of Honduras, said she wants her sons, 
Hiram and Zahir, to become fluent in Spanish. "I want them to have the language 
skills," Francis said. "It will keep them in touch with their roots." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the first week, administrators and teachers encountered some rough 
spots as they labored to launch Robinson's ambitious academic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In some classes, students initially resisted teachers' efforts to immerse them 
in a foreign language, repeatedly asking instructors to speak in English. In 
most cases, teachers work with the children if they become frustrated by 
rephrasing what was said or by asking a bilingual student to assist in 
translating for their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were delays in introducing certain subjects as some teachers took 
extra time to plan lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is new for all of us," said Morin, who is teaching for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his lack of teaching experience, Morin was hired because he is fluent 
in Japanese. He learned the language during a two-year stay there as a 
missionary. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's teachers are relatively inexperienced -- administrators placed a 
premium on recruiting teachers with strong bilingual skills, said Principal 
Erlinda Teisinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 22 teachers, seven are teaching for the first time. Many are taking 
classes themselves to improve their teaching and bilingual skills. This is not 
particularly unusual since there is a shortage of qualified bilingual 
educators, Teisinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morin, who decided to switch to teaching after eight years as an accountant in 
the district, is going to night school to earn a teaching credential and 
certification as a bilingual teacher.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he decided to leave his accounting position -- taking a pay cut -- "to 
be involved in something more personally satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Teisinger, who is fluent in four languages, was hired in February from Fresno, 
where she earned accolades for developing innovative high-tech and science 
programs at Balderas Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fresno school, which she opened in 1990, has been recognized by the U.S. 
Department of Education as one of the country's 200 most innovative schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw my kids operating on cow's eyes, experimenting with plants in botany 
class and doing other hands-on science projects," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach officials say Teisinger has been the driving force behind the 
academy's emphasis on high-tech and computers. Recently she sent out a plea for 
more computers through the school district's newsletter. The school received a 
total of 90 computers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to pushing for a greater emphasis on teaching computer and other 
technological skills, Teisinger has been recruiting private industry and higher 
education institutions to get involved with programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring Pacific Hospital of Long Beach has agreed to present health 
lessons, and Cal State Long Beach is training the school's bilingual teachers. 
Hughes Aircraft Co. is donating a satellite dish and fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
 But the foreign language immersion classes are the centerpiece of the school's 
program.  
</P>
<P>
 Teisinger, who has taught language immersion classes, credits bilingual 
programs for her fluency in Spanish, Tagalog and Ilocano, a Filipino dialect.  
</P>
<P>
 Maria Quezada, a language specialist who provides training for Jackie Robinson 
Academy's bilingual teachers, says bilingual immersion programs help students' 
overall academic performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids really become attuned to language so they become more analytic of 
English," said Quezada, director of the Multifunctional Resource Center at Cal 
State Long Beach. "These skills transfer from one language to another. And 
English is not lost. English is enhanced." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, studies indicate that English-speaking students in bilingual programs 
gain an academic edge over their traditionally educated peers, said David 
Ramirez, executive director for the Center for Language Minority Education and 
Research at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They end up scoring higher on (IQ tests) compared to their peers," said 
Ramirez, who conducted a national study of the impact of bilingual programs on 
learning. "They seem to exhibit higher thinking skills, greater flexibility 
with new situations and challenges. They are just brighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez helped develop and design Robinson's foreign language program. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Morin speaks enthusiastically about preliminary plans for a 
three-year economics curriculum that he intends to teach in Japanese and 
English to the academy's older students. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Morin's fifth- and sixth-graders have been getting 10% of their 
instruction in Japanese, an equivalent of about 45 minutes a day, he says. Most 
of the instruction consists of familiarizing the students with the Japanese 
alphabet and numbers, as well as simple commands and greetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really all we've got time for. At least the first half of the year," 
he said. "When they get more comfortable with numbers, I will start integrating 
the financial curriculum with that."  
</P>
<P>
 In his sparely decorated room, accented by a handful of fern-like plants and a 
plastic map of Japan, Morin describes his plans to teach the school's 
sixth-graders about the value of money. He hopes to introduce a "Jackie 
Robinson dollar" (a currency equivalent to the U.S. dollar) that can be used to 
exchange goods and services at student-run "businesses." With the aid of 
computer programs, students will manage personal budgets. Students will also 
learn about international currency systems such as the yen or the franc, as 
well as rates of exchange, Morin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's something for the future. On this Tuesday morning, it was time for 
some of his students to head out to the school's field for a firsthand lesson 
-- in English -- about the physics of hot-air balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 A kaleidoscope of colors -- mauve, purple, gray, green, yellow, orange and red 
-- were splashed across a nylon canvas that rose gradually as an operator fired 
up burners to inflate the balloon. Students took pictures of the colorful blob 
as it slowly expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 children -- five from Morin's class -- took turns riding in the 
wicker basket, the gondola, which took off several feet from the ground as 
burners heated air inside the balloon. Afterward, the children gushed about 
their science lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven-year-old Nubia Torres exclaimed: "This is fun. We learn by doing, not 
by reading books. It's exciting."

the cost for this year's Rose Parade float from Arcadia, which will depict 
horse racing at the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia officials said they immediately thought of the park when they learned 
that the Tournament of the Roses parade theme this year was going to be "Sports 
-- A Quest for Excellence." 
</P>
<P>
 Racing enthusiasts have gathered for 60 years at the Arcadia track. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have had any float design we wanted," said Joyce Macartney, 
secretary of Arcadia's Tournament of Roses. "But being that it's a sports theme 
and being that the racetrack is in Arcadia, it seemed like the perfect idea." 
</P>
<P>
 The float will show five horses running down the Camino Real hillside turf 
course. Other sponsors include the Oak Tree Racing Assn., which conducts the 
fall racing season at Santa Anita, and the Arcadia Tournament of Roses Assn., 
which holds fund-raisers to build the city's annual floats. This is Arcadia's 
30th year in the Pasadena parade, which will be held Jan. 2.

PERCEIVED RACIAL BIAS SPARKS WALKOUT BY POMONA STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A small number of Pomona Unified high school students walked out of school on 
Monday in protest of what they perceived were three signs of racial prejudice 
in the school district. But district officials said the teen-agers should have 
done their homework; they were wrong on all three counts. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 of the district's 5,500 high school students marched in opposition 
to what they said was the district's support of Proposition 187 and its 
celebration of Columbus Day. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the district formally opposed Prop. 187 last month, and officials 
said the district has never celebrated Columbus Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The students apparently took the word of 19-year-old Pomona High School 
graduate Ricky Sierra, who admitted that he sneaked into Ganesha, Garey and 
Pomona high schools on Friday to distribute hundreds of flyers promoting the 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Sierra's lead, the students said they also were angry that Latino 
applicants were not being considered for superintendent, when, in fact, a 
Latino is among the final candidates for the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is what they're upset about," said Cassandra A. George, assistant 
superintendent of secondary schools, "then I'm very confused." 
</P>
<P>
 To support the protest, Ganesha and Pomona students walked out of school at 
noon, while Garey students had the day off for a teachers' conference. 
</P>
<P>
 They congregated in front of City Hall, where many students held Mexican flags 
and signs that read, "Death to Pepe Wilson," "No Apartheid in the USA" and 
"Vive la Raza." 
</P>
<P>
 Others sat in the shade, sipped sodas and chatted with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 After 20 minutes, Sierra directed the teen-agers to the district building 
across the street, where he and other speakers used derogatory terms for whites 
and homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they will discipline those students who left school 
illegally. "Student activism is a legitimate way in a democracy for people to 
express their feelings and opinions," George said. "But I think it's 
reprehensible when adults use children for their own political agendas." 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra said he knew the students would be punished for cutting school, but 
said, "You've got to take risks."

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; 3 CHURCH GROUPS URGE DEFEAT OF PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three coalitions of Pasadena-area churches are calling for the defeat of 
Proposition 187, which would deny most public services to illegal immigrants if 
approved Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ecumenical Council of Pasadena Area Churches, which represents 38 
congregations of different denominations; the Interdenominational Ministerial 
Alliance of Greater Pasadena, comprising 32 mostly African American 
congregations, and Altadena Congregations Together Serving, representing nine 
interfaith religious bodies, said they oppose the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the groups said "the most vulnerable children will be victims of 
Proposition 187," which would bar the children of illegal immigrants from 
attending public school. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups called Proposition 187 "one of the clearest moral issues to 
confront California voters in many years."

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; SUIT ALLEGES POLICE USED EXCESSIVE FORCE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A civil lawsuit filed by an African American man who was arrested during a 
racially charged melee between Pasadena police and members of his family, who 
are prominent in sports and community affairs, is scheduled to go to trial 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Aug. 17, 1991, incident at Brookside Park, Gordon McCullough, 40, 
was charged with battery on a police officer and resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough was later found innocent of battery, but guilty of resisting 
arrest. He was sentenced to probation and ordered to attend counseling. He is 
suing the city and police on the grounds of assault and use of excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sprayed 11 others, many of them members of McCullough's family, with 
tear gas. The other family members also filed lawsuits against the city, said 
Assistant City Atty. Lawrence Newberry. However, Newberry said the others 
accepted cash settlements for undisclosed amounts and their cases never went to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Newberry said a settlement offer has not been made to McCullough, primarily 
because a jury had found him guilty of resisting arrest.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; PHILANTHROPIST, CAR DEALER JACK WALL DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prominent civic leader and philanthropist Jack H. Wall, a Chevrolet dealer in 
Pasadena for more than 30 years, died of cancer at his home last week. He was 
64. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall pioneered the concept of building over the county-owned wash to expand 
usable land on the site of his agency, now Team Chevrolet. Other cities, 
including Glendale, have since undertaken similar development projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Active in civic affairs, Wall also led a political action committee that 
lobbied for passage of California's "lemon law" to provide some protection to 
car buyers who bought cars that had repeated mechanical problems. His antique 
car collection was often made available to the community for fund-raising 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall is survived by his wife of 38 years, Helen, and his sons John, Jim and 
Peter. 
</P>
<P>
 A new maternity wing at Huntington Memorial Hospital will be named in honor of 
Helen and Jack Wall in recognition of their recent $1-million gift to the 
hospital's replacement campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Services were held Monday at Holy Family Catholic Church in South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The family requests that any remembrances be made in Wall's name to Huntington 
Memorial Hospital, 100 W. California Blvd., Pasadena, Calif. 91105, in care of 
the Development Office.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CLAREMONT; WARMTH BY THE YARD IN AFGHANS FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At this year's Los Angeles County Fair, volunteers for a Claremont church 
group collected 3,000 knitted or crocheted squares that will be used to make 
afghans for local homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 Our Lady of the Assumption volunteers worked on piecing together the afghans 
at tables in the fair's Home Arts Building, where many fair-goers stopped by to 
bring donated squares or pick up donated yarn to make the squares. 
</P>
<P>
 The group collected more than twice as many squares this year as it did at the 
1993 fair. The afghans are part of a project coordinated by the Archdiocesan 
Council of Catholic Women of Los Angeles. Most of the volunteers are senior 
citizens who work on the squares at home or in church.

TOLERANCE: COVERAGE OF RELIGION DEEMED FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to personally thank you for the article titled "Soul Searching" 
(Aug. 4).Tommy Li and the other contributing reporters, Mathis Chazanov and 
Diane Seo, did their homework and presented the story from a professional, 
factual point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 The story was not preachy, as religious articles can be. There are differences 
in religion and beliefs. Understanding those differences breaks down barriers 
in society by allowing us to not just tolerate each other but understand each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Los Angeles Times subscriber, I look forward to additional quality 
articles like this.

LIBRARY: A NEED FOR HARMONY, NOT RANCOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As usual, the battles in Monterey Park escalate into full-blown wars (Sept. 
15) with the help of headline-seeking media and the various associations from 
outside the community that are poised to cry racism for any reason, justified 
or not. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest war involving Library Board President Kathleen Brzozowski is much 
ado about nothing.It would never have gone anywhere if people weren't looking 
for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 As a volunteer in our community, I had occasion to work with the former 
librarian. Although she appeared to be a nice person, I can't say I was 
impressed with her managerial acumen or her ability to follow up. The fact that 
she resigned, had her contract bought out, and that library board members were 
told by attorneys not to discuss the situation, is not unusual in the public or 
private workplace. Yet Marina Tse broke that trust and I believe was deservedly 
criticized by Board President Brzozowski. 
</P>
<P>
 This entire episode makes Mayor Judy Chu's celebration of Harmony Month in 
Monterey Park both farcical and hollow. I believe the two combatants should be 
put in a room to iron out their differences. Send the activists from Cerritos, 
El Monte and elsewhere back to their forts and let's get on with the business 
of running our library.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; LIVE & LEARN; AT CAL POLY POMONA, 20 STUDENTS 
RESIDE IN A COMMUNAL CENTER THAT STRESSES RECYCLING AND SELF-SUFFICIENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dinner with "the hippies on the hill" is no piece of steak. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Sara Trifiro's turn as resident chef at Cal Poly Pomona's Center for 
Regenerative Studies, where 20 students live, work and study with solar power, 
recycled waste water and organic crops -- a postmodern Biosphere II. 
</P>
<P>
 On a secluded campus hilltop, Trifiro, 28, is madly chopping bell peppers from 
the garden for the organic eggplant-tomato casserole, to the funky beat of a 
Rested Root tape. Other students set the patio tables without landfill-clogging 
paper napkins -- they prefer hand towels from the kitchen. After dinner, a 
tired Trifiro and crew wash the dishes in solar-heated water and dump the 
dishwater on the compost heap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything takes so much work here," groaned Trifiro, a graduate student in 
landscape architecture. "It just brings home the point that everything you do, 
everything you buy, every place you go and how you get there . . . you start 
thinking about it. We're trying to set an example here." 
</P>
<P>
 As the center's first anniversary approaches, students say they are forgetting 
their old, wasteful ways of eating fast-food hamburgers from plastic-foam boxes 
or running the dryer for just one towel. Now, they use homemade solar barbecues 
built of foil, electric tape and cardboard boxes. They joke about their "solar 
clothes dryer" -- a clothesline strung across a window. They throw pumpkin 
seeds into the steaming compost heap to see how fertile their organic waste is; 
sure enough, a fat pumpkin grows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're learning about living," said Diana Jerkins, 45, the center's new 
director, an agriculture expert from the University of Georgia. She lives there 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly faculty members designed the 16-acre center to promote regenerative 
studies, the use and reuse of natural resources without damaging the 
environment. A Cal Poly landscape architecture professor had conceived the 
center in 1976 as a project for his graduate students, challenging them to come 
up with ideas on a new, ecologically sound lifestyle. Major foundations 
embraced the concept and kicked in funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The $10-million complex, which is funded entirely by grants and donations, is 
the only one of its kind on a college campus, a throwback to the days of '60s 
communal living but with '90s technology. Within the next few years, plans call 
for 90 people to live in a mostly self-sustaining environment, similar to the 
now-defunct Biosphere II in Oracle, Ariz., except that Cal Poly's complex is 
open. Next month, construction starts on the center's Phase II, a 
3,240-square-foot addition with classrooms, offices and seminar rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The center opened last Thanksgiving weekend with 10 students but without 
full-time staff or organized operations. On Nov. 9, Cal Poly officials will 
dedicate the center as part of Founder's Day, a ceremony to mark the 1949 
donation of land that got the university started. Meanwhile, visitors tour the 
center every day, including researchers from Hungary, Africa and India. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the center looked unfinished, situated on barren land that was 
home to owls, hawks, snakes and tarantulas. There wasn't much there besides 
four solar-paneled buildings made of cedar from an old Louisiana barn. There 
were no trees, flowers or plants. No fish in the six ponds. No recycling 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first year was spent philosophizing on our ethics, getting to know each 
other, figuring out exactly what we wanted to do here and what our goals were," 
said senior Nichole Sirbike, a 22-year-old animal science major. "This year, 
we're really just doing all the work we talked about last year. It's really 
exciting to see things actually get done because we talked about things for so 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, grapevines wind around trellises in front of the buildings; in the 
summer, the leaves provide shade and in winter they fall off and let sunlight 
in. Around the center, students planted pomegranate trees, fig trees, morning 
glories, zinnias and other plants. In rooftop planter boxes, they're growing 
mint, savory and sage. Near the fishponds, which are teeming with tilapia, 
basil and lemongrass grow in planters made from old tires. Terraces on the 
hillside are shored up with broken concrete. And students have adopted four 
cats and a dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's feeling like home," said Steve Nawrath, 28, the resident manager since 
the center opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Some outsiders call them hippies, weirdos, guinea pigs or worse; residents 
jokingly describe the center as "cheap rent with a statement." 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw this as a place to start out these new ideas so people can learn from 
us here," said senior Liza Pugeda, 22, who could have graduated in June but 
chose to continue classes so she could live at the center. "It really is a 
family. . . . I've never had friends like I have friends here." 
</P>
<P>
 Students rotate chores, such as cooking, grocery shopping and gardening. Rent 
is $225 a month, the same as the dormitory rates, and students each chip in $60 
a month for food. For breakfast and lunch, residents grab whatever is in the 
refrigerator, and for dinner, they eat together. Each resident must pursue an 
academic minor in regenerative studies while juggling other classes. They are 
required to work at the center six hours a week -- three hours of chores and 
three hours as part of their classroom studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all here for one thing," said Trifiro, the sometime-chef. "We're all 
bonded by the cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Life takes time here -- and thought. Cars are frowned upon, so students make 
an effort to walk or ride bikes up and down the center's steep, winding 
driveway, a half-mile trek. Say you want to clean your car trunk. You trundle a 
cart to your car, outside the center's gates. You load the cart, push it to the 
recycling bins and sort the trash: the organic waste in one pile, aluminum cans 
in another, tins and metal in another, one kind of plastic here, another kind 
of plastic there, the newspapers here, the white paper there. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't even think about bringing home groceries in plastic bags -- not when the 
center has its own collection of cloth sacks. And make sure to check labels for 
recyclable packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody polices each other, to the point of obsession, said junior Raisa 
Hussain, a 22-year-old civil engineering major. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh God, if I ate a Cup o'Noodles over here, you know how many people would 
come tell me, 'Well, that has monosodium glutamate in it, and it's (plastic 
foam), which you can't even recycle because it takes too much energy, and the 
plastic wrapping and the glossy wrapper . . ." Hussain said, with exhaustion. 
"It's like, geez, let me eat. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 At her family's home in San Dimas, Hussain said, she feels guilty flushing the 
toilet -- that's five gallons down the drain, whereas the center's low-flush 
toilets use 1.5 gallons. She feels so guilty that she tries to avoid drinking 
water when she's there. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center, over candlelight dinners, the students endlessly examine their 
ethics. Is it OK to plant non-edible flowers, just for looks and clippings? And 
how much is too much? Do they want to eat the chickens arriving later this 
month, or just eat the eggs? Even at a birthday party, someone spotted toy 
party sunglasses, frowned and said: "Oh great. Plastic waste." 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions are inevitable, students say. On the refrigerator, someone has posted 
an anonymous plea that reminds residents to clean up after themselves and close 
packages tightly. Food disappears so quickly that no one is shy about taking 
the last tofu wiener. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the year, the residents plan to be growing much of their own 
food, including grains, oats and corn. Students have yet to cook fish from 
their ponds; tests have shown that the fish have a high lead content, possibly 
from the pellets they are being fed. This quarter, students will decide whether 
to raise livestock such as cows and goats to produce milk, keep the grass mowed 
and provide manure for fertilizer. Many residents, some of them vegetarians, 
oppose eating the animals, a subject still under debate. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only part of the solar-energy system is working. In each building, 
solar panels heat only the water. Within the next few years, plans call for the 
center to generate all of its own electricity through solar energy, windmills 
and water turbines. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents think about their own future and how their lives will change when 
they leave the center. Eventually, Hussain said, she'd like to build her own 
regenerative house, perhaps of straw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living like this is a (key) for our survival," she said. "If you go back to 
basics, the answers are simple, the solutions are easy, and everyone can do 
them." Life With the 'Regens' 
</P>
<P>
 It's been dubbed "Biosphere without a lid" because Cal Poly Pomona's Center 
for Regenerative Studies is so hard to explain.

THEATER REVIEW; REAL-LIFE EVENTS IN IRAQ FAIL TO SPOIL A JOLLY 'KISMET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 En route to the San Gabriel Civic Auditorium to see the Music Theatre of 
Southern California's production of "Kismet," we heard that Baghdad-based 
Saddam Hussein was sending more of his troops closer to the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the theater, we heard the chorus singing the jolly strains of "Not 
Since Nineveh" ("Baghdad, this irresistible town!"). "Kismet" was always 
kitschy, but in the post-Gulf War era, it has become downright surreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, director Bill Shaw and crew had no idea of Saddam's intentions, but 
while watching this "Kismet," it's fun to imagine what the folks backstage were 
thinking as news from the real world started intruding on their confectionary 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisely, Shaw refuses to insert any timely jokes into the already complex book 
by Charles Lederer and Luther Davis. Zale Kessler as the funny, evil Wazir 
uncannily resembles Saddam, but that's the only hint of modernity to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be found is some very strong singing, especially by Bob Lauder, as 
Jr.'s Poet, the show's lucky hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauder has a wealth of opportunities to show off his voice in this alternately 
gorgeous and hammy score, adapted by Robert Wright and George Forrest from 
Alexander Borodin's opera, "Prince Igor." Indeed, Lauder has virtual arias, and 
Act II's four-voice "And This Is My Beloved" (which includes Lauder, Kessler, 
and Ann Winkowski and Ivan Rutherford as the lovers) is Verdi-like in its 
passions and excess. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the score and book are pure excess. In fact, the musical was a '50s 
creation of the L.A. Civic Light Opera, and the show biz pull is obvious, 
especially in the bump-and-grind dance numbers. Choreographer Rikki Lugo can do 
very little to escape from the musical's built-in terpsichorean tastelessness 
(care of Jack Cole), just as Shaw can do little to update the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Shaw or somebody with the San Gabriel-based company should have 
returned the set to its sender, the Tri Cities Opera Co. The best view of this 
show is in the back of the house, where it looks and sounds charming; closer 
in, the design's tackiness becomes overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 Consistently well spoken and smartly tongue-in-cheek, none of the leads takes 
anything seriously here except for the music, which alone is a good reason for 
local theater companies to revive "Kismet" -- despite the harsh news from the 
real world. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Kismet," San Gabriel Civic Auditorium, 320 S. Mission Blvd., San Gabriel. 
Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays and Saturday, Oct. 22, 2 p.m. through 
Oct. 23. Tickets: $20 to $40. (800) 474-2484 or (213) 480-3232.

FOR PARENTS / FAMILY OUTING; TRAILS OFFER A SAFE PLACE TO PEDAL; EXPERTS ALSO 
ADVISE BIKE RIDERS TO STAY AWAY FROM TRAFFIC, MAKE SURE CHILDREN UNDERSTAND 
RULES OF THE ROAD AND ENSURE THAT EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY THOSE UNDER 18, WEARS A 
HELMET.

<P>
 It's a lonely spot where the San Gabriel River Bike Trail begins, near where 
Azusa Avenue becomes San Gabriel Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The hills rise high above the trail and scrub brush abounds. But the secluded 
trail can be a perfect spot, especially for parents who want to ride their 
10-speeds while the kids roll along beside them. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, bicyclists can buy permits across the road at a National Forest 
Service building, park their cars on the roadside and pedal off. The trail is 
marked by a small yellow sign rising above the weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a safe and scenic trail is just one bit of advice for prospective 
bicyclists, however. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, all riders should "stay away from traffic," said Brian Arnett, 
manager of Covina Schwinn. "Most of the streets in the (Covina) area are wide 
enough for traffic and bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "And also make sure your children understand traffic laws," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just because children are riding two-wheelers doesn't mean they're up to 
keeping pace with an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 "With kids, it's helpful if they're old enough to ride a bike with multiple 
speeds on it," Arnett said. Typically that means about 7 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters weighing 40 pounds or less can ride in a baby seat; older toddlers 
might ride in a bike trailer. Arnett said trailers can handle up to 150 pounds, 
"and the weight limit is not on the trailer; it's on how much the bike can 
really pull." 
</P>
<P>
 Every rider should wear a helmet, and state law now requires those younger 
than 18 to wear one. 
</P>
<P>
 All riders should ensure that their bikes are roadworthy. "You want to make 
sure that the tires hold air pressure properly and (that) the brakes and the 
shifting systems are working properly," Arnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also important that riders not overdo it on their first ride. Start with 
a mile or shorter, using a bicycle odometer to keep track of the distance. 
Carry water, especially when riding more than five miles. Riders should bring 
along food if they plan a long ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the San Gabriel River Bike Trail, there are many suitable places for 
riders. The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission publishes a map of 
bike trails, paths and lanes that may be obtained from any Parks and Recreation 
Department office. Or call the commission at (213) 244-6539 and leave an 
address to which a map can be mailed. 
</P>
<P>
 The map also contains tips on bike riding for families and for commuters. The 
Details 
</P>
<P>
 What: Family bike riding. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The San Gabriel River Bike Trail begins just beyond where Azusa Avenue 
becomes San Gabriel Canyon Road. Several other trails can be found on the Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission bike map. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Daylight hours are best for family riding. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: Free.

MILLER GETS NOD; CHANDLER SAYS HE'S SURPRISED; ANALYSIS: IT'S NO SECRET THAT 
KNOX HAS HIGH REGARD FOR BACKUP. THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO RAM QUARTERBACKS HAS 
ALL BUT DISAPPEARED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Chris Miller was named the Rams' starting quarterback Wednesday, and Chuck 
Knox said there was never any doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, however, Knox said he would wait until Wednesday, review medical 
updates and then make his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 What decision? Miller was healthy, and coming off a solid performance against 
the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 After listing Chris Chandler as questionable on Wednesday because of a sore 
ankle, Knox summoned Miller to his office and informed him he would be the 
starting quarterback for Sunday's game against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Knox call Jerome Bettis to his office? Robert Young? Flipper Anderson? If 
Miller is the team's acknowledged No. 1 quarterback, why did Knox meet 
separately with Miller and Chandler Wednesday? Why is there a feeling at Rams 
Park that Miller is on a short leash, and one slip-up and Chandler's in 
command? Why did Chandler report to work Wednesday believing he was going to be 
named the starter? 
</P>
<P>
 "How could there be any question?" Knox said. "Chris Miller is the starting 
quarterback, he was the starting quarterback, he got hurt. He's back to being 
the starting quarterback. OK? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to get into short leashes, long leashes, next week, the end of 
the year and all that type of stuff that you people want so you can put 
somebody in a trick bag. That's not what I'm talking about. He is the starting 
quarterback. I can't make it any more emphatic than that." 
</P>
<P>
 It's no secret, however, that Knox has high regard for Chandler and that he 
has become irritated with Miller's penchant for making excuses when things do 
not go well. It has been mentioned by several of his assistants and it has been 
discussed in the team's front office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never said that I favored one quarterback over the other," Knox said. 
"That is not known, because I have never said it. You can hear that from this 
person or that person, but you never heard it from me. So you're asking me now, 
and I'm telling: Yes, I have said we can win with Chris Chandler because I feel 
we can. I said that when Chris Miller was out and was not going to be playing. 
Just like we can win with Chris Miller, and Chris Miller played well, and he is 
the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not dealing in perceptions. I'm talking with reality, and I've just 
answered the questions." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams gave Miller $9 million over three years to replace Jim Everett, and 
then gave Chandler a one-year contract for $600,000 to be his backup. There 
should be no debate, but after six games the gap between starter and backup has 
all but disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came in today I anticipated I was going to be the starter this week," 
said Chandler, who led the Rams to a 16-0 victory over Kansas City. "But I 
understand Chuck's thought that he would like to see it in practice first, that 
I can go on the ankle. I just know the ankle feels like it's going to be ready 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
 If 100% healthy, would Knox have anointed Chandler, who has completed 58.7% of 
his passes with two touchdowns and no interceptions, his starter? 
</P>
<P>
 Knox doesn't answer hypothetical questions, but it appears Miller's stock has 
plummeted for a variety of reasons: Miller has completed 50% of his passes with 
four touchdowns and five interceptions; he has shown an inability to stay 
healthy; and when asked questions, he has elected to answer honestly rather 
than respond with cliches. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's pretty good when he's healthy," said Mike Martz, Ram quarterbacks coach. 
"I don't think he's ever been himself since the first week of camp. I know he 
hasn't. Some unfortunate things have happened to him; he's just kind of an 
unlucky guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller injured an abdominal muscle early in training camp and his play 
deteriorated. He injured his ribs in the regular-season opener against Arizona, 
and after receiving pain-killing injections to continue playing, he injured his 
shoulder against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to start against Green Bay after missing the second game with 
Atlanta, and compared to Packer quarterback Brett Favre, Miller appeared much 
sharper, even with a strong wind in his face at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big difference now in the way he's throwing the ball," Martz said. 
"He's getting it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very fortunate to have both of them (Miller and Chandler). The other 
guy is a legitimate starter in this league." 
</P>
<P>
 After the loss in Atlanta, Miller said he had difficulty gripping the ball 
because it was wet, the result of center Bern Brostek's pants being wet from 
sweat. Asked about his rib injuries, Miller reluctantly admitted to playing 
with pain. When the story was published there were some Ram coaches who became 
upset, believing Miller had made it known he was hurt to gain sympathy and 
explain why he was playing poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 After last week's loss to Green Bay, Miller was asked what happened on the 
pass he had thrown to Flipper Anderson in the end zone. Miller said the 
receiver had run the wrong route, thereby allowing the defender to intercept 
the pass. A day later, he challenged the offensive play calling in the second 
half against Green Bay; a similar act by Everett a year ago drew a strong 
reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are facts; they're not excuses," Miller said. "I'm not pointing fingers 
at anybody. I'll take the heat, but if I think someone is going to be running a 
route that we have called, and I'm going to throw it, I'm expecting them to be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller flashed leadership skills in training camp and took control of the 
offense, but then he was hurt and began standing to the side while others 
stepped into the huddle. The present uncertainty surrounding the quarterback 
position and Miller's inability to avoid injuries has left the offense 
leaderless in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I played well Sunday and now I'm planning on playing well and putting 
all that other stuff behind us," Miller said. "I expect to pick this team up 
and help win the next two games and be where we want to be at the bye with an 
opportunity to do some good things during the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are searching right now; that happens when a team goes 2-4. 
Mentally it's been hard on me just because I haven't been 100% physically and 
that's showed in my play. And then when you're not on the field how can you be 
a leader? I'm back now, and that's what I plan on doing."

RAM SUITORS' RACE HITS HOMESTRETCH; FOOTBALL: ZONING DECISION A LIFT FOR 
BALTIMORE. ST. LOUIS UPBEAT AFTER MEETING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 St. Louis officials spent 4 1/2 hours with Ram President John Shaw Wednesday, 
attempting to woo the executive with a lucrative relocation offer that would 
make the Rams one of the NFL's most profitable franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Baltimore's bid for the Rams received a shot in the arm when a 
zoning officer from Anne Arundel (Md.) County rejected Washington Redskin owner 
Jack Kent Cooke's application to build a 78,600-seat stadium in Laurel, about 
20 miles south of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cities, which failed to land an NFL expansion team last year, are in a 
fierce battle with Orange County in the race for the Rams, which appears to be 
hitting the homestretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Eagleton, former U.S. senator who headed the four-man St. Louis 
delegation to Los Angeles, said he expects the Rams to make a decision in mid- 
to late-November. The city, which lost the Cardinals to Phoenix after the 1987 
season, hopes to attract the team with a new $258-million, 70,000-seat domed 
stadium and a variety of financial enticements that could push annual revenues 
above $20 million a year. The Rams are projecting a $6 million loss this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton said Wednesday's discussion focused primarily on the big-ticket items 
of a wish list the Rams sent the city in August. St. Louis responded with a 
25-page proposal outlining a plan to raise at least $60 million, through a 
permanent-seat licensing program, to cover costs associated with a move. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis group rushed out of the Century City office building immediately 
after the meeting to catch a flight home, but in a later phone interview, 
Eagleton said the Rams seemed "more and more interested" in their offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked very intelligent questions -- they knew how to read the proposal," 
Eagleton said. "Sometimes they had inquiries about what was behind the 
proposal, but that's understandable because they're the ones who promulgated 
the wish list. Our proposal responded directly to the wish list." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw declined comment on the meeting, other than to say, "They made an offer 
to us, and we hope to review it and get back to them." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis, which has promised the Rams virtually all revenues from the 
publicly funded stadium, is attempting to raise enough to cover some $30 
million the Rams still owe for Anaheim Stadium improvements made in 1980, about 
$15 million for a new practice facility and an estimated $15 million in NFL 
relocation fees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, it is believed the city has offered to spend another $6 million 
to expedite construction of the stadium so it can be ready for the beginning of 
the 1995 season. It has been scheduled to be completed in late October, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also has retained Charlotte, N.C.-based Muhleman Marketing, Inc., 
which helped that expansion city raise $142 million in stadium construction 
funds through a seat-licensing program, in which fans paid a one-time fee, 
ranging from $600 to $5,400, for the right to purchase season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach sports agent Leigh Steinberg, co-chairman of the Orange County 
Save the Rams Task Force, was skeptical about the seat-licensing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "That totally screens out any but the wealthiest fans," he said. "It's fine to 
have that as part of a stadium, but to have that as the majority (of your 
fund-raising efforts)? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton wouldn't discuss specifics of the plan or whether St. Louis has made 
any luxury box or season-ticket sale guarantees, but he said recently that 86 
of the stadium's 100 luxury suites have been leased. 
</P>
<P>
 "We answered various questions about stadium size, the shape it's in, could it 
be completed by the open of the season, and how many other luxury boxes could 
be put on top," Eagleton said. "We have some additional space at the top of the 
stadium, and they asked what it could be used for. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about the seat-licensing plan, and they inquired as to how we were 
going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton said this week that St. Louis is "neck and neck" with Anaheim and had 
a "lead over Baltimore," but Wednesday's developments in Maryland could make it 
a tighter race. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer has maintained that Cooke has been 
blocking efforts by Peter Angelos, the Baltimore Orioles' owner, to bring the 
Rams to Baltimore. And Schaefer expressed concern that NFL Commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue is supporting St. Louis over Baltimore as the Rams search for a home. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday's denial of several zoning exceptions Cooke needs to build a 
stadium in Laurel dealt a serious setback to the owner's hopes of controlling 
both the Washington and Baltimore markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a welcome and positive development," Angelos said. "I think it's 
a very significant setback for Cooke. It clears the air and eliminates the 
Redskins' contention that this area can't support two teams." 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins quickly filed an appeal, and Cooke said he intends to "vigorously 
pursue our object of building the (stadium)." But Robert Wilcox, the hearing 
officer in the case, said the major problem with the Laurel site is parking -- 
the Redskins proposed building 20,077 spaces, but at least 24,100 spaces must 
be provided under county law for a stadium that size. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a close case," Wilcox said. "Simply stated, the property is too 
small for the proposed use." 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Sinclair of the Burson-Marsteller public relations firm of Los Angeles, 
which has been hired by Shaw to handle questions regarding a possible move, 
said the Rams will be watching the situation in Maryland very closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, (the Redskins staying in Washington) would take some of the risk 
out of a move to Baltimore," Sinclair said. "It makes that market more 
attractive. There would be less competition for fans dollars."

NHL DISPUTE EXTENDS TO EUROPE; HOCKEY: CARNBACK WANTS TO PLAY IN SWEDISH ELITE 
LEAGUE IF HE CAN GET AROUND THE OBSTACLE OF HIS CONTRACT WITH THE DUCKS AND THE 
LOCKOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Mighty Duck left wing Patrik Carnback is pursuing opportunities to play in 
Sweden, agent Neil Abbott said Wednesday, the day after the NHL rejected the 
players' latest bargaining proposal, signaling a potentially long lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it's unclear whether the Swedish Elite League is going to accept NHL 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still waiting for an official statement from the NHL," Swedish league 
president Tommy Topel told the Associated Press on Wednesday. "I expect an 
overnight fax. We have to listen to the NHL first because we have an 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira has said Carnback would be violating his 
contract if he plays in Europe, but Abbott said he will try to persuade 
Ferreira to loan Carnback to a team in his native Sweden. However, if Ferreira 
doesn't agree, Abbott hopes to pursue a Swedish contract anyway. He also is 
advising Boston rookie Mariusz Czerkawski to play in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this season is going to be shot, to tell the truth," Abbott said. "I 
don't think there's any realistic chance of the NHL playing in the short term, 
meaning the next two to four months. If by some miracle they happen to say, 
'Let's play' tomorrow, (Carnback) will be on the first plane back. But I can't 
make any case for this ending any time in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott also represents Chicago's Jeremy Roenick, but he is not advising him to 
pursue other playing options, such as the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no up side for him," Abbott said. "He's a premier player and he's 
only 24. A player like him has more to lose than to gain. No one's going to pay 
him enough to warrant the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to play outside the NHL are likely to be a cause for some contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it will cause some ruffled feathers," Abbott said. "Obviously this will 
not make people happy, but legally speaking, the players are willing to honor 
their contracts. I don't think (NHL Commissioner) Gary Bettman has used the 
word lockout per se, but that is what we have. No law is going to stop a player 
from making a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, teams won't like it. They'll yell and scream, but who's to worry? . . . 
Suppose they win (the labor dispute), is it going to be wonderful for players?" 
</P>
<P>
 Carnback, 26, who played professionally in Sweden for six seasons, scored 12 
goals and had 11 assists for the Ducks in his first full NHL season. But Abbott 
said he is advising him to play abroad since he is still trying to develop into 
a front-line NHL player and because he was preparing to play out the option 
year of a contract that was scheduled to pay him $200,000 this season. Without 
a solid showing this season, he isn't likely to be resigned by the Ducks. And 
with such possibilities as non-guaranteed contracts and reduced rosters at 
issue in the dispute, the future for players such as Carnback is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to play. He's 26 years old, he's in his option year and he doesn't 
know where he stands," Abbott said. "I frankly feel if you're 27 or 28 and have 
five or six years in the league, you don't lose your game if you don't play for 
a year. I think kids like Carnback and a few others have a right to make a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's looking to get in an argument between the Ducks and a Swedish team, 
but he's an option-year kid, not Paul Kariya. If he goes and plays, he may come 
back better. The downside if he doesn't play somewhere, is what would he do 
next year?" 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Note 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson said he expects to help coach some players with the San Diego 
Gulls during the lockout and might join the team on the road.

GAME ENHANCES WATSON'S LIFE; ATHLETICS: HE HAS RENEWED ENERGY AND A SENSE OF 
PURPOSE AFTER LEARNING ABOUT WHEELCHAIR TENNIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Watson had just lost in straight sets, congratulated his tennis opponent 
and moved toward the sideline. No excuses, no visible signs of disappointment 
with his play. Not even one complaint about a line call. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing but a smile, and his words about the enjoyment he finds in 
competition. But, after all, he had won the mixed doubles championship earlier 
in the tournament with Sharon Clark of San Francisco, and he still was feeling 
good about that. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was the U.S. Open Wheelchair Tennis Championships at the Racquet 
Club of Irvine, and Watson stood out as an ambassador for this sport and this 
event. Before he became involved in wheelchair tennis about 14 years ago, 
Watson was struggling emotionally. "I really didn't have a life then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been that way for about 16 years after the automobile accident. Watson 
was 18 the night it happened, just a few weeks before his graduation day at 
Tustin High. He and three friends were riding in a car that crashed on Red Hill 
Avenue in Tustin. One friend died; Watson's spinal cord was severed, leaving 
him paralyzed from the chest down. 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost 30 years later now. Watson, 48, lives in Irvine and wheelchair 
tennis has helped change his outlook on life. "I'm a very happy person now," he 
said. "I'm able to travel, see my friends and meet new people playing tennis." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was that terrible, inexorable despair before things finally got 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in and out of hospitals for three years," Watson said. The low point 
was about a year after the accident. "At that stage, I just didn't care 
anymore," he said. "I didn't want to see anyone. I wasn't eating, and I'd 
gotten so weak they had to come into my hospital room to turn me. I couldn't 
even push up with my arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson decided then he was going to die if his attitude didn't change, and he 
began the long and difficult emotional struggle back, fighting depression every 
step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went back to school, got a degree in engineering at Western Tech and took a 
job at Rockwell International for a couple of years, but I still didn't feel I 
had a life and was always looking for something else," he said. "For several 
years, I did a lot of different things . . . anything where I didn't have to 
punch a time card." 
</P>
<P>
 Life was even more difficult for a person using a wheelchair in the 1960s, 
Watson recalled. "When you went out to dinner, you had to go in through the 
kitchen in most places because there wasn't any easy access for you at the 
front door," he said. "It wasn't easy to travel then on airlines, either. There 
were a lot barriers then that have been changed now. And Irvine is one of the 
most progressive cities in the country from that standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson tried his hand at photography for a while, and a high school friend 
helped him revamp a dune buggy so he could control it with his hands. He found 
enjoyment for a while driving that in the desert, but he stopped after a mishap 
gave him second thoughts about his safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing follow the leader, and I went into a deep sand bowl in the 
desert near Mexicali, and the dune buggy turned over on its side when I was 
trying to get out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real turning point, he said, was when he decided to do some physical 
training. "I started working out at Orange Coast College and I met another guy 
in a wheelchair who asked me if I played tennis," he said. "I didn't believe 
him. I had never heard of playing tennis in a wheelchair." 
</P>
<P>
 Not long afterward, Watson met Brad Parks, whose injury in a 1976 snow skiing 
accident had made him paraplegic. Parks was teaching wheelchair tennis, and 
Watson quickly embraced the sport. "I found I could hit the ball fairly well 
from the wheelchair from the beginning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, Watson had played linebacker and offensive tackle in football. 
"I lived for football when I was in high school," he said. "I had always been 
very sports-minded. I think I could have played in college if I had the 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson began teaching wheelchair tennis at various community centers and 
schools, funded initially by a grant from the U.S. Olympic Committee to the 
National Foundation of Wheelchair Tennis that Parks founded in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 That money ran out in 1989 after about four years, but Watson still teaches an 
adult class at Irvine Valley College, and is giving private lessons to five 
others. One is Mark TerBorg, an Irvine resident who suffered severe head 
injuries when he was beaten in a Tampa, Fla., mugging four years ago. Those 
injuries left him paralyzed on the right side and unable to speak intelligibly. 
</P>
<P>
 His younger sister, Tawny, went looking for someone to help her brother play 
tennis again two years ago. She found Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark had been a very good tennis player before, and I wanted him to be able 
to play again," Tawny TerBorg said. "The doctors didn't think he'd live, and 
today he's back playing tennis. He started out in the wheelchair, and now he's 
able to stand stationary and hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike has been wonderful. He doesn't believe in the word 'impossible' and he 
has a great ability to help people come to terms with where they are and what 
they can do to progress." In addition to teaching, Watson enjoys the travel and 
the camaraderie connected to playing in wheelchair tournaments. He plays in 
virtually every division: B-level singles, doubles, mixed doubles and the 
masters level for players 40 and over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tennis is really a social game, and it's a great opportunity to meet people," 
he said. "And a wheelchair player can play singles with an able-bodied player, 
or in doubles with another wheelchair player and two able-bodied players. The 
only difference is that the wheelchair player gets to hit the ball on the 
second bounce." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, who has been his mixed doubles partner for three years, says Watson got 
her going in competitive tennis about four years ago and coached her when she 
was starting out. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of those guys who always has time for you," she said. "He took my 
game from the beginning level to the intermediate level in just one year. He's 
great to play doubles with, too, because nothing ever bothers him. This year we 
were in a tiebreaker in the third set of the finals and I said, 'You're not 
going to get mad at me if I hit the ball out are you?' He said something like, 
'The only thing I care about is that you have fun.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Watson has come a long way since those days of despondency. 
</P>
<P>
 He is outside in the bright Southern California sun, playing a game he enjoys. 
"I really like the competition, and to win," he said, smiling. "But I'm out 
there now to have fun more than anything else."

PREP ROUNDUP; SUNNY HILLS GOES OVERTIME TO BEAT FULLERTON

 Paul Carr scored a goal with a minute left in overtime to give Sunny Hills a 
9-8 Freeway League water polo victory over Fullerton Wednesday at Sunny Hills 
High. 
</P>

CSUN'S DYKES SITS -- AND WONDERS; FOOTBALL: FREE-SPIRITED LINEBACKER, WHO QUIT 
TEAM AFTER BEING SUSPENDED, SAYS HE MIGHT HAVE ACTED HASTILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Billy Ray Dykes Jr. concedes that he was being pulled in several directions at 
once. He admits he wasn't playing as well as he could. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he isn't playing at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykes, a starting inside linebacker at Cal State Northridge, left the team for 
personal reasons two weeks ago amid no acrimony, even less fanfare and a 
smattering of confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he made the right call is hashed out daily in the corners of Dykes' 
mind, he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about it a lot," Dykes said. "I wonder whether I made the right 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it sounds as though Dykes would like to make a comeback, once he gets 
a few personal matters straightened out. The latter contributed to his quitting 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was worried about money, about class, about his family, about school," 
Coach Bob Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I have to worry about the team. I think he was spread too thin." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Dykes is not the traditional player. He took two years off after 
graduating from Kennedy High in 1988 and is a 24-year-old senior. What's more, 
he is embroiled in a lengthy battle with his former girlfriend over custody 
rights to their 3-year-old daughter, Brandy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I've been absent (from practice) a few times, but I had to deal with 
lawyers and go to court because it's important to me," Dykes said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dykes (6-foot-2, 230 pounds) left the team before an Oct. 1 game against Cal 
State Chico when he believed he was going to be benched for arriving late to 
practice after getting delayed in class. It wasn't much of a reason to quit, 
really. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it might not have been reason at all: Burt said he planned to start 
Dykes anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dykes didn't show for the Chico game, though, Burt's hand was forced. 
Dykes was suspended and quit the following week. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a starter. It's not like we were looking for a reason to get rid of 
him," Burt said. "But then, he wasn't playing like we thought Billy Dykes 
should have been playing. I think his head was all turned around." 
</P>
<P>
 It still is, to a degree. During an interview Wednesday, Dykes produced a 
piece of binder paper containing a brief, handwritten list of grievances 
concerning the way he was handled by coaches before he left the team. He then 
characterized his complaints as "just little things, little incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Burt didn't seem to fully understand that I'm not a live-in-the-dorms 
kind of athlete," Dykes said. "I have responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the coach does understand. But Burt also has responsibilities -- to 
the other Matador players. "He missed a couple of practices a week at times, 
all for valid reasons," Burt said. "But that wasn't helping him much as a 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 Burt said he met with the linebacker two days after the Chico game and that 
Dykes left on amicable terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good kid," the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seemingly, Dykes' playing days are now over. A sobering thought, Dykes said, 
one worth . . . reconsidering? 
</P>
<P>
 Burt said during practice Wednesday that his office door is open if Dykes 
wants to discuss the conditions of a return. Thus informed, Dykes said he 
planned to contact the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe football is a complication Dykes can live with after all.

A TOTALLY COOL CALIFORNIA DUDE; BRAZIL'S DE LIMA HAS ADAPTED, AND NOW AIMS FOR 
WATER POLO SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pedro de Lima has mastered the art of blending in with most of the student 
body at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 For a 19-year-old from Brazil who had never visited California before last 
year, it was not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 De Lima came to California to play water polo and refine his English. He took 
a crash course in "American culture" from his new pals. 
</P>
<P>
 He switched from eating black beans and rice to burgers, tacos and pizza. He 
even picked up the slang often used by young Californians, and now regularly 
uses phrases such as "dude," "cool" and "totally." 
</P>
<P>
 One day last week he wore the traditional American college uniform to school: 
denim overalls, tennis shoes and a T-shirt. Before a water polo team practice, 
he joked around in a pickup soccer game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get it, dude," De Lima said with an accent. "Get the ball, man. Come on, 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 Just another college sophomore goofing off with his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Thing is, no matter how "Americanized" he becomes, De Lima will always stand 
out once he hits the water. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his longtime Brazilian buddy, Alexandre Martins, have made quite an 
impact in junior college water polo. 
</P>
<P>
 De Lima and Martins, a 21-year-old freshman, lead the sixth-ranked Pirates in 
scoring. De Lima ranks No. 1 in the state with 68 goals and Martins is fourth 
with 51. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, De Lima led the state with 162 goals and was named an All-American. 
He helped Ventura finish ninth in California and second in the Western State 
Conference with a 23-11-1 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "And he's not a ball hog at all," sophomore driver Mike Pharaon said. "He's a 
team player. He'll pass it to you any time. He just helps us in so many ways." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-feet and 203 pounds, De Lima is a powerful athlete who perfected his 
passing game because he often is double-teamed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's also real smart and real good on the transition," Valley Coach Bill 
Krauss said. "You could tell he's very experienced and you could tell he's 
played internationally. He plays at a different level than most kids here." 
</P>
<P>
 De Lima started playing water polo in his native Sao Paulo at the age of 12 
and first got the idea of competing in the United States after meeting a coach 
from a Southern California junior college at a junior national team event in 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days before classes started at Ventura College in the fall of 1993, De 
Lima moved to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know a thing about him," Pirate Coach Larry Baratte said. "I met him 
the first day of practice. . . . When I saw him play I could tell right away he 
was real good." 
</P>
<P>
 When De Lima came home for Christmas, Martins expressed interest in playing at 
Ventura. The two had competed together on a popular Sao Paulo club team called 
Paineiras and kept in touch after De Lima moved to California.  
</P>
<P>
 "In Brazil water polo is big," De Lima said. "For national championship games 
we'd get about 1,000 people and it's like soccer games where the people are 
totally screaming and jumping real wild. . . . It's not like that here, but I 
still love it here." 
</P>
<P>
 De Lima says playing with Martins again has boosted his performance. He 
believes the reunion has also helped him relax in matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like last year, people didn't know how I play," de Lima said. "They didn't 
know my style. Alex, we know each other so well. I know him better than my 
teammates. And he knows me and what I'm going to do on certain plays. We're a 
lot alike." 
</P>
<P>
 There are differences, however, in their long-term goals. De Lima hopes to 
earn a college scholarship and possibly remain in the country after obtaining a 
business degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Several four-year colleges in the East already have expressed interest. Among 
them, De Lima says, are the University of Massachusetts and Queens College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about living in the snow," De Lima said. "But I think it could 
be a good experience. Besides, I'll still be in the (United States) and school 
will be free . . . hopefully." 
</P>
<P>
 Martins admits he moved to Ventura to improve his English and plans to return 
to Brazil at the end of the school year. He will go back to his job at a local 
bank and finish college in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
 Martins has no desire to become a "typical American college student" like his 
good friend. He's too busy counting the days before he can return home for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 De Lima, on the other hand, will continue absorbing American culture and 
striving to earn a college scholarship in order to extend his visit in the 
United States.

NORTHRIDGE'S 6-11 BRANDT QUITS FOR HEALTH REASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tallest basketball recruit in Cal State Northridge history has left school 
after one of the shortest stays. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Brandt, a 6-foot-11 center from Thousand Oaks High, has dropped out of 
Northridge for "medical reasons," Coach Pete Cassidy said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt committed to Northridge on the first day of the NCAA early signing 
period last November. He was expected to redshirt this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw him as a prospect who would be more of a contributor in the future," 
Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt was not a high school star. He started at center for Thousand Oaks only 
occasionally, but Northridge coaches considered him intelligent and a hard 
worker who possessed the one attribute they couldn't teach: height. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy declined to reveal specifics about Brandt's condition other than to 
say he would probably not be returning to school this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brandt family had little comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll leave it at what Coach Cassidy said," Brandt's mother, Nina, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt's father, Bill, said: "It is definitely not drug-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt's absence should have little impact on Northridge's team, although 
Cassidy said, "It would have been nice to have a seven-footer to practice 
against." 
</P>
<P>
 Shane O'Doherty, a 6-11 senior center, Peter Micelli, a 6-8 senior forward, 
and Tom Samson, a 6-7 sophomore forward, provide experience in the Northridge 
front court.

FLEMING GETS HOT IN COLD; TENNIS: HE BEATS TOM GULLIKSON, 3-6, 7-5, 6-1, IN 
FIRST ROUND AT SHERWOOD COUNTRY CLUB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rail-thin Peter Fleming used a withering service game for a 3-6, 7-5, 6-1 
victory over Tom Gullikson in the opening match of the Digital PC Champions 
tennis tournament at the Sherwood Country Club on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming, who moves on to play tour co-founder Jimmy Connors tonight at 7, 
faced a perilous situation midway through the second set when Gullikson broke 
Fleming's serve to go up three games to two, then held his serve for a 4-2 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fleming racked up a break of his own two games later for a 4-4 deadlock, 
then wore Gullikson down with service velocity and a number of drop shots to 
capture the match's last two sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long matches aren't normally my major strength but the cold weather was great 
for me and I stayed fresh," said Fleming, one of 13 players 35-and-over in 
Thousand Oaks for the 11th stop in the tour's initial season. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of the Champions tour were the match's long points and baseline 
volleys. Both Fleming and Gullikson played an almost-rhythmic style markedly 
different from the high-speed, power game of the mainstream pro tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be a step slower than the young guys and maybe we don't hit the ball 
quite as hard, but people here can see the ball and watch the points develop," 
Gullikson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullikson, who first broke into pro tennis with Fleming in 1976, said his 
usually reliable service game deserted him late in the second set, leaving him 
defenseless. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conditions were dead and the ball wasn't going anywhere, at least off my 
racket," said Gullikson, captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team and personal coach 
of Pete Sampras.  
</P>
<P>
 "But Fleming gave me some opportunities and I just didn't serve well once I 
was up in the second." 
</P>
<P>
 Though competing fiercely, the two players teamed up to win over the chilled 
crowd of 1,500 with frequent banter and playful comments. "Even when we played 
on the regular tour we were more relaxed than the guys are today," said a 
sweating but cheerful Gullikson in the players' lounge.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had more camaraderie and hung out together more; the prize money wasn't so 
big and the top players didn't have entourages." 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's second singles match, Larry Stefanki defeated Roscoe Tanner, 
7-5, 4-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Action today includes John Lloyd against Mel Purcell at 1 p.m., followed by 
Mansour Bahrami against Tim Gullikson. Bjorn Borg and Mel Purcell face Tanner 
and Johan Kriek in doubles after the Connors-Fleming singles match.

GENOVESE VICTIM OF ECONOMY; BASEBALL: LONGTIME GIANT SCOUT LET GO BECAUSE OF 
RESTRUCTURING AND LOSSES FROM THE STRIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Sabean, vice president of scouting and player personnel for the San 
Francisco Giants, said Wednesday that longtime scout George Genovese's position 
was eliminated after 34 years because of organizational restructuring and 
losses associated with the player strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabean said despite appearances, he is neither callous nor insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 But baseball is a microcosm of life, he said, and sometimes feelings are hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuts and employee layoffs are a fiscal reality as the game heads toward the 
turn of the century, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry George has hard feelings," Sabean said. "But I don't know what we 
could do differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Genovese, 72, was told last month that his contract will not be renewed in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Genovese, who lives in North Hollywood and is an area scouting legend, has 
been a minor league coach or scout with the Giants since 1960 and signed such 
luminaries as Gary Matthews, Jack Clark, Dave Kingman, George Foster and Matt 
Williams. Forty-three of Genovese's signees eventually made the 40-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabean, who took over in January, 1993, said the organization has eliminated 
four full-time scouts and none will be replaced. A part-time scouting position 
also was pared. Genovese was the victim of a cold, hard numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in the process over the last two years of fine-tuning how to go 
forward in the areas of player development and scouting," Sabean said. 
"Basically, how to operate leaner and meaner." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabean said in many organizations, Genovese might have been released two years 
ago, when Sabean and General Manager Bob Quinn took over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, when a new regime comes in, they bring the broom," Sabean said. 
"Everybody's gone and the cupboard is stocked with new people. We didn't do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good that he was kept around the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter from Sabean read, in part: 
</P>
<P>
 "The San Francisco Giants thank you for all of your efforts and past 
meritorious service. Good luck in your future endeavors." 
</P>
<P>
 To trim organizational costs, the Giants also have eliminated one rookie-level 
and Class-A team. Genovese believes there should be a place for him somewhere, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Genovese: "I made millions of dollars for the organization with the guys 
I signed." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Sabean: "You could look at it another way. Most people don't last long 
in this game. George had a helluva run."

DIGEST: HART GETS ADDITIONAL TICKETS FOR CANYON GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With tickets for Friday's football game between Hart and Canyon highs already 
sold out at Hart, Canyon officials Wednesday gave an additional 200 tickets to 
Hart.  
</P>
<P>
 A total of 4,000 tickets will be sold on an advance-only basis for the 
expected standing-room-only sellout at Canyon's stadium between the Foothill 
League rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,500 tickets allotted to visiting Hart were sold by Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Canyon still had 600 of its 2,500 on Wednesday, when Bob Messina, Canyon 
associated student body director, gave up one-third of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley College (5-0) is ranked fifth in the state junior college football poll 
with Moorpark (3-1) 13th and Ventura (3-1) 16th. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark secured a berth among the top 20 with a 23-20 upset of Bakersfield on 
Saturday.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: AZTECS' GUTIERREZ DOWN AND OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A brief but brilliant college stint ended, a possible NFL career was 
jeopardized and the hopes of a team were dampened when San Diego State 
quarterback Tim Gutierrez suffered a shattered left collarbone Saturday in a 
38-22 defeat to Utah at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sick for the young man," Aztec Coach Ted Tollner said of Gutierrez, a 
senior from Santa Clara High who had thrown for 1,566 yards and 11 touchdowns 
but is lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go into your senior year with high expectations and all of a sudden 
it's over . . . I felt sick when it happened," Tollner said. "The guy's worked 
too hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez started only 14 games at San Diego State after replacing injured 
David Lowery in 1993, and he became the 11th quarterback in school history to 
pass for more than 4,000 yards (4,740). He finished with the second-highest 
completion percentage (62%) and had 36 touchdown passes and 19 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "All our hope, offensively, was on his experience and his ability," said 
Tollner, whose Aztecs are 2-4 after starting 2-0. "He was having a good year, 
and we felt at any time he could move to another level to where he could have 
an outstanding year." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez was rolling to his right, looking for a receiver, when he was hit 
from behind by Utah defensive end Bronzell Miller (6 feet 4, 245 pounds). 
Miller body-slammed Gutierrez to the turf, the quarterback's shoulder taking 
the full force of the impact. Gutierrez was taken from the field to an 
operating room at nearby Mercy Hospital, where surgeons performed a bone graft 
and fit a metal plate to reassemble the quarterback's clavicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty down," Gutierrez said this week. "It's going to be tough to 
recover, because of where I was headed in my career. I still have dreams of 
getting to the (NFL). But this is a major setback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting a lot of letters from agents saying I was one of the top 10 
quarterbacks. Ten quarterbacks usually go in the top three rounds. Maybe 
Tollner can help." 
</P>
<P>
 Tollner, who has coached in the NFL in Buffalo, San Diego and with the Rams, 
in fact, called the Gutierrez family in Oxnard and said, "I will find a place 
for him somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Utah, Gutierrez had completed 13 of 16 passes for 132 yards and one 
touchdown when he was injured with 1 minute 22 seconds left in the first half. 
Just 98 seconds earlier, Gutierrez threw his last pass as an Aztec -- a 
nine-yard strike to Ken Overby for a touchdown that tied the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 His 36 scoring passes tie him for sixth at San Diego State. Among those who 
rank higher are Dennis Shaw, Brian Sipe, Dan McGwire and Don Horn, all of whom 
played in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Injury and insult: Gutierrez wasn't the only area player San Diego State lost 
Saturday to a season-ending injury. Sophomore running back Freddie Edwards 
(Antelope Valley High) suffered a broken right leg and sprained ligaments in 
his right ankle on a 14-yard gain in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards, the Aztecs' second-leading rusher (18 carries, 83 yards) had three 
carries for 34 yards and a six-yard reception before he joined Gutierrez in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was my next-door neighbor," Gutierrez said. "I saw him go into surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore kicker Peter Holt (Antelope Valley High) wasn't injured, but he lost 
his job after missing a 19-yard field-goal attempt that would have given San 
Diego State a 3-0 lead. His replacement, sophomore Matt George (Canyon), missed 
a 40-yard attempt in the fourth quarter. Holt has made only five of 11 attempts 
this season, his longest from 32 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carter upstaged again: Throughout his four years at Arizona, senior running 
back Ontiwaun Carter (Kennedy) has either shared the spotlight or been 
overshadowed by the likes of Chuck Levy and Billy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked hard, but I've had to rotate," said Carter, who has 3,000 yards 
in his Wildcat career, 371 shy of all-time leader Art Luppino's school record 
mark. "All those years my family and friends would say, 'Someday you'll be the 
guy.' Now I'm definitely showing what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 But Carter was upstaged again Saturday in his greatest game at Arizona: 224 
yards in 36 carries, 56 yards on eight receptions. The Wildcats (4-1) were 
upset by unbeaten Colorado State, 21-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really put a damper on (my performance)," Carter said. "I went in there 
and played my heart out to try to bring us back. We had planned to go 
undefeated. It's my senior year and I'm taking it to heart." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the country: Senior wide receiver Curtis Marsh (Simi Valley/Moorpark 
College) of Utah is fourth in the WAC in receiving yards (403 in 27 catches) 
and leads in touchdown catches with six. Marsh had 116 yards on eight 
receptions against San Diego State, including a 20-yard touchdown that opened 
the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State senior free safety Lance Thomas (Crespi/Moorpark College) is 
eighth in the WAC in tackles (58) and is tied for fourth in interceptions 
(three). 
</P>
<P>
 Carter ranks second to Washington's Napoleon Kaufman in the Pacific 10 
Conference in rushing (141.2 yards per game) and all-purpose yardage (164.6). . 
. . Weber State junior quarterback Bryan Martin (Granada Hills) threw for 296 
yards and three touchdowns in a 62-37 loss to Northeast Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior middle linebacker Scott Blade (Canyon) of San Diego State is the team's 
second-leading tackler with 46. . . . Pacific has moved senior Howard Blackwell 
(Hart) from running back to reserve wide receiver. He has four receptions for 
41 yards. . . . Tufts junior quarterback Greg Peters (Harvard-Westlake) 
completed 12 of 19 for 252 yards and one touchdown in a 27-7 victory over 
Bates.

THE COLLEGES / MIKE HISERMAN; CSUN RULE BOOK SEEMS TO BE MISSING A PAGE ON 
COMMON SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rules, rules and more rules. Pages and pages of rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Rules on how to dress inside the cafeteria. Rules about uniforms. Warnings 
about gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Violators of training camp curfew must participate in a "Dawn Fun Run." So it 
says on the first page of the Cal State Northridge football team handbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Must be something on missing practice in here. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Yep, here it is, on Page 6: "You will be responsible to attend all scheduled 
football events. This includes meetings, practices and contests. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 A pretty good linebacker stumbled over that one. He skipped a practice and was 
benched for an Oct. 1 home game against Cal State Chico. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't blow off practice and get away with it at Northridge. All the 
players know it. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why one of them showed up for drills on the afternoon of Aug. 29 
this year -- only hours after his arrest in connection with a double shooting 
in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the player shot a security guard and a woman as they sat in a truck 
outside a bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman is the player's former girlfriend and the mother of his child. She 
was struck once in the hip as she tried to flee. Her acquaintance was hit in 
the arm and chest, a potentially lethal shot that was deflected by a 
bullet-proof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Beauregard was jailed for investigation of assault with a deadly 
weapon, but within hours he was released on $15,000 bail. The charges later 
were upgraded to attempted murder with additional special circumstances of 
using a handgun and inflicting great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
 He remains free. And he remains a member of the Northridge football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Felonies. Isn't there a section on alleged felonies? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 You can't leave training meals until you have been excused by a coach. You 
must bring your playbook and a writing instrument to meetings. Loud music in 
the locker room is strictly prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing on felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 What the good book does say is that players in "trouble with the law" shall be 
"presumed innocent until proven otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough. But what about deception? Isn't there a section on deception? 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting incident occurred on the first day of school. Beauregard, a 
two-year starter at offensive guard, never told his coaches, teammates or 
Northridge administrators.  
</P>
<P>
 He managed to keep his secret until 12 days ago when Coach Bob Burt was 
approached outside the Northridge locker room by a reporter who detailed the 
allegations of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt retreated into the team room, emerging later to say that the player was 
refusing comment -- to the coach and the press -- on the advice of his 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, Beauregard was in the starting lineup against Chico State. 
Meanwhile, a linebacker who missed a practice watched from the sidelines 
dressed in street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there not something skewed about such a scenario? 
</P>
<P>
 At some point, common sense surely must override a team handbook. An athlete 
accused of a felony owes an explanation to his coach and team. 
</P>
<P>
 This player chose to remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge athletic administrators worry that suspending players in such cases 
might leave the school vulnerable to a lawsuit if they are found innocent.  
</P>
<P>
 They can't understand how other schools -- a whole bunch of them -- can impose 
sanctions on an athlete who hasn't had his day in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the term might be debated by some, playing football for the Matadors 
must still be considered a privilege. It is no person's God-given right to be 
included as a member of a college athletic team. 
</P>
<P>
 With privileges come higher standards. Says so in the team handbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Page 6, Section 3: ". . . Your deportment -- conduct on campus, on road trips, 
and in the community -- must be better than expected of the regular student." 
</P>
<P>
 Break the code and become . . . a regular student. What's wrong with that? 
</P>
<P>
 Let Beauregard stay in school. His scholarship should be honored. It's his 
place on the football team that should be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, he has embarrassed coaches and teammates by his deception. 
Such serious allegations never should have been kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, a hand injury is supposed to keep Beauregard sidelined until 
sometime after his Oct. 19 arraignment. His status with the team beyond that 
point has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the handbook says, "Any trouble with the law will be dealt with on the 
basis of presumed innocence until proven guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge officials are using that passage like a shield. "I'm not a 
policeman, a judge or a district attorney," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a football coach and he's a football player and a student. He deserves 
the same rights everybody else has." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a coach has to play by the book. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's best to mix in a little common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense. Doesn't the handbook say anything about common sense? 
</P>
<P>
 There is a segment that reads, "Negative action (i.e., trouble with the law, 
violating dorm rules, etc.) of a football player is a direct reflection on our 
football program and your football teammates and coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, that reflection looks bad.

2 SOUTH BAY AUTO DEALERS ARE ON O.C. BUYING SPREE; RETAILERS: THE PAIR QUIETLY 
ACQUIRES LOCAL ROLLS-ROYCE AND INFINITI FRANCHISES AND ARE POISED TO SNAP UP 
TWO OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pair of South Bay auto dealers have been quietly buying up high-profile 
Orange County dealerships in the past month, including a Rolls-Royce dealership 
and three Costa Mesa franchises owned by former American Honda officials 
involved in a kickback scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 South Bay AutoHaus owner William Adkins and partner Jerry Heuer, an investor 
in a string of Torrance and Santa Monica dealerships, have purchased 
Rolls-Royce dealer Newport Auto Center in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa Infiniti 
for an undisclosed amount. The two also have an agreement to buy Costa Mesa 
Honda and are negotiating for the purchase of Costa Mesa Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Auto Center had been owned by Steven Bren, a son of Irvine Co. owner 
Donald L. Bren. In addition to Rolls-Royces, the dealership sold Chevrolets, 
Audis, Porsches and Bentleys. It has long been reported to be in financial 
difficulty because of the recession and the short-lived federal luxury tax on 
high-priced autos. 
</P>
<P>
 The three Costa Mesa dealerships were owned by Mark L. Benson and Edward A. 
Temple, former American Honda executives who earlier this year pleaded guilty 
to felony charges in an ongoing federal fraud and bribery probe of Honda 
franchise activity in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson and Temple still own the Honda franchise, and Heuer said that he and 
Adkins are purchasing it from them, rather than from Torrance-based American 
Honda Motor Co. Inc. None of the Benson-Temple dealerships were in financial 
trouble; their legal problems appear to have prompted the sales.  
</P>
<P>
 Honda officials declined to comment. Benson declined comment and Temple could 
not be reached. Jim Haslem, an attorney for Benson and the three Costa Mesa 
dealerships, said he was "not aware of any pressure brought to bear" by 
Nissan's Infiniti division to force the sale of the Infiniti franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cypress-based Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, spokesman Kim Custer said 
that the company is in the final stages of terminating Benson and Temple's 
Mitsubishi franchise because of their legal problems and could not discuss the 
matter further. Haslem said that Benson and Temple surrendered the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Heuer said that he and Adkins are purchasing the Mitsubishi franchise, which 
has been closed for several weeks, directly from the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Heuer would not discuss other circumstances of the sales. But industry sources 
say that Honda and Mitsubishi had been pressuring Benson and Temple to sell or 
surrender their dealerships. Most auto companies have so-called morals clauses 
in their franchise agreements that can be used to oust dealers convicted of 
serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud, and Temple pleaded guilty to 
a count of conspiracy in connection with their activities as zone sales 
managers with American Honda in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 New car franchises in recessionary Southern California have not been moving at 
premium prices in recent years. The troubled backgrounds of the four Orange 
County dealerships suggest those sales do not signal a resurgence in the 
industry, said Kevin Allen, executive director of the Orange County Motor Car 
Dealers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "However," he added, "Orange County's economy is starting to pick up and auto 
sales are picking up, so this is a good time to buy a dealership." 
</P>
<P>
 Heuer said he and Adkins began looking several months ago for franchises to 
acquire outside of the South Bay. "We have been hammered so hard by the 
recession, and with the continuing cuts in aerospace employment, we felt that 
we had to diversify," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They began talks with Honda, Mitsubishi and Benson and Temple about the Orange 
County dealers' three operations, he said, and almost simultaneously learned 
that Steven Bren was interested in selling Newport Auto Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figured that if we were going to be in Costa Mesa, we might as well be in 
Newport Beach too," Heuer said. "We like to cluster our stores because we can 
get certain economies of scale that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Newport Beach franchise that could interest the two South Bay dealers 
is Newport Imports, the bankrupt Jaguar and Range Rover dealership that was 
seized and closed by its bankers last week.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: 'SCUDBUSTER' SIMULATIONS ARE POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR 
REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 No Scud missiles yet in this latest confrontation with Iraq. But they're there 
. . . somewhere. Then again, so is the next generation of Raytheon's Patriot 
antiballistic missiles. It's been three years since these missiles first dueled 
in the nighttime skies, and Raytheon promises that its new breed of 
"Scudbusters" is even deadlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Iraqi Scuds be launched against vulnerable U.S. positions, just how 
much better would these new and improved Patriots do this time around? What 
kind of technical breakthroughs do three years of analysis, testing and 
modification buy in antiballistic missile defense? The (unclassified) answers 
to those questions reveal disturbing realities about innovation in defense 
technology and the pathology of procurement. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Gulf War, we learned things we never expected to learn," says Stephen 
R. Stanvick, a vice president of Raytheon's missile systems division and its 
air defense program manager. So ever since the end of the war, Raytheon has 
pursued an Army QRP -- a quick response program -- designed to implement that 
knowledge. The range of Patriot's radar has increased by about 50%; the timing 
sequences of its explosive fuses have been enhanced; critical targeting 
software has been improved. 
</P>
<P>
 A weapons system that the Army and Raytheon claim enjoyed an anti-Scud success 
rate of better than 70% in Saudi Arabia and more than 40% in Israel (that 
performance gap is due to "operational differences") has now been "meaningfully 
improved," says Stanvick. More precise promises of effectiveness have 
understandably been classified. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, though, assessment of the true performance of the Patriots 
against the Scuds has been the subject of bitter controversy since the war's 
end. Top Israeli military officials such as former Defense Minister Moshe Arens 
have flatly dismissed the Patriot as ineffectual. Careful examination of Army 
data by the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Research Service 
cast strong doubts on the success rates claimed for Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapon system's sharpest critic, Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
Prof. Theodore A. Postol, acknowledges that the Patriot QRP "has a number of 
fixes that go in the right direction, but we don't think these fixes are going 
to fix the problems against the al Hussein (the Iraqi Scuds)." In fact, after 
extensively reviewing available non-classified data, Postol and his fellow 
critics have concluded that "there are no benefits that are real for deploying 
Patriots in Israel or Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
 Raytheon, of course, dismisses the criticisms as unfounded -- pointing with 
confidence to classified information it says validates its Patriots. Putting 
aside, for the moment, the personal passions and institutional infighting that 
surround the Patriot, there are some agreed-upon facts that reveal just what 
the Pentagon and its contractors are -- and are not -- prepared to do to 
measurably improve its weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, since the end of the war, neither Raytheon nor the Army has 
tested its improved Patriots against a real Scud. "We have not flown it against 
a Scud," acknowledges Raytheon's Stanvick. Raytheon tested the Patriot exactly 
once last year against a "Storm" missile -- which is an Army-built missile 
designed to impersonate a Scud. When's the next test? Raytheon's not sure. "We 
are target-poor and waiting for target deliveries," says Stanvick. 
</P>
<P>
 But who makes Scuds, and who has turned them into the ballistic missile of 
choice for aspiring underdeveloped countries, from Syria to North Korea to 
Iraq? Russia. Who desperately needs hard currency and U.S. technical support? 
Russia. If the Pentagon so desired, it could easily spend a few million dollars 
to get some Scuds and a technical crew from Russia, ship them to White Sands, 
and test our ballistic missile defense technologies against a genuine, 
real-world missile threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why we didn't go to the Russians and ask them to sell us 
Scuds after the war," says Postol. "It's reasonable to expect to see all these 
technology improvements tested against the actual weapons they were designed 
for." 
</P>
<P>
 "They should be doing that; it's a good idea," agrees John Lehman, who was 
secretary of the Navy for six years during the Reagan Administration defense 
buildup. In fact, in the wake of the success of the French Exocet missile 
during the war in the Falklands, Lehman demanded that the Navy test its ship 
defenses against real Exocets: That data proved exceedingly valuable. Patriot 
supporters should be similarly inclined, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that kind of recommendation from us would be kind of 
specious," says Bob Stein, another vice president of Raytheon's missile systems 
division. "I wouldn't see the value of that. . . . I believe that we've run all 
the adequate tests necessary. I don't believe that we should be waiting and 
hoping for another test." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Stein, who has been involved with the Patriot program for nearly 20 
years, points out that live weapons testing is a small part of predicting 
performance. "Most of our knowledge of the system comes from a variety of 
fairly complex computer simulations that we do," he says. "That's where you 
really exercise the system. The value of the live testing is to look at the way 
the radar and the data confirm what you have done in the simulations. It's 
very, very elaborate . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But a vociferous portion of the defense technology community -- including 
Lehman and Postol -- fear that computer simulation, no matter how sophisticated 
or elaborate, is becoming more of a substitute for than a complement for live 
testing. In other words, too many weapons designers are choosing to simulate 
reality than live in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simulation has an important role to play," says Lehman. "But too much of it 
is part of this insidious hollowing out of the military that takes place when 
you have this big of a budget crunch. Testing against the real threat can be 
expensive, but if we can do it, that's what we should do." 
</P>
<P>
 One can only hope that the question of how well Patriots can perform in 
wartime will never again need to be answered. But it is a sobering reality of 
defense technology acquisition today that we seem unwilling and unable to test 
the lessons we say we've learned in a real environment. Hardly a comforting 
thought for the people who are risking their lives in the Gulf.

BRAVOS AND SHUDDERS GREET MOGULS' PLAN FOR NEW STUDIO; HOLLYWOOD: SOME WONDER 
IF THERE'S ROOM FOR THE COMPETITION FROM THE VENTURE PLANNED BY SPIELBERG, 
GEFFEN AND KATZENBERG. 
</P>

<P>
 Like Hollywood's version of Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti, The Three Moguls 
faced a paparazzi-style news conference to announce plans to form a new studio, 
touching off a wave of bravos throughout the day from Hollywood executives. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry scrambled for superlatives to praise Steven Spielberg, David 
Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg on the bold move, starting with Walt Disney Co. 
Chairman Michael Eisner, who telephoned the trio just before they announced 
their plans Wednesday morning for an unnamed, full-service entertainment 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredibly unique combination. If you're looking for a new company to 
do business with, what better combination than these guys?" entertainment 
lawyer Skip Brittenham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Walt Disney Motion Pictures Chairman Joe Roth: "This is a great deal all 
around. Jeffrey has two terrific business partners. They have him to run the 
company. And there's another bona fide buyer in town." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the inescapable fact is that the new entity could soon turn into a 
formidable competitor for much of Hollywood, as well as a significant raider of 
executive talent. Some question if there is even room for another player. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things will become more competitive, and there are only so many movies to 
make and so much audience to go after," said 20th Century Fox President Bill 
Mechanic, who worked for Katzenberg when the hyper-ambitious executive headed 
Walt Disney Studios. "Because everything that everyone does has an impact on 
everyone else, this probably won't help the overall business." 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmaker Spielberg has a different view, arguing that the market is more 
elastic when good films are being made. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past two summers proved that the market can expand if the movies are 
there and people want to see them. The notion of 'competition' doesn't apply," 
Spielberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 One ever-present question throughout the day was whether Katzenberg will tap 
executive talent at Disney for the new venture, in much the same way Eisner 
jump-started Disney 10 years ago by staffing Disney's ranks with his former 
colleagues at Paramount Pictures -- Katzenberg among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney director Ray Watson concedes that the first thing that came to his 
mind Wednesday morning when he read about the new venture was whether 
Katzenberg planned to lure some of Disney's prized animation talent to the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether Katzenberg -- who is said to still be working out 
details of his exit agreement -- is bound by any promise to keep his hands off 
Disney executives. Disney officials and directors such as Watson said they 
don't know the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources at the company noted that so many executives are under contract, 
it would be difficult for them to leave and very expensive to buy out their 
contracts. Enforcing the point, Roth said, "Everyone here is under contract, 
and I expect these contracts to be observed." 
</P>
<P>
 David Hoberman, president of motion pictures for Walt Disney Studios, said he 
has "a long contract and I intend to fulfill it. . . . In any case, no one has 
approached me. It's all premature because they're focused on the big picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said it is unlikely that executives, especially in animation, would 
leave the security of Disney, clearly the industry's top animation company. 
</P>
<P>
 "To go from a known entity to an unknown one? I'd be very surprised," Watson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And one producer noted that the three want to keep their start-up costs down 
and are unlikely to go on a hiring binge. While the three will need someone to 
handle business affairs, "what do they need with distribution executives and 
marketing executives now, or 12 creative executives giving story notes?" he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other immediate question is how much of a vacuum the new entity will 
create for MCA Inc., where one executive called the announcement "no cause for 
celebration." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment has been the company's premier supplier of 
entertainment over the years. But others suggested that MCA will probably play 
a role, perhaps as an initial distributor and licenser for the new company. 
There were even unsubstantiated rumors that the three would eventually link up 
with MCA and buy a chunk of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amblin is a highly important supplier for us. But (Amblin chief) Walter 
Parkes called me first thing this morning to make it clear that he intends to 
meet all of his obligations to us. I hope, when things settle down, that we'll 
be in business on some level with this new company . . . that there will be an 
important strategic alliance between us all," said Casey Silver, president of 
MCA's Universal Pictures unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives said they believe the three will probably risk a minimal amount of 
their own fortunes, because they should be able to raise money easily given 
their track records. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be extremely anxious to have the opportunity to finance the 
venture," said John Miller, chief of Chemical Bank's entertainment lending. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment lawyer Peter Dekom said time may be the company's only enemy. 
"It takes 18 months to two years to get into the theatrical production business 
and four years to finish an animated film. Movies don't grow on trees . . . you 
have to plant seeds. These are aggressive guys eager to get going, and 
frustration could set in." 
</P>
<P>
 One producer said he was puzzled by the lack of detail: "I'm looking for the 
meat. I want to say, 'Hooray, Steven Spielberg is in the studio business.' But 
I don't see it yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, said they have so much confidence in the three that the lack 
of detail doesn't matter at this stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they have got to do is show up in the morning. They're not reinventing 
anything they've not done before," said Arnold Rifkin, worldwide head of the 
motion picture division at William Morris Agency.

FAMILY HOPES SMALL CLAIMS HAVE BIG IMPACT; TOBACCO: RELATIVES HAVE SUED 
CIGARETTE MAKERS OVER THE DEATH OF THEIR MOTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Still grieving over their mother's death last year from lung cancer, the 
children of Della Koenigshofer are trying to put the hurt where they think it 
belongs -- on the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In a novel attack on cigarette makers, seven members of the Koenigshofer 
family have taken the cigarette companies into small claims court in Los 
Angeles and Riverside to answer to wrongful death suits. 
</P>
<P>
 With small claims damages capped at $5,000 a case, the Koenigshofers aren't 
seeking a big recovery. Instead, they say, they hope to pioneer a way for 
anguished families of ordinary means to make life miserable for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not for the money," said Melinda Hipp-Koenigshofer, who, along with her 
father, four brothers and a nephew, filed the claims in August. "It's more of a 
statement of our feeling that the tobacco companies have knowingly and 
willingly addicted people to this product -- knowing that it's a health hazard 
and potentially fatal, as it was in our mother's case." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for two of the defendants, Philip Morris Inc. and R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Co., denounced the lawsuits as improper and unfair and predicted they 
will be dismissed. Three of the cases are set for hearing today in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 40 years, tobacco companies have had remarkable success in 
defending liability claims; they have yet to pay a nickel in settlements or 
judgments to those who sued them for smoking-related harms. Only rarely have 
the companies even had to win in court. In many cases, financially exhausted 
plaintiffs simply threw in the towel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Koenigshofer, a psychology professor at Chaffey Community College in 
Rancho Cucamonga and the oldest of five Koenigshofer children, said the family 
hopes to even the odds in the informal venue of small claims court, where 
lawyers are not needed -- nor even allowed to speak for contending parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory there, he said, could give thousands of others "a forum for attacking 
cigarette companies, without spending a lot of money and without being buried 
in a huge amount of legal technicalities which prevent the case from ever being 
heard on its merit." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the strategy could face special problems in California, where, in 
1987, the Legislature barred most lawsuits against manufacturers of cigarettes 
or other products deemed inherently unsafe and recognized as such by consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koenigshofers contend their claims fall within exceptions to the law. But 
tobacco officials expressed confidence that the suits are precluded and will be 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're optimistic (that) we will prevail," said John J. Mulderig, a lawyer for 
Philip Morris. "The California statute is really clear that with product 
liability actions that involve products like cigarettes whose risks are a 
matter of common knowledge, those claims are barred." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the companies are taking no chances. As they always do in wrongful 
death cases, they are poking into the personal histories of the deceased and 
her family, sifting for ammunition to aid in the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Koenigshofers, tobacco company representatives have been 
contacting relatives and friends with questions about the family. Ken 
Koenigshofer's ex-wife, who asked not to be named, said two men showed up on 
her doorstep after dark one night last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just appeared on my porch at about 8 o'clock and they were both dressed 
in suits," she said in an interview. "They never identified themselves or what 
kind of work they did. . . . They just said we have been talking with anyone 
who knew the Koenigshofers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked, . . . 'You want me to speak against the Koenigshofers?' and he said 
yes . . . I would not speak with them and they left." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the men were sent by Philip Morris, Mulderig said he "wouldn't be 
able to comment on any investigative activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Carter, manager of media relations for R.J. Reynolds, said she had "no 
doubt she (Koenigshofer's ex-wife) was visited by someone looking into this 
case." But Carter said she didn't know if the men were sent by Reynolds, which 
directs its agents "to identify themselves when they make the call as to who 
they are and who they are representing." 
</P>
<P>
 But both Carter and Mulderig said the tobacco firms understandably are 
scrambling for information because their usual right to pretrial discovery 
materials does not exist in the small claims setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our view, a case involving complex medical issues where no right of 
discovery exists is just improper," Mulderig said. "We know nothing about this 
person's smoking history. And the small claims forum, in our view, was 
purposely selected to cut off our rights to discover those facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Morris last year turned back a reformed Seattle-area smoker's attempt 
to win reimbursement in small claims court for his costs of quitting smoking. A 
judge concluded that the statute of limitations had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to her family, Della Koenigshofer began smoking as a teen-ager in 
the 1940s -- when smoking was universally portrayed as glamorous and suave, and 
there were no warnings of the risks. She was happy her children did not smoke, 
but seemingly unable to quit despite the encouragement they gave her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was an innocent consumer who was seduced to use the product and by the 
time it became evident how damaging it was, she was seriously physically 
dependent," said John Koenigshofer, 39, one of her sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hard on her about her smoking," recalled Eric Koenigshofer, a lawyer in 
Santa Rosa. "I didn't allow smoking in my house, and I have this vivid image of 
my mother sitting outside in a lawn chair, under a tree outside the French 
doors, in a coat, having a cigarette," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question in my mind that this woman was addicted to cigarettes," 
Eric Koenigshofer said. "Every measure of influence that was available to her 
loved ones was applied to . . . bully her into cessation of smoking, and she 
wasn't able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the family has filed small claims actions only against 
Lorillard Inc., saying Della Koenigshofer smoked the company's Kent cigarettes 
during the years she lived in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, while living in Hemet, they say she smoked various brands made by 
Philip Morris, Reynolds, American Tobacco, Brown & Williamson, and Liggett 
Group -- all of which are named in the Riverside cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Della Koenigshofer was 70 when she died, but came from a long-lived family, 
her children said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that she was cheated of more life and that we were cheated of more 
years of relationship with her," Ken Koenigshofer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been over a year, and I still miss her terribly," said 
Hipp-Koenigshofer. "She was a wonderful mother. She was a wonderful grandmother 
. . . My 9-year-old still cries at night sometimes because he misses her."

GARAMENDI UNVEILS QUAKE POLICY PLANS; INSURANCE: INDUSTRY OFFICIALS AND 
CONSUMER ADVOCATES CRITICIZE PROPOSAL TO OFFER BARE-BONES, STAND-ALONE 
COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to remedy the near meltdown of the California residential 
insurance market, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi on Wednesday proposed 
selling stripped-down, stand-alone earthquake policies to all comers through 
the state's high-risk property insurance pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policies are meant to plug gaps caused by the flight of most large 
insurers from the California homeowners market after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Both consumer advocates and industry officials criticized the proposal at a 
public hearing in Los Angeles on Wednesday, but Garamendi insisted that he 
would push to implement a modified version before he leaves office Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to leave this mess for my successor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how the plan ultimately looks, it became clear Wednesday that most 
Californians who buy earthquake insurance will soon be paying more for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 56 insurers have asked the Insurance Department for rate increases since 
the Jan. 17 quake. Even the more moderate requests would boost rates by 50% to 
100% for most policyholders, Deputy Insurance Commissioner William Ahern said. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, earthquake insurance now costs an average of about $2 per 
$1,000 of coverage. However, an official of a San Francisco engineering firm 
hired by the Insurance Department testified that projected annual losses from 
future quakes on pre-1950 homes in Los Angeles, San Francisco and other coastal 
areas would range from $2 to $24 per $1,000 of coverage, depending on the 
stability of the soil under the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing Northridge quake losses that may exceed $10 billion, insurers 
representing up to 80% of the California market have either suspended or 
sharply cut back sales of homeowners and earthquake insurance. State law 
requires that companies selling homeowners policies also offer earthquake 
coverage, so many insurers temporarily dropped both lines to avoid earthquake 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi and much of the insurance industry agree that the ultimate solution 
is to create a federal reinsurance pool to cover hurricanes, floods, quakes and 
other disasters. But such a proposal died in Congress this year, and the 
Legislature failed to act on a state pool. So Garamendi is proposing his own 
stop-gap program through the California Fair Plan, the industry-financed 
insurer of last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fair Plan already offers earthquake insurance packaged with the bare-bones 
fire insurance policies it has traditionally sold in inner cities and brush 
fire zones. During the summer, Garamendi ordered the Fair Plan to offer those 
policies statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday's proposal would allow an insurer to write a conventional 
homeowners policy and then refer the customer to the Fair Plan for an 
earthquake policy. The goal is to lure insurers back into the homeowners market 
while providing a mechanism for earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed Fair Plan policies would limit dwelling coverage to $400,000 and 
a maximum of only $10,000 for exterior structures. For example, swimming pool 
damage would be limited to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi did not say what the Fair Plan policies would cost. He said he would 
announce the prices and act on the insurers' rate increase requests at the same 
time, "well before" Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates said the coverage is too limited to be of much value. 
Besides, some said, the whole crisis is phony. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only homeowners insurance crisis in California is the one created by the 
industry in order to protect profits," said Harry Snyder, co-director of the 
West Coast office of Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers said Wednesday's proposal wouldn't change their ultimate exposure to 
earthquakes, since Fair Plan losses are passed straight through to them. They 
also challenged its legality. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi contends he has the authority to implement his plan without 
legislative action. He invited the industry Wednesday to challenge him in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, insurance agents complained they would get the blame for selling 
policies that offer far less protection than homeowners expect from earthquake 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Stephen L. Young of the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of 
California: "As an agent, you can explain about the limitations of the Fair 
Plan till you're blue in the face, but when the earthquake comes and people 
really find out what's covered -- here come the lawsuits."

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: SPOTLIGHT ON HONG KONG; A FADING CROWN JEWEL?; 
UNCERTAINTIES ABOUND AS POWER TRANSFER NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In about 1,000 days, the British rulers of Hong Kong will hand over control of 
the crown colony to China. While that makes many of Hong Kong's freewheeling 
capitalists uneasy, those concerns are well hidden by the sights and sounds of 
a fast-growing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hong Kong's Kwai Chung container port, for example, cargo ships jam up 
against the docks piled high with Chinese-made products bound for export. In 
the main business district, growing legions of foreign business people brave 
traffic-choked streets, briefcases and cellular phones in hand. On a nearby 
island, construction workers have begun laying the groundwork for a $21-billion 
airport and related facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is booming," said Meocre Li, managing partner for Arthur Andersen's 
Hong Kong and China operations. In fact, one of Li's biggest problems in the 
territory's tight labor market is expanding Andersen's 500-employee Hong Kong 
office while competitors try to lure away his workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hong Kong's powerhouse economy faces numerous problems, including 
lingering disputes between British and Chinese officials, high inflation and a 
slumping stock market. In addition, the colony's traditional and lucrative role 
as a middleman between China and the West is being challenged by Shanghai and 
other rapidly developing Chinese cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hong Kong is still a very important stepping stone for American (and other 
foreign) companies to China," said Wei Li, who follows the Chinese economy as 
an assistant professor at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. But 
"as China becomes more sophisticated, the importance of Hong Kong as a stepping 
stone will decline." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hong Kong's economy is expected to grow about 6% this year and next. 
The economic well-being of Hong Kong and its approximately 6 million residents 
depends primarily on the economy and policies of neighboring China. Under an 
agreement between Britain and China, the Chinese have vowed to keep their hands 
off Hong Kong's free-market economy, policies and currency until 50 years after 
the power transfer in July, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hong Kong and Chinese economies are already intertwined. Since China 
began to open its doors to foreign investment in the late 1970s, Hong Kong 
companies have poured an estimated $74 billion into the country through 1992, 
according to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Lured by factory wages that are about half as much as those in the colony, 
Hong Kong textile mills, electronic manufacturers, toy makers and other firms 
have moved into China. As a result, about 80% of the estimated $134 billion in 
Hong Kong's 1992 exports originated primarily in China, and about half the 
companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange have significant Chinese 
operations or sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Chinese economy will slow down, the Hong Kong economy will also slow 
down," said Richard Drobnick, director of the International Business Education 
& Research Program at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Many foreign companies have established headquarters in Hong Kong to take 
advantage of its experience and guanxi -- "connections" -- that play a crucial 
role in China's business dealings. Guanxi , said Wei Li, "can get you a factory 
built, a long-term contract with a supplier . . . cheap loans from Chinese 
banks." 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong's growing investment in China has altered the colony's economic 
landscape: Blue-collar industries have declined while finance and services have 
grown.  
</P>
<P>
 "It has become the services and management center of southern China," said 
Richard Farrell, director of Guinness Flight, a London-based investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, China ranks as Hong Kong's biggest source of foreign investment. By 
1992, Chinese investment in Hong Kong totaled $12 billion to $13 billion and 
was growing fast, according to economic statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chinese and other foreign investors are fearful about a possible collapse 
of the territory's overheated real estate market. Those fears have spread to 
the Hong Kong stock market, which has declined 20% since January as real estate 
stocks nose-dived. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see that property-related stocks are still substantially overvalued and 
may go down," said Daniel J. Duane, senior portfolio manger at Prudential 
Mutual Funds. "If they go down, they will drag the whole market down with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Disputes between British and Chinese officials have also hampered projects 
considered vital to Hong Kong's role as a center for global trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of a new shipping terminal for container ships, for example, has 
reportedly been delayed by at least 1 1/2 years because of China's reluctance 
to approve the project. The construction of the new airport has also been 
threatened with delays as the British and Chinese argue over financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong needs to expand both facilities if it "is going to continue to be a 
financial and service center," said Meocre Li of Arthur Andersen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Hong Kong needs to improve its expertise in high technology, 
which lags far behind those in many neighboring countries, such as Japan, 
Taiwan and South Korea, economic observers say. China has a large appetite for 
high technology, but it must go elsewhere for such expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the sad part," Li said of Hong Kong's limited number of colleges and 
research centers. "They have to upgrade . . . in order to compete in the world 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 2 1/2 years 
ago is a badly needed investment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong's stature as a gateway to China is also being challenged by the rise 
of Shanghai, Canton and other Chinese industrial centers. Increasingly, Western 
companies are dealing with Shanghai-based firms and bypassing Hong Kong 
middlemen. Ironically, many Shanghai entrepreneurs fled to Hong Kong in 1949 in 
the wake of communist rule and helped build the colony's postwar industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are willing to pay a premium at the moment . . . for being in Hong 
Kong," Duane said. But what happens, he said, "if everyone wakes up one day and 
realizes that there is an alternative to Hong Kong? That's the big mystery for 
the market." A Bad Year 
</P>
<P>
 The Hong Kong stock market, one of the world's most active, has declined this 
year, mostly because many listed companies are heavily involved in Hong Kong's 
inflated property market. Weekly closes for the Hang Seng index, except latest: 
Wednesday: 9,532.35, up 170.03

CONVERSION'S STOCKS TUMBLE AFTER DELISTING; WALL STREET: AMEX SAYS ONLY THAT 
'THEY DID NOT COMPLY WITH OUR . . . DISCLOSURE POLICIES.' 
</P>

 Stock of Pasadena-based Conversion Industries and several of its affiliated 
companies plummeted Wednesday after the American Stock Exchange said it plans 
to delist Conversion and its part-owned Beta Well Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amex, citing unspecified disclosure problems, halted trading in Conversion 
and in Beta on Tuesday, after making its delisting decision. 
</P>
<P>
 However, both stocks traded in the over-the-counter market Wednesday, where 
Conversion tumbled $1.19 to close at $1.38, and Beta plunged $4 to finish at 
$1.75. 
</P>
<P>
 An Amex spokeswoman in New York would not say why the exchange is seeking to 
delist the stocks other than that "they did not comply with our listing 
agreement and disclosure policies." 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion, which owns 8.6% of Beta, declined to comment, although a spokesman 
said the firm will request an Amex hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amex decision to jettison the stocks is a rarity, marking the first such 
move by the exchange since 1971. It casts another shadow over Conversion and 
Beta, both of which have stirred controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion, formed in 1983 as a Canadian energy firm, became a merchant 
banking operation in 1991. It purchases stakes in small companies, then helps 
take them public in stock offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Conversion has been under scrutiny for its ties to Tamaron Investments, a 
Colorado brokerage that has had run-ins with securities regulators. Conversion 
stock has tumbled from $33.25 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Beta was formed in 1988 to provide oil field services. Its stock surged as 
high as $20 in 1993, in part on excitement over Russian projects the firm said 
it was developing. But the stock has plunged this year as revenue has dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of other Conversion spinoffs also fell Wednesday. On the Amex, North 
American Recycling slid 31 cents to $2, CVD Financial slumped 50 cents to 
$1.125 and Statordyne lost 19 cents to $1.31.

RECORD CROPS FORECAST FOR CORN, SOYBEANS; AGRICULTURE: THE GOVERNMENT PREDICTS 
A STUNNING REBOUND FROM 1993'S FLOODS AND DROUGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's farmers are posting a stunning recovery from last year's floods 
and drought, harvesting record crops of corn and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Agriculture Department on Wednesday forecast the corn harvest at 9.6 
billion bushels and soybeans at 2.46 billion bushels. Nearly ideal weather 
throughout the Midwest caused both crops to mature early and stay hardy. 
</P>
<P>
 The bumper crops will knock down prices received by farmers, raising the 
prospect of higher government spending to maintain farm income. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bulging bins should have no major effect on consumer prices, because 
raw goods make up such a small part of retail prices. By keeping a lid on 
animal feed costs, the heavy harvest should hold down already-low meat prices, 
said Paul T. Prentice, president of Farm Sector Economics in Colorado Springs, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the gloomier price picture, some growers are pleased at the bounty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives you a good feeling to know you've got a good crop out there," said 
Scott Durbin, who grows corn and soybeans on 750 acres near Owaneco in 
south-central Illinois. "It may not be worth what you'd like for it to be, but 
at least, by golly, you're going to have a crop out there to harvest." 
</P>
<P>
 Durbin was reporting some corn yields in excess of 200 bushels an acre and 
soybeans at 50 bushels or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields like that in a major growing state such as Illinois helped push the 
nation's forecast yields to a record 133.8 bushels of corn per acre and 40.5 
bushels for soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
 In parts of the Corn Belt, some grain was already being piled on the ground 
because elevators are full to bursting, said Rod Gangwish, a Shelton, Neb., 
farmer and president of the National Corn Growers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But the self-professed optimist says it's often better to have more to sell 
cheap than too little at a higher price. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's report, based on Oct. 1 field conditions, marks the second 
straight month the department has raised its forecast. Harvest is still under 
way for both crops. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous record corn crop was 9.48 billion bushels in 1992. For soybeans, 
the record was 2.26 billion bushels in 1979.

TIMES MIRROR SETTLES SUITS OVER CABLE DEAL; MEDIA: PUBLISHER OF LOS ANGELES 
TIMES OFFERS INVESTORS HIGHER DIVIDENDS FOR UP TO THREE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer

<P>
 Times Mirror Co. announced an agreement Wednesday to settle all shareholder 
lawsuits that challenged the proposed sale of its cable television business to 
Cox Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the settlement, which faces court approval, Times Mirror will 
offer investors an opportunity to earn higher dividends for up to three years 
by exchanging new shares of common stock for a new series of preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Times Mirror signed a definitive agreement to sell its cable 
operation in a $2.3-billion transaction that would form a new company 
controlled by Cox. Times Mirror's stockholders, excluding trusts of the 
company's founding Chandler family, would own about 20% of the new entity while 
retaining their common stock of Times Mirror, a consumer and professional 
information company that publishes the Los Angeles Times and several other 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 In connection with the deal, Times Mirror had announced plans to cut its 
dividend by up to 80%. The company also said the Chandler trusts, which have 
54% voting control of Times Mirror, would receive a new preferred stock with a 
fixed dividend that would insulate the trusts from the reduced payout on the 
common shares. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That gave rise to the stockholders' suits, which alleged that the transaction 
favored the trusts at the expense of other holders. The proposed settlement 
would not change the terms received by the trusts. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, Times Mirror's other shareholders would have the option 
to swap their Times Mirror common stock on a 1-for-1 basis for new securities 
called "mandatory conversion preferred stock," or exchange-preferred. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange-preferred would carry a minimum annual dividend yield of 6.5% and 
would convert back to one share of common after three years. In the meantime, 
the exchange-preferred is expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange, but 
Times Mirror would also have the right to redeem the stock before the three 
years is up. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement also calls for Times Mirror to pay up to $6 million for the 
shareholders' legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror's common stock rose 25 cents a share to $31.875 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading Wednesday.

 SEC to Unveil Steps to Simplify Mutual Fund Prospectuses: Securities and 
Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt, as reported, will also announce 
today a public education program designed to promote greater understanding by 
the public of the risks and rewards of personal investing.As part of the 
program, the SEC will publish a brochure outlining the important sections to 
read in mutual fund prospectuses, the documents used to describe funds' 
objectives and risks. The material will describe some of the risks, an SEC 
spokesman said. Officials declined to comment on the specific steps that will 
be taken to simplify fund prospectuses. But Levitt has said in the past that he 
wants to reduce the amount of legalese.

NO INDICTMENT SOUGHT IN PRUDENTIAL DEBACLE; WALL STREET: SOURCES SAY THAT 
BROKERAGE WON'T FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES, BUT EXECUTIVES STILL MAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors have decided not to seek an indictment of Prudential 
Securities, the Wall Street brokerage that has been under criminal 
investigation for more than a year in connection with sales of $8 billion in 
limited partnerships that allegedly defrauded thousands of small investors, 
sources confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 People close to discussions between Prudential and the government said the 
troubled brokerage has been told no indictment will be returned -- provided 
there are no new complaints of serious wrongdoing by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, which has conducted the 
investigation, declined to comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said that the decision not to prosecute, first reported Wednesday 
by the Wall Street Journal, does not cover all the current or former Prudential 
executives and other individuals who also have been under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission is understood to be 
continuing civil investigations of former Prudential executives. The firm 
itself settled SEC civil charges last year, agreeing to pay a fine and an 
open-ended amount of restitution to customers. To date, Prudential has paid out 
more than $1 billion in settlements, judgments and legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerage firm, a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, would neither 
confirm nor deny on Wednesday that it had been told that it will not face 
criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are currently engaged in constructive discussions with the U.S. attorney's 
office," the parent company said in a written statement. "We are confident that 
Prudential Securities will emerge as a stronger organization, well prepared to 
move forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without an indictment, however, Prudential Securities faces severe 
problems as a result of the partnership debacle. The firm has lost over $320 
million so far this year, in large part because of the continuing costs of the 
scandal. Over 1,000 brokers have left Prudential this year, including many of 
its top producers, and the firm has had to offer unusually generous 
compensation packages to lure new brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Prudential Securities spokesman Charles Perkins said the firm's work 
force has stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within current market conditions we have a very strong business," he said. 
Prudential Insurance on Wednesday denied ongoing speculation that the 
subsidiary might be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear whether the decision not to prosecute was made by 
Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, or by higher level Justice 
Department officials in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Several individuals who long have been closely involved in lawsuits against 
Prudential speculated that the government is reluctant to take steps that might 
lead to the firm going out of business, at the potential cost of 18,300 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Van Houmissen of Escondido, who heads a group of former Prudential 
customers seeking compensation from the firm, said he was disappointed, if not 
surprised, that the firm will not be indicted. "I just don't think it's 
possible in our political system for someone with that leverage to get nailed 
as hard as they should be nailed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the early 1980s through about 1991, Prudential heavily promoted highly 
risky limited partnership investments in real estate, oil and gas and other 
ventures to retirees and other small investors, contending that they were safe 
investments comparable to bank certificates of deposit. Most investors lost 
much of the money they put into the deals.

 MEXICAN STOCKS

<P>
 * Mexican stocks posted their biggest one-day gain Wednesday since mid-July 
amid expectations of healthy third-quarter earnings. The Bolsa index soared 
2.82% to close at 2,740.82 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysts also said the results of today's auction of government securities 
encouraged investors. Yields on treasury bills, or cetes, rose between seven 
and 37 basis points, less than expected. Analysts had expected interest rates 
to rise to between 14% and 16% after the Sept. 28 assassination of Jose 
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, a top official at the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party and a pro-reform politician.

 After the turmoil under the leadership of deposed Marxist dictator Mengistu 
Haile Mariam and the ravages of famine, the economy has had a bumpy ride. It 
now appears to be showing some growth. Inflation and a relatively high foreign 
debt remain serious problems, however.

 CBS Earnings Down 51%: The New York-based broadcasting company said 
third-quarter earnings fell as the loss of professional football and baseball 
games reduced advertising revenue.The company said ad revenue was 4% lower 
without those telecasts. It also said a onetime gain from the settlement of a 
lawsuit with Viacom Inc. inflated results in the year-earlier quarter. In 
addition, CBS said a higher tax rate hurt earnings this year. CBS fell $9.50 to 
$329.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. Third-quarter net income fell 
to $58.4 million, or 77 cents a share, from $118.2 million, or $1.48 a share, a 
year earlier.

front-runner to head America's second-largest auto maker, said he will retire 
at year's end.Gilmour, 60, joined Ford Motor Co. in 1960 as a financial analyst 
and moved up the ranks. He was appointed vice chairman in 1992. No replacement 
was named. Executives now reporting to Gilmour will report to Chairman Alex 
Trotman after the retirement. Trotman was named Ford chairman in October, 1993,

 Consumer Groups OK Low-Emission Vehicle Plans: Two of California's 
investor-owned utilities have reached a compromise with Toward Utility Rate 
Normalization and Utility Consumers Action Network over the utilities' 
proposals to support low-emission vehicles. The agreement was filed with the 
California Public Utilities Commission.California utilities have been required 
to submit plans to build refueling stations and to make other infrastructure 
improvements to prepare for auto makers' lower-emission cars, mandated by the 
state Air Resources Board. The consumer groups had objected to the way 
ratepayers would have been required to pay for the improvements. Under the 
compromise, also approved by the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
and the Southern California Assn. of Governments, these costs will be paid back 
to utility consumers by the sixth year of the plans.

unlimited access to most of the network. By evening, America Online, which also 
charges $9.95 for a basic five-hour service, had said it would reduce its rate 
for additional hours from $3.50 to $2.95.

 PaineWebber Reportedly Eyeing Full Kidder Bid: PaineWebber Group Inc. held 
talks last week to acquire all of Kidder, Peabody & Co., PaineWebber employees 
familiar with the negotiations said.The employees, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity, said the preliminary discussions were broader than those held 
earlier this month on buying only Kidder's brokerage unit. PaineWebber, the 
nation's fifth-largest securities firm, would increase its staff of brokers, 
traders and bankers by purchasing Kidder. General Electric Co., Kidder's 
parent, is trying to sell its brokerage unit, which has lost more than $300 
million this year amid declines in the bond market and a bond trading scandal.

 Bankers Trust Says It Still Leads in Derivatives: The company said it has not 
lost the position despite the well-publicized losses of some clients.Gibson 
Greetings Inc., which alleges it suffered severe losses in derivatives trading, 
filed a lawsuit against Bankers Trust New York Corp. in September. Gibson 
claims Bankers Trust was to blame for losses it suffered on interest rate 
swaps. Bankers Trust responded that Gibson's losses resulted from the greeting 
card company knowingly taking positions on the movements of interest rates. 
Another Cincinnati-based client, Procter & Gamble Co., has said it might sue 
the bank over derivatives losses this year. P&G took a $102-million charge to 
earnings in the first quarter for losses on swaps.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; MEXICAN STOCKS RALLY; WALL ST. AWAITS REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexican stocks posted their biggest one-day gain since mid-July on Wednesday, 
while U.S. stock and bond markets drifted, awaiting key economic reports due 
today and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles County made history with the largest-ever taxable muni 
bond issue, totaling nearly $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Among world stock markets, the Mexico City market stole the spotlight, as the 
Bolsa index soared 75.23 points, or 2.8%, to 2,740.82. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said investors were reacting to prospects for healthy third-quarter 
earnings reports from Mexican companies -- just as optimism about U.S. 
corporate earnings sparked a strong Wall Street rally earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican stocks also attracted bargain hunters who have been waiting for the 
market to stop declining. The Bolsa hit seven-week lows last week in the wake 
of the September assassination of a key ruling party official. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average eased 1.68 points to 3,875.15 
after surging 101 points in the three prior sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading was moderate at 270 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, 
where losers edged winners by 11 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said investors turned cautious Wednesday ahead of several important 
economic reports that the government will issue today and Friday. Today, the 
Labor Department reports on wholesale inflation in September. On Friday, 
investors will see reports on consumer inflation, industrial production and 
retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists are expecting wholesale inflation to show a 0.1% to 0.2% rise; the 
consumer inflation rise is expected to be about 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors who stayed sidelined on Wednesday may be worried that the inflation 
numbers will come in above expectations, which could trigger renewed fears that 
the Federal Reserve Board will tighten credit again. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, yields inched up Wednesday in a sign of investor 
nervousness. The 30-year Treasury bond yield rose to 7.90% from 7.86% Tuesday. 
Yields have been hovering at 28-month highs. 
</P>
<P>
 William LeFevre, senior analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, said he did not 
expect that economic numbers will be strong enough to rattle the markets. If 
that's the case, he said, investors will be freer to continue to focus on 
corporate earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
 But Michael Metz, analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., said stocks may already have 
discounted any good news in the next batch of economic reports. "The market has 
worked itself into a no-win situation," Metz said. "If the numbers are good, 
the market will be flat, and if not, the market will get hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Quarterly earnings reports continued to move stocks. Winners included 
Charles Schwab, up 1 1/8 to 32; Federal National Mortgage, up 1/4 to 78 3/8, 
and Molex, up 2 to 42 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Among stocks falling on earnings news, Weyerhaeuser lost 1 to 41 1/2, 
Consolidated Papers dropped 1 1/4 to 49 and CBS fell 9 1/2 to 329 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many tech issues continued to rally, including Apple, up 2 1/2 to 42 1/8; 
IBM, up 1 1/2 to 73 1/8; Peoplesoft, up 3 5/8 to 53 1/4, and Compaq, up 1 1/8 
to 35 7/8. But Advanced Micro Devices slumped 1 1/8 to 23 1/2 after losing a 
round in its patent suit with Intel. Intel was off 3/4 to 59 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some railroad stocks rose after Lehman Bros. upgraded the stocks. CSX gained 
7/8 to 68 7/8 after Lehman raised it to "buy" from "outperform." Also, 
Burlington Northern rose 3/4 to 51 and Conrail added 3/4 to 51 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, Hilton rose 1 3/4 to 59 1/2 after Salomon Bros. 
upgraded the stock to "buy." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, chicken restaurant chain Koo Koo Roo dropped 7/16 to 7 5/16, after it 
announced Tuesday that a planned $55-million cash infusion from an investment 
group had been called off. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new-issues market, Southland-based retailer Strouds sold 3.3 million 
shares to the public at 12 1/2 each. The stock closed at 13 1/8 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 * In overseas trading, Tokyo's Nikkei average closed above 20,000 for the 
first time since Sept. 13, rising 268.26 points to 20,089.72. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, bullish British inflation news helped the FTSE 100 index jump 27.5 
points to 3,100.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt shares, which have rallied powerfully in recent days, calmed on 
Wednesday. The DAX index added 6.51 points to 2,077.57. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Korea, the composite index rose 11 points to an all-time high of 
1,089.66, after Finance Minister Park Jai Yoon suggested the government may 
embark on faster financial deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the U.S. municipal bond market, Los Angeles County sold $1.965 billion of 
taxable long-term bonds, the largest such muni offering in history. The 
proceeds from the complex deal are being used to cover the unfunded portion of 
the county's future employee retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The special bonds, the interest on which is federally taxable but not taxed by 
California, were mainly marketed to corporate and institutional buyers rather 
than to individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Treasury bond market, the government issued a rare early-redemption 
notice. The 25-year T-bonds issued Feb. 18, 1975 and paying 7 7/8% interest 
were set to mature Feb. 15, 2000, but now will be "called" next Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury estimated it can save $25 million to $35 million by calling the 
bonds and replacing them with lower-yielding bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Treasury bonds cannot be called before maturity.

TRAVELERS COULD GET $400 MILLION IN COUPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About $400 million worth of discount airline coupons awarded in a price-fixing 
suit could be distributed to travelers in December if a judge OKs a final 
report on the processing of claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers plan in the next few days to submit to U.S. District Judge Marvin H. 
Shoob a report on the yearlong processing of 4.3 million claims for the 
coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will ask for permission to print them and mail them out," said Ann Yahner, 
one of the attorneys representing travelers in the class-action case. "Our hope 
is that once the judge issues approval, we can get the certificates printed and 
mailed in the month of December." 
</P>
<P>
 Distribution of the coupons would be the final chapter in a suit filed in 1990 
against the nation's major airlines, accusing them of using a computerized 
reservations system to mutually raise ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The airlines denied wrongdoing but agreed last year to a $458-million 
settlement that includes the coupons as well as attorney fees and court costs. 
Shoob approved the settlement in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Named in the suit were American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air 
Lines, Midway Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Pan American World Airways, Trans 
World Airlines, United Airlines and USAir. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Pan Am and Midway have since gone out of business, people who 
bought tickets from them were still eligible to receive the discount 
certificates for use on the other carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was brought on behalf of anyone who bought tickets on the defendant 
airlines between Jan. 1, 1988, and June 30, 1992, for travel through 34 
domestic hubs. It was estimated that included about 12 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the settlement, two auditing firms have been reviewing the claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Yahner said she does not know how many claims were approved, though the figure 
will be included in the report to Shoob. 
</P>
<P>
 She said about 186,000 claims were duplicates and have been recommended for 
rejection. Some were denied because the claimant bought tickets on an airline 
not included in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who purchased five or more tickets during the period or took trips 
totaling $2,500 or more will be awarded coupons worth up to 10% of the cost of 
the original tickets.

ARE INCLUDED ON MAGAZINE'S '500 FASTEST-GROWING' LIST. 
</P>

<P>
 The 500 fastest-growing private U.S. companies saw sales shoot up to more than 
$7 billion last year from just $541 million in 1989, Inc. magazine said in an 
annual survey released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Over that period, the companies also created close to 47,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the head of the pack were booming telecommunications and computer 
networking companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Inc. said the South is home to nearly a third of the growth companies. 
California is the No. 1 entrepreneurial state, home to 73 companies on the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 The fastest-growing company was Object Design, a computer software firm based 
in Burlington, Mass., with sales growing at a staggering 23,376% between 1989 
and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Object Design, which was founded in 1988, had sales of $105,000 and eight 
employees in its first year. By 1993, it had 18 offices around the world, 253 
employees and annual sales of $24.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine said CardMember Publishing was the second-fastest-growing firm. 
The Stamford, Conn.-based provider of services for credit card holders achieved 
a five-year growth rate of 21,111%. 
</P>
<P>
 Rasna, a San Jose company that sells computer-aided software for mechanical 
engineers, was third, with sales soaring 15,628%. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten other companies registered a growth rate of more than 10,000%, the 
magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the company at the bottom of the list, Manufacturing Modes, which makes 
plastic, metal and electronic products, came in with a booming 523% sales 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Inc. said a poll of chief executives on the list showed that more than 50% of 
them have started more than one business venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the group, 28.6% have had businesses fail and 41% have sold businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The South, with 165 companies, is most favored by the chief executives. The 
region had 145 of the companies five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The West is second with 123 companies, compared to 120 in 1989. The Northeast 
follows with 110 firms, down from its 1989 tally of 124. The Midwest trailed 
with 102 companies, down nine from 1989's level. 
</P>
<P>
 After California, Florida had the greatest number of growth companies at 35, 
followed by 33 in Massachusetts, 25 in Texas and Virginia and 24 in New York.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: SPOTLIGHT ON HONG KONG; THE HONG KONG ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The British colony has long been a thriving free market economy, which has 
prompted some worries about how the pending takeove by China will impact on one 
of Asia's largest economies. Under an agreement signed with the British in 
1984, the colony in 1997 reverts to Beijing control after 99 years of British 
rule. THE ECONOMY: 
</P>
<P>
 With limited national resources, Hong Kong depends on imports for virtually 
all of its requirements, including raw materials, food and other consumer goods 
and fuel. But Hong Kong's emergence as a world financial center has contributed 
to steady growth in the colony's Gross Domestic Product, estimated at about 
$127.2 billion for 1994. Real GDP per capita for 1994 is about $10,855. 
Inflation, though still below double digits, has been higher than most 
industrialized nations, largely because of increases in property values. 
SERVICES: 
</P>
<P>
 Largely due to Hong Kong's role as a major internationl financial center, 
services account for about three quarters of Hong Kong's GDP. The territory 
houses numerous domestic and foreign financial services companies, including 
banks, insurers, brokerages and investment concerns that play an important role 
in the emerging stock markets in Asia. Transportation and shipping are also 
major service industries. TOURISM: 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism is the third largest foreign exchange earner and has grown rapidly in 
the past decade. In 1992, the number of tourists increased 16% and earnings 
rose nearly 22%. Visitors come mainly from Taiwan, Japan and Southeast Asia. 
LABOR FORCE: 
</P>
<P>
 With some six million people live in an area of just over over 400 square 
miles, Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated regions in the world. 
Birth rates are moderately low, with more than 70% of the population between 
the age of 15 and 64. Some 2.7 million people are in the work force. Despite 
the lack of a minimum wage law, average labor costs are second only to Japan 
among Asian economies and skilled labor is in short supply. Real wages rose 
about 1.9% in 1993. There, however, is abundant unskilled labor, in part 
because of extensive illegal immigration from China and Vietnam. TRADE: 
</P>
<P>
 Because of limited natural resources, Hong Kong relies heavily on imports for 
its manufacturing and consumer goods, amassing an expected $4.7 billion trade 
deficit this year. Hong Kong's principal imports are food, chemicals, textiles 
and machinery while it exports mostly clothing, electrical machinery and data 
processing equipment. It's principal trading partner is China, which relies on 
Hong Kong for reexports in addition to the regular trade that takes place 
between the two. Other major trading partners are Japan and the United States. 
TRANSPORTATION: 
</P>
<P>
 The government has imposed rules to strictly limit private ownership of 
automobiles because of the limitations of the crowded territories roadways. As 
a result, car ownership is extremely low compared to other Asian cities. But 
has an elaborate system of public transportation. The international airport and 
a magnificent natural harbor provide many links to most areas of the world. 
AGRICULTURE: 
</P>
<P>
 With only seven percent of Hong Kong's land arable, agriculture amounts to 
less than one percent of GDP. The territory relies on imports for most of its 
food, although it does produce some rice, vegetables, livestock and flowers.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL: SPOTLIGHT ON HONG KONG; A WESTERN 
CITY-STATE IN THE HEART OF ASIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For business travelers, Hong Kong is both exotic and familiar. The British 
crown colony, which will revert to Chinese rule in 1997, is both an ultramodern 
center of commerce with an exploding economy and a traditional Asian country 
with Old World ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for travelers is that despite the dense population, it is fairly 
easy to travel and do business in Hong Kong, which is the capital city of the 
colony.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fun city to be in," said Dwynn Helms, a House of Fabrics buyer in Los 
Angeles who travels to Hong Kong about twice a year. With stores and showrooms 
open late and sometimes on weekends, "you can do business seven days a week if 
you want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Entry requirements: To travel to Hong Kong, you need a passport and proof of 
return or onward transportation, but you don't need a visa for stays of 30 days 
or less. For more information, contact the British Consulate in Los Angeles at 
(310) 477-3322.  
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Kai Tak Airport, which is on the Kowloon side of the harbor 
across from Hong Kong Island, is about 20 minutes from the city of Kowloon and 
40 minutes from hotels across the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Clean and fast buses that leave every 15 minutes will get you from the airport 
to your hotel. Or you can take a cab, which will be more expensive. Cab fare to 
the Hong Kong side runs about $10; the shuttle costs between $2 and $3, said 
Winchell Cheung, marketing officer for the Hong Kong Trade and Development 
Council in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Getting around: Most travelers find they don't need to rent a car in Hong Kong 
because it is a small area with a well-developed public transportation system.  
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, traffic can be a problem," said Albert Chen, general manager of 
Irvine-based Potrans, who travels frequently in Asia.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the easiest ways to get around is underground. "The subway system is 
very sophisticated, convenient and inexpensive," Chen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no graffiti and no litter," Helms said. "You can buy a multi-ride 
pass and get almost anywhere you need to go, including outlying areas."  
</P>
<P>
 It is also easy to catch a minibus, which seats 10 to 15 people and will stop 
anywhere you want along its route, Chen said. Taxis are also plentiful and not 
terribly expensive, because most Hong Kong destinations are close together, he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Language: In Hong Kong and Kowloon, English is usually spoken in hotels, Helms 
said. In the more outlying areas, English becomes less common. If you are 
traveling to a distant location by subway and will need to get a bus or taxi to 
your final destination, get instructions written in Chinese to present to the 
driver before you leave, Helms said. The concierges at most business-class 
hotels will be able to assist with directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, before you leave, be able to recognize the name of your destination and 
the stop where you will get off. Although many people speak English, most signs 
are not in English, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tipping: As in many Pacific Rim countries, tipping is not expected in 
restaurants and cabs, but it is appreciated, Chen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money: You can exchange U.S. dollars for Hong Kong dollars at hotels and 
private money changers, but banks will provide the best rate. Hotels are 
convenient, even if the rates are not as good. Always ask about fees in 
addition to the exchange rate. And be wary of private exchange booths along the 
roadway, especially if they advertise low fees, because they often make up for 
it with poor rates, Chen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although traveler's checks are accepted in many places, using them to make 
purchases will end up costing you more because of poor exchange rates. It's 
better to change them into local currency first. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety: As in any dense metropolitan area, you need to be cautious. Because 
Hong Kong has so many tourists, police and security officers patrol the streets 
quite heavily, Chen said: "They want people to feel safe." According to the 
U.S. State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington, serious crime 
is not a problem for most travelers in Hong Kong, but pickpocketing is fairly 
common. 
</P>
<P>
 If your passport is lost or stolen, make sure you report it to both the local

EXECUTIVE TRAVEL: SPOTLIGHT ON HONG KONG; WHEN DOING BUSINESS THERE . . .

 Though British influences are evident in government and commerce, business 
dealings also reflect the traditions of Hong Kong's 98%-Chinese population. DO 
</P>
<P>
 * Exchange business cards. They are always exchanged upon introduction, and 
both hands should be used when giving and receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use courtesy titles until the person you are addressing suggests an 
alternate form. Also be aware that it is Chinese tradition for the surname to 
appear first. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be prepared to deal with your contact's relatives, since most businesses are 
closely held family ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 * Try to resolve legal matters and disputes out of court, as preserving 
relationships and saving face is vital in Hong Kong. Although English common 
law forms the basis of the legal system in Hong Kong, some Chinese legal 
traditions are also employed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be prepared to do some business in languages other than English. English and 
Cantonese are official languages. The former is the most widely used in 
business, but Cantonese is commonly spoken in the Chinese community, and many 
in Hong Kong also speak Mandarin, which is the lingua franca in China. After 
1997, English will still be an official language among the executive, 
legislative and judicial authorities in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid overly aggressive or loud behavior. Control both positive and negative 
emotions. Physical contact is frowned upon. However, a brief handshake is 
common. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expect to spend a lot of time laying a foundation, building relationships 
and proving your capabilities.  
</P>
<P>
 * Be aware that most companies are run by a single, dominant executive with 
more top-down decision making than consensus building. As a result, business 
decisions are often made more quickly than in other Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be aware of the influence of ancient Chinese traditions. For example, a feng 
shui specialist may be consulted on the layout of an office, or an auspicious 
day may be chosen for the signing of a contract. DON'T 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't be late for appointments. Hong Kong executives expect promptness. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't use broad body gestures. Unless pointing to something specific on a 
document, use the whole hand to point and the hand with palm down to beckon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't respond to invitations over the phone. It is considered impolite. A 
formal written response is more appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't expect to get a lot done during the Chinese New Year in February, as 
many businesses close for as long as a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't expect to have to deal with Chinese officials immediately. But many 
executives are making informal contacts before the 1997 transition.

 Protection for Brokers: Real estate brokers can learn the latest ways to 
protect themselves when selling or buying commercial buildings at a Newport 
Beach seminar sponsored by the Society of Industrial and Office Realtors, a 
trade group in Orange County. With the real estate downturn prompting a rapid 
change of ownership in office and industrial projects, brokers sometimes are 
caught representing a client or tenant that no longer has an interest in the 
property. The seminar Wednesday in Newport Beach is designed to assist brokers 
in protecting themselves from liability.

INVESTORS ON ALERT FOR PLATINUM SOFTWARE RESULTS; FINANCE: QUARTERLY REPORT IS 
DUE SOON FROM COMPANY THAT RESTRUCTURED AFTER REVEALING THAT IT HAD MISSTATED 
REVENUE FOR TWO YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Platinum Software Corp., which underwent a drastic restructuring after 
revealing earlier this year that it had misstated its revenue, is preparing to 
release its quarterly results, and investors and analysts are on the alert to 
see how the company is doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they've stabilized," said William Shattuck, an analyst who follows 
Platinum for the Montgomery Securities brokerage in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "But just because they've got a game plan in order, it doesn't mean they're 
out of the woods," he said. "It just means they've made a lot of progress." 
</P>
<P>
 The accounting software company's top managers resigned in April after 
announcing that revenue over the previous two fiscal years had been overstated 
by more than $18.2 million. Platinum was subsequently hit with a shareholder 
lawsuit, which has since been settled, and a Securities and Exchange Commission 
investigation that is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmelo Santoro, a Platinum board member, was appointed acting chief executive 
officer on April 18 after founder and Chairman Gerald R. Blackie quit, along 
with four other top executives. Santoro later accepted the CEO position 
permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 The new managers, Santoro said, realized they needed to restructure to avoid 
bankruptcy. "We didn't have enough cash," he said. "We would have been out of 
business by August or September." 
</P>
<P>
 To recover, Platinum spun off some divisions and shrank its work force from 
about 800 to the current level of about 450, taking a $15-million restructuring 
charge in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials say they expect Platinum to be profitable for its current 
fiscal year, which began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 To do so, Santoro said Wednesday, the company needs $15 million in revenue 
each quarter. He projects that the company "will average above that figure." 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro and David Proctor, the company's chief operating officer, said they 
are changing Platinum's focus. Whereas the earlier management team's sales 
strategy had targeted large multinational corporations, Platinum is now 
developing a product aimed at mid-size companies with annual revenue of $20 
million to $500 million. Shipments of that product are to begin next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro said the company is also planning to offer a version of its software 
for smaller businesses that will run on Microsoft's popular Windows operating 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 A cash infusion of $13.8 million from investors led by two San Francisco 
venture-capital firms could help Platinum's product development. The group 
bought a stake in Platinum on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we saw Santoro come in, we thought that would be a basis for 
re-energizing the company, really solidifying its plans," said C. Richard 
Kramlich, managing general partner for one of the venture capital groups, New 
Enterprise Associates.

WESTERN DIGITAL REVENUE RISES 63% TO RECORD LEVEL FOR QUARTER

 Western Digital Corp. on Wednesday reported record revenue for its latest 
quarter, a pleasant surprise to Wall Street analysts who had expected sales of 
the company's computer products to be slow during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had strong profitability in both our microcomputer and our disk drive 
business," said Chuck Haggerty, Western Digital's chairman, president and chief 
executive officer. Microcomputer sales had lagged during the same quarter last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company saw a surge of sales in Europe. "So many European 
customers close up in the summer, but this year sales were great," Haggerty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based company said its revenue totaled $464.4 million for the first 
fiscal quarter, which ended Oct. 1. That was a 63% increase over revenue of 
$285.5 million for the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Profit was $34.7 million, or 70 cents a share. That contrasted with a loss of 
$5.1 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts cited an unusual confluence of positive factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "New products and the mix of products are better than last year," said Roxanne 
Googin, an analyst with the brokerage Gruntal & Co. in Los Angeles. "And they 
have been able to manufacture them more quickly than the competition without 
overproducing." 
</P>
<P>
 Western Digital's stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at 
$16.75 a share Wednesday, up $1. Strong Profitability 
</P>
<P>
 For the quarter ended Oct. 1, Western Digital reported revenue of $464.6 
million, a 63% increase from the same period a year earlier. Profit totaled 
$34.7 million, contrasted with a loss of $5.1 million a year earlier. Figures

 More Mortgages: The number of new home mortgages in Orange County increased 
31% through June of this year, compared to the same time last year, according 
to a real estate data company. In the 21 states surveyed, mortgage originations 
were up 25% because of a healthier housing market, said TRW REDI Property Data 
in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, 18,744 new mortgages were reported through June, compared to 
14,207 the previous year. In California, the number of home purchase mortgages 
increased 24.5% from the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initial indications are that a recent rise in mortgage rates has not had a 
significant negative impact on the housing market," said Nima Nattagh, an 
analyst with TRW REDI. The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage 
during the first half of the year was nearly 8%, slightly above the 7.58% rate 
recorded during the same period last year.

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; SURPLUS SPACE FROM DEFENSE CUTBACKS COULD CAUSE CITIES

 Unless the private sector and local governments come up with joint solutions, 
Orange County cities such as Fullerton that are targeted for defense cutbacks 
will face lingering real estate woes, according to a new study from Kenneth 
Leventhal & Co., the Los Angeles accounting firm. Fullerton is home of a 
350-acre facility for Hughes Aircraft Co., which last month announced the 
largest plant closure in Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
 Without solutions, millions of square feet of surplus office, industrial and 
manufacturing space vacated by the defense industry could remain idle for 
years. This would hurt local economies, according to the 38-page study, titled 
"Real Estate Strategies for a Changing Defense Industry."  
</P>
<P>
 "You need to have forward thinking and regional planning," said Michael Meyer, 
managing partner of the firm's Newport Beach office. "Cities need a workable 
plan for reuse of defense facilities that will enhance property values and 
bring in sales taxes or other revenues."

DISTRIBUTOR'S SUIT CLAIMS SPORTS SPECIALTIES BROKE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County distributor of sports caps made by Sports Specialties Inc. in 
Irvine has sued the company for $10 million, claiming that it has broken an 
exclusive distributorship agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit by Unlimited Specialty Products Inc. claims that the 16-year-old 
agreement was renewed in November, 1991, and that Sports Specialties, which 
later became a subsidiary of Nike Inc., began violating it in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Masters, Unlimited's founder and owner, said Wednesday that because of 
the dispute the company was forced into receivership by its bank in June. He 
said sales dried up after Sports Specialties began using other distributors in 
the states west of the Mississippi -- the territory where he said his company 
had exclusive rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Nike in Beaverton, Ore., could not be reached for comment. In 
Irvine, Sports Specialty's chief financial officer, Jess Meyers, said the 
company would not comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters said he was a Sports Specialties employee in 1978 when he started 
Unlimited with an agreement to be the cap maker's sole distributor in the 
western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of Sports Specialties products made up about 95% of Unlimited's peak 
annual sales of $9 million, he said. Since January, however, sales have all but 
disappeared. Masters said he has laid off all of his employees. "We had 17 
people once, and I laid off the last one on Friday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to discuss why he believes Sports Specialties started using other 
distributors less than two months after renewing his exclusivity agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine manufacturer, which pioneered the practice of licensing sports 
teams' names and logos to decorate merchandise, was negotiating to be acquired 
by Nike in January, 1992, when Masters' suit alleges the agreement was broken. 
In June of that year, the sports shoe and apparel giant bought Sports 
Specialties for more than $50 million.

 BARFIELD UNDER FIRE 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood High girls' basketball Coach Ellis Barfield will not be rehired in the 
aftermath of a fatal accident involving a player on his summer team. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracey Myricks, 11, was killed in the July 23 accident near Las Vegas when a 
van carrying Barfield and 12 players from the Lynwood Running Rebels flipped 
after Michelle Allen fell asleep while driving. Allen, an assistant at Lynwood 
who was also helping coach the Rebels, has been charged with involuntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip involving 18 players from the Lynwood Development League, ranging in 
age from 11 to 17, was not sanctioned by the Southern Section or the Lynwood 
Unified School District. Barfield has not been allowed to interact with Lynwood 
players since the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood Athletic Director Bill Lee asked for Barfield's resignation last week. 
Barfield, 29, a walk-on coach, refused and said he will fight the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 A Lynwood graduate, Barfield compiled a 62-2 record in two seasons and guided 
the Knights to the State Division I title in 1992-93 and the state championship 
game last season. MILESTONE 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Marijon Ancich earned his 200th victory at St. Paul High in the 
Swordsmen's 28-7 victory over Redlands Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was only one of many milestones for Ancich, 55, the winningest 
active coach in the Southern Section with a 32-year record of 266-76-8. Ancich, 
who coached at Tustin from 1984-92, has guided his teams to seven Southern 
Section title games, including five at St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Ancich guided the Swordsmen to a 7-4 record and a third-place finish 
in the Del Rey League after taking a program that was 8-14 the previous two 
years. St. Paul (5-0) plays Loyola in its league opener Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 200th victory was really a tribute," said Ancich, who has also served as 
an assistant coach at Cerritos College and Northern Arizona. "It makes you 
realize what it takes to survive all those years. All the time and effort to go 
year to year and to survive week after week with all the ups and downs is 
really difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been a more ups than downs for Ancich. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1967-77, St. Paul did not lose a game. The 1981 team was undefeated in 14 
games, set 30 school records and beat Colton in the Big Five Conference 
championship before nearly 30,000 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ancich said his most memorable game was a 7-3 victory over Mater Dei in 
1967 when the teams were competing in the Angeles League. The victory in the 
regular season finale secured a postseason berth and was the first of 14 
consecutive victories over the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mater Dei was the kingpin of Orange County," Ancich said. "It was a 
big-school victory and a crucial game to stay afloat. All my victories are 
separate and memorable, but this was one that really got our program going." 
DOUBLE TROUBLE 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback controversy at Bell Gardens High? 
</P>
<P>
 Not after the performance of Eddie Negrete and Guillermo Alvarez in Bell 
Gardens' 20-7 victory over El Rancho Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Negrete, a safety who replaced Alvarez at quarterback after the first game of 
the season, completed 10 of 15 passes for 184 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Alvarez found his niche at receiver after sitting out three games 
as the backup quarterback. He caught five passes for 147 yards, including 
touchdowns of 67 and 22 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a pretty neat deal," Bell Gardens Coach Dave Newell said. "It's a 
great lesson for the other players too. Guillermo thought he was lost in the 
shuffle but he came back and played a great game. We feel real good that we 
have found a spot he can be successful at." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens (2-3) leads the all-time series against El Rancho, 7-6, but the 
victory was only the second in the past six years against the former Whitmont 
League rival. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pumped up for this game, especially El Rancho," Alvarez said. 
"They're always our rival. Eddie came in and did a good job. It's his turn and 
I'm planning to play receiver from now on." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez, however, shouldn't rule out playing quarterback yet. Alvarez proved a 
qualified backup after Negrete suffered an ankle injury midway through the 
third quarter with the Lancers' clinging to a 14-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know all of us can play quarterback and we're not jealous of each other," 
Negrete said. "We're just here to help each other. We're a united team." 
LOOKING AHEAD 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Poly, La Mirada, St. Paul and St. Anthony are 5-0 halfway through 
the regular season. With league play beginning Friday for most schools, here's 
a look at the league races: 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTHERN SECTION 
</P>
<P>
 Division I 
</P>
<P>
 Del Rey -- St. Paul will have its hands full competing in a league that 
includes Bishop Amat, the nation's top-ranked team, and Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction -- 1. Bishop Amat; 2. Loyola; 3. St. Paul; 4. St. John Bosco; 5. 
Crespi; 6. Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore -- Long Beach Jordan, the preseason favorite, has been erratic. A third 
league title for Long Beach Poly is not out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction -- 1. Long Beach Poly; 2. Long Beach Wilson; 3. Long Beach Jordan; 
4. Lakewood; 5. Compton; 6. Millikan. 
</P>
<P>
 Division II 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel Valley -- Dominguez is better than its 2-2 record, but Paramount 
and Gahr are ready to step in if the Dons falter. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction -- 1. Dominguez; 2. Paramount; 3. Gahr; 4. Downey; 5. Warren; 6. 
Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Division III 
</P>
<P>
 Almont -- Alhambra has not won a league title in three decades but this could 
be the year for the Moors. Montebello, Bell Gardens and Schurr will also be in 
the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction -- 1. Alhambra; 2. Montebello; 3. Bell Gardens; 4. Schurr; 5. 
Keppel; 6. San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 Division VI 
</P>
<P>
 Del Rio -- La Serna (4-1) has been impressive, but strength of the Lancers' 
opponents is questioned. Whittier was also 2-3 at this point of the season last 
year, but reached the divisional final. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction -- 1. Whittier; 2. Santa Fe; 3. La Serna; 4. El Rancho; 5. 
California; 6. Pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Valley -- El Monte is the class of league, but Cerritos has a chance 
to earn a postseason berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction -- 1. El Monte; 2. Arroyo; 3. Cerritos; 4. South El Monte; 5. 
Rosemead; 6. Mountain View. 
</P>
<P>
 Division VIII 
</P>
<P>
 Suburban -- It's a rebuilding year for La Mirada, but the Matadors should not 
be challenged in their quest to repeat as league champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction -- 1. La Mirada; 2. Artesia; 3. Bellflower; 4. Glenn; 5. Norwalk; 
6. Mayfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Division IX 
</P>
<P>
 Camino Real -- Cantwell-Sacred Heart (2-3) has held its own against larger 
public schools, but so has the rest of the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction -- 1. St. Monica; 2. St. Anthony; 3. Verbum Dei; 4. Cantwell-Sacred 
Heart; 6. Harvard-Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Division X 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic -- No clear cut favorite. Valley Christian is one of five teams 
capable of winning the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction -- 1. Valley Christian; 2. Ontario Christian; 3. Calvary Chapel; 4. 
Whittier Christian; 5. Orange Lutheran; 6. Brethren Christian. CITY 
</P>
<P>
 Southeastern Conference -- South Gate has added the passing game to its 
traditional running attack en route to a 4-1 overall record and 3-0 conference 
mark. Fremont and Bell are the Rams' main adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction -- 1. Fremont; 2. South Gate; 3. Bell; 4. Garfield; 5. Locke, 6. 
Jefferson; 7. Huntington Park; 8. Jordan. COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 The Cerritos College football team will put its undefeated record on the line 
Saturday night against El Camino in a Mission Conference Northern Division game 
at home. Cerritos (4-0), the second-ranked team in the state, is coming off a 
34-19 victory over Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (4-1) visits Pasadena in a Northern Division game Saturday night. 
Neo Agoa connected with Joe Johnson on a four-yard pass with four minutes left 
to lift the Vikings to a 34-30 victory over San Diego Mesa last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton (3-1) plays Ventura in a Western State Conference game at home 
Saturday, trying to rebound from a 14-9 defeat to Hancock. Jimmy Perry passed 
for 161 yards and rushed for 36 in the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Hondo (1-4) dropped its fourth game in a row, falling to Desert, 42-28. 
Rio Hondo plays host to Citrus in a Foothill Conference game Saturday. KIRBY

HOTHOUSE JUNIOR HOCKEY; LEAGUE HOPES TO RAISE CROP OF HEARTY, TALENTED PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The man from Hemet brought his wife to the mountains for a romantic weekend to 
celebrate their wedding anniversary. Then they drove past the Ice Castle 
skating rink here and saw the sign out front. 
</P>
<P>
 Jr. Ducks vs. SJ Jr. Sharks  
</P>
<P>
 Hockey? With no NHL games on TV or at local arenas, the couple pulled into the 
parking lot to see what they had been missing since the lockout began Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The cozy bed and breakfast down the road would have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, they saw the opening faceoff of the Western States Hockey League, a 
six-team league for advanced players aged 17 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Thorne of Huntington Beach, the league commissioner and president of the 
Anaheim Junior Ducks, dropped the puck for the ceremonial faceoff, then the 
game began for real. The hitting was fierce, the passing crisp and the small 
stands were packed with family, friends and the curious. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon enough the Junior Ducks wrestled control from the Junior Sharks and 
turned a close-checking game into an 11-1 rout. The crowd, including the couple 
from Hemet, filed out of the rink happy the Ducks had won. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorne later fretted that the competition wasn't quite as good as he had 
hoped. After all, he started this league with the idea that standout players 
from Orange County wouldn't have to head out of state to play at a high level. 
</P>
<P>
 There have always been quality youth programs in Southern California, but 
never a good junior program for players aiming for a college or even pro 
career. Most of the players selected in the NHL draft each year are 
18-year-olds taken from junior leagues such as the Ontario Hockey League, the 
Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and the Western Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 Those three leagues are major junior A leagues. The Western States Hockey 
League is classified as junior B. Size and strength are the two major 
differences between the levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorne's son, Mike, advanced through area age-group teams, but suddenly had 
nowhere else to play once he reached the junior B level. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really needed a place for kids to play so they wouldn't have to go to the 
East or Midwest or Canada to play," Don Thorne said. "A lot of kids here are 
trying to attract attention to play at (NCAA) Division I schools." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Thorne contacted USA Hockey, which suggested he start his own league. 
With an assist from Rick Chartraw, a former 10-year NHL veteran who now works 
for the Disney Co., Thorne persuaded teams from Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, San 
Jose, Scottsdale, Ariz., and Ventura to join up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that's absolutely needed here," said Chartraw, who played 
three seasons with Kitchener of the OHL before joining the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids will take the next step (to the junior A level). Others will simply 
keep playing the game they love." 
</P>
<P>
 John McFarlane, a youth coach from Mission Viejo, was enlisted to coach the 
Junior Ducks and a crowd of 100 hopeful players turned out for tryouts. 
McFarlane cut the squad to 22, including 10 players from Orange County, and 
they began play last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a program similar to most in Canada. The Junior Ducks pay to play -- 
about $1,200 per season, which covers equipment and transportation to home and 
away games. Because ice time is scarce as well as expensive at Orange County 
rinks, the Junior Ducks call the Ice Castle home. 
</P>
<P>
 Most players live at home and continue attending school while playing on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "This league is something I didn't foresee when I first started coaching in 
California," said McFarlane, who also played junior hockey in Canada before 
coming to the Southland 10 years ago. "There were only 70 kids in the 
(youngest) program, now there are over 300. (Wayne) Gretzky did this magic down 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a couple of boys on our team with terrific potential." 
</P>
<P>
 David Ahn, a senior at Sunny Hills High, is one. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 6 when he first saw other youngsters playing at a rink at the Brea 
Mall. The rink is gone, but Ahn's passion lives on. 
</P>
<P>
 He played with and against Richard Park, a Rancho Palos Verdes resident who 
was drafted in June by the Pittsburgh Penguins after a 76-point season with the 
Belleville Bulls of the OHL. Ahn, a left wing, also played for McFarlane with a 
team called the Junior Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahn spent his junior year attending and playing hockey at Upper Canada 
College, a prestigious boarding school in Toronto. He quickly asserted himself, 
impressing the coaching staff with his passing and stick-handling. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, he was late to the Junior Ducks' season-opener because he was taking 
the SAT. He hopes to attend Harvard next fall, to study and play hockey. He 
hopes playing for the Junior Ducks helps land him a spot on the Harvard roster 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since this league formed I've been really happy," he said. "Up in Toronto, I 
was totally homesick. I definitely want to go to college. I love Harvard. I 
fell in love with it on a visit there." 
</P>
<P>
 Said his father, John: "This league is going to be a big help for California 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 After David's year in Toronto, a 90-minute drive to Blue Jay, near Lake 
Arrowhead, is only a small inconvenience for the Ahn family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a painful situation," John Ahn said. "My son was not ready to leave 
home, but he had (scholarship) offers to go to Toronto." 
</P>
<P>
 David could have returned to Toronto or joined an OHL or WHL team, according 
to his father, but decided to play for the Junior Ducks instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Ahn, Ryan Smith of Mission Viejo started playing at a young age. Smith, 
19, also has left California in search of better competition, only to return to 
become a Junior Duck. 
</P>
<P>
 A goaltender, Smith played last season with Jackson Hole, Wyo., of the 
Frontier League. He also has played in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 11, his coach asked for volunteers to play in goal. Smith decided 
to give it a try and has been in the nets ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never move back to forward," he said. "I like it back in the net. There's 
too much pressure. I like the pressure. All the glory or all the . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Smith hopes the Junior Ducks are a springboard to a junior A team next season. 
From there he hopes to be drafted by an NHL team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a long ways to go," he said. "Eventually, one day, I think I'll be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 If not? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll always play hockey, even if it's just playing beer league," he said. "It 
would be nice to make the NHL. It's been my goal since I first stepped on the 
ice." 
</P>
<P>
 The Junior Ducks simply offer another step toward the NHL for Smith.

AND NOW ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS VOTE; CAMPUSES: STUDENTS AT UCI AND CAL STATE 
FULLERTON REGISTER RECORD NUMBERS FOR THE NOV. 8 ELECTIONS AS A NATIONAL DRIVE 
KICKS OFF WITH AN EYE TO '96. ACTIVISTS SAY THE 18-TO-24S CAN BECOME A VERY 
POWERFUL BLOC.

<P>
 Jennifer Anastasoff, a lithe young woman on a mission, parked herself at the 
door to the UC Irvine concert and cornered the music-lovers, one by one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me, are you registered to vote?" she shouted above the music's blare. 
"People are playing for free in order that you register to vote. It's that 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 And this was not the only good time Anastasoff has had lately. 
</P>
<P>
 One night last week, she hung out at Kinko's in Irvine till 3 a.m., then spent 
the next two hours plastering "Rock the Vote" fliers all over campus. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the final hours before the Tuesday registration deadline, she roamed 
the campus with a friend hoping to snag procrastinators, at 2 a.m. stumbling 
upon a couple sitting beneath the stars and a sliver of a moon. It was an 
intimate scene, ripe with promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, are you registered to vote?" Anastasoff called out, shattering the 
scene. "It was over. The moment was over. Everyone seemed to be registered at 2 
in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not the coolest week on record, but it seems to have done the job. A 
small band of die-hards like Anastasoff, 20, have registered more than 600 new 
voters at UCI during the past week, 12 times the number netted in previous 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton student leaders also report increased voter registration 
this year. They're hoping it hints at a budding trend, one that will deliver 
more political power into the hands of young people. 
</P>
<P>
 The local push coincides with work being done at the national level. Today, 
Lead or Leave, a nonpartisan advocacy group for young people that Ross Perot 
helped start in 1992, will launch its Register Once campaign in Washington, 
D.C., with the goal of making it easier for college students to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 With some 325 schools representing 4 million students on board, spokesman 
Andrew Weinstein called it "the largest student campaign since the Vietnam 
War." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is to promote legislation that would remove obstacles to student 
voting, such as burdensome voting procedures and residency requirements. With 
such roadblocks shoved aside, the group's flier promises, students will be able 
to decide -- not just influence -- elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein said California colleges signed on early, including Cal State 
Fullerton and Chapman University in Orange.  
</P>
<P>
 "California's been ahead of the curve on this one," he said. "The students 
have been very organized there." 
</P>
<P>
 UCI leaders say they were so successful this year because they made it fun -- 
added Technicolor to the black-and-white process of registering to vote -- by 
doing such things as staging campus concerts and passing out free candy, audio 
tapes and nightclub tickets at voter registration booths. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it's still dull. But it gets students to the voting booth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The act itself isn't fun," said Anastasoff, a San Francisco transplant and 
poly sci major. "The way we sell it is that it takes five minutes out of you're 
life. We're trying to make it fun, to give a whole context to it." 
</P>
<P>
 And, yeah, they were relentless -- might as easily have been toting religious 
tracts as registration forms as they fanned out across campus over the past 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go to class, I always get the two people next to me," said Valerie Ho, 
director of external affairs, who ran the campaign and has been spending 10 to 
12 hours a day directing a crew of about 40 volunteers and compiling voter 
registration kits. 
</P>
<P>
 As the registration deadline approached, Ho, 20, even began hanging out at the 
campus pool hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pretend to be one of them," she said. "I sit down. I'll just be, 'Are you 
registered to vote?' " eyes widening casually. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsuspecting students stalled in ATM lines were pathetically easy prey. 
"They're in a good mood," Anastasoff said, "cause they're getting money." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Lowe, 24, Cal State Fullerton's student body president, describes a 
tamer routine at Cal State Fullerton, where students have been distracted by 
mid-terms. Still, he said, members of young Republican and Democratic groups 
"heavily solicited" potential voters, and student volunteers distributed 
get-out-the-vote buttons and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus registered considerably more new voters than in previous election 
years, Lowe said, although he did not have statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an overall sense of the importance to register, get involved and to 
play an active part in our own government," said Lowe, who was scheduled to 
leave Wednesday night to attend Lead or Leave's Register Once conference in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 That campaign will push for legislation that would link voter registration to 
class registration, ensure that college campuses provide voter registration and 
absentee ballot materials and establish voting booths on all campuses with more 
than 200 residential students. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lead or Leave is also marshaling a nationwide drive to get young adults 
to the polls in November, its main goal is to dramatically boost the turnout of 
young voters in the 1996 presidential election. This would not be, they 
caution, an automatic windfall for conservatives or liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 "College students are not very committed to either party," Lead or Leave's 
Weinstein said. "So it's difficult to assume it's automatically going to favor 
Democrats or Republicans. In fact, it will favor the party that does the most 
to win those loyalties." 
</P>
<P>
 Campus leaders say the unifying issue for California college students is 
rising student fees but, because so few students vote, politicians tend to 
ignore them. "We've been up in arms at UC about our fees," Anastasoff said, 
"And yet what's happened? Our fees keep getting raised." 
</P>
<P>
 Young adults would also like to kick around some issues many politicians would 
happily sidestep, such as revamping the welfare and Social Security systems and 
reducing the national deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Students say voters in their age group should catch a clue from their 
grandparents, who flex considerable muscle on Election Day. In the 1992 
election, the voter turnout for 18- to 24-year-olds was 42.8%, while a hefty 
70.1% of seniors appeared at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Senior citizens are being watched," Anastasoff said. "That's because they 
vote. We need to learn from them." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's Lowe is optimistic about making a change in the voting 
habits of young adults. "We've seen the beginning, and I'm predicting in the 
next year the 18 to 24 age group (will become) a very influential and powerful 
voting bloc." 
</P>
<P>
 But those supporting student voters say they have too many unnecessary hurdles 
to clear before they cast a ballot. For starters, every time a student switches 
dorms or apartments, he must re-register, even if he just moves next door, 
something most students don't realize. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the more serious problems, such as relinquishing a campus 
parking space long enough to get to a polling place, usually in a nearby 
neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you had to vote or park, people would probably take the parking," says 
Anastasoff, a realist who hopes to procure a shuttle to transport students to 
their waiting ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the real issue is convenience," Lowe agreed. "Many of our students 
are working; they have families; they are going to school full time, and they 
just really don't have the time to drop by, wait in line and vote." 
</P>

 On Wednesday night, UC Irvine students took a break to celebrate the victories 
of the past week at Metropolis nightclub across the street from campus. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reprieve would be temporary. And, Anastasoff said, even there she 
would work the crowd, reminding students that "It's fun! It's exciting!" to 
cast a ballot, so they'll be "in the mood" Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's time to call them and make sure they go out and vote," she said.

ANN CONWAY: BOLTON TAKES THE FIELD; THE SINGER, AT 'DREAMS' UNDERWRITING 
DINNER, MAKES GENEROUS DONATION HIMSELF 
</P>

<P>
 No one expected pop star Michael Bolton to use his platinum pipes at the Villa 
Nova restaurant in Newport Beach Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
 His publicist said he wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 But when three guests at the preview dinner offered to donate $7,500 each to 
benefit the Michael Bolton and Barry Bonds charity foundations, the curly 
haired singer belted out "When a Man Loves a Woman" and "Georgia on My Mind" at 
the piano bar and left most of the crowd so stunned they sat there with their 
dessert spoons hanging over their chocolate Grand Marnier souffle. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolton and his buddy Barry Bonds -- the San Francisco Giant outfielder who 
three times has been named most valuable player by the National League -- were 
on hand at the cozy bay-side eatery to announce plans of a joint fund-raiser at 
the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles on Nov 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first "Field of Dreams Awards" dinner and concert -- featuring Bolton, 
Kenny G, Gladys Knight, Dale Kristien, Tony Braxton and more -- will benefit 
the Michael Bolton Foundation and the Bonds Family Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolton's foundation supports women and children at risk. Bonds' foundation 
assists underprivileged children. 
</P>
<P>
 The star-packed salute, produced and directed by David Gest, will honor 
baseball legend Joe DiMaggio, comic great Sid Caesar, Columbia Records Chairman 
Don Ienner, record producer Kenny (Babyface) Edmonds, and actors Anthony Quinn 
and Maureen O'Hara. 
</P>
<P>
 "My foundation is a few years old now, but this is a new event, one that Barry 
and I are really excited about," said Bolton, sipping a sugar-laced cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barry and I thought the 'Dreams' benefit would be an appropriate thing to do, 
given the fact that we are both fortunate enough to be living our dreams," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to dive too far into my past to know that, until 1982 when 
things started to take off for me, I was working very hard to make ends meet. I 
know what it's like to struggle to take care of a family, get an eviction 
notice.  
</P>
<P>
 "And Barry and I know there are people out there who don't think their dream 
is anywhere within reach. We want to help them, inspire them." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bonds: "It's our way of recognizing people who have had their dreams 
become reality. Michael and I are on our field of dreams right now. We want to 
help children have the same opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who thought Bolton or Bonds would arrive sporting a Star Attitude were 
in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men mixed happily with guests -- who included Golden Age movie greats 
such as Jane Withers, Margaret O'Brien, Virginia Mayo and Anne Jeffreys -- 
shaking hands, chatting about the silent auction's movie memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 (Bolton, who generally eschews autograph-giving, even signed a Gerber T-shirt 
for 2-month-old Crystal LeFrance, daughter of Kelly Crean LeFrance -- daughter 
of Villa Nova owner Andy Crean and his wife, Charlene, dinner underwriters. "He 
said he'd do it because she was a baby ," Kelly said, beaming.) 
</P>
<P>
 In a private moment, Bolton said he and blond bombshell Nicolette Sheridan are 
back on track.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're together again," he said, flashing a small smile. "She's wacky and 
wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, when a man loves a woman.

CLOSET RX; SOME POINTED ADVICE ABOUT COLLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You may get hot around it, and a tight one may be one of the first indications 
that your diet's not working, but most of the time you probably don't put much 
thought into your collar -- just button it and go. However, there are some 
things to keep in mind when shopping for new shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't pay at least a little attention to collar fashions, you may find 
yourself looking behind the times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spread collar is hot right now," said John Shaw of Alex Sebastian for Men 
in Costa Mesa. "When it's buttoned, it has very little angle; it's almost 
horizontal." 
</P>
<P>
 If you've hung on to some dress shirts that you bought during the Carter 
Administration, you're in luck. The '70s-style revival in fashion is picking up 
steam and "point" collars -- lapels long, close together and pointed almost 
straight down -- are in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a 'sartorial' feel, and many designers are getting involved with this 
look again," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colored dress shirts with white collars have been around for years, but now 
there's a new twist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing them in other colors besides white," said Ziva Adams of Tie Rack 
in Santa Ana. "They can make a sharp addition to your wardrobe." 
</P>
<P>
 The button-down classic collar will probably be around well into the next 
millennium and is always correct (except as evening wear). Those who like the 
"secure" feeling of a button-down with a different look may want to try a 
"hidden" button-down. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep the collar down without the obvious button," Shaw said. "It's 
secured with a snap that's hidden from view. It creates a real neat look with a 
tie." 
</P>
<P>
 The collar bar is apparently drifting into obscurity again, which is probably 
why the tabbed collar is coming back. The tabs push in and keep the collar 
down, making the tie more prominent.  
</P>
<P>
 "Your tie knot should sit up," Adams said. "When looking at your profile, the 
knot should be leaning away, allowing the tie to hang straight down. The tabbed 
collar helps create that look." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, for most men, collar problems usually don't have as much to do with 
style as they do with fit. And if you find that your collars are getting 
tighter despite the fact that you haven't been indulging in a morning doughnut, 
take heart. It may not be your fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way many shirts are made, the collars tend to shrink with repeated 
washings," Adams said. "A tight collar's not necessarily an indication that 
you're gaining weight." 
</P>
<P>
 The "collar extender" may be a thrifty addition to your closet. It basically 
adds life to shirts by using a spring to widen the collar.  
</P>
<P>
 "It can't be seen, and it allows you some room to breathe," Adams said.

 Finally Extinct?

 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: In. Barney: Out. That's the word from the 
Halloween costume front lines, where Power Rangers are outselling the Purple 
One, who was No. 1 last year. "The only other costume for children that comes 
close is the Lion King," observes Alex Gerstenzang, zone merchant manager for 
Target stores. "We're talking about possibly carrying the Power Rangers costume 
beyond Halloween, because I see it as something kids would play in later." But, 
in contrast to the '93 Barney invasion, parents and kids will have a "tough 
time finding Power Ranger costumes this year," adds Gerstenzang, referring to 
limited supplies. However, kids might not find that as harsh to accept as this 
fact: The $14.99 ensemble includes a helmet that might look cool but makes it 
difficult to eat candy while trick-or-treating. Feminine Force 
</P>
<P>
 Being a woman doesn't have to mean wearing frills or even a dress. Nor does 
adopting a man's favorite comfortable pieces into a woman's wardrobe mean she's 
cross-dressing. Susie Tompkins' collection includes menswear-inspired pieces 
that are every bit feminine. Among the strongest-selling items, says 
spokeswoman Cassie Hughes Ederer, are trousers. "Our classic trousers are 
forgiving to the hips but come straight down and cuff. In the past we've seen 
menswear-inspired clothes for women that were really constricting, even tight. 
There's a softening now in texture play, fabrics with sheen and no shoulder 
pads." Even brown has entered the picture as a softer staple color used to 
replace black, she adds. Back in the Saddle 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing silk underwear is not exactly the tough-guy stuff a cowboy will 
typically confess to. But anyone who's spent time atop a horse knows all too 
well about irritating chafing -- and the bizarre remedies that everyone tries 
but no one mentions. Until Saddle Bums -- a chafe-preventing "cowboy underwear" 
-- entered the horse riding scene. "Now everybody's admitting (chafing) and 
talking about it out in the open," Stan Dill, creator of Saddle Bums, says with 
a laugh. Since its introduction in a recent issue of the Western Horseman 
magazine, orders are stampeding into Dill's Millville ranch near Redding. 
Resembling cycling shorts, Dill's briefs are cut of a breathable, stretch 
material and are padded along the crotch area with an antibacterial, synthetic 
chamois seat that wicks away moisture and prevents chafing. It hits above the 
knee to protect a rider from rubbing jean inseams. And everything, insists 
Dill, is made in the U.S. "We thought only part-time cowboys would be 
interested," says Dill, who, when not living on a ranch, is usually in a 
three-piece, running his computer business. "But real ranchers want them." So 
do motorcyclists, who apparently experience the same problem. The underpants, 
available through the ranch, for him or her in Sizes small to XXX-large, are 
$38.50. ROSE APODACA JONES

TIMELESS TREASURES; CLOTHES THAT HAVE REMAINED IN WARDROBES FOR YEARS CAN LOOK 
AS CURRENT AS WHEN THEY CAME OFF THE RACKS. SUCH CLASSICS SHOULD BE THE 
BUILDING BLOCKS OF EVERY WARDROBE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fashion trends come and go, but classics like a boxy Chanel jacket, St. John 
knit or navy Brooks Brothers suit never die. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothes that have remained in wardrobes for years can look as current as when 
they came off the racks. There are people who proudly sport 10-year-old 
jackets, 20-year-old cashmere sweaters and 30-year-old Levi's -- and nobody is 
the wiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion consultants say such classics should be the building blocks of every 
wardrobe. The key is knowing which styles are timeless and which will go the 
way of yesterday's bell-bottoms or today's vinyl miniskirts. 
</P>
<P>
 If a garment has limited use, if it can't be worn to a variety of places and 
doesn't mix well with other pieces in the wardrobe, then it's probably not a 
classic, says Kitty Leslie, a Laguna Niguel fashion consultant. Wearability is 
the key to determining a style's longevity. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's for a rock concert, it's not a classic," Leslie says. "A perfect 
example of a classic garment is a blazer. It's wearable. It can be worn on many 
occasions. It also adapts to many pieces of the wardrobe." 
</P>
<P>
 Styles become classic because they look good on most people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Combat boots don't look good on everybody, whereas a tennis shoe or an 
espadrille does," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue jeans and trench coats are other examples of classics. Stirrup pants 
started out as a trend, but women like the way they look in them so much that 
they're on their way to classic status. 
</P>
<P>
 "A stirrup pant gives a good, flattering line and will take a jacket, blouse 
or a sweater, whereas a wide-legged pant only takes a certain style of jacket," 
Leslie says. 
</P>
<P>
 Knit dresses by St. John have become classics that women wear for years. Marie 
Gray, designer and co-founder of St. John in Irvine, says the garments' 
simplicity makes them timeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many things that are timeless are simple pieces that are easy to wear. 
They're not on the cutting edge of fashion, but they're always elegant," Gray 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John uses a timeless material -- wool knit -- and classic ornamentation 
such as buttons and belt buckles that look like jewelry for long-lasting looks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really tell what season they were created," Gray says. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers have sent St. John pieces that are 10 or 20 years old to the company 
for alterations. One recent arrival, a pale yellow sheath with crocheted 
detailing, was made just a few years after St. John began in 1962 but does not 
look out of date with today's lacy, feminine styles. Women hold onto these 
dresses because they're highly wearable, Gray says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I design with the idea that these have to be worn by real people to real 
places. It's not for flash on the runway. It's for luncheons, the office, a 
great dinner party," she says. "You can dress it up or down and take it from 
day to evening." 
</P>
<P>
 To be truly timeless, a garment has to be versatile, says Sandy Deem, district 
manager of Episode, a women's clothing store in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. 
A one-button, hip-length jacket can be worn years because of its versatility. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might see it with slightly larger or smaller shoulder pads, but it's 
always in style," she says. "Then you can accessorize it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pairing a classic with something trendy like fall's cropped mohair sweaters 
keeps them looking fresh, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Other classics on her list are cashmere turtlenecks and cardigans and trousers 
with pleated fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a cashmere turtleneck for six or seven years. You wouldn't know if I 
bought it yesterday," she says. Ditto for her wool gabardine, double-breasted 
jacket. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For men, styles have changed dramatically in the past five years, yet it's 
still possible to avoid clothes with short life spans, according to Bjorn 
Sedleniek, owner of POSH, a men's clothing store in Fashion Island Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion-forward clothing such as Armani suits have exaggerated features, 
including extra-wide shoulders, drapey silhouettes and lapels with low notches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It breaks away from the conventional look of a tailored coat," Sedleniek 
says. "What keeps a suit classic is the notch of the lapel, the lapel width and 
how it tapers through the waist." 
</P>
<P>
 Suits that fit the body well and have a natural shoulder are more likely to 
last from season to season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Classic suits have a tendency to truly fit, which makes them more comfortable 
to wear throughout the day," Sedleniek says. "Trendy, oversize suits may look 
great, but often they're not as comfortable. . . . If the shoulder doesn't fit, 
by the end of the day it will be dragging you down." 
</P>
<P>
 A solid navy, navy pin-stripe or dark gray suit that fits well will never go 
out of style, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what fashion wants to do, they're not going to do away with good, 
classic clothing," Sedleniek says. "You can still put on the same navy blue 
suit you bought five years ago and not look dated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For clothing to be classic, it must be made of classic material. Linen, wool 
and knits are timeless because they're wearable, Leslie says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What isn't classic are the transparent fabrics," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Crinkled rayon skirts and dresses, while flattering on many figures, appear 
destined for extinction because their wrinkles makes them difficult to mix and 
match with other pieces in the wardrobe, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The material's print and color can also date a garment. Leslie steers away 
from prints because they're harder to match with other pieces than solids. For 
someone who wants to wear prints, she recommends more timeless and versatile 
polka dots and stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 Classic colors such as navy, black, red and white help prevent a garment from 
aging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are forever. It's when you get into hot pinks and other brights that 
you may not be as fond of (a garment) next season," Gray says. 
</P>
<P>
 Trendy earth tones such as olive and brown that have been strong in menswear 
for the past five years are likely to die out, says Orvey Hampton, manager of 
Tom James of Orange County in Irvine, a men's clothier that travels to the 
client's home or office. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come and go because people get tired of them. But navy, charcoal and 
blue-gray are timeless," Hampton says. "Men will wear those long after we're 
gone."

A VICTORIAN PARADE OF FINERY; VINTAGE: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN GET AN EYEFUL OF A 
PRISTINE COLLECTION FROM THE TURN OF THE CENTURY -- PLUS DETAILED NARRATION -- 
AT A FASHION SHOW IN FULLERTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, when men were gentlemen and women ladies, there was time for 
tea and reason for everyone to sport hats and gloves. High temperatures were 
not an excuse to strip into careless disarray. And bearing 30 pounds of 
gorgeous fabrics while strapped and bound tightly in a corset was the height of 
fashion and taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Times might have changed for most, but don't tell that to the ladies and gents 
assembled recently for a Victorian fashion show at the Fullerton Arboretum's 
Heritage House on the Cal State Fullerton campus. The afternoon sun demanded 
the most minimal of clothes, but many of the guests preferred to attend the 
event in Victorian-inspired finery. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least they got to sit under an awning in the garden, unlike the three 
models who braved the heat to bring to life impeccably preserved originals from 
the turn of the century. The collection included fashions by Worth, a famous 
name among the well-to-do of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Each dress represented the utmost of elegance and quality of the era: flowing 
velvet skirts, China silk sheaths, Battenburg lace and iridescent taffetas. And 
every tedious detail seemed to be considered in their making. There were mini 
knife-pleat ruffles, jet beading on netting, intricately ornate embroidery and 
endless lines of tiny buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 The dozen museum pieces came with a live narration from their current owner, 
Carnell Kirkeeng. The Fallbrook actor and antique dealer has amassed a 
collection of pristine clothes from 1810 through the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the construction information about each vintage dress, Kirkeeng 
had a story about how he came to own it. Many were donations from strangers who 
had heard of his growing collection. Others were saved from indignity, such as 
a textured silk dress with ribbon woven into the fabric that was taken to a 
seamstress to make into pillows. Fortunately, she knew Kirkeeng and persuaded 
the client to send it on to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkeeng first discovered fashion studying costuming at the Art Center in 
1937. The Depression forced him to leave the indulgence of costumes for 
practical fashion, but he stayed close to his first love through years spent 
acting at the Old Globe Theater and Starlight Opera in San Diego, among other 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, he went to a yard sale given by a grandchild of Dolores 
Costello Barrymore, the actress and wife of John Barrymore. "I've never been so 
rude in my life. I went and grabbed everything I could," recalls Kirkeeng. "I 
just kept thinking the other customers there were just going to make doll 
clothes from these beautiful things." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then his collection has become a traveling exhibit, making appearances 
at least six times a year to places such as the Heritage House. The 75-year-old 
Kirkeeng has made the past his hobby; he lives in the third-oldest house in 
Fallbrook, which doubles as an antique shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a disease once you get into it. I'm sure I should have been born 100 
years ago," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The vintage fashion show was one in a series of events at Heritage House, 
which is celebrating its centennial. The series follows the engagement and 
wedding of Dr. George Clark and Miss Edith Johnston, who married in December, 
1894, and settled in what is now Fullerton. Their home is now Heritage House. 
The fashion show pretended to spotlight the selections Miss Johnston had 
available for her bridal trousseau. In December, a Victorian wedding tea will 
be re-enacted, followed by a masked ball "reception" in February at the Queen 
Mary in Long Beach.

UNTIMELY NICK DELAYS BRIDE'S GIFT OF KIDNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nationally publicized kidney transplant operation involving two newlyweds 
was postponed Wednesday when a radiologist performing a routine test on the 
Mission Viejo donor nicked an artery in her left kidney, imperiling her ability 
to donate her other kidney to the man who needs it to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some chance the organ transplant may be canceled altogether as a 
result of the injury to 45-year-old Victoria Ingram-Curlee, who had been 
scheduled to donate her right kidney Wednesday to Randall Curlee, 46, a gravely 
ill diabetic whom she had married in the hospital chapel 24 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at Sharp Memorial Hospital, where the operation was scheduled to be 
performed, said Ingram-Curlee will need three to four weeks to heal before 
surgeons can determine whether she remains the almost-perfect donor they 
believed her to be Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Mendez, director of renal transplantation at Sharp Memorial and a 
veteran of 3,000 kidney operations, said Wednesday's mishap produced a "25% to 
35%" chance that Ingram-Curlee will be unable to donate either kidney to 
Curlee, who needs the new organ because of his advanced diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very disappointed, but the way I'm looking at this, it's just a minor 
setback," Ingram-Curlee said in a statement released by the hospital. "I'll 
heal quickly and we'll proceed as planned. We don't want this to impact other 
donors. What happened today is very rare, and we don't intend to let it get in 
the way." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am concerned about Victoria," Curlee said in his statement. "She's an 
amazing person, and, of course, wants to go ahead immediately. It's an 
unfortunate complication, but I want Victoria to be completely well. We'll go 
ahead when she is better." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's unusual romance had captured national attention, leading to 
interviews on "Good Morning, America" and the "Today" show before they 
exchanged vows in the hospital's chapel Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez said the incident occurred during an "X-ray assessment" of 
Ingram-Curlee's left kidney, which doctors needed to evaluate before they could 
remove and transplant her right one. He said doctors prefer using the left 
kidney in transplants, because "the renal vein is longer," making the operation 
easier and safer from a technical standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred during an arteriogram, a procedure designed to "assess 
the normalcy of the kidneys, the anatomy of the kidneys," Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the radiologist -- whom Mendez identified as Dr. Harold Coons -- 
began his "routine preoperative procedure" at 8 a.m. Wednesday, 6 1/2 hours 
before surgery, he discovered that blood flowed through three arteries in 
Ingram-Curlee's left kidney, rather than the usual one, Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coons inserted a narrow catheter tube into the arteries in order to inject a 
dye that would help him evaluate how well blood flowed through those vessels, 
Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the assessment of these arteries, a small accessory artery . . . was 
nicked, partially compromising the blood supply to a lower area of the kidney," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez called the incident "very unfortunate," saying it occurs "very rarely." 
He said Coons -- who could not be reached for comment -- "doesn't feel very 
good about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Medical experts said such injuries are rare but well-known risks when 
undertaking such procedures. Dr. Ervin Ruzics , director of kidney 
transplantation at UC Irvine Medical Center in Irvine, said it would be 
"incorrect" to call Wednesday's incident "a slip-up." 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you invade the human body, anytime you put an instrument or a 
catheter in the human body, these are the things that can occur," Ruzics said. 
"It's just the nature of the beast. It sounds self-serving for a physician to 
say, but sometimes no amount of caution can prevent such occurrences." 
</P>
<P>
 A San Diego radiologist who is not associated with Coons' practice said 
Wednesday that "if I was going to have an arteriogram by somebody, I would want 
it performed by (Coons). He's one of the top 20 in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Curlee nor his wife wanted to face the media on Wednesday, according 
to hospital spokeswoman Cathy Spearnak. Curlee will be released from the 
hospital today, Mendez said, and his bride will be released Friday or Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The newlyweds met two years ago at an open house that Ingram-Curlee, an Orange 
County real estate agent, was holding in Curlee's neighborhood. "I was planning 
on selling my house," he later told reporters, and walked in, only to meet the 
woman of his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Curlee's diabetes was diagnosed in his teens and has suffered many of the 
complications associated with the disease, including kidney failure, a heart 
attack and vision problems. He takes insulin injections twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Curlee learned he would need a kidney transplant, he brought his 
fiancee to the doctor to show her what she would face when she married him. She 
offered to be tested as a donor, and despite the low expectations of Curlee's 
medical advisers, Ingram-Curlee proved to be what Mendez called an astonishing, 
almost-perfect match. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram-Curlee's kidney matched Curlee's on two out of six vitally important 
criteria, "but they were the most important," Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curlee probably will not need dialysis treatments while he awaits the 
transplant but will be evaluated daily for the next two to four weeks, Mendez 
said. At the end of that time, he will either receive one of his wife's kidneys 
or one from another donor. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of what he called "an incredible barrage" of national publicity, 
Mendez said the chances of finding a suitable donor -- other than Ingram-Curlee 
-- had been "greatly increased." 
</P>
<P>
 But approximately 36,000 people are on the waiting list for kidneys, and only 
about 4,000 kidneys become available each year. Most come from patients who die 
in hospitals. Live transplants usually come from blood relatives, but Curlee's 
relatives were not compatible.

GOLDEN YEARS TARNISHED BY FEAR IN VALLEY; VIOLENCE: THE SLAYINGS OF TWO ELDERLY 
WOMEN IN VAN NUYS PUT SENIORS ON EDGE. SOME FEEL LIKE PRISONERS IN THEIR HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's strange, Grace Salerno says now, how the cozy old house where she has 
lived for 42 years could turn into such an ominous place -- just another modest 
urban dwelling where danger inhabits the dark corners and empty rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this was home , the place where she and her late husband, Joseph, 
raised their two daughters, God-fearing parents who watched black-and-white 
television on summer evenings, lying in bed, talking about the day's events and 
how much they loved one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Joseph is gone, the girls have moved away and the nights are different: 
The 75-year-old woman lies awake at night with a .22-caliber pistol under her 
pillow, in terror of having to fight off an intruder. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, as she ate lunch with scores of other elderly diners at the 
Bernardi multipurpose senior center, she said her fears grew after two elderly 
Van Nuys women were killed in the past four days, apparently by burglars. 
</P>
<P>
 Berneda McMackin, 77, was found beaten to death Sunday in her home. Two days 
later, 72-year-old Aliza Levi was slain when she apparently startled a burglar 
shortly after her husband left their Norwich Avenue home to run errands. 
</P>
<P>
 While police say the killings are unrelated, aging widows like Salerno say the 
crimes are a cruel and sobering reminder of the dangers of being old and alone 
in a big city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It scares me to death to go to bed now," the retired nurse said over a 
roast-beef-and-cabbage lunch. "I lay there with my knees knocking, wondering if 
I'll ever have the courage to use that gun if someone comes for me in the 
darkness. I pray to God that I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, scores of elderly Van Nuys residents gather at the senior center for 
lunch and social affairs. But at 4 p.m., when the center closes its doors, many 
return to all-too-quiet homes devoid of spouses, children -- and a sense of 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the senior citizen version of "Home Alone." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know which door to go in," said 74-year-old widow Margaret 
Vreeland, who has been mugged on the street twice since her husband died in 
1971. She still has the scar where two thieves cut her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live alone. It's just me and my little doggie, Little Bit. She barks like 
the dickens whenever anyone comes near the house. But she's old, 15 years old 
now. I know I'm going to lose her someday soon. And I don't know what I'll do 
then." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi center Director Sabella Richardson says the killings haven't come up 
much in conversations at the gathering place. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come to forget their troubles," she said. "But we have a lot of 
elderly women here, a lot of them. And they live alone. I can't see why the Van 
Nuys police aren't here telling these people how to better protect themselves 
at home. I mean, how can they do that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Habif had the answer: The 76-year-old volunteer delivery man for Meals on 
Wheels says he has seen too many trusting men and women open locked doors for 
the flimsiest of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I gotta say is, 'Meals on Wheels' and the door opens," said the 
white-bearded man in a sea captain's hat. "I've delivered flowers too. When I 
yell, 'Flowers!' the door opens. As long as the voice is friendly, they throw 
down their defenses. They should be cautious." 
</P>
<P>
 At one of the center's cafeteria tables, 70-year-old Marion Whitley said she 
fled the big-city dangers of Queens, N.Y., three months ago. Now, two of her 
neighbors have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me too," said lunch mate Lucien Farland, 67, a former postal worker and 
sheriff's deputy from nearby Panorama City. "It makes me glad I've got 11 
reasons to keep strangers away. Five go in one gun and six in another. They're 
bullets! And if I hear just one strange noise, I'm up. And, let me tell you, 
I'm a light sleeper." 
</P>
<P>
 In a game of seeming one-upmanship, the two traded urban fright. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many old ladies open their doors without looking through their peepholes 
first," Whitley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not me," Farland responded. "I don't open my door for anyone who doesn't know 
me. And if they can't say my name first, then they don't know me." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitley frowned. "I just don't know, sometimes you can't even go to the store 
or to church anymore; you're too afraid, even in broad daylight! I used to go 
dancing. Now I have an exercise bike right in my room." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Farland: "Sometimes, I just say, 'The heck with it!' I don't even go out 
anymore. It's a hell of a way to live your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Salerno's daughters -- one lives in Alaska, the other in Ventura County 
-- have long encouraged her to move away from the house she shares with her 
88-year-old aunt, Frances, whom he describes as "sharper than any tack." 
</P>
<P>
 But she just can't seem to leave the old house. There are too many memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for a woman my age to root herself up and just move away," she 
said. "I've got friends, church and community here. How could I start anyplace 
else?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, though, since Joseph, a plumbing contractor, died, Salerno feels 
like a prisoner in the home she once considered the safest place on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every window has a stick in it" to hold it closed, she sighs. "Every door has 
a deadbolt. There isn't a cross breeze anymore, no fresh air. Frances and I, 
we're a couple of old-lady prisoners is what we are. But as long as we can feel 
a little bit safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, Salerno went to a discount store and asked the salesman for a 
gun "a little old lady could handle." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the weapon hasn't been fired. 
</P>
<P>
 'It's sad," Salerno said. "These are supposed to be our golden years. What 
they are is more like rusty tin." 
</P>
<P>
 An elderly man from across the table spoke up: "Well, if Joseph were still 
around, he'd protect you. He'd hit them with a lead pipe." 
</P>
<P>
 Salerno's face suddenly flushed with memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said. "My Joseph was a pacifist. He'd never approve of me owning a 
gun. But what can I do? Frances and I are all alone now, all alone."

NOBEL PRIZE AWARDED TO USC CHEMIST; SCIENCE: GEORGE OLAH IS RECOGNIZED FOR WORK 
WITH HYDROCARBONS. AN AMERICAN AND A CANADIAN SHARE PHYSICS AWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ and CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A University of Southern California chemist whose mastery of the most powerful 
acids known helped pave the way for less polluting gasoline, more effective oil 
refining and many modern drugs won the Nobel Prize for chemistry, the Royal 
Swedish Academy of Sciences announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 George A. Olah, who fled first to Canada, then to the United States after a 
1956 Soviet military crackdown in his homeland of Hungary, has almost 
single-handedly established USC as a notable center of advanced industrial 
chemistry, scientists and university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedish Academy on Wednesday also awarded the Nobel Prize in physics to 
Clifford Shull, 79, a physicist who has retired from the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, and Canadian Bertram Brockhouse, 76, of McMaster 
University in Ontario. Working independently, they made pioneering 
contributions to the studies of condensed matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Olah, 67, a genial grandfather whose receding crown of steel gray hair frames 
a craggy profile and an avuncular smile, said Wednesday that he is giving the 
$945,000 prize money to his wife, Judith Olah, a chemist who worked with him in 
the laboratory until her retirement four years ago. She handles the family 
finances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about their professional collaboration, she said, "He was a marvelous 
boss. I mean we are still married after working (together) since 1955. That 
should tell you everything." 
</P>
<P>
 As he raised a crystal flute of champagne to toast the award, Olah clearly was 
savoring more than the heady bubbles of the wine. He grinned at USC President 
Stephen Sample and said, "We will put USC on the map for something different 
than football." 
</P>
<P>
 The award cited his discovery of how to make concentrated solutions of unusual 
hydrocarbons in what he calls magic acids, creating an entire new field of 
chemistry of considerable theoretical, and practical, importance. 
</P>
<P>
 The potent acids -- billions of times stronger than conventional acids -- are 
able to activate organic chemical compounds, called carbocations, in reactions 
that were previously thought to be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hydrocarbons are the raw materials of many things we use in daily life, of 
oil and natural gas, and we take them for granted," Olah said. "Look around, 
practically everything is touched by hydrocarbons. They are used for making 
gasoline, pharmaceuticals and plastic, so it is very important to understand 
the process by which hydrocarbons are transformed." 
</P>
<P>
 Olah holds more than 100 patents, including some for work that led to 
lead-free gasoline and several drugs. He has authored more than 900 research 
papers and has helped shape the development of organic chemistry in the second 
half of the 20th Century, colleagues said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The direction of this field did change completely through the original and 
imaginative work by this year's Nobel Prize laureate," the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his office Wednesday, Olah sat surrounded by chemical texts stacked 12 deep 
and basked in congratulatory telephone calls from around the world, including 
Hungary, while his colleagues beamed and tossed confetti. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just wonderful," Olah said. He singled out for praise his longtime 
collaborator, Surya Prakash, at USC's Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute, 
which Olah directs. 
</P>
<P>
 Olah grew up in Budapest between World Wars I and II. He never gave a thought 
to becoming a scientist, he said, until after graduating from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was interested in history and many other things. Thank God I never pursued 
them. Who is interested in medieval Hungarian history?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the USC faculty in 1977 after a decade at Case Western Reserve 
University in Cleveland, where his work earned him membership in the National 
Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the research that led to his Nobel Prize, he said there was never a flash 
of dazzling insight, no eureka moment. Instead, his discoveries were the result 
of unusually long hours of laboratory routine that typically began just after 
dawn and continued until 10 at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scientist are like kids who try to search for the new and unexpected. But you 
don't come into your lab at 9 in the morning and say today I am going to make a 
great fundamental discovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Olah's work is distinguished by its immense practical applications. He spoke 
forcefully in support of the kind of goal-oriented research that, among many 
funding agencies, is rapidly overtaking the more traditional pursuit of basic 
knowledge for its own sake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing wrong, all things being equal, in doing something that may 
be of some use. Some people think you are tainted if you do something that is 
even remotely practical. I think it is a challenge to do something that also 
has some practical use," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Olah is still actively pursuing his research, the two men who share the 
physics prize retired years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Brockhouse and Shull made their discoveries at the dawn of the nuclear age 
almost 40 years ago. Working with relatively primitive nuclear reactors, they 
helped develop powerful methods of analyzing matter when X-rays and microscopes 
cannot see enough detail, called neutron scattering techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "In simple terms, Clifford G. Shull has helped answer the question of where 
atoms 'are' and Bertram N. Brockhouse the question of what atoms 'do,' " 
academy officials said in announcing the award. 
</P>
<P>
 Brockhouse, 76, now lives in Hamilton, Ontario, an industrial center and 
university town of 315,000 people about 45 miles west of Toronto. At a news 
conference at McMaster University in Hamilton, where he taught from 1962 until 
his retirement in 1984, he appeared less excited than his former colleagues in 
the physics department, who beamed and applauded their mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a tweedy gray jacket over a taupe pullover, Brockhouse described 
himself as "an intellectual explorer" and likened his pioneering work with the 
atom to that of a geological map maker who lays down the basic chart that other 
scientists use to mine practical, everyday applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we work on with basic science is just a bigger atlas with places and 
objects and so on that are not as familiar in ordinary life as is the earth and 
the air and sea and the rocks," he said. " . . . What my work did . . . is just 
add some more information, some more insight into what this world, this 
physical world, is." 
</P>
<P>
 Brockhouse, a native of Lethbridge, Alberta, began dissecting the inner 
workings of the atom at Canada's Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories near Ottawa. 
The work cited for the Nobel continued through the 1950s and into the early 
1960s after he joined the McMaster faculty, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brockhouse explored the movement or dynamics of atoms in solid and electric 
matter through a process called thermal neutron scattering. He developed the 
triple axis crystal spectrometer and other neutron scattering instruments and 
techniques that are the basis for methods still used today. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was driven by the challenge of the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a very long time before I actually became a scientist, it was science 
that I wanted to do," he said. "Of course, it's characteristic of research, 
real research, that you don't know what you're going to do. All you know is 
where you stand at the moment and some vague intuitions of where you might go 
from there." 
</P>
<P>
 His reaction to the prize, he said, was "enormous astonishment, of course." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has "no idea" what he will do with the money that accompanies the 
prize, but suggested that he might use the stature that adheres to a Nobelist 
to promote the cause of energy conservation and other environmental issues 
about which he feels strongly. 
</P>
<P>
 By studying simple compounds such as table salt, Shull and his colleagues 
discovered that neutrons are deflected in a distinctive pattern when they 
strike a sample of material. That allows researchers to determine the sample's 
atomic structure. Shull performed his original experiments almost 50 years ago 
at the federal laboratory at Oak Ridge, Tenn., then continued his work at MIT.

U.S. ALLIES BLOCK IRAQ BUFFER PLAN; MIDEAST: FRANCE REJECTS IDEA OF A MILITARY 
EXCLUSION ZONE NORTH OF KUWAIT, WHILE BRITAIN IS LUKEWARM TO IT. OFFICIALS SAY 
CLINTON HAS NOT DECIDED ON FURTHER MEASURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 American allies Wednesday thwarted a Clinton Administration plan to create a 
military exclusion zone on the Iraqi side of the Kuwait border, forcing U.S. 
officials to scramble for a new formula to prevent a recurrence of the current 
dispute with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 The French firmly rejected the plan, saying that Iraqi troop movements within 
the country's borders do not violate United Nations resolutions or 
international law. British officials gave the American idea a lukewarm 
reception and said they were looking for other ways to limit Hussein's 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides said that while President Clinton continues to believe that 
an internationally enforced exclusion zone may be the best way to ensure that 
Hussein does not threaten Kuwait, Clinton is not trying "at this point" to sell 
the idea to reluctant allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that Clinton has not yet decided what further measures to take 
if Hussein leaves his troops in a threatening position or does not pull them 
back to the positions they held before the buildup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President has made no decision on what he's going to do in the final 
event to make sure that Saddam Hussein cannot again threaten the security of 
the region," a senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials insisted that the United States and its allies have the 
authority to launch military attacks on Iraqi troops if Hussein does not 
fulfill pledges to withdraw them from the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said intelligence reports showed Iraq continuing to 
withdraw its forces from the Kuwaiti border region in response to U.S. demands, 
but they added that it was still too early to tell where the troops were being 
sent. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior defense official said that parts of two of the three divisions that 
the Iraqis moved into the area during their recent troop buildup -- amounting 
to half the number they deployed recently -- had been loading their equipment 
onto railroad cars and moving it north. 
</P>
<P>
 But he cautioned: "It's going to take a number of days before we can really 
feel confident to say (that) we know the force is pulling out. We don't see any 
evidence that (the Iraqis) might be playing a game out there. But again, only 
time will tell." 
</P>
<P>
 In a proposal circulating at the United Nations, the Administration is asking 
international support for a resolution demanding that Iraq return its offensive 
forces to the "status quo ante," referring to their positions before the rapid 
buildup in southern Iraq detected last week. 
</P>
<P>
 American U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright met with the four other 
ambassadors who have the power of veto and proposed that the Security Council 
pass a resolution demanding that the Iraqi troops go back to their earlier 
positions and never threaten the Kuwaiti border again. 
</P>
<P>
 An American official at the United Nations said the other four diplomats -- 
representing Russia, Britain, China and France -- did not object to the 
substance of the resolution. But the Russians asked that a vote be put off 
until Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev completes a trip to Baghdad. 
Kozyrev is scheduled to arrive in the Iraqi capital today to join a team of 
Russian diplomats who are trying to defuse the tension between Hussein and the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the same goals as Kozyrev," the U.S. official said. "Whether we pass 
the resolution before or after he goes to Baghdad is still an open question." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the official, the American resolution would require that elite 
Republican Guard units leave the south and not return and that the army 
divisions that were in the south before the current buildup are never again 
deployed in a way that threatens Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution does not contain any provision for enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not seeking an authorization for the use of force," the American 
official said. "We believe we already have that in existing Security Council 
resolutions and in Article 51 of the U.N. Charter," which guarantees the right 
of self-defense against aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 The American official even denied that the United States had ever proposed an 
exclusion zone that would prohibit the deployment of any heavy weapons in 
southern Iraq. "An exclusion zone was never something we proposed," he said. 
"That was greatly exaggerated. It was never a decision by the Administration. 
We never proposed it to anyone at the U.N." 
</P>
<P>
 However, numerous senior U.S. officials -- including the deputy defense 
secretary and Albright herself -- had floated the exclusion zone idea in the 
previous two days. Secretary of State Warren Christopher also discussed it with 
officials of the Gulf Cooperation Council in Kuwait City on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would have created a military exclusion zone on the Iraqi side of 
the Kuwait border and prohibited Iraq from sending certain kinds of troops and 
equipment into the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that one option considered was to use the same boundaries as 
the "no-fly" zone that the allies established over southern Iraq in 1992, which 
bars all flights by Iraqi aircraft below the 32nd Parallel, 150 miles from the 
Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the earlier plan, Iraq would have been able to keep some troops within 
the zone, equal in size and composition to those that it has maintained there 
traditionally. But it would not have been permitted to assemble offensive 
forces and armored equipment in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had said that one benefit of establishing such an exclusion zone 
would be that allied warplanes, which have been flying sorties over the area 
for months, could enforce it easily. 
</P>
<P>
 A British official said that the "permanent five," as the five governments 
with the U.N. veto are known, will meet again today to discuss the Albright 
"status quo" proposal. According to another Security Council ambassador, the 
resolution had not yet been shown to the other 10 members of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The British official also said it is possible that the five ambassadors might 
prefer a Security Council statement rather than a resolution. A statement has 
less legal force than a resolution but requires unanimous consent of the 
council. A resolution can be passed with only nine votes as long as none of the 
nay votes comes from one of the permanent five. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department officials said that the United States will continue troop 
deployments to Kuwait, with 35,883 U.S. ground troops expected to be there by 
the end of the week.

JUROR QUESTIONING BEGINS SLOWLY IN SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The judge and lawyers in the O.J. Simpson murder trial began the painstaking 
process of questioning prospective jurors Wednesday, using the opening session 
to score subtle propaganda points while searching for evidence of bias among 
the panelists. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito initiated the hearing by welcoming 84 
prospective jurors into his courtroom and briefing them on the law and 
procedures that will govern the coming trial. With Simpson in the courtroom, 
Ito read the charges against the football great, stressing for the prospective 
jurors that it is the prosecution's burden to prove the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not evidence and should not be considered as such," Ito said after 
reading the document charging that Simpson used a knife to murder Ronald Lyle 
Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson on June 12. Simpson has pleaded not guilty to 
those charges; if convicted, he could spend the rest of his life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial questioning of the panel suggested that it was diverse in many 
ways: The group was drawn from across Los Angeles County and includes 
prospective jurors of various ethnicities. Among the first panelists questioned 
were a 77-year-old World War II veteran, a 52-year-old employee of the county 
tax collector and a 35-year-old hardware salesman who listed Ronald Reagan, 
Debbie Reynolds and Jim Morrison as celebrities he admires. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial screening of jurors ended last month when Ito and the lawyers took 
time out to examine the 79-page questionnaires filled out by each of the more 
than 300 prospective panelists. The oral questioning that began Wednesday moved 
slowly: By day's end, just four of the jurors had been questioned, far fewer 
than the 20 that Ito had hoped to interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Three prospective jurors were dismissed, one after being briefly questioned, 
the other two by agreement of the two sides based on their answers to the 
questionnaires. A fourth juror failed to return from a break and was dismissed. 
The slow pace made some prospective jurors restless. Ito met with attorneys at 
the end of the day to discuss ways to speed up the process. 
</P>
<P>
 He deferred making a decision on whether to revise the process today, but said 
he would reconsider alternatives at the lunch break if things drag again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the questioning Wednesday yielded little direct evidence of progress, 
a number of themes emerged that are likely to dominate the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides delicately probed issues of race, for instance, and each touched on 
the question of how jurors should evaluate the significance of investigative 
mistakes -- Simpson's lawyers have made clear for months that they intend to 
hammer on alleged bungles by the Los Angeles Police Department and the 
coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the lawyers made the most of their first opportunity to talk to 
jurors to raise the topic of a hung jury. Simpson's camp emphasized to 
prospective jurors that they should vote their conscience even if it means 
failing to reach a verdict. Prosecutors retorted by reminding the panelists 
that they should listen to one another and be willing to reconsider their 
opinions if their fellow jurors make compelling arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the enormous publicity that has accompanied the Simpson case, neither 
side expects to find jurors who are totally ignorant of the murders. Indeed, 
Ito told prospective jurors in Wednesday's panel that he would have doubts 
about anyone who professed ignorance of the case altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not looking for hermits," Ito said. "We would be very suspicious of a Rip 
Van Winkle who just awoke yesterday and had not heard about this case. . . . 
The issue is: Can you set aside what you have heard?" 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset of Wednesday's hearing, attorneys for both sides were cordial 
with the panelists, and Simpson stood every time they entered or left the room. 
As Robert L. Shapiro, one of Simpson's lead attorneys, introduced himself and 
the defense team, Simpson stood and said: "Good morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the presence of the panel, however, tempers flared: At one point, 
Shapiro accused prosecutors of defying Ito, and Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark 
retorted that it was Shapiro who was violating the court's direction. Each side 
asked Ito to punish the other; Ito declined. 
</P>
<P>
 That fight, the latest in a series of debates, erupted over the mundane 
question of whether jury consultants hired by the prosecutors should be 
required to sit near the prosecution team and be identified to the jury. The 
consultants sat among jurors in the morning, but after Shapiro complained, 
their seating was changed and they were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the four prospective jurors who was questioned Wednesday was 
dismissed. That man works for the Sheriff's Department and among his duties is 
keeping track of how much money the department has spent on the Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 He was allowed to leave after consulting privately with Ito and the attorneys, 
but three others were carefully questioned in front of the rest of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 First up was the county employee, a 52-year-old Monterey Park woman. During an 
hourlong interview by the judge and lawyers for each side, that woman 
repeatedly promised that she could serve fairly and said she had resisted 
forming impressions about the case despite the deluge of publicity that it has 
attracted. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who works in the tax collector's office, came under especially 
close questioning by Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of Simpson's lead attorneys 
and one of Los Angeles' most experienced trial lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran gently reviewed the woman's answers to the juror questionnaire and 
used his queries to remind her and the other panelists of their obligations: 
"You won't, then, subscribe to the old adage that 'Where there's smoke, there's 
fire,' will you?" Cochran asked at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, sir," the woman responded. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the woman said she thought she recognized Cochran from the Rodney G. 
King case, Cochran laughed and told her she had the wrong lawyer: "That's the 
first case of mistaken identity in this case," he said, drawing laughter from 
the panelists. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark also treated the panelist delicately, beginning her questioning by 
reassuring the woman about her nervousness. "It's very difficult to talk in 
front of people," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through their questioning, Clark and Cochran each subtly attempted to make 
points on the delicate issue of a hung jury -- a possibility that legal experts 
have publicly speculated about for months. 
</P>
<P>
 In his questioning of the first panelist, Cochran asked whether she would be 
willing to hold out if 11 of her colleagues favored a verdict that she could 
not honestly support. She said she could hold out under such circumstances. 
Then, when Clark questioned her, the same woman pledged that she would be 
willing to listen to her fellow jurors and would not be unwilling to change her 
mind if they persuaded her that she was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. William W. Hodgman, Clark's partner in the case, echoed 
that theme during later questioning of another panelist, suggesting that 
Cochran had planted the "subliminal message" that a hung jury was desirable and 
stressing that jurors should try to reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon session was highlighted by the questioning of a gregarious, 
balding, 77-year-old retiree who fought hard to win a place on the jury, 
repeatedly stating he would make an ideal juror. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make up my own mind, and I stick to it," said the man, who repeatedly cited 
his World War II experience as evidence of his courage and willingness to fight 
for his beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to one question from Cochran, the man reiterated his independence 
by asserting: "I'm not one to join a lynch mob at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly hope not," Cochran responded, again prompting laughter from other 
panelists. "And as I look over at you, I want you to know that you don't look 
like a mob guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cochran's questions were gentle, Hodgman attempted to press the man 
harder. He raised, for instance, the question of whether the man might be too 
inflexible to discuss verdicts with other jurors and change his mind if they 
made important points. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the man flatly refused to answer Hodgman's question, saying it would 
be inappropriate to discuss how he might handle deliberations. Then Hodgman 
posed the question differently and asked how he would handle a situation in his 
work if he was faced with disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just eliminate anyone who gave me dissension or who gave me flak," 
the man responded. "I want what I want when I want it . . . That's my way. Take 
it or leave it." 
</P>
<P>
 "All right, sir," Hodgman responded. "I think I understand." 
</P>
<P>
 As the day concluded, the two sides were completing their questioning of a 
35-year-old ponytailed hardware salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 On his questionnaire, that man had expressed considerable reservations about 
serving on the panel, but Wednesday he said he was ready. Despite skeptical 
questioning by Clark, he said that although he had not sought the chance to be 
a juror in the sensational murder case, he was prepared to do his duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't come looking for this," he said. "It came looking for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran led that man through a series of questions intended to demonstrate his 
impartiality and ability to serve well. When the man said he had previously had 
trouble with law enforcement, for instance, Cochran drew him out, eliciting 
from him a statement that his troubles were not with the LAPD and that he could 
therefore be fair in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors asked that that man be removed based on his answers, but Ito 
denied that request. They still could use one of their 20 peremptory challenges 
to take the man off the jury panel without stating a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 As the questioning proceeded, Ito allowed reporters to examine some of the 
questionnaires that potential jurors still on the panel have filled out. On 
one, a 68-year-old black man who was not questioned Wednesday wrote an obscure 
racial slur to refer to Simpson's acting performances in "Roots" and "Naked Gun 
2 1/2." The same juror wrote "hell yes" when asked if domestic violence was 
ever justified. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection resumes at 9 a.m. today, when the court is to take up other 
matters, including a defense motion seeking information about the source and 
purpose of news leaks. Simpson's lawyers have accused the LAPD of leaking at 
least some of that information, and they have served Cmdr. David J. Gascon, the 
department's chief spokesman, with a subpoena ordering him to appear Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A defense source said Tuesday that Simpson's lawyers also intend to subpoena 
KNBC reporter Tracie Savage, Police Chief Willie L. Williams and two 
high-ranking officials of the district attorney's office.

DEPLOYMENT HAS BACKFIRED, IRAQ ENVOY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON and DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Iraq's decision to deploy thousands of troops near its border with Kuwait 
backfired and has dealt "a big -- but not insurmountable -- setback" to 
Baghdad's effort to get out from under the United Nations' crushing economic 
embargo, Nizar Hamdoun, Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamdoun said that President Saddam Hussein acted without informing his top 
foreign policy adviser, Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz, who was in New York 
at the time trying to negotiate an end to the sanctions that have all but 
devastated Iraq's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamdoun's remarks represented an extraordinarily candid assessment for a 
senior Iraqi official, as Hussein is a ruthless dictator who has repeatedly 
stamped out all dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. experts said that the U.N. ambassador's statements, made in an 
interview Wednesday, reflect increasingly visible tension between hard-liners 
in Baghdad, who apparently urged Hussein to move the troops south, and the 
Foreign Ministry, which has been trying to end the embargo through 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Aziz and Hamdoun were at the U.N. ambassador's Manhattan apartment last Friday 
when they were shocked to see a report of the deployment on Cable News Network, 
Hamdoun said. The two had been working with Russian and French diplomats to try 
to shape an embargo proposal that would win U.N. support, and neither of them 
had any idea that the troops were on the move, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aziz was "livid" that the deployment had undermined their efforts at the 
United Nations, according to an American source who is in frequent contact with 
Iraqi officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day Aziz left for Baghdad, stopping briefly in Amman, Jordan, to 
confer with King Hussein. During the Persian Gulf War, the king sided with 
Baghdad, but in the current confrontation he has vowed to join in defending 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 In Baghdad, Aziz told Hussein that the United States was mounting a massive 
military buildup and was serious about confronting any Iraqi threat. The Iraqi 
leader, apparently persuaded, ordered the troops withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials refused to comment on Hamdoun's account. 
</P>
<P>
 But a leading U.S. expert on Iraq, Phebe Marr of the National Defense 
University, said that increasingly visible disagreements have emerged between 
hard-liners in Baghdad and Foreign Ministry officials such as Hamdoun and Aziz. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is clearly a split between doves and hawks," she said. "The divide has 
been in the press in Baghdad for weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hussein apparently remains in firm control, she said, "there is more 
debate going on, and more cracks in the regime than there used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamdoun and Aziz have been the most visible "doves," working for the last year 
to get the U.N. sanctions lifted and, now that "it has blown up in their faces, 
it's understandable that they might be upset," Marr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most prominent among the "hawks," she said, is Hussein's son Uday, who 
publishes Babel, a daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Babel has attacked Tarik Aziz directly," she said. "Uday is saying that the 
Foreign Ministry is wrong, that the negotiations can't work because the United 
States is not going to lift the sanctions and that the only correct strategy 
for Iraq is to raise the costs to the West of maintaining the sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 Aziz, a veteran foreign policy adviser, and Hamdoun, former Iraqi ambassador 
to the United States, both had extensive dealings with U.S. officials before 
Washington broke off relations with Baghdad in 1990 as a result of Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait and the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamdoun, in an interview over lunch at a New York restaurant near his office, 
said Hussein's deployment of the troops was designed to get the attention of 
the U.N. Security Council, which has been monitoring Iraq's progress in meeting 
U.N. disarmament demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq, he insisted, is in full compliance with U.N. disarmament demands dealing 
with nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. And until the deployment of the 
troops, he said, Russian and French diplomats had reacted positively to Iraq's 
efforts. But he pointed out that U.S. and British officials had adamantly 
opposed lifting the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and Britain maintain that Iraq has not fulfilled several of 
the conditions for lifting the embargo, including recognition of Kuwait's 
sovereignty and resolution of a dispute over the border. France and Russia 
acknowledge that, but argue that some relaxation of the embargo would encourage 
Hussein to meet the rest of the U.N. terms. They also argue that the suffering 
of Iraqi citizens, unable to affect their regime, is too great. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamdoun indicated that Iraq was also prepared to deal with the issues of 
Kuwait's border and its sovereignty rights and that he had received information 
that the Kuwaitis were interested in negotiating but that Washington had 
rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point as Hamdoun spoke, his cellular telephone rang. The Iraqi foreign 
minister, Mohammed Said Sahaf, was calling. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief conversation, Hamdoun put down the phone. He looked relieved. 
"He said all the Iraqi troops have been withdrawn from the area near Kuwait," 
Hamdoun said. "The Russian and Chinese military attaches are in the area seeing 
the troops removed and will report back to their governments." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamdoun indicated that, with the massive U.S. military buildup, Baghdad is 
bracing for a punitive strike even though the Iraqi troops have withdrawn. He 
said his course will be to "just continue working with the French and Russians 
to try to get the sanctions lifted." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamdoun served as Iraq's ambassador to Washington from 1983 to 1987, which he 
called the heyday of the two countries' relations. At that time, Washington was 
backing Iraq in its war with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to Iraq, he served as deputy foreign minister until 1992 when he was 
named Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations. He now lives in New York with 
his wife and two daughters, 11 and 10 years old, both born in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamdoun expressed frustration over the fact that American officials refuse to 
deal with Iraqi officials even at the United Nations. He said that Aziz had 
called on U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, but she had refused to see him. 
</P>

COLUMN ONE; SECTS FIND HAVEN WITH QUIET SWISS; THE TRADITION OF PRIVACY THAT 
MADE SWITZERLAND A BANKING CENTER HAS DRAWN MORE THAN 600 RELIGIOUS GROUPS. BUT 
SCHOLARS NOTE CULT TRAGEDIES LIKE THE ONE LAST WEEK COULD HAPPEN ALMOST 
ANYWHERE.

<P>
 In this tiny Swiss village, farmer Claude Torche personifies the national 
character. Sure, he said, he had seen some of the people who lived in the 
farmhouse on the hill. But he minded his own business. And he had no idea it 
was a cult until firefighters found 23 bullet-riddled bodies there. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheiry, population 240, "is a quiet place," Torche explained the next day as 
he milked his cows. "And something like this, well, it's especially strange for 
Switzerland." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, though, Torche admitted that he had more than a passing 
acquaintance with that farmhouse. His own sister-in-law and nephew had been 
living there, and were probably among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 As investigators continue their worldwide search for clues in the deaths of 53 
people aligned with Luc Jouret's Order of the Solar Temple, one thing has 
become clear: The white-collar sect found Switzerland a country tailor-made for 
secretive cult operations. 
</P>
<P>
 This nation of 7 million people, a mountainous gem smaller than San Bernardino 
County, has a well-founded image of peace and prosperity. But growing furiously 
amid the bucolic green pastures, where cowbells echo off snowcapped peaks, are 
more than 600 religious sects, experts say. And that number, the most of any 
European country, represents a fourfold increase in the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those gnostic groups, many of which trace their ancestry to pagan and early 
Christian sects, "find a safe place in Switzerland," said Massimo Introvigne, 
head of the Center for Studies on New Religions, an international organization 
of scholars based just over the Alps in Turin, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the two bases of Jouret's sect -- Geneva, Switzerland's third-largest 
city, and Montreal, Canada's second-largest -- "have the richest variety of 
esoteric and gnostic groups in the world," Introvigne added. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizations, which count about 200,000 members in Switzerland, find 
comfort in this nation's renowned banking privacy laws and its international 
flavor, as well as its three official languages -- French, German and Italian. 
</P>
<P>
 But the country also is fertile ground because of its centuries-old tradition 
of religious tolerance and the very nature of its people. The Swiss are 
fiercely independent and intensely private; it came as little surprise to many 
here that a cult could flourish in the smallest of villages without being 
noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Swiss also are wealthy and, as in other Western nations, spiritual 
searchers, increasingly dissatisfied with organized religion and preferring 
small groups to Europe's ornate churches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a worrying trend," said Joachim Muller, head of the Swiss (Catholic) 
Bishops Conference study group on sects. "Our people are looking for a sense of 
life, but they are very individual. And there are quite a number creating their 
own religious movements." 
</P>
<P>
 That was how the Order of the Solar Temple began, in the early 1980s, with Luc 
Jouret's homeopathic medical practice in Geneva. It ended last week with what 
the group itself said was both suicide and murder -- suicide for the inner 
circle of true believers and murder for those not yet "fully evolved," for 
their own good. 
</P>
<P>
 In Geneva, an international crossroads, Jouret came in contact with the occult 
world and a range of foreigners, many of them well-heeled. He became a popular 
lecturer in alternative medicine and ecology in Geneva, as well as Montreal, 
Martinique and, later, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 He used those lectures to recruit followers to an organization he called Club 
Amenta. Later, he formed a new group, Club Archedia, with initiation rites and 
a clear hierarchy, for those truly committed to his gospel of apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the most devoted members of Club Archedia were invited into the secret 
inner circle, which became known as the Solar Temple. Like many similar 
organizations, it traced its roots to the Knights Templar, a 12th-Century 
Catholic religious and military order that became powerful during the Crusades 
but was persecuted by the king of France and then dissolved by Pope Clement V 
in the early 14th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, Jouret's adherents believed that in 1981 a "hidden hierarchy" of 
the "Universal Solar Temple" had manifested itself to Jouret and a select few 
in Geneva. Seven "entities" from that hierarchy, which had been hidden in the 
Great Pyramids in Egypt, left Earth in 1993. And the last three left Australia 
earlier this year, paving the way for the group's "transit" to "the absolute 
dimension of truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Jouret's role, according to the documents, was to lead the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are investigating allegations that the group laundered money and 
engaged in international arms dealing. However, experts say those activities, 
even if proven, were probably simply part of the group's efforts to raise money 
and protect itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people believed in their ideology," said Introvigne, who has written 24 
books on religious sects. "It wasn't just a front for making money. I doubt 
this esoteric mishmash of ideology was built just to cover a money-laundering 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Seemingly supporting that thesis has been the discovery among the victims of 
the bodies of Joseph di Mambro, 70, Jouret's chief aide, and Camille Pilet, the 
group's financial controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Jouret's body has not yet been identified and, officially, an international 
warrant for his arrest remains in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't be the first time that a leader masterminded a suicide and then 
didn't kill himself," Introvigne said. "He could easily find some theological 
justification for remaining behind." 
</P>
<P>
 There was evidence of dissension in the group before the deaths, although 
whether it was over money or personalities or theology no one is sure. But it 
is clear, from the group's own writings, that murder as well as suicide was on 
its agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents mailed to Lausanne around the time of the killings, to Swiss 
historian Jean-Francois Mayer, secretary of Introvigne's center and the leading 
expert on the Solar Temple, are "materially genuine," say scholars who have 
studied them in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 In those writings, the Solar Temple said the true believers intended to 
voluntarily "translate to another plane," apparently by mass suicide, and 
destroy their homes. But the documents acknowledged that some in the group had 
not yet understood that "leaving this world is necessary" and would need to be 
gently helped to die for their own benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Lastly, the group wrote that those who intended to betray the Temple leaders 
would "not escape their just retribution." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 53 victims, at least 20 were shot to death and one of them, here in 
Cheiry, had eight bullet wounds. Three in Canada, including a 3-month-old boy, 
were stabbed to death. Two in Canada were burned alive. And the remainder had 
either been suffocated with plastic trash bags or killed by injections of 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe that at least one person, and perhaps more, were present 
at all three locations -- near Montreal in Canada, at the Cheiry farmhouse and 
at three ski chalets in Granges-sur-Salvan, Switzerland -- just before fires 
broke out at each site. In fact, the couple believed responsible for the three 
stabbing deaths in Canada were found dead in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard for some here to imagine that Jouret and his fellow Temple members 
could look at the splendor of the Swiss countryside and conclude that the end 
of humanity was nigh. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have quite a special country," said Muller, of the Swiss Bishop's 
Conference. "But for some of these groups, even Switzerland is a rough sea. 
Their anxiety grows and all logical thinking disappears. They figure that mass 
murder or suicide is the only way to escape these rough seas." 
</P>
<P>
 When John Calvin formed his church in Geneva in 1541, founded on his Christian 
Protestant doctrine, he was drawn there by the country's prosperity, but also 
its essential characteristics of "conformity, tedium and banality," as one 
historian put it. Even in those days, though, Geneva was a hotbed of fanatical 
religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 It is especially difficult to apply national stereotypes in Europe, where 
television and other cultural forces have created a more cosmopolitan 
environment. But the Swiss remain an independent, politically conservative 
people. They stayed steadfastly neutral during World War II and, even today, 
have resisted joining the European Union, defending their place as the world's 
Sonderfall , or special case. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other countries in Europe, Switzerland does not have a single national 
identity. Rather, it is a collection of highly autonomous communities in 26 
separate cantons, or states. In the canton that includes Geneva, for example, 
the law mandates a distinct separation between church and state. 
</P>
<P>
 The states also respect each other's sovereignty and, perhaps more important, 
the Swiss respect one another's privacy. The nation's unwritten law is that 
people don't snoop and they don't ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, Switzerland has always been a great place to hide, for religious 
zealots but also for political exiles, artists and shady financiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Luc Godard, the New Wave filmmaker, finds his apartment on Lake Geneva an 
ideal place for quiet creativity. When Charlie Chaplin was kicked out of the 
United States, he found solace in Vevey, on the same lake, where he later died. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why Switzerland? Because it is a very quiet place known for its cuckoo clocks 
and chocolate," said Marie Geneve, of the IKOR Center, which follows religious 
sects in Europe from offices in Paris. "Switzerland is a landmark because some 
of these sects are interested in money. And . . . because there is great 
religious tolerance." 
</P>
<P>
 But scholars believe that such a massacre could have happened anywhere that 
such little-known sects operate, especially among groups that believe they are 
being persecuted by the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Gordon Melton, of the Institute for the Study of American Religion in Santa 
Barbara, says the killings suggest that authorities everywhere should listen 
more to serious religious scholars and pay less attention to militant anti-cult 
movements, who focus their attention on law-abiding movements, such as the 
Unification Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tragedy should tell governments to keep in closer touch with 
international scholars, who knew quite a few things about the Solar Temple," 
Melton wrote in a paper presented with Introvigne at the Communal Studies 
Conference in Oneida, N.Y., last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pseudo-experts lead authorities astray, thus diverting resources from 
watching the small minority of apocalyptic-occult groups where real dangers may 
be involved," Melton added. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of small religious sects in Switzerland is reflected worldwide, 
where experts say more than 800 new spiritual groups appear every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man doesn't live by bread alone," said Jean Vernette, a priest in France and 
author of 30 books on religious sects. "He needs a spiritual dimension, and 
that opens the door to all sorts of crazy religions."

POLLUTED OIL REFINERY ONCE PART-OWNED BY HUFFINGTON; ENVIRONMENT: HUFFCO 
SUBSIDIARY HELD 20%. THE CANDIDATE AND OTHERS SAY HE HAD NO ACTIVE ROLE IN THE 
PLANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Paramount oil refinery that was owned in part by U.S. Senate candidate Mike 
Huffington and his family during the 1980s left behind a trail of environmental 
damage that could cost millions of dollars to clean up, court records and 
interviews show. 
</P>
<P>
 The pollution is believed to have started decades ago, but may have continued 
during the nearly five years that a Huffington family company held a minority 
interest in the refinery. Although health experts see no "imminent" danger at 
the Paramount Petroleum site, they say pollutants have been found in high 
levels in nearby soil and ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's family company, which earned the onetime Texas oilman a fortune 
that he is now putting to use in his campaign, owned 20% of the Southland 
refinery when the problems were first discovered in the mid-1980s. But 
approximately $70 million in debt and a dim economic future drove Paramount 
into bankruptcy at the urging of the Huffingtons' firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The state filed a $15-million claim against Paramount in 1988, seeking to use 
its assets to pay for cleanup and "to protect the public health and safety." 
But the company quickly challenged the claim because it was filed 2 1/2 years 
late in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles, and it was dismissed. A 
subsidiary of Huffco, the Huffington family company, was one of three 
shareholders at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said in an interview that he never supported the project that led 
to his family company's 4 1/2-year ownership interest in the refinery and that 
even while he oversaw all finances at the family company, he never became aware 
of any environmental claims in Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those things I don't know about. It was handled by other people," said the 
Santa Barbara congressman, whose account was supported by former Huffco 
officials and a bankruptcy trustee who oversaw the refinery. "It was too long 
ago for me to remember . . . and it really has nothing to do with this 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has made corporate responsibility a central theme in his bid to 
unseat Sen. Dianne Feinstein, arguing that government should ease its 
regulatory stranglehold over business and allow the private sector, on its own, 
to assume greater fiscal roles in society. 
</P>
<P>
 But some critics point to the environmental problems at the Paramount refinery 
as evidence that the approach won't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Trumbull, a San Jose environmental lawyer who has represented the city 
of Paramount in the case for seven years, estimates that the city spent a 
half-million dollars in an unsuccessful legal effort to hold the previous 
owners, including Huffco's California subsidiary, responsible for the damage. 
He said that if the refinery's current owners do not undertake the cleanup on 
their own, public agencies may have to bear the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, going into the bankruptcy washed away (the previous owners') 
liability," Trumbull said. "That may be standard operating procedure for any 
big business, but to create a subsidiary and hoist 50 or 60 million dollars in 
(potential) liability on taxpayers, I view that as utterly reprehensible. . . . 
It stinks pretty badly." 
</P>
<P>
 Questions surrounding the bankruptcy became fodder for Feinstein in the 
campaign after it was disclosed last month that the state made a 1988 claim 
against Paramount for nearly $7 million in back taxes allegedly owed by a 
Huffco subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 The state was unable to collect on that claim, either, and Huffington 
maintains that his company never had any tax debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paramount refinery sits on a 60-acre site on Downey Avenue in southeast 
Los Angeles, surrounded by nearby homes, a newly opened Wal-Mart, two schools 
and a municipal golf course. Environmental experts say the pollution at the 
Paramount site probably began at the time of the refinery's founding in the 
1940s, decades before Huffco assumed an interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But continued operations during the 1980s may well have exacerbated the 
problem, they say. Moreover, both federal and state environmental laws hold 
that any owners of a hazardous site can be found responsible for damages, even 
if others before them may have contributed to it. Previous owners can be held 
liable as well if they are found to have polluted the site. 
</P>
<P>
 William W. Pennell, a bankruptcy trustee appointed in 1984 to oversee the 
refinery's day-to-day operations, said he never saw a serious environmental 
problem at the site, despite a bevy of periodic test results that suggested 
otherwise. The state's $15-million claim, he said in an interview, "was 
nonsense then and it's nonsense now. There was some contamination, sure, but to 
file a claim of any amount was pure conjecture." 
</P>
<P>
 Trumbull, from the city of Paramount legal team, believes the issue never got 
a full airing in bankruptcy court, and he blames that on bungling in 
Sacramento: After filing their claim 2 1/2 years past the court cutoff, he 
said, lawyers for the state did not even show up for a hearing, leaving the 
city to fend for itself in pressing the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were extremely upset," he said. "I think the state just completely fouled 
it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelo Bellomo, then head of the Southern California office for the state's 
Toxic Substances Control Division, did not recall details of the claim. But he 
said of Trumbull's explanation: "That doesn't surprise me. The workload during 
that period of time was so heavy, a lot of things fell through the cracks, and 
that obviously seems like one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 A Huffco subsidiary became part owner of Paramount through its California 
subsidiary in 1984 in an ill-fated attempt to forestall financial troubles at a 
refinery the family had started in Bakersfield a few years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffco, the Houston oil conglomerate founded by Huffington's wildcatter 
father, was already making millions from gas operations in Indonesia, but 
California oil production offered a way to expand the firm's operations. Begun 
in 1980, the $135-million Bakersfield refinery was designed to process heavy 
crude oil from the San Joaquin Valley and pipe it to the Los Angeles Basin for 
use as gasoline, jet fuel and other petroleum products. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington and his associates say he had opposed the Bakersfield project, 
warning his father that it could be an economic flop, and events proved him 
right. A drop in the price of oil and problems with contractors plagued the 
refinery from the start, and Huffco soon merged the operation with the 
Paramount refinery in a stock transfer that created an instant Los Angeles 
outlet for its crude product. In addition to the Huffco subsidiary's 20% 
interest, Mid-Pacific Resources Inc. and Pasco Inc., a company associated with 
international arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, each ended up with a 40% share of 
Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 But within months of the 1984 merger the debt-loaded refinery was already 
considering bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huffco subsidiary recommended bankruptcy, but one of the partners blocked 
the move, the trustee said in a report to the court. It was finally left to the 
company's banking creditors, who held $48 million in loans on the Bakersfield 
and Paramount refineries, to break the stalemate and push Paramount into an 
involuntary Chapter 11 filing through a petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 
Los Angeles. Huffington had worked for one of the banking creditors early in 
his career, and his father was a director at a second bank in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennell, the bankruptcy trustee, said the Huffingtons played little role in 
Paramount during its four years in bankruptcy protection and that he never even 
met any of the family members. "They were totally benign in this whole affair. 
. . . I wouldn't know (Mike Huffington) if he fell on me," Pennell said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Huffco officials said the Texas company took such a distanced role from 
the refinery operations that they were never even aware of any potential 
environmental problems at the site or any claim by the state for damages from 
the estate. Huffco was sold to Taiwan's nationalized oil company in 1990, with 
Mike Huffington earning an estimated $70-million share in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is this," former Huffco President Lorne Bain said in an 
interview. "The Huffington family and Mike Huffington had no involvement in the 
Paramount business interests at all. . . . There was no tie back to us." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Huffco subsidiary did hold voting seats on the Paramount board, and 
Huffington himself oversaw financing for the Bakersfield deal and the 
bankruptcy negotiations that followed it. The congressman, however, suggested 
that his company's role in the refinery was so minimal that it would be unfair 
to question its responsibility -- legal or otherwise -- for problems there. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have shares in Exxon, do you have an ethical responsibility to help 
clean up the Valdez disaster?" the congressman asked. "I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of health problems around oil facilities became almost 
commonplace in California during the 1980s as the state moved to toughen its 
environmental oversight. Paramount Petroleum, in fact, was one of 15 Southland 
refineries ordered by water quality officials to begin extensive soil and 
ground water testing because of suspected problems. 
</P>
<P>
 As far back as 1985, soon after Huffco assumed a stake in the company, the 
testing at Paramount detected the presence of underground oil pools floating on 
top of the local ground water supply. Within four years, water officials found 
that contaminants had begun to spread off the site and recommended that cleanup 
should begin "as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 But efforts by government agencies and the refinery owners have lagged, and 
even today no major cleanup has begun and no final plan for the work has been 
submitted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the problem has only grown. Ongoing tests filed this year 
with the state found arsenic and chloride contamination in each of 21 ground 
water wells sampled around the refinery. And levels for benzene, a carcinogen 
found in gas and linked to leukemia and other diseases, came in as high as 
15,000 times the state's accepted levels for drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 The real problem, said Jim Ross, senior engineer for the Los Angeles Regional 
Water Quality Control Board, will come if the contaminants are allowed to seep 
into a local aquifer and reach local drinking water supplies. "There is not an 
imminent danger to the community," he said, "but it certainly has the potential 
to be if it lingers." 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates through the years for the cost of a full-scale cleanup have started 
at about $6 million, but Ross said the Paramount operation would surely tally 
in the "tens of millions." He said the job would be similar to ongoing work at 
another polluted Los Angeles refinery with "nearly identical problems," and 
cleanup costs there will probably reach $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The current owners of the Paramount refinery promise to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Lingle, current president of Paramount Petroleum, said the refinery has 
only undertaken "minor" cleanup to date, but it has set aside more than $10 
million over the next five or six years for more extensive soil and water work 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will pay for the project without public monies, he pledged, and it 
hopes to "go back to anyone who owned it over the years" to help cover the 
costs. "I don't want to pay for it out of my own pocket if I don't have to," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount City Manager Pat West said he has been impressed by the new 
ownership's cooperation. But Trumbull and others in the protracted case are 
wary, saying they have heard similar pledges before: The company that bought 
Paramount for $43 million in 1988 and took it out of bankruptcy also pledged a 
full cleanup, only to file for bankruptcy itself soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the risk that was created by not using the assets from the bankruptcy 
in '88 . . . and doing the work when we should have," Trumbull said. "The 
bottom line is that somebody's going to have to clean it up."

'DREAM TEAM' TRIO OUTLINE PLANS FOR STUDIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON and CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Describing themselves as Hollywood's version of the "dream team," 
entertainment executives Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen 
on Wednesday confirmed plans to launch a company from the ground up that will 
compete with the major studios. 
</P>
<P>
 The unnamed company will be financed by the three partners in the early stages 
-- although sources said other investors from the communications world may 
eventually sign on. It will focus on five major areas: movie and TV production, 
animation, music and multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all going to do what we've been doing," Spielberg said at a packed 
Beverly Hills news conference Wednesday morning. "We're just going to hopefully 
do it better." 
</P>
<P>
 News of their plans rocked the Hollywood community. Katzenberg, Spielberg and 
Geffen are the most powerful creative executives to combine forces behind a new 
entertainment company in recent memory -- perhaps the most powerful since 
Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D. W. Griffith combined 
to form United Artists at the birth of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 If the trio prevails, theirs will be the first studio successfully launched in 
more than a decade. They may also help to transform the way business is done in 
Hollywood, since the company is structured as a streamlined alternative to its 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can really pull this off, it will change the face of the industry," 
said filmmaker Bob Zemeckis, a friend of Spielberg and collaborator on such 
hits as the "Back to the Future" film series and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" 
Zemeckis, whose "Forrest Gump" has grossed more than $270 million at the box 
office, added, "They are a unique mixture. We haven't seen anything like this 
since the old UA days. These are three guys are passionate about movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg, the former Walt Disney Studios chief who had hits such as "The 
Lion King" and "Pretty Woman" to his credit before a falling out with company 
Chairman Michael D. Eisner, is expected to manage the day-to-day operations of 
the company. Spielberg, the most successful director in Hollywood history 
("Jaws," "E.T.," "Jurassic Park") will fold his Amblin Entertainment into the 
company after fulfilling existing commitments, but will still take directing 
jobs with other studios. Geffen, who created Asylum and Geffen Records, will 
launch a record label there. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, at least, they said they will focus on quality over volume. 
Spielberg said the company would be "about ideas" and a happy "playground" for 
creative talent. Katzenberg added that there will be no limit on budgets or the 
level of talent they will work with. 
</P>
<P>
 The executives said they intend to be very hands-on at the company, but 
sources pointed out that not everything they touch has turned to gold. 
Katzenberg suffered through years of live-action losers at Disney, including 
"Blank Check" and "Cabin Boy." In addition to his many hits, Spielberg has had 
his name on disappointments such as "Always" and "Empire of the Sun." And 
Geffen has distanced himself from the operations of his record company in 
recent years, leading some to question whether he can build another label. 
</P>
<P>
 Egos may also become a factor as the company moves forward, since the partners 
are known as three of the most controlling executives in Hollywood. Speaking of 
their futures, Katzenberg said: "We're looking at this as a lifetime commitment 
for the three of us." Said Spielberg: "We're interested in creating a company 
that will outlive us all." Added Geffen: "I've always been on my own, but this 
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with partners. . . . I haven't had 
this much anxiety in 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has Hollywood seen such an ambitious new company born in many years. 
Barbra Streisand, Sidney Portier and Paul Newman created First Artists 
Production Co. in 1969 -- and failed. Director/producer Francis Ford Coppola 
also failed with his filmmaker-friendly American Zoetrope studio in the 1980s. 
Orion Pictures, formed in 1978, had a run of success until a string of bad 
movies led to a bankruptcy filing in 1992. TriStar Pictures, formed by CBS, 
Home Box Office and Columbia Pictures in 1983, lives on as a subsidiary of 
troubled Sony Pictures Entertainment. And Savoy Pictures, the most recent 
entry, is still establishing itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen hope to get a leg up by making their company 
leaner, faster-moving and more financially creative than the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking Disney's virtual lock on animation is one goal. Spielberg and 
Katzenberg said feature animation will be a cornerstone of the company. 
"Jeffrey and I have been horrendously competitive for years, and my appetite 
for animation has not diminished," said Spielberg, who made "Roger Rabbit" for 
Katzenberg at Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 TV is another area where the company is expected to be aggressive and 
innovative. Sources say that it will be willing to offer more favorable 
financial terms to the networks than its competitors. Katzenberg is known to 
have strong ties to executives at Capital Cities/ABC. Moreover, the partners 
have not ruled out a bid for a network. 
</P>
<P>
 Multimedia is a special interest of Spielberg's. The director already has a 
deal with Knowledge Adventure, a multimedia software company. But he said that 
would not preclude him from working on separate projects for the new company. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical problem for start-up companies is financing, since it takes years to 
build up the libraries that see established studios through the lean times. But 
competitors say the Katzenberg-Spielberg-Geffen team will probably clear that 
hurdle too. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a powerful force because the three of them are all so unique and so 
good at what they do," said Robert Daly, Warner Bros. co-chairman. "They're 
starting from scratch, so this won't be something you'll see tomorrow. But are 
they a major competitor? Absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Paramount Pictures Chief Sherry Lansing: "It's the most amazing 
combination of geniuses . . . I think they can do anything they set their minds 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is as if Babe Ruth, Lou Gerhig and Joe DiMaggio got together," said 
Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein. "It's the entertainment hall of fame of 
all time." 
</P>
<P>
 Details about the new company are sketchy, because it was pulled together very 
quickly. But sources say it is likely to align itself initially with Universal 
Pictures parent MCA Inc., where Spielberg and Geffen have long-running ties. 
Spielberg's company is based there, in an adobe complex built for him after the 
success of "E.T." Geffen, who sold his record company to MCA, works there under 
a contract ending this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that any ties between the new company and MCA are predicated on 
MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman and President Sidney J. Sheinberg remaining in 
place. Both are in the midst of contract discussions. Sources said the new 
company could use MCA for everything from theatrical distribution and 
merchandising services to video and pay TV deals. 
</P>
<P>
 There was even speculation that Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen eventually 
will try to purchase a controlling stake in MCA from its parent, Matsushita 
Electric Industrial Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope MCA would continue to have a relationship with this entity if 
it's considered appropriate by them and us," said Sheinberg, who was attending 
an MCA management retreat. "We would look forward to being able to do that and 
I think they would too." 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg described the new company as a "sovereign state." But it was one 
that was formed very quickly. The contracts were signed only three days ago, 
and it was only six weeks ago that Katzenberg was forced out at Disney after an 
unsuccessful bid to be named president of the parent company. Katzenberg's 
career campaign resulted in a very public feud with Eisner, whom he had worked 
with for 19 years, beginning at Paramount Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 After exploring three options -- fixing a troubled company, expanding an 
existing successful company or starting his own enterprise with partners -- 
Katzenberg decided on a new company, telling one confidant: "At the end of the 
day I asked myself, 'Do I want to get involved in somebody else's creation?' . 
. . This is getting up on the high wire and literally putting ourselves at risk 
with the challenge and rewards of trying to build something from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg and Geffen are Katzenberg's two best friends. The entrepreneurial 
Geffen had been pushing Katzenberg to go into business with him. Spielberg, who 
had always resisted overtures to form his own company, also was open to the 
idea of teaming up. He and Katzenberg are already partners in DIVE!, a 
restaurant venture that's designed to become a national chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Tom Hanks on Wednesday jokingly told Spielberg they should call their 
new venture "DIVE! -- the Studio." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg relayed a story at the news conference about how he and his wife, 
actress Kate Capshaw, were visiting Zemeckis and his wife at their vacation 
house in Jamaica when he learned that Katzenberg was leaving Disney. According 
to Zemeckis, Katzenberg suggested at that time that Katzenberg and Spielberg 
should start a studio. "I don't know if it was a joke or if Jeffrey was half 
kidding, but I think the seed my have been planted," Zemeckis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg said Eisner called all three to congratulate them on the new 
company Wednesday morning. He added that his rift with Eisner is healing "and 
that the hurt's behind us." However, Katzenberg has retained lawyers to 
negotiate a settlement of his contract with Disney, and many people expect the 
multimillion-dollar disagreement to end up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's news conference not only drew one of the largest media crowds 
covering an entertainment related announcement, but an uncharacteristically 
large collection of Hollywood power brokers including Michael Ovitz and Ron 
Meyer, whose Creative Artists Agency represents Spielberg, International 
Creative Management President Jim Wiatt and United Talent Agency partner Jim 
Berkus and several of Katzenberg's still-loyal Disney executives. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company still lacks headquarters and a staff, as well as clear, 
long-term financing. Sources familiar with entertainment funding said it will 
need $1.5 billion to $2 billion in capital to go forward with its ambitious 
plans. No one believes that the partners will foot the entire bill, even though 
Spielberg and Geffen are personally capable of doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg said the company will not go public. Sources agreed that the three 
executives can raise all the money they need from private sources, and that a 
public offering would expose them to more scrutiny than they're likely to be 
willing to put up with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think that Katzenberg would very much want to avoid the public 
forum," one source said. "The results are too publicly known. He needs to keep 
his aura about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Should they change their minds, raising money publicly will also be easier 
once the company is up and running, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting a movie into theaters from scratch can take as long as 18 months, but 
the new company could accelerate that timeline by acquiring existing projects 
other studios have soured on. Amblin and Geffen Films also have projects in the 
works. Sources pointed out that Disney, which has said that it plans to scale 
back production, could find a willing buyer for its orphaned projects in 
Katzenberg. Given their recent bad blood, however, Eisner may not be anxious to 
jump-start Katzenberg's company. 
</P>
<P>
 "One significant question is whether Eisner allows anything to go to 
Katzenberg," said one source. "If I were Eisner, I wouldn't put anything in 
turnaround."

WILSON INCREASES LEAD OVER BROWN, POLL SHOWS; TIMES POLL: THE CHALLENGER'S 
FAVORABILITY RATING DROPS AFTER SHE IS OUTSPENT BY THE GOVERNOR ON TV 
ADVERTISING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With less than a month left before Californians go to the polls, incumbent 
Gov. Pete Wilson has solidified his lead over Democratic challenger Kathleen 
Brown, the one-time leader in the race whose candidacy is being viewed with 
increasing skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Among registered voters, Wilson leads by 8 points, 50%-42%. The margin expands 
to 13 points among voters considered likely to cast ballots, 54%-41%. When the 
last Times survey was taken a month ago, Wilson led by 2 points among 
registered voters and 9 points among likely voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Conducted Oct. 8-11, the poll showed that the California political environment 
is little changed from September. Voters still believe that the economy is in 
dire straits, and they still consider Republicans only slightly better at 
handling the state's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the contest for governor, Brown's image has apparently fallen victim to 
a relentless drubbing by Wilson in campaign appearances and television 
commercials. For the first time since she became a fixture in Times polling, 
Brown's favorability rating is a net negative, with 42% having an unfavorable 
view of her to 39% favorable. A month ago, before Wilson began outspending 
Brown on television, the situation was reversed at 46% positive and 33% 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, meanwhile, remains less than popular, with a 49% unfavorable rating to 
47% favorable -- virtually unchanged since September. Just 44% of voters 
approved of the way Wilson is handling his job, unchanged since last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilson has not succeeded in making people feel better about himself, the 
state or the economy," said Poll Director John Brennan. "The only thing 
different is that Kathleen Brown is less popular." 
</P>
<P>
 A general dismay about the campaign on the part of the electorate was 
reflected when respondents were asked whether they were voting for a candidate 
they liked. Only 37% answered affirmatively, and 59% -- three of every five 
voters -- said their candidate was the "lesser of two evils." That held true 
for both Brown and Wilson supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, President Clinton's job approval rating among California voters 
moved only slightly in the last month to 49% -- from 44% in September -- a span 
of time that has been dominated by U.S. intervention in Haiti and along the 
Kuwaiti border with Iraq. The percentage of registered voters disapproving his 
handling of the presidency fell from 49% to 46%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll questioned 1,232 registered voters, of whom 821 are considered 
to be likely voters Nov. 8. The margin of sampling error for registered voters 
is 3 percentage points in either direction; for likely voters it is 4 points in 
either direction. Margins of error for smaller subgroups of voters may be 
larger. 
</P>
<P>
 For Brown, who has seen her early and ephemeral lead in polling dissolve as 
the campaign came into focus, the Times Poll results were almost exclusively 
negative. She managed to increase her standing notably only among college 
graduates and those making more than $60,000 annually, while Wilson's 
consolidation of support occurred almost across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Among self-described liberals, his support increased by six points to 23%. The 
governor saw strong improvements among those making less than $20,000, 41% of 
whom support him compared to 30% a month ago. And among the key bloc of voters 
aged 45-64, his support rose from 47% to 58%. 
</P>
<P>
 Strikingly, Brown lost ground among Democratic women, the one voter group her 
campaign has expected to have in its pocket. Support for Wilson there rose to 
27%, up from 19% in the Times Poll's September survey. Brown's level of support 
dropped three points to 64%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's standing was all the more surprising given the lackluster sentiments 
of voters about the state that he has led for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, nearly two-thirds of registered voters said things in California are 
running down the wrong track -- a statement that generally gives incumbents a 
shaky perch from which to campaign for reelection. The figure was almost 
exactly that seen in September and in Times polls conducted since last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether they believe that the state is in a recession, 84% agreed, the 
same percentage as in September. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a glimmer of hope expressed about the future of California, however. 
When asked in September whether they thought the California economy would be in 
better shape three months hence, only 22% of voters said it would. This month, 
the percentage rose to 27%. Ten percent of registered voters said they thought 
it would be worse -- about the same as September's 9% -- and most people felt 
that the economy would be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans continued to be considered, by a razor-thin margin of 37% to 33%, 
the party best equipped to handle the problems facing California. That was 
similar to the margin seen a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Poll Director Brennan characterized Wilson's lead in the race as noteworthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's remarkable Wilson is doing this well, given the pessimism in the state 
and his own lackluster ratings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for Wilson's success in the poll may be the comparative 
confidence voters place in him to handle the most pressing issues facing the 
state. Wilson continues to control three of the four most important issues, as 
defined by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's recent advertising that sought to connect Kathleen Brown with 
her brother Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. in her prospective handling of the 
criminal justice system has clearly had an impact with the electorate. The ads 
reminded voters that former Gov. Brown named Rose Elizabeth Bird to the state 
Supreme Court, from which she voted to overturn scores of death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
 By a huge 58%-22% margin, voters believe Wilson is best equipped to handle the 
state's crime problems. That constitutes a 10-point change from September's 
50%-24% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue most important to voters, the economy, Wilson edged Brown 46-34%, 
the same margin as last month. But it could not have been good news for Brown, 
since she has spent the last week hawking her plan to salvage the state's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 On immigration, Wilson holds the cards by 53% to 27%, again about the same 
margin as September's 49%-22%. Brown continues to do well as the candidate best 
suited to handle education, beating Wilson by a solid 20 points, 46%-26%. That 
remained unchanged from a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates also split on two markers of personal style. Wilson was 
described as having the best leadership traits, by a 49%-28% margin that 
reflected slight slippage on the part of Brown. She was judged the candidate 
who is more empathetic, by a 43%-29% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulties faced by Brown as she seeks to put together a winning 
coalition of voters were evident when the poll results were broken down into 
demographic groups. Campaign strategists generally concede the extremes -- 
liberals to Democrats, conservatives to Republicans -- and focus their 
firepower on the majority of voters who reside in the moderate camps, such as 
non-liberal Democrats or non-conservative Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 In this poll, Wilson had the support of 37% of non-liberal Democrats, those 
willing to cross party lines to vote for him. Brown, in contrast, had the 
support of only 19% of non-conservative Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the electorate another way -- by registration -- Wilson made small 
gains among Republicans, Democrats and registered independents. Brown lost 
among independents and had no net gain among Republicans or Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll also probed the leanings of those who said they liked both 
candidates, and those who disapproved of both candidates. Among the 9% of 
voters who said they felt favorably about both Wilson and Brown, more than half 
said they would vote for Wilson. Among the 12% of voters who disliked both, 59% 
said they would vote for Wilson and 25% would vote for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 One last bit of bad news for Brown: Her opposition to Proposition 187, the 
anti-illegal immigration initiative, has the potential to hurt her more than 
help her with voters. Told that Brown opposes the measure, 33% of voters say 
they are less inclined to support her while just 18% are more inclined. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, conversely, could benefit from backing Proposition 187. A third of 
voters are more inclined to support him because of his endorsement while just 
20% would oppose him. Wilson continues to draw the support of close to 
one-third of the state's Latino voters, which suggests that there has as yet 
been no backlash against him for his stand.

 * TOO CLOSE TO CALL: Undecided voters are key to many state contests. A3 How 
the Poll Was Conducted The Times Poll interviewed 1,641 adults statewide, by 
telephone, Oct. 8-11. Included in the sample are 1,232 registered voters and 
821 likely voters. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges 
in the state. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and 
unlisted numbers could be contacted. The sample was weighted slightly to 
conform more closely with census figures for sex, race, age and education. 
Interviewing was conducted in English and Spanish. The margin of sampling error 
for the total sample and the sample of all registered voters is plus or minus 3 
percentage points; for likely voters it is 4 points. For certain subgroups the 
error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by other 
factors such as question wording and the order in which questions are 
presented. THE TIMES POLL: Wilson Gaining Over Brown

CAMPAIGN JOURNAL / CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; BROWN FORAGES FOR VOTES ON RADIO SHOW 
KNOWN FOR ANTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Kathleen Brown had been the guest on the radio talk show for barely 30 seconds 
when she exclaimed in mock horror: "This is NOT Michael Jackson! Not even 
close. Not even close." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed not. Michael Jackson -- the other Michael Jackson -- is the respectful, 
erudite 28-year veteran of that rival talk station, KABC. On this Tuesday 
evening, the state treasurer and Democratic nominee for governor of California 
was the guest of Stephanie Miller, the hyper, brash, ribald host from 7 to 9 
p.m. each weeknight on KFI, which boasts of "more STIM-u-lat-ing" talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Brown seemed to be blanching a bit. And Miller hadn't even got to 
her description of Atty. Gen. Janet Reno's border crackdown as "Operation 
Kick-Ass, or something, I don't know . . ." Or her jibes at Republican Gov. 
Pete Wilson as the testosterone candidate they wind up with a screw in the back 
of his head. "Maybe he has a little microchip back there," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 No one mentioned the time Miller had her breasts cast in plaster -- live, over 
50,000 watts -- for the making of a bronze bust, so to speak, for a charity 
auction. Or how she makes a lusty, purring sound in her throat to the men who 
call in. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Brown said she knew that the Miller show would be freewheeling, 
but that she was not worried about embarrassment or falling into rhetorical 
quicksand. There always are risks, she said, but "I am one who believes you 
have got to get out there and take your message to the people." 
</P>
<P>
 And it was fun, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an election-year atmosphere fraught with peril, radio talk shows in fierce 
battles for ratings can become a candidate's worst nightmare -- a political 
"Jaws." 
</P>
<P>
 KFI also is the station of Rush Limbaugh and local hosts such as John Kobylt 
and Ken Chiampou, who routinely skewer politicians as hacks and treat political 
guests as red meat to be thrown to the mob. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Tom Umberg of Garden Grove, now the Democratic nominee for 
attorney general, was virtually eviscerated when he went on "The John and Ken 
Show" during the "three strikes" debate this year. 
</P>
<P>
 John and Ken lead into the Miller show each evening. Kobylt made it clear this 
week that he thought that sharing their 50,000 watts with Kathleen Brown was a 
waste of time. "A woman without an idea," he sneered. 
</P>
<P>
 What Tuesday night provided, however, was a rare hour of levity in what has 
been a decidedly humorless gubernatorial campaign. In the process, Brown got to 
put her message across -- in serious, schoolmarm fashion, as usual -- but she 
also got in one pretty good impromptu line. 
</P>
<P>
 During a break, Brown learned that Miller's brother, William E. Miller Jr., is 
the Republican nominee in the 29th Congressional District in the Buffalo, N.Y., 
area. That is the House seat once held by their late father, who was Barry 
Goldwater's vice presidential running mate in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's father is former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown and her brother is former 
Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. Kathleen Brown remained in the family 
Democratic mold. Stephanie Miller rebelled against her family's GOP roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the air, Kathleen Brown said: "This is perfect. You have a brother 
who's running for elected office, and I have a brother with a radio talk show. 
We have things in common. We have the Brown-Miller connection." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Miller nightly offers a semi-outrageous mix of staccato stand-up 
comedy, liberal feminism and sexual teasing along with some serious political 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, though, the 33-year-old Miller acknowledged that she was on her 
Catholic schoolgirl best behavior, toning down some of the more raucous aspects 
of her usual show on Brown's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 During those first 30 seconds, all Miller had done was to welcome Brown to the 
studio with the honored sobriquet, "Girlfriend!" and introduced her with cheers 
and applause from all the studio hands. As the show unfolded, she interjected 
at every opportunity: "Vote for Kathleen Brown, vote for Kathleen Brown. . . . 
You are getting sleepy. . . . Vote for Kathleen Brown. . . . I don't care who 
wins -- vote for Kathleen Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the sort of bland, down-the-middle treatment that Brown, or any 
other politician, receives in making the talk show circuit in places such as 
Eureka or Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the half a dozen calls were friendly ones. When Jeff in San Bernardino 
raved over Brown's economic program, Miller chided: "Jeff, you're a bigger 
liberal suck-up than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller told Brown she knew all about the 62-page economic plan: "I've seen you 
hawking those things. It's like Moonies at the airport." 
</P>
<P>
 When the hour was over, Miller and Brown hugged, and Brown left the studio 
west of Downtown for home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next hour, Miller was back to her more sassy self. When Ron of Anaheim 
called to gush -- a little too glibly -- that he thought Miller was a 
"beautiful, intelligent liberal" who was 100% right on the issues, Miller 
retorted tartly: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah ha! This was just a cheap way to get in my pants -- is that the deal, 
Ron?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not Michael Jackson, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also has invited Gov. Wilson to appear on her show. She might even call 
him "Boyfriend!"

CAPITOL JOURNAL: THE IRONY OF FEINSTEIN'S PREDICAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's ironic the California senator who probably set the rookie record for 
achievement -- certainly for a two-year term -- now faces an electorate that 
may not care. Indeed, an electorate that may even hold it against her. 
</P>
<P>
 It's ironic her political achievement reminds voters she's a politician and, 
ergo, for many in this era of alienation, that naturally represents evil. 
Ironic further that in achieving, she has successfully battled against a major 
cause of the alienation: legislative gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironic that this native Californian has trained all her adult life for the job 
and, despite having performed it skillfully, now is in danger of being replaced 
with a newcomer from Texas who virtually ignores the only elective office he 
ever has held. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein knows how to deliver for her constituents -- how to 
cajole, maneuver and deal. It's something Rep. Mike Huffington disdains. 
</P>
<P>
 For "Mrs. Feinstein and her fellow travelers ," he says, uprooting a 
red-baiting anachronism from the McCarthy era, "big government is their god." 
They play "the oldest game in town. It's the 
I'll-scratch-your-back/you-scratch-mine, pork-trading game designed to keep 
politicians forever in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 It's ironic. That's how the game of democracy -- the game of bloodless 
politics -- was set up to be played. Citizens elect somebody to represent them 
at the Capitol and if this politician delivers, he or she gets reelected. But 
maybe not these days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein now is barely ahead of Huffington in the polls after having led last 
March by 30 points. He'll spend perhaps $25 million of his personal fortune by 
Election Day. She's mortgaging her house to augment private donations, but 
probably will spend only half what he does on TV ads. She knows he could beat 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very sobering thought for me," she said in almost a whisper at an 
Art Deco sports bar, where a local supporter had led her after a long 
campaigning day. Political advisers had urged her to forget the California 
Desert Protection Act -- which took many weeks of finagling to get passed -- 
and return home to campaign. Forget the assault rifle ban, which stirred up 
enemies anyway. Don't worry about voting on bills. Worry about your own votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, you know, all my life what I've tried to do is make government work," 
said the former San Francisco mayor. "And there isn't another way for me. I 
figure, look, even if I'm there for just two years, I have left a legacy. I 
have done some things that aren't going to get undone." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she continued, "Does anybody really care?" The senator mentioned a 
$50-million federal waste water grant for Los Angeles that she helped save. 
"Nobody really knows about it." 
</P>
<P>
 She lamented that it's difficult to spread the word on her achievements 
because positive TV ads no longer seem to work. People don't believe the good 
deeds claimed by politicians. And her achievements won't effect voters 
personally until long after the election. So what if she's good at playing the 
congressional game, say the alienated. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein therefore is counterpunching. She's firing negative ads at 
Huffington, as he has been at her for months. "I had to punch back," she said. 
"You reach a point, you either punch back or you go down." 
</P>
<P>
 What does she think of Huffington personally , I asked. She paused a very long 
time, staring into a Campari and soda. Finally in a low voice: "Not very much." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you," she added, leaning forward and referring to the 1990 
gubernatorial race, "I understood losing to Pete Wilson. Here's a man that's a 
part of the state. Was a mayor. Was a United States senator. Really does care. 
It's hard to understand losing to this guy. He doesn't care one whit about the 
state of California." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The day had started in Sacramento, speaking to the Chamber of Commerce. She 
talked of helping to deliver $27 million to the city through the federal crime 
bill. In all, she said, California's share of the federal pie had increased by 
27% during her tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Later at a Chico restaurant, she exclaimed to applauding supporters: "Police 
officers aren't pork. Jails aren't pork. Boot camps aren't pork . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, 50 gun worshipers demonstrated against her assault rifle ban. "You 
don't shoot a deer with an assault weapon if you're any kind of a hunter at 
all," she told the audience. "You only use assault weapons to walk into a room 
like this and mow down people." 
</P>
<P>
 That evening in Eureka, where loggers have lost jobs because of the spotted 
owl, she defended her desert protection bill. It won't cost jobs, she asserted, 
and it will stop people from chipping away at prehistoric dinosaur tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 You couldn't help but wonder whether Feinstein's brand of politics was going 
the way of dinosaurs.

 Radial keratotomy, the controversial surgical technique in which slits are 
made in the surface of the eye to eliminate the need for glasses, is both safe 
and effective, according to results of a 10-year study directed by USC and 
sponsored by the National Eye Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The study's findings, proponents say, may put to rest concerns over the 
procedure. But the results also raise questions about its long-term effects. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of 10 years, 70% of the 374 patients in the study still did not 
need glasses to correct their ability to see objects in the distance. But many 
did require reading glasses sooner than they would have without the surgery, 
according to a report to be published Friday in the Archives of Ophthalmology. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 3% had poorer distance vision a decade after surgery and none had 
catastrophic problems, the scientists reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Imported from the Soviet Union 16 years ago, radial keratotomy has gradually 
increased in popularity. It is designed to correct nearsightedness, a condition 
that affects about 70 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on these findings . . . some people will be pleased with their vision 
shortly after having RK, but their opinion may change five, 10 or 15 years down 
the road," said study leader Dr. Peter J. McDonnell of USC's Doheny Eye 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your primary object is to get rid of your glasses, this technique will 
most likely be successful until you are into your 40s," said Dr. Carl Kupfer, 
director of the National Eye Institute. "But as you age, you'll be a little 
more likely to have to wear reading glasses. . . . This study has provided the 
basic information to allow a patient to make an informed decision" about 
whether to have the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big picture is that RK is a very safe way of significantly improving 
distance vision in a majority of people," said Dr. Robert Maloney of UCLA's 
Jules Stein Eye Institute. "The key number is that 85% of people will have 
vision of 20/40 or better, which is good enough to get a driver's license" 
without eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the study shows that RK is a safe and effective, although not 
perfect, alternative for people who don't want to rely on glasses or contact 
lenses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearsightedness, the cornea -- the lens that focuses light on the 
photoreceptors of the retina -- is slightly thicker in the middle than it 
should be. The result is that light from a distance is focused slightly in 
front of the retina, causing blurring. 
</P>
<P>
 In RK, the surgeon uses a diamond blade under a local anesthetic to make four 
to 16 shallow incisions in the cornea from the center to near the outer edge. 
These incisions cause the cornea to flatten out slightly, refocusing distant 
light on the retina. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-minute procedure typically costs from $1,200 to $1,500 per eye in the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 250,000 people in the United States will have RK surgeries this 
year, up from 30,000 only five years ago. The highest concentration of the 
surgeries is in Texas, California and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The 374 subjects in the study underwent the procedure on each eye at nine 
centers throughout the country. Their vision was evaluated periodically -- a 
process that is still continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 10-year mark, 53% of the eyes had 20/20 vision and 85% had 20/40 vision 
or better. "People with 20/40 vision can get up in the morning and read the 
alarm clock without glasses, drive their car and so forth," Maloney said. "But 
many of these people will still wear glasses for driving at night, for going to 
a movie or a play or for whenever they need to see perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
 The safety demonstrated in the study is also extremely important, researchers 
said. When the procedure was first imported from the Soviet Union, many critics 
predicted occasional disastrous consequence, ranging from blindness to loss of 
the eye. That has not been observed in the study, and the researchers say there 
have been no reported instances of such complications. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 3% of the eyes in the study became more nearsighted after 10 years than 
they were before the surgery, and that decrease in vision was "very tiny," 
McDonnell said. Typically, such subjects' vision -- even with glasses -- would 
decrease by about five points, such as from 20/20 to 20/25, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of the researchers, however, 40% of the subjects became more 
farsighted over the course of the study, and required reading glasses three to 
four years earlier than they would have otherwise. But for someone who does not 
want to wear glasses for sports or occupational purposes, that is a fair 
trade-off, McDonnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell added that the procedure has changed considerably since the 
surgeries in the study were performed. People get fewer incisions, the 
incisions tend to be shorter and the knives are thinner, so there is less 
trauma. "In some reports, 95% to 100% of the subjects have 20/40 vision or 
better. In the short term, that is a real improvement. The question is what 
will happen in another 10 years." Seeing Better 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-year study of radial keratotomy -- a controversial surgical technique -- 
has shown that the procedure is safe. More than 70% of subjects still did not 
need glasses for distance vision. Only 3% had poorer distance vision with 
glasses a decade after surgery and none had catastrophic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 1) Nearsightedness occurs when the cornea is too thick. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Surgeons make four to 16 radial incisions in the cornea that allow it to 
relax and become thinner, so that it focuses light correctly.

EPA ACCORD COULD BAN UP TO 85 PESTICIDES; AGRICULTURE: AFFECTED INDUSTRIES WILL 
URGE A FEDERAL JUDGE TO REJECT THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT. SUBSTANCES ON THE LIST 
CAUSE CANCER IN LABORATORY ANIMALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ending a five-year legal dispute with California environmentalists and farm 
workers, the Clinton Administration signed an agreement Wednesday that could 
ban up to 85 popular pesticides because of their potential to cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed settlement -- if approved by a U.S. District Court in Sacramento 
-- means the federal Environmental Protection Agency must make long-awaited 
decisions on what pesticides can be used in raw and processed foods. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the state of California, environmentalists and the AFL-CIO sued the 
EPA to uphold a controversial food-safety provision called the Delaney clause, 
which prohibits any trace of cancer-causing additives in processed foods, such 
as juices and canned vegetables and fruits. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the EPA allowed what it calls "negligible risk" from small amounts 
of pesticides, but under the proposed settlement, the agency now agrees to 
enforce the "zero risk" in the Delaney clause. That essentially means the 
federal agency would prohibit use of 36 popular insecticides, herbicides and 
fungicides on most crops within two years and review an additional 49 within 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing pesticide litigation since 1969, and this is the most 
important pesticide case that has ever been brought, simply because it involves 
such a large number of chemicals. It addresses all these pesticides in one fell 
swoop," said Ralph Abascal, general counsel for California Rural Legal 
Assistance, one of the five parties that sued the EPA. "This is the first time 
such a comprehensive, cross-cutting policy has been challenged and resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Pesticide industry and food processing representatives said Wednesday they 
will try to persuade the federal judge to reject the proposed settlement, which 
will be submitted to the court Dec. 2. They also vowed to beef up efforts to 
persuade Congress to revoke the law, contending that it is unreasonable and 
unrealistic to enforce zero tolerance of pesticide residue in food. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no need to panic right now with regard to agriculture producers and 
the availability of these tools. This isn't going to happen tomorrow," said 
John McCarthy, a vice president of the American Crop Protection Assn., which 
represents pesticide manufacturers. "This settlement hasn't been accepted by 
the court, and chances are we will get a new law that will fix this before the 
sky falls." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Abascal said "it is a very steep hill" for the pesticide industry to 
persuade the judge to throw out a settlement reached among so many parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Curtis of the Natural Resources Defense Council, another of the 
plaintiffs, called the proposed settlement "great news for consumers, farmers 
and the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 The 85 pesticides, many of them widely dispersed, cause cancer in laboratory 
animals -- although in some cases only after they are fed large volumes. 
Biologists also believe some of the pesticides mimic or block hormones and can 
trigger reproductive defects such as low fertility in wildlife and perhaps 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA Administrator Carol Browner said the agreement "assures that America will 
continue to enjoy the cheapest, most abundant and safest food supply in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Browner added, however, that the settlement "addresses only one complex part 
of the nation's system for safe pesticide management. The Administration 
believes the entire food safety program requires overhaul." 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials say the agreement, if approved, is likely to lead to bans on 
many uses of the pesticides, including alachlor, one of the nation's most 
widely used herbicides; dicofol, an insecticide spread on citrus, grapes, 
apples and other fruits; atrazine, an herbicide used on sugar cane and corn, 
and lindane, used on tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, many of the chemicals are used by growers to kill pests and 
weeds. Under the proposed settlement, however, they would have time to search 
for new biological controls or chemical replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because there are so many 'ifs' involved, it is hard to know what the impact 
will be on growers," said Dave Kranz, a California Farm Bureau spokesman. "Even 
if the settlement is accepted, the chemicals would be removed from the market 
during a period that could last as long as two years, and that would give 
growers some time to adjust or find alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 The first 36 pesticides will probably be phased out because the EPA already 
has determined that they cause cancer in animals and that they concentrate in 
processed foods. The 49 others have been linked to cancer but the agency must 
conduct further research to determine if they leave residue in foods. 
</P>
<P>
 The Delaney food-safety clause, enacted in 1958, is one of the strictest 
environmental laws on the books, and Congress for years has debated its future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of its impact and its scope, this settlement could be the catalyst 
that breaks the logjam in Congress," Abascal said, "and forces us and the 
industry and the government into a major change for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials and many toxicologists contend that the small amounts of 
pesticides most people consume are not hazardous, so the chemicals should not 
be banned. But environmentalists argue that scientists do not understand the 
cumulative effects, or what amounts might trigger cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing certain about all of this is that something needs to be done 
with the Delaney clause," Kranz said. "With our ability to detect pesticides 
down to parts per trillion, a zero standard becomes almost impossible to 
enforce."

THE TIMES POLL / CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; UNDECIDED VOTERS KEY TO MANY RACES; MOST 
LOWER-PROFILE STATE CONTESTS ARE TOO CLOSE TO CALL, SURVEY FINDS. BIGGEST LEADS 
ARE IN MATCHUPS FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Voters have yet to make up their minds in four low-profile statewide races on 
the Nov. 8 election ballot but hold more sharply defined opinions in matchups 
involving better-known hopefuls for lieutenant governor and attorney general, a 
Los Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, the only statewide Republican officeholder other than 
Gov. Pete Wilson, holds a 45% to 30% edge among likely voters over his 
Democratic challenger, Assemblyman Tom Umberg of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, in the competition for lieutenant governor, another big-name 
politician, Democrat Gray Davis, maintains a 49% to 25% margin over his 
Republican rival, state Sen. Cathie Wright of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 With voters giving a slight advantage to Republicans when asked which party 
can best handle government, statewide GOP candidates, excluding Wright, appear 
to have a real opportunity to break the two-decade grip Democrats have held on 
most of these statewide offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueling Republican chances in November, for the first time in years, five of 
the six races are wide open without incumbents battling for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, with attention focused on the spirited battles for governor and U.S. 
Senate, the down-ballot races have generated scant attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition for these offices is expected to heat up as the major party 
candidates launch TV and radio advertising blitzes late in the campaign to bash 
their opponents and enhance their own standing with voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The statewide survey questioned 1,232 registered voters, including 821 likely 
voters. The margin of sampling error is 3 percentage points in either direction 
for registered voters. For likely voters, the margin of error is plus or minus 
4 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Although voters are said to be in a "throw out the bums" mood, Lungren and 
Davis, currently state controller, seem to be escaping full-scale voter 
resentment toward incumbents. Still, in the races for attorney general and 
lieutenant governor, 25% of likely voters have yet to make up their minds. 
Their decisions could swing the outcome one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of undecided voters markedly widens in other contests featuring 
less well-known figures. For example, in a matchup for secretary of state, 
12-year Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno) registers 31% to 26% over Democrat 
Tony Miller, the acting secretary of state, with 42% of the likely voters not 
having made up their minds. Miller and Jones are vying to succeed longtime 
Secretary of State March Fong Eu. 
</P>
<P>
 Some campaign consultants suggest that Miller's ballot designation as acting 
secretary of state will give his campaign a boost. John Brennan, director of 
The Times Poll, agreed that a favorably received occupation label on the ballot 
can shift results one way or another. Those questioned in the Times poll, when 
asked about a candidate, were not told his or her occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan said many voters will not be making up their minds until Election Day 
and their decisions will be influenced by a variety of factors, including TV 
ads not yet aired. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan cited Phil Angelides of Sacramento, the Democratic candidate for state 
treasurer, who two weeks before the June primary was trailing his rival, state 
Sen. David A. Roberti of Van Nuys, by 14 percentage points. After airing strong 
TV attack ads, however, Angelides coasted to his party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 In the general election campaign, Angelides again trails, this time to 
Republican Matthew K. Fong, a member of the state Board of Equalization from 
Hacienda Heights. The poll shows Fong ahead of Angelides, 39% to 29%, with 
those who haven't made up their minds at 32%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Angelides has squirreled away $2.5 million in campaign funds for another 
last-minute advertising campaign for the treasurer's job, currently occupied by 
Kathleen Brown. But whether the salvo makes a dent in Fong's lead is unclear 
because Fong has managed to consolidate his Republican base, winning favor with 
71% of all GOP voters while Angelides has support of only 54% of all Democrats, 
according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The election to succeed Democrat John Garamendi as state insurance 
commissioner appears to be a tossup. State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) and 
Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush (R-Cupertino) are in a virtual tie, 36% to 
34%, with 29% of likely voters not having made up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running close for controller were Democratic newcomer Kathleen Connell 
and strong conservative Republican Tom McClintock, a former Republican 
assemblyman from Thousand Oaks. Connell was two points ahead, with 35% 
undecided. They are battling to succeed two-term Controller Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Among likely voters, 60% have yet to make up their minds on who should succeed 
former Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig in that nonpartisan race. The 
poll found no clear front-runner, with the two finalists, Assemblywoman Delaine 
Eastin (D-Fremont) and Maureeen DiMarco, a Democrat who serves as the 
governor's education adviser, both polling 20%.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; 3 FIREFIGHTER ORGANIZATIONS ENDORSE WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson helped kick off California Fire Prevention Week at the 
Burbank Fire Training Center on Wednesday, thanking firefighters for their hard 
work and pledging to crack down on "sick thugs" with new anti-arson laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, stepping out of the training center and onto the lawn, Wilson the 
governor became Wilson the candidate. At a second media event -- attended by 
sign-waving supporters of state Treasurer Kathleen Brown -- Wilson accepted 
endorsements from three firefighting organizations representing about 28,000 
management, rank-and-file and rescue personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have we been through hard times? Did the state of California lose a third of 
its revenues, just like a family losing overnight a third of its income? We 
did," Wilson said. "But what we have done is make sure that the priority is 
education at the state level, public safety at the local level." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a placard carried by a firefighter who supports Brown -- "Where 
Was Your Support Before Firestorm '93?" -- Wilson said, "Proposition 172 was 
before firestorm '93. . . . My support didn't come lately. (Firefighters) have 
had it for a very long time and they've had it in a material way." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 172, passed in the 1992 election, allowed counties to collect a 
half-cent sales tax for local law enforcement and firefighting programs. The 
idea was to compensate counties for some of the property tax money that Wilson 
had reallocated to pay for state school funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's words were immediately challenged by the pro-Brown firefighters, who 
called Wilson a fair-weather friend. According to this group, the three 
organizations that endorsed Wilson -- the California State Firefighters Assn., 
the Fire Districts Assn. of California and the California Fire Chiefs Assn. -- 
represented mainly the interests of management, not the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not fire chiefs. We're regular people who do the work," said John 
Tennant, vice president of the California Professional Firefighters, a 
20,000-member group that has endorsed Brown. "Gov. Wilson is no friend of 
firefighters. . . . We (have) had to fight to keep him from decimating the fire 
service. He's not always been successful. But it's not because of his goodwill 
for the people like us who do the work." 
</P>
<P>
 Lew Stone, president of the Burbank Fire Fighters Local 778, noted that "if 
you're a college student, you can join" the pro-Wilson California State 
Firefighters Assn. "So can anybody who wants to become a firefighter someday, 
(or) who just likes the fire service. So when they stand up here and say, 'We 
represent the firefighters,' that is false." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Giacomo, a California State Firefighters spokesman, confirmed that 
students and other non-firefighters can join the 28,000-member group, but said 
the associate members number only about 500. Thirty-five percent of the 
membership is made up of volunteer and retired firefighters, he said. He could 
not provide a breakdown of management and rank-and-file members.

POLL FINDS BIG EDGE FOR GOP IN FALL ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in decades, a substantial majority of registered voters say 
they are inclined to vote for a Republican for Congress in the fall elections, 
according to a Times Mirror survey -- an inclination that, if it persists for 
the next four weeks, would lead to large GOP gains. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, conducted by the Times Mirror Center for the People & the Press, 
found 52% of registered voters saying that they intend to vote Republican while 
only 40% said they would vote for a Democratic candidate. Last month, the 
survey found the Republicans leading by only a 2-percentage-point margin, 48% 
to 46%. The current 12-point margin is the largest for the GOP since the spring 
of 1954, when a Gallup poll found the GOP leading the Democrats, 53% to 47%. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1954 lead eventually faded, and Democrats actually won a substantial 
majority of the overall vote cast that year. With Congress out of session and 
Democratic incumbents back home campaigning, party strategists hope that 
history will repeat itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls of party inclination are often a good barometer of the total number of 
seats likely to change hands in an election. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving the Democratic numbers down is President Clinton's continued 
unpopularity. Those polled disapprove of his performance in office by a 38%-47% 
margin with 15% uncertain. That uncertainty level is about as close to good 
news for Democrats as the poll contains. A month ago, the poll showed 
disapproval by 41% to 52% with 7% unsure, indicating that some Americans who 
had turned against Clinton may be re-evaluating but are not yet prepared to 
endorse his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans lead among both men and women, although their margin is 
considerably larger, 57% to 38%, among male voters than among women, 48% to 
42%. Blacks continue to favor the Democrats, 71% to 10%, and Latinos do so by 
55% to 38%. But white voters have turned to the Republicans, 56% to 38%, the 
poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 On another subject, the poll found Americans rapidly tiring of coverage of the 
O.J. Simpson murder trial. In June, after Simpson's arrest, 48% of those polled 
said they were following the case "very closely." In September, that number had 
dropped to 30%. It has now dropped again, to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Mirror Survey was conducted among 1,513 adults, including 560 
registered voters, between Oct. 6 and Oct. 9. Results for the entire survey 
have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, while 
results for the sample of registered voters have a margin of sampling error of 
plus or minus five points.

DEMOCRATS HOPE TO SCARE UP SOME VOTES; POLITICS: CAMPAIGN ADS FOCUS ON WHAT TO 
FEAR ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS. TACTIC DERIDES GOP'S 'CONTRACT' AS IT TRIES TO GET 
VOTERS TO THE POLLS.

<P>
 Democrats who once assured Americans that they had nothing to fear but fear 
itself now are striving to scare them into going to the polls in hopes of 
staving off a potential disaster in next month's midterm election. 
</P>
<P>
 The party's latest effort to shake off the apathy that seems to prevail among 
their traditional supporters was unveiled here Wednesday -- a $2-million 
multi-state television advertising campaign, echoing themes sounded earlier in 
the week by President Clinton and warning that votes for Republicans could mean 
a return to the economic hard times that ended the George Bush presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The salvo seems aimed particularly at union members who still make up a key 
part of the Democratic coalition, though many drifted to the GOP during the 
Ronald Reagan presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Democrats and their interest group allies around the country are 
spreading other alarms: warning women that a GOP victory could mean restriction 
of abortion rights, warning senior citizens about threats to Social Security 
and Medicare, and warning all their allies about dangers from the "radical" 
Christian right. 
</P>
<P>
 Scaring voters is "about all the Democrats can do," said University of Texas 
political scientist Walter Dean Burnham, a specialist in voter turnout. "They 
don't have any other assets." 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty posed by low turnout in an off-year election is not new for 
Democrats, who tend to draw much of their strongest support from the lower end 
of the socioeconomic scale. Such voters are less likely to go to the polls, 
particularly in a non-presidential campaign, than more affluent, better 
educated citizens who are more inclined to favor Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem has been heightened in this campaign, professionals in both 
parties said, by Clinton's efforts to depict himself as "a different kind of 
Democrat." Appealing more to middle-class centrist voters has not offered the 
liberal constituencies that make up the Democratic Party's core much reason to 
go out and vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The North American Free Trade Agreement) and welfare reform don't do much 
for the Democratic base," said Democratic political consultant Joe Trippi. The 
trade pact was one of Clinton's biggest legislative accomplishments, while 
welfare reform, along with another effort at health care reform, tops his 
domestic agenda for next year. While Clinton claims credit for helping to 
revive the economy and cut unemployment, analysts said that lower-middle-income 
workers and their families have yet to feel much benefit from the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Among blacks, considered the most reliable of Democratic voters, "there has 
been the perception that Clinton had lots of nice words but no action," said 
Curtis Gans, head of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a 
nonpartisan group that analyzes voting trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Gans suggested that Clinton's decision to send troops to Haiti might boost his 
stock in the black community, but other analysts said they doubt that the 
plight of blacks in Haiti matters enough to blacks here to spur their turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the overall mood of voter alienation, reflected in the low turnout 
in this year's state primaries, most analysts predict that turnout in November 
will be low for both parties, comparable to 1990 when it barely climbed above 
36% of the voting-age population. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts in both parties said that Democrats are likely to suffer most. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are dissatisfied with the President are very energized and 
intense," said Bill McInturff, whose polling firm is used by about 60 GOP House 
and Senate candidates. "The people who do support the President are very 
squishy and reluctant to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 "What appears to be happening is that the Democratic base is not coming out 
and the Republican base, basically people who are fed up with Washington . . . 
see this year as a vehicle to express their displeasure," said Saul Shorr, a 
Democratic consultant for 22 candidates around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of these unfavorable national trends, most Democratic strategists 
have advised their candidates to focus their campaigns on local issues, 
emphasizing their own individual strengths while taking potshots at their GOP 
foes. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Republican candidates around the country committed themselves en 
masse to a "contract with America," a 10-point Reaganesque plan for cutting 
taxes, trimming social programs and beefing up the military, Democrats and 
their partisans seized on the manifesto as a target for a sustained offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Council of Senior Citizens, representing about 4 million retired 
union workers, branded the Republican contract an "economic suicide pact drawn 
up by those all too willing to turn away from old 'covenant' programs, such as 
Social Security and Medicare." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Malcolm, president of EMILY's List, a political action committee that 
supports Democratic women candidates who favor the right to abortion, contended 
that the contract showed Republican success in the fall "will create a 
leadership that either ignores or votes against the needs of women and 
families." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Democratic advertising campaign also targets the Republican contract, 
relying on the imagery of television commercials. One of the four commercials 
that will start airing later this week chides Republicans for blocking Clinton 
legislative initiatives, such as the anti-crime bill and his economic program. 
But the other three ads zero in on the GOP's own goals, as expressed in the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans are shown signing the contract while a narrator warns that what 
the GOP has in mind are "huge tax cuts for the wealthy . . . gigantic new 
job-killing deficits . . . deep cuts in Medicare, education and veterans' 
benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic National Chairman David Wilhelm said that the ads would run in 
about 10 states.

U.S. PLANS TO OFFER CUBANS A VISA LOTTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration announced plans Wednesday to distribute 5,000 to 
6,000 immigration visas to Cubans by a lottery, giving a chance at resettlement 
to Cubans who thus far have been excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, visas have been largely restricted to Cubans who qualify for 
refugee status or those with close relatives in the United States who are 
American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department announcement said Cubans selected through the lottery 
will be allowed to bring their spouses and minor children with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement provided details on an agreement signed by the United States 
and Cuba on Sept. 9. Under that agreement, Cuba agreed to curb the exodus from 
the island by boat while the United States promised to grant a minimum of 
20,000 visas annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 
said the lottery will be limited to Cubans who would be self-sufficient on 
arrival in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement also said "significant efforts" are under way to upgrade the 
facilities and improve the quality of life for Cubans being given shelter at 
the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo and at U.S. military facilities in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 32,000 Cubans having been living at the two sites since this past 
summer. None is eligible for resettlement in the United States without 
returning to Cuba proper and applying for a visa through normal channels.

AMERICAN ALBUM: A GAME OF KING OF THE HILL AT DEVILS MONUMENT; PLAINS INDIANS 
SAY THE MOUNTAIN IS HOLY GROUND. BUT TO ROCK CLIMBERS, IT'S A PLAYGROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN ROVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 For centuries, Plains Indians have made pilgrimages to the 860-foot-high 
volcanic monolith rising over this northeast corner of Wyoming to seek 
religious visions and leave prayer bundles of tobacco and sage. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, the massive stone pillar known as Devils Tower has become 
better known for the challenge it provides for up to 6,000 climbers a year from 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Native Americans who revere the rock as a religious shrine are at odds 
with climbers who get another kind of high by scaling what in 1906 became the 
first national monument in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Native Americans are petitioning the federal government to ban the climbers, 
who they say desecrate a holy site by riveting its face with bolts -- even 
urinating on its walls. They also complain that increased climbing and tourism 
make it impossible to hear the Great Spirit who, tradition says, created the 
Sioux here. 
</P>
<P>
 "All hell would break lose if I went to climbing the Washington Monument or 
the National Cathedral," argued Francis Brown, an Arapaho and president of the 
Medicine Wheel Coalition for Sacred Sites of North America, which wants to 
protect Devils Tower and dozens of other sacred locations. "Our plan is to shut 
the climbing down, slowly if that is what it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 No way, said Andy Petefish, who runs a climbing service near the tower and 
strongly objects to what he claims is an attempt to destroy a federal mandate 
that provides for multiple uses of the monument, including recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, prayer bundles are a bunch of trash, and I'm very 
offended to have them hanging around the monument," Petefish said. "They 
(monument officials) should be managing climbing based on quantifiable, 
scientific research on its impact on the tower, not on one group's religious 
beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he added, "the Indians get to build fires in the most beautiful 
meadow in the park for their sweat lodge and Sun Dance ceremonies, but they 
don't climb that rock, which I own as an American citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the tower's climbers are that intransigent on the issue. 
Nonetheless, the dispute is especially thorny for National Park Service 
officials trying to forge a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little doubt, however, about which side the Park Service has favored 
in past years. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibits at the monument's visitors center -- housed in a log cabin built in 
the 1930s -- emphasize climbing history over Native American tradition. During 
summer months, park rangers don climbing gear several times a day to 
demonstrate "handholds and foot jams" on a replica of part of a tower wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Park Service has done a poor job of including the Native American 
cultural perspective," conceded George San Miguel, chief of resource management 
at the monument. 
</P>
<P>
 "History," he said, "did not begin here in 1875." 
</P>
<P>
 That year, Chief Red Cloud and other Sioux chiefs met with federal officials 
in Washington to discuss the transfer of mineral rights in the Black Hills, the 
northwest corner of which is anchored by Devils Tower -- at that time part of 
the Great Sioux Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, miners and surveyors with a government-sponsored expedition 
were scouting for gold and dubbed the imposing natural citadel Devils Tower, a 
name Native Americans still consider offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few years, the government removed the gold-bearing Black Hills from 
the reservation, paving the way for white settlers who developed ranches near 
the tower. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1893, two of those early ranchers pounded large stakes into one of 
thousands of cracks in the tower -- composed of vertical four-, six- and 
eight-sided gray stone columns up to eight feet in diameter -- and made the 
first ascent to the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, 65,000 climbers have had a go at the tower. Their legacy: nearly 
600 bolts pounded into its walls. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the growing popularity of climbing here and elsewhere on federal 
lands, government officials in 1991 began reviewing the impact of the sport on 
natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 National Park officials created a task force of climbers, Native Americans and 
local officials to come up with a management policy amenable to all sides. 
Their plan calls for a voluntary climbing ban each June, when important Plains 
Indian ceremonies are performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Monument officials hope to have the plan finalized by January and implemented 
this spring. But the dispute may be far from over. If the voluntary closure 
fails, the Park Service has already threatened to impose a mandatory June 
climbing ban. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, climber groups would be almost certain to take their argument 
to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately for us," said Jerry Flute of the nonprofit Assn. of American 
Indian Affairs, "our sacred sites are in very beautiful places where federal 
land managers are promoting their tourism value, including climbing."

BUILDUP IN THE PERSIAN GULF; U.S., BRITAIN, GULF STATES RENEW VOWS; ALLIANCE: 
KUWAIT'S ARAB NEIGHBORS SAY THEY WILL HELP DEFRAY COST OF MILITARY BUILDUP. 
THEY ALSO PLEDGE TO DETER ANY FUTURE IRAQI AGGRESSION. 
</P>

 Asserting that the latest Gulf crisis is not over despite an apparent Iraqi 
retreat, the United States, Britain and six oil-rich monarchies agreed 
Wednesday to continue their present military buildup and vowed future action to 
sap Saddam Hussein's capacity to threaten his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gulf Cooperation Council, a regional rich nations club led by Saudi 
Arabia, agreed to pay a substantial part of the cost of deploying U.S., British 
and other allied troops to defend Kuwait against any Iraqi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters here following a strategy 
session with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and the six Gulf council 
foreign ministers that the allies agreed unanimously to devise ways to prevent 
the Iraqi dictator from taking sudden provocative actions such as sending 
troops south to the Kuwaiti border as Hussein did last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are resolved and committed that Hussein shall not be permitted to project 
the world into crisis at his whim," Christopher told a news conference, with 
Hurd and Prince Saud al Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said no specific measures have been selected. Other officials have 
suggested creation of a buffer zone on the Iraqi side of the border, from which 
Iraqi tanks, artillery and other heavy weapons would be excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 France and Russia -- which both have trade ties with Iraq -- have balked at 
such a zone, with French officials asserting that Iraq's internal military 
movements were not illegal and a Russian delegation arriving in Baghdad to 
discuss ways of defusing the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official traveling with Christopher said a "no-tank" zone would 
seem to fulfill the objective of the United States, Britain and the Gulf 
states. But he said there are other ways of reaching that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Another official said the measures must be tough enough to have an impact but 
cannot be so strict that governments such as France and Russia would refuse to 
go along. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gulf Cooperation Council -- whose members are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United 
Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain -- said in a formal communique that the 
allied military buildup "should continue until they are sure that Iraq no 
longer poses a threat." 
</P>
<P>
 The council said Iraq's decision to withdraw some of its troops in the face of 
the allied countermeasures did not erase the latest demonstration of Hussein's 
willingness to use force. Christopher said flatly, "The crisis is not over," 
despite Iraqi withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior State Department official said before Iraq's latest military maneuver 
that many Gulf council officials had begun to lose their Gulf War distrust of 
Hussein and his policies. Now, he said, the distrust "has been restored 
completely." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher obtained the endorsement of U.S. policy from the council just one 
day after King Hussein of Jordan expressed "deep sadness, disappointment and 
anger" at the recent Iraqi action. The king, who had shown sympathy for Iraq 
four years ago, issued his strongest condemnation of the latest Iraqi adventure 
at a joint news conference with the secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Gulf council meeting, Christopher visited Camp Doha, a military base 
40 miles south of the Iraqi border, to meet some of the 1,400 soldiers of the 
24th Mechanized Infantry Division who have arrived from Ft. Stewart, Ga., in 
the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said the Gulf council agreed to "equitably share the cost of our 
efforts" and to create a special fund to finance the military action. He said 
there are no firm estimates as yet of the cost of the operation, so it is 
impossible to determine how much each of the six Gulf states will contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Another senior official said later that the Gulf states probably will put up 
most of the money, as they did in 1990 and 1991, when a U.S.-led coalition 
forced Iraq out of Kuwait. But the official said Saudi Arabia paid a 
disproportionately large share of the 1990-91 costs and is anxious for its 
partners to shoulder more of the burden this time. Kuwait agreed to provide 
more of the cash this time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the six Gulf countries agreed to allow allied warplanes to fly 
over and land in each of the countries. 
</P>
<P>
 They also ordered military units of the council-controlled Peninsula Shield 
Force to join in the defense of Kuwait.

BUILDUP IN THE PERSIAN GULF; PENTAGON TAKES STEPS TO PREVENT MYSTERIOUS GULF 
WAR ILLNESS; HEALTH: RECORDS WILL BE KEPT OF HAZARDOUS EXPOSURE. VACCINE 
REQUIREMENTS OF '91 OPERATION WILL BE DROPPED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Pentagon, hoping to prevent a repeat of the mysterious spate of illnesses 
in those who served in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, will require medical 
personnel deployed to Kuwait in the current operation to keep careful records 
of troop exposure to possible environmental hazards and drug treatments, 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time we will try to get this information as we go instead of after the 
fact," said Col. Doug Hart, a spokesman for the Defense Department. "We will be 
putting more emphasis on the recording of things than was done before. We'll 
have more information than we had last time." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Pentagon will not require soldiers to take certain preventive drugs 
and vaccines that were given in the earlier deployment and were blamed by many 
for medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 20,000 of the nearly 700,000 troops who served in the Gulf four 
years ago have reported numerous ailments, including fatigue, skin rashes, 
muscle and joint pain, headaches, memory loss, shortness of breath and 
gastrointestinal problems, as well as birth defects in their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 Their complaints have prompted a series of investigations that thus far have 
yielded no definitive conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical personnel's primary assignment will be to provide care for the 
troops, a function no different from that in any other military operation, Hart 
said. However, they also will be asked to register all treatments and 
environmental exposures and any other additional information that could prove 
useful should additional illnesses develop, or as part of the ongoing 
investigation of the still-unsolved syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical teams in the Persian Gulf "will be able to provide information and 
investigate industrial pollutants, stress, infectious diseases and possible 
biological and chemical warfare," Hart added. "It will make a difference, 
having these people there, recording all this stuff immediately. That's the one 
thing we did learn from previous experience -- it is taking us a lot longer 
because we're doing it after the fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked earlier in the week about Persian Gulf War Syndrome, Gen. John M. 
Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that "no 
one is more concerned and frustrated about our inability to get at the root of 
that problem than the Defense Department." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I don't have an easy answer for anyone, because we don't know what 
really happened, other than that we are going to watch this very, very 
carefully for any signs of possible repetition." 
</P>
<P>
 No single substance or organism has been identified as the cause of the health 
problems suffered by veterans of Operation Desert Storm. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the troops were exposed to a variety of potentially toxic 
chemicals, as in fumes and smoke from oil-well fires, diesel fumes, toxic 
paints, pesticides and depleted uranium used in munitions and armor. 
</P>
<P>
 They were also given at least three drugs under special circumstances in which 
the military and the Food and Drug Administration waived the usual 
informed-consent procedures because of expected battlefield conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The drugs included pyridostigmine bromide, a drug to protect against chemical 
warfare, which is licensed only for the treatment of myasthenia gravis, a 
chronic muscle weakness disorder; an as-yet-unapproved vaccine to combat 
botulism, and a licensed vaccine to protect against anthrax. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the three is being administered to soldiers serving in the current 
deployment, Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Desert Storm soldiers were instructed to take a series of pyridostigmine 
bromide tablets to ward off the potential effects of chemical warfare. But the 
drug has side effects, among them serious gastrointestinal symptoms. Many 
soldiers reported uncontrolled vomiting after taking the drug, in addition to 
bouts of pain and other disabling ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart denied that Gulf War Syndrome was the reason Defense Department officials 
decided against requiring the drug this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's available but not required. If the threat is strong enough, it will be 
distributed," he said. "At this point, we don't think the threat is the same." 
</P>
<P>
 The anthrax and botulism vaccines have not been administered this time either, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the troops have received routine mandatory inoculations known to be 
safe, Hart said, including vaccines to protect against hepatitis, influenza, 
measles, polio and tetanus. Gulf War Syndrome 
</P>
<P>
 Facts about the illness that has stricken Gulf veterans: 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: Gulf War Syndrome is a mysterious collection of illnesses 
affecting at least 200,000 men and women who served in Desert Storm. Some 
spouses have also complained of ill effects. 
</P>
<P>
 * Symptoms: Debilitating fatigue, skin rash, headaches, muscle or joint pain, 
chest pain, shortness of breath, memory loss, sleep disturbances and diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cause: Its existence has been validated by the National Institutes of 
Health, but no specific cause has been diagnosed. Theories include stress, 
parasites and reactions to pills or inoculations designed to counter the 
effects of chemical warfare. Other suspected causes include exposure to 
chemical toxins, ammunition made from depleted uranium, poor sanitation, 
oil-well fires, burning landfills or a combination of these factors.

S. AFRICA TRIAL IN KILLING OF U.S. STUDENT ENDS; LAW: JUDGE'S VERDICT DUE LATER 
THIS MONTH IN MURDER OF AMY BIEHL OF NEWPORT BEACH. THREE MEN FACE LIFE IN 
PRISON IF CONVICTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After 11 weary months in court, prosecutors and defense lawyers completed 
closing arguments Wednesday in the trial of three youths accused of murdering 
California exchange student Amy Biehl last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Friedman, a provincial Supreme Court judge, said he will deliver his 
verdict Oct. 24. South Africa does not have jury trials. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of the gruesome, apparently racially motivated killing, the three 
men could face life imprisonment. The death penalty is still on the books, but 
the new government has halted executions. 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl, a 26-year-old scholar and athlete from Newport Beach, was completing 
her tour as a Fulbright scholar when she was beaten and stabbed to death Aug. 
25, 1993, by an anti-white mob in Guguletu, a black township outside Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
 She is believed to be the only American killed during fierce political 
violence in the run-up to April's multiracial elections. She was working on 
women's issues and voter education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 All three defendants are members of PASO, the militant youth wing of the 
radical black nationalist Pan Africanist Congress. Testimony indicated they 
were coming from a PASO meeting and were among a mob stoning vehicles and 
chanting "Kill the settler!" -- a derogatory term used for whites -- when Biehl 
was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth defendant, who fled last year after being released as a juvenile, is 
now in custody awaiting trial. Prosecutors withdrew charges against two other 
suspects after a key witness said he was too frightened to testify, but 
prosecutors said the pair may be rearrested after the verdict. A seventh 
suspect has been killed in township violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the trial was devoted to a lengthy hearing of defense claims that 
police had beaten confessions from the three defendants. The "trial within a 
trial" heard 27 witnesses, while only seven witnesses testified during the rest 
of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the judge ruled that incriminating statements by Mzikhona 
Nofemela, 21, and Vusumzi Ntamo, 21, would be admitted as evidence. He 
disallowed a confession by Mongezi Manquina, 22, the only member of the group 
to take the stand in his own defense. In contrast to the United States, here a 
defendant's refusal to testify may be held against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Nollie Niehaus argued that the confessions, and testimony given by 
three surprise eyewitnesses -- who appeared at the end of the trial and whose 
names were withheld after they complained of death threats -- "abundantly" 
proved his case. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense lawyer Justice Poswa insisted the witness accounts were 
"inconsistent," "improbable" and "actual lies." He offered no alibi for the 
defendants, however, and called no witness other than Manquina. He complained 
repeatedly that he was "rushed" into preparing for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecution witnesses said Biehl was driving three black friends home from her 
farewell party when her Mazda was pelted with stones and forced to stop. 
Bleeding from the face, she stumbled from the car and was chased to a nearby 
gas station where she was robbed, beaten and stabbed. She later died on the 
floor of a police station. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner testified that Biehl was stabbed above the right eye, had her skull 
fractured and was stabbed in the heart. Witnesses said both Manquina and 
Nofemela chased Biehl from the car with knives and repeatedly stabbed and 
kicked her. 
</P>
<P>
 Ntamo admitted in his confession that he threw bricks at Biehl as she lay 
bleeding on the ground and "hit her three times on the head." He also said 
Manquina had boasted "he was proud to have killed a white person." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial initially drew a packed gallery of the defendants' supporters, some 
of whom chanted anti-white slogans and taunted Biehl's family members when they 
visited. 
</P>
<P>
 But only a handful of spectators showed up for the summation. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial has dramatically highlighted the challenges the post-apartheid 
government faces trying to reform a judicial and law enforcement system in 
which police investigations still are often limited to obtaining confessions, 
frequently by force, from suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, investigators recovered no clothing, fingerprints, weapons or 
any other evidence from the crime scene.

MEXICO SUSPECT LINKS POLITICIANS TO PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Federal deputies and at least one senator plotted the Sept. 28 assassination 
of the second-ranking official in Mexico's ruling party and planned to kill a 
former party chairman and other politicians, an accused conspirator told 
police, according to a statement released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez, an aide to congressman Manuel Munoz Rocha, told 
police that his boss belonged to two political groups whose purpose was to 
"rescue the leadership of the country for those who had been displaced, without 
regard to what means had to be used to achieve that," according to a statement 
from the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The means of eliminating such political reformers included murder, he told 
police. The hit list included Fernando Ortiz Arana, former chairman of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has governed Mexico for 65 years; Gov. 
Manuel Cavazos Lerma of the state of Tamaulipas, and Congresswoman Laura Alicia 
Garza Galindo, head of the Tamaulipas legislative delegation, as well as the 
slain man, Francisco Ruiz Massieu. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement said Rodriguez Gonzalez told police that one of the dissident 
political groups consisted of deputies and the other was led by Sen. Enrique 
Cardenas Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas Gonzalez complained to the attorney general's office last week that 
he was being slandered when other suspects accused him of involvement in the 
alleged assassination plot. Munoz Rocha is a fugitive and has reportedly been 
sighted in both Brownsville, Tex., and the central Mexican state of Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez Gonzalez was arrested late Monday in the northwestern state of 
Zacatecas after a dozen other suspects -- most of them his relatives -- were 
already in custody. His statement corroborated their testimony, according to 
the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez Gonzalez said Munoz Rocha told him in December that he had received 
an order from one of the political groups to kill ruling party official 
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, according to the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez Gonzalez hired his brother, Marco Antonio, to organize the murder 
plot, giving him more than $300,000 to do the job. The money, he told police, 
came from Abraham Rubio Canales, a jailed politician who had served in Ruiz 
Massieu's gubernatorial administration in the southern state of Guerrero. Other 
suspects said Rubio Canales blamed Ruiz Massieu for not protecting him when he 
was convicted of land fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez, his brother twice hired killers -- 
paying one prospective contract killer about $150,000. Both times, they ran 
away with the money and did not attempt to commit the murder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada, on Sept. 15, Mexican Independence Day, 
Rodriguez Gonzalez said, he and Munoz Rocha made plans to carry out the 
assassination before October. Marco Antonio Rodriguez Gonzalez has not been 
implicated in the slaying sof Ruiz Massieu. 
</P>
<P>
 After the murder, Munoz Rocha offered Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez tickets to 
Paris, but the aide said he could not accept because he did not have a French 
visa. Instead, the congressman gave him $78,000 and promised him more, 
Rodriguez Gonzalez told police. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez Gonzalez also is being held on apparently unrelated smuggling and 
tax fraud charges, stemming from allegations against a warehouse company he 
ran.

FEAR LIVES ALONGSIDE HOPE IN HAITI; CARIBBEAN: END OF MILITARY RULE AND CEDRAS' 
DEPARTURE FOR PANAMA HAVEN'T STOPPED THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE. ARISTIDE CABINET 
RETURNS TO WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 American GIs pass nearby and overhead, but still Jean Brenus Lormeus is afraid 
to go home. He hides with his wife and two children in the sprawling Cite 
Soleil slum after repeated arrests and beatings by the Haitian military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, as that regime dies and just two days remain before exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide returns, Lormeus and many like him do not feel safe: The 
men with guns -- the attaches and other military henchmen -- remain on the 
loose and continue to threaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Lormeus is one of scores of people who worked in grass-roots organizations in 
support of the Aristide government, the very structure that the military 
dictatorship went about systematically destroying. 
</P>
<P>
 Their lingering fear dramatizes the volatile period of uncertainty that Haiti 
is undergoing, even as many Haitians express new hope growing with the demise 
of Haiti's murderous dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional signs of the end of de facto military rule came as Lt. Gen. Raoul 
Cedras, who was forced into retirement Monday, flew into exile. Cedras left 
Port-au-Prince airport early this morning for Panama aboard a chartered jet. He 
was joined by his wife, Yannick, and three children. Also on the plane was 
former Army Chief of Staff Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the military's puppet president, Emile Jonassaint, formally 
resigned, and members of the Aristide Cabinet reported for work for the first 
time since the bloody 1991 coup that toppled Aristide. The moves were made 
possible after U.S. troops on Tuesday seized 13 public ministries, the 
Presidential Palace and the National Bank and evicted the occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 Each step is designed to clear the way for Aristide's return Saturday, the 
product of the U.S. military occupation of this impoverished country that began 
Sept. 19. But for the men and women who did Aristide's work in the countryside 
and in the urban squalor, doubts remain that the pattern of Haitian history 
will really change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attaches are telling people that they have heard Aristide will come to 
take away their guns and uniforms, but they say before that happens they have 
plenty of time to kill all of Aristide's supporters," said Lormeus, who fled 
his home in the rural south last year after 22 days of beatings in a military 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Lormeus sought refuge in a friend's tiny home on Boston Street in Cite Soleil, 
a largely pro-Aristide shantytown in Port-au-Prince that has suffered the brunt 
of military-sponsored murder, torture and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the residents of Cite Soleil were decorating for Aristide's 
arrival. They were taking up collections to put fresh paint on the square, 
squat homes that crowd Boston Street and the other narrow roads of the slum. 
They swept away trash and hung Aristide posters, the possession of which until 
recently was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt obliged to keep (the posters), because we always had the last hope 
that he would return," said Simone Joseph, 41, an unemployed mother of seven 
who slept in her own home on Sept. 20 -- the day after U.S. troops arrived -- 
for the first time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the coup, hundreds of people were killed and many more who 
worked in the grass-roots organizations were forced underground. As people who 
organized the poor into labor, peasant and political groups, they were the 
natural enemies of a brutal military consolidating its control of a nation. 
</P>
<P>
 While many here say that the attaches and other thugs have taken a lower 
profile since the U.S. occupation, they also agree that the danger is lurking, 
especially at night. On Boston Street, neighbors have begun to keep all-night 
vigils for security. Yet in a sign of faith, they talk freely to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few months ago, said resident Danny Frantz, "you talk in the morning, 
you dead at night." 
</P>
<P>
 The major obstacle to lasting peace, they say, is the failure by U.S. troops 
to fully disarm those on the military payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. military has bought or confiscated 7,409 guns, grenades and other 
weapons since the occupation began, a spokesman for the mission said Wednesday. 
That might account for one weapon per member of the army, but it doesn't begin 
to consider the armed attaches , members of the pro-military Front for the 
Advancement and Progress of Haiti, and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aristide will not be able to protect every human life," said Maurice Jean 
Gilbert, 32, who has not seen his daughter since fleeing a raid on his home 
three years ago. "You must take the guns away from the attaches . Even the 
American soldiers are having trouble doing that, and we will suffer for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of the talk is emotional, it is not without a basis. On Sunday, 
a man driving a bus deliberately ran down a pro-Aristide march in southern 
Haiti, killing 24 people. It was the second such fatal incident in three days, 
and there are persistent reports of killings and other abuses in areas where 
U.S. troops have not been deployed. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional danger in the sense of insecurity felt by pro-Aristide groups is 
that they will take matters into their own hands if they do not believe the 
authorities are doing enough. Already, there are daily examples of "popular 
justice," when crowds target and beat an individual suspected of being an 
attache . Some are rescued but a number have been killed, and some people here 
fear violence is careening out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 With preparations in full, if chaotic, swing for Aristide's arrival, Cedras' 
departure hit a last-minute hitch Wednesday when Panama wavered on its offer of 
asylum. Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares, who has been eager to 
curry favor with Washington, offered to take Cedras in mid-September, but this 
week domestic opposition to the move forced him to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the White House and Aristide -- seconded by the Organization of American 
States -- pressed Panama to accept Cedras, Biamby and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, Berta Thayer, an adviser to Panama's foreign minister, said 
Panama would grant the asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's government was gradually returning to office Wednesday, replacing 
each symbol of military domination. Jonassaint, an 81-year-old practitioner of 
voodoo who was installed as president by the military earlier this year, 
announced his resignation in a radio broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 But his resignation was a moot point. U.S. troops blocked off the Presidential 
Palace and all state ministries Tuesday with orders to prevent members of the 
de facto regime from returning to work. 
</P>
<P>
 As they began to resume their duties, Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul and 
Prime Minister Robert Malval complained that the military regime had left the 
government in shambles, and they suggested outgoing officials will face audits. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul, who emerged from hiding three days after the occupation began, said he 
found City Hall had been mortgaged for $70,000 to pay for a Carnival party. He 
found no supplies, no furniture and records so jumbled that he cannot determine 
how many people work for the city.

YELTSIN FIRES MINISTER AFTER RUBLE'S CRASH; RUSSIA: PRESIDENT ALSO DEMANDS 
OUSTER OF CENTRAL BANK CHIEF. CRISIS HITS HOME AS PRICES RISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An angry President Boris N. Yeltsin fired his acting finance minister 
Wednesday and demanded that Parliament dump the head of the Central Bank for 
failing to prevent this week's dramatic plunge of the ruble. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bank spent another $90 million in dwindling reserves to steady the 
currency in Wednesday's trading, lawmakers delayed a vote on Yeltsin's demand 
and decided to couple it with a motion of no confidence in the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's debacle, which cost the money supply more than a quarter of its 
value in U.S. dollars, threw Russia into the worst spasm of political and 
economic uncertainty since Yeltsin eased his pioneer free-market reformers from 
the government in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is either sabotage or extreme irresponsibility and slovenliness," 
Yeltsin told his security council. "It presents a threat to the security of our 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 He named the head of the former KGB and two other officials to investigate the 
rush to dump the ruble, which fell Tuesday from 3,081 to the dollar to 3,926. 
It was the ruble's worst one-day beating since the Moscow currency market 
opened in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The blow hit home Wednesday as prices rose in kiosks and food stores, 
especially for imported goods that make up half of Russia's consumer market. 
Shoppers rushed to purchase dollars or durable goods that can be bartered 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Some merchants reset their prices on the basis of 5,000 rubles to the dollar. 
Economists predicted up to 30% monthly inflation. Yeltsin vowed to cushion 
consumers against "these flagrant miscalculations," but Economics Minister 
Alexander N. Shokhin warned against inflationary government spending. "We are 
walking on the brink of an abyss," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's draft 1995 budget, the basis for negotiations with the International 
Monetary Fund over a $6-million standby loan, was thrown into confusion three 
days before an IMF team's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Confidence in the ruble has never been strong enough to sustain it in free 
trading against the dollar. The Central Bank has intervened frequently by 
selling dollars in the market to keep the ruble somewhat overvalued but 
declining at a rate roughly equal to Russia's inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice was suspended last month to halt a drain on the bank's 
hard-currency reserves, which have dwindled to less than $5 billion. About that 
time, the bank lowered its lending rates, making currency speculation more 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Kremlin meeting Friday, Central Bank President Viktor V. Gerashchenko and 
Acting Finance Minister Sergei K. Dubinin shrugged off "alarming signals" of 
the ruble's weakness and assured Yeltsin there would be "no upheavals," 
presidential chief of staff Sergei A. Filatov told reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were totally complacent," Filatov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubinin learned of his ouster from lawmakers after testifying on the ruble's 
fall in the Duma, the lower house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duma, to which Gerashchenko is ultimately accountable, put off a decision 
on his fate until Oct. 21. It will also take up that day a motion of no 
confidence in Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin's government -- the first 
such showdown since Parliament was elected in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying in the Duma, Gerashchenko admitted "tactical miscalculations" for 
the bank's belated intervention in Tuesday's trading. But he predicted that the 
ruble, which rebounded Wednesday to 3,736 to the dollar, will keep 
strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
 To discourage currency speculation, the Central Bank on Wednesday raised its 
lending rate back to earlier levels and required commercial banks to pay 
upfront in rubles for purchases of dollars; the earlier rule let them pay 
within 48 hours.

2 CIA OFFICIALS DISCIPLINED IN SPY CASE FALLOUT; ESPIONAGE: THE AGENTS ARE 
DEMOTED BECAUSE THEY GAVE AWARD TO A COLLEAGUE WHO WAS REPRIMANDED FOR HIS ROLE 
IN THE AGENCY'S WORST INTELLIGENCE FAILURE. 
</P>

<P>
 In still more fallout from the Aldrich H. Ames spy case, two senior CIA 
officials have been demoted and will retire for giving an award to an agency 
official the day after he was severely reprimanded for his role in the Ames 
case, a senior intelligence source said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual disciplinary actions by CIA Director R. James Woolsey against the 
two officials illustrates that the Ames case, the worst counterintelligence 
failure in agency history, continues to rack the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 The two officials are John MacGaffin, the No. 2 official in the sensitive 
Directorate of Operations, which handles covert operations, and Frank Anderson, 
chief of the CIA's Near East division. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, in a move approved by MacGaffin, flew to Bonn on Sept. 29, the day 
after Woolsey announced his disciplinary decisions in the spy case, to present 
a division-level plaque to Milton Bearden, the CIA station chief in Bonn. The 
source said that the award reflected Bearden's exceptional contributions to 
issues of intelligence in the Near East. 
</P>
<P>
 MacGaffin was the highest-level official to approve the award, according to 
the intelligence source. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearden headed the CIA's Central Eurasian division in 1989, when Ames returned 
there from assignment in Rome and in the midst of his spying for the Soviet 
Union. Ames was given added responsibilities and access to information valuable 
to the Soviets after Bearden transferred him to counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Of four people Woolsey severely reprimanded for their failures in the Ames 
case, Bearden was the only one still with the agency. The severe reprimand 
would have ended his career, but he had already said that he was retiring. He 
left the agency two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior intelligence source said that he could not explain why Anderson and 
MacGaffin would reward an individual immediately after he was reprimanded for a 
case as damaging as Ames. But he contended that Woolsey did not regard their 
actions as a revolt by the Directorate of Operations against his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, their decisions "were simply errors in judgment," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woolsey saw the move as "cutting across the grain of his actions," 
according to the source. Woolsey had frozen any promotions and rewards for 
subjects of an Ames-case investigation conducted by the CIA inspector general, 
the source said.

COUPLE'S KIDNEY TRANSPLANT IMPERILED BY TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A kidney transplant operation involving two newlyweds was postponed Wednesday 
when a radiologist performing a routine test on the Mission Viejo donor nicked 
an artery in her left kidney, imperiling her ability to donate either kidney to 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sharp Memorial Hospital official said there is a chance the organ transplant 
may be canceled as a result of the injury to 45-year-old Victoria 
Ingram-Curlee, who was scheduled to donate her right kidney Wednesday to 
Randall Curlee, 46, a gravely ill diabetic whom she had married in the hospital 
chapel 24 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Mendez, renal transplantation director at Sharp Memorial, said she 
will need three to four weeks to heal before surgeons can determine whether she 
remains the almost-perfect donor for Curlee. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez said Wednesday's events produced a 25% to 35% chance that Ingram-Curlee 
will not be able to donate either kidney to Curlee, who needs the new organ 
because of his advanced diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very disappointed . . . (but) it's just a minor setback," Ingram-Curlee 
said. "I'll heal quickly and we'll proceed as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's unusual romance had captured the nation's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez said the incident occurred during an "X-ray assessment" of 
Ingram-Curlee's left kidney, which doctors needed to evaluate before they could 
remove and transplant her right one. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred during an arteriogram, a procedure designed to "assess 
the normalcy of the kidneys, the anatomy of the kidneys," Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the radiologist -- whom Mendez identified as Dr. Harold Coons -- 
began his "routine preoperative procedure" at 8 a.m. Wednesday, 6 1/2 hours 
before surgery, he discovered that blood flowed through three arteries in 
Ingram-Curlee's left kidney, rather than the usual one, Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coons inserted a narrow catheter tube into the arteries in order to inject a 
dye that would help him evaluate how well blood flowed through those vessels, 
Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the assessment of these arteries, a small accessory artery . . . was 
nicked, partially compromising the blood supply to a lower area of the kidney," 
Mendez said.

CONTACT LOST WITH VENUS SPACECRAFT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena lost radio contact 
with the Magellan spacecraft early Wednesday morning, signaling the end of a 
five-year, $900-million mission to study Venus, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lost the signal at 3:02 a.m. PDT," said Jim Doyle, a spokesman for JPL. 
</P>
<P>
 With the space probe almost worn out and running low on power, scientists 
commanded it to move into a closer orbit of Venus Tuesday for a final 
experiment testing the effects of Venus' atmosphere on the spacecraft. Magellan 
is expected to crash into Venus today about 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists used what little power the spacecraft had left to bring back to 
Earth the data on that experiment, Doyle said.

 Stanford University alumni William R. Hewlett and David Packard have given 
their alma mater its largest single donation ever: $77.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift will be used to construct four buildings for science and engineering 
studies, renovate others and create a landscaped mall, Stanford President 
Gerhard Casper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this gift will ensure that Stanford University will have 
leadership in science and engineering second to none during the 21st Century," 
Hewlett and Packard said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are co-founders of Hewlett-Packard, one of the nation's largest 
computer companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the new complex is to begin in the fall and will be completed 
by the fall of 1999.

 FULLER UP 
</P>
<P>
 College basketball teams begin practice Saturday, signaling the start of the 
Tony Fuller era at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller, who replaced Tom Asbury as coach, will conduct his first practice at 1 
p.m. at Firestone Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do a lot of conditioning and play a couple pickup games," 
Fuller said. "I'm really excited to get a chance to work with my team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves, however, will be without 6-foot-11 center Gavin Vanderputten and 
7-1 center Jamar Holcomb. Vanderputten underwent arthroscopic surgery on his 
right knee three weeks ago and Holcomb broke a knuckle on his left hand. 
Vanderputten is expected to miss a week of practice and Holcomb will be out six 
to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller says he has a young team and will not expect too much too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be a lot of teaching and a lot repetition," Fuller said. "I 
don't want them to try and get into midseason form by the first week of 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller has been busy scheduling tournaments for future seasons. The Waves will 
compete in tournaments at New Mexico and Nebraska in 1995, at Syracuse and 
Arizona State in 1996 and at Brigham Young University in 1997. RECRUITING TRAIL

 Matt Jager, a prized basketball prospect from Vista High of San Diego, lists 
Pepperdine as one of his semifinalists, according to his coach, Kevin 
Barbarick. 
</P>
<P>
 Jager, a 6-foot-6 forward, averaged 23 points, eight rebounds and four assists 
and was selected to the all-state team by Cal-Hi Sports magazine. He is also a 
two-time selection to the All-San Diego County team and participated in the 
Adidas ABCD national basketball camp in Teaneck, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Jager also is considering Ohio University, Oregon State and Brigham Young. 
</P>

 The early signing period begins Nov. 9. GAME OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City can take pride in the fact that it was the only high school 
football team to beat Mira Costa last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centaurs defeated the 1993 Division VII champions, 21-20, when Mira Costa 
running back Phil Fonua fumbled during the closing minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only loss for Mira Costa under Coach Don Morrow, who has a 17-1 
record in two seasons. The two teams meet Friday at Mira Costa in a game that 
could determine the Ocean League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "They like to pound the ball down your throat," Culver City Coach Robert Moore 
said. "They have bigger players than we do and they like to play smash-mouth 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Mustangs beat Beverly Hills, 27-7. Mira Costa had 297 rushing 
yards, including 164 yards and two touchdowns from standout running back Mike 
Fikes. Aki Wilson rushed for 157 yards and two touchdowns as Culver City beat 
Morningside, 30-18. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their biggest weakness is that they can't pass," Moore said. "We just hope 
they fall behind and have to worry about the clock." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs will be without Fonua and Dino Rossi, two All-Southern Section 
Division VII all-stars. Fonua, a preseason All-American nose tackle, suffered a 
ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Rossi, a receiver and defensive back, had surgery 
to repair a torn knee ligament. SPECIAL K

 Kiff Kimber has been selected men's and women's swimming coach at Santa Monica 
College, Athletic Director Avie Bridges said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimber has been the Corsair women's swimming coach the past two seasons and 
worked with men's coach Stu Blumkin. Kimber and Blumkin were hired as part-time 
coaches in 1992 when longtime men's and women's coach John Joseph retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges said the school made a decision to combine both programs under one 
part-time coach in the spring because of budgetary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimber, Blumkin and two other candidates were interviewed for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased to have Kiff," Bridges said. "We feel she has done an excellent 
job in the past and we're looking forward to her directing both programs to a 
new level and new era." 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to arriving at Santa Monica, Kimber was the head men's and women's 
swimming and diving coach at El Camino College from 1983-88. She was a physical 
education instructor at UC San Diego in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimber, who has a master's degree from Long Beach State, is currently a 
part-time physical education instructor at Santa Monica and East Los Angeles 
colleges. QUOTEBOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Yarnall, a longtime St. Bernard baseball coach who was pressed into 
service as a football coach, talked about the difference between coaching the 
two sports: "In baseball, you pat them on the back. In football, you kick them 
in the rear. In football, you watch game films to try and find your opponents' 
weaknesses and then exploit them. In baseball, you try to find your weakness 
and hide him in right field. Baseball is a thinking man's sport. Football is a 
rah-rah sport.". . . .

COVER STORY; STUDENTS GET TRAINING FOR TOMORROW'S WORLD; LIKE ITS NAMESAKE, 
JACKIE ROBINSON ACADEMY IS A TRAILBLAZER; LANGUAGES, COMPUTERS ARE STRESSED 
</P>

<P>
 Jim Morin stands in front of a hazy chalkboard filled with scribbling as he 
surveys two lines of blue-and-white-clad fifth- and sixth-graders entering his 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh air wafts through an open doorway as the students burst into the 
sparsely decorated room, filling it with chatter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kiritsu!" he says with voice raised, demanding their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kyotsuke!" he commands. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, accustomed to daily ritual, quickly come to order. Then bowing, 
they greet their instructor with a "good morning." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohayo gozaimasu, " they say in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, students in other classes break into choruses of "buenos dias" or 
"bonjour. " 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Jackie Robinson Academy, the Long Beach School District's newest 
and arguably most radical school. Younger students spend up to 90% of their 
school day immersed in a language -- French, Japanese or Spanish. Students in 
the upper grades receive up to half their instruction in a foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of planning, the academy opened its doors last month to 572 
students from pre-kindergarten to sixth grade. Another 425 students were turned 
away, an indication that the academy is one of the district's most popular 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 And for ample reason. 
</P>
<P>
 The language immersion program is one of several efforts to help prepare 
students for a diverse, global, high-tech society. Officials said they selected 
French, Japanese and Spanish because those languages are used often in 
international business. 
</P>
<P>
 Each class has access to sophisticated computer systems to allow students to 
communicate and share assignments with children throughout the state and the 
country, as well as allowing them access to data around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is the only school in the district that takes the Montessori approach, 
a private school technique in which children are grouped together by ability 
rather than age and encouraged to progress at their own pace. Some classes have 
children three years apart in age. Instructors say grouping children in this 
fashion encourages independence and fosters self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 At the school, children with physical or learning disabilities, rather than 
being placed in classes by themselves, are included in general classes and 
offered the same learning environment as other students. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators have created an ethnically balanced student body that mirrors 
the racial and ethnic composition of the city. White students make up 23% of 
the enrollment; blacks, 27%; Latinos, 32%; Asians, 5%; Filipinos, 9%, and other 
groups, such as Native Americans and Pacific Islanders, 4%. The school received 
a $550,000 federal grant awarded to districts to help desegregation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 By emphasizing a diverse enrollment, foreign languages and computer 
technology, "we're trying to start off early to give students skills they need 
to participate in the 21st Century," said area Supt. Dorothy Harper. "It's a 
new way of teaching and a new way of learning." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's only requirement for admission is that parents get involved in 
school activities. Before their children could be considered for enrollment, 
parents had to agree to devote at least 20 hours for the school year to 
school-related activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The requirement proved no obstacle as parents throughout the district 
scrambled to sign up their children for the new $7.6-million school on Pine 
Avenue across from Veterans Memorial Park on the west side of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Dilcia Francis said she signed up her two sons and drives them to and 
from school each day. Francis, a native of Honduras, said she wants her sons, 
Hiram and Zahir, to become fluent in Spanish. "I want them to have the language 
skills," Francis said. "It will keep them in touch with their roots." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 During the first week, administrators and teachers encountered some rough 
spots as they labored to launch Robinson's ambitious academic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In some classes, students initially resisted teachers' efforts to immerse them 
in a foreign language, repeatedly asking instructors to speak in English. In 
most cases, teachers work with the children if they become frustrated by 
rephrasing what was said or by asking a bilingual student to assist in 
translating for their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were delays in introducing certain subjects as some teachers took 
extra time to plan lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is new for all of us," said Morin, who is teaching for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his lack of teaching experience, Morin was hired because he is fluent 
in Japanese. He learned the language during a two-year stay there as a 
missionary. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's teachers are relatively inexperienced -- administrators placed a 
premium on recruiting teachers with strong bilingual skills, said Principal 
Erlinda Teisinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 22 teachers, seven are teaching for the first time. Many are taking 
classes themselves to improve their teaching and bilingual skills. This is not 
particularly unusual since there is a shortage of qualified bilingual 
educators, Teisinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morin, who decided to switch to teaching after eight years as an accountant in 
the district, is going to night school to earn a teaching credential and 
certification as a bilingual teacher.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he decided to leave his accounting position -- taking a pay cut -- "to 
be involved in something more personally satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Teisinger, who is fluent in four languages, was hired in February from Fresno, 
where she earned accolades for developing innovative high-tech and science 
programs at Balderas Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fresno school, which she opened in 1990, has been recognized by the U.S. 
Department of Education as one of the country's 200 most innovative schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw my kids operating on cow's eyes, experimenting with plants in botany 
class and doing other hands-on science projects," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach officials say Teisinger has been the driving force behind the 
academy's emphasis on high-tech and computers. Recently she sent out a plea for 
more computers through the school district's newsletter. The school received a 
total of 90 computers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to pushing for a greater emphasis on teaching computer and other 
technological skills, Teisinger has been recruiting private industry and higher 
education institutions to get involved with programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring Pacific Hospital of Long Beach has agreed to present health 
lessons, and Cal State Long Beach is training the school's bilingual teachers. 
Hughes Aircraft Co. is donating a satellite dish and fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
 But the foreign language immersion classes are the centerpiece of the school's 
program.  
</P>
<P>
 Teisinger, who has taught language immersion classes, credits bilingual 
programs for her fluency in Spanish, Tagalog and Ilocano, a Filipino dialect.  
</P>
<P>
 Maria Quezada, a language specialist who provides training for Jackie Robinson 
Academy's bilingual teachers, says bilingual immersion programs help students' 
overall academic performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids really become attuned to language so they become more analytic of 
English," said Quezada, director of the Multifunctional Resource Center at Cal 
State Long Beach. "These skills transfer from one language to another. And 
English is not lost. English is enhanced." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, studies indicate that English-speaking students in bilingual programs 
gain an academic edge over their traditionally educated peers, said David 
Ramirez, executive director for the Center for Language Minority Education and 
Research at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They end up scoring higher on (IQ tests) compared to their peers," said 
Ramirez, who conducted a national study of the impact of bilingual programs on 
learning. "They seem to exhibit higher thinking skills, greater flexibility 
with new situations and challenges. They are just brighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez helped develop and design Robinson's foreign language program. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Morin speaks enthusiastically about preliminary plans for a 
three-year economics curriculum that he intends to teach in Japanese and 
English to the academy's older students. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Morin's fifth- and sixth-graders have been getting 10% of their 
instruction in Japanese, an equivalent of about 45 minutes a day, he says. Most 
of the instruction consists of familiarizing the students with the Japanese 
alphabet and numbers, as well as simple commands and greetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really all we've got time for. At least the first half of the year," 
he said. "When they get more comfortable with numbers, I will start integrating 
the financial curriculum with that."  
</P>
<P>
 In his sparely decorated room, accented by a handful of fern-like plants and a 
plastic map of Japan, Morin describes his plans to teach the school's 
sixth-graders about the value of money. He hopes to introduce a "Jackie 
Robinson dollar" (a currency equivalent to the U.S. dollar) that can be used to 
exchange goods and services at student-run "businesses." With the aid of 
computer programs, students will manage personal budgets. Students will also 
learn about international currency systems such as the yen or the franc, as 
well as rates of exchange, Morin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's something for the future. On this Tuesday morning, it was time for 
some of his students to head out to the school's field for a firsthand lesson 
-- in English -- about the physics of hot-air balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 A kaleidoscope of colors -- mauve, purple, gray, green, yellow, orange and red 
-- were splashed across a nylon canvas that rose gradually as an operator fired 
up burners to inflate the balloon. Students took pictures of the colorful blob 
as it slowly expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 children -- five from Morin's class -- took turns riding in the 
wicker basket, the gondola, which took off several feet from the ground as 
burners heated air inside the balloon. Afterward, the children gushed about 
their science lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven-year-old Nubia Torres exclaimed: "This is fun. We learn by doing, not 
by reading books. It's exciting."
