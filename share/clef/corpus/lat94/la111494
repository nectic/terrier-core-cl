 NOW OR NEVER?: For Ventura County fans of minor league baseball, this week 
might be the equivalent of the bottom of the ninth inning . . . Ventura is 
first up at bat among three cities deciding whether to support a proposed minor 
league baseball stadium (B1). Oxnard and Camarillo will also face the issue. 
Two big questions: Who would foot the $15-million bill and would fans come? . . 
. The last local venture into Class A baseball -- the Ventura County Gulls -- 
lasted a single season in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 BURN, BABY, BURN: All those campaign signs that have littered the landscape 
for the past few months should be cleared out within about a week, under state 
and city laws . . . One Thousand Oaks City Council candidate has come up with a 
novel approach to get rid of his signs. Lance Winslow, who finished eighth 
among the 16 contestants, says residents who remove his plywood signs can burn 
them for firewood. Given the bitterness of the Thousand Oaks race, some of his 
former foes may welcome the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 CLEAN CLASS: A day spent cleaning up the county's beaches has become an annual 
ritual for some county residents. . . . But about 50 children at Oxnard's 
Emilie Ritchen School are taking that notion a step further and devoting one 
day every two weeks to removing trash and planting flora at McGrath State Beach 
(B1). They hope to resuscitate the beach, which was damaged in an oil spill 
last year, and study natural science. "I want to show that kids can make a 
difference," said Christina Little, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 CLOSED DOOR: Closing high school campuses during school hours can be tough on 
students when an entire student body must rush to eat in a single lunch period 
(Voices, Page B10). . . . But in Ventura County and throughout Southern 
California, an increasing number of campuses are being closed for safety 
reasons. In Oxnard, all six of the high school district's campuses are closed 
-- a policy officials say has helped cut down on truancy.

49ERS STRUT PAST COWBOYS; NFC: SAN FRANCISCO BIDS TO BE BEST IN CONFERENCE -- 
AND LEAGUE -- WITH 21-14 VICTORY OVER DALLAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So that is what it looks like when you shed the weight of the pro football 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young danced Sunday afternoon. The quiet quarterback of the San 
Francisco 49ers skipped and twirled and waved his fingers at the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 For 20 seconds that must have felt like two years, he waltzed around the 
battered reputation of the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates had never seen it before -- "I didn't think Mormons were allowed 
to dance," Harris Barton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, most of them had never seen anything like the 49ers' 21-14 victory 
over the mighty Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a record crowd of 69,014 at Candlestick Park, it was a triumph not only 
for the standings, but the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing to the Cowboys three times in the previous two seasons -- twice 
with a Super Bowl appearance at stake -- the revamped 49ers finally got it 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 They got physical. They got nasty. They got inside not only the Cowboys' end 
zone, but the Cowboys' heads. 
</P>
<P>
 And they got it with flair. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Young, an artist with welts, dancing through the end zone after 
throwing a 13-yard touchdown pass to Brent Jones in the final three minutes to 
give the 49ers a 21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Young vs. Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman? Young vs. the memory of Joe Montana? 
</P>
<P>
 Both contests were no contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, Steve got the monkey off his back," Barton said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Merton Hanks, nearly four minutes earlier, strutting across the 
field after intercepting Aikman in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding the football as if it were a hammer, Hanks swung it to the ground once 
for every time he remembered the Cowboys ruining his season. 
</P>
<P>
 Swung it three times, then left it spinning on the ground, as out of control 
as the NFL's new order of power. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no longer the Cowboys, then everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now the Cowboys and 49ers, equals not only in record (8-2) but in 
stature. And nobody else. 
</P>
<P>
 They will probably meet again in the NFC championship game Jan. 15. The winner 
of that game will probably be the favorite in the Super Bowl two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, if the winner can walk. 
</P>
<P>
 From the ninth play Sunday, when 49er tackle Steve Wallace stood after the 
whistle had blown and butted heads with Cowboy Charles Haley, this was a 
football game that resembled a heavyweight fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was Emmitt Smith held to three yards per carry -- 78 yards total -- 
but he was subject to constant taunting from linebackers Ken Norton Jr. and 
Gary Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
 And to think that Norton was a former teammate and friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to rub it in now -- what happened during that game rubbed it 
in," Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Aikman throw three interceptions and suffer through three sacks, 
but often he heard the howls and saw the pointing fingers of pass rushers 
Rickey Jackson and Dana Stubblefield. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to see how the Cowboys could react to somebody actually playing 
smash-mouth football with them," said 49er linebacker Gary Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer? Good early. Bad late. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, even though the game was tied at 7-all, the Cowboys had outgained 
the 49ers, 237-98. Young had exactly one passing yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys could have been leading had Aikman not thrown one of his three 
interceptions and if clock mismanagement by Coach Barry Switzer didn't force 
them to rush a last-second, 43-yard field goal that Chris Boniol missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up at the scoreboard and I thought it said I had zero passing 
yards," said Young, who had been hounded by the quick Cowboy defense. "I 
thought, 'How can we tie a game during a half when I have zero passing yards?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 A more important question might be, how come the Cowboys couldn't handle what 
happened next? 
</P>
<P>
 The constant pressure from the physical 49er defense finally wore down the 
Cowboys in the third quarter. In their first three possessions, they gained 28 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 That set up the 49ers' go-ahead strike, a 40-yard heave from Young to receiver 
Jerry Rice on the first play of a series with 2:48 remaining in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice turned and caught the ball over defender Larry Brown, then shrugged him 
off and ran into the end zone to give the 49ers the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve Young has taken so much heat for our last three losses when it was 
really the fault of the defense," Hanks said. "That's why today was so big." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Young threw for only 183 yards -- Aikman threw for 339 -- Young 
rushed for 60 yards on a variety of bootlegs that led to two 49er scores. 
</P>
<P>
 And Young did not throw an interception. One of Aikman's interceptions was 
made at the three-yard line in the first half and another was made at the goal 
line with 5:03 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the crucial pickoffs were by Hanks, who said, "Troy throws a nice 
ball. He has a real nice touch." 
</P>
<P>
 That final interception, which set up the drive that led to Young's 
game-clinching pass to Jones, occurred after Aikman had thrown behind Jay 
Novacek. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanks simply stepped up and grabbed the ball almost off Novacek's back 
shoulder. For once, Deion Sanders, who played despite suffering a dislocated 
middle finger after an interception in the second quarter, was not the 
defensive backfield star. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are going to be a great team, this is how it happens sometimes," Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the 49ers proved, for once, that they must be considered a . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to say they are a better team, but I'm not sure," Switzer said 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, he wasn't watching.

RAIDERS RULE BLACK-AND-BLUE DAY; PRO FOOTBALL: BOTH QUARTERBACKS INJURED, 
VIOLENCE EXTENDS TO STANDS DURING 20-17 VICTORY OVER RAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Emotions clashed, bodies were flying everywhere, and while the spectators were 
making a spectacle of themselves, the Rams and Raiders made their pitch for 
respectability Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, loud and clear in their resolve, changed their offensive 
personality, knocked out Rams quarterback Chris Chandler and survived the loss 
of quarterback Jeff Hostetler to escape with a 20-17 victory before 65,208 in 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders (5-5) not only recorded their sixth victory in eight meetings with 
the Rams, but in climbing to .500 they can continue to entertain themselves 
with playoff talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a win we had to have," said Raider Coach Art Shell. "The teams that 
move on to January are the teams that win in November and December." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams (4-6) might move on to St. Louis or Baltimore come January. First 
comes a date with San Francisco next week after a suitable mourning period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel more down now than after any other loss," said Ram linebacker Roman 
Phifer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who have failed to win consecutive games since 1991, rallied from a 
17-7 fourth-quarter deficit, but for the fourth time this season suffered a 
loss by seven or fewer points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played about as hard as we can play," Knox said. "They made maybe one more 
play than we did and that was the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams played under the handicap of losing their starting quarterbacks, 
but Hostetler staked the Raiders to a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter 
before leaving with a toe injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sort of concerned," said Hostetler, who said his injury was not serious 
and who completed 17 of 25 passes for 218 yards. "It was like Rice Krispies 
(snap, crackle and pop). But the pain subsided." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider offense, which had been criticized for its reliance on running back 
Harvey Williams and wide receiver Tim Brown, took on a "We Are Family" look 
from the start. Hostetler not only threw a first-quarter 27-yard touchdown pass 
to tight end Andrew Glover, but came back later to find Raghib Ismail for a 
10-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 He also completed the first pass of the year to tight end Jamie Williams and 
handed the ball off for the first time to rookie running back Calvin Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, however, still emerged as the Raiders' leading receiver, with five 
catches for 53 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hostetler spread it around pretty good and they just nickle-and-dimed us to 
death," Phifer said. "We couldn't get them off the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders held the ball for nine more minutes than the Rams, and took away 
their opponent's top offensive weapon: running back Jerome Bettis. Bettis ran 
10 times for 13 yards and the Rams' rushing total of 22 yards tied the 
second-lowest mark in team history. The Rams managed only 22 yards against 
Detroit in 1962, and 15 vs. San Francisco in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 While security officials wrestled with an unruly crowd, making 14 arrests and 
55 ejections, the Rams fought to get back into the game after losing Chandler 
because of a sprained ankle in the second quarter. Chandler had completed 10 of 
11 passes for 171 yards before Raider defensive tackle Chester McGlockton 
rolled across his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely have had bad luck at the wrong times," Chandler said, while 
leaning on crutches. "How do you explain it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Miller, who is struggling to overcome a concussion suffered Oct. 23, 
replaced Chandler and completed 13 of 26 passes for 131 yards. He threw the 
ball on 21 consecutive plays in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel pressure on my eyes, but it's more like whiplash in my neck," 
Miller said. "I felt fine, though, throwing the ball, but we just couldn't get 
it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler's loss forced wide receiver Todd Kinchen to step in and hold for 
kicker Tony Zendejas, who had made his last 12 field-goal tries. However, in 
their first effort together in the second quarter, Zendejas was wide left from 
41 yards, and the lost three points would come back to haunt him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had a chance to come from behind in the second half after the Raiders 
failed to make it 21-7 on fourth-and-goal from the one. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram linebacker Shane Conlan rocked a leaping Williams and shut him down for no 
gain at the goal line, thereby irritating the Raiders and prompting a 15-yard 
unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders added a 44-yard field goal by Jeff Jaeger in the opening minutes 
of the fourth quarter to extend their lead to 17-7, but the Rams responded with 
a 22-yard field goal by Zendejas. While successful in regaining the ball a few 
minutes later, they quickly lost their opportunity to tie the game when Raider 
cornerback Terry McDaniel intercepted a pass by Miller at the Ram 34-yard line 
and returned it to the 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeger came on again to hit from 47 yards, and then the Rams marched 71 yards 
in seven plays, capped by Miller's four-yard scoring toss to Kinchen to set up 
an onside kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the player the Raiders rely on so much, fell on the kick and the 
Raiders had their victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been knocked down so many times," said Ram cornerback Todd Lyght. "It's 
tough to keep getting up, but we have no choice. We have the 49ers this week."

SEATTLE DEALS CLIPPERS A FIFTH LOSS; PRO BASKETBALL: TEAM'S WORST START IN A 
DECADE CONTINUES AS LOS ANGELES CAN'T MATCH SUPERSONICS' STRENGTH OFF THE BENCH 
IN A 115-90 DEFEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Seattle disc jockey was giving away tickets to Sunday night's Seattle 
SuperSonics-Clippers game at the Tacoma Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of giving them to the first caller, as normally is the case in radio 
promotions, the tickets went to the last caller because the SuperSonics were 
playing the Clippers, the favorite to finish last in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Clippers looked like a last-place team, losing for the fifth time in 
as many games, 115-90, before a crowd of 16,352. 
</P>
<P>
 Off to the worst start since the club moved to Los Angeles in 1984 and the 
second-worst start in franchise history, the Clippers trailed by as many as 30 
points in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing takes a lot out of you, it really does," said forward Loy Vaught, who 
made 11 of 12 shots and had 23 points and nine rebounds. "We're trying to 
handle it well. But when you're losing, sometimes you start bickering. We're 
trying to keep in mind that we're very young and we're new to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to start winning. This is tough, but it can't go on forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA's worst free-throw-shooting team, the Clippers, who shot 64.4% from 
the line in their first four games, Sunday made only 21 of 41 free throws 
(51.2%). 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bill Fitch sighed as he studied the statistics sheet after the 
game. Fitch waved off the first two questions until a reporter asked about his 
team's poor free-throw shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody ask the question," Fitch said. "I thought we ought to clear the air 
right away. It (free-throw shooting) was terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about carrying a lot of things from practice to the games. Our 
free-throw shooting in practice has been very good. Some of the guys that are 
missing these free throws have shot well in practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper forward Harold Ellis made only three of 10, and center Elmore Spencer 
missed all four of his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it is confidence and being in shape," Ellis said. "When you get 
tired, you don't shoot as well. I missed a lot of free throws. Everybody missed 
a lot of free throws. Maybe if we had all those free throws back . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But free-throw shooting wasn't the Clippers' only problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle's reserves outscored the Clipper reserves, 45-22. SuperSonic reserve 
swingman Vincent Askew had a career-high 20 points, four rebounds and three 
assists in 28 minutes, and reserve guard Sarunas Marciulionis had 15 points, 
two steals, two assists and two rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wear you down," Fitch said of Seattle's bench. "The second half, when we 
went to the bench, it was even more obvious that the rookies (Lamond Murray, 
Eric Piatkowski and Matt Fish) aren't ready to play against the veteran 
players. But the only way you find that out and the way you get them ready to 
play against the veteran players is to throw them out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't waving the white flag (when he played the three rookies at the same 
time in the fourth quarter), but it really caved in then and we just left them 
out there to get their growing pains in. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Seattle is a good ball club. If they smell the blood, they take advantage 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics smelled blood in the third quarter, outscoring the Clippers, 
10-0, in a three-minute spurt midway through the period to take control of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 All-star forward Shawn Kemp scored 17 points and had 11 rebounds and Detlef 
Schrempf scored 18 points as Seattle won for the third time in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, the NBA's third-lowest scoring team, looked cohesive on offense 
in the first half, shooting a season-high 50% as Vaught hit nine of 10 shots 
and scored 18 points to keep it close (58-49). 
</P>
<P>
 But Vaught scored only five points in the second half, making both shots he 
took. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Loy got tired," Fitch said. "The one thing he's weak at is that he 
doesn't play well tired. Great players, somewhere along the line, have to learn 
to play at the top their game when fatigue sets in because that's when the team 
needs them. . . . He came off the floor and I hit him and it was like hitting a 
sponge, he was so wet. He was playing tired." Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The worst start in franchise history was when the San Diego Clippers opened 
the 1982-83 season with seven consecutive losses. . . . Center Elmore Spencer, 
who has struggled since averaging 10.5 points in the Clippers' season-opening 
games in Japan, had two points and six rebounds in 21 minutes. . . . The 
Clippers, who led the league in turnovers last season, had 20 turnovers, which 
the SuperSonics converted into 23 points.

BRONCOS GET BIG GAME FROM NEWLYWED RUSSELL; AFC: RUNNING BACK RUSHES FOR 109 
YARDS AND SCORES GAME-WINNING TOUCHDOWN IN 17-10 VICTORY OVER SEAHAWKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apparently, married life agrees with Leonard Russell. So do the Seattle 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, whose wedding was on Saturday, ran for 109 yards Sunday, including an 
11-yard touchdown run with 5:43 to play, as the Denver Broncos defeated the 
Seattle Seahawks, 17-10, to escape the AFC West cellar. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, whose two 100-yard rushing games this season were both against the 
Seahawks, broke a 10-10 tie with his slashing run off the left side, capping an 
80-yard, nine-play drive. Russell started the drive with a 20-yard run, and 
John Elway completed all five of his passes on the march. 
</P>
<P>
 "All through my career, I've played well against Seattle," Russell said. "I 
don't have an answer for that." 
</P>
<P>
 While declining comment on his marriage -- "I'll keep you guessing," he told 
reporters -- Russell apologized to his teammates for the turmoil of the past 
week. He was arrested for disorderly conduct early Monday after an altercation 
in a local bar, but Bronco Coach Wade Phillips absolved him of blame, saying 
the other man threw the first punch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a real rough week and I had to make it up to my teammates for putting 
them through what I did," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos (4-6), who have won four of their last six games and have won five 
in a row over the Seahawks, then stopped Seattle near the Broncos' 20-yard line 
to hand the fading Seahawks (3-7) their sixth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having Leonard Russell go over 100 yards helped us," Phillips said. "He's 
tough, he's difficult to stop. John Elway scrambled for some big plays, and I 
thought our defense played great." 
</P>
<P>
 Denver, which came into the game with the worst defense in the league, giving 
up 368.8 yards a game, limited the Seahawks to 289. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle had pulled into a 10-10 tie with 11:39 left on Chris Warren's 23-yard 
romp up the middle, finishing a 43-yard drive that started with cornerback 
Orlando Watters' interception.

 Sometimes when it's cold and wet, it doesn't matter who makes the most 
mistakes. It's who makes the worst mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas City Chiefs held Natrone Means to 55 yards in 21 carries. They 
forced a swarm of San Diego turnovers. But the most critical error on a gray 
day turned out to be the last, and the Chargers (8-2) were grateful for a 14-13 
victory Sunday that put them two games ahead of the Chiefs (6-4) in the AFC 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 The key play came when Joe Montana's pass glanced off rookie Lake Dawson's 
hands into the clutches of the Chargers' Darren Carrington with eight minutes 
to play. Carrington returned the interception 19 yards to the Kansas City 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on third and goal from the five, Stan Humphries passed to a wide-open 
Duane Young in the corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 There was not a defender within 10 yards of Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure somebody was supposed to cover me and made a mistake," Young said. 
"It's nice to be at the point where the other team is making the mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Carrington's interception, the Chargers had not begun an offensive play 
closer to the goal line than the Kansas City 40. 
</P>
<P>
 But they trailed only 13-7, having scored with 30 seconds left in the third 
quarter on a 52-yard pass play, Humphries to Shawn Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson got behind Mark Collins and hauled in Humphries' pass at the 15, put 
a move on the nine-year veteran from Cal State Fullerton and scored. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers committed four turnovers in the first half, when the Chiefs took 
a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana was working without his best running back, Marcus Allen, his best 
blocker, tackle John Alt, and his best pass-catcher, J.J. Birden, all of whom 
were injured. And the Chiefs scored only one touchdown for the second game in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana grimaced when asked about Carrington's interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts more when you know you have the game and for one play . . . those 
are the kind of things that make you sick. If the ball just hits the ground and 
it's incomplete, or if he catches it, it's a completely different game at that 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 Means, the AFC's leading rusher, was held to 55 yards in 21 carries. He ran 
for 125 yards in a 20-6 victory over the Chiefs last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we're in first place, but we're not in the driver's seat. It's not over 
yet," said Charger Coach Bobby Ross. "That was one of the most intense games 
I've ever coached in. There was a grittiness and toughness on both teams." 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first quarter, the Chiefs got the game's first big break 
when Tracy Simien recovered Means' fumble on the Charger 30 to set up Lin 
Elliott's 27-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Carter's 30-yard punt return a few minutes later set up Montana at the 
San Diego 28, and on the first play he passed to Dawson for 24 yards to the 
eight. Anders scored from the one, and the Chiefs led, 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
 From the San Diego 21, Humphries then tried a sideline pass that Collins 
anticipated, stepping in to make the interception as he went out of bounds on 
the 29. Elliott's 34-yarder made the score 13-0 with three seconds left in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers swept the season series after losing eight of the last nine 
regular-season games with the Chiefs.

BROWNS DON'T LET EAGLES SOAR; INTERCONFERENCE: DEFENSE IS DOMINANT IN 26-7 
VICTORY OVER PHILADELPHIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The bend-don't-break Cleveland Brown defense barely budged Sunday during a 
26-7 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns, who got four field goals from Matt Stover, limited the Eagles to 
288 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our trademark has been not to give up a lot of points," said Coach Bill 
Belichick, whose Browns have given up a league-low 11.8 points a game. "We were 
able to make some big plays when Philadelphia did get the ball down there on 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Rypien, who completed 12 of 30 passes for 158 yards, hooked up with Mark 
Carrier on a three-yard touchdown pass and Ernest Byner scored on a four-yard 
run to give the Browns (8-2) their seventh victory in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Rypien said the Brown offense decided that it wasn't going to give the Eagle 
defense the chance to make big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that got a lot of teams in trouble (against the Eagles) is holding 
the football," Rypien said. "Sometimes the key against this defense is not 
making a big play, but simply knowing when to throw the ball away." 
</P>
<P>
 In losing for the first time in their last seven home games, the Eagles (7-3) 
got their only touchdown on Vaughn Hebron's 15-yard run in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Cunningham, whose streak of winning starts at Veterans Stadium was 
ended at 20, completed 22 of 38 passes for 195 yards, with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham, who was sacked twice, also fumbled late in the third quarter after 
the Eagles, trailing by 12 points, had moved to the Cleveland 13. Don Griffin 
recovered for the Browns, who drove to Byner's touchdown early in the fourth 
quarter. "Their defense is just like NFC East teams," Cunningham said. "They'll 
definitely be in the playoffs. They're probably the best team in the AFC. The 
way they played today, they can win the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland, ranked 16th in the NFL in defense, outplayed the second-ranked 
Eagle defense, which mustered no sacks and little pressure on Rypien, who 
started again in place of Vinny Testaverde. Testaverde sat out his second 
consecutive game because of a concussion and neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles, the NFL's second-most penalized team, hurt themselves again. They 
had nine penalties for 84 yards, and four gave the Browns first downs. 
Cleveland won despite seven penalties for 97 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle Coach Rich Kotite said his team was flat after an emotional victory over 
the Arizona Cardinals and former Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to this, we'd won seven of our last eight games (and) the reason was 
the enthusiasm we had," Kotite said. "But I felt we just didn't play with a lot 
of enthusiasm and fire off the ball."

BEUERLEIN GETS A WIN FOR BUDDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apparently it doesn't make a difference who plays quarterback for the New York 
Giants. Someone is going to find a way to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, it was a quarterback whose rating was worse than recently benched 
Giant Dave Brown and a rookie wide receiver whom Buddy Ryan refers to as No. 
80. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Beuerlein delivered a floating nine-yard pass and Bryan Reeves made a 
superb catch at the back of the end zone with 1:39 to play as the Arizona 
Cardinals rallied to defeat the Giants, 10-9, to extend New York's longest 
losing streak since 1980 to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 The slide is the longest of Dan Reeves' 14-year coaching career and it came in 
a game in which the Giants (3-7) squandered a 9-0 halftime lead and the 
Cardinals (4-6) rallied to win for the first time at Giants Stadium since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all hurt," said Reeves, whose worst skid before this was six in a row 
with the Denver Broncos in 1990. "The longer it goes, the more it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves had hoped to jump-start the Giants by starting Kent Graham at 
quarterback instead of Brown, who had thrown 10 interceptions in the losing 
streak and had seen his rating dip to 65.5. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy nearly worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to win, but it's hard to really enjoy it," said Beuerlein, who 
was inconsistent but managed to complete 17 of 33 passes for 180 yards, with 
one interception. "We made it difficult. It should have been a lot easier. But 
it's better to win ugly than lose pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 Beuerlein's 59.9 rating is second worst in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, which limited the Giants to 56 second-half yards, drove 54 yards for 
the game-winning score, with Beuerlein completing four of seven passes for 53 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 On Reeves' catch, it appeared that he may have previously stepped out of the 
end zone, but the officials said he was inbounds.

OPPORTUNISTIC PACKERS FIND JETS MISSING A LOTT; INTERCONFERENCE: GREEN BAY 
PICKS ON BACKUP SAFETY TERRELL IN 17-10 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Jets finally hurt themselves with their bruising defense as the 
Green Bay Packers exploited the absence of injured safety Ronnie Lott. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Brett Favre picked on Lott's backup, Pat Terrell, for two 
touchdowns as the Packers defeated the Jets, 17-10, on a rainy Sunday, 
extending Green Bay's winning streak at Lambeau Field to eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Lott, who leads the Jets (5-5) with 79 tackles, didn't play because of a 
pinched nerve in his shoulder suffered while making a tackle in last week's 
22-17 victory over the Buffalo Bills. That ended his string of 57 consecutive 
starts dating to Dec. 3, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't picking on me," Terrell insisted. "I thought I played well. I 
thought we played well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets drove to the Green Bay nine with 1:04 to play, and on fourth and 
three, Rob Moore beat cornerback Doug Evans before slipping and watching Boomer 
Esiason's pass skip off his outstretched left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to pick on Evans at times," Jet Coach Pete Carroll said. "But on 
that final play we didn't get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the fourth quarter, a 42-yard pass to Moore over Evans initially 
was signaled a touchdown before a second official overruled, saying he never 
had possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed to be more of an adventure than we'd like to have," Packer Coach 
Mike Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
 The critical call helped the Packers (6-4) to their third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Favre completed 20 of 28 passes for 183 yards and two touchdowns, with no 
interceptions, and led the Packers to victory despite the loss of fullback 
Edgar Bennett, their top rusher, and wideout Sterling Sharpe, their best 
receiver, both of whom left the game after suffering injuries.

BIZARRE FAKE FIELD GOAL HELPFUL TO BEARS; INTERCONFERENCE: CONWAY'S DESPERATE 
PASS DEFLECTS OFF INTENDED RECEIVER AND TURNS INTO A TOUCHDOWN IN 17-14 VICTORY 
OVER DOLPHINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Kevin Butler went from decoy to hero. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Bears scored their first touchdown on a bizarre fake field goal, 
and Butler won a last-minute kicking duel with Pete Stoyanovich to give the 
Bears a 17-14 victory over the Miami Dolphins on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler kicked a 40-yard field goal with 59 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Miami's Dan Marino, working without any timeouts, completed two passes 
for 38 yards to give Stoyanovich a chance to force an overtime, but his 45-yard 
attempt was tipped by Chicago's James Williams with two seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoyanovich failed on a game-tying or game-winning kick in the fourth quarter 
for only the third time in 16 attempts. He said this one would have been good 
if not for the 6-foot-7 Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The snap was good, the hold was good, but there was some push in the middle 
of the field and he was able to get a hand up," Stoyanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 AFC East leader Miami fell to 7-3. Chicago improved to 6-4, and starting 
quarterback Steve Walsh remained unbeaten at 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear receiver Chris Conway threw the game's most memorable pass, a desperate 
heave on the fake field goal. His pass deflected off intended receiver Jerry 
Fontenot -- a center-guard -- to Keith Jennings, who caught the ball at the 
five and took it in to complete a 23-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't supposed to be near the play," Jennings said. "I was just standing 
there watching the play and I saw him throw it to Jerry. I said, 'I'd better 
get over there, because I know Jerry isn't going to catch the ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Really a fluke," Miami Coach Don Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
 The playground play that gave the Bears a 7-3 lead began from a field-goal 
formation so strange that Bear Coach Dave Wannstedt diagramed it for the 
officials before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Tight end Marv Cook snapped the ball and was an eligible receiver because the 
other offensive linemen were split several yards to his left. Butler and holder 
Chris Gardocki lined up behind Cook as if to try a 40-yard field goal, but the 
snap instead went diagonally to Conway, who was lined up behind the other 
linemen to Butler's left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears tried the play, called "swinging gate," once earlier this season. 
Officials called it back, ruling the ball wasn't in play when it was snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Both offenses were efficient in the fourth quarter. Walsh completed three 
passes for 64 yards to set up a one-yard touchdown run by Lewis Tillman, giving 
Chicago a 14-6 lead with 11 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino responded by directing a 69-yard touchdown drive and capped it on third 
down with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Keith Jackson. Aaron Craver ran for the 
two-point conversion to tie the score at 14-14 with 5:46 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh then directed a 47-yard drive to set up the winning kick.

AFTER LOSS, RAMS ARE LOOKING FORWARD; INTERCONFERENCE: CHANCE FOR WINNING 
SEASON LIES IN SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN DIEGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram linebacker Shane Conlan finished with a game-high 11 tackles and his 
goal-line piledriver on a leaping Harvey Williams stopped the Raider tailback 
on a key fourth-and-goal from the one-yard line early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 A big hit, but the Rams still suffered a big loss, 20-17, on Sunday at Anaheim 
Stadium. And after the game, Conlan was far from a celebratory mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Not after the Rams gave up 303 yards total offense and watched their playoff 
hopes slip away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be elated (about the hit on Williams) if we had won the game," Conlan 
said. "But if we don't win the game, it doesn't mean. . . . If we would have 
come back and won, it might have meant something." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Rams are 4-6 overall and 0-2 so far against the three other 
California teams. 
</P>
<P>
 With road games at San Francisco (8-2) and San Diego (8-2) in the next two 
weeks, will the Rams go 0-for-California, then load the moving van headed for 
St. Louis? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to bounce back at San Francisco and smack them in the face and take 
our frustrations out on them," said Ram strong safety Marquez Pope, who 
finished second on the team in tackles with eight, seven solo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't do it in L.A. Our L.A. pass is revoked for right now, so we have 
to go up to San Francisco. After this, we're going to go take care of the Bay 
Area, then go take care of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not over with." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not over with is a theme Ram defensive tackle Sean Gilbert echoed when he 
called a players-only huddle on the sidelines early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had given up a 10-yard touchdown pass from Jeff Hostetler to Rocket 
Ismail that put the Raiders ahead, 14-7. The Raiders had rolled up 164 yards 
total offense in more than a quarter, which left Gilbert in an inspirational 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them we still had a lot of football to play, that's all," Gilbert 
said. "It wasn't anything I said, it was just everyone going out and asserting 
themselves and doing what they had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Some got the message. Some didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the second quarter, cornerback Daryl Henley intercepted a Hostetler 
pass at the Ram 45 and returned it 23 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Conlan delivered in the third quarter with the big hit on Williams, grabbing 
the leaping tailback by the waist and pile-driving him into the ground. 
Defensive end Gerald Robinson plowed into Hostetler early in the fourth 
quarter, knocking him out of the game with a toe injury. 
</P>
<P>
 But then there were typical Ram gaffes down the stretch, invoking 
not-too-distant memories of losses to Atlanta and Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Brown beat Robert Bailey for a 12-yard reception on a crucial 
third-and-five, keeping alive an early fourth-quarter drive that led to Jeff 
Jaeger's 44-yard field goal that gave the Raiders a 17-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Green Bay, where the Rams blew a 17-3 halftime lead? Remember the 
Rams shutting out Atlanta for three quarters, only to give up the game-winning 
touchdown to backup Bobby Hebert in the fourth quarter? 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Fred Stokes does. Stokes said that in both games, the Rams had a 
chance to turn their season around with victories, as they could have against 
the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory over Atlanta would have give them a 3-2 record. Beating Green Bay 
would have made them 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a broken record," Stokes said. "It's like, 'Here we go again, the 
Rams have a chance to go to .500 and, nope, we don't do it.' "

BETTIS GETS BATTERED ACCORDING TO PLAN; INTERCONFERENCE: RAM RUNNING BACK, 
CENTER OF RAIDER STRATEGY, IS HELD TO 13 YARDS ON 10 CARRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As far as the Raider defense was concerned, Jerome Bettis' final rushing 
statistics told the whole story of their 20-17 victory over the Rams on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis: 10 carries for 13 yards, including only two carries for two yards in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 feet 11, 250 pounds, Bettis started the game as the NFL's premier power 
back with 814 yards rushing and three touchdowns in nine games.  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' defensive game plan against the Rams was simple: Stop Bettis and 
they stop the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the game, I told (defensive tackle) Chester McGlockton to go out there 
and get a couple of sacks," Raider Coach Art Shell said. "But he said, 'Forget 
about sacks. We have to go out there and stop that big back today.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders set the tone early against Bettis on the Rams' first possession. 
On first down, Bettis was stopped by linebacker Winston Moss for a one-yard 
gain over left guard. Three plays later, Bettis lost five yards when he was 
tackled in the backfield by McGlockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Things did not get any better for Bettis on the Rams' next possession; he 
carried on first and second downs for a combined three yards. When the first 
quarter ended, Bettis had four carries for minus-one yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get after him early and that's what we did," Moss said. "Once we 
stopped (Bettis), that forced them into a lot of third-down passing 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
 One Raider who was happy to see the game plan succeed was defensive end 
Alberto White. 
</P>
<P>
 White, who was placed on the active roster last week after spending the first 
half of the season on the practice squad, is the Raiders' pass-rush specialist. 
With Bettis and the Ram running game slowed, White played more downs than he 
expected in the first half and responded with a key sack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we were doing the job up front because I was getting used a lot in 
passing situations," White said. "It felt good to finally have the opportunity 
to get in there and make some plays." 
</P>
<P>
 By the second quarter, it was clear that the Raiders were determined primarily 
to stop Bettis -- a strategy that appeared shaky once Ram quarterback Chris 
Chandler started finding open receivers in the Raider secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler gave the Raiders fits as he completed 10 of his first 11 passes for 
171 yards, including a 22-yard touchdown pass to Flipper Anderson late in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problem was that were not getting enough pressure on the quarterback on 
their play-action plays," said defensive tackle Jerry Ball. "He had too much 
time to look for people." 
</P>
<P>
 That was until the Raiders' defensive front took matters into its own hands 
midway through the second quarter. On second and seven from the Raider 15, 
Chandler suffered an ankle injury when he was sacked high by Nolan Harrison and 
low by McGlockton. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started throwing the football, those big guys up the middle got a lot 
of push inside," Chandler said. "We just had a hard time getting them out of 
the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 With Bettis bottled up and a red-hot Chandler out of the game, the Raiders 
were able to cover up for their own injury-riddled secondary, which opened the 
game without starters Albert Lewis and Derrick Hoskins before losing Lionel 
Washington, who suffered a knee injury in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the second half, the Raiders were an injury away from 
using first-year safety Cary Brabham, who was activated Saturday after being 
waived twice the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way guys were going down for us, I thought that I might have to sneak on 
a uniform and limp out there," said Lewis, who was deactivated because of a 
knee injury he suffered last week against the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Rams rallied in the fourth quarter to cut the Raiders' lead to 17-10, 
it was only fitting that Raider cornerback Terry McDaniel made the key 
interception to set up Jeff Jaeger's game-clinching 47-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We forced them away from what they do best," Ball said. "Getting (Ram Coach) 
Chuck (Knox) to start throwing the ball was good for us."

HOLLYWOOD PARK; AFTERNOON DEELITES BACHARACH, MANDELLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Owner Burt Bacharach and trainer Richard Mandella are trying not to get too 
excited too early about Afternoon Deelites. But by their actions, their cover 
has been blown. Bacharach performed a concert Saturday night in Toledo, Ohio, 
then rushed back to Los Angeles, not wanting to miss his 2-year-old colt's 
second race. And after that race, Mandella was standing in the winner's circle, 
wearing a broad smile. 
</P>
<P>
 After running six furlongs in a sprightly 1:08 4/5 at Santa Anita on Oct. 23, 
Afternoon Deelites came back Sunday in the $95,250 Hollywood Prevue Breeders' 
Cup and won by three lengths with virtually no encouragement from jockey Kent 
Desormeaux. His seven-furlong time of 1:20 4/5 broke the stakes record by a 
fifth of a second and came within two-fifths of the track record, which was set 
by the 7-year-old Memo, another Mandella trainee, in the Triple Bend Handicap 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
 With two scratches, there were only three horses for Afternoon Deelites to 
beat, and he left them with an electrifying burst of speed at the top of the 
stretch. Valid Wager, the 13-10 favorite who had been second in the 
Arlington-Washington Futurity, finished second, four lengths ahead of Hunt for 
Missouri. Southern Tempo, the leader after a half-mile, was last, beaten by 18 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "That horse that won accelerated like no other 2-year-old I've seen this 
year," said Chris McCarron, who rode Hunt for Missouri. "He accelerated like 
maybe Mandella was running a 4-year-old against us. Maybe they ought to check 
this one's lip tattoo." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Soul of the Matter, Afternoon Deelites is a West Virginia-bred and a son 
of Private Terms. Bacharach said that Afternoon Deelites' dam, Intimate Girl, 
was injured and retired after running only one race. 
</P>
<P>
 Soul of the Matter, this year's Super Derby winner, was fifth in the Kentucky 
Derby and fourth in the Breeders' Cup Classic. "This colt's a lot like Soul of 
the Matter," Mandella said. "He's athletic, and light on his feet. I'm not 
surprised he won, but I am surprised at that time, because the colts he ran 
against have shown that they have some class." 
</P>
<P>
 Desormeaux knew that only one tap with the whip was going to be enough. "I was 
shocked at the turn of foot that he showed," the jockey said. "I'm in as much 
awe as everyone in the grandstand. He set the track on fire, for sure. When I 
cut him loose, I knew it was going to be very tough for anybody to be around 
him the way he accelerated. Then I just geared him down. We'll save him for the 
next time. It was breath-taking to be on his back. I've ridden a lot of horses, 
and this one took my breath away." 
</P>
<P>
 The only frame of reference Mandella can make among his previous 2-year-olds 
is Phone Chatter, last year's champion juvenile filly. "Since the day we got 
this horse, we knew he could run," Mandella said. "He just looked like a 
runner, and he's going right up the ladder." 
</P>
<P>
 Riding Valid Wager, Martin Pedroza thought his horse still had a chance at the 
head of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling you, my horse was running," Pedroza said, "and that other one 
made me feel like I was sitting still. When the winner went by me, I couldn't 
believe it. I'm not depressed after losing to a horse like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Afternoon Deelites, paying $5 as the second choice, is headed for the $500,000 
Hollywood Futurity, at 1 1/16 miles, on Dec. 18. With a slight license taken 
for the spelling, the name is derived from a hit pop song from a number of 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "But not one that I wrote," Bacharach said. "That's something, isn't it? To 
come up with a horse like this, and he's named after somebody else's song."

GOLF ROUNDUP; COUPLES, LOVE CONTINUE REIGN OVER WORLD CUP FOR THIRD YEAR

<P>
 The U.S. team of Fred Couples and Davis Love set a tournament record by 
winning the World Cup of Golf for the third consecutive time Sunday at Dorado, 
Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 Their victory broke a mark set twice over a five-year period by Jack Nicklaus 
and Arnold Palmer, winners for the United States in 1963-64 and 1966-67. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-stroke winning margin equaled a record set by Ben Hogan and Sam Snead 
in 1956 and the four-round total of 40 under par at the Hyatt Dorado Beach East 
Course also set a tournament record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having our names up there with Nicklaus and Palmer is something special," 
said Couples, after shooting a 69, his fourth sub-70 round of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples' 72-hole score of 265, 23 under, earned him his first World Cup 
individual title, an additional $100,000 and another tournament record. He 
finished second to Bernhard Langer last year and third to Brett Ogle in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Love will share $300,000 for winning the team competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty and Tony Johnstone, who began the day nine strokes 
behind the Americans, didn't mount a run Sunday, playing themselves out of 
contention by the turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples and Love coasted from there.

 Ray Floyd came from six shots back in regulation play, then beat Jim Albus in 
the fifth extra hole in the season-ending Senior Tour Championship at Myrtle 
Beach, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd rolled in his winner on a 15-foot downhill birdie putt on the 18th hole 
at the Dunes Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was worth $240,000 and lifted Floyd into second place on the final 
money-winning list at $1,382,762.

GROBBELAAR'S RETURN ENDS IN NEAR RIOT

 Goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar made a tumultuous return to the playing field 
Sunday when he helped Zimbabwe defeat Zaire, 2-1, in an African Nations Cup 
qualifying match that ended with Zaire players attacking the referee. 
</P>
<P>
 Grobbelaar is under investigation in England after being accused by a tabloid 
of accepting bribes to throw matches in the Premier League.He has filed a libel 
suit against the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists who had been trailing him were kept at bay by baton-wielding riot 
police, who had to rescue referee Christian Chikuka of Zambia after he awarded 
Zimbabwe a penalty kick in the 89th minute that resulted in the winning goal. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Zaire players, incensed by the call, chased Chikuka. The 
Zimbabwean team, with Grobbelaar in the forefront, came to the referee's rescue 
and punches were thrown until police with dogs intervened. Some Zaire players 
were reportedly bitten by the dogs.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH OPINION; ONLY 
THE SWIFT GET LUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REMIGIO SPARKS, For students, lunch is where you fill up on food and the 
latest gossip from friends before returning to the rigors of class. At 
Inglewood High School, the 1,800 students find themselves scrambling this fall 
after the school opted for a single lunch period in hopes of cutting truancy 
and making more staff available for supervision. Remigio Sparks, a football 
player and student newspaper editor, says the result is a chaotic situation. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 12:05 p.m. The teacher is discussing the night's assigned homework. But 
as the 12:17 p.m. lunch bell nears, the clicking of folders and the slamming of 
books drowns out her plea for "just one minute." Hungry students know that one 
fraction of a second could determine whether they eat or fast for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the bell is through sounding, the halls and school courts become an 
obstacle course only race-car sensation Mario Andretti could maneuver. Students 
weave around -- and sometimes through -- those who share the same mission: Hit 
the cafeteria line while it's short. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the swiftest, those who reach the cafeteria door are greeted with 
lines that remind them of rush-hour traffic after a 12-car pileup. They sigh 
and go for Plan B: Look for a friend in line who can sneak you in when the 
counselor on lunch duty isn't looking, or find someone related to the fry lady. 
If that fails, they're left with Plan C: Begging for food from someone else's 
plate, with pitches like "Come on, G." 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is forcing students to make a tough choice: Socialize or eat. 
Desperate times call for desperate actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the campus is closed -- meaning you have to have special 
permission to leave -- students find ways to visit the nearby Carl's Jr., 
McDonald's or Burger King, daring to be deprived of class time rather than of 
sustenance. Those who return to school on time can be seen sneaking a forbidden 
snack. And, oh look, the old sack lunch is back, but it's not preferred. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't be surprised if the single lunch period sets off a new wave of 
crime: fry jacking or pizza holdups. I think I even saw a burrito pusher the 
other day. His presence alone could trigger a mass of chili nacho drive-bys. 
</P>
<P>
 But couldn't these crimes be avoided with a little bit of reason? If one lunch 
must accommodate the entire student body, can't we at least have more than 34 
minutes? 
</P>
<P>
 Having to plan homework or class projects is one thing. But having to map out 
a plan to have a meal is too much to digest.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PROPOSITION 187; HOW 
HAS THE FUTURE CHANGED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The passage of Proposition 187, forbidding schooling and most health services 
to illegal immigrants and increasing penalties for false documentation, is by 
no means the end of the debate. Now come the lawsuits, the arguments over how 
or if it should be enforced, and speculation as to what it means to race 
relations in California. We asked activists, students, the educators and health 
professionals tasked with enforcing the measure, people who are here illegally 
and, not least, some ordinary voters selected at random to tell us their 
visions of the future, post-Proposition 187. The Enforcers

<P>
 Teaches government at Hamilton High School, West Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 I am hoping that the court challenges succeed. I have no intention of 
enforcing it in any way, shape or form. I cannot turn in any of my students. 
</P>
<P>
 I am worried about the divisiveness it has created on campus. There is a lot 
of tension between students of color. The kids who support it are saying things 
like "send them back." This initiative has led to an atmosphere of anger and 
mistrust. Kids are really mad.  
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't make any sense to me that people are saying this will send a 
message to the federal government. They say, "We don't want to pay for these 
undocumented immigrants," yet will be paying millions of dollars to finance the 
legal challenges (against the initiative). 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. BUFF CROSSLEY 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Division, LAPD 
</P>
<P>
 I think this initiative has already increased tensions. But it is a temporary 
thing. If people are law-abiding citizens, it won't affect them at all. As a 
policeman, I have no interest in enforcing immigration policies. It is 
counterproductive.  
</P>
<P>
 I was not surprised at all that it passed. People have come to the realization 
that it is a money issue. The people have made a statement that they want their 
borders controlled. We just cannot afford this anymore. It has nothing to do 
with race but rather with economics. 
</P>
<P>
 DOUG CROSSE 
</P>
<P>
 School board member, Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't a proponent of 187, although I see a real problem with the cost of 
social services and education for illegals. I do see some problems with the way 
the law is written, especially as it impacts schools and their function of 
acting as quasi-agents for the Immigration and Naturalization Service without 
compensation or a system to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as immediate impact, it's pretty obvious that there's going to have to 
be a whole lot of litigation. I think you'll probably see some protest, though 
in our district it probably will be mild.

care to people with no access to health care. A patient's immigration status is 
completely irrelevant to my relationship with them, to managing the medical 
problem. This initiative violates a doctor's ethic of confidentiality.  
</P>
<P>
 If we are forced to implement this, it is going to mean that a lot of women go 
without prenatal care. They will be afraid to go to the hospital for 
deliveries. Chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension are easily treated 
and relatively inexpensive if treated in an ongoing fashion, but not if 
complications develop.

 I understand that the Governor has requested the Department of Health Services 
and the Emergency Medical Services division to submit specific criteria to the 
hospitals in terms of how to handle this situation. There's probably going to 
be a large, new layer of bureaucracy to carry out the 187 mandate. For 
hospitals and schools to be doing immigration work is really inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard enough just delivering care let alone another administrative 
assessment making sure that the documentation we receive from the patients is 
legitimate.

 Where the county, state and city fall short in providing care, Catholic 
hospitals have a mission. We will continue to take care of those patients that 
are in need no matter what their race, color, creed or residence. The Affected

 My mom, my dad and my baby brother are illegal. My parents came to the United

brother was born there.  
</P>
<P>
 My dad trims trees and my mom is a housekeeper. My parents came to the United 
States because they wanted a good education for us. They told us they didn't 
want us to be raised like donkeys. They want us to get a good job, so you can 
raise your family better. 
</P>
<P>
 What bothers me the most is that they always pick on Mexicans instead of other 
people. It hurt me really bad since I'm Mexican. I guess it's because they 
think we're different but we're not. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents said a couple of times at dinner that we might have to move. I 
don't want to leave my friends. I'm afraid that we will have to move to Mexico 
and I won't be able to go to college or get a good education.

 This proposition is not in the best interest of anybody. I think tensions will

 The practical result will be that far fewer illegals will now come to 
California to work or for public benefits, knowing they're going to be denied. 
Employers are going to have to pay minimum wage or they're not going to get 
anyone to do those jobs. That may cut their profits but it certainly will save 
every one of us in tax dollars.

 187 was a wake-up call to Washington about unfunded federal mandates. As a 
city official, I can tell you unfunded federal mandates are the bane of local 
governments in every state in the nation. We have now elected a new Congress 
that will put an end to some of these laws without funding and Washington will 
respond to the Immigration and Naturalization Service underfunding so we'll 
have decent border control. They will deport illegals -- especially criminals. 
And we're going to see federal legislation that will reinforce and parallel 
187.

 The immediate result will be implementation of the initiative regarding 
(tougher penalties for) false documents. It's not likely that will be 
challenged. So parts of the initiative will move forward. People in the 
Legislature will know that we're serious about taking action and getting this 
problem resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term fallout, I suppose, is that a lot of people around the world 
trying to get to this country are going to have to stop and think twice before 
they decide to move north -- or east or west or even south. They even advertise 
in places like China and Hong Kong that you can come to this country and 
collect social welfare.

 The short-term answer is that it's going to let all of America know that we 
are going to have to deal with our borders. It is not only the wide-open border 
coming in from Mexico; it is also the Pacific Rim coming by air and boat and 
people coming in from Western Europe. In the long term, this will bring us into 
the real world. A lot of people would like to make it so that there is no 
distinction between the rights of a citizen and the rights of an illegal 
immigrant. If the resources begin to run thin, we can't afford it.  
</P>
<P>
 We have had a very biased immigration policy. When Cubans were coming over, 
there was always a welcome mat for them. But when Haitians started coming over, 
it was necessary to send the Marines to Haiti. As far as the African continent 
is concerned, there's basically no immigration policy that would allow blacks 
to come. So by excluding blacks and opening the door wide for Hispanics it was 
in itself an exclusionary policy. 
</P>
<P>
 I think this will be a much better country when we control our borders in a 
better fashion. We have already agreed to assist Mexico by opening up the 
border for economic development, which should help. The Opponents

 El Rescate has provided social and legal services for the past 13 years,

were suffering, came here, worked very hard. They've been paying taxes. A lot 
are just on the verge of becoming residents. Now they're being told, again, 
that there's no place for them. 
</P>
<P>
 We're hoping the legal challenges will put a stop to this. And we're very 
hopeful that sooner or later it will be proved unconstitutional. If it's not, 
racism and hatred is going to be pervasive not just in Southern California, not 
just in California, but across the country. And it's also going to create an

 One thing that frightens me tremendously is the idea of an identity card. As a 
Jew, I have a lot of trouble (with that) because identity cards have 
traditionally been used to single Jews out for discrimination in Nazi Germany 
and the Soviet Union. There's something really divisive having everyone with an 
identity card. 
</P>

 Gov. Wilson said this is not about race, not about hate. I think he's going to 
have to work very hard to prove that that's not the case, to make sure that 
that does not become the case.

 There are two levels to the short-term problems created by the approval of 
Proposition 187. On the one hand, we have an injunction thanks to Mexican 
American Legal Defense and other organizations that will prevent implementation 
on the official level. But on the unofficial level, clearly this will give 
license to people or businesses or entities that are inclined to discriminate 
against immigrant-looking people.  
</P>
<P>
 In the long term, scapegoating forces are going to seek to replicate 
Proposition 187 in other states. We can expect to see something in Congress and 
that means that this issue is not over. I can only see this as a really 
negative consequence. On the Street

 The one big practical effect on me is that I will work a lot more now. I can't 
compete with guys who are willing to work for below minimum wages. These 
illegals were taking food out of my mouth. I can feel for their problems. I 
think if I was in their shoes, I'd probably be doing the same thing. But 
unfortunately, I have to think about myself. 
</P>
<P>
 When I voted for Proposition 187, it was mainly to save my job. I don't want 
to see kids taken out schools or be denied medical attention. But what else was 
there? I know there is a lot of anger and mistrust on both sides, but it was at 
the point where the problem was way out of hand. Hopefully, California will get 
more attention from Washington now, and we can take care of this immigration 
problem from the source.

and are responsible for all that's evil in the world? 
</P>
<P>
 I guess government will look more closely at the immigration problem, which I 
think does exist. And with a Republican Congress and Senate, there will be no 
doubt that immigration will be on the front burner. Whether we pursue Nazi 
tactics or truly look for responsible ways to handle the immigration problem 
remains to be seen.

 In the short term, the lawyers are going to get paid. I don't see them taking 
children out of school or denying access to hospitals immediately. We'll 
probably have to wait for a Supreme Court decision before any of those steps 
are taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Long term, it's going to mean more jobs for Americans. That will mean we 
actually start enforcing the existing law, cracking down on employers. If you 
have a minimum wage law you should not be able to hire a non-American for less 
and put an American out of work. 
</P>

 I want to see peace in the streets. I have nothing against legal immigration, 
just illegal immigration. It has to be legal immigration so we can regulate the 
flow. The country shouldn't suffer because of it.

 Speaking for myself, not the association, I did want Proposition 187 to pass 
because we needed some kind of action on illegal immigration. By passing it, 
we're letting people know that California is not for illegal immigration. It is 
for legal immigration. I'm not saying that 187 is the answer to the problems 
that we're facing. I really doubt that anybody could enforce 187. How could we 
not let children go to school or reject them for medical care or city services? 
In that sense, I doubt that this law will be implemented.

 I am an American, born and raised here. But since this proposition has passed, 
I feel ashamed and angry. How can any good come out of this? It's not going to 
stop the illegal immigration. People are not coming to America because they 
want to be Americans. They are coming here out of desperation. They are looking 
for work and ways to feed their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who voted for Proposition 187 don't realize the message they are 
sending. One of the reasons Hitler came to power was because he fed off 
people's fear. I really don't think this is any different. Mexican bashing is 
the vogue now. I'm sure the federal government will do what is popular.

 I think Proposition 187 will really help the crime problem a lot. Crime is 
really a big problem and I think a lot has to do with the immigration problem.  
</P>
<P>
 If Mexicans are in this country illegally, taking advantage of us, then I 
don't have any respect for them. When I saw those kids protesting on TV 
carrying a Mexican flag, I'm sorry, I have no sympathy for that. If they hate 
it so much, go back to Mexico. If you want to be part of this country, then do 
it legally. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that now California will start getting some attention from Clinton. He 
has no idea what it's like. We need to start getting tough on the border.

 I don't think enough people went out and voted. They went out and protested 
but they could have taken that energy and gone going door to door to get out 
the vote and registering voters. 
</P>

 I don't think it's wrong to show pride by waving Mexican flags (at protests) 
but students have to realize that if they want to get something done, they need 
to go through the system.

FOR SCHOOL KIDS, THE FUTURE IS NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when voters are preoccupied with controlling crime and illegal 
immigration, Delaine Eastin knows that the real future of California lies in 
improving education. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin, elected Tuesday as California's first woman superintendent of public 
instruction, is one of just two Democratic statewide officers.She faces a tough 
challenge, not only in working with a Republican governor and, possibly, a 
GOP-dominated Assembly but also in making headway on educational reform as the 
state remains in the budgetary straitjacket imposed by the economic recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Demographic trends suggest that California public schools will see 30% growth 
in total enrollments over the next decade. Most of those new students are 
already born or, analysts at RAND predict, will be born to people who already 
live in California. As a result, RAND researchers argue, even stopping illegal 
immigration completely would have little effect on this massive growth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of this and other problems that could be daunting, Eastin offers 
sensible goals. She agrees with Gov. Pete Wilson on the need to eliminate 
campus violence and on improving classroom technology. With the innovative but 
controversial California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) test of student 
achievement unfortunately shelved by Wilson, Eastin wants to work toward 
implementation of another way to properly evaluate student performance. Such a 
statewide instrument is sorely needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin also promises to be an advocate for California's youngsters in the 
surely bruising budget battles to come. We wish her success. Much depends on 
it.

A GAIN AGAINST AIDS THAT CARRIES ETHICAL QUESTIONS; SHOULD HIV-POSITIVE 
PREGNANT WOMEN FACE MANDATORY AZT THERAPY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A rare piece of good news from the AIDS front poses difficult ethical 
questions: Should pregnant women be compelled to take the test for the virus 
that causes AIDS and then, if they test positive, be required to undergo AZT 
drug therapy to help save their unborn children from the disease? After all, 
pregnant women must be tested for syphilis; why not for the far deadlier AIDS? 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, there was no reliable means of preventing the transmission of the 
virus to the child. But a new study, cited by President Clinton Thursday in 
naming Patricia S. Fleming as the new AIDS czar, has shown that aggressive 
intervention to treat both the pregnant woman and the newborn with antiviral 
AZT can dramatically reduce the infant's chances of acquiring the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson is clear: Doctors should urge all pregnant women to take the HIV 
test and then draw into treatment those who carry the virus. However, any 
attempt to make either the test or treatment mandatory at this time would be 
counterproductive, probably deterring poor women from seeking perinatal care. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study found that maternal transmission to newborns can be cut by 
two-thirds if infected women are given AZT during pregnancy and delivery and 
the infants themselves are continued on AZT for six weeks. The researchers took 
the unusual step of ending the experiment early to publish the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 While encouraging, the findings have caused unease. The prevailing law and 
ethics of medicine today dictate that no one can be subjected to tests or 
therapy without informed consent. In California, even rapists cannot be forced 
to take AIDS tests; how could pregnant women be? 
</P>
<P>
 The new study shakes those principles of privacy and confidentiality, for the 
treatment benefits not the mother but her child, who to avoid AIDS surely would 
consent if he or she could. Last year in New York, an uproar ensued over 
demands for mandatory HIV testing of newborns because that would violate the 
privacy of the mother. The new study sharpens the issue in that it offers not 
just treatment but a means of preventing the disease altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The study -- which involved 44 research hospitals in the United States and 
France, including those of UCLA and USC -- does have limits. It says nothing 
about the possible long-term negative side effects of AZT or whether the method 
is effective when mothers have full-blown AIDS. Nonetheless, the U.S. Public 
Health Service is expected soon to urge doctors to offer HIV tests to all 
pregnant women and then counsel AZT therapy for those who test positive. Only 
1,000 to 2,000 babies are born with HIV yearly in the United States, or less 
than .05% of all births. But the number is growing, and in Los Angeles one of 
every 1,000 pregnant women has HIV, one in 160 among African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 For now we agree that mandatory testing is not needed. But it may be, should 
the numbers multiply. The tougher question is whether infected women should be 
compelled to take therapy to save their children. After all, it is estimated 
that it costs from $35,000 to $75,000 a year in hospital fees to treat a child 
with AIDS but only about $3,000 to apply the AZT therapy likely to prevent the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 It would not be legal to compel treatment now, nor advisable. We have come a 
long way since the Supreme Court authorized states to sterilize retarded people 
involuntarily. How could a woman be made to take five doses of AZT a day unless 
she were jailed or forcibly hospitalized? The larger public benefits if 
authorities ensure privacy and confidentiality, rather than drive people out of 
the health system with coercion. 
</P>
<P>
 Most HIV-infected women are poor, women who normally get little or no 
perinatal care. The challenge here is to reach out to them and present them 
with the best alternatives. Doctors at UCLA say such women mostly are quite 
willing to undergo AZT therapy for their infants when informed of the potential 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 A breakthrough has been achieved, one that promises to interrupt the spread of 
AIDS. With 1 million children infected worldwide, no speedy progress will be 
made in underdeveloped countries. But a good start has been made. New Hope on 
AIDS 
</P>

 Probability of HIV infected women transmitting to their infants.

DON'T TURN BACK NOW; GUN-CONTROL GAINS MUST NOT BE ERASED BY THE POLITICAL 
SHIFT ON CAPITOL HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who believe that controls on certain classes of deadly firearms have 
made a substantial contribution to public safety are in for a difficult period. 
Even before last Tuesday's Republican landslide, GOP leaders were vowing to 
push federal legislation to emasculate landmark gun laws including the Brady 
bill -- the national five-day waiting period for handgun purchasers -- and the 
new ban on assault weapons. Now, with the GOP controlling the House and the 
Senate, the enemies of sensible gun controls are in a position to make good on 
their threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Rifle Assn. boasts it defeated 19 of 24 targeted candidates. 
Clearly it packs political muscle that could help shift congressional 
deliberations away from reasonable gun control to so-called "crime control." 
Whether such a strategy prevails will depend in large part on lawmakers having 
the courage to hold fast in the face of a blitzkrieg of lobbying. President 
Clinton, too, must stand firm, and he must be willing to use the veto when it 
is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Employing the veto would not boost Clinton's popularity in some quarters; it 
would be especially hard to kill pro-gun measures if they were camouflaged 
within anti-crime bills. Over the next two years this situation surely will 
pose a major test of the President's promise of last week to stand on 
principle. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Capitol Hill lawmakers owe an obligation to those victims on the 
ever-expanding list of gun fatalities. Not just the five children slaughtered 
at a Stockton, Calif., elementary school in 1989; not just the eight people 
methodically gunned down in 1993 in a San Francisco law office. These are the 
cases one cannot forget. Rather it is the numbing string of routine gun deaths 
-- the senseless, daily losses that mount into the tens of thousands -- that 
demands political courage and a national response.  
</P>
<P>
 Many rational Americans have struggled for more than a quarter of a century to 
stem the unmitigated flow of the most dangerous firearms, such as assault 
weapons. Most agree now that such weapons ought to be banned. Congress finally 
summoned the nerve this year to listen to the calls for sanity and to fight the 
gun lobby. With that kind of progress having been made, why turn back now?

PASSAGE OF PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I cannot believe that Prop. 187 passed. To what depths will we descend to find 
a scapegoat for the problems of our economy? It only leads me to ask, what is 
next? How about concentration camps for all illegal aliens, and secret police 
to rout out all who are undesirable. Do all of you think that this is the 
"final solution" to the immigrant problem in this state?

 The people of California have overwhelmingly approved Prop. 187. It is time 
for the "no on 187" citizens to accept reality, initiate the will of the people 
and join forces to make 187 work. To complete what 187 started, our borders 
must be secure, illegal aliens immediately deported, and the process for legal 
immigration streamlined, organized and made fair and available equally to all 
people of all nations. Politicians who still oppose 187 will have short 
political careers. Organizations that mount legal battles will only increase 
the cost to the taxpayers that approved this measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Unconstitutional? If anti-187 people were concerned about the law of the land, 
then they should define illegal immigration. Racist and anti-Latino? What about 
claiming illegal acts as justifiable if they are committed by "their own," and 
for "their own cause"? Have they forgotten about the people of the rest of the 
world that would also like to immigrate to the United States, but don't have 
the geographical advantage that the people of Mexico are exploiting?

 There is a saying that out of every bad comes a good. Prop. 187 was bad from 
the beginning. It promoted so much division and ethnic hate -- our state did 
not need this. 
</P>
<P>
 But my hope is that the passing of this proposition will be a wake-up call to 
all who were eligible to vote and didn't. Your vote counted last Tuesday and 
you were too lazy. My hope is that all the students who demonstrated will take 
the voting privilege seriously and when eligible, get involved and vote. 
Expressing and voicing your opinion doesn't stop in the street -- you must 
voice it in the voting booth. Don't be discouraged and remember, there will be 
more elections. Be ready and "demonstrate" by exercising your voting privilege.

 I laughed aloud this morning when I read your exit poll story (Nov. 9). To 
hear The Times tell it, only a minority of voters elected Pete Wilson and 
passed Prop. 187. Perhaps you're in denial, so I'll help you out. This is a 
democracy, and the people have spoken. The voters run this country, not the 
media. Therefore, why don't you stop propagandizing, and start reporting 
objectively.

 Re "They Kept Coming," On California, by Peter H. King, Nov. 9:

 Yes, Mr. King, they kept coming -- and that is the problem precisely. They

who are here legally.

 Last Wednesday, in all seriousness, my neighbor at our industrial complex 
asked, "What are you going to do for employees now that 187 has passed?" It 
took me a minute to comprehend his meaning, since he has never spoken with any 
of my employees, except for my foreman, who has a decided Mexican accent. My 
foreman, who has worked for me for 17 years, has been a legal resident for over 
20 years. My other five employees are legal immigrants or U.S. citizens, but 
because they are of Mexican heritage, my neighbor thinks they are illegal. Such 
will be the case for brown-skinned people in California -- they will all be 
suspect. Germany had Jews for scapegoats. California has Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 As an employer I must verify documentation before hiring an applicant. In all 
my 17 years of employing people and examining documentation, I have only once 
seen identification that appeared to be phony. It was a Social Security card 
with a typed number on it. I told the applicant that the card was no good. He 
replied, "That is what the lady at the window gave me," and he proceeded to 
show me more paperwork from the Compton SSA office. The government forces 
employers to be detectives and quasi-immigration officers. Prop. 187 passes 
that unpleasant task to teachers and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sad day when anger and fear make people vote for something bad in 
order to send a message. I just hope Californians haven't cut off their noses 
to spite their faces.

 Once again the California voters have exercised their democratic right -- 
one-person, one-vote. The result has been an overwhelming and resounding "yes" 
on Prop. 187. And once again the state and federal courts are intent on 
nullifying the majority rule. What's going on here? The people have spoken. 
Illegal means "unlawful." Don't people get it?  
</P>
<P>
 The opponents of Prop. 187 have made this a racial issue. Their doctors, 
attorneys and educators are making big money off of illegal immigrants at the 
expense of the California taxpayer. I operated a polling booth on Election Day. 
It was quite refreshing to see new citizens (Russians, Hispanics, Africans) 
voting for the first time. To give illegals a safe, comfortable haven here is a 
slap in the face to all of the new citizens who have paid the price to go 
through the legal immigration system.

 There are many economic reasonings attached to Prop. 187 and now that it has 
been approved, the residents of California must abide with one of the messages 
it has sent to illegal immigrant workers: Raise your rates. 
</P>
<P>
 All maids, gardeners, nannies and other laborers who are working at or below 
minimum wage and without any employment-related benefits should charge their 
lawbreaking employers the kind of compensation that legal residents and 
citizens would demand for the same work. After all, the way to afford private 
health and education services is by earning income levels that can bear the 
expenses. Are Californians ready for the other side of the coin?

 They'll still let me pay my rent. They'll let me pay my taxes. They'll cut off 
social services that I never used in seven years and didn't even know about.

 I don't know if they will let me give my blood anymore. I go every two months

 I'm trying very hard to understand. What is in her background that makes her 
think I was put on this Earth to work hard, strive to improve myself primarily 
at my own expense, just to provide the illegals with welfare and to provide 
free education to her and other students in their formative years so they can 
demonstrate by waving the flag of a foreign nation and carry signs criticizing 
the policy decision of taxpayers. Is it her religious leaders? Is it her 
liberal teachers? 
</P>
<P>
 If she has such pride in her parent nation, she should go there to collect her 
free education as well as all other welfare benefits that the California 
taxpayers are currently providing.

 In regards to Prop. 187, as an American, I am ashamed. My husband, who voted

the news photos of the demonstrations against it, showing dozens of Mexican 
flags.

 The Irish march and drink green beer on St. Patrick's Day. The Germans 
organize oompah bands and Oktoberfests. The Italians gave us pizza and pasta 
and Italian opera. Resurgent Native American cultures add vitality and color to 
American mainstream culture. Everybody fawns over the British royals when they 
visit. How is any of this different from the ties to a mother country that 
Hispanics cherish? 
</P>
<P>
 My children's ancestors did not come over on the Mayflower. Some came because 
of the potato famine in Ireland. Some came during the reign of Britain's Queen 
Victoria. Some came from the kaiser's Germany, before mustard gas floated over 
trenches hiding future relatives from France. And darned if some didn't meet 
the boat. At some time during this country's history, every single group that 
contributed to the makeup of my children was vilified by those already 
established, declared "idiots" or "drains on the public treasury" or simply 
"savage." 
</P>
<P>
 As a Christian, I am appalled at the ferocious lack of charity and 
understanding. Please show me an example when we, as individuals or as a state 
or as a country, have been impoverished by helping someone else!

 I believe commentators such as Gus Frias ("America Isn't Colored White," 
Commentary, Nov. 10) have got it all wrong, and they do the very people they 
support no great service. His reckless use of language referring to the 
proponents of Prop. 187 as "white Europeans" out against "dark-skinned . . . 
immigrants" and references to the "immoral . . . conspiracies of these confused 
(white) lunatics" serves no worthwhile purpose and is not reflected in the 
dialogue from Prop. 187 supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, scores of children will not be thrown out of school, nor will our 
neighborhoods be threatened by the diseased. Prop. 187 has, however, sent a 
message to the world that California can only welcome legal immigration because 
that is all that we can afford. I don't argue with Frias' concept of public 
education being a "God-given right," but until God starts paying for it, the 
California taxpayer must say, "Sorry."

PERSPECTIVE ON THE PACIFIC RIM; THE TWAIN MEET IN TWO SUMMITS; CLINTON CAN TALK 
DEMOCRACY FOR THE AMERICAS AND TRADE FOR ASIA, AND REACH SIMILAR GOALS IN BOTH 
AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD K. EMMERSON, Donald K. Emmerson is a visiting professor with the 
Asia/Pacific Research Center at Stanford University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This year is ending in a flurry of summits. Two of the most important will 
bring together the leaders of large chunks of the planet: the Pacific Rim and 
the Western Hemisphere. These meetings show the new importance of regionalism 
in a post-Cold War world, and they also pose a choice between U.S. policies to 
shape that world. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton is attending the 18-country Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) leaders meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, this week. Then, Dec. 
8-11 in Miami, he will host all of the 33 heads of government from North, 
Central and South America (except Cuba). 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings in Bogor and Miami call for sharply different approaches to 
regional cooperation. If it does what President Clinton wants it to, the Miami 
summit will celebrate the triumph of democracy in the Western Hemisphere and 
reaffirm the "virtuous spiral" implanted like a pacemaker in the ideological 
heart of his foreign policy: Development induces democracy, democracy promotes 
peace and peace permits more development. Good things go together. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bogor, democracy is not on the agenda. In the 80 pages of recommendations 
to the APEC summiteers written by U.S. policy economist Fred Bergsten and 
colleagues from around the Pacific Rim, the word democracy is not even 
mentioned. The report proposes instead that APEC leaders commit their countries 
to "free and open" trade and investment around and across the Pacific Basin by 
the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Clinton politicize APEC's agenda by championing the goals of democracy 
and respect for human rights, as he will in Miami? Should he make access to the 
vast American market conditional on Asia Pacific countries' taking steps toward 
meeting those political goals? 
</P>
<P>
 The case for yes seems persuasive. APEC members include a number of relatively 
authoritarian governments. The gerontocracy in Beijing continues to repress 
internal opposition and to threaten to cancel what little democracy British 
governor Chris Patten will have been able to institute in Hong Kong when that 
colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. Recently, police in Singapore 
interrogated an American academic about an article he had written about unnamed 
regimes in the region that "reveal considerable ingenuity in their methods of 
suppressing dissent." In doing so, the police illustrated the language they had 
been told to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially more embarrassing is the poor record on freedoms and rights 
compiled by Clinton's Indonesian host. In June, the Indonesian equivalents of 
Time and Newsweek were banned. In mid-October, moves were under way to prevent 
members of a new Independent Journalists Assn. from covering the APEC meetings. 
Outspoken Indonesian professors have been harassed or fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton should feel free to voice such concerns informally in private, 
bilateral meetings. But he should not do so multilaterally within the APEC 
framework. Miami rules are inappropriate in Bogor. The "E" in APEC stands for 
economic , not political. To play the role of public scold in Indonesia would 
pointlessly worsen America's already shaky relations with crucial trading 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bogor, Clinton will face the leaders of economies whose combined size more 
than triples that of his guests in Miami. The average annual rates of 
per-capita economic growth achieved by East Asia and Latin America in 1980-91 
were, respectively, 7.8% and -0.1%. Latin America has more than twice the 
external debt of East Asia. The Pacific Rim is too vibrant and vital a zone for 
U.S. trade and investment -- 2.6 million American jobs depend on exports to 
Asia -- to risk for the sake of scoring political points off leaders who 
already doubt America's commitment to economic cooperation. Those doubts have 
been increased by the inability or unwillingness of Congress to strengthen 
Clinton's economic hand in Bogor by approving the World Trade Organization, and 
they may be further heightened by the results of the elections last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between the strategies appropriate in Miami and Bogor is not an 
anomaly. It reflects the difference between two regions. Nor will Clinton be 
inconsistent if he chooses to talk economics in Indonesia and politics in 
Miami. According to his Administration's faith in the "virtuous spiral," by 
promoting the prosperity of the Pacific Rim -- and of the United States as a 
key player -- he will also help to diminish authoritarianism in East Asia.

HERDING THE HOMELESS IS AN UNJUST ANSWER; DOWNTOWN L.A: A FENCED CAMP WON'T 
ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM OR MAKE BUSINESS CLIMATE 'FRIENDLIER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL DEAR and JENNIFER WOLCH, Michael Dear and Jennifer Wolch, who teach 
at USC, are the authors of Malign Neglect (Jossey-Bass, 1993), about 
homelessness in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The homeless of Los Angeles had some good and bad news recently. The U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development offered a $20-million package to 
the city and county for homeless assistance programs. Shelter Partnership, a 
local advocacy group, and the City/County Los Angeles Homeless Service 
Authority devised a sensitive response emphasizing prevention, emergency 
response, transitional living arrangements and permanent support programs. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, so good. Now the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's office used these ideas to float a plan to spend 20% of the $20 
million on a drop-in center to be located in Skid Row. The Times described this 
center as a fenced-in urban campground "where up to 800 people could take 
showers and sleep on a lawn."  
</P>
<P>
 This is the worst idea to surface in Los Angeles since the city's previous 
ill-fated experiment with urban campgrounds in 1987. First of all, it's too 
big. The center would at best act as a holding tank; at worse, an outdoor 
detention camp. Very few people would actually be helped. 
</P>
<P>
 The center would become a flash point for criminal behavior, acting as a 
magnet for homeless people from communities where existing services have been 
closed or scaled down. It would inevitably be a prelude to crackdowns on 
street-dwellers outside the fences of the drop-in center. And no one in Central 
City East (the proposed location) would want it for a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus for the proposal appears to derive from Mayor Riordan's desire to 
make Downtown Los Angeles "friendlier to business." Well, we have news for the 
mayor. Downtown business won't pick up until California fights its way out of 
the recession, until procedures for permits and regulation are streamlined and 
until much-needed infrastructure improvements are completed (for instance, the 
Alameda rail corridor). The Downtown business climate has absolutely nothing to 
do with homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of working to materially improve Downtown's business environment, the 
mayor wants to join other governments in Southern California in their attempts 
to criminalize the behavior of homeless people. In Los Angeles, Santa Monica, 
West Hollywood and elsewhere, there is a mounting tidal wave of local 
ordinances against panhandling, feeding programs and public sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's office reportedly got the idea for the drop-in center from a 
similar experiment in San Diego. It's not clear why this trip was necessary, 
since we have lots of excellent home-grown ideas ready and waiting. Last year, 
the Community Redevelopment Agency spent several million dollars working out a 
new strategic plan for Downtown Los Angeles. This included sections on 
homelessness and social services. As part of the consultant team, we hammered 
out a detailed compromise between the interests of the homeless and other 
residents and businesses of Central City East. A large-scale urban encampment 
was not part of our agreed-upon solution. 
</P>
<P>
 What matters most in any plan to help the homeless are the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Small-scale human services hubs located in the communities of origin of 
homeless people (especially, for example, South-Central Los Angeles) to prevent 
the further drift of the homeless to Downtown's Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 * Effective, street-level outreach to put the newly homeless immediately in 
touch with helping agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Small-scale, self-governing outdoor living facilities in protected sites, 
where between 25 and 40 hard-to-reach homeless people can build self-help 
networks to assist them to return to the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 After the City Council voted unanimously to move ahead with the encampment, 
Deputy Mayor Rae James sought to assuage anxieties about the mayor's plan. But 
she did not back off the idea of a large-scale encampment, or look beyond 
Downtown for solutions to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Homeless Service Authority speaks of the need for a new "social contract" 
between government and homeless. But since the days of Hobbes, Locke and Jean 
Jacques Rousseau, social contracts have always involved a bilateral agreement 
between interested parties. A policy for herding the homeless into a massive 
campground can hardly be construed as the basis for a mutually respectful 
agreement. There will never be peace until there is justice in the rules 
governing debates about homelessness in Los Angeles.

PROP. 186'S DEFEAT NEED NOT END REFORM; HEALTH CARE: START WITH SMALLER DOSES 
LIKE CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE FOR ALL AND ENDING SOME STATE MANDATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL J. FELDSTEIN, Paul J. Feldstein is a professor and the FHP Foundation 
Distinguished Chair in health-care management at UC Irvine's Graduate School of 
Management. He is also chairman of the UCI Graduate School of Management's 
annual Health Care Forecast Conference. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Californians may believe that everyone should have comprehensive, 
cradle-to-grave health insurance coverage, but they aren't willing to pay for 
it. Nor are they willing to trust that government will do a better job of 
running the health-care sector than private industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters made that clear on Tuesday when they defeated Proposition 186, which 
would have established a single-payer health-care delivery system financed by 
the largest tax hike ever imposed in any state and managed by a vast state 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 As President Clinton learned when Congress began dismantling his mammoth 
health-reform plan, the American people are not ready for radical change. They 
want their health-care reform to come in smaller doses. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that California voters have rejected a plan to overhaul the state's entire 
health-care system, it's time to consider less drastic measures that would 
provide greater health security for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, the state Legislature should require all California 
residents to have catastrophic coverage, which those under age 50 can get for 
$400 to $700 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of California's 5 million uninsured are low- to middle-income working 
adults whose employers don't provide health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, only 28% of the uninsured are officially classified as poor. 
</P>
<P>
 An individual mandate requiring everyone to have minimal catastrophic coverage 
would substantially reduce the cost-shifting that occurs when the uninsured end 
up in hospital emergency rooms. Many of these people can afford a catastrophic 
policy; they shouldn't be getting a free ride at the expense of California 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The state should subsidize those who can't afford catastrophic coverage -- and 
could do so at a cost far less than that of providing the rich benefit packages 
for which some families are paying more than $6,000 a year. Of course, those 
who are poor should have better coverage so they won't have to wait for an 
emergency to get care. But a catastrophic policy would be better than nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 California also needs to make health insurance more affordable by eliminating 
the plethora of state mandates that drive up costs. These mandates, which don't 
apply to the large firms that are able to self-insure, have greatly expanded 
the kinds of services that must be covered, the types of providers eligible for 
payment and the categories of people eligible to receive benefits. Studies have 
shown that many small firms that don't offer health insurance would be able and 
willing to do so in a market free of mandates, many of which are enacted in 
response to pressure from special-interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the services that receive mandated coverage in California are alcoholism 
and drug-abuse treatment, mental-health care, orthotic/prosthetic care, 
diabetic education and acupuncture. These and other mandated services are 
certainly desirable. But they make health insurance so comprehensive that 
people with lower incomes can't afford it. We can't cover everything. We must 
start making tough choices if we want more people to have the security that 
health insurance provides. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to these two steps -- requiring catastrophic coverage and 
eliminating state mandates -- the Legislature should also enact 
health-insurance reform that would provide guaranteed renewability within 
standard rates and portability of insurance for all California residents. We 
should not have to be afraid of losing our insurance because of a job loss or 
change, or because we have incurred a large medical expense. 
</P>
<P>
 We could add much more to California's legislative agenda for health-care 
reform, but, as Proposition 186's defeat demonstrates, we would do so at the 
risk of ending up with nothing. Besides, there are many signs that the 
marketplace is succeeding where government has failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1981 and 1990, while per-capita health expenditures in the United 
States and Canada went up by 9.5% and 9.3%, respectively, California saw a 7.9% 
increase. In recent years, per-capita health spending in the state has been 
staying down, and health insurance rates have been dropping -- remarkable 
trends that can be largely attributed to the rapid growth of low-cost 
managed-care insurers and the intense competition in California's health-care 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time for a new perspective on health-care reform, one that acknowledges 
that there are limits to what we are willing to pay for, and doesn't expect 
government to provide all the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't have it all. But we can have a lot more than we do now if we stop 
looking at health-care reform as an all-or-nothing proposition.

 John Updike a geezer? Impossible. Only yesterday, it seems, he was a boy 
wonder fresh out of Harvard by way of the New Yorker, dazzling us with moves in 
prose as fluid as young Rabbit Angstrom's on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Rabbit is dead, after faking and dribbling his way through four novels, 
and I realize that I have been reading Updike, his creator, all my adult life. 
"Born in Shillington, Pa., in 1932" -- that standard biographical line has 
appeared in each of Updike's 40-plus books; now, in his 11th collection of 
short stories, it tells a tale of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Updike, in these 22 new stories (17 of them reprinted from the New Yorker), 
faces up to the inexorable arithmetic. Most of his protagonists, too, are in 
their 60s. Sex and death are still his preoccupations -- as they must be for a 
WASP male writer denied more specialized sources of material -- but the balance 
has clearly tilted toward death. 
</P>
<P>
 Sex is recalled like a delirium after the fever has passed. Updike's men try 
to remember the visions love brought to them, but the only solid evidence is 
the debris littering the sickbed: children, ex-wives, divided property, 
self-distrust, regret. Death, on the contrary, is close and real, though often 
oddly reassuring in its approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps an object could travel faster than the speed of light, and we each 
have an immortal soul. It didn't, terribly, matter," one character muses. "The 
headlines in the paper, trumpeting news of campaigns and pestilences, seemed 
directed at somebody else, like the new movies and television specials and 
pennant races and beer commercials -- somebody younger and more easily excited, 
somebody for whom the world still had weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Updike expresses this lightening, this shuffling-off of mortal avoirdupois, by 
revisiting places and people we have seen before. The town of Olinger; the city 
of Alton; a Massachusetts beach settlement like the Tarbox where "Couples" 
cavorted, now haunted by AIDS and outbreaks of tick-borne Lyme disease; above 
all, the 80 Pennsylvania acres where "The Centaur" and "Of the Farm" took place 
-- each is viewed from a new angle. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Sandstone Farmhouse," the longest story here, is a meditation on the 
transience of people, the mutability of places and the stubborn bonds between 
them. The aging narrator's aged mother dies -- a sign that he must follow. Yet 
her life seems more meaningful to him than it did before; the religious impulse 
to sum things up is incorrigible in Updike's characters, whether or not God, 
too, is keeping score. The mother's house in the country, which the son once 
was glad to escape, now "needed him. Only he understood it. . . . He had always 
wanted to be where the action was, and what action there was, it turned out, 
had been back there." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard and Joan Maple, long divorced and remarried, meet again to witness the 
birth of their first grandchild, and the erotic, contentious past they have 
shared crackles to life in the brush of their contact, like static electricity. 
Allen Dow, the mother-fixated teen-ager in Updike's 1962 story "Flight," is now 
hollowed out by his mother's absence. Fat and lonely at 60, he eats 
compulsively to still "the suppressed panic" inside him, "not so much the fear 
of death as the sensation that his life was too small. " 
</P>
<P>
 Dread appears elsewhere in this collection -- few stories express the horror 
of a comfortable but loveless old age better than "Short Easter." More typical, 
though, is the playful title story. The "afterlife" could be a couple's 
post-retirement idyll in England; it could be the heightened sense of life a 
visitor experiences after a near-fatal fall down a flight of stairs; but it 
could simply be old age itself, a release from the pressures and worries of 
overextended youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Are Updike's powers aging along with him? Not much. We have come to take his 
stylistic brilliance and structural ingenuity for granted, and some of his 
habitual gestures -- the Greek mythology, the swatches of travelogue, the cool, 
brittle encounters between lovers -- seem like tics. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the golf story here, "Farrell's Caddie," is a classic of its kind; and 
it's worth noting that Updike does his best work in "The Afterlife" not when he 
repeats himself, in the sexual comedies, but when he bravely surveys the 
narrowing new territory that the years have left him.

 Dear Street Smart: Traditionally, "big rig" trucks occupied the extreme 
right-hand ("slow") lane on the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in recent years it appears that these trucks have moved to the second 
lane from the right, effectively creating a second slow lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the change? 
</P>
<P>
 Peter C. Bronson, Tarzana 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: Blame it (as with everything else, it seems) on your elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a decade ago, state lawmakers amended the California Vehicle Code 
(Section 21655) to allow tractor-trailers to use the two right-hand lanes for 
travel on a highway with at least four lanes in one direction. 
</P>
<P>
 For highways with three or fewer lanes, the big rigs must stay in the far 
right lane and use the second right-hand lane only to pass, says California 
Highway Patrol spokesman Sgt. Ernie Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia doesn't remember why the Legislature made the change. But Larry Blood 
of the California Trucking Assn. in Sacramento says it was probably the result 
of pressure from the trucking industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be able to maneuver in two lanes on a four-lane highway is not 
unreasonable," Blood says. 
</P>
<P>
 And to hear him tell it, even two lanes aren't enough for some big-rig 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They always want more," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: What is the speed limit on unposted secondary roads, such 
as Angeles Forest Highway? I know it is either 50 or 55 m.p.h., but I have 
looked in two old drivers' handbooks from the California Department of Motor 
Vehicles and cannot find any mention of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, is there any standard for the smoothness of pavement after a repaving? A 
major portion of Big Tujunga Canyon Road north of Sunland, between Angeles 
Forest Highway and Mount Gleason Avenue, is being repaved. I had thought that 
workers were just putting down a rough intermediate layer of tar until the 
final stripes were painted on, but it has remained rough. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the roughest newly paved road I have ever driven on anywhere in the 
world, and I find it hard to believe that federal, state or even city standards 
would permit the contractor to do such a poor job. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Thomas Lawry, Tujunga 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: To tackle your second question first: 
</P>
<P>
 The county -- not the feds, the state or the city -- is in charge of that 
stretch of Big Tujunga Canyon Road, and not only do they permit the contractor 
to do such a poor job, they want it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike regular paving projects, where workers iron out a road that's become 
uneven, the reverse holds true here: Workers roughen a road that's worn smooth. 
The idea is to provide more tire traction along such a curvy mountain road. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what we call a slurry-seal project," says Donna Guyovich, a 
spokeswoman for the county Department of Public Works. "It's a process whereby 
chips of material are put into road-surfacing. Especially for mountain roads, 
this rough surface is specifically done to avoid slippage, to have better tire 
traction." 
</P>
<P>
 Eligible roads receive the slurry-seal treatment about once every five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Guyovich says that the project is almost complete along the 9.5-mile stretch 
of Big Tujunga Canyon Road from Angeles Forest Highway to the Los Angeles city 
boundary, just north of Mount Gleason Avenue. Only some cleanup and final 
striping remain. 
</P>
<P>
 As for your first question, CHP Officer Rhett Price informs us that you can 
zip along at speeds up to 55 m.p.h. on Angeles Forest Highway (which is also a 
county road). 
</P>
<P>
 But of course, the basic speed law -- drive only at the speed at which it is 
safe -- takes precedence.

CONCERNS LOOM FOR FANS OF PLANNED BALLPARK; POLICY: CITIES WILL VOTE ON VENTURA 
LOCATION FOR MINOR LEAGUE STADIUM. NEITHER TEAMWORK NOR RELIABLE FUNDING IS 
ASSURED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The issue looks beguilingly simple: Should a minor league baseball stadium be 
built on 35 acres in east Ventura? 
</P>
<P>
 But behind the question facing the Ventura, Oxnard and Camarillo city councils 
this week lie pressing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 With budgets tight in all three cities, leaders must decide where to find the 
money to pay the $15-million construction bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they can come up with the funds, Camarillo and Oxnard officials must 
swallow their parochial pride and agree to pay for a major tourist draw in 
someone else's city. Longstanding inter-city rivalries could topple the rare 
cooperative spirit of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city leaders already say they are reluctant to invest in a project 
outside their boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fine. That's Ventura's business," Camarillo Councilwoman Charlotte 
Craven said. "I'm not interested in putting any of Camarillo's money into it. I 
don't see any benefit to the city of Camarillo in this." 
</P>
<P>
 The drive to construct a stadium began in the spring when the president of the 
California League promised to deliver a Class A team to Ventura County if the 
cities built a ballpark for the team to play in. The three largest west county 
cities soon formed a committee and spent $85,000 to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the committee has picked a site -- a barren field near the Ventura 
Auto Center -- and proposed a funding mechanism, a joint powers authority. To 
be named the Tri-Cities Sports Authority, the joint project would own and 
operate the 5,500-seat stadium and share all costs and profits. The stadium 
would be slated for a spring, 1996, opening. 
</P>
<P>
 But concerns remain about how each city would be able to support its share of 
the sports authority and whether, once built, the stadium would even cover its 
operating costs, much less recoup the three cities' initial outlays. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest step in the process starts today, when Ventura becomes the first of 
the three cities to consider the site near the auto center. Votes will follow 
in Oxnard on Tuesday and Camarillo on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura City Council members say they doubt that this week's decision will 
prove a stumbling block for the seven-member board -- if they are going to 
shell out for a stadium, of course, they would prefer to have it in their own 
city. The matter will be the subject of a work session before tonight's council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The item is also expected to pass in Oxnard, where officials say they are not 
concerned about which city ultimately plays host to the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We entered into these discussions with an agreement that we would support the 
stadium in whatever city was chosen," Councilman Andres Herrera said. "I don't 
think we have a problem there." 
</P>
<P>
 But some Camarillo council members are balking at the prospect of forking over 
millions of dollars for a stadium two cities away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very interested in a minor league baseball team -- if it is in 
Camarillo," Councilman Mike Morgan said. "That would be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan pointed out that there is a site available in Camarillo, 25 acres of 
vacant land south of the Ventura Freeway near Camarillo Airport. A committee of 
staff and council members from the three cities evaluated that land along with 
three other parcels before deciding to rank it as the second-best ballpark 
site, just behind the Ventura location. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan believes that they made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have overcast weather in Ventura a lot of the time," he said. "If you're 
looking for success, why would you build this close to the ocean?" 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo has a better climate, is more centrally located and is far enough 
away from the Ventura County Fairgrounds that a stadium would not compete with 
it for concert bookings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to do something that's going to lose people's tax dollars," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sour grapes, Ventura Councilman Jim Monahan responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure I would feel the same way if I were him," Monahan said. "But we 
agreed to enter into this together, and I hope if Ventura had been the loser, 
we would still be a participant" in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 If one of the cities were to back away from the project, whether because of 
parochial rivalries or financial concerns, the stadium would quickly become a 
much less attractive proposition, city leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 "That makes it a different project," Ventura Councilman Gregory L. Carson 
said. "I'm more hesitant about doing this if someone drops out." 
</P>
<P>
 For each city, money is a major worry. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the present proposal, the new joint powers authority would issue bonds 
for construction. The cities would pay the interest for the long-term 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 There are funds available to pay off the bonds in Ventura, if the council 
chooses to use them. The city has $9.5 million that it raised nearly 10 years 
ago to pay for a convention center that was never built. 
</P>
<P>
 Many groups around town would claim those funds for their own pet projects -- 
a new library, a regional park, a marine educational and entertainment center 
or improvements to the city's downtown. But, ultimately, the money is to be 
used at the council's discretion, to spend or save as it sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members say a stadium seems like a viable option. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm coming around to it," Carson said. "I probably was originally pushing for 
the marine center. But, basically, I'm looking to see what is best for this 
city's tourism industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard, however, cannot fall back on a large savings account, and some council 
members say the city will need to locate private money to swing its share of 
the funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see some matching funds," Councilman Bedford Pinkard said, "but I don't 
see Oxnard putting up a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo officials say they can also ill afford to pay one-third of the 
construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the city thinks it has $5 million to spend on something, then let's talk 
about libraries or streets," Craven said. "Things like this should be done with 
private money." 
</P>
<P>
 It is comments like this that leave Ventura Councilman Gary Tuttle with 
worries -- lots of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "What questions do I have? Well, for one . . . what happens if we don't get a 
team out there?" Tuttle asked. "And Camarillo and Oxnard -- I'd like to see 
their vote first, before we take ours. I'd be real concerned if we put our 
money in and another city balks along the line and leaves us hanging. Oh, and 
how will the ongoing maintenance costs add to our General Fund expenses?" 
</P>
<P>
 He paused to take a breath. This is why even a simple vote like the one he 
faces today causes him concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how I can have an opinion," he said, "until I see the answer to 
these questions." 
</P>

D. A. TO SHIFT FOCUS IN MURDER TRIAL TO EVIDENCE; COURTS: AFTER TWO WEEKS OF 
TRYING TO ESTABLISH A MOTIVE IN THE DEATH OF A WESTLAKE NURSE, LAWYERS WILL 
PURSUE NEW TESTIMONY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The murder of Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan is the key issue in the 
death-penalty trial of Mark Scott Thornton, lawyers say. But in the first two 
weeks of the trial, they presented little testimony about his alleged link to 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning today, prosecutors say that will change. 
</P>
<P>
 Comfortable that a motive for the killing has been firmly established, 
prosecutors say they will now focus more on how O'Sullivan was murdered and who 
would have had reason to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 With no direct proof linking Thornton to the killing -- such as a witness -- 
prosecutors will try to use circumstantial evidence to convince the jury in 
Ventura County Superior Court that the 20-year-old defendant is guilty of 
first-degree murder and a special circumstance that could send him to the gas 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses this week are expected to tell the panel that Thornton frequently 
hung out near the murder scene and that the murder weapon was found in his 
possession. Jurors have already heard that Thornton was caught driving 
O'Sullivan's vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Erika Schroeder, a former girlfriend of Thornton's, is expected to take the 
witness stand today and testify that Thornton had a fascination with the Santa 
Monica Mountains, where O'Sullivan's body was found. 
</P>
<P>
 She will testify that the defendant once boasted about being able to hide a 
body there in a place where no one would ever find it, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Dougherty, a ballistics expert, is scheduled to tell the jury that the 
bullets used to kill the 33-year-old mother came from the same .38-caliber 
revolver taken from Thornton when he was arrested five days after the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dr. James Ribe, a coroner's official from Los Angeles, is expected to give 
testimony on the results of his autopsy -- showing that O'Sullivan died shortly 
after a motorist saw two people fitting the descriptions of O'Sullivan and 
Thornton traveling in the direction of the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement, Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris stressed the 
importance of circumstantial evidence to the jury because there are no 
witnesses to the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to this point, however, none of that evidence has been presented to the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution has spent much of its time trying to prove that Thornton had a 
motive to kill O'Sullivan. That motive: He needed her vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Thornton was a deeply bothered teen-ager during the time 
leading to the murder and decided to rob O'Sullivan of her sporty black 
Explorer so that he could leave the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses have testified that Thornton was homeless before the murder, 
having been kicked out of both his home and a room he was renting. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had also issued an arrest warrant after he violated his juvenile 
probation, which he had received for a car burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, his latest romantic fling was on the rocks, according to 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have used that backdrop to support their theory that the defendant 
was looking to steal a car and take off for Oregon, a state he viewed as both 
beautiful and much safer from possible police interest in locking him up. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during Thornton's hunt for a vehicle, prosecutors say, that he 
encountered O'Sullivan outside a Thousand Oaks pet store, on her way home after 
getting off work less than two hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have not said whether they believe that Thornton hid inside 
O'Sullivan's Ford Explorer and surprised her or if he confronted her outside 
it. Nor have they said whether the nurse was forced inside after leaving the 
pet store, where she had gone to pick up feed and a toy for her new bird. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have presented a witness who said she saw someone matching the 
defendant and the victim heading in the general direction of where O'Sullivan's 
body was found. 
</P>
<P>
 They have had another witness testify to hearing three rapid gunshots in the 
mountain canyon around the time the pathologist is expected to say that 
O'Sullivan was shot. That witness, Donna DesBaillets, lives about a quarter of 
a mile from where O'Sullivan's body was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very, very loud," said DesBaillets, adding that the shots scared her 
three dogs. "It just filled up the whole canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, prosecutors will try to prove that those were the shots that killed 
O'Sullivan and that only Thornton could have fired them. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys, who refute the prosecution's theory, say they will call 20 
witnesses to prove that their client is not guilty of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 They have neither conceded nor denied that Thornton was involved in the 
nurse's death. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear if Thornton will be one of the defense witnesses. When asked 
if her client will take the stand, Deputy Public Defender Susan R. Olson 
laughed and said, "No comment." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also still plan to put a number of police officers on the stand, 
but Kossoris would not say whether they would testify this week. The officers 
are from various agencies, including the Ventura County Sheriff's Department 
and the Reno Police Department. Thornton was arrested in Reno five days after 
O'Sullivan's death and gave officers there a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 After the prosecution witnesses testify, the jury will take a field trip to 
the pet store where O'Sullivan was last seen and the thick brush off Mulholland 
Drive where her body was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors have already had a glimpse of the murder site. Last week, prosecutors 
showed them a photograph taken of O'Sullivan's body 12 days after her 
disappearance, after searchers found it on Sept. 26, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton burst into tears when the picture was hung in front of the courtroom, 
Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see his eyes were getting red and his nose was getting red, and the 
next time I looked, tears were sliding down his cheek," said Olson, who quickly 
handed Thornton a tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trial has not always been so tense. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury broke into uproarious laughter Thursday when Margaret Spalding, the 
witness who saw the man and woman who looked like Thornton and O'Sullivan in a 
truck, was asked about her driving habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Spalding had told investigators that she drives her Mercedes 65 m.p.h. to 80 
m.p.h. on the Ventura Freeway. Defense attorney Howard J. Asher asked her about 
the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your honor, do I have to answer that?" Spalding asked the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 She then explained that she tries to "keep up with the traffic" unless she is 
in a hurry, prompting more laughter from the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher asked if this has ever caused her to be ticketed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not yet," she responded. "But I've got a feeling that I will be."

YOUNGSTERS LEAVE MARK ON SHORELINE; ENVIRONMENT: FIFTY OXNARD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
STUDENTS ADOPT OIL-DAMAGED MCGRATH STATE BEACH IN AN EFFORT TO RESTORE ITS 
NATURAL HABITAT.

 Sixth-grader Stephanie Ngo thinks that some adults are downright 
inconsiderate. 
</P>
<P>
 She says they do not seem to care for the planet's non-human species, because 
they leave their mark on the homes of thousands of birds, fish and insects on 
the once-unpolluted beaches of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't care about the Earth," Stephanie said last week as she picked up 
an empty cigarette package that was buried in the wet sand. "I don't think it's 
fair. They only think of themselves. They don't think about the other creatures 
around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie is one of 50 students from Emilie Ritchen School in Oxnard who have 
adopted McGrath State Beach. The students and their teachers plan to spend 
parts of the winter and spring restoring the natural habitat of the shore, 
which was heavily damaged during an oil spill at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of reading science books in the classroom, the fifth- and 
sixth-graders will spend one day every two weeks picking up trash, cutting 
unwanted weeds and replanting natural flora. 
</P>
<P>
 While they're doing that, they'll get to watch plant-eating birds such as the 
coot eating greens, and carnivorous birds such as the turkey vulture eating 
dead lizards, squirrels and snakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to give some real meaning to what kids learn," said Gene Figueroa, 
one of the two teachers involved in the project. "Being out here, they learn 
how to care for the environment and they become responsible human beings." 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa and the second teacher, Evelyn Ybarra-Grosfield, said they chose 
McGrath State Beach because it's near their school and because they want to 
help restore some of the ecological damage the area -- particularly McGrath 
Lake -- incurred during the oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
 At Christmas, at least 84,000 gallons of oil leaked from a Bush Oil Co. 
pipeline into the lake and the ocean. At the time, the area was home to two 
endangered species -- the California brown pelican and the snowy plover -- and 
a range of other waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the spill, state park rangers and environmentalists have been cleaning 
the area to make the wetlands safe again for the birds, including herons, 
sandpipers and ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the students learned, the environmentalists have a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is real sad," sixth-grader Laurena Guzar said as she compared the 
pinkish sand from the beach with the brown sand she collected near the lake. 
"The birds and other animals have had their homes ruined." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurena was taking the sand samples back to the classroom, where the students 
will study them. 
</P>
<P>
 During a two-mile morning walk on the southern part of the beach last week, 
the students began the six-month project by photographing the lake and its 
surroundings and taking notes on the plants affected by the oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
 They filled plastic bags with all sorts of litter found on the grayish dunes, 
including plastic, fiberglass, toothbrushes, bathing suits, soda bottles and 
cans, and such ocean debris as bird skulls. 
</P>
<P>
 As they reached the lake, state Park Ranger Thomas Hudson, who was guiding the 
group, pointed out a grebe, explaining that the migratory birds are just now 
returning to McGrath Lake after the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson said the students make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids do provide us with a lot of positive support," he said. "It's 
exciting to see children caring for the environment as these ones do." 
</P>
<P>
 As their tour of the area continued, the students made notes on all their 
findings so they can prepare an environment report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, Ybarra-Grosfield said, will be sent to ecologists at UC Santa 
Barbara for advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The report will include questions on how to increase the number of algae and 
brine shrimp in the lake, she said. Shrimp is one of the primary foods of the 
grebe and the egret, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-hour evaluation of McGrath State Beach ended with a picnic. Some 
youngsters were tired, some were hungry and others couldn't stop talking about 
coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to help the wildlife," 10-year-old Christina Little said. "I want to 
show that kids can make a difference."

STREET SMART: OXNARD STILL PLANNING TO PAVE GONZALES ROAD NEAR MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 When is something going to be done about the rough, poorly striped condition 
of the intersection of Gonzales Road and Rose Avenue in Oxnard? 
</P>
<P>
 I can't believe whoever worked on this intersection, near the Shopping at the 
Rose complex, could have left it this way and called the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 Westbound Gonzales needs to be resurfaced from about a mile before the 
intersection, and the striping is terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 When can we motorists who drive this route daily expect some relief? 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Lohmeyer, Point Mugu 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 What you see at Gonzales and Rose is a work in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 When Shopping at the Rose opened, the developers agreed to pave and stripe 
most of the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 One section, namely westbound Gonzales, was not part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to put this final part of the project out to bid by the end of 
the year, Oxnard Operation Superintendent Jim Weeks says. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is scheduled to begin in April. 
</P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Are there any plans to remedy the traffic problem at Moorpark and Tierra 
Rejada roads in Moorpark? 
</P>
<P>
 Even though there have been several accidents at this T-shaped intersection, 
it is regulated by a lone stop sign for northbound Moorpark Road traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that there is enough eastbound and westbound traffic here for 
some additional stop signs or a signal. 
</P>
<P>
 My neighbor was just injured in an accident at that intersection, and we're 
wondering what it will take to get some additional traffic control there. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Davis, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Both the city of Moorpark and the county are concerned about the traffic 
tangles at this intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The two share responsibility for the area since Tierra Rejada falls within the 
city limits and Moorpark Road is in county territory. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, both applied for funding to remedy the problem, and the Ventura 
County Transportation Commission chose the county's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 A $3.2-million overhaul, complete with road widenings and traffic signals, 
should be under way by late 1996 or early 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the delay? The intersection falls in an ecologically sensitive area, and 
the county must conduct a full environmental impact report before proceeding 
with the project, Deputy Public Works Director Butch Britt says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an area with wetlands and habitats and possible archeological 
significance," Britt said. "We have to pay attention to these things." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I know from a previous question that no funds are available for widening the 
two-lane section of California 118 between Moorpark and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 How about a simple left-turn lane at the intersection of the highway and Santa 
Clara Avenue, where the highway continues to Saticoy? 
</P>
<P>
 All too often, eastbound traffic gets stuck behind someone trying to make a 
left turn at this signal. 
</P>
<P>
 Since we're only talking about a few feet of roadway for a left-turn lane, 
can't some funds be allotted for that? 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Leeds, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The solution you suggest is not as simple as it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Transportation is aware of the traffic woes of 
travelers on narrow California 118, but installing a left-turn lane at Santa 
Clara Avenue just won't work, Engineer Luu Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Widening the road to make room for another lane would disrupt roadside drains, 
and moving the drains would be a costly task, Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans estimates that it will take about $200,000 to redo the intersection 
and, in these times of tight transportation budgets, this project is pretty low 
on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 But, hey, things could be worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until 1992, all we had there was a flashing red light," Nguyen said. "Now at 
least there's a signal."

PAIN VICTIMS SOFTEN ACHE OF ISOLATION AT GATHERINGS; HEALTH: MEMBERS OF 
ASSOCIATION MEET TWICE A MONTH FOR FRIENDSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING THAT IS OFTEN 
ELUSIVE IN DAILY LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Imagine a sharp, endless toothache, and you still have no idea how much 
chronic pain hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one gripes or grimaces at this meeting of the American Chronic Pain 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Spinal braces, foam cushions and canes carried into the meeting room at St. 
Jude's Catholic Church in Westlake are the only visible clues that the 17 
members here are suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first and third Tuesdays of each month, they gather to talk of lives 
and careers shattered by nonstop pain. 
</P>
<P>
 They share advice on thinking past pain, exercising through pain and just 
living with pain. 
</P>
<P>
 And in two hours of joking banter, hand-holding prayer and frank confession, 
they accomplish together what doctors, drugs and surgery have failed to do: 
They make each other feel better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be getting toward my wits' end if I didn't have the group," said Gene 
Dedick, 75, of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dedick founded the Southern California division of the worldwide self-help 
group seven years ago after a blown Achilles tendon and several spine 
operations left pain shooting through his legs and back. Now there are 17 
chapters in the region and nearly 800 around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get together, we discuss our various problems, how we live with chronic 
pain," Dedick said. "Anyone who does not have chronic pain has no idea of the 
pain and agony we go through." 
</P>
<P>
 No one understands -- that is a common thread of discussion for those who 
suffer with pain that never goes away. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonstop pain, they say, creates an isolating, us-versus-them mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members get tired of hearing complaints. Co-workers are unsympathetic 
or ignorant. Friends drift away. Employers shun you. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't understand. And if you complain, they don't know how to deal 
with it, because they want to help you but they don't know how," said 
association member Mike Taylor of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, 53, has pieced together a multifaceted career after several back 
surgeries and the degeneration of his spine left him unable to walk and 
stricken with chronic pain. 
</P>
<P>
 He moves by wheelchair and travels with a specially equipped van to part-time 
jobs counseling teen-agers, working at a radio station and advising the city of 
Thousand Oaks on services for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 He pushes himself twice monthly to bring his infectious good humor and an 
impish love of dirty jokes to the pain association meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pain is nearly constant, he said, and there are days when he simply 
cannot get out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having a toothache," Taylor said. "What do you do when you have a 
toothache? You go to the dentist. But I can't. That's what chronic pain is 
like." 
</P>
<P>
 June Dube gives up her lunch hours as an executive secretary with a Thousand 
Oaks cosmetics firm to attend the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few members able to hold down a full-time job, Dube said she was 
stricken five years ago with arthritis in both hips and a shoulder and with the 
ache of fibromyalgia burning in her muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 She must work, she said, because she needs the health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Her co-workers are supportive, but they can only imagine what she goes 
through, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult. I have to balance a certain amount of walking, a certain 
amount of sitting and a certain amount of movement. If I sit for too long and 
stand up, my joints are too stiff to move." 
</P>
<P>
 She can't take medicines because of a physical intolerance, and she must wake 
up at 5 a.m. just to stretch out the night's stiffness and get ready for the 
day. At work, she must treat herself with care, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look all right," Dube said. "But because I'm not missing any limbs and I'm 
not bleeding from my eyes, people assume I'm all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Some job interviewers discriminate against those who complain of chronic pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days, they will not accept you if you have limitations," said George 
Wolters, 64, a former American Airlines worker disabled by a herniated disc 
that required several operations. "I could not find anything unless it was on a 
voluntary job basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the association's 7,000 members joined the group not only to find 
relief from pain but to fight the crushing depression that often accompanies 
the months and years of ceaseless discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced from full-time work, confined to home and sometimes bed, some 
chronic-pain sufferers sink into despair and even contemplate suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel there's no purpose to their life," member Craig Holt said. "They 
become completely non-functional." 
</P>
<P>
 Holt, 51, worked as a photo lab technician in the movie industry before 
osteoporosis and arthritis began crumbling his frame. He recently took Dedick's 
place as the association's volunteer liaison to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "And as people become more and more isolated at home with their pain, they can 
feel more and more removed from society and the outside world," he added. "They 
begin to think they're the only persons in the world suffering from this." 
</P>
<P>
 Some accuse chronic-pain victims of being whining hypochondriacs, association 
members say. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, said Dr. Joshua Prager, director of the UCLA Pain Medicine Center, 
patients usually suffer real ills ranging from surgery-induced backaches to 
stress-aggravated stomach disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 And as pain lingers, the psychological burden grows, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just something you feel in your body; it's an emotional experience 
that's partially triggered by what's going on in your body," Prager said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drugs can block the pain, make it manageable. But they often dull the 
patient's sensitivity -- and they can build walls between patients and an 
understanding of why they hurt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Behavior plays a major role in pain," Prager said. "(If) we can relax, we can 
modulate our pain." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, doctors use 
behavior modification to teach patients to work past their pain, pain expert 
Alan H. Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 In five weeks of outpatient treatment, they are taught to stop acting hurt -- 
no grimacing, limping or holding a painful body part. And they practice 
stretches and exercises that make them more mobile, independent and confident, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much of pain can be in a person's head? The answer is that all of it's in 
a person's head -- cut a person's head off and there's no pain," said Roberts, 
head of the clinic's division of medical psychology. "There are a variety of 
reasons why people have chronic pain, some of which is clearly psychological." 
</P>
<P>
 The patient often holds the key to stopping chronic pain, Roberts and Prager 
agreed, and self-help groups often help turn that key. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a chance every day to re-create ourselves," association member 
William Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 years of near-constant pain in his lower spine and legs, the Thousand 
Oaks pharmacist had all but abandoned his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he said, he joined the association five years ago and regained control. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain never ended, but he has reassembled his work to the point where he is 
teaching again at UC San Francisco's School of Pharmacy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell people I can be incredibly productive for about five minutes a day," 
Parker told members at the meeting, squirming uncomfortably on a foam cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I produced two U. S. patents in the past year," he said with a sly smile, "so 
I guess they took about five minutes apiece." FYI

REDEMPTION IN THE RAIN FOREST; EX-MISSIONARY WORKS TO EASE AMAZON INDIANS INTO 
THE PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a novice missionary 44 years ago, Otto Austel trekked to the maw of the 
Amazon wilderness to save the soul of a people who danced with the spirits of 
the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he seeks atonement. 
</P>
<P>
 Choking back tears as autumn leaves eddied outside his Simi Valley estate, the 
65-year-old physician told of a rent to the soul that bound him to a people and 
drove him to medicine. It was brought on not by the demons of the forest but by 
a dying child's haunting innocence: "Why did God make mosquitoes? Why did God 
make malaria?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1959. Martin Austel, born eight years earlier in Brazil, looked up from 
his sickbed in the one-room hut that his father had erected at the edge of the 
jungle and muttered, "Dad, I love you," before taking his final breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after settling his firstborn deep into the Brazilian earth, Otto 
Austel looked back into the eyes of the Indians that he had so feverishly tried 
to befriend since 1950 and saw that they, too, were slipping away from him, 
their culture on its deathbed. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason was Austel and his bedeviling ways of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm trying to undo a lot of my mistakes," said Austel, a brisk and 
still sinewy man who excelled as a high school gymnast. "I had a number of 
converts, very strong converts, but I think they converted me more. . . . 
Rather than changing them now, I'm trying to help them retain their culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Five times since 1990, Austel has journeyed back up the Araguaia River, back 
into the heart of the world's largest rain forest and into the embrace of the 
Karaja Indians he left in 1960. Only the stomach-churning sight of his son's 
grave near the decaying family home darkened the reunion 35 years after 
Martin's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hadn't forgotten me," Austel said quietly, recalling the Karaja who 
greeted him not far from the grave. "They came and hugged me and cried." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no longer a missionary, Austel has taken on no less of a mission in 
his fitful twilight years. His message, as urgent and unwavering as any during 
his youthful calling, is both an indictment and an injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to recognize the destructiveness of progress," Austel said, 
flanked in his lavish living room by antique furniture, a baby grand piano and 
a cello he had played as a child in Los Angeles. "We feel might is right. We 
have the strength and so we conquer." 
</P>
<P>
 Against this free-enterprise energy, this blend of action and noise in which 
the spoils go to the strong, the Karaja have little chance, Austel said. He 
said theirs is not a competitive world. It is communal. The family, the group, 
the village overshadow the individual hunter, the individual child. Everybody 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much is being said about the destruction of the rain forest," Austel said. 
"(But) very little concern is shown for the survival of these cultures that are 
becoming extinct. To my knowledge, there's more money spent to save the condor 
and the spotted owl than to save all the Indians of Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 So his mission, Austel said, is to help ease the Karaja into the modern world. 
</P>
<P>
 Crediting the nonpolitical Rotary International with turning his life around, 
Austel said he and several other Rotarians have been traveling to Brazil once 
or twice a year to minister to the Indians' medical, dental and nutritional 
needs. He has inspired his fellow Rotarians in Brazil to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rotary motto is 'Service above self,' to look beyond yourself," said 
Austel, a man versed in chess and astronomy, bonsai horticulture and downhill 
skiing. "Those are the principles I accept." 
</P>
<P>
 With him on his latest pilgrimage, which ended June 29, were Simi Valley 
dentist Ken Kolz and his 20-year-old daughter, Michelle Kolz. She served as 
dental technician during her father's examinations of Karaja children, their 
tiny mouths lit by flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivid even now, Michelle Kolz said, is a nighttime river passage in which she 
and the others returned from Macuaba, a Karaja village about 325 miles 
northwest of Brasilia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just like the jungle boat ride at Disneyland," she said. "It was 
amazing. . . . We had to hold up a big light so we could find our way back." 
</P>
<P>
 As the jungle closed in on them, their 14-foot skiff slid through an edgy 
darkness pierced by the glow of alligator eyes and the cool winking of stars 
through the canopy of trees. Creatures of the forest -- monkeys, insects, frogs 
-- gave out the cry and murmur of another time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll never be able to go back (to the past)," Austel said of the Karaja. 
"That's the deal with progress. The problem is healing them through this 
transition." 
</P>
<P>
 With each buzz of the chain saw and each plume of smoke, the Karaja are 
finding themselves in an ever-shrinking and ever-baffling environment, he said. 
They have new diets, new ways of eking out a living, new problems. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer can they move from campsite to campsite, so they must dig latrines 
and drill for water, Austel said. No longer can they harvest enough fish with 
arrows, so they often resort to gill nets. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer can they work just three hours a day for survival needs, so they 
invest less time in reaffirming the ties of family and friendship that had long 
bound them against the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just enjoyed life," Austel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Intoxicated now by consumer goods -- clothes, toiletries, radios -- the Karaja 
are being corrupted, too, by 20th-Century temptations that are beyond their 
reach because they lack the skills to get a paying job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken away all these lands and the chances of all these (Indian) 
nations of living a life of their choice," Austel said. "They're literally 
being forced to accept civilization or else live a life of poverty or 
extinction." 
</P>
<P>
 During his latest two-month visit, Austel and his fellow volunteers offered 
their services to nine Indian villages. They treated illnesses. They cleaned 
teeth. They helped build outhouses. They helped plant fruit trees -- papaya, 
avocado, citrus -- to fortify the diet of the Karaja. 
</P>
<P>
 They also gave the Indians an X-ray machine, equipment for eyeglasses, 1,500 
toothbrushes and irrigation pumps for farming, which Austel helped introduce to 
the Karaja four decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, Austel said, the volunteers taught the Indians how to better 
care for themselves medically. They showed them how to diagnose ailments, 
suture wounds and screen for malaria. It was a complication of malaria -- 
black-water fever -- that claimed Martin Austel three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also what got Austel into medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 An intensely driven missionary from Los Angeles, Austel had focused first on 
saving souls. But he did not fully grasp the flesh-and-blood Indians, he said, 
until his son's passing gave him the vision to see that they, too, had their 
own children whose deaths would leave them no less devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, for a man who had baptized their young in the muddy river and 
helped bury their dead by its banks, "this was a revelation," Austel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another revelation was the fact that the Indians, so deathly vulnerable to 
such Western illnesses as chicken pox and measles, had no doctor within 1 
million square miles of rain forest in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to lure a physician to serve the Karaja, Austel finally resolved to 
become a doctor himself. He could not help his son, but maybe he could help the 
sons and daughters of the Karaja. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son was so important to me," Austel said in a broken voice, "so very, very 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1950, when Austel had first penetrated the interior with his wife, 
Dreda, all he had were Bibles and the burning certitude that he must wrest the 
savages from the darkness and bathe them in the light of a Western god. A 
trained linguist, he was also charged with capturing their native tongue on 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was that if (we) taught them to read and write, (the Indians) could 
read the Bible and that would save their souls," Austel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chastened four decades later, he added, "but what good is learning how to read 
and write, when this is a people who must learn about the land, the animals, 
the trees? That's their world. That's what they know."

 After his second five-year missionary tour ended in 1960, Austel brought his 
wife and their two sons back to Southern California. He worked as an insurance 
agent while attending Cal State Los Angeles for his undergraduate degree and 
what is now UC Irvine for his medical degree in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Brazilian army, adhering to a shift in political winds since Austel's 
missionary years, blocked access to the interior in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Settling instead on a career at home, Austel moved his family, now including 
another son, to Simi Valley in 1969 and founded the Family Health Care Medical 
Group, which has about 30 physicians and 40,000 patients. He and Dreda divorced 
in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 "His intention was always to go back to Brazil," said his second wife, Sharon 
Austel, 48, who accompanied Austel on his first return to the Karaja in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Indians' world had radically changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they have to go into the jungles and slash and burn and plant," Otto 
Austel said. "It's a tremendous amount of hard work . . . and they're getting 
minimal results." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Karaja look up at the sky during sunset, they are, in effect, looking 
at their past world, at the ash and smoke remnants of vanished trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sunsets are much prettier than they were before," Austel said. "But it's 
at a high cost."

STREET SMART: PORTOLA / JEFFREY INTERSECTION WILL SOON TAKE A TURN FOR THE 
BETTER 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart:  
</P>
<P>
 This letter is in regard to the intersection of Portola Parkway and Jeffrey 
Road in Irvine. When traveling from the Foothill Transportation Corridor toward 
Irvine, Portola Parkway has two lanes of traffic. However, when traffic wanting 
to turn left approaches the intersection of Jeffrey Road (which is 99% of the 
traffic), both lanes must merge into the one left-hand lane to access the two 
left-hand turn lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't they have the two lanes on Portola lead straight into the two 
left-turn lanes at Jeffrey? This would eliminate the last-minute merge of cars 
from two lanes into one lane back to two lanes again. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, this would be an easy modification because there is plenty of 
room for re-striping. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Andrews 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Here's an early Christmas present for you. Orange County is working to fix 
this problem by mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignacio Ochoa, the county traffic engineer, said road crews will sandblast the 
current striping on Portola and repaint the pavement so the two left lanes of 
traffic can flow into the two left turn lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of years ago, I read in the paper that the only lights allowed on the 
front of a car after dark for street driving are the regular headlight beams 
and the parking lights. That is two sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Now all the cars seem to be getting another pair of lights down low (too low 
for the legal limits, according to the article I read), and these lights 
absolutely blind me at night. These cars have three sets of lights on the front 
now, instead of the legal two. I can't see that the road is any easier to see 
in front of the cars with six lights than in front of the cars with four. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are legal, why are they legal when they are so blinding? And if they 
are not legal, why are so many people driving around with them? Can anything be 
done about this? 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Falconer 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 I agree with you about these annoying low lights, but the law contradicts us 
both. These lights, called fog lamps, are legal, according to the California 
Vehicle Code. The code also states that the front of a vehicle can legally be 
outfitted with up to four pairs of (or eight individual) lights or lamps. 
</P>
<P>
 If properly installed by the manufacturer, fog lamps should not be blinding. 
By state law, these lights must no higher than 30 inches from the ground and 
positioned so the brightest part of the beam is at least four inches below the 
center of the lamp 25 feet ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a fog lamp that is out of alignment can cause glare. What can be 
done? Precious little, according to the California Highway Patrol. A vehicle 
owner can be cited only if a CHP officer witnesses the misalignment firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any way to redesign or re-mark the intersection of Paseo de Valencia 
and Laguna Hills Drive heading south? 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that traffic traveling in that direction makes dangerous lane changes 
in order to turn right onto Laguna Hills Drive. The bicycle lane turns into an 
auto lane approximately 500 feet before the intersection, and cars wanting to 
remain in the far right lane are almost sideswiped. 
</P>
<P>
 The only marking for the far right lane is about 50 feet before the 
intersection and during rush hour it makes for some scary maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Leo 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This intersection is shared by the city of Laguna Hills and the county. In 
late October, county traffic engineer Ignacio Ochoa received a letter from the 
Laguna Hills traffic engineer seeking support for a project that would widen 
and improve it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa said the number of accidents at this intersection has not been high, but 
the area is heavily traveled and these improvements would provide more room and 
ease of mobility for motorists. Depending on funding and acquiring right of 
way, the soonest the work could begin is in 1997, with an anticipated 
completion date of mid-summer 1998, Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements would include creating dual left-turn lanes from northbound Paseo 
de Valencia onto Laguna Hills Drive and adding a separate right-turn lane from 
southbound Paseo de Valencia onto Laguna Hills Drive. That short third lane 
that crops up 50 feet before the intersection would be extended, Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For the Record: The Streetsmart column Oct. 31 incorrectly listed the opening 
date of a five-mile segment of car-pool lane on the Riverside Freeway in Los 
Angeles County between the San Gabriel River Freeway and the Orange County 
line. The segment will open this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The public still has time to voice its views on improving traffic through a 
six-mile-wide, 28-mile-long corridor between Fullerton and Irvine. The Orange 
County Transportation Authority is accepting comments for its urban transit 
corridor study via phone, fax and letter through Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 People may call OCTA customer relations at (714) 560-5700 between 7:30 a.m. 
and 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Voice mail will record messages after 
business hours. Comments also may be faxed to (714) 560-5794 or mailed to Julie 
Rush, OCTA Planning and Development, 550 S. Main St., Orange, CA 92613-1584.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to retain $100,000 in state grants, the Ventura City Council 
will vote today on whether to designate an antique Spanish laundry as a local 
historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been in a dispute with the state Office of Historic Preservation 
over the money since May. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials maintain that they awarded the grant for the express purpose 
of preserving Peirano's Market, an old Italian grocery that was built on Main 
Street in 1877. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city, which now owns the defunct market, wants to tear down part of 
the structure's walls, build a small shopping area in the interior and showcase 
the lavanderia , or laundry, which lies under the market's storage rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the city, the lavanderia was built in 1782 and thus is just as 
deserving of the landmark designation -- and the money -- as the aging grocery.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; MALATHION SPRAYING SCHEDULED TONIGHT

<P>
 Weather permitting, a third spraying of the pesticide malathion in the battle 
against the Medfly will be applied tonight over an 18-square-mile stretch of 
eastern Camarillo, agriculture officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A quick-moving storm prevented a trio of helicopters from taking off from 
Camarillo Airport on Wednesday, said Larry Hawkins, an official of the 
Cooperative Medfly Project.The spraying to kill the crop-munching pest was 
rescheduled for tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 National Weather Service spokesman Robert Cari said the forecast for Ventura 
County called for dry and fair skies today, with increasing cloudiness starting 
Wednesday. Winds up to 15 m.p.h. will be from the northeast, with no rain 
expected through the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Cari said daytime highs will be in the low 70s, while overnight lows will 
hover in the mid-40s. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins said strict conditions govern the spraying of malathion. He said if 
rain is expected up to 24 hours after an application, the operation is 
canceled. In addition, he said winds must be 10 m.p.h. or less to prevent the 
pesticide from drifting once it is released. 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture officials said a planned pre-Thanksgiving spraying of malathion 
has been rescheduled to Nov. 29. J. E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BEACH CLEANUP PLAN PROPOSED FOR SPRING

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever wanted a stretch of beach for your very own? Yours to plaster your name 
all over -- and yours to clean up? 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura may offer a bargain deal on public sand and ocean in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 The Adopt-a-Beach program would allow individuals and companies to claim a 
length of public turf and erect a sign on that beach with their names. 
</P>
<P>
 The sponsor would then take on all responsibility for keeping that stretch 
free of trash and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had interest expressed from a lot of businesses about doing something 
different at the beaches," said Bill Byerts, Ventura's parks manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Byerts said the city has hired a consultant to organize the program, which 
officials hope will be in place by late spring. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; FIRE IN GARAGE CAUSES $125,000 IN DAMAGE

<P>
 Smoldering ashes in a trash can inside the garage of a house near Camarillo 
started a fire that caused $125,000 in damage early Sunday, fire officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A smoke alarm woke up residents of the Deseo Avenue house about 4 a.m. Sunday, 
when flames from the trash can spread to the garage, Ventura County Fire 
Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was mostly limited to the garage, which received about $65,000 in 
structural damage, officials estimated. A small corner of the house also 
incurred damage, investigators said. The fire also destroyed about $60,000 in 
property, including a new van and a Honda Accord, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was seriously injured in the blaze, which took about 40 firefighters 
more than an hour to extinguish. 
</P>
<P>
 One firefighter was treated at St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital for a minor 
hand injury and was later released, a Fire Department spokeswoman said. JEFF

TEAMS SEARCH MATILIJA CANYON FOR 2 HIKERS

<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff's Department search-and-rescue teams spent Sunday 
combing Matilija Canyon looking for two hikers who failed to report Saturday 
after a day hike in the heavily wooded canyon north of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 After James Seebirt, 56, of Ojai and Bill Hallfish, 59, of Camarillo failed to 
return home after sundown Saturday, family members notified authorities, who 
quickly began organizing a search of the canyon, Sheriff's Lt. Gary Backman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first search teams hit the trails about 2 a.m. Sunday, with a helicopter 
unit joining them at dawn, Backman said.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: FAIRY TALE IS A DREAM COME TRUE FOR RETIREE-TURNED-AUTHOR

 Mollie Mole of Northridge, who is president of the Los Angeles chapter of the 
Romance Writers of America, has struggled for years to become a published 
novelist. At last she has achieved her goal with release of her first book by 
Harlequin's America Romance Novels Division. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mole, 72, is quick to distinguish herself from the stereotyped notion of 
the romance novelist as Barbara Courtland-esque creatures who sit in bed in 
negligees batting foot-long eyelashes while penning purple prose between 
nibbles of bon bons and sips of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 Mole does her writing on a computer in her kitchen between her part-time job 
as a travel agent and visits from friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 She rolls her eyes heavenward at the description of romance novels as "bodice 
rippers." "That may be a description of flamboyant, unrealistic English romance 
novels, but doesn't apply to novels written in the United States," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian-born author, who came to Los Angeles with her family when she was 
a baby, worked as an administrator for 30 years at Lockheed in Burbank, 
retiring from her $39,000-a-year job when she was 65. 
</P>
<P>
 She married after finishing one year of college, and for 25 years worked full 
time and tended to her husband and two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 After her first husband died, she returned to college, graduating from Cal 
State Northridge with a bachelor's degree in sociology at age 53. 
</P>
<P>
 She remarried and continued to work, but felt an unfulfilled longing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved the people I worked with, but I had no outlet for my creative side at 
Lockheed," she says. "I guess I must have mentioned I wanted to become a writer 
because they gave me an electric typewriter when I retired." 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to write, she enrolled at classes at the Learning Tree University 
in the San Fernando Valley. Unlike millions of novelist wanna-bes, she knew she 
had to study structure, plot and other writing basics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me several years to get to the point where I had the skills," says 
Mole, who wrote three books before her first was published. 
</P>
<P>
 "My breakthrough came when I attended a talk by Harlequin senior editor Debra 
Matteucci at an Orange County Romance Writers of America meeting," Mole says. 
"Debra, who is now my editor, told the group's 400 members that her company had 
tip sheets for anyone interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Mole was interested. She sent for one and read it, then wrote a book following 
the suggestions. The rest is the icing on her personal history. 
</P>
<P>
 "After four years of struggling to become a published author, it happened," 
said the happy writer who took to heart Matteucci's description of a romance 
novel as a contemporary fairy tale in which all dreams can come true. 
</P>
<P>
 Mole, whose name is pronounced Molay, and who writes under the name of Molay 
to avoid mispronunciation, enjoys the new-found benefits of being a published 
author. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent cruise through the Panama Canal, the crew found out she was a 
novelist, and she was asked to speak to the other passengers, becoming an 
instant celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 She will be speaking at 7 tonight at the Barnes & Noble bookstore in 
Northridge to budding authors and those interested in starting a second career. 
Also, she has contracts for two more books -- one she has completed and the 
other she is now writing. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she is happiest about a writers group that gathers at her home 
every Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started out to be a work group but has turned into something more than 
that," says Mole. "We read one another's manuscripts and make suggestions, but 
mostly we have become like a second family. It's a wonderful feeling." Zoo 
Group Heads for Wilds of Desert for Thanksgiving 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Stiles, a Northridge elementary school teacher, says she becomes 
stir-crazy when she can't get away from the urban sprawl for a nature fix. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I am now teaching year-round, I didn't get my usual camping vacation 
with my family this summer, so I really need to get away," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why she, her husband, and their 12-year-old son, Evan, are going to 
be joining other members of the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn., or GLAZA, on a 
Thanksgiving weekend campout at Anza-Borrego State Park south of Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first of what may become an annual GLAZA-sponsored outing. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is being organized by Dave Wyman, who has made a full-time job out 
of arranging camping trips. Wyman was a Sierra Club camping leader during his 
days as a UCLA undergraduate and then became the wilderness resource director 
at USC, a post in which he arranged student campouts and ski trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my wife, Kathy, and I tried to figure out a business we would love and 
would allow us to work together as a family, we decided putting together 
camping trips is what we wanted to do," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Campers who want to attend the GLAZA family event, which is open to the 
public, need only bring their own sleeping bags and tents. Wyman supplies the 
rest of the equipment for $95 per adult, which includes food, hikes, cookouts, 
side trips and campfire events. 
</P>
<P>
 This sounds pretty good to Stiles and her husband, Dusty, a Beverly Hills High 
School teacher. The couple met in graduate school in Connecticut and did much 
of their courting in the great outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know anyone else who will be at the camp, but we are looking forward 
to getting together with other families with like interests," she says. "It's a 
wonderful area if you love the desert." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who can't vacation without hot and cold running room service, the 
zoo has another offer: attend the annual Thanksgiving Beastly Feast. 
</P>
<P>
 Over Thanksgiving weekend, visitors will be able to watch the animals being 
fed their annual holiday feast of foodstuffs reminiscent of holiday meals. 
Watching the hippos toss around their salad and the gorillas peel oranges is a 
visual treat, zoo lovers say.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; CAUTIONARY TALES ABOUT RELIGIOUS AGENDAS; APPEALS TO 
UNIVERSAL VALUES MAY WORK BETTER WITH VOTERS THAN BIBLICAL QUOTATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN J. HUBBARD, Benjamin J. Hubbard is a professor and chair of the 
department of religious studies at Cal State Fullerton. The book he co-edited, 
The Abraham ConnectionA Jew, Christian and Muslim in Dialogue, has just been 
released. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did religious communities play a positive role in last Tuesday's elections -- 
particularly at the local level -- or did they meddle unnecessarily and damage 
their credibility? 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that the survey of local candidates by Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa 
on specific moral issues (abortion, gay rights, sexuality education) backfired 
and forced the church to distance itself from the questionnaire. The majority 
of candidates didn't even respond because of the survey's narrow focus and 
demand for yes or no answers to complex questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roman Catholic Church fought in vain to defeat Proposition 187, as did the 
liberal Protestant California Council of Churches, which also supported 
Proposition 186, for state health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 To what extent are religious groups justified in becoming involved in 
politics? To a considerable degree, according to Stephen Carter in his highly 
acclaimed 1993 book "The Culture of Disbelief." He argues that religion is no 
hobby or extracurricular activity and should have a place in the public square. 
In fact, it is a "very subversive force," particularly to those in America 
"committed to the proposition that religious ways of looking at the world do 
not count." Recent history proves Carter's point: The civil rights movement was 
born and nurtured in the black churches of the south; the anti-Vietnam War 
movement had a powerful base in the liberal churches and synagogues of the 
north; and conservative Christians have catalyzed a national debate over 
abortion, euthanasia and gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
 While I agree with Carter that religious groups should carry out this 
"subversive" activity on behalf of the moral issues they feel so deeply about, 
they need to proceed with caution. I offer these guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 * Take a stand based on sound reasoning, not religious doctrine. The public 
will be won over not by biblical quotations interpreted in a sectarian way but 
by persuasive appeals to universal values such as decency and justice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stick to relevant issues, especially at the local level. One of the Calvary 
Chapel queries to candidates for city or county government positions asked, 
"Will you support laws restoring legal protection for unborn children from 
conception, with the possible exception that a medical procedure is necessary 
to prevent the mother's death?" Not only is this an issue having no bearing on 
the elected duties of a local government official, it involves the most complex 
moral question of our time. What if the candidate is opposed to abortion except 
in cases of rape or incest? Or is pro-choice, yet sees abortion as a option to 
be chosen only for the most serious of reasons, strongly preferring 
contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancies? Does a yes or no answer suffice? 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't implicitly set up a "religious test" for public office. Not only does 
the Constitution expressly forbid such tests, they are inherently repugnant to 
those of different religious backgrounds. Thus when Pat Robertson and his local 
counterparts in the Christian Coalition start talking about electing 
"Christians" or the "godly" or "Bible believers" to public office, they are 
crossing the church-state boundary line. 
</P>
<P>
 * Educate voters by allowing candidates to explain briefly their positions 
rather than forcing them to answer "yes" or "no" to complex questions. One of 
the yes-or-no questions to school board candidates on the Calvary Chapel survey 
asked, "Will you support an abstinence-only program that does not present 
premarital sex (with or without contraceptives) or abortion as responsible or 
acceptable options?" The candidates were expected to bubble in the "yes" or 
"no" column and go right on to the next question. What I suspect many of them 
would like to have done is explain how complex the issue of premarital sexual 
activity is, how abstinence is clearly the ideal and should be encouraged in 
all ways possible; yet, how an estimated 80% of teen-agers are sexually active 
by their senior year of high school and need information about how to avoid 
unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 If a religious organization really wishes to provide comprehensive voter 
information to its members, it might, for example, consider soliciting a short 
statement from school board candidates on how they plan to improve the quality 
of learning and the safety of the school yard. Or a statement from the city 
council candidates on how to promote new jobs in their districts. For, at root, 
these are questions with profound moral implications.

 CRYING FOWL: Like eggs? Well, be warned that a strain of salmonella food 
poisoning transmitted mostly by undercooked eggs is on the rise here. Victims 
suffer diarrhea and cramps eight to 72 hours after eating and can be sick for a 
week. . . . To be safe, cook eggs -- whether boiled, fried or poached -- until 
the yolks don't run. "This is where we become unpopular" with egg lovers, says 
a county health official. . . . Also, thoroughly clean anything that comes in 
contact with uncooked chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 A MYSTERY: Health officials are unsure why gonorrhea is on the decline in 
Orange County while other sexually transmitted diseases, which are caused by 
the microorganisms chlamydiae, are up. . . . The number of chlamydia cases 
reported to health officials almost quadrupled to 4,196 between 1990 and 1993. 
It could be due to improved testing, says one county official, but possibly 
"there is something going on that we don't understand." . . . Both types of 
disease frequently affect young adults. They can be symptomless in women, 
possibly causing infertility if untreated. 
</P>
<P>
 HIDDEN TOLL: The lesser publicized victims of AIDS are children of afflicted 
parents. . . . They "end up being derived of their childhood to some degree," 
says a spokesman for the AIDS Services Foundation of Orange County. . . . So 
the foundation will use much of a $250,000 grant from the Wilbur D. May 
Foundation to finance a weekend family camp, family support groups and family 
counseling. With such programs, the agency hopes to help kids "just be kids 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 TEEN SHOTS: All teen-agers need to be vaccinated against Hepatitis B, a 
disease primarily affecting young people, says the Society for Adolescent 
Medicine, and UC Irvine liver specialist John Hoefs agrees. . . . The 
recommendation used to be for infants and high-risk youths, but experts 
expanded it last week because it's difficult to tell who is at risk. 
Transmitted through blood and body fluids, the disease can play havoc with the 
liver and lead to cirrhosis and cancer. Egg Warning

 A Chinese court sentenced to death a man convicted of arson after he set fire

 Zhang Zongling was found guilty by the People's Intermediate Court in Jinan,

the Oct. 30 arson attack, the agency said Sunday.

<P>
 He decided to take revenge after his lover, a classmate at the Shandong 
Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, jilted him, and he set fire to her 
dormitory, the agency said. It did not say whether Zhang's lover was among the 
victims.

CHARITY ON WHEELS; MORE THAN 21,000 BIKERS HIT THE HIGHWAY TO RAISE FUNDS TO 
FIGHT MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY

<P>
 It's the can't-miss party of the motorcycling world -- the largest event of 
its kind in the nation and a gathering of the good, the bad and the ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the Love Ride. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 21,000 bikers -- most of them straddling powerful Harley-Davidsons 
-- rumbled into Glendale early Sunday to take part in the 11th annual charity 
ride from Glendale to Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands more turned out to see celebrities and to cheer everyone on, 
mingling with the bikers at ground zero on San Fernando Road or crowding along 
overpasses of the Golden State Freeway, as folks like Ugly Carl, a Canoga Park 
motorcycle mechanic on his eighth Love Ride in 11 years, zoomed underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love it. It's fun, it's a good benefit, and it's a great excuse to get 
together with 20,000 of my best friends," said Carl, who rides with a group of 
about 50 entertainers who call themselves The Uglys. 
</P>
<P>
 The event benefits the Los Angeles chapter of the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. 
Last year's ride raised more than $1 million for 11 clinics and two summer 
camps in the Los Angeles area, as well as money for medical research, said Joan 
Rovegno, regional director for the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers expect to raise at least the same amount from this year's ride, a 
magnet for motorcyclists of all ages, shapes and sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love the bikers. They represent a wide range of the community, from 
doctors to lawyers to hard-core riders to celebrities," Rovegno said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just 'cause they ride Harleys doesn't mean they're not nice guys. The people 
who ride other bikes, they're nice too -- just a little intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the rugged-looking men and women wearing leather motorcycle jackets, 
chaps, caps and boots seemed to enjoy a camaraderie that ignored social class 
or standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether a famous television celebrity or just a regular guy, most participants 
view the Love Ride as a harmonic convergence of Harley riders for a good cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a timeless thing," said actor Peter Fonda, whose performance in "Easy 
Rider" in 1969 helped mold the image of the nomadic biker answering the call of 
the open road. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get on the bikes, we're not bald or fat or old," Fonda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get on a Harley and you're still cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Fonda was joined by dozens of Hollywood celebrities, including actor Lorenzo 
Lamas, who stars on the television show "Renegade," musician Axl Rose and 
actress Pamela Anderson of the TV series "Baywatch." "Tonight Show" host Jay 
Leno served as this year's grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all the celebrities felt at home on a Sportster or a Softail Harley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Love Ride virgin," confessed Kris Jenner, who rode with her husband, 
Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner. 
</P>
<P>
 The procession of shiny bikes, which filled half a mile of San Fernando Road, 
began pulling out of Glendale about 9:30 a.m. and rode north for the next two 
hours beneath a bright November sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The beautiful weather warmed a man who identified himself as Randy Cowboy, a 
veteran biker from Vancouver, B.C., who came to Southern California with a 
couple of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to get out of the snow, eh?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been down here for a week and who knows where we're going from here. 
Maybe Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
 Another longtime rider, Frank Bizelli, 40, of Burbank, once lived the outlaw 
biker lifestyle. He marveled at how little some riders with expensive bikes 
knew about riding them. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy asked me to start his bike for him today. I'm not kidding," Bizelli 
said. "He forgot to turn the key -- you know, to start the bike." 
</P>
<P>
 In his previous life, Bizelli said, he had one charity: himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never would have done this for charity before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in it for myself. In the past, had I raised money I would have kept it 
for myself and stuck it up my arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've been clean and sober for the last six years."

SUIT PITS TEACHER AGAINST SCHOOL DISTRICT; COURTS: JURY IS NOW HEARING A 
SO-CALLED WHISTLE-BLOWER CASE IN WHICH SHEILA HOPPER ACCUSES OFFICIALS OF 
RETALIATION AFTER SHE COMPLAINED ABOUT PROBLEMS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was never about money, Sheila Hopper says. 
</P>
<P>
 The special education teacher says she filed her federal lawsuit against the 
Los Angeles Unified School District on behalf of thousands of learning-disabled 
students -- students such as 10-year-old Evangelina at Nestle Avenue Elementary 
School in Tarzana. A fifth-grader when Hopper met her, the girl could not spell 
her own name, let alone read. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of how it began, federal case No. 93-2441 -- initially filed to 
force the district to comply with federal education mandates -- has become a 
so-called whistle-blower suit. It is indeed a matter of money now -- and a 
matter of reputation -- for Hopper and the nation's second-largest school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopper, a fiery and eloquent 56-year-old, alleges that district officials 
began retaliating against her after she began making noise, denying her 
promotions and even falsely accusing her of child abuse. The suit, which went 
to trial Tuesday, does not specify a sum, but seeks compensation for "loss of 
reputation, humiliation, extreme emotional distress, depression and physical 
illness." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been repeatedly retaliated against by the district," said Hopper, who 
has taught in L.A. Unified classrooms for more than two decades. "I deserve 
compensation. This has significantly affected my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Many colleagues, administrators and parents who have dealt with Hopper, 
however, say she is a woman in love with conflict, obsessive over issues as 
grand as federal lawsuits and as trivial as where she was seated at a PTA 
luncheon. It is they, some say, who should be compensated for emotional 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 parents and 11 of 15 teachers at Nestle signed a petition last 
spring asking for Hopper's immediate removal, citing, among a four-page list of 
complaints, her "constant browbeating and abuse" of colleagues. The petition 
was never sent to district officials, gatherers said, because Hopper herself 
requested a transfer shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think basically she's a good teacher," said Howard Friedman, assistant 
general counsel for the school district. But Hopper sees herself as "Joan of 
Arc, maybe . . . Captain Ahab." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopper's attorney prefers a different analogy, calling the Sheila 
Hopper-school district conflict a "classic David and Goliath" duel. And he 
points out that when Hopper complained that the district was failing to meet 
the needs of special education students, state and federal authorities said she 
was right. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, Hopper -- who frequently and proudly refers to herself as 
a whistle-blower -- has undoubtedly been a shrill call in the ear of the 
district for at least five years. Now, a jury of four men and four women will 
offer its own take on the longtime teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 A wiry and energetic wife and mother who quotes detailed special education 
laws from memory, Hopper contends that the harassment began not long after she 
met Evangelina in 1988. Hopper complained to district officials that the girl, 
who was enrolled in a regular fifth-grade class, had never been evaluated 
despite her obvious learning disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens all the time," she said. Children with apparent learning 
disabilities wait months or even years to be assessed and directed to 
appropriate classes. And once an assessment is made, many students still do not 
receive the level of special instruction deemed necessary, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopper compiled her documents on Evangelina and special education problems in 
general and took them to district officials in 1989. When they failed to 
respond, she said, she upped the stakes, filing formal complaints with the 
state Department of Education. The charge: The district chronically failed to 
meet guidelines for evaluating and teaching special education students. 
</P>
<P>
 The district receives about $20 million a year in federal funds to operate 
programs for about 60,000 students with special needs, but Hopper contended it 
was not spending the money properly. Another teacher, for instance, had 
requested in 1987 that Evangelina be evaluated. A year later, no assessment was 
even being planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Education investigated and upheld Hopper's claims. But 
nothing changed, Hopper said, and she went a step further -- to the U.S. 
Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights. In early 1990, the OCR also 
found the district out of compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The state and OCR ordered the district to correct the deficiencies. L.A. 
unified officials say some problems have been addressed; Hopper says most still 
have not. 
</P>
<P>
 As the letters and complaints were flying back and forth between Hopper, the 
district and various governmental agencies, the retaliation was beginning, 
Hopper contends. 
</P>
<P>
 One month after filing the complaint with the Office of Civil Rights in 
January, 1990, Hopper's principal at Nestle Elementary, Jacklyn Thompson, filed 
child abuse charges against Hopper with the police and school district. Among 
other things, she alleged that Hopper had pulled a student's arm behind his 
back until the boy cried, and pushed him, causing him to hit his eye on a file 
cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 The police quickly dropped the case for lack of evidence. The district 
investigated and Thompson levied the harshest suspension possible under the 
teachers' contract: Hopper would be suspended for 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopper appealed, her attorneys contending in documents that the charges were 
bogus and filed "only because she is a whistle-blower." 
</P>
<P>
 A state hearings officer ruled in favor of Hopper, saying Principal Thompson's 
investigation was so poorly conducted as to be "incredible" and that there was 
no evidence of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 In her suit, Hopper also contends that she has suffered stress-related skin 
rashes from the retaliation, and that she was denied a job at another 
elementary school after officials there learned she had named that school 
specifically as one that violated the special education mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is pretty much a standard response in LAUSD," said James Fosbinder, 
Hopper's attorney. "If someone challenges the system, they are branded 
unreliable, unstable." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles attorney Bonni Garcia, who is representing the school district, 
said Hopper was just another malcontent and promised in opening arguments 
Tuesday that the defense would provide ample evidence the district committed 
"no acts of retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit now focuses on the alleged retaliation but initially aimed at a 
far larger target. Hopper wanted a judge to order the district to either comply 
with the education mandates it was violating or repay the federal government 
upward of $300 million in special education funds. The judge agreed to hear the 
retaliation charges but tossed out other parts of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Hopper's prickly relationship with the district, her critics say she 
brought many problems upon herself. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of parents, teachers and teacher aides from Nestle Avenue Elementary 
gathered at a Tarzana residence recently to discuss their dealings with Hopper 
-- who requested a transfer at the end of the last school year and now teaches 
at Darby Avenue Elementary in Northridge. Displaying a thick stack of 
handwritten letters from Hopper to back up their tales, they told of several 
incidents that they said began as "petty" and "trivial" disagreements and were 
fanned by Hopper into heated battles. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the dispute over a parking space, which so escalated that Hopper 
demanded that the teachers union settle the squabble. Then there was the time 
Hopper complained to her principal that other teachers and PTA members 
purposely slighted her at a school luncheon. The offense? She was seated at the 
end of the table. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roger Segure, who as director of grievance processing for the teachers 
union, United Teachers-Los Angeles, has handled several cases for Hopper in 
recent years, says her popularity, or lack thereof, is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether she's likable to people is not the issue," Segure said. The issue is: 
"She blew the whistle and the district retaliated." 
</P>
<P>
 Although battling the second-largest school district in the nation has been 
both physically and emotionally exhausting, Hopper said, she is getting used to 
her role as head boat rocker. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say to me, 'Why don't you get on with your life?' " she said. "I'm 
committed to this."

GIRL DIES OF HIT-AND-RUN INJURIES SUFFERED AFTER HOMECOMING DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old girl who was struck by a hit-and-run driver as she left a high 
school dance died of her injuries Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilia Barajas died at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center about 10 p.m. Saturday, 
Burbank Police Lt. Don Brown said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 She and a companion were hit by a car traveling on the wrong side of the 
street after they left the Glendale High School homecoming dance on Friday 
night at the Castaway restaurant, 1250 Harvard Road, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilia's companion, a 16-year-old boy, was treated for a broken arm at Thompson 
Memorial Medical Center in Burbank and released, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been here for 34 years and have seen a lot, but stuff like this really 
bothers you," Brown said of the girl's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Lilia, a sophomore at Glendale High, had just celebrated her 
birthday. Her date was a student at Allan F. Daily High School in Glendale, 
according to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of thing has never occurred before," said Vic Pallo, spokesman for 
the Glendale Unified School District. "It is such a tragedy for it to happen, 
especially on her 16th birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police a black or blue-gray 1983 to 1987 Chevrolet Camaro was 
seen speeding from the restaurant parking lot.

CITY'S TIES TO HOMELESS SHELTER QUESTIONED; SERVICES: DEBATE GROWS OVER 
LANDLORD ROLE AND FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS. SOME ADVOCATE TRANSFER OF 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials here are debating the city's role as landlord of a 5-year-old, 
40-bed homeless shelter that continues to seek city money for building repairs 
and operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mayor Arnie Rodio criticized the continuing flow of city dollars into 
the shelter last week, just before City Council members allocated another 
$63,000 for repairs and expansion of the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 That came on top of $117,000 included for the shelter in this year's 
redevelopment budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intent of the shelter was not to be that way," Rodio said afterward. "I 
don't think it's the responsibility of the city to provide these kind of 
facilities on an ongoing basis. They have to get on their own eventually." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman George Runner agreed. "This is consistent with where I've always 
been regarding nonprofit groups," Runner said. "They have to raise their money 
from the public." 
</P>
<P>
 He urged the city staff to ask Catholic Charities, which manages the shelter, 
and other social-service groups if they want to assume ownership and full 
financial responsibility for the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 But some local leaders feel the city has an obligation to continue aiding the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Henry Hearns said he might consider transferring ownership of the 
shelter to a private group but believes the city should continue to provide 
money for its programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have a problem with us cutting off any relationship to it," Hearns 
said. "I don't think we should take our hands back and say we're not going to 
do anything else with this." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond its humanitarian benefits, the shelter serves a public health and 
safety role, Hearns said. "It keeps down a lot of the problems we'd have if 
these people were on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley College President Allan Kurki, who recently agreed to chair 
the shelter's local advisory committee, said the facility needs to do a better 
job of telling the community about its work. And, he said, it must do more of 
its own fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also is concerned about the prospect of a complete cutoff of city aid. 
"In the short run, anyway, I would see it to be extremely difficult for the 
shelter to become self-supporting," Kurki said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Henkin, a Lancaster rabbi who also serves on the shelter's advisory 
board, agrees that the city should continue its support for the shelter. "I 
know this is a tough time for cities. But it's an even tougher time for 
nonprofits. It's just a real tough time to be raising money. Homelessness is 
just not an issue that attracts a whole lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over the city's role in owning and funding the Lancaster Community 
Shelter arises just as the facility is about to mark the fifth anniversary of 
its December, 1989, opening. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter's origins actually date back to 1987, when the city demolished a 
privately run shelter during a downtown renewal project. To take its place, the 
city's Redevelopment Agency provided a parcel of land at 44611 Yucca Ave., 
surrounded by warehouses and auto-repair businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The local chapter of the Building Industry Assn., thriving at the time because 
of a residential building boom, collected materials, raised money and organized 
volunteers to construct much of the 9,900-square-foot shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redevelopment Agency contributed money to finish and furnish the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The city then asked social-service organizations to apply for the job of 
operating the shelter. Catholic Charities was the only group to step forward, 
and the city agreed in 1989 to lease the shelter to that organization for 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Charities does not pay rent for the building, but provides employees 
to run the shelter, including social workers and a cook. Because it receives 
government funds, the shelter's programs have no religious component. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the lease, the city must maintain the building, but it is not required 
to help pay for the shelter's operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, at the request of Catholic Charities, the Redevelopment Agency 
gave the shelter $72,000 its first year and $50,400 the next. During each of 
the last three years, the agency has allocated $117,000 -- a sum that has been 
matched by grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the shelter has six employees and runs on an annual budget of about 
$300,000. Area churches, a Jewish temple and local service groups regularly 
donate food and clothing to the shelter, where dormitories have 24 beds for men 
and eight for women. The shelter also has two private rooms for families, each 
furnished with four beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless people can occupy shelter beds for 30 days on an emergency basis. If 
they qualify, they can remain for up to six months in a transitional-living 
program. During this period, the shelter staff tries to help them find work and 
permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Year-round, the vacancy rate is about 15%. When cold winter weather arrives, 
the facility rarely has empty beds. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter also receives about $47,000 annually from the county to provide 
meals and overnight accommodations for up to 45 more homeless people during the 
cold-weather months. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45 winter residents sleep on cots in the shelter's dining room and receive 
hot meals and warm clothing. They must leave the premises each morning and seek 
readmittance each evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter prohibits weapons, drugs and alcohol. In addition, said manager 
Jeri Darr, "We make it clear to people here that we are not going to hide them 
from the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some Lancaster officials feared the shelter would attract homeless 
people from distant communities, Darr says 95% of the people aided by the 
shelter have come from the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Johnston, 52, entered the shelter in September, about a month after he 
lost his house in Palmdale. Johnston lost his job in the grocery industry last 
year and fell behind in paying his bills. "I had to file for bankruptcy," he 
said. "I had to give up the house and car." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston has several goals while staying at the shelter. "I'm going to find 
another job," he said. "I'm going to get back to work and get a smaller house 
and a car." 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley Blackwell, 56, who has been at the shelter for five months, says he 
operated a crane and drove trucks before heart problems and diabetes left him 
unable to continue working. He hopes to move out of the shelter when his 
disability checks arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get all kinds of people here," Blackwell said. "A lot of them have 
drinking and drug problems. Some have family problems. Some have mental 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for this shelter, a lot of people wouldn't make it. I've seen a 
lot of people come through and get their lives together. And some don't, 
because they don't want to get their lives together." 
</P>
<P>
 To increase the number of shelter clients who move on to full-time work, the 
facility has applied for a grant that would pay for one more employee. This 
specialist would prepare the homeless for employment and help find local jobs 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodio's suggestion that the city cut its ties to the shelter drew no immediate 
response from Catholic Charities. But representatives of the group said they 
plan to talk to city officials about continuing the current cooperative 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Lancaster needs to be commended for being willing to look at the 
problem of homelessness head-on," Darr said. "They've got this facility, and 
they've got this problem that no one wants to talk about. Homelessness is not 
pretty."

MIKE DOWNEY: MAYBE WE SHOULD PETITION FOR A RECALL OF L.A. FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Vote today: Proposition 287. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who starts a fight at a football game can be kicked out of the state 
of California and made to move to the other 49 states, Mexico or Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Man, if this was the last Los Angeles vs. Los Angeles contest in NFL history, 
say a little prayer. Be thankful nobody got killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing new meaning to the phrase "Beat L.A.!" spectators galore got punched 
and kicked as though they were Rodney King or Reginald Denny. At last report: 
14 arrested, 55 ejected. Plus, both of the starting quarterbacks were driven 
from the football field on golf carts to go have X-rays. Plus, both of their 
replacements were sent sprawling by cheap shots that drew penalties for 
unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is football, not boxing," a plaintive Anthony Newman of the Rams said 
when Sunday's civil war mercifully ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Shane Conlan was so aggrieved by what he saw happening in the Anaheim 
Stadium grandstand, he said: "I felt like putting on my stuff (equipment) and 
going up there. People spend a lot of money to bring their families and they 
can't watch the game because some pathetic idiots want to fight. They need to 
get a life." 
</P>
<P>
 Precious few of these pathetic idiots were from out of state. Alas, these were 
our pathetic idiots. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an idea: 
</P>
<P>
 Let's keep the Raiders and Rams here and send Oakland and St. Louis the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, well. This concludes another special Sunday here in the land of spilled 
milk and funny honey. We finally get a nice turnout and look what happens. We 
get blacked out of the Cowboy-49er game on TV. Our own game develops into a 
mishmash of broken plays, broken players, insensitive people and senseless 
penalties. And everyone lived unhappily ever after. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost in the process was some newfangled play-calling by the Raiders that was 
more than welcome, some eyebrow-raising strategy by the Rams that included 21 
consecutive pass calls, some pinpoint accuracy by Jeff Hostetler and Chris 
Chandler before they got knocked into La-La Land, some clutch kicking by Jeff 
Jaeger and at least 60,000 spectators who did not get handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest itself was slapdash but spirited, with the Raiders defeating the 
Rams by the exact same score, 20-17, of their 1991 game at the Coliseum. Who 
knows when or where their paths will cross again? Live long and prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 Should have been a nice day, this one. 
</P>
<P>
 It was such a pleasure to see a full house. To see traffic on Katella that was 
not headed for an amusement park. To see the Raiders come to their senses and 
begin doing imaginative things with the football (although, when Jaeger makes a 
field goal and gives them three points, perhaps the Raiders had better keep the 
three, even if their opponents do commit a penalty that gives them a first 
down). 
</P>
<P>
 At crunch time, it was still Tim Brown who came up with shoestring catches 
that kept drives alive. But guess what? Rocket Ismail, James Jett, Jamie 
Williams, Andrew Glover -- look! They finally got their hands on the old 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was no tea party, as Vince Evans and Chris Miller discovered when 
they were summoned to replace Hostetler and Chandler. Possibly as payback, 
Evans got bulldogged out of bounds by the Rams' Fred Stokes, one series after 
Miller took a pop in the chops near his own bench from the Raiders' Jerry Ball. 
It got nasty out there. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler, though, said, "They were playing clean and hard, trying to make 
things happen. I didn't see anything other than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Except up in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 There might never be another NFL game, L.A. vs. L.A., and that would be a low 
down dirty shame. Let's hope these two football teams stick around, if only to 
offer collateral for all of their loyal customers who are out on bail. 
</P>
<P>
 If we do lose football here, we will have these people to blame/thank. But 
what can be done? You can't penalize customers for unsportsmanlike conduct. 
Businesses can't refuse to sell tickets to people who might cause trouble. You 
can't round up the usual suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Greater Los Angeles has a situation on its hands not unlike Europe's with 
soccer hooligans, and anyone with potential solutions is hereby invited to 
shout them out, or propose a ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, all the public can do with these games is what the athletes do. 
Take them one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 * UNRULY BEHAVIOR: Police counted at least 26 altercations and arrested 14 
people during the game. C11.

MISSING MEMORIES; '54 BRUINS MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEST EVER, BUT THEY DIDN'T REACH 
THE ROSE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best football team UCLA ever had never played in a bowl game. The only 
undefeated, untied team in Bruin football history, coached by the shrewd, 
tormented, unpredictable Red Sanders, played like no team from Westwood ever 
has, splattering opponents to the far reaches of the Coliseum and launching 
memories like confetti, still falling to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1954, UCLA went 9-0, outscored its opponents 367-40, fielded three 
first-team All-Americans, sent 14 players to the pros and was voted national 
champion by United Press International. 
</P>
<P>
 There were only two problems. The Associated Press picked Ohio State No. 1 and 
the Pacific Coast Conference kept UCLA out of the Rose Bowl. USC, which lost, 
34-0, to UCLA, went instead and got drummed by Ohio State, 20-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, it was a banner Bruin year. A little thing called the 
no-repeat rule tripped up UCLA and sent the Bruins sprawling. The Pacific Coast 
Conference started it in 1952, basically so the conference wouldn't have to 
begin each year with California getting blown out in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference's no-repeat Rose Bowl rule lasted eight years. As fate would 
have it, the only team affected in the rule's short life was the 1954 UCLA 
Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a strange deal," said Terry Debay, 61, the Bruins' quarterback from 
Canoga Park in Sanders' single-wing formation. "But that was the way it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was strange, but it didn't take 40 years for the Bruins of 1954 to 
come to terms with missing out on the Rose Bowl, probably because they feel 
they didn't miss much of anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds almost like a cliche. They were a tight-knit bunch, all right, but 
they won too, all the while feeling strangely surrounded by this feeling that 
they were something special, something unusual, something bigger than the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, you'd better believe it," said tailback Primo Villanueva, 62, the 
"Calexico Kid" from Mexico. "Individually, we couldn't fight our way out of a 
paper bag, with some exceptions. But as a unit, there was a bond. . . . I've 
never seen anything like it before or since." 
</P>
<P>
 And 40 years later, the Bruins' best will hold a reunion Friday night at the 
Verdugo Club in Glendale. Many of them plan to be there, including Debay, a 
real estate broker in Newport Beach, and Bob Davenport, 61, the hard-running 
All-American fullback from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport, who runs a bicycle touring business in Upland, Ind., is looking 
forward to seeing his old teammates as much as, say, the way he slammed into 
the line against Stanford at the Coliseum back in '54 when UCLA won, 72-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I think about when I see the guys is that it's probably the last time 
we'll see each other this side of heaven," Davenport said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All UCLA guys go to heaven, you know. There won't be any USC guys there, 
though . . . and there won't be many officials, either." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Westwood in 1954, it was a time of heaven on earth. Sanders, a brilliant 
tactician on the practice field and the sideline, was in his coaching prime. At 
49, he was in his sixth season at UCLA after six years as coach at Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders assembled a notable staff in 1954 at UCLA, a group that included back 
coach Tommy Prothro and line coach Jim Myers. The coaching staff preached 
discipline, fundamentals and knocking the stuffing out of everybody who crossed 
their path. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Tobin, a reporter who covered the 1954 Bruins for the Los Angeles Mirror, 
was impressed all over again every day by what Sanders had put together. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just dominated everybody," Tobin said. "They blew people away." 
</P>
<P>
 They did it with a stifling defense that still holds school records for fewest 
yards and fewest points allowed. UCLA opponents averaged 4.4 points a game in 
1954 and were outscored by an average of 36.4 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sanders' offense set a school record for points that lasted until 
1973. They won by such scores as 67-0, 72-0, 61-0, 41-0 and 34-0. The only team 
that came close to beating UCLA was Washington, which lost, 21-20, the 
difference a missed extra point. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders' offensive scheme was the single wing, which resembles today's shotgun 
formation. The ball usually was snapped to Villanueva, the tailback, who also 
called the signals. Debay was a blocking back as quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a simple yet effective strategy. When critics in the newspapers dubbed 
the UCLA attack the "horse and buggy" offense, they had to change the name 
after the blowouts. Soon, newspapers dubbed it the "hearse and buggy" offense, 
because it was killing the other teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look back at it, it was almost a Woody Hayes mentality," Davenport 
said. "You do it right, you do it consistently. It doesn't matter how familiar 
defenses are with you, you could tell them where you are going because you 
overpower them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd stand out there for hours at practice just doing simple steps, six-inch 
steps, like ballet. It was a few things done so well we didn't have to think 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't as though UCLA was starting from scratch in 1954. The Bruins were 
8-2 in 1953 and got to the Rose Bowl, in which they lost to Michigan State, 
28-20. When 1954 spring practice began, the Bruins started preparing for what 
would be their greatest season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Bogosian said that even then, the players felt it was going to be nothing 
less than spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogosian, 62, a guard from Fresno, is in the service contracting business in 
Los Angeles after a coaching career that included two Super Bowls as a line 
coach with the Raiders. There was something wonderful about the UCLA party 
line, right then and there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day of practice, I knew we were going to be a great football team," 
he said. "We all did. You could feel it in your bones, your head and your 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches made them feel it too. Sanders, Prothro and Myers were icons to 
the young players. Villanueva and Davenport said they commanded a type of 
respect rare in modern coach-player relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were gods," Villanueva said. "Sanders was god and the assistant coaches 
were his disciples. If I saw a coach right now, I couldn't call him by his 
first name if my life depended on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bogosian said he remains close to Myers, 73, who is retired after 25 years as 
an assistant coach with the Dallas Cowboys. Bogosian said he started calling 
Myers by his first name two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a privilege," Bogosian said. "I learned everything I know from Jim 
Myers." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides all the football lessons taught him by Prothro, Davenport said he 
learned something else from him: fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "He scared the poop out of me," Davenport said. "He was bigger than a house to 
us. And Jim Myers, just meaner than sin." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers was baking cookies in his home in Dallas when he was asked about how 
mean he actually was coaching the 1954 team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you know, you got to have a little of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders wasn't mean, just complicated. A scholar and a literate man, Sanders 
had a darker side that he battled most of his adult life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a fine coach," said Prothro, 74, who lives in Memphis, Tenn., and is 
battling cancer. "I don't know how to say this, but he was one of the finest 
men I have ever known when he didn't have alcohol in him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, who died in 1958, was an intellectual. Tobin remembers bus rides when 
Sanders would look out the window and win bets from other members of the 
traveling party on what type of architecture they were seeing. He was also a 
keen judge of football talent. He found Milt Davis, who became an All-Pro 
defensive back, playing touch football on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a most amazing guy," Myers said. "I was raised up in football under 
General (Bob) Neyland (at Tennessee), but the other two big influences I had 
were Red Sanders and Tom Landry. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just had great timing, good judgment and the intuition to do the right 
thing at the right time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said that Sam Brown, a kick return specialist and safety from McClymonds 
High School in Oakland, learned something first-hand about the acuity of 
Sanders' timing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Old Sam, he always switched the ball back and forth from one hand to the 
other when he was running back punts," Myers said. "Red said one day at 
practice 'If you ever switch that ball again, you're out of here.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the next game was against Stanford and Sam ran two punts back for 
touchdowns, switching hands like crazy, and we win, 72-0. The next week at 
practice, Red never said a word." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 61, teaches fourth and fifth grades at Grant Elementary School in Santa 
Monica. He does not switch hands when he writes on the chalkboard. Neither does 
he switch his opinion that the Bruins would have done quite well if they had 
been permitted to play in the 1955 Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such a great time if we had gone, the way our guys were hitting, we 
would have destroyed anybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't get the chance. The Bruins' 34-0 victory over a USC team led by 
Jon Arnett and Lindon Crow, before 102,548 at the Coliseum, was UCLA's last 
game of the season. It was a festive day for UCLA, beginning when a Bruin fan 
in a Trojan uniform rode into the Coliseum on a mule waving a toy sword. 
</P>
<P>
 Most USC observers found nothing about the game even remotely amusing. It was 
the second-worst defeat in USC history, a fact that did not escape Trojan Coach 
Jess Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're No. 1 in the nation as far as I'm concerned," Hill said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 In the UPI coaches' poll, UCLA was No. 1 with 328 points and Ohio State was 
No. 2 with 321 points. The AP writers' poll had 9-0 Ohio State No. 1 with 3,670 
points and UCLA No. 2 with 3,594 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins were not allowed to try to make up the 74-point difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew the rules," Prothro said. "I don't think it upset us a whole lot. Now 
that I look back on it, I know what kind of team we had. Relative to its time, 
I think it's the best college team I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Villanueva, who lives in Vancouver and owns a business that produces chips and 
salsa, said there's no doubt in his mind that the team he played for was the 
best in the nation. And, like Bogosian, he had to accept the effect of the 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a matter of life, it was a matter of fact," Bogosian said. "It just 
wasn't meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The team said goodby to the 1954 season at the awards banquet, held Dec. 9 in 
the Crystal Room of the Beverly Hills Hotel. Phil Harris was the toastmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 They say hello again to each other Friday night. John Peterson, 61, captain of 
the 1954 team, put together the reunion. He was from University High and played 
center and linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, who owns two car dealerships in Los Angeles, said what was lost 
still drives him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always felt we were the best team, but we never had the opportunity to 
prove it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This sense of loss may be a topic of discussion at the reunion. Then again, 
maybe not. Jack Ellena, 63, an All-American tackle from Susanville, Calif., 
only wants to see his old friends again. He said it's going to be a special 
time, all right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure we'll take up right where we left off," he said. "When we're 
together, time stands still."

MORNING BRIEFING: AFTER 90 YEARS, BASEBALL STORIES SOUND THE SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The headline "Salary Slicing: The American League Is Treating Its Players 
Fairly, But Will Not Submit to Hold-ups by Players" has a contemporary ring to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The article was dated Feb. 11, 1905, in the weekly newspaper "Sporting Life." 
</P>
<P>
 In it, American League president Ban Johnson was quoted: "Both (major) leagues 
have clubs who cannot afford to pay heavy salaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds a lot like Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
 Add salaries: According to the Amateur Athletic Foundation's Newsletter, what 
prompted Johnson to speak out was a demand from center fielder Mike Mitchell, 
who said he would accept "not less than $2,000" to sign with the Chicago Cubs 
after helping Syracuse win the New York League title in 1904. The Cubs were 
offering $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell stayed in the minors two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's scale: Rafael Belliard signed a $1.1 million contract with the Atlanta 
Braves even though he failed to hit a home run or steal a base in 120 at bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Only three players in the last 50 years have hit .340 six times. 
Who are they? 
</P>
<P>
 The way it is: Commenting on the reopening of Seattle's Kingdome, after roof 
repairs were completed, The Oregonian's Dwight Jaynes observed: "About $30 
million later, the building is open again -- and as ugly as ever. Inside, the 
place still looks like the belly of a cement mixer. Outside, well, it's 
probably more ghastly than ever. If your roof looked as filthy and unsightly as 
this one, the neighbors would get up a petition to have you run out of town." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse sense: Steve Carlton, the Philadelphia Phillies' Hall of Fame pitcher, 
refused to talk to reporters during most of his career. Now retired on his 
ranch in Colorado, Carlton has a favorite horse named Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rio's just like me," Carlton said in a recent interview. "He's very 
independent. He doesn't cooperate with the media whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 A winner: Chris McSorley, brother of King forward Marty McSorley, might have 
been the most successful coach in America the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, he coached the Toledo Storm to the East Coast Hockey League title and 
then led the Anaheim Bullfrogs to the inaugural Roller Hockey International 
championship. This year he repeated with Toledo in the ECHL and then guided the 
Buffalo Stampede to the RHI title. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not through. He's currently coaching the Las Vegas Thunder in the 
International Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: San Francisco 49er quarterback Steve Young plays tennis left-handed and 
golf right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 Double threat: Atlanta Brave pitcher Greg Maddox not only won a third 
consecutive Cy Young Award, he also outhit his opposition. Maddox had a batting 
average of .222, while National League hitters managed only .207 against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Ted Williams, Stan Musial and Wade Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Jack Haley of the San Antonio Spurs, on controversial teammate 
Dennis Rodman, in the San Jose Mercury News: "Dennis is very stable and 
extremely intelligent. He understands completely what he's doing. I don't think 
by any shape or form that he has a psychological or mental problem." SHAV GLICK

PREP FOOTBALL / SOUTHERN SECTION PAIRINGS; THREE UNBEATEN TEAMS TOP DIVISION I 
FIELD FOR PLAYOFFS 
</P>

<P>
 La Puente Bishop Amat High opens the Southern Section Division I playoffs 
Friday night as the top-seeded team, but it will have a difficult time 
maintaining its perfect record. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-team Division I field, announced with the section's other 10 divisions 
Sunday, is one of the most balanced in years.It includes two other 10-0 teams 
-- second-seeded Santa Ana Mater Dei and third-seeded Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Jordan (7-3) is seeded fourth after winning a three-way tiebreaker 
with Long Beach Poly (9-1) and Lakewood (6-4) for the Moore League title. 
</P>
<P>
 Several unseeded teams could also challenge for the title, including Loyola 
(7-2), Anaheim Esperanza (7-3) and Fontana (7-3). Esperanza appeared to have 
received a favorable draw, but there is a strong possibility of meeting Bishop 
Amat, The Times' top-ranked team all season, in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have to play Mater Dei in the second round, that's the kind of year 
it is," said Loyola Coach Steve Grady. "This division is loaded." 
</P>
<P>
 Noticeably absent is Santa Fe Springs St. Paul, a 7-3 team rated No. 9 in the 
Southland by The Times last week. The Swordsmen finished fifth in the Del Rey 
League, which sent its top four teams to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at the bracket and wonder what happened to St. Paul?" said Bill 
Clark, Southern Section associate commissioner in charge of the football 
playoffs. "But we can't take a fifth-place team. That's a tough break." 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs begin Friday and continue with the quarterfinals Nov. 25, the 
semifinals Dec. 2-3 and the finals Dec. 9-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark announced Sunday that the Division I championship will be held on 
Saturday, Dec. 10 at Cerritos College, instead of its usual Friday night slot 
at Anaheim Stadium. It will be televised by Channel 13, KCOP-TV.

 WHO NEEDS AIKMAN VS. YOUNG WHEN YOU HAVE CONWAY? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was that swirling Florida storm and those wobbly Steve Walsh flutter 
balls. Maybe it was the karma of all us Los Angelenos grumbling under our 
breaths because the Dolphin-Bear game was the one that The Powers That TV 
substituted when the 49er-Cowboy game was yanked off of our tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, if you watched the Bears' 17-14 victory at Miami, you saw a bizarro 
classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the 49er-Cowboy game was the best matchup of this regular season, but 
did it feature a fake field goal gone horrendously wrong that ended up as a 
pretty touchdown pass thrown by a wide receiver (Curtis Conway), tipped away 
from an eligible offensive lineman (Jerry Fontenot) and caught by a little-used 
tight end (Keith Jennings)? 
</P>
<P>
 Miami reacted well to Chicago's split formation. Conway, lined up 15 yards to 
the left of the holder and kicker, took the shovel snap from center and rolled 
to his right, evaded Bryan Cox and adjusted when primary receiver Marv Cook was 
covered by hurling a spiral across the field toward Fontenot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw two of our guys out there, and two of their guys," Conway said. "Our 
guys were bigger, so I just decided I'd throw it up there and hope that one of 
our guys would go up and get it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a game that had a perfect Donnell Woolford interception in the end zone 
nullified by a bad call and ruled incomplete, a game that had Woolford's long 
interception return earlier in the game made irrelevant by his fumble back to 
the Dolphins on the play, a game in which Dolphin kicker Pete Stoyanovich left 
Don Shula stewing on the sidelines by drilling a line drive that got nicked at 
the line in his attempt to kick a field goal and send the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bear kicker Kevin Butler, who, upon last examination tackled no one, did 
kick the field goal that put Chicago ahead for good: "We fought, scratched and 
clawed to get in a position to win. Anytime I can get in and help them win, I'm 
ready." THE GREAT BLAKE 
</P>
<P>
 While the NFC was displaying its muddle of struggling young quarterbacks, the 
other conference showcased a potential new generation of heroes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The find of the season so far? Easily, it's the Cincinnati Bengals' Jeff 
Blake, an unknown until David Klinger's wobbliness and injuries drove him to 
the sidelines. Blake had his second consecutive brilliant game. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, the 166th selection in the 1992 draft, led the Bengals to a 34-31 
victory over the Oilers by throwing for 354 yards and the first four-touchdown 
performance by a Cincinnati quarterback since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, who threw for 387 yards last week in only his second NFL start last 
week in a victory over the Seahawks, bounced off the X-ray table on Sunday to 
lead two late drives on his bruised left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bengal fans have caught on to the exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Videos, jerseys, everything around here this week has been No. 8," said 
receiver Carl Pickens, who caught two of Blake's touchdown passes. "Everything 
is Jeff Blake, and why not? He deserves it." JUST LIKE THEY DREW IT UP 
</P>
<P>
 Lost in Blake's wake, but not in the history books, was New England's Drew 
Bledsoe, who kept throwing and throwing after struggling to produce points the 
previous five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Firing at will after trailing, 20-3, at halftime, Bledsoe completed 45 passes 
in 70 attempts -- both NFL records -- in the Patriots' 26-20 overtime victory 
over the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 The old records were 68 passes by Houston's George Blanda on Nov. 1, 1964 and 
42 completions by the New York Jets' Richard Todd on Sept. 21, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe threw for 426 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when we were ahead, we never were able to take him out of his rhythm 
entirely," Minnesota Coach Dennis Green said. TONIGHT'S GAME: BUFFALO AT 
PITTSBURGH 
</P>
<P>
 6 p.m., Channel 7 
</P>
<P>
 Time is running out on the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Miami's loss to Chicago on Sunday, Buffalo could suffer 
difficult-to-reverse damage to its playoff hopes if it doesn't win tonight. The 
Bills (5-4) have as many losses as they did all last season, and they have two 
losses to the team with which they are tied for the last wild-card spot: the 
Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Still ahead are games against the Packers, Lions (on Thanksgiving), Dolphins, 
Vikings, Patriots and Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Thurman Thomas has been the key. The Bills have been great when 
Thomas has played well and they have played poorly when he has struggled. 
Otherwise, the Bills have been average in every phase of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers are very fortunate to be 6-3. They were very average and needed 
four field goals to beat the Oilers last week. They, too, have the easiest part 
of their schedule behind them. They've played the Oilers twice and the Giants 
and Bengals, but down the line are the Dolphins, Eagles, Raiders, Browns and 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Steeler running back Barry Foster might not play because of a knee injury. Bam 
Morris has been an adequate replacement. Steeler quarterback Neil O'Donnell has 
a sprained ankle, but is expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Steelers dominated the Bills in a Monday night game, 23-0. 
Pittsburgh controlled the ball for nearly 45 minutes. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-yard fourth-quarter touchdown pass from Miami's Dan Marino to Keith 
Jackson was the 20th of the season for Marino. It is the 11th time Marino has 
thrown at least 20 touchdown passes, an NFL record. . . . Seven of the last 
nine games between Kansas City and San Diego have been decided by four points 
or less. . . . Dan Saleaumua of the Chiefs made the 16th fumble recovery of his 
career, breaking the team record he had shared with Bobby Bell, Willie Lanier 
and Deron Cherry. . . . You're out of the will: The loss to Chicago was the 
first ever for Miami Coach Don Shula to a team for which one of his sons was 
coaching. Shula's son, Mike, is Chicago's tight end coach. Shula has a 6-1 mark 
in such contests. . . . It was the Bears' first victory in Miami, leaving New 
England as the only site at which they have never won. . . . Think of the poor 
guy he cut in front of: John Drndak of Vero Beach, Fla., became the 10 
millionth person to attend an event at Joe Robbie Stadium and was presented 
with prizes worth more than $20,000, including a trip to Europe and two tickets 
to every event in the stadium in 1995, including January's Super Bowl. . . . Oh 
yeah, these two have a lot in common: Saint quarterback Jim Everett needed 11 
yards entering the game to reach 26,000 career passing yards. He finished with 
276 and his two touchdown passes gave him 156 for his career, tying him with 
Hall of Famer Roger Staubach. . . . Miami's Irving Fryar equaled a career high 
with nine receptions. . . . Cleveland (8-2) has allowed the fewest points (118) 
in the NFL, an 11.8 average per game. The Browns have allowed an NFL low 13 
touchdowns. It's the Browns best start since 1965, when they started 10-2 and 
finished 11-3 on their way to the NFC title game against Green Bay. Cleveland 
remains the only NFL team not to allow a 100-yard rusher or a 100-yard 
receiver. . . . Carl Pickens became the first Bengal receiver to catch three 
touchdowns in a game since Cris Collinsworth in 1986. . . . Before Jeff Blake 
on Sunday, Boomer Esiason was the last Bengal to throw for four touchdowns in a 
game -- also against Houston in 1989. . . . Barry Sanders became the first 
running back to rush for 200 yards against Tampa Bay since Eric Dickerson 
gained 207 yards for the Rams on Oct. 5, 1986. . . . Rookie Mario Bates of the 
Saints ran for 141 yards in his first start after sitting out six weeks because 
of a broken jaw suffered in a barroom scuffle with teammate Lorenzo Neal. 
QUACK, QUACK 
</P>
<P>
 If it looks like a duck and sounds like a duck, it's probably being thrown by 
an NFC quarterback not named Troy Aikman, Brett Favre, Randall Cunningham, 
Warren Moon or Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
 As the NFC playoff picture solidifies, it's the dependable, established 
quarterbacks who are bringing their teams home strongly -- and the shaky, 
breaky guys who are sending their teams into December panic time. 
</P>
<P>
 If things remain as they stand after play Sunday, the above-mentioned five 
quarterbacks will lead the Cowboys, Packers, Eagles, Vikings and 49ers, 
respectively, into the playoffs, and right now, the Bears, with Steve Walsh 
still undefeated as a starter this year, are tied with Green Bay for the final 
two wild-card spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond these six teams, all 6-4 or better, nobody else has a quarterback who 
can move the ball consistently -- and none has a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bunch including Atlanta's star-crossed Jeff George, Detroit veteran 
Dave Krieg, the Rams' Chris Miller, the Giants' Kent Graham and Dave Brown, Jim 
Everett of New Orleans and Steve Beuerlein of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 George, for example, started 1994 off nicely, throwing 11 touchdowns in his 
first six games. But as the pressure has been ratcheted up, his numbers have 
taken a dive: In the last four games, George has thrown for only three scores 
(one Sunday in the loss to the Saints), and the pass-dependent Falcons have 
gone 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFC's surprise star is Walsh, who has stepped in for Bear free-agent 
millionaire Erik Kramer this year and conjured five victories in five 
statistically bland starts, including this Sunday's 188-yard outing. MORTEN TO 
THE RESCUE -- AGAIN 
</P>
<P>
 What are the New Orleans Saints going to do when Morten Andersen retires? 
Probably lose many close games. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen beat the Atlanta Falcons Sunday with a game-winning field goal for 
the sixth time in his career -- including four of the last five games between 
the two teams -- giving the Saints a 33-32 comeback victory and overshadowing 
the six field goals by Atlanta's Norm Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Andersen's game winner was a 39-yarder with eight seconds to play, 
capping a rally from a 20-3 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any play is big when you win a game with it," Andersen said. "The NFL is all 
about making big plays when they count. Both sides did that today, we just did 
it once more." INJURY REPORT 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia Eagles took a major hit, losing star middle linebacker Byron 
Evans, the team's leading tackler, because of a fractured right leg in the 
second quarter against Cleveland. Evans, one of the last remaining holdovers 
from the glory days of the Eagles' defense, is out for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati Bengal running back Steve Broussard was in the hospital Sunday 
night undergoing tests after he hurt his neck and experienced numbness during 
the game against Houston. Broussard went down while making a block with four 
minutes to play. He felt numbness in his arms and legs and was taken off the 
field on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronco receiver Derek Russell was treated and released from the hospital after 
straining some neck muscles and bruising his spinal column making a tackle on 
an interception against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay Packer receiver Sterling Sharpe left the game with a hamstring 
injury after extending his receptions streak to 97 consecutive games with a 
13-yard catch. He left the game late in the third quarter, finishing with only 
the one catch. It was only the 12th catch in the last four games for Sharpe, 
who led the NFL in receptions the last two seasons, including a record 112 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 New England Patriot linebacker Todd Collins suffered a torn knee ligament. . . 
. Cleveland Brown cornerback Antonio Langham strained his left knee.

BENGALS' BLAKE ONE TOUGH TIGER; AFC: DESPITE SPRAINED ANKLE, QUARTERBACK 
RALLIES CINCINNATI TO A 34-31 VICTORY OVER HOUSTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jeff Blake bounded out of the X-ray room to lead the Cincinnati Bengals to a 
dramatic 34-31 victory over the Houston Oilers on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Limping severely on a sprained ankle, Blake led the Bengals on two scoring 
drives in the final three minutes, the second leading to Doug Pelfrey's 40-yard 
game-winning field goal as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 A 33-yard pass to Carl Pickens set up Pelfrey's kick. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers (1-9) thought they'd seen the last of the third-string quarterback 
making his third NFL start when he was carted off for X-rays on his left ankle 
in the fourth quarter. The Oilers went on to take a 31-24 lead while doctors 
checked Blake for torn ligaments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blake, again riding a cart, came back in the nick of time, carefully 
stepped off the cart and rescued the Bengals (2-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, a former New York Jet who was the 166th pick in the 1992 draft, passed 
for 387 yards in a 20-17 overtime victory over the Seattle Seahawks last week 
after almost upsetting the Dallas Cowboys in his first start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't coming out," Blake said. "They were going to have to drag me off. My 
ankle was sprained and every time I got hit I aggravated it. But I was able to 
come to the sideline, cool down and go back out and play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers (1-9) were on the verge of breaking their losing streak, now at six 
games, when Billy Joe Tolliver threw a five-yard touchdown pass to Webster 
Slaughter for a 31-24 lead with 5:51 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Pickens made a one-handed catch and dragged two tacklers into the end 
zone for a game-tying 21-yard touchdown reception with 2:34 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake finished 23 of 33 for 354 yards and four touchdowns. Turning It Around

BLEDSOE -- 45 OF 70 -- HAS A RECORD DAY; INTERCONFERENCE: PATRIOT QUARTERBACK 
FINISHES IT OFF WITH OVERTIME TOUCHDOWN PASS TO DEFEAT VIKINGS, 26-20.

 Drew Bledsoe threw and threw and threw some more. Finally, he threw his arms 
up in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 He had plenty to celebrate Sunday after his 45th completion and 70th pass -- 
both NFL records -- settled into fullback Kevin Turner's arms in the end zone 
4:10 into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-yard pass gave the struggling New England Patriots a 26-20 victory over 
the Minnesota Vikings, one of the NFL's best teams. And it capped a stunning 
comeback from a 20-0 deficit and a first half in which the Patriots were 
outgained, 286 yards to 89. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe, who completed all six of his passes on the winning drive, barely had 
time to raise his arms over his head before he was engulfed by jubilant 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we've got a bunch of guys feeling pretty good," Patriot Coach Bill 
Parcells said. "It was a valiant effort. We were on the ropes big time." 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe passed for 426 yards and three touchdowns but took his historic 
performance in stride, just as he didn't despair over the seven passes he had 
intercepted in his last two games, both losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely is a vindication (after) all the people wrote this one in the 
books as a win for the Vikings," he said. "I'm not going to get too high after 
a game like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots (4-6) ended a four-game losing streak and stopped the four-game 
winning streak of the Vikings, who still lead the NFC Central with a 7-3 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 "This loss brings us down to earth if anybody here has been floating," said 
Warren Moon, who passed for 234 yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bledsoe did much better in the second half, completing 37 of 53 passes for 
354 yards, as the Patriots switched to a no-huddle offense for almost the 
entire half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings, who were tied for third in the NFL with 27 sacks, didn't get to 
Bledsoe once. 
</P>
<P>
 He broke NFL records of 68 passes by Houston's George Blanda on Nov. 1, 1964, 
and 42 completions by the New York Jets' Richard Todd on Sept. 21, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, the Patriots were trailing, 20-3, and had gone 10 quarters 
without a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota still led, 20-10, with less than three minutes to play in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Bledsoe passed five yards to Leroy Thompson for a touchdown with 2:21 to 
play. The Vikings couldn't get a first down on their next series, and Bledsoe 
led the Patriots from their 39-yard line to Matt Bahr's tying 23-yard field 
goal with 14 seconds remaining. Passing Fancy

SANDERS (237 YARDS) STEALS SHOW; NFC: HE COMES THROUGH WITH BEST GAME AS A PRO 
TO LEAD THE LIONS OVER BUCCANEERS, 14-9. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Barry Sanders almost defies description. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tampa Bay rookie Errict Rhett gave it a try after the Detroit Lions' 14-9 
victory over the Buccaneers Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only can I not do the things Barry does, I can't even describe them," 
Rhett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, the NFL's leading rusher, had his best game as a pro against the 
Buccaneers, rushing 26 times for a career-high 237 yards -- an even 200 in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the second game of more than 200 yards for Sanders; the other came 
in 1991 when he ran for 220 against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 "God ain't made a better back in this lifetime," Lion Coach Wayne Fontes said. 
"Maybe one will come along someday. But it hasn't happened yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders has rushed for 100 yards or more eight times against the Buccaneers. 
In the last five, Sanders had burned the Buccaneers for 122, 130, 187, 166 and 
237 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders now leads the NFL with 1,319 yards. This is Sanders' best 10-game 
start of his career. His best start prior to this season came in 1993, when he 
gained 1,052 yards after his first 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 At this rate, he is on pace to gain 2,110 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say I never think about it," Sanders said. "But it's not part of my 
game preparation. I don't want to complicate things any more than they already 
are. It would be wonderful to reach that mark. But I'm determined not to go 
into each game focusing on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders needed the big night to keep from being upstaged by Rhett, who rushed 
25 times for 112 yards. It was the first time a Tampa Bay runner gained more 
than 100 since Reggie Cobb ran for 113 against Detroit on Oct. 3, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fifth consecutive loss for Tampa Bay (2-8). 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions, behind the running of Sanders and passing of Dave Krieg, scored two 
touchdowns in the third quarter, one on a one-yard run by Derrick Moore and the 
other on a nine-yard pass by Krieg to Herman Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 Krieg completed five of 13 passes for 99 yards and one touchdown. Running Wild

HOSTETLER FINDS HE HAS OTHER OPTIONS; INTERCONFERENCE: INSTEAD OF FINDING ONLY 
BROWN, QUARTERBACK SPREADS HIS PASSES AROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, there are other receivers on the Raiders besides Tim Brown. And other 
numbers besides No. 81. And other options besides Brown streaking across the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
 There are Rocket Ismail and James Jett and Alexander Wright and Andrew Glover 
and even Jamie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, quarterback Jeff Hostetler always knew that. He just didn't know 
how to find them. Not with a 295-pound defender rushing into his face and 
another breathing down his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when Hostetler was chased and pounded and pummeled in the past, he did 
what any sane quarterback in his position would do. He looked for his first 
option, his most reliable option, the man he knew would be open. He looked for 
Tim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't sound like a bad idea in theory. In fact, Brown had caught 50 
passes before Sunday's 20-17 victory over the Rams, for 742 yards and six 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was too much of a good thing. The Raiders had become predictable and 
one-dimensional, with a passing game that caused defenses to lick their chops 
in anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, Brown was the only wide receiver to catch a pass. The rest of the 
wide receivers had combined for only 33 catches all year. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed Sunday. Brown caught five passes. But Ismail caught two, one 
going for a touchdown, and Jett caught two after catching none in his previous 
five games and only one in his last seven. Glover, the starting tight end, 
caught a touchdown pass, and Williams made his first catch of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference? 
</P>
<P>
 Time. Time for Hostetler to pass, time for the receivers to get open and time 
for the tight ends to get into their patterns because the Rams didn't blitz 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot afford to go into the game and depend totally on Tim," Raider Coach 
Art Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 No argument from Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy everybody was able to get into the game and make some plays," he 
said. "We ran the same plays this week that we ran last week. It's all about 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at the film this week, and they can't just say, 'We've got to 
stop Tim Brown.' There are other guys who can get the ball in the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that Brown doesn't want the ball. What receiver worth his salary 
wouldn't want the quarterback to look his way? 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the ball 10 times a game if I can get it," he said. "But I don't want 
every time we drop back, they're throwing the ball to me. I don't want that. I 
told Art Shell and (offensive coordinator) Tom Walsh and (receiver coach) Fred 
Biletnikoff, 'You guys know I want the ball, but if you're throwing it to other 
people and they're doing the job, I have no problem with that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On his first touchdown pass Sunday, Hostetler, with a chance to look the field 
over, was able to pick out a secondary option in Glover, who was streaking 
across the field toward the end zone a step ahead of cornerback Wymon 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave him a move to the inside and went to the outside," Glover said of the 
27-yard play, his second touchdown catch of the year. "It was a perfect throw 
by Hostetler." 
</P>
<P>
 And for Glover it was an important catch, not only because it gave the Raiders 
the early lead but because, he believed, it gave the quarterback faith in his 
tight end, who is starting for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has to have confidence in you to throw to you," Glover said of Hostetler. 
"You have to make him feel confident by making the plays. He's risking his 
health standing in there to throw to you." 
</P>
<P>
 When he found Ismail on a 10-yard touchdown pass, Hostetler was going with his 
third option. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had time to do some things," he said. "The guys were working hard. It was 
nice to be able to work some of these things out in a game-type situation." 
</P>
<P>
 It was certainly nice for Jett, who gained 42 yards on his two catches. He had 
a smile on his face Sunday, but it must have been tough to make it through that 
five-game drought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept my head on straight," he said, "and tried to be positive." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders passed for only 218 yards Sunday, but what they lacked in 
explosive power they made up for in the number of targets hit.

DRUNKENNESS, FIGHTING SPOIL GAME FOR MANY; HOOLIGANS: FOURTEEN FANS ARE 
ARRESTED AND 55 EJECTED FROM ANAHEIM STADIUM, BUT NO SERIOUS INJURIES ARE 
REPORTED AT RAM-RAIDER GAME. 
</P>

 Fans of the Rams and Raiders Sunday celebrated what could be their last game 
as cross-town rivals in their customary way. 
</P>
<P>
 They drank and fought. 
</P>
<P>
 Police counted at least 26 altercations and arrested 14 people -- mostly for 
drunkenness and fighting -- during a sold-out football game that drew 65,208 
spectators and was watched as closely for the battles in the stands as on the 
field. Besides those arrested, 55 fans were ejected for unruly behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw men just beating on each other rapid fire," said Rob Harvath, a 
visiting retail analyst who watched the game -- and the fights -- from a luxury 
box. "I've been to several hockey games in St. Louis but never seen crowd 
fights like at the game today." 
</P>
<P>
 The violence, in which no one was seriously injured, might have been worse but 
for the scores of extra police and Anaheim Stadium security personnel placed on 
duty after the last brawl-marred meeting between the teams, a preseason game in 
August during which more than 20 were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, at least, the fighting waited until the start of the game, which 
the Raiders won, 20-17. In August, police reported people were going at it 
during the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The third quarter started turning kind of south," said Sgt. Gerald Stec, who 
heads the Anaheim Police Department's stadium detail. By the fourth quarter, 
officials had turned off the beer spigots to an upper-deck section where as 
many as two dozen people were involved in the afternoon's biggest brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 A clash erupted near the end zone among fans who seemed oblivious to the fact 
that it was a crucial point late in the game and the Rams were about to score 
right in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Stec said the added police presence -- groups of a dozen or more uniformed 
officers were posted near end-zone trouble spots -- helped prevent other large 
fights and kept the mayhem to a minimum. He said police were able to stamp out 
most of the skirmishes quickly and without serious injury to fans. 
</P>
<P>
 First-aid workers reported four to five fight-related injuries, but only one 
of those people was taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a season ticket-holder and I'm disgusted by it," said Ram fan Ed Stevens 
of Costa Mesa, who left the game early with his 11-year-old son after watching 
brawls break out in the stands. "It's notorious -- every time the Rams and 
Raiders get together." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens blamed drinking for the trouble. "I don't think they should serve beer 
when these two teams get together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the cap vendors were steering clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Concessionaire Mike Winn tended a stand high up in the stadium's top level -- 
far away, he hoped, from the kind of scrapping he saw during the August game. 
"There must have been 30 fights," Winn recalled. "I said, put me someplace 
where I can't get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Steed, a Downey iron worker, played down the rivalry between the 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it all boils down to is, this is just a game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just L.A. It's just the L.A. get-together. Ther's enough violence here. 
We don't need any more."

WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY: LEADERSHIP ROLE SOUGHT FOR MINORITIES, WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving toward his self-imposed mandate to press the U.S. Olympic Committee and 
the sports under its umbrella to include more minorities and women in 
leadership positions, USOC President LeRoy Walker appointed separate task 
forces Sunday to address both issues. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent USA Today survey, 46% of athletes in Olympic sports are 
minorities and 42% are women, and yet the national governing bodies for those 
sports have only 10% minority and 26% female representation within their board 
of directors and trustees. As for the USOC, its 101-member board of directors 
includes 13 minorities and 19 women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long before the surveys and the comments from the outside, I knew and felt 
strongly that we needed to tap into as many of these individuals as we could, 
getting them involved," said Walker, who two years ago became the USOC's first 
African-American president. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told these (task force members) I don't just want to hear about the 
problems. I want solutions and ways to implement them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional moment during the USOC's board of directors meeting at the 
Opryland Hotel, the chairman of the Native American Sports Council, Gene 
Keluche, was in tears as he accepted membership for his group into the USOC as 
a community-based, multi-sport organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is a fulfillment of a prophecy of an ancient foretelling, that one day 
we would be standing here to be recognized for our own talents and the 
contributions that we can make to the world," said the NASC's executive 
director, John EagleDay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot be ignored. We cannot be separated. We cannot be denied the 
opportunity for our young people to soar to the heights of their ambitions. 
That's what the Olympics represents." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The USOC is operating with a record $409 million budget for the quadrennium 
that ends with the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. But, without an Olympics in 
the United States to drive marketing efforts during the following four years, 
there are concerns that the next budget might have to be cut by $40 million or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker has suggested that the USOC consider sending less than a full 
complement of qualified athletes to the Olympics as a money-saving measure. 
Despite initial resistance from athletes and officials, many say now that they 
will at least consider it. "It will be a highly charged issue," USOC treasurer 
Sandra Baldwin said. 
</P>

 Just as Mick Jagger said he would not still be singing "Satisfaction" when he 
was 50, British ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean had no thoughts 
of performing to "Bolero" 10 years after their stunning rendition of it won 
them gold medals during the 1984 Winter Olympics at Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 But Torvill and Dean have included that number in their tour that stops next 
Sunday night at the Forum. Also performing is former U.S. and world champion 
Jill Trenary, who married Dean last month.

 Edwin Moses is not making a comeback. There have been numerous reports to the 
contrary since the two-time gold medalist in the 400-meter intermediate hurdles 
said last summer that he would return to competition if he could train without 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are three key words -- train without pain -- that everyone seems to be 
ignoring," he said. "Who can train without pain? Of course, I'm not coming 
back."

 The first half of Bud Greenspan's documentary about the 1994 Winter Olympics, 
"Lillehammer: 16 Days of Glory," will premier Nov. 27 on the Disney Channel. 
Even non-subscribers will be able to see the segment, which peaks with the 
story of speedskater Dan Jansen's emotional triumph in the 1,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The most prominent speedskater of the last decade, Bonnie Blair, announced 
last winter that she will retire after next year's world sprint championships 
in Milwaukee, but not even her agent believes her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing Bonnie, she's going to finish the year and say, 'Let's go for another 
one,' " Helen Wald said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blair insists she has no plans to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of anything that would change my mind," she says. "I'm going to 
have the biggest competition of the season in my own back yard and walk away. 
I've already accomplished more than I ever thought possible, and now there are 
other things I want to do with my life." Notes

 USOC President LeRoy Walker said he would like to see a new executive director 
to replace Harvey Schiller in place before the Pan American Games next March. 
"But we all know that's not possible," Walker said. The end of 1995 is more 
realistic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A search committee has been formed. Early candidates are believed to include 
USOC interim Executive Director John Krimsky, U.S. Skiing President Mike Jacki, 
U.S. Figure Skating Executive Director Jerry Lace, former CBS Sports president 
Neal Pilson, Women's Sports Foundation President Donna Lopiano, former Houston 
Mayor Kathy Whitmire and Liberty Bowl CEO Steve Erhart. . . . Schiller, now 
president of Turner Sports, and Pilson are expected to receive the Olympic 
Order from International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers to honor Wilma Rudolph, the late sprinter's family has 
requested that contributions be sent to The Wilma Rudolph Scholarship Fund, 
P.O. Box 220-82, Nashville, Tenn., 37202. . . . After a search for a site that 
would provide both offices and a training center, USA Volleyball is expected to 
keep its officials in Colorado Springs and its athletes in San Diego. . . . 
Long Beach is among three finalists as headquarters for the international 
softball federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial projections were that the Atlanta Olympics would provide a surplus of 
$160 million. Now, the estimate is less than $60 million. Costs were higher 
than anticipated. . . . The International Amateur Athletic Federation, which 
oversees track and field, and medical authorities continue to dispute the 
starting time for the men's marathon in Atlanta. The IAAF wants it to begin in 
the late afternoon for the finish to coincide with the start of the closing 
ceremony. Doctors prefer a morning start, saying the heat and humidity in 
Atlanta in the late afternoon will endanger the athletes.

IT'S LAST STOP ON NAVRATILOVA'S FAREWELL TOUR; TENNIS: ONE OF THE SPORT'S 
GREATEST PLAYERS WILL END 22-YEAR CAREER AT VIRGINIA SLIMS CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hers is a tennis career not likely to be glimpsed again, if not for its record 
167 singles titles then surely for its 22 years in duration. In an era of 
teen-aged flameouts and injury-induced retirements, Martina Navratilova remains 
an enduring reminder that sheer will could join with emotion to create a potent 
athletic force. 
</P>
<P>
 But not for much longer. It will be with an abiding sense of closure that 
Navratilova begins her last tournament, the $3.5 million Virginia Slims 
Championships, which begin today at Madison Square Garden. The season-ending 
event and the Garden's blue carpet have been a kind of home to Navratilova, who 
has made it to the finals in 12 of 16 singles competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, 38, has been such a lasting fixture on the women's circuit that 
it has come to this: In the year she has chosen to retire, she witnessed the 
debut of the tour's youngest player, Martina Hingis, who was optimistically 
named after the nine-time Wimbledon champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, who began her career in 1973, is retiring because she says she's 
getting old and eager to start the second half of her life, which, she expects, 
will have much to do with adventure and activism. Tennis now seems to be too 
limited a world. Navratilova's competitive drive -- always the spark to her 
tenacity -- is flagging. Always ranked in the top five since 1975, Navratilova 
is now No. 6 and no longer expected to walk over her first-round opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 She'll face Gabriela Sabatini Tuesday night. No matter the outcome, 
Navratilova will be honored after the match with a ceremony during which a 
retirement banner will be raised to the rafters of the Garden, where she has 
won 18 titles -- seven singles and 11 doubles. The banner will be displayed 
during all tennis events in the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, a most sentimental athlete, will no doubt be carried by the 
sentiment of the New York crowd, which rooted against her early in her career 
at the U.S. Open, favoring the cool but inaccessible Chris Evert. The city's 
rowdy fans warmed to Navratilova, whose unequaled power awed them and whose 
heart-on-her-sleeve openness created a rapport. 
</P>
<P>
 Indoors, the fans can be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to playing her, especially because it's her last 
tournament," Sabatini said. "But I'll have to forget about all that when I'm on 
the court and just play my best." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever the fighter, Navratilova yearns to end her career with a victory, but 
even reaching the final, as she did two weeks ago in Oakland, will be 
considered a triumph. The elite field brings together the top 16 players and 
eight doubles teams, and, as happens at the end of the tennis calender, the 
event's subplots are about rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 Steffi Graf, the world's top-ranked player, might not be in New York to defend 
her title. Graf is scheduled to meet Brenda Schultz, but a recurring back 
injury caused Graf to pull out of a tournament last week in Philadelphia and 
two other tour events since the U.S. Open. Graf practiced with Navratilova on 
Friday and said she would wait to decide if she could play. 
</P>
<P>
 That could affect the year-end rankings, especially if No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez 
Vicario continues to play well. Her first-round opponent is Julie Halard.

THE CLOSE, PERSONAL FRIEND TREND; THE RICH AND FAMOUS -- AND ALL THEIR MANY, 
MANY PALS -- ARE WRECKING THE MEANING OF THE WORD FRIENSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bill Clinton has dozens. Barbra Streisand has more than most people could ever 
dream of. And let's not even talk about Steve Spielberg and Jeff Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking Friends. Good Friends. Close Friends. The kind you do lunch with 
and make deals with. The kind you go to gourmet-sushi benefits for, and 
disclose things to the press about. The kind whose shoulder you drape your 
intimate arm around, beaming -- as Clinton did at a recent event for Virginia's 
Democratic senator: "I'm glad to be here with my Good Friend Sen. (Charles) 
Robb." 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who is anybody has them. We can't even count the number Hollywood 
producer Dawn Steel has -- Jodie Foster, Debra Winger and Madonna for starters, 
and of course, Streisand. The President counts among his the governor of 
Wyoming, TV producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, all the folks at Little Rock's 
Rose Law Firm, Steve Breyer (the new Supreme Court justice), Jim McDougal of 
savings and loan fame, and Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rarefied air of the elites, even enemies are Good Friends. At a recent 
dinner in his honor, retiring Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said of 
his rival, Republican Sen. Robert Dole, sure, they didn't always see eye to 
eye, but Bob . . . Bob has always been, in the truest sense of the word, "a 
Good Friend." 
</P>
<P>
 It should be nice, really nice, that the high, the mighty, the moneyed and the 
famous have so many Close Friends. But the truth is, the high and the mighty 
and all their Good Friends are wrecking the meaning of the word friendship for 
the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have is Good-Friend inflation. Nobody is just ordinary anymore," says 
Arthur Asa Berger, a professor of communication and popular-culture expert at 
San Francisco State University. "If everyone is a close friend, then the 
meaning of close friend disappears." 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it hard enough to find and keep real friends these days without letting 
the word erode into a semantic shadow of its former self? Experts say real 
people are lucky to have two or three -- at the outside, maybe, four. "And that 
would truly be a richness in a person's life," says Beverly Hills psychologist 
Toni Bernay, whose research on women in power shows the first thing to suffer 
in public life is true close friendship.  
</P>
<P>
 So, what's their secret? Why do the famous and the powerful have so many Close 
Friends? It's simple. They just say they are friends, and they are. Even if 
they aren't. "In power vortexes like Washington and Hollywood, friend is a 
different species than it is in Champagne-Urbana," says Stuart Fischoff, a 
professor of media psychology at Cal State Los Angeles. "It's the nature of 
mutual exploitation in powerful institutions. In truth, the depth of the 
relationship is like a reflecting pool. You resort to excessive terms if you 
need people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, yes. People needing people. Like Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was out at Disney 
because he and big boss Roy Disney were not Close Friends. But then, Katzenberg 
is in again, because he is Close Friends with media moguls David Geffen and 
Steven Spielberg, and -- voila -- Geffen-Katzenberg-Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, experts say, the famous and powerful are like friendship flypaper. If 
you can't be the powerful, you can at least know them, and through clever use 
of the language, lay a kind of up-close-and-personal claim on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Close Friend is a showy status term now," says New York writer Letty Cottin 
Pogrebin, a founding editor of Ms. magazine who interviewed 200 people for a 
book about friendship. "In a way, it's pitiful that people have to resort to 
such artificial messages. It's sort of like walking down the street talking on 
the telephone. OK, so you don't want to use the phone booth -- but do you have 
to talk in the middle of 5th Avenue and 57th Street?" 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the powerful themselves, who feel compelled to claim so many 
Close Friendships? It could be an appeal to normalcy -- See? I'm just a Regular 
Guy, not power-mad or out of touch. "It humanizes you," says popular-culture 
expert Berger.  
</P>
<P>
 Rampant chumminess, of course, is not without its risks. Just as swiftly as 
the high and mighty are befriended, they can be de-friended when fortunes fall. 
"It's hard for those in power," says Bernay. "They're constantly doing this 
internal dance: 'Are they really my friend? Do they like me because of me, or 
because of what I can do for them?' And when the phone stops ringing, there can 
be a serious crash. We see a lot of that in this town." 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, adds Fischoff, the people with all those friends in Washington and 
Hollywood are "probably more alone than (people) anywhere else on the planet." 
</P>
<P>
 Swell. So maybe they don't really have all those Close Friends. In the end, 
it's just another example of the American love affair with linguistic excess, 
the same thing that turns stars into superstars and then into mega-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 But why should their Close-Friend gain, however transparent, be our loss? I 
mean, you can't even call someone vaguely elevated your "close friend" anymore 
-- even if that someone really is -- without people saying, "Oh, sure." So what 
do we do -- come up with another word? 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the problem is that the word friend is hard to define in our 
society," says Bernay. "People get nervous about it. Given the rapidity of the 
coming century -- because we're all running so fast -- maybe we have to look at 
the exclusivity of the term friend , and struggle a bit with its ambiguity, 
maybe step back from the '50s notion that everything is black and white. As we 
move faster and faster, we're redefining what friendship means." 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe we could wait 100 years for the word to come back around to normal 
use. If you have a good friend to wait with, that wouldn't be so bad.

JACK SMITH: TALK ABOUT YOUR BAD BREAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As fate would have it, I am obliged to search for the answer to the ultimate 
question -- why are we here? -- by the hunt and peck system. 
</P>
<P>
 I have broken my left wrist. It is in a cast. While the fingers are free, they 
are too swollen and constrained by the cast to serve the touch typing system. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been a touch typist since I was 13 years old, and it seems a cruel 
irony of fate that I should be reduced to one finger just as I was about to 
solve the great cosmic riddle. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it would be prudent of me to shelve the subject until my wrist is 
healed, but, like Sherlock Holmes, I feel that the game is afoot and I must 
pursue my quarry while the trail is hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the search may already be over. John Degatina, a faithful 
correspondent of mine, writes that I solved the puzzle some years ago when I 
wrote, "The answer is to keep on living and see what happens next." 
</P>
<P>
 That indeed seems to me as good an answer as any, and I will continue to live 
by it. Meanwhile, however, I feel obliged to quote some of the thoughts of 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Locasso of Huntington Beach writes: "My thoughts crystallized just this 
past week after watching of all things an episode of my favorite show -- 'Star 
Trek: The Next Generation.' Data was talking with someone and the topic was his 
favorite, on being a human. And the comment came out that humans did indeed 
have a purpose in life, and that purpose is to care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, as an old professor used to say, our purpose is to care. To care is 
the only thing I can think of that separates us from any other assemblage of 
molecules, atoms and cells that happens to be in some unified whole. It is 
truly the only behavior that we have that is unique to us as a species. And the 
logic (to me) holds water: that our purpose is somehow bundled up in our 
uniqueness." 
</P>
<P>
 But is it true that as a species we care, and that in caring we are unique? A 
glance at the front page any day will shatter that belief. Ethnic factions 
murder each other. Mothers murder their children. Husbands murder their wives. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, don't polar bears and foxes care about their young? 
</P>
<P>
 June Kawasaki of Monterey Park writes: "You keep wondering why, if God is 
infallible, did we turn out so bad? The gravity of current social trends is 
serious and does call for reckoning. I feel the 'why' is we are being tested 
whether we live up to the image intended by providence -- as a journalist, 
doctor, scientist, cleric, husband, wife, parent or otherwise. Man is given a 
finite span of life, but humanity is infinite, and each is tested for his or 
her part. . . . The why is up to you." 
</P>
<P>
 If humanity is indeed infinite, we'd better get cracking in our search for new 
planets to plunder or in 15 billion years or so we're all going to be fried. 
</P>
<P>
 If we don't die of overpopulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a recent column," writes Eunice Schmidt, "you wrote of the calamitous 
results threatened by the population explosion. I couldn't agree more! I have 
never forgotten what our sociology professor said in 1924 -- yes, 70 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "'The greatest enemy of the Dove of Peace is not the Eagle of Conquest or the 
Vulture of Greed, but the Stork." 
</P>
<P>
 Several readers have responded to my suggestion that we would have no 
population problem if God had made procreation a result of washing the dishes 
instead of sexual union. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a wonderful idea," writes M. Roy Seidler. "Instead of the woman having 
the proverbial headache, the man would suffer from dishwashing trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine the setting in which the wife proposes to her mate: 'How about a 
little dishwashing, honey?' 
</P>
<P>
 "He: 'Dishwashing again? Didn't I do the dishes with you last week or was it 
two weeks ago?' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'C'mon. You haven't done dishes in ages.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'So what. You know I'm not into doing dishes. It hurts my hands. It's 
woman's work.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'There you go with your male chauvinist remarks,' ad infinitum, ad absurdum. 
</P>
<P>
 "And so the battle of the dishes rages onward, and the result is unwashed 
dishes and fewer babies worldwide. Man would no longer saturate our small 
planet with his teeming hordes. We could look forward to the future with hope 
for all mankind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack, if you and I can figure out how to accomplish this task we could get 
the Nobel Prize." 
</P>
<P>
 I really had no such glorious ambitions, but I'm willing to do my part. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time my wife suggests we do the dishes together I'm going to say, 
"Not tonight, honey. I have a broken wrist."  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, I hope to stay alive and see what happens next.

 Reader Dan Hartmann of Fullerton told his 3-year-old daughter, Kelly, that he 
would be taking her with him to vote. They got to the polls and he showed her 
the routine: Sign sheet, get ballot, mark ballot in booth. She seemed just a 
little too excited for the experience, so when he loaded her back into her car 
seat, he asked if she enjoyed voting.

 Kelly smiled. "Yes, Daddy. Now show me the boat."

COMMITMENTS: FOR A GOOD TIME, SKIP THE PIZZA AND AVOID RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL TAVRIS and LEONORE TIEFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 S hortly after the publication of "Sex in America," the University of Chicago 
sex study that cast new light on modern sexuality, the authors obtained an 
exclusive interview with Dr. Frieda Tingle, who, they claim, is the world's 
leading expert on sex. The following conversation is an excerpt from that 
interview.  
</P>
<P>
 Question: Dr. Tingle, what do you think of "Sex in America"? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think it would be a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think Americans are too concerned about orgasms? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Whose? Their own or their neighbors'? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We mean in general. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Orgasm is very important for many Americans because it tells them when the 
sexual encounter is over. Most of these people enjoy competitive sports, where 
some official is forever blowing a whistle or waving a little flag to let them 
know the event has ended. Without orgasm, they would be fumbling around, never 
knowing when it was time to suggest a game of Scrabble or a corned-beef 
sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Dr. Tingle, if you are the world's most renowned sex expert, how come no 
one has heard of you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's my own fault. A talk-show host asked me a perfectly normal question -- 
something like, "What is your preferred sexual position, Dr. Tingle?" or 
"Please give us a description of your partner's pleasure probe" -- when 
something came over me. I said, without thinking, "It's none of your business." 
So now no one in the news media is talking to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Dr. Tingle, since issues of sexual orientation are so much in the news 
these days, will you tell us your own sexual preference? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Certainly. Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Tell us some of the most important findings from your work. 
</P>
<P>
 A: We now know that a man's most important sex organ is his fingers, and a 
woman's most important sex organ is her mouth. With his fingers, he feeds her 
chocolate eclairs. With her mouth, she tells him how wonderful he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With all we keep hearing about the precise latitude and longitude of the 
female orgasm, where, exactly, does it occur? 
</P>
<P>
 A: According to our psychoemotophysioneurohormonological studies, orgasm 
occurs in the head, heart, toes, nose, genitals, shoulders, stomach and 
Louise's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Louise's apartment? 
</P>
<P>
 A: She's my next-door neighbor. Believe me, a lot of orgasms go on there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kinds of things affect a person's ability to have an orgasm? 
</P>
<P>
 A: One important factor is diet. Many times I have been told that it is 
impossible to have an orgasm after eating an entire pizza. I assume this has 
something to do with the Italian religious taboo against sexual abandon. 
Another factor is the weather. Many patients have told me that if the window is 
open and they are being rained on, it is particularly difficult to have the 
orgasmic experience. Obviously, since rain signifies the waters of the womb, 
thoughts of the birth experience are interfering with their sexual 
concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Anything else? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There is no correlation between orgasm and age, love, lust, body shape, 
mental shape, income, education, location or occupation. So far, the rain and 
the pizza are the only things I have found that play a consistent role. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it rude to ask whether your partner has had an orgasm, or is it rude not 
to ask? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm always glad to answer a question on etiquette, because it shows that my 
interviewer has been well brought up. In my new book, "Doing It With Decorum," 
I devote a whole chapter to orgasmic obligations. My opinion is that asking, 
"Darling, did you have the ultimate orgasmic experience?" is too little, too 
late. The correct question to ask is, "Would you like to have the ultimate 
orgasmic experience?" before beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What, then, is a proper standard of sexual etiquette in this modern age? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Too many people keep trying to apply the golden rule, which works 
wonderfully everywhere else but in bed. Do not treat your partner as you would 
have your partner do unto you. This makes partners confused and irritable. She 
wants her back rubbed and he wants his ears nuzzled, so she rubs his back and 
he nuzzles her ears. The moral is to do unto your partners as they would be 
done unto. I'm not anti-biblical, though. It's very nice to turn the other 
cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If the Bible is not the appropriate guide, what is? 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Robert's Rules of Order." You could look them up, and you'll see they suit 
perfectly: "one proposal at a time," "the right of free and full debate," 
"second the motion," "the principle of equality" and "courtesy." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do men and women have different orgasms, Doctor? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, when you ask men and women to write down what orgasm feels like, you 
can't tell which description was written by whom. This means either that orgasm 
is the same for both sexes or that nobody can write clearly anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Dr. Tingle, in your many years as an expert on sexuality, what is the most 
common question you have been asked? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That one. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Well then, what is the most unusual question? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A woman once asked me how she could tell the difference between multiple 
orgasms and hiccups. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did you tell her? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I told her it was six of one, half a dozen of the other.

COMMITMENTS: DESPERATELY SEEKING ANYONE; SINGLE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO NEW AND

 Paul Walton's search for a wife consumes much of his time and $3,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the 38-year-old San Diego millionaire told Oprah's viewers last 
year that he is looking for a mate who wants to "give it up to live it up," he 
has been jetting around the country to meet the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerilyn Walter has taken to the skies to meet Mr. Right, too. Actually lots of 
Mr. Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of hearing her single female friends complain about their lack of dates, 
the 36-year-old Newport Beach businesswoman took action. 
</P>
<P>
 First, she advertised in the Anchorage Daily News, tipped off by television 
reports about great numbers of Alaskan men in search of mates. She invited all 
available men to meet women from Southern California and elsewhere who would 
fly in for a dinner-dance and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got 70 calls in three days," says Walter. Meanwhile, word was spreading 
here, too, and in September, Walter and 127 other women flew to Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 20 couples by the end of the trip," says Walter, who has formed 
Females for New Frontiers, a Costa Mesa-based group whose members go to great 
lengths -- and rack up frequent-flier miles -- to find relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Singles on more modest budgets often invest just as much interest and time in 
the hunt. While some make a habit of checking every ring finger they encounter, 
others develop more ingenious strategies. A Los Angeles woman plans to find 
office buildings where many men work -- and then hang out. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Fernando Valley single slipped on a bogus wedding ring, convinced that 
men would feel more comfortable talking with her if they thought she was 
married. (If something clicked, she figured, she could explain later.) 
</P>
<P>
 While singles engaged in such activities call themselves dedicated , 
determined or dogged in their pursuit of a partner, other folks (especially 
married ones) label them with another "D" word: desperate . 
</P>
<P>
 Like bad breath and body odor, desperation usually belongs to someone else. 
While some singles know other desperate singles and married folks know lots of 
desperate singles, desperate singles rarely describe themselves that way. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, desperate is defined in "The American Heritage Dictionary" as 
"nearly hopeless, critical, grave." The listing follows despair.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has their own definition of desperate ," notes Walton, the mega-buck 
bachelor. When he appeared on another television talk show recently, two female 
guests described how they staged a car accident just to meet firemen. That 
meets Walton's definition of desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto, personal ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, desperate is placing an ad in the paper because I'm really lonely. Or, 
I write Oprah, 'Please help me.' But I didn't call Oprah. They called me. I'm 
not desperate , I'm opportunistic ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not that anyone -- regardless of marital status -- is blaming singles for 
feeling desperate, by the way. 
</P>
<P>
 First there's the car culture, which makes it difficult to meet people out and 
about. (Although one woman tried to solve that problem by writing her 
cell-phone number on a large pad of paper and holding it up to her window so 
the handsome driver in the next lane could see. He was married, but probably 
was admiring her chutzpah as he waved his left hand.) 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are changing expectations that lead naturally to desperation. This 
is the "blame-it-on-society" excuse, but in this case it's valid, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 In generations past, no one expected the sun, moon and stars in a 
relationship, says Kathleen Mojas, a Beverly Hills psychologist. Now, she says, 
people expect more, and some people expect too much -- way too much from their 
partner-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people want to make someone else responsible for their happiness," she 
says. "There's a desperation that they won't find the right one. Some people 
are continually looking -- and mistakenly thinking that the right person is the 
one who holds the key to their fulfillment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Excuses out of the way, there are ways not to look desperate, even if you are, 
say mental-health experts who specialize in singles' issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Singles appear desperate when they're full of self-doubt, says Sharyn Wolf, a 
New York psychotherapist. Eliminate the self-doubt, and poof! go those 
desperate vibes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy for some singles to cluck, cluck over stories of extreme efforts to 
find mates, reassuring themselves they're not that desperate. But Wolf says 
they might take a page from that book. 
</P>
<P>
 As she sees it, many self-doubting singles -- even those seemingly obsessed 
with finding a partner -- often don't go far enough in their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think if we say, 'Hi,' something should happen," says Wolf, who wrote 
"Guerrilla Dating Tactics" (Plume, 1994) and teaches seminars by the same 
title. "But frequently it takes more than a hello." 
</P>
<P>
 It takes creativity, she contends. Even boldness, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose a guy is approaching a woman to ask her to dance. There's the 
traditional way to ask -- and then there's Wolf's way: "Would you like to dance 
-- if only to prove to my friends that I have excellent taste?" 
</P>
<P>
 Or, suppose you're at that most ancient of hunting grounds, the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a risky one," warns Wolf. "Ask, 'Can I buy you a drink or would you 
rather just have the money?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Says Wolf: "Nothing breaks the ice like humor. If you can get them to laugh, 
you know a lot about them. If you can't get them to laugh, you also know a lot 
about them." 
</P>
<P>
 And of course it's difficult to laugh and look desperate simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 In her counseling sessions and her seminars, Wolf has collected a plethora of 
other sure-fire ways to look less desperate. In each case, the emphasis is on 
creativity -- and the other person: 
</P>
<P>
 * One woman donating blood noticed a fellow donor who was a bit green around 
the gills. "She offered him a plate of cookies and said, "I guess natural 
childbirth is out of the question?" (The couple dated -- and married.) 
</P>
<P>
 * A news photographer covering a fire was surprised when a neighborhood woman 
brought him a glass of lemonade -- and even more pleased when he discovered she 
had taped her name and telephone number on it. (Status of couple unknown.) 
</P>
<P>
 While the title "Guerrilla Dating Tactics" has a martial tone, Wolf emphasizes 
that the enemy isn't the potential partner. "The enemy is actually self-doubt. 
And extreme self-doubt often has people behaving in ways that seem desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Think guts, not desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You make a bold first move and then you give 100% of the power to the other 
person," Wolf advises. "You make it clear there's interest on your part and 
then let them take it from there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever technique is used, creativity is vital to camouflage desperation, 
agrees Mojas, the Beverly Hills psychologist. She knows firsthand that some 
singles can get so desperate that they rely on a standard, one-size-fits-all 
opening line. 
</P>
<P>
 Big mistake, no matter how smooth it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way into her gym, Mojas noticed a man a few cars away looking at her 
and waving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he came over and said what a beautiful smile I had." He asked for her 
phone number. Hesitant, she said her business listing was in the yellow pages 
-- but never heard from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "About six weeks later, standing in the line at the movies, I noticed a guy 
looking at me," Mojas says. He came over and told her what a beautiful smile 
she had. Mojas didn't recognize him at first because he was wearing a baseball 
cap. But then came the line -- and deja vu. 
</P>
<P>
 Reason enough, Mojas figured, to let him have it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait a minute," she said. "You've done this before. You didn't call the first 
time. You're probably here with a date. (He was.) I think your picture is in 
the lobby -- you're the popcorn pickup artist!" 
</P>
<P>
 The movie episode brought home a point to Mojas, who now shares it with 
clients she counsels about relationships. (No, it's not, "Don't pick up a date 
on a date.") 
</P>
<P>
 "The more gimmicky you are, the more insecure (you'll be seen as being)," 
Mojas says. "These gimmicky one-liners are much more likely to be turned down," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless, of course, the person who hears them is equally desperate." ARE YOU 
DESPERATE FOR A DATE? Singles who put extraordinary time and effort into 
finding dates and mates are often labeled desperate -- although they much 
prefer describing themselves as opportunistic, dedicated or focused. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some clues that you may be working too hard, offered by Sharyn Wolf, 
the psychotherapist-author of "Guerrilla Dating Tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 You know you're desperate when: 
</P>
<P>
 Your routinely break plans with friends or family if a date calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The first place you look when you meet a new person is the ring finger -- and 
your level of interest in that person depends on his or her availability. 
</P>
<P>
 You find yourself asking new dates such questions as "Been out of prison 
long?" 
</P>
<P>
 You're trying to decide what to wear for a first date and you settle on a 
wedding gown. 
</P>
<P>
 You feel a constant level of anxiety about your single status. 
</P>
<P>
 You fall apart when someone breaks a date. 
</P>
<P>
 Your date is five minutes late and your are sure you've been stood up.

PROP. 187 SPONSORS SWEPT UP IN NATIONAL WHIRLWIND; IMMIGRATION: CALLERS SEEK 
HELP IN CARRYING EFFORT TO OTHER STATES. SOME BELIEVE NEXT STEP IS UP TO 
CONGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Alan Nelson is running out of c lean underwear. Barbara Coe jokes about 
running off to Mexico. And Harold Ezell hardly has time to run his consulting 
business -- helping to obtain legal immigration status for well-to-do foreign 
investors willing to create new jobs in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's landslide victory of Proposition 187 has proved a dizzying 
experience for many of the key sponsors of the get-tough illegal immigration 
ballot measure. Swept into celebrity, they have been inundated by phone calls 
from reporters around the world seeking reaction and from grass-roots groups 
across the nation hoping to launch similar movements in their own states. 
</P>
<P>
 Flush with their success, the leaders of the so-called "save our state" 
movement are working nearly nonstop to spread the gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been donating my time for 13 months to this campaign, so what's another 
week or two," said Ron Prince, who headed the pro-187 campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got off the phone with the Washington, uh, I don't remember if it was 
the Times or the Post, I'm so confused," echoed proposition co-sponsor Coe, who 
heads the California Coalition for Immigration Reform. "I'm drowning in calls. 
I think I'm going to run away from home. I may run away to Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 As they seek to make use of their newfound clout, the movement's leaders speak 
of recall elections targeting officials involved in the flurry of lawsuits 
filed to block the measure within hours of last Tuesday's election. They talk 
of initiatives similar to Proposition 187 being placed on ballots in Arizona, 
Texas and Florida. And they voice hopes that the initiative's success will 
spark similar efforts in Washington, particularly since Republicans will 
control the next Congress and incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich is eyeing 
new measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Among their ideas are legislative action to bolster enforcement along the 
U.S.-Mexico border, to make it harder for employers to hire unauthorized 
workers, and to terminate the few remaining federal benefits that illegal 
immigrants now qualify for, such as school lunches and food for pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no need for another Proposition 187 in any other state if Congress 
does its job: a law that says you will ask and determine the alienage of people 
before you give them any government handouts," said Ezell, former western 
regional director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Some allies even look to a renewed effort to reduce legal immigration, now at 
near-record levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 187 is the clearest ringing bell to wake up our national 
leadership on this question that we've had in 100 years," said Dan Stein, 
executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a 
Washington-based group known as FAIR that seeks restrictions on new arrivals 
and helped bankroll the pro-187 advertising effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all observers agree that Proposition 187 will travel well, cautioning that 
the measure may be a California anomaly. Unlike California, gubernatorial 
elections in Florida, New York and Texas hardly dealt with the issue of 
immigration, and New York's mayor has publicly embraced immigrants, legal or 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope the ugliness of the debate on Proposition 187 in California is not 
the precursor to other ugly debates in other states," said Cecilia Munoz, 
senior immigration policy analyst with the National Council of La Raza, a 
Washington-based Latino advocacy group. "We're going to be watchful, but the 
dynamics in California are very different from elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, California has absorbed both a jarring demographic shift and, 
more recently, a particularly stubborn recession. There was relatively little 
talk about illegal immigrants posing a financial burden back in 1986, when 
there were many more undocumented people but California's then-robust economy 
was generating widespread prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 And nowhere else on the national scene has a leader of the stature of Gov. 
Pete Wilson -- who helped catapult immigration and Proposition 187 to the 
forefront of the state agenda -- been so anxious to take up the divisive and 
racially charged issue. Much of the business community and many Republicans 
remain pro-immigration, as the recent anti-187 blasts by former Cabinet 
secretaries Jack Kemp and William J. Bennett indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Republicans may rue the day if they decide to make immigration a huge, 
ongoing national issue," said Rick Swartz, a Washington lawyer who advises 
pro-immigration groups. "They're inviting a huge fight within the Republican 
Party." 
</P>
<P>
 Many questions also remain about the future role of the INS, which, under 
Proposition 187, would be deluged with lists of "suspected" illegal immigrants 
reported by police, health care workers and educators. The INS already has 
problems just keeping up with the load of deportable criminal immigrants in 
prisons and jails. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of their celebrations, the talk among the Proposition 187 crowd 
is buoyant, upbeat and goal-oriented. And these days, they are being talked to 
on network news broadcasts, "Larry King Live" and "This Week With David 
Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 "Like it or not, California is a national trendsetter," said Ezell, a Newport 
Beach resident. 
</P>
<P>
 In its grass-roots, populist appeal and potential impact, Proposition 187 is 
most often compared to Proposition 13, the tax-cutting initiative spearheaded 
by the late Howard Jarvis. 
</P>
<P>
 And if anyone in the Proposition 187 movement brings to mind the memory of 
Jarvis, it would be Ezell, a onetime hot dog company executive who relishes the 
spotlight and is a comfortable, oft-humorous public speaker. Ezell, however, 
comes with his share of baggage -- a controversial tenure at the INS during the 
1980s (he once made headlines for attending a Hawaiian fete thrown by former 
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, then under federal investigation) and a 
caustic streak that runs counter to Jarvis' folksy, grandfatherly image. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Ezell's election night comments about the campaign rallies held by foes 
of the initiative: 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest mistake the opposition made was waving those green and white 
(Mexican) flags with the snake on it. They should have been waving the American 
flag." 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell said he's having trouble these days finding time to make a living, or 
spend time with his wife, Lee, and their grown daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first 48 hours after the election were a killer, man," Ezell said. "But I 
think it will start leveling out soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, a Tustin accountant who handled the day-to-day campaign, seems less 
camera ready. Indeed, he grows testy whenever asked personal questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a personal life," Prince declared Friday as he juggled calls 
from reporters flooding into the campaign's Orange County headquarters, which 
long boasted a secret location because of his fear of death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of a campaign that featured little centralized organization, it 
may come as little surprise that its leaders are now, on their own, pursuing a 
variety of anti-illegal immigrant agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, for one, is suggesting the recall of public officials who have voted 
to take part in anti-187 lawsuits, even though Prince and other sponsors of the 
measure have long acknowledged that it would not take effect until a flurry of 
lawsuits was ruled upon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The will of the people should be obeyed and it is too often thwarted by 
special interest groups," Prince said. "It doesn't make sense for elected 
officials to sue the people. They should be listening to the people." 
</P>
<P>
 The tall, 61-year-old Nelson, who has been burdened by heart trouble, could be 
viewed as the elder statesman of the movement. The national director of the INS 
during the Reagan Administration, Nelson said he plans to fight for state 
legislation to ensure that jobs vacated by illegal immigrants rounded up by the 
INS are filled by U.S. citizens or lawful immigrants, "particularly those on 
welfare or benefit programs." 
</P>
<P>
 "The jobs could run the gamut -- from dishwasher jobs to landscaping to 
construction -- illegals are involved in all of these," said Nelson, who while 
a Sacramento lobbyist for FAIR was long unable to push through similar bills. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the next week, Nelson, fresh from a national appearance on the Larry 
King show, plans a short victory vacation in the desert with his wife and 
friends. "I hope to play a little golf, relax a little," he said. "It's been 
quite intense lately. I haven't had time to get my car serviced for weeks. And 
I've gotten down pretty low in the underwear drawer, I can tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda political consultant Robert Kiley, who served on the "save our 
state" committee, is seeking to market his skills to anti-illegal immigrant 
activists in other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Coe said she has received calls from grass-roots activists in 18 states since 
Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We anticipated the passage of Proposition 187 would have a ripple effect 
across the nation. Right now, we feel like we are in the midst of a tidal wave, 
for goodness sake. We never in a million years anticipated this type of 
response, and we're obviously thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Coe, activists from states with high numbers of illegal 
immigrants are planning to convene in the near future to discuss a 
state-by-state strategy. But at this point, the "save our state" juggernaut 
remains more a shoestring vessel of public anger than a highly burnished 
political operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, for example, placed a caller from Los Angeles on hold the other day to 
take an incoming call from a reporter in Florida. The reason, he said, was to 
save money for the financially strapped campaign committee by not having to 
return a long-distance call. 
</P>
<P>
 Coe continues to operate her immigration reform effort from her Orange County 
living room, which long ago became overgrown with campaign literature. "I have 
only one request of visitors," Coe said. "If you walk into my place and you 
break your leg, don't sue."

AMID TENSIONS, L.A. AIDS GROUP EVOKES LOVE, ANGER; HEALTH: AIDS PROJECT L.A. 
DEALS WITH GRIEF AND HIGH EXPECTATIONS. IMPROVEMENT NEEDED, OFFICIALS CONCEDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 To stroll past the handsome first-floor exhibit in AIDS Project Los Angeles' 
rambling new building is to get a sense of what people love and loathe about 
the place. 
</P>
<P>
 There, in the photo blowups and big-print text, is the remarkable story of an 
organization that in a little more than a decade has evolved from a volunteer 
hot line run out of a borrowed closet into an institution rich enough -- and 
some say, misguided enough -- to spend $50,000 on a display of its own short 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Second only to New York's Gay Men's Health Crisis in size and budget, APLA 
represents the face of AIDS charities to much of the Southern California 
public. Every year thousands trudge through the shabby streets of Hollywood for 
the organization's AIDS walk. Thousands more crowd into Universal Amphitheatre 
for the annual Commitment to Life benefit, an evening so thick with flashy 
stage shows and Hollywood glitterati that it rivals the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the local AIDS and gay communities, perceptions of APLA are far more 
complex and frayed. There are those who call it their salvation and those who 
vow to never give it another red cent. The disaffected talk of an agency grown 
aloof and unwieldy -- too concerned with glitz and fund raising and not enough 
with clients and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Woven into those notions are all the frictions and frustrations that riddle 
what is ambivalently referred to as "the AIDS industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with dedication and caring, there is turf protection, bickering and 
jealousy. There is smoldering fury over the widening circle of disease and 
death that transforms the young and able-bodied into gaunt, diapered figures 
curled into fetal positions. There is tension between gay and straight, between 
the haves and have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
 In this landscape, APLA is an inviting target, burdened with perhaps 
unrealistic expectations and irresolvable grief. Yet even while APLA leaders 
complain that the agency is often unjustly criticized, they concede the need 
for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a new executive director. Programs are being reworked. Efforts are 
being made to mend relations with other AIDS agencies and adjust to the 
tumultuous growth that has left APLA with more than 4,000 clients, a 
$20-million budget and a headquarters replete with security guards and parking 
attendants.

<P>
 "We're making headway," says Dana Miller, APLA's new board chairman. "It's not 
as fast as people would like, but I think the criticism of yesterday is not as 
valid as it was." 
</P>

 Paul Gronberg sits with a cup of coffee under the awning covering the back 
entrance of APLA's Vine Street building in Hollywood. It is a Tuesday night and 
the parking lot is full. Volunteers are training, support groups are meeting, 
benefits counselors are explaining the mysteries of government forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Gronberg rattles off the programs he uses, sounding like a mini-catalogue of 
APLA services. There are about 20 of them, most tending to the non-medical 
needs of people with AIDS and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The agency runs 
everything from Southern California's major AIDS hot line to a lobbying program 
and AIDS prevention workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 This evening Gronberg is attending his support group for people with HIV. 
Other days he gets groceries from the food bank and calls the agency's client 
line for advice on untangling the cobweb of government and private programs he 
needs to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses. Then, remembering something else, he blurts out, "My teeth! My 
teeth!" 
</P>
<P>
 He opens his mouth into a gaping yawn and points. "See," he commands. 
</P>
<P>
 "They fixed my teeth. They were very good," he says of the dentists. 
</P>
<P>
 It took eight visits to APLA's dental clinic to make up for 15 years of 
neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a drug addict, it's not high on the list," explains Gronberg, who came 
to Los Angeles a year ago after fleeing San Francisco. So many AIDS deaths 
there, he says, it seemed like Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear people bitch a lot (about APLA) and I heard them bitch a lot in San 
Francisco," Gronberg says. "I guess they just need to go to Carson City, Nev., 
and get their AIDS services there." 
</P>
<P>
 Gronberg is happy with APLA. He has been given food, dental fillings and 
counseling, all for free. How, he wonders, can one complain about that? 
</P>
<P>
 There are, in fact, many clients who are happy with APLA. 
</P>
<P>
 A 26-year-old hairstylist recently diagnosed with HIV says he has stopped by 
the building simply to say "Hi," to be in a place where he does not feel so 
suffocated by the fear you can see in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 He has just been to a workshop on how to fill out forms for Social Security 
benefits, something he had not planned on doing for another 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many things I'm not ready to do and have to," he says quietly. 
"You know they're giving you support, a chance to keep fighting, for survival." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are also plenty of people whose involvement with APLA has left them 
chewing a cud of bitterness and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have a problem and you go to a case manager you know she's going 
to tell you she can't help, or call next week," grumbles a commercial artist on 
disability who has been an APLA client for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting to pick up his groceries in the food bank, he sneeringly recites his 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 It took the legal department four months to hook him up with a "real lawyer." 
By then, he had lost his lover's estate to the man's family, who successfully 
contested his partner's will. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the three "buddies" he was assigned through the buddy program -- which 
pairs clients with volunteers who call and visit -- worked out. He doesn't like 
the food bank fare, too many canned goods and not enough fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can be treated like dirt," he continues. "It's an agency that could 
really do much better. Maybe too big, getting too big," he muses. 
</P>
<P>
 Cory Roberts went to APLA in 1992 and 1993, after years of AIDS activism. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I became very sick and lost my job and my apartment and my car, they 
weren't there to help. They really weren't," he says wearily. "I felt like a 
nuisance when I called. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go in there and you feel like cattle," he adds. "That was my experience 
and I left." 
</P>
<P>
 In making that choice, Roberts has a good deal of company. A number of APLA 
clients and unhappy employees have gone to smaller -- and from their 
perspective -- friendlier AIDS organizations in the region. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Loyce speaks rapidly and forcefully. He is all business -- no time for 
chitchat. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran social services administrator from San Francisco, Loyce, 46, assumed 
the executive director's job in January. He carries the high hopes of the board 
of directors that he can help redefine APLA's role, repair its fractious 
relations with other AIDS organizations and, along the way, fix its festering 
management problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think change is necessary and has occurred and it will continue to occur," 
Loyce says. "I am not going to accept the same ol' warmed-over matzo ball 
soup," he adds, repeating the message he says he delivered to his managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a new recipe won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 So many executive directors have come and gone that there is a 7-Eleven joke: 
seven executive directors in APLA's 11 years of existence. (The number is 
actually nine, counting acting directors.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is there a history of friction between staff and administration -- 
"management is often brazen, insulting and unpleasant," is the way one worker 
put it -- but employees worry that reorganization will cost some of them jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyce "came into a bed of alligators, he really did," observed another 
staffer. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Loyce has not lost any limbs to the snapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the board -- which quickly became disenchanted with his predecessor, 
Lenny Bloom -- remains generally supportive of its current executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 To many on the staff, however, Loyce has yet to make much of a mark. "It's 
depressingly more of the same," a third employee said of management's tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no intention of jumping out there and making a big splash," responds 
Loyce, who previously worked as associate director of the San Francisco 
Department of Public Health AIDS office. Referring to both the perception and 
the reality of APLA, he says, "I'm looking at a three-year journey just to get 
it changed in some real way." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever he does, there will be detractors. APLA is constantly being pulled in 
contradictory directions. 
</P>
<P>
 It is condemned for trying to do too much and for not doing enough. For years 
it was criticized as being the province of middle-class gay white men. Now that 
it no longer is, gay men complain that it is losing touch with its founding 
base. AIDS activists deride the star-studded fund-raisers as inappropriate to a 
cause steeped in death, and then covet the money they reap. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether profound or not, change is in the wind, spurred in part by a 1993 
consultants' report that gave the agency mixed grades. Some programs, such as 
benefits counseling, the food bank and dental clinic, were praised. Others were 
faulted for not being responsive enough to clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Against that background, board members say they are taking seriously a mantra 
that APLA leaders have chanted for years but done little about: That the agency 
should not try to be all things to all people. "Let's put that Pollyanna dream 
away forever," says film producer Steve Tisch, who during his two years as 
board chairman lured such Hollywood powerbrokers as studio chief Jeffrey 
Katzenberg and QVC Chairman Barry Diller onto the board, greatly strengthening 
its fund-raising clout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's really acknowledge . . . what we do well and what we don't do well," 
continues Tisch, who passed the chairmanship to Miller last month but remains 
on the board. "We have been, I think, much more open today to let other (AIDS 
organizations) do things that we don't do effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 Some revamping has already occurred. The client loads of case managers are 
being trimmed to more workable levels -- though that has prompted complaints 
from clients who are being dropped. Alterations to the food bank operation are 
more popular. Grocery pickup was streamlined and a San Fernando Valley food 
bank site was expanded. Other programs are still being evaluated to determine 
how they might be revised. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the agency, Loyce is making overtures to other AIDS groups, attempting 
to chip away at the resentment and rivalry that have marked their dealings with 
APLA. For years, smaller organizations have accused APLA of being an arrogant 
bully that gobbles up the public's donations, refuses to share its riches and 
spends too much money on fund raising and administration. 
</P>
<P>
 APLA's Hollywood connections have given it visibility and fund-raising powers 
that other agencies can only fantasize about. The annual Commitment to Life 
gala, started seven years ago with the help of Elizabeth Taylor, raised more 
than $4 million in a single evening last January -- more than the entire annual 
budget of some AIDS groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many AIDS agencies around Los Angeles that are so strapped for 
cash they can't even buy an extra computer," says Keith Brier, a former board 
member of Being Alive, a comparatively tiny organization that runs support 
groups and a speakers' bureau. "When I went into APLA I saw rows of computers 
that weren't being used. . . . The mentality was, this is ours and we're going 
to keep it," complained Brier, who worked briefly at APLA last year. 
</P>
<P>
 APLA has begun doling out more money to other organizations, nearly $600,000 
in this year's budget. But it clearly does not intend to become a bank for 
other Southern California AIDS agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not financiers," Miller emphasizes. "That's not our job." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead the buzzword is collaboration: working with other groups to avoid 
program duplication and help them develop services in their own geographic 
areas, whether by giving them seed money, staff help or assistance in applying 
for grants. There is also talk of establishing an AIDS coalition, under which 
the roles of different agencies would be formally defined. That way, the theory 
goes, the collective could ensure that people with AIDS get what they need. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the history of competitiveness and the size of some egos in the AIDS 
service world, it remains to be seen if true collaboration is possible. But 
there are signs of a thaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly program directors at APLA who were being very reticent about working 
with us are calling us," said Lorri Jean, executive director of the Los Angeles 
Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center. "I think Jimmy has made a tremendous 
amount of progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are skeptical. "With all the rhetoric about collaboration . . . I don't 
think any practical strides have been taken," said Michael Weinstein, president 
of AIDS Healthcare Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 As for what APLA does with its money, the agency's most recent federal tax 
forms -- for fiscal years 1991, 1992 and 1993 -- show that 35% to 37% of its 
total expenditures were devoted to fund raising and administration. The 
comparable 1993 figure for Gay Men's Health Crisis was 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Misenhimer, APLA's chief financial officer and one of its first executive 
directors, agrees that fund-raising costs are too high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to shift our focus from being so heavily reliant on these 
expensive events and donor acquisition programs" such as direct mail 
solicitation, he says, citing cheaper ways of raising money: getting it from 
major donors, corporations and foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's desire to move in that direction is said to be a reason for last 
summer's departure of development director Bill Jones. Jones had an extremely 
successful tenure -- the budget more than doubled during his six years at APLA 
-- but a hefty chunk of that income growth stemmed from special events. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a long 11 years since APLA's beginnings. Death has been the one 
constant as the expanding epidemic has foisted often chaotic growth and change 
upon the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle-class white gay male caseload has evolved into a client base that 
is 7% female, 26% Latino and 18% African American. There are diaper-changing 
tables in the restrooms for infected mothers with babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless drug addicts with AIDS park their shopping carts outside the front 
entrance and nap in the lobby under the large pale letters that proclaim the 
building Geffen Center, after David Geffen, the record and film producer who 
donated $1 million toward the purchase and renovation of the one-time 
television studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County death toll from AIDS now exceeds 17,000, a number that 
includes not only APLA clients but staff members and half of the agency's four 
founders. 
</P>
<P>
 Thom Mosley remembers many of them, though he confesses that the more recent 
deaths are all a blur. "I was part of that nucleus of people who are all dead," 
says Mosley, who spent eight years at APLA before leaving in January. He has 
escaped HIV, but sometimes wishes he had gone with the others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so boring now," he says with a slight sigh. He is nostalgic not only for 
the libertine, pre-AIDS era but for the good ol' days of APLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a surrealistic time as I look back at it," he recalls. "We were 
sort of stumbling in the dark. It was a seductively stressful period. You could 
hardly wait to go to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he says, APLA is like the Red Cross, a bulky, entrenched bureaucracy 
fighting an entrenched disease. He left angry, no longer willing to work in 
such a place. 
</P>
<P>
 He has since mellowed a bit. He returned for the first time last summer and 
was surprised at his reaction. When you see people leaving the dental clinic 
and the food bank, he allows, it helps balance out the failures and missteps. 
</P>
<P>
 He will remember APLA, he says, with fondness, remorse and "hopefully not so 
much rage." More AIDS Information

CLINTON, CHINESE PRESIDENT MEET BEFORE SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN and CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin today for the second 
time in a year, with the two leaders showing that they are working closely 
together for peace in Korea but are still deeply divided over economic and 
trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The two presidents talked for about an hour at a convention center in Jakarta, 
where both men have come to attend a summit meeting of leaders of the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Eighteen nations from around the 
Pacific belong to the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials characterized the meeting as "businesslike and friendly." The 
upbeat tone represented an extraordinary change from a year ago, when Clinton 
and Jiang met for the first time at the inaugural APEC summit in Seattle. At 
that time, the two countries were preoccupied with U.S. complaints about 
repression and human rights violations in China. 
</P>
<P>
 At the session, the two presidents seemed to be joining to press for new talks 
soon between North and South Korea. That would represent an important new step 
toward putting into effect the recently signed agreement under which North 
Korea is to stop developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Clinton -- who during his 1992 presidential campaign had accused 
the George Bush Administration of "coddling dictators" in its policy toward 
Beijing -- sat stony-faced as photographers shot the beginning of the meeting 
with Jiang. Afterward, looking equally grim, he said he had been "as frank and 
forthright as possible" about the differences between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the main dispute to emerge at today's meeting was over China's 
current and pressing drive to be admitted to the new World Trade Organization, 
which will set the rules for liberalized trade among the world's leading 
economic powers. The outcome will determine the extent to which U.S. and other 
foreign companies can sell their products in China. 
</P>
<P>
 China wants to preserve some protection for its industries. It seeks to enter 
the world trade system with some special, more lenient conditions than apply to 
the United States, Japan and Western European nations, on grounds that it is 
still a "developing country." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton told Jiang that in order to enter the new trade group, China would 
have to abide by what he called "the basic rules" that apply to "any other 
nation," according to U.S. officials at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials insist that they are still pressing human 
rights concerns with China. But Clinton shifted course on his China policy last 
May, when he abandoned the threat to remove China's most-favored-nation trading 
privileges in the United States. Since then, U.S. officials have avoided 
further public threats against Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials stressed that Clinton raised human rights issues 
during his meeting with Jiang today, but they were not the main subject of 
conversation and were portrayed as merely one of many issues on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Chinese president thanked Clinton for what he called the 
"progress" in the relationship between the two countries over the past year. 
The President also acknowledged that there has been progress, but he carefully 
added that more needs to be done on human rights in China, U.S. participants in 
the meeting said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have been particularly eager to demonstrate that they 
cooperate closely with China in their policy toward North Korea, because China 
is the only country with any leverage over the Pyongyang regime. Since 1991, 
Beijing has also had diplomatic ties with South Korea, and Chinese Premier Li 
Peng paid a recent visit to Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of Defense William J. Perry recently gave China credit for helping 
bring North Korea into the agreement it signed with the United States. In it, 
Pyongyang promised to freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear weapons 
program in exchange for billions of dollars in economic concessions from the 
United States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
 At today's meeting, Jiang said he hoped that North and South Korea would have 
good talks with one another. His remarks suggested that China is now 
cooperating with the Clinton Administration in pushing the two Koreas to open 
new high-level talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Arranging talks between North and South Korea is important, because South 
Korea has complained that the Clinton Administration should not leave Seoul 
behind as the United States begins to upgrade its relations with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 During today's meeting, Jiang also complained to Clinton about U.S. policy 
toward Taiwan. In September, the Administration announced a modest upgrading of 
the U.S. policy on contacts with Taiwan, with which the United States has no 
diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton reaffirmed the 2-decade-old policy that the United States believes 
there is only one China and that Taiwan is not an independent country. While 
the President's language was not new, it was welcome to China, which considers 
Taiwan to be a renegade province and hopes to regain control over it someday. 
</P>
<P>
 Another human rights issue remained in the foreground as Clinton arrived in 
Jakarta, where students from the disputed territory of East Timor kept up a 
vigil inside the U.S. Embassy compound. 
</P>
<P>
 The embassy standoff came amid reports of violent demonstrations 1,200 miles 
away in Dili, the capital of East Timor, where hundreds of protesters swirled 
through the streets, breaking car windows, setting small fires and throwing 
stones at police. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests proved a major embarrassment to the Indonesian government, which 
had hoped that the summit of Asian and Pacific leaders would showcase the 
country's economic achievements. The talks will be held Tuesday in the mountain 
resort of Bogor, about 40 miles south of Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
 East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was unilaterally annexed by Indonesia 
in 1976 in a move that has never been recognized by the United Nations. East 
Timor is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, while Indonesia's population of 180 
million is predominantly Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
 A small independence movement has been fighting to force the Indonesian 
government to withdraw its troops from East Timor, but most of its members are 
now in Indonesian jails. The group recently began peace talks with the 
Indonesian government at the United Nations, but Indonesia gave no indication 
that it is prepared to relinquish control of the territory. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jakarta, 29 East Timorese students remained holed up in a walled parking 
lot at the U.S. Embassy complex. The students scaled a high wrought-iron fence 
Saturday as hundreds of riot police looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 A group spokesman said they were demanding to meet with Clinton or Christopher 
to present their demands for the release of guerrilla leader Jose (Xanana) 
Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a chance to tell Christopher that we have been suffering for 19 years 
and we hope you can solve this problem," said group leader Domingos Salmento 
Alvas. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Embassy said in a statement that the demonstrators had been offered 
water and a chance to meet with U.S. Ambassador Robert Barry. "We have urged 
them to present their concerns in a constructive and timely manner through the 
President's personal representative," the statement said. "They have not 
accepted our offer at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher told reporters Saturday that the United States plans to press 
Indonesian President Suharto about East Timor and other human rights issues 
during a one-day state visit by Clinton on Wednesday, after the summit talks 
are concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton, during a one-day visit to the Philippines, said Sunday, "Human 
rights is too important (an issue), particularly now, to pass by." Clinton told 
a news conference in Manila that he would "absolutely" be raising human rights 
issues in Jakarta even though the question is not part of the formal agenda for 
the summit.

COLUMN ONE; ANALYSIS OF A DOOMED CAMPAIGN; KATHLEEN BROWN CHANGED ISSUES TOO 
OFTEN AND RAN OUT OF MONEY. BUT EVEN IF SHE HAD MADE NO MISTAKES, SHE FACED A 
POLITICAL MASTER HOLDING TWO ACES -- CRIME AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't supposed to be like this, Democrats said to each other in the final 
days of the campaign, as the grim reality of Kathleen Brown's fate became 
apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the crown princess of California politics, the telegenic daughter of 
one governor and sister of another, a bright shining star on whom the Democrats 
had been pinning their future hopes for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when she lost her bid for the governorship to Republican Pete Wilson, she 
lost big, her defeat taking on the dimensions of a political train wreck. She 
lost the state by 15 points, lost even Democratic-leaning Los Angeles County. 
She carried fewer votes than several lower-ranking members of the Democratic 
ticket. She won five counties, half the number Democrats count on even when 
they lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Democrats and Republicans now say, there were signs of the 
impending blowout all along. 
</P>
<P>
 No one moment turned the course, no one event crystallized Wilson's advantage 
over Brown. Rather, she had -- to borrow one of the political world's favorite 
phrases this year -- three strikes against her: message, money and the voting 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Poll after poll showed Wilson controlling the issues Californians deemed 
important. Poll after poll showed that Brown's support came from people who 
just liked her or her family, not from those committed to her because of a 
deeper political issue. She was ideologically estranged from the bulk of 
California, both in her stance on the death penalty and on the initiative to 
which she hitched her final hopes -- the polarizing Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 She was outspent over the course of the campaign by several million dollars, 
and she ran in a year in which having a "D" after one's name on the ballot was 
very nearly a death knell. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeniably, her campaign made strategic errors as well, ones that haunted her 
effort and those of other Democrats on the ticket. She and her campaign made 
critical miscalculations about the issues that would motivate voters in this 
most angry political year. 
</P>
<P>
 "To some degree Kathleen came into this with more of a reputation for being a 
political pro than she deserved," said one prominent Democrat. "She had one run 
once before for a down-ballot office (state treasurer) against an appointee. In 
a state this big and complicated, that is not much experience." 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats and Republicans suggest now that even had Brown run a 
strategically brilliant campaign, her chances would have been iffy, at best. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless Kathleen Brown had sat down at least two years ago and rethought her 
basic philosophical underpinnings, she was going to have a very, very difficult 
race regardless of what she did," said Dan Schnur, Wilson's press spokesman, 
who echoed the views of many Democrats. "Ultimately, this was an election that 
came down to very stark philosophical differences." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown does not agree, and lays the primary blame for her defeat on the 
Republican tide that engulfed the nation Tuesday. With her genetically 
optimistic style, she remains proud of what she did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was broke so many times in this campaign," she said in an interview after 
the election. "We started every Monday with $68 in the bank. It was 
unbelievable what was achieved. Unbelievable that we kept coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rule is a hard-and-fast one in the cyclical and frequently mystifying 
world of electoral politics: Never re-fight the last election. This time 
around, doing so was particularly lethal. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was what it appeared Brown was doing for much of the campaign. Like 
the party's 1992 presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, Brown focused a great 
deal of fire on the economy. Like Clinton, she had in her sights an unpopular 
Republican. Like Clinton, she bound up a "plan" in a shiny cover, rolled it up 
and used it to browbeat the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats could have been forgiven, in those glowing early days after their 
sweeping 1992 victory, for having illusions that the same sort of appeal would 
prevail two years hence. Nothing could have been further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs were simple at first: Pollsters started picking up hints that voters 
once again considered Republicans better suited than Democrats to deal with 
their problems. The public rebelled at Clinton's health care plan, deriding it 
as a big-government solution in a time when people wanted government small. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear raised its head, as it frequently does when times are tough. Crime zoomed 
to the top of the list of issues important to Californians, followed quickly by 
its partner in emotion: illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson laid the groundwork for his campaign more than a year before the 
election, when he started stoking the fires about illegal immigration and 
crime. The power of incumbency came into play: It is impossible to ignore 
illegal immigration as an issue when a governor uses it to declare war on the 
President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Brown campaign remained convinced that the economy would be 
Wilson's albatross. A year ago Wilson had historically low popularity ratings 
and they believed that ultimately voters would look at Wilson's tenure as 
governor and decide he did not merit a second term. They persisted in those 
thoughts even during the spring and summer as the economy began an 
ever-so-slight improvement and Wilson's favorability nudged upward. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was afraid they were right, so he did what all clever politicians do: 
He changed the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the genius, the shrewdness of Wilson's strategy," said John Brennan, 
director of the Los Angeles Times Poll. "He turned it away from himself to 
other things." 
</P>
<P>
 But what allowed him to turn the focus around, of course, were the attitudes 
of voters themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1992 there was a very strong Democratic tail wind, a very unusual 
Democratic tail wind, and the economy dominated the issue agenda," Brennan 
said. "Nothing else was even on the screen; crime was barely mentioned by 
voters. We're light-years away from that election now. Kathleen Brown was 
mistaken to think that 1992 was a pointer toward 1994. . . . One election does 
not forecast the next." 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, a strategist who managed John Garamendi's campaign against Brown 
for the Democratic nomination, lauds Wilson's campaign strategists as the 
finest in the business and uses as Exhibit A their tactical moves this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they basically did was get the dialogue in this campaign onto their 
turf," he said. "Crime and immigration -- on those issues a Republican male is 
going to beat a Democratic female. They find weaknesses. . . . They put a 
finger in the wound and keep expanding the wound. The death penalty was 
obviously one. It furthered concerns about Kathleen Brown's ideology and 
ability to govern." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether a candidate creates an issue, or whether he or she merely follows 
developing public opinion, is difficult to assess. Whether Wilson pulled voters 
his way, or simply caught the issue wave earlier than Brown, he controlled the 
important issues entirely. Throughout the general election campaign, whether 
voters were asked who would better handle crime or immigration or the economy, 
the majority had one answer: 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once crime and immigration were established as Wilson's campaign issues, the 
Brown campaign was faced with a choice: Change the subject themselves and focus 
on other issues, or roll the dice and try to beat Wilson at his own game. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the Brown campaign, there appeared to be dissent over which path to 
take. Brown's first -- of several -- slogans sought to establish her as the 
candidate who would rebuild the economy. Then, in the late spring and early 
summer, Brown stood up and came at Wilson with a full-throated assault on a 
most unlikely issue: crime. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, at minimum, a long shot strategy given Wilson's decades-long public 
record as a friend of crime victims' groups and a campaigner against Democratic 
legislators for toughened sentences -- and Brown's personal opposition to the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Her maneuver turned out to be the political equivalent of Pickett's Charge, in 
which thousands of Confederate soldiers literally walked across a field at 
Gettysburg only to be mowed down by Union troops. Like the Union soldiers, 
Wilson's troops were waiting, and as soon as they got over their astonishment, 
they shot at Brown with both barrels. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Southern soldiers, Brown left herself utterly unprotected. First she 
charged that Wilson's parole policies had let violent criminals out of jail to 
murder and assault frightened Californians. But in the case she cited, one 
involving a convict named Melvin Carter, it turned out that state officials had 
been required to release him under rules implemented by Brown's brother, Gov. 
Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown nonetheless continued arguing the case, even as local prosecutors 
essentially sided with Wilson's version of the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the political realm, where perception frequently outpaces reality, Brown's 
move allowed Wilson several shots: It made her look like she operated without 
regard to facts. It reminded voters anew of the familial connection between 
Brown and her brother, still a figure in some disrepute among California 
voters. It gave Wilson another chance to define Brown as a "no-show" in the war 
against crime. And it gave him another weapon with which to hammer at Brown on 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also sought to pin other crime-related errors on Wilson, such as his 
Administration's inability to account for thousands of registered sex offenders 
and the fact that, even after 12 years of Republican governors, Californians 
feel more unsafe now than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 While Brown's arguments might have had logical merit, she lost the battle of 
imagery. Not for nothing had Wilson been pounding a lectern for years about 
crime. He had become, in California, the personification of the average Joe's 
uphill struggle against fear of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's campaign manager, George Gorton, said the campaign's internal polls 
showed that each time Brown launched a major offensive about crime, Wilson 
benefited. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was impregnable on the crime issue," Gorton said. "Melvin Carter was a 
turning point, when she persisted in something that was a fallacy. It tarnished 
her own image." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when Brown ran out of money and had to pull her advertising the weekend 
before Election Day, a senior Democrat pointed back to the summer spent trying 
to best Wilson on crime as part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was on the air all summer, with no movement," the Democrat said. "She was 
flat-lining. She could have taken (the money that paid for) two weeks of July 
and two weeks of August and socked it away." 
</P>
<P>
 And there was not even any political benefit to show for the millions spent. 
The decision to focus so heavily on crime cost Brown not only money but 
valuable time in which she could have defined herself to California voters. It 
apparently did not make a dent: A Labor Day poll taken by The Times showed that 
only 24% of registered voters believed that Brown was better equipped than 
Wilson to handle crime. By Election Day, the numbers were virtually unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's campaign manager, Clint Reilly, insists that she had no choice but to 
go hard against Wilson on crime and other issues in the summer, regardless of 
the cost. That became apparent, he said, immediately after the primary when 
polls showed Brown behind Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We -- and I think correctly -- assessed that if we went passively through the 
summer we probably would have been behind 20 points, and would have been in an 
irretrievable situation," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur, Wilson's spokesman, suggested that Brown's strategy was driven not by 
a realistic assessment of her own strengths on the crime issue but by her 
campaign manager's most recent electoral efforts. Reilly's latest campaigns had 
featured two Republican men -- Frank Jordan in San Francisco and Richard 
Riordan in Los Angeles -- seeking to become mayors in Democratic cities. 
</P>
<P>
 While both of them were able to project an aura of toughness about an issue of 
striking importance to voters, Brown was not -- for reasons that probably were 
influenced by her death penalty position, her gender and her connection to 
brother Jerry, whose appointment of anti-capital punishment Rose Bird to the 
state Supreme Court is still a fresh memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Reilly) must have thought he could either make Kathleen Brown more effective 
than Pete Wilson on crime or even them out," Schnur said shortly before 
Election Day. "You have to address it, but the most recent poll had 22% saying 
she was the most credible on crime. If she had never uttered a single word, 
that number probably would not be different." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To Brown herself, the money spent in the summer was crucial to her effort. If 
she did not boost herself in the polls by Labor Day, her campaign believed, she 
was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole strategy was to get through Labor Day with a good poll," Brown said 
after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 When the polls came out after Labor Day, however, the news was not good. Brown 
trailed Wilson by nine points among likely voters, the Los Angeles Times Poll 
found, and had failed to create a groundswell of support for her own candidacy. 
That poll and others taken at the same time did grievous damage to her 
fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The poll came out and cost me a million dollars. And then another poll was 
even worse," she said. "The money dried up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign did its best to shield from public view its shaky finances; 
its officials consistently told reporters that they had enough to last. But the 
empty pockets became stunningly obvious the weekend before the election, when 
Brown became the only major party candidate in anyone's memory to virtually go 
off the airwaves. Money spent for advertising in the last weeks, considered the 
most important to campaign professionals, was minimal compared to other 
Democratic candidates' expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 The seeming shut-down unleashed bounding anger among many Democrats toward the 
Brown campaign and its manager Reilly, whom many accuse of mismanaging the 
campaign's finances. From White House officials to partisans for lower-level 
candidates, all were enraged that Brown would go dark at such a crucial time 
for the party's ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 But concerns about the Brown effort abounded, and in fact predated Reilly's 
arrival in the spring. From the beginning, under both of its management teams, 
the Brown effort seemed to have trouble defining its own candidate. So many 
slogans and campaign commercials proliferated, according to some professionals, 
that no one image of Brown ever sank into voters' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 As Schnur, Wilson's spokesman, put it in a memorable memo to political 
reporters, hers was a candidacy of "two years, 39 television commercials, two 
campaign teams, five slogans and $24 million." 
</P>
<P>
 What Wilson had that Brown lacked, many Democrats and Republicans agree, was a 
defining agenda. For Wilson, that was crime, illegal immigration and jobs, a 
triumvirate that he repeated like a mantra from the early days of the campaign 
to the last. Brown's focus, perhaps by necessity as she struggled to catch up, 
shifted regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Mulholland, the Democratic party's campaign adviser, quotes Republican ad 
master Roger Ailes' definition of a winner: Show me a candidate with a cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilson told us in 1993 what his cause would be," said Mulholland, who 
described the Democratic defeat as a "team effort." "And the Democrats never 
had one. We were all over the map. We should be taken out back and shot. This 
was an election we should have won." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown did, of course, find a cause at the end: Her opposition to the 
anti-illegal immigrant Proposition 187. She campaigned in the final weeks with 
a fiery energy, earning praise even from Democrats who had earlier doubted her 
core beliefs. There was only one problem: Voters, by a 3-2 margin, favored the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Reilly lay blame for her showing on the anti-Democratic sentiment of 
voters and, as well, on the campaign's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Wilson) had an enormous amount of money . . . to define Kathleen and we 
didn't have the money to defend her adequately," said Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Even many Democrats, however, do not buy that excuse. They contend that the 
money was there -- not enough to match Wilson, perhaps, but enough to define 
Brown had the campaign settled on different tactics. Brown is believed to have 
spent close to $24 million in pursuit of the governorship; Wilson spent several 
million more. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Democrats, now engaged in a familiar post-election rite of questioning 
their party's future, describe the Brown campaign in the most dire of terms. It 
wasn't even a contest, said one. Criminal malfeasance, said another. Most agree 
that most everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown was never able to enunciate a rationale for her election as 
governor to either insiders or voters," said Democratic strategist Sragow. "She 
just failed to succinctly state her own case. Whether the candidate doesn't 
have vision or the campaign can't articulate it, I don't know. The campaign 
didn't work."

COLLEGES TARGET AGING RICH IN HUGE FUND-RAISING DRIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every college and university in the nation, it seems, is looking for the 
almighty dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, for that matter, the yen, pound or franc. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether public or private, big or small, the nation's institutions of higher 
education are into raising money as never before. And they are doing it both 
here and abroad, sometimes to the chagrin of alumni who must face an increasing 
barrage of solicitations from their alma maters. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons are both obvious -- rising costs at a time of declining government 
help -- and more subtle, involving the aging of America's wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, Pepperdine University launched a slick fund-raising effort with a 
goal that would have been unheard of a decade ago: $300 million in new 
contributions. The University of California at Berkeley is preparing for the 
most ambitious campaign in its long history, aimed at bringing in $1 billion by 
the turn of the century. Last year alone, Stanford raised $221 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount University is about to start a campaign in which the goal 
will be $128 million, a huge amount of money for a school of its size. USC is 
gearing up for a megabuck campaign that will begin next year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the country, Harvard, being Harvard, began a fund-raiser 
this year that puts the rest of them to shame -- a mind-boggling $2-billion 
goal that would be added to the school's already-huge endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are campaigns starting off every single day," said Charles Stephens of 
Indiana University's Center on Philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fund-raiding machines are going to be running at high speed for the next 
20 years or so. The reason: The timing will be right for an aging segment of 
society to be parting with its money. 
</P>
<P>
 Demographers say that a huge amount of cash, in excess of $5 trillion and 
perhaps as much as $10 trillion, will soon begin changing hands from one 
generation to the next in the United States. The nation's colleges and 
universities are angling to get a piece of that very large pie. Their prime 
target is wealthy people without children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The generation that is getting older right now is an extraordinarily wealthy 
one and, in an unprecedented way, that wealth is going to be transferred," said 
Brad Barber, director of institutional advancement for the University of 
California. "Even if we exclude those who have children, it's a staggering 
amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleges and universities feel the need to attract more money because of 
pressure from other demands on the public till. Coupled with that, the 
double-digit returns on investments made by colleges and universities in the 
'80s are now a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the Common Fund, a nonprofit group that provides investment 
services to colleges and universities, said there will be "enormous pressure" 
to raise huge amounts of money in the coming years, largely to support 
endowments and scholarship funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the 1990s could be the most difficult climate for higher education 
in five decades," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving to education already ranks second to religion as the major source of 
philanthropy in the United States. Last year, charitable donors gave more than 
$15 billion to education alone. "People give to education because they see 
themselves empowering others to do as they have done," said Stephens. "I think 
there is as much a missionary attitude giving to education as there is giving 
to the church." 
</P>
<P>
 But educators also say that, in the world of giving, both individual and 
corporate donors are becoming a much more fickle bunch. They say that the days 
of just being handed a check is rapidly becoming a thing of the past, that 
donors are demanding more accountability than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 "The product will have to be much more defensible," said Gene Wilson, former 
president of the Arco Foundation, which administers charitable gifts for the 
corporation. "You may want to build a gym or an art center or endow a chair, 
but the institutions now have to justify it." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the world of higher-education fund raising is a very mixed bag. 
The likes of high-profile private schools such as Stanford and USC have long 
had their fund-raising apparatus in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, schools within the University of California system have had to 
switch gears and make money-raising a top priority as state funds have dried 
up. Of those, the two most successful have been UCLA and Berkeley, the biggest 
names in the system. Only last month, UCLA announced that it had received $95 
million in gifts and grants during the last year. Berkeley raised $110 million 
for the same period. Taken together, the two schools accounted for about half 
of all gifts to the UC system. 
</P>
<P>
 So successful have the two campuses been in raising money that there is 
occasional talk that they should go it alone, becoming privatized universities 
separate from the other schools within the state system. But even advocates 
point out that political realities would make such a move highly improbable. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowest on the fund-raising ladder is the 21-campus Cal State University 
system, which until recently did almost nothing by way of soliciting 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I arrived, we had campuses where they believed it was illegal for us to 
have development offices," said Cal State Chancellor Barry Munitz, who took 
over his duties in 1991. "Now, it's a whole new ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Cal State campuses raised $109 million, a relatively modest 
amount in the world of educational fund raising but nonetheless a Cal State 
record. Presidents of all the Cal State universities have been given the 
mandate to raise 10% of their operating budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Patino, a vice chancellor for development, said the system hopes to 
realize a 30% increase in money raised this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how much of a focus is being given to this by our presidents," Patino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some of the schools have had so little in donations as to be almost 
negligible. Cal State Bakersfield, for instance, was given only $20,072 last 
year. Cal State Dominguez Hills received only $67,490. And the school that 
raised the most, San Jose State, pulled in only $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That, from a system with more than 2 million alumni that account for roughly 
10% of the state's work force. Cal State fund-raisers say that in some cases, 
they began with little by way of even the most basic tools, such as names and 
addresses of graduates. They say the key now is to begin the process that 
should have been done all along -- cultivating the alumni. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to date before you can propose marriage," said James Glass, vice 
president for university advancement at California State Polytechnic 
University, Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Glass should know. Before joining the Cal State system this year, he spent 
much of his career as a professional fund-raiser. He said two major phenomena 
are happening these days in the world of raising money: the decline of the 
corporation as a bulwark for higher education and a major increase in looking 
overseas for support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the current experience in California tells us that corporate giving 
as a mainstay is, over time, not going to be as valued as it has been in the 
past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, fund-raisers are turning more to foreign sources. Glass said the 
reasons are simple enough. There is a core group of graduates scattered 
throughout the world and, until recent years, it has been an almost untapped 
resource. 
</P>
<P>
 At Stanford, the office of development established an international division 3 
1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Suda, the director of Asian operations, said an astonishing 8% of all 
the money raised by the school last year came from the Far East. He also said 
there had been "an explosion of interest" in Asia among all manner of nonprofit 
organizations that see it as an untapped source. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, fund-raisers said there is an increasing demand to present 
potential donors with sophisticated ways in which they can give their money 
away but, at the same time, get something in return. Many schools nowadays are 
adopting a program pioneered in the West by Pomona College more than 40 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Pomona plan, and ones similar to it, donors turn over their assets 
to the school and in return receive an income for life as well as major tax 
deductions. When the donor dies, the money reverts to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 That, said Barber of the UC system, fulfills one of the prime criteria of 
asking for money. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to have to ask for it in a way that makes sense to the 
donors," Barber said. "It has to make sense for a charitable reason and it has 
to make sense as a tax reason."

BIRTH DEFECTS IN GULF VETS' BABIES STIR FEAR, DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten babies have died here already. 
</P>
<P>
 The children of Persian Gulf War veterans, they died of heart defects and 
liver cancer. One was born with no spleen. Three were stillborn. 
</P>
<P>
 Their short, tragic lives -- chronicled neatly by their mothers in family 
photo albums -- are raising new fears that the mysterious Gulf War syndrome, an 
inexplicable, untreatable collection of afflictions that reportedly have 
touched thousands who fought in the desert, is now being passed on to the next 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Here at Ft. Bragg, home to the Army's 82nd Airborne Division, veterans' wives 
learned almost by accident that they were not the only ones mysteriously losing 
children. Some by chance struck up casual conversations with other grieving 
mothers at the beauty shop; others traded stories at the grocery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ft. Bragg experience is being repeated all over the United States. With 
some groups believing that as many as 65% of the children born to Gulf War 
soldiers are suffering in some form or another, veterans and their spouses are 
growing confused and angry -- and are increasingly refusing to have more 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that it took the government 20 years to acknowledge that Vietnam War 
veterans were harmed by exposure to Agent Orange, they worry that their lives 
are being ruined by a Pentagon that has yet to draw any relation between the 
illnesses and possible exposure to chemicals or other toxins. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they could give me some sort of medical reason, I might not feel this way 
-- but I am very angry," said Malulani Patrick of Fayetteville, whose child, 
Logan Jacob, was stillborn a year after the Gulf War ended. "This was my first 
baby, and our son's death really tore us apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department officials say that while they deeply sympathize with the 
ailments and deaths, they have yet to pinpoint a cause. They maintain that 
unless more research shows otherwise, U.S. soldiers in the Gulf were not 
exposed to life-threatening chemicals or other toxic agents, from either the 
U.S. military or the regime of Iraq's Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force Lt. Col. Doug Hart, a Pentagon spokesman on health and personnel 
matters, says some studies suggest that the infant deaths and birth 
abnormalities are in line with expected percentages in the general population. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't tell that to the mothers of Waynesboro, Miss., site of a National 
Guard quartermaster corps. There, 13 of the 15 children born to returning Gulf 
War veterans suffer from serious birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis West said his daughter, Reed, was born prematurely with collapsed lungs 
and a faulty immune system that leaves her almost defenseless against pneumonia 
and bronchitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Aimee Miller said her son, Joshua, came down with strange colds, pneumonia and 
high fevers. A simple mosquito bite caused his face to swell and his eyes to 
close shut. Some nights he would wake up in a raging fit and run through the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Infant mortality rates have suddenly increased among Gulf War veterans in four 
counties in Kentucky and Tennessee, home base of the Army's 101st Airborne 
Division; in three counties in Georgia that support the Army's 197th Infantry 
Division, and at Ft. Hood in Texas. 
</P>

 Here in Fayetteville, Melanie Ayers lost her 5-month-old son, Michael. Except 
for some unusual sweating bouts, he had seemed a healthy child. Then, during a 
restless sleep one night last summer, he stopped breathing. And while Ayers 
frantically drove him to the hospital, he died. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating the way people are just patronizing to us," she said. 
"They pretend they understand our anguish. But we're getting more upset with 
government officials coming out and saying how confusing this all is but doing 
nothing to solve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not out to point my finger at the government. But it's been over a year 
now, and all I want is for them to tell me why my son died." 
</P>
<P>
 That the Pentagon still cannot do, although spokesman Dennis Boxx says the 
government is pursuing the matter "very aggressively on a number of fronts." 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not have any indication at this point that these things are 
transmittable to children or spouses," Boxx said. "But we have not ruled out 
the possibility. We simply cannot. Because if we cannot diagnose it and 
describe what it is, we then cannot tell you that it is not transmittable." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, the Air Force spokesman, said the Pentagon is continuing to gather and 
examine statistics on health matters from Gulf War veterans and is comparing 
them with data from soldiers who did not go to the Gulf, as well as 
accumulating other data on the long list of ailments that have touched the 
soldiers and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that a study by the Mississippi State Department of Health, which 
analyzed the incidents of birth defects in Waynesboro, came up with initial 
findings that indicated a normal rate of birth defects for the group there. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the phenomenon persists. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year after the war ended in early 1991, veterans began complaining of 
strange diseases. Rashes, nausea, headaches, even more severe ailments such as 
blood clots and cancers were revealed. Pentagon, veterans affairs and private 
medical experts remain at a loss to explain the problems, let alone determine 
if they are in any way related to service in the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 In hearings before Congress, the sick veterans charged that they were 
carelessly exposed to dangerous toxins and that the government knew of the 
health risks and was trying to cover them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials deny this. But Congress passed a Gulf veterans aid bill, 
signed this month by President Clinton, that authorizes payments to veterans 
who are chronically ill with undiagnosed disabilities that surfaced during or 
after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, while noting that the illnesses cannot yet be medically 
explained, added that this "should not stop us from providing an expeditious 
and compassionate response to these veterans' needs." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the bill did not extend assistance to the veterans' families, 
something many angry parents hope to push through Congress next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a special Gulf War registry continues to document the individual 
cases of veterans. Of the 697,000 soldiers sent to the region, about 29,000 
have signed on to the VA's registry. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the new indications that the disease is spreading to children that 
alarms many who are racing to find an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in the private sector theorize that U.S. troops may have been harmed 
by any of a wide range of chemical or biological agents; by uranium, sandfly 
fever or oil fires; or by anti-nerve-gas medications. 
</P>
<P>
 When they returned home and began reporting their symptoms, some of their 
wives also began coming down with similar rashes, fatigue and other ailments. 
Strangest of all, many wives complained -- and still complain -- of burning 
urinary tract and vaginal infections after having sex with their husbands. They 
also said their husbands produced "burning semen" that burns the skin when it 
is touched. And while many of the ill veterans and their families now live 
together in military communities such as Fayetteville and Waynesboro, the 
husbands did not necessarily serve together in the Gulf region. Rather, they 
were spread out in different units around the Gulf area, raising the 
possibility that any toxic exposure may not be confined to just one group of 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Further befuddling to researchers is the fact that some of the fathers of ill 
or dying children have similar ailments while others seem perfectly fine. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing is clear: 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months have come slow but mounting indications that the illnesses -- 
particularly those of the children -- might be related to the Gulf War 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ellen Silbergeld, a molecular toxicologist at the University of Maryland, 
told a congressional hearing in August that scientists now know that men 
exposed to toxic chemicals can pass the poison directly to their children 
through semen. What is frightening, she said, is that the chemicals can cause 
genetic mutations to the sperm that helps conceive the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly why this occurs, she added, is the "question we know the least about." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Francis J. Waickman, an Akron, Ohio, environmental pediatrician, compared 
birth-defect statistics of Gulf War babies and other children. He found a 30% 
rate of abnormalities among the children of Gulf veterans -- "probably tenfold 
of what is in the normal population," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as experts delve further into the issue, he said, more questions pop up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can it be passed on? The answer is yes, insofar as we have hard evidence that 
chemicals can absolutely decrease numbers of sperm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can create an infant whose immune system does not function normally, and 
as a consequence this can be a cause for the increased incidence of infections 
in these children. 
</P>
<P>
 "But does this alter genes? And can this occur when you have severe chemical 
exposure?" 
</P>
<P>
 He answered his questions this way: "To my knowledge, this is the first time 
we've ever had such a large group exposed to a possible large degree of 
chemicals, so we better learn from this whole series of events." 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Mekdeci, founder and director of the Assn. of Birth Defect Children in 
Orlando, Fla., is also studying the illnesses and deaths. Her group is 
circulating 10,000 questionnaires to Gulf War families in search of information 
that will be thoroughly dissected in a search for trends and patterns. What she 
hopes to determine is whether the ailments and fatalities are linked to the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 "These families need to know," she said. "They need answers now on whether 
they should have more children." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a recent report by the government's General Accounting Office 
identified three factors -- pesticides, oil fires and decontaminating agents -- 
that were present in the war environment and may have caused "reproductive 
dysfunction" in the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 But how direct and widespread the exposure was remains debatable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The studies performed to date are unfinished," the GAO said, "cannot be 
generalized, or are too weak methodologically to demonstrate convincingly that 
there are or are not abnormally high reproductive dysfunction rates among 
Persian Gulf veterans and their families." 
</P>
<P>
 It is this kind of lingering doubt that continues to confuse the parents of 
the ill and dying. The only thing they know for sure is that their children 
born before the war are fine, but those who came later are not. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Sullivan of Fayetteville, whose son, Matthew Adam, died in his sleep at 10 
months, said he had seemed fine since birth. But after his death last year, 
doctors discovered cancer that ruptured his liver and caused him to hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan has since learned that it is extremely rare for children to contract 
liver cancer, and she said she has been told that "it is not likely but is also 
not unheard of" that there could be a Gulf War connection. 
</P>
<P>
 She opened a photo album and showed pictures of her seemingly healthy son, one 
taken shortly before his death. Not knowing, she said, is the worst pain of 
all, and until she knows, her dream of having more children is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess not until I'm brave enough to know I could handle a death," she said. 
"I guess that's hardhearted, but that's the way it is."

RETROFITTING LAG BLAMED FOR QUAKE FREEWAY TOLL; ROADS: ENGINEERS' PANEL SAYS 
FAST PACE BEGUN IN 1989 WASN'T KEPT UP. MANY PROJECTS YEARS FROM COMPLETION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The greater-than-expected damage to Los Angeles' freeway system in the 
Northridge earthquake can be blamed on the slow pace of a seismic strengthening 
program that is still years away from fixing some of the state's most 
vulnerable bridges, a panel of engineers has found. 
</P>
<P>
 If the state had continued to retrofit bridges at the accelerated level 
established after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, far fewer may have collapsed 
or sustained heavy damage in the Northridge temblor and Los Angeles may have 
been spared months of disruption, said the state's Seismic Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
 But the panel said the program, burdened by budget constraints and 
administrative bottlenecks, had completed only a fraction of the needed 
strengthening when the quake collapsed seven bridges at six locations and 
damaged 233 more on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's report, scheduled to be released today, represents the first time 
that an official government body has criticized top state leaders for the 
sluggish pace of retrofitting before the Northridge quake. It also sounds a 
clear alarm that it will be several years before hundreds of bridges -- 
especially heavily traveled toll bridges -- will be considered safe in an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 While California Department of Transportation officials say they already have 
begun to implement most of the recommendations and have dramatically 
accelerated the retrofitting, the chairman of the advisory panel said there are 
disturbing signs that the program could slow down again. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there is still no clearly designated source of funds to pay $650 
million to strengthen the toll bridges. Tracking by Caltrans, he said, shows it 
is taking longer to move projects from the design to construction stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear the engineers are busy working away (but) things aren't getting 
into implementation as fast as they should," George Housner, a Caltech 
professor emeritus, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the panel fears a repeat of the pattern after each major earthquake: 
When memories of the disaster are still fresh, retrofitting proceeds at a 
frantic pace. But as recollections dim, funding is siphoned to more politically 
rewarding projects and the retrofitting program slows down. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials insisted the Administration was "fully committed" to rapid 
completion of the retrofit work and set the end of 1997 as a target. Gov. Pete 
Wilson ordered a major acceleration after articles in The Times after the 
Northridge quake revealed the slow pace of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, officials said, hundreds of engineers have been reassigned to the 
retrofit program and contracting red tape has been reduced. "Seismic retrofit 
is our highest priority for funding," the department said in response to the 
engineers' findings. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 77-page report, the advisory board pointed out that governors and 
legislatures had allowed the program to languish. The report noted that it had 
been known since the 1971 Sylmar earthquake that hundreds of the state's 
highway structures "could not survive intensive ground shaking" -- and this 
knowledge had been reinforced by the 1987 Whittier Narrows quake and Loma 
Prieta. 
</P>
<P>
 "All seven of the Northridge bridge collapses could have been prevented with 
current seismic retrofit technology," the panel wrote. "The critical element 
was not a lack of technical understanding . . . but the retrofit implementation 
time factor." 
</P>
<P>
 The board submitted its findings to Caltrans Director James van Loben Sels, 
who had asked the panel six months ago to assess the bridge strengthening 
program's performance in light of the heavy damage sustained by highway 
structures in the earthquake. Van Loben Sels said in a statement that he agreed 
"wholeheartedly with the experts' findings and recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
 The same board was directed to investigate the retrofitting program after the 
Loma Prieta quake toppled bridges and killed 43 people. The 264-page report it 
produced from that investigation was far more critical than the one presented 
to Van Loben Sels. It not only found fault with the pace of the program but 
also criticized Caltrans for its approach to retrofitting design and its 
failure to properly assess the vulnerability of vital bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Some elements of the latest report, however, amounted to a review of the 
panel's own work. Since Loma Prieta, several of the eight academics on the 
advisory panel have worked on Caltrans contracts, providing research and 
testing of new strengthening techniques. As a panel, they have continued to 
review and evaluate the agency's seismic policy and technical procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 In their report, the engineers gave the department high marks for its 
retrofitting design techniques, saying Californians can feel confident that 
newly constructed or recently strengthened bridges are safe. They emphasized 
that there was much evidence to support that finding. 
</P>
<P>
 "All structures in the region of strong shaking that were retrofitted since 
1989 performed adequately," the report said, "thus demonstrating the validity 
of the Caltrans retrofit procedures." It noted that there were 24 retrofitted 
bridges in a region of very strong shaking and 60 in an area buffeted by heavy 
ground motion. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the engineers expressed great concern that the 11 toll 
bridges in the state would be among the last to be retrofitted. Calling those 
bridges "too important to the economy of California to be left at risk to 
earthquake destruction," the panel repeatedly warned that funding problems must 
be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Retrofitting of toll bridges is proceeding at a slow pace, limited by 
budgetary constraints, even though their vulnerabilities are high," the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has maintained that the bulk of the cost should be borne by toll 
revenues, but he has met stiff resistance from Bay Area legislators who argue 
that voters approved $1 bridge tolls with the understanding that they would be 
used for other projects. Furthermore, they complain, bridge users are doubly 
taxed because they are forced to pay both tolls and gasoline taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials defended the pace of the toll bridge retrofitting, saying 
it had taken years just to figure out how to strengthen the huge, highly 
complex structures, especially the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The report recommended that Caltrans revise its system for setting 
retrofitting priorities, suggesting that instead of strengthening bridges by 
categories -- those having single columns or multiple columns, etc. -- it 
should fix "the most hazardous highway bridges . . . as quickly as practical." 
</P>
<P>
 The engineering panel said the agency's method of establishing priorities also 
had not given enough weight to certain important factors. For example, it said 
Santa Monica Freeway bridges should have had a higher priority for retrofitting 
because there were so many bridges along the highway that there was a greater 
likelihood that collapse of any one of them could shut down the entire freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the bridges that fell in the earthquake were on the Santa Monica, at La 
Cienega and Venice boulevards. Although they had been scheduled for 
retrofitting, they had not been given top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Housner said the panel also believed the agency should have paid more 
attention to soil conditions there, especially since la cienaga in Spanish 
means the swamp, indicating that the area had once been marshland.

JUDGE HALTS ABSENTEE BALLOT TALLY; ELECTION: ALLEGATION OF VOTER FRAUD BY 
DEMOCRATS PROMPTS ORDER. FEINSTEIN-HUFFINGTON CONTEST AND TWO OTHER RACES HANG 
IN BALANCE. 
</P>

 In a legal move that postpones a resolution of the close U.S. Senate race and 
two down-to-the-wire legislative contests, a Pasadena Superior Court judge said 
he has signed a temporary restraining order halting the counting of Los Angeles 
County's absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Coleman A. Swart said Sunday night that he signed the order Saturday 
after a request from a Glendale Republican activist who claimed Democratic 
voter fraud in last week's election. A Superior Court hearing is set for today 
on the matter, Swart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The order affects three races: 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein leads Rep. Mike Huffington by 123,610 votes, with 
about 500,000 absentee ballots uncounted. Most of those are in Los Angeles 
County, which Feinstein carried by 11% Tuesday and by a 1% margin of absentee 
ballots already counted. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, incumbent Democratic Assemblywoman Betty Karnette led 
Republican Steve Kuykendall by 64 votes. A Republican victory in the race would 
deadlock the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 36th Congressional District, Republican Susan Brooks led Democratic 
incumbent Jane Harman by 93 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his decision to sign the order, Swart said, "I will not comment on 
a pending case." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Allen Brandstater, who said he had worked for Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich and as a consultant in local races, alleged vote fraud by Democrats 
in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich, who last month asked the county registrar to investigate 
constituents' allegations of unlawful registration by illegal immigrants, 
joined Brandstater's declaration to Swart, according to his chief deputy, Tony 
Silver. The district attorney's office began investigating the matter at the 
request of the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandstater said he had no role in Huffington's campaign, and a Huffington 
campaign spokeswoman agreed, and added that the campaign's attorneys advised 
her not to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata questioned the allegations and said he 
believes the action to be a partisan delaying maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 While several news organizations have declared Feinstein the winner, she has 
not formally declared victory, nor has Huffington conceded.

SPEAKER HOPES FOR ENCORE AS HOUDINI; POLITICS: REPUBLICANS ARE ITCHING TO OUST 
LONGTIME DEMOCRATIC ASSEMBLY LEADER WILLIE BROWN, BUT HE IS MUSTERING ALL HIS 
LEGENDARY SAVVY TO STAY IN POWER. 
</P>

<P>
 Ecstatic Republicans in the state Assembly are rejoicing over their crushing 
victories in last Tuesday's election and are ready to hand Willie Brown -- the 
wily veteran lawmaker and symbol of longtime Democratic preeminence -- his 
walking papers. 
</P>
<P>
 But they just might be moving too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown didn't become the state's longest-reigning Speaker or one of the 
nation's top African American officials by happenstance. Ever the consummate 
politician, Brown is at his best when his own political survival is at stake, 
as it is now. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative GOP Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy, long a thorn in Brown's side, 
knows Brown as a master political magician and tactician whose acumen and 
instincts make him a formidable opponent. He is one step ahead of his political 
enemies, and what you see is not necessarily what's there. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, Mountjoy cracked, has gotten out of more boxes than Harry Houdini. 
</P>
<P>
 As the longest-serving member of the Assembly, Brown, 60, has an encyclopedic 
knowledge of the lower house's rules and how to manipulate them to his best 
advantage. What he knows perhaps better than anyone is what motivates members 
on both sides of the aisle -- greed, ambition or power. 
</P>
<P>
 He keeps members of the Assembly happy -- even intervening, as he did a few 
years ago, to help a Republican assemblywoman whose daughter had received a 
number of traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a liberal, he is not an ideologue or a policy wonk. Keeping the 
speakership, and its clout and its prestige, is what seemingly drives Brown 
most of all. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not going to let this go without a fight," acknowledged Phil Perry, 
spokesman for Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte, 38, who was first elected 
to the lower house in 1990. "He'll try every trick that's available to him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brulte-led GOP scored major advances on Election Day, gaining at least 
seven seats and, at minimum, deadlocking the 80-member Assembly 40-40. But it 
takes 41 votes to elect a new Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 When absentee ballots are counted, Brulte expects to pick up one seat now held 
by Democrats in the Long Beach area and possibly another close race in 
Stockton. Democrats still believe they have an outside chance to capture two 
Monterey-area seats where their candidates trailed. 
</P>
<P>
 While Democratic Assembly employees scurry to compile resumes for job-hunting, 
Brown is showing no signs of cracking. In fact, he seems to be relishing the 
fight, bantering with reporters and asserting that, when all is said and done 
and the votes are counted Dec. 5 when the new Legislature convenes, he will 
remain Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone else has 41 (votes)," he declared late last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging from the civil rights movement of the 1960s, Brown, the glib and 
flamboyant lawyer, the product of a segregated childhood in Texas, has become a 
towering figure in California politics. As Speaker since 1980, he has adroitly 
wielded the power of the office to raise tens of millions of dollars from 
special interests on behalf of Democratic candidates, who then pledge their 
loyalty to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, former Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale secretly 
complained to the FBI about Brown's fund-raising practices, according to 
documents made available to The Times earlier this year. In six conversations 
in the mid-1980s, Nolan told agents that Brown manipulated the system to raise 
campaign money. But Brown was never charged with wrongdoing in the lengthy 
federal probe of corruption in the Capitol, while, ironically, Nolan earlier 
this year pleaded guilty to political corruption charges and is now in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 As Speaker, Brown has not enforced a strict liberal ideology on his members, 
more often working out compromises between his caucus and Republicans. During 
his 14-year reign, Brown has sought to allow his members to take credit for 
major bills. His own legislative credits have been, in comparison, more modest, 
limited to pushing a mandatory seat belt law and, in recent years, 
collaborating with Republican Gov. Pete Wilson to help businesses and to hammer 
out state budget deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in his legislative career that began in 1964, Brown helped push 
through a bill to decriminalize marijuana use in small amounts and a "sexual 
bill of rights" that legalized all forms of sex between consenting adults. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, some colleagues maintained that behind the scenes Brown mostly 
acted as a "groundskeeper" focusing on holding his Democratic majority 
together, while not taking strong stands that would split his caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Election Day Republican tidal wave, Brown's campaign machine 
uncharacteristically sputtered and failed to get out the Democratic vote, 
leaving his colleagues feeling as if they just survived the St. Valentine's Day 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Brown holds on to the Speakership, Democrats predict he will need to 
take a new tack. Citing the closely balanced power in the house between 
Republicans and Democrats, Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Venice) said that 
"regardless of who's Speaker, there's going to have to be closer bipartisan 
cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
 Without collaboration, she said, "nothing will get done, and that's not what 
regular people want." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Brown was elevated in 1980 to the Speakership with the help of 
conservative Republicans. He emerged on top after a protracted fight between 
two others, Democratic Assemblymen Leo T. McCarthy of San Francisco, who was 
Speaker, and Howard A. Berman of Los Angeles. After striking a deal with the 
Republican leadership, Brown defeated Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years later, Brown beat back a prolonged challenge by five rebel 
Democrats known as the Gang of Five. Brown again won by seeking out 
Republicans, courting and persuading a handful not to vote against him. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rules of the game changed dramatically in 1990, when voters approved 
term limits. Political longevity was outlawed and with it much of the 
carrot-and-stick approach traditionally used by legislative leaders to keep 
lawmakers in line. 
</P>
<P>
 It's now unclear whether Democrats elected under term limits will put up with 
parliamentary maneuvers to keep Brown in power. They too, after all, are lame 
ducks. The Capitol is rife with speculation about Brown's plans. In typical 
Brown fashion when a major political problem is afoot, he has been silent about 
what he intends to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats speculate that he will try to reconvene the old Assembly, where 
Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 47-33 margin, to change the house rules 
for his benefit and delay a Speakership vote until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Others suggest that he will pull out an old weapon and strike a deal with one 
or two Republicans, including Assemblyman Paul Horcher (R-Diamond Bar), getting 
them to defect from the GOP ranks. Over Republican objections, Brown in the 
past put Horcher in a key committee vice chairmanship, allowing the maverick 
Republican to have extra staff and prestige. 
</P>
<P>
 As a last-ditch measure to salvage his Speakership, his allies suggest, Brown 
might propose a power-sharing arrangement with the GOP under which he would 
remain Speaker but would split the house staff evenly. Willie Brown's Career 
(Southland Edition, A17) 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) has been Speaker of the Assembly 
for a record 14 years. He is now fighting a serious Republican challenge to 
retain the post. One of the most colorful and controversial figures in 
California political history, Brown is generally considered second only to the 
governor in political power. He is the longest-serving member of the Assembly, 
his career encompassing parts of four decades. Here is Brown's political career 
at a glance.

CARJACKER DIES IN S.F. SHOOTOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wearing bulletproof vests and military fatigues, two gunmen ran down a street 
here Sunday, firing several assault-style weapons, shooting a paramedic and two 
police officers -- one critically -- before being shot by police, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One officer was in critical condition at San Francisco General Hospital with a 
head wound. The other, shot in the chest, was in serious condition, said 
nursing supervisor Gloria Rodriguez. One gunman was fatally shot at the scene, 
officials said. The other was reported in stable condition with a leg wound. 
</P>
<P>
 The paramedic was in stable condition with a wound in the left forearm, 
Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb squad was called to the scene to check the dead gunman's body, which 
police said may have had explosives on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said the exchange of gunfire lasted as long as 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident started with a carjacking in Mountain View, south of San 
Francisco, police said. The two men then drove into San Francisco, where they 
carjacked a BMW being driven by a woman near the corner of Franklin and Pine 
streets around 6:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 When police responded to calls of the carjacking, the pair opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen ran down the street with as many as six weapons, some of them 
automatic, according to Officer Mark Madsen. 
</P>
<P>
 They fired and reloaded as they went, getting off as many as 200 rounds before 
being shot down, an officer told KCBS radio. 
</P>
<P>
 A police spokesman said the first officer was shot upon arriving at the scene. 
The other was shot on a rooftop. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunfire exchange left cars riddled with bullet holes and windows 
shattered. Shell casings littered the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was crazy, it was constant," said Mimi Mehrabi, who lives on the block in 
the Pacific Heights district. "It was a really scary thing. Cops were hiding 
behind buildings and behind their cars." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen's identities were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Frightened residents took cover in their apartments during the hail of 
bullets, and customers at a nearby restaurant hit the floor.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: PICKING OVER DEBRIS FROM A TIDAL WAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson can't run for President. Kathleen Brown likely will think 
hard before running again for anything. And the Democratic Party should run in 
a different direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some postscripts to the election: 
</P>
<P>
 It's fantasy to think of California's governor as a presidential candidate in 
1996. Wilson now is high on every list of prospects. But there is no way he can 
run -- at least as a loyal Republican -- with a Democratic lieutenant governor 
(Gray Davis) poised to pounce on his office. It would be an embarrassing issue 
in every GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some Republican!" his opponents would say. "Can you really trust a guy who 
would hand over our largest state to Jerry Brown's former chief of staff?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in fact, publicly has ruled out running. But his name won't be 
scratched from any lists, for several reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 He has a big base -- a state with one-fifth of the electoral votes needed to 
capture the presidency. He has just staged an incredible comeback to win 
reelection. More than any other politician, he has become identified with the 
popular battle against illegal immigration and also has fought for welfare 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 And beyond those reasons, pundits need names for their lists. They also need 
an excuse to fly to California, especially in winter. "We really ought to go 
out there and check up on Wilson," they'll tell their editors. "He's on the 
'top tier' list." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's year will be 2000, at age 67, if he has had a good second term and 
there's an open race for the presidency. For that to occur, President Clinton 
needs to be reelected in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The gurus say it's too early to close the book on Brown's political career. 
But she didn't show much promise in this election. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did she lose by a whopping 15 points, women voted against her by nine 
points, a Times exit poll found. More Brown voters regarded her as "the lesser 
of two evils" than a candidate they liked. Their main reason for supporting her 
was "Wilson's record." Far fewer people cited her "ideas" and "leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's family -- presumably brother Jerry -- was heavy baggage. One in five 
said "the Brown family record" was a major influence on their vote, and 70% of 
these people backed Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The spin from the Brown camp is that she never had a chance because her money 
ran out and it was a Republican year. But her strategists spent an enormous 
amount, an estimated $24 million. And the size of her drubbing cannot be blamed 
entirely on a swing of the political pendulum. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's missteps in blowing a big lead could fill a book. But it boils down to 
her failing to articulate why she would have been a better governor than the 
incumbent. The suspicion is she never thought it through -- that she decided to 
run two years ago when Wilson was at his weakest, believed voters would prefer 
anybody over him and didn't take the time to sort out where she really wanted 
to lead the state. 
</P>
<P>
 She was relatively inexperienced, but Ronald Reagan was even less experienced 
when he beat her father 28 years ago. Reagan, however, was propelled by strong 
core beliefs. If Brown possesses such motivating forces, she kept them hidden. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the campaign, I heard her at a Pasadena church speak passionately 
about the "epidemic" of teen-age pregnancy. She was convincing and moving. 
Unfortunately, another part of her speech was more typical: a boring treatise 
on government management. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's next political venture perhaps should be a run in Los Angeles County 
-- for City Council or supervisor or mayor, if Richard Riordan moves up. 
Riordan for vice president in 1996? Governor in 1998? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic Party keeps fighting for people who don't vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The very poor -- those making less than $20,000 a year -- amounted to only 14% 
of the electorate. People earning more than $60,000 comprised 37%. 
Self-described liberals were 17%; conservatives 37%. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos were 8%, blacks 5%, Asians 4% and whites 81%. "If Latinos wouldn't 
turn out on Proposition 187, what will bring them into the political process?" 
wondered state Democratic Chairman Bill Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Whites voted for Wilson and for Proposition 187 by 26-point margins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats' liberal agenda -- activist government based on income 
redistribution and Byzantine regulation -- has not been selling in the ballot 
booths. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters -- as if operating TV remotes -- are "party surfing." They'll watch the 
GOP for awhile. And if they don't like that program, their next stop may be a 
third party. 
</P>
<P>
 The first party to genuinely fight for middle-class and working-class voters 
wins. More Capitol Journal

CITY DIVIDED BY MOVE TO LET RESIDENTS CARRY GUNS; SAFETY: STOCKTON WEIGHS IDEA 
OPPOSED BY MAYOR, POLICE CHIEF. ABOUT 130,000 PEOPLE COULD BE ELIGIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Councilman Nick Rust, a card-carrying member of the National Rifle Assn., 
is pushing a new plan to fight crime: Give all law-abiding citizens the right 
to carry a hidden weapon whenever they leave their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when many California communities are trying to get guns off the 
streets, Rust has proposed a city ordinance that would allow as many as 130,000 
people -- most of Stockton's adult population -- to obtain a concealed weapon 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ultimate goal is to make Stockton a safer place for people to live," said 
the 48-year-old councilman and management consultant. "What I'm saying is, 
people have the right to defend themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has sharply divided this San Joaquin Valley city, which gained 
national attention five years ago when a gunman opened fire with an assault 
rifle on children in a schoolyard, killing five and wounding 29. The tragedy 
inspired city, state and federal assault rifle bans. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton's mayor and police chief, as well as national gun control groups, 
strongly oppose the proposed ordinance -- which would be the first in 
California to make it easier to obtain concealed weapon permits. They argue 
that arming the citizenry would lead to deadlier domestic violence and a 
greater number of accidental shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything we know about firearms misuse and abuse tells us this sort of 
approach is insanity," said Sandy Cooney, western regional director of Handgun 
Control Inc. "It can only do one thing, and that is add to the epidemic of 
injury and death from guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever its merits, foes and supporters agree that the ordinance has a good 
chance of passing when it comes before the seven-member City Council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has struck a chord with many townspeople who are fed up with 
crime and the difficulty police have protecting residents. "Criminals are going 
to carry guns no matter what," said Michael Anthony Dunn, manager of the 
Stockton Gun Exchange. "Why not give the law-abiding citizens a chance?" 
</P>
<P>
 With the Stockton proposal, the National Rifle Assn. and other supporters hope 
to bring to California the same kind of standards already approved by nine 
states, which greatly expanded the number of people who can carry loaded 
weapons on their person or in their car. 
</P>
<P>
 Current laws allow citizens to keep loaded guns in their homes or businesses 
without a permit, but 70% of crimes occur elsewhere, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the value of this program is to put the criminal on notice that 
law-abiding citizens of a community are no longer going to be unarmed prey," 
said Dale Thurston, a leader of Citizens for a Better Stockton, a group 
affiliated with the NRA that offers gun-handling and safety courses. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, state law leaves it up to police chiefs and county sheriffs to 
decide who should be granted a concealed weapon permit. Such permits allow the 
holder to carry a hidden, loaded weapon anywhere in the state, except in 
restricted areas such as airports and courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, applicants must be of good moral character and have no felony 
convictions or history of mental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Most jurisdictions issue relatively few permits and require applicants to 
demonstrate a valid reason to carry a concealed weapon. In all of Los Angeles 
County, with a population of 9.2 million, the Sheriff's Department and city 
police chiefs gave out 618 concealed weapon permits through 1993 -- one for 
every 14,936 people. 
</P>
<P>
 In Stockton, Police Chief Ed Chavez issues permits only to applicants who can 
prove a need for a concealed gun, such as receiving threats or carrying large 
amounts of cash. In the past 18 months, the chief has issued four new permits, 
bringing the city's total to 207 for a population of 230,000 -- one for every 
1,111 people. 
</P>
<P>
 But under the Stockton proposal, gun owners could qualify for a concealed 
weapon permit without having to prove any special need. Rust -- who recently 
received approval for his own permit after receiving threats -- argues that the 
level of crime in the city is sufficient need for anyone to carry a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Rust's ordinance would strip away the chief's discretion and require him to 
issue a permit to anyone who did not fall into certain undesirable groups, such 
as convicted felons, the mentally disturbed, illegal immigrants and known gang 
members, drug users and people with alcohol problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants also would be required to pay a fee and pass a gun safety course, 
such as the one offered by Citizens for a Better Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez said the measure would tie his hands and could endanger his officers 
during routine encounters with the public. If the ordinance passes, he said, he 
is likely to challenge it in court before agreeing to issue permits on a wide 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a certain population that carries weapons illegally," the chief said. 
"I don't think the way to solve that is to arm everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the measure cite Florida as an example of how the law could 
work. Florida, with a population of 13.7 million, passed a similar measure in 
1987 and has since issued more than 227,000 concealed weapon permits -- one for 
every 60 people. Proponents say violent crime has dropped in the state since 
passage of the law and contend that accidental shootings have not increased. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics and law enforcement officials say data has not been collected to 
show whether the law has contributed to a decrease in crime or resulted in a 
greater number of accidental and domestic shootings. "There's no way to tell," 
said Detective Juan del Castillo, a spokesman for the Metro-Dade Police 
Department in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the movement to arm members of the general public has gained 
strength with the passage of similar laws in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, 
Arizona, North Dakota, South Dakota, Maine, West Virginia and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet during the same period, a number of big cities have initiated a variety of 
gun exchange and buy-back programs designed to take guns out of circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Foes of the Stockton proposal say it will bring back the days of the Wild West 
and prompt shoot-outs in the streets among armed civilians. They also fear that 
children will be more likely to die in tragic accidents as they find guns in 
more accessible places, such as purses and auto glove compartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics contend that even Patrick Purdy, the deranged drifter who gunned down 
34 children and a teacher at Stockton's Cleveland Elementary School in 1989, 
theoretically could have qualified for a concealed weapon permit under the 
standards of the proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think it's good public policy for people to carry guns around on 
the streets or in their cars when we have a culture with such a high incidence 
of alcohol problems and people walking around with undiagnosed mental 
problems," said Andrew McGuire, executive director of the Pacific Center for 
Violence Prevention in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton Mayor Joan Darrah says the city has succeeded in reducing violent 
crime by 5.5% in the last year by adding 125 police officers to the force. She 
and other city leaders worry that passage of Rust's proposal will perpetuate 
Stockton's poor image. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of perception are we going to send to our community, the state and 
the nation?" Chavez asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the measure also cite the accidental shooting of 14-year-old 
Matilda Kaye Crabtree by her father last week in Louisiana as an example of the 
kind of incident that will occur more frequently if the citizenry is armed. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager hid in a closet as a practical joke and jumped out, saying "boo" 
to scare her father, who had not expected her to be home. Armed with a .357 
Magnum, he shot her in the neck. "I love you, Daddy," she said just before she 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates of the proposal counter that citizens cannot expect the police 
to guard them from violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the rationale for the proposal, Rust said, is that "the bad guys" 
won't know who among their targets might be packing a pistol and will think 
twice about mugging and robbing people. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on experiences in other states, Rust and Thurston predict that no more 
than one in every 25 Stockton residents would receive permits -- a total of 
about 9,200 gun owners. And they insist that good training of civilians will 
prevent the kind of accidents that opponents fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who are opposing this are on the edge of hysteria," the councilman 
said.

SWEDEN FOLLOWS AUSTRIA, FINLAND WITH VOTE TO JOIN EUROPEAN UNION; SCANDINAVIA: 
THE STRONG 52.2% APPROVAL COMES AS A SURPRISE AFTER PRE-BALLOTING POLLS SHOWED 
AN EVEN SPLIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the end of a long and intensely emotional campaign, Sweden on Sunday voted 
solidly in favor of abandoning its Arctic isolation and joining the European 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden's approval follows similar yes votes in Austria and Finland this year 
and is expected to give a boost to a referendum at the end of the month in 
neighboring Norway, where opposition has been strong. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of all four countries would make the EU the world's largest and 
richest free-trade bloc, surpassing North America, and could help speed the 
integration of the Eastern and Central European countries hoping to join. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote -- billed as the most important decision this century for Sweden's 
8.7 million citizens -- was 52.2% to 46.9%, with nearly 1% of the ballots left 
blank. The strong approval came as a surprise, with polls right up to voting 
day showing an even split and a fifth of voters still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pro-EU campaign launched a strong last-minute push, with Social 
Democratic Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson and his political rival, former Prime 
Minister Carl Bildt, arguing on the same side during a nationally televised 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a happy day," Carlsson said at a news conference following the vote. 
"I believe we can be good for Europe. We will be an active partner. This brings 
us new possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden, a fiercely independent country connected to continental Europe 
primarily by ferries, was divided over whether joining forces with its 
neighbors would mean more or less employment, democracy and social welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues of the campaign dug deep into the Swedish psyche. Fear ran high 
that entering the EU would compromise the country's commitment to political 
neutrality, human equality and environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
 For 150 years, Swedes have pursued a policy of neutrality that kept them out 
of two world wars and made them a buffer between the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and Soviet Bloc nations. They created a capitalist country with a 
generous welfare state that made them a kind of third alternative to communism 
and U.S.-style free-marketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Swedes have argued lately that neutrality is an outdated policy in 
the wake of the Cold War. And Sweden's economy is reeling from two decades of 
slow growth that has resulted in 14% unemployment and a budget deficit near 13% 
of the gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-EU campaign, supported by most political leaders, big business and the 
country's largest national newspapers, clearly outspent opponents in pressing 
their case that this was the country's only chance to turn around the economy 
and prevent cuts in the country's generous social welfare system. A no vote, 
they warned, would drive up interest rates and scare off investment to EU 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we want social welfare, we have got to get to work and pay taxes. The 
public sector is not self-propelling. It needs a locomotive," Carlsson argued 
in the key debate before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 He also argued that Sweden must have a voice in European economic and security 
policy decisions that inevitably affect the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want us to be there when decisions are made, not just standing by hoping 
Finland and Denmark represent our interests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Support was greatest in the cities, among office workers and professionals. 
Opposition was strongest among environmentalists, farmers, workers and many 
women, all of whom feared economic intervention from Brussels, the seat of the 
EU, and a loss of sovereignty over political decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In all three Scandinavian countries voting on the issue this year, opposition 
has been strong in the Arctic north and other rural areas. Sweden's farmers 
said they would lose government subsidies that allow them to build hothouses to 
heat crops. 
</P>
<P>
 One issue among women was equal rights. Swedish women look at Germany, where 
half as many women work outside the home, and fear for their jobs and child 
care services. 
</P>
<P>
 Agnetha Stark, a leader of the anti-EU campaign, said Carlsson and Bildt's 
"trust us" strategy had won over voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnout was high on a cold but sunny November day. In Stockholm's Old Town, 
Taeppas Fugelberg, an author and journalist, voted against the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the question of democracy being transferred from Stockholm to 
Brussels is rather disgusting," he said, adding that Sweden "is like a 
refrigerator full of yummies, and the rest of Europe will empty it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Raoul Toenisson, the director of an export company, voted with the 
majority for integration. "The world is globalizing. I have a vision of a 
united Europe, and this is the first step," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be a part of Europe," concurred banker Per Harrison. "Switzerland 
is out (of the EU), but they are a very, very rich country. We are borrowing 
money, and they are lending. That's the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden's vote is non-binding, but the Parliament is virtually certain to 
ratify it. 
</P>
<P>
 If the three Scandinavian countries join in January along with Austria, the EU 
will become a bloc of 16 countries with open borders for trade, movement of 
capital and citizens of member countries. The union also seeks a common 
currency and security policy.

 Many Swedes feared that their country is too small to have a real voice in the 
EU. The Scandinavian countries may form a bloc with Denmark, already a member, 
that gives them 13 votes on a 90-seat European Council of Ministers. That is 
not enough to form a blocking minority, but it is more than Germany, which is 
seen as the big brother of the EU. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sweden has cooperated with NATO peacekeeping missions, the country is 
not likely to join NATO. But political observers do not rule out participation 
in an eventual EU security organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote is likely to leave a lot of discontent in a country so committed to 
consensus that the government helped to finance both the yes and no campaigns. 
Carlsson, whose party was divided over the issue, allowed Cabinet members to 
campaign against integration.

SCIENCE; RISING TO THE TOP FOR A NEW LOOK AT AN ANCIENT FOREST; FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN NORTH AMERICA, RESEARCHERS WILL BE ABLE TO STUDY TREES FROM ABOVE WITH 
THE HELP OF A MECHANICAL CRANE.

<P>
 The silence of an ancient forest has given way to the sounds of workers 
erecting a giant steel crane that will give scientists an extraordinary 
opportunity to study the great old cedars and Douglas firs that tower over this 
pristine land. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed late this year, the 240-foot-tall crane will lift scientists 
above the forest canopy to carry out long-term research on a part of the forest 
they rarely get to study -- the top. 
</P>
<P>
 The crane is a dream come true for some scientists, who were beginning to 
wonder if it would take longer to get a permit to erect the crane than it did 
to grow the forest they want to study. 
</P>
<P>
 For years scientists tried to acquire a permit to build the crane in 
Washington's Olympic National Forest, but residents of that area feared that 
the research might lead to the discovery of another spotted owl or some other 
creature that would further curtail logging. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with threats from some opponents, officials finally killed the project 
for the Olympic Peninsula, one of the most lush forest canopies in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crane has finally found a home here on the northern shores of the 
Columbia River, in a community long accustomed to scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down here, reaction has been very positive," said David Shaw, a forest 
pathologist with the University of Washington and manager of the crane project. 
The crane is being erected in the Wind River Experimental Forest, which is part 
of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest just north of the Columbia River Gorge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This land has been designated an experimental forest since the early 1900s," 
Shaw said. "Research is not that foreign to these people." 
</P>
<P>
 The crane is on the cutting edge of a new technology, and it will be the first 
such facility in North America. Its only rival is a crane in the Panamanian 
forest, although others are under study for Europe and South America. The crane 
can take us to places we can't get to any other way," Shaw said. "And it can do 
it repeatedly, very safely." 
</P>
<P>
 The $1-million crane is enjoying a rebirth. It was used to construct the new 
downtown library in San Francisco, and soon it will be used to carry scientists 
to the treetops to study everything from pollination to plant disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that it is becoming a fact, the use of a crane to study forest canopies 
seems an obvious solution to a difficult problem, and Shaw said he expects to 
see cranes proliferate around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the best way for scientists to study the top of the forest was to 
climb the trees and carry out short-term research, but that frequently led to 
inconsistent and interrupted studies. And some of them fell out of the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Climbers do get killed," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 So little is known about the upper forest canopy that some of the research 
will be quite basic. Shaw, for example, plans to study the dwarf mistletoe 
found in the huge Western hemlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's considered one of the most important pests in the West," he said, and it 
is blamed for the death of many trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very difficult species to study," because it is found in the tops 
of the 200-foot-tall trees. "We don't even know how it is pollinated, whether 
by insects or wind. That's extremely basic, but it's not understood." 
</P>
<P>
 The crane, funded by Congress through the U.S. Forest Service, will be 
operational for at least five years, and scientists hope to keep it up for 10 
to 20 years. Any scientist with a need to study the forest canopy is eligible 
to use it, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those already lining up are entomologists, who have had a difficult time 
studying insects that inhabit the upper canopy. The crane will allow them to 
return to precisely the same spot, season after season, to determine the impact 
of various insects on the forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Tree physiologists and geneticists also are expected to use the crane 
extensively. In the past, much of their research has been carried out on 
smaller specimens in greenhouses, and it has been very difficult to study the 
tops of old-growth trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners have taken special precautions in the process of building the crane 
to keep from destroying the forest they want to study. A 2,000-foot-long road 
has been built through the forest, and it is so narrow that heavy equipment 
practically grazes the 450-year-old trees as it is moved to the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Erecting the crane is a bit tricky. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of hard," said construction supervisor Jim Brandner. "The problem 
is, it's not self-erecting." 
</P>
<P>
 A 360-ton portable crane had to be trucked to the site to lift the heavy steel 
components into place. Brandner's crew recently completed pouring more than 
1,000 tons of concrete into a 12-foot-deep hole to provide a footing for the 
crane. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 240-foot tower is completed, possibly by early December, a horizontal 
boom will be added, and it will sweep 360 degrees over 5.6 acres of forest. A 
gondola below the boom will carry scientists to any part of that area they want 
to study. 
</P>
<P>
 That will give them access to the tops of about 1,000 trees, mostly Douglas 
fir, Western hemlock and cedar. Some of the trees are nearly 500 years old, 
making it truly an old-growth forest.

UPDATE; JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TEAM SETS PRECEDENTS IN DISABLED ACCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A health spa in North Carolina excluded a man with cerebral palsy from using 
its pool and whirlpool but later agreed he could enter the water if he wore a 
protective helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 When the patron complained to the government that he was being denied his 
rights under the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Justice Department went 
to bat for him and convinced the spa's managers that the helmet represented an 
unnecessary, illegal exclusion based on a misperception of his disability. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of several hundred settlements the department has won under the 
public accommodations section of the landmark statute, which has been in effect 
since January, 1992. A team of lawyers in the department's civil rights 
division, headed by John L. Wodatch, has been achieving victories mainly 
through formal or informal settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers have the power to file civil complaints to force compliance with 
the law -- and often do. Earlier this year, in a still-unresolved lawsuit, the 
department sued a large hotel on the island of Maui on grounds that it had 
failed to remove architectural barriers preventing access to its 540 guest 
rooms and cottages by people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some outside advocates, such as Alan Reich of the National Organization on 
Disability, contend that the department has not won enough settlements: about 
300, compared with 2,800 complaints received. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wodatch said: "We try to pick the most important issues and choose cases 
that will set precedents." 
</P>
<P>
 Wodatch said many hotels, restaurants and other facilities that serve the 
public -- as well as government offices -- agreed to make changes voluntarily 
after being contacted by Wodatch and his team. They include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Quality Hotel in Washington agreed to pay a complainant $10,000 and to 
train all its employees in the law's requirements after staff members refused 
to permit a guest to use a motorized scooter to get to his room. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Hotel Inter-Continental in New York is making numerous changes in the 
next five years, such as improving access to the front lobby and ballroom, 
making elevators more accessible to people with vision impairments and offering 
closed-caption decoders on television sets in some rooms for deaf and other 
hearing-impaired guests. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Boston, Anthony's Pier 4 Restaurant, one of the largest in the country, 
is reconstructing its entrance for better access, putting in a ramp to the 
outdoor patio and installing a mechanical wheelchair lift to its banquet and 
meeting rooms on the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Denver restaurant accessible only by a steep flight of stairs or by 
narrow, winding corridors has agreed to prepare and deliver meals to people 
with disabilities who live within three miles and to advertise the service. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a settlement announced in September, Avis Inc. agreed to provide cars 
with hand controls for customers with disabilities. Justice Department 
officials said the voluntary agreement came after complaints were filed against 
Avis, the nation's second-largest car rental company, and 10 other firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials said they hoped the agreement would set a standard for the 
car rental industry. 
</P>
<P>
 No facility is too small to escape scrutiny. A Louisiana motel is lowering 
part of its front desk for guests who use wheelchairs and is equipping two 
rooms with roll-in showers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all settlements require expensive accommodations. A Berkeley bookstore 
agreed to provide sign-language interpreters -- upon request -- for its poetry 
readings. 
</P>
<P>
 And a Texas movie theater has changed its "no outside food" policy after it 
prevented a woman from bringing in cookies for her diabetic child. The theater 
now makes exceptions in cases of medical need. 
</P>
<P>
 And several cities, including Los Angeles, have entered into settlements with 
the Justice Department to improve service on their 911 emergency numbers for 
residents who are deaf, hard of hearing or who have speech impairments.

CLINTON VISIT REVIVES TIES WITH PHILIPPINES AFTER PULLOUT; ASIA: THE TRIP COMES 
TWO YEARS AFTER AMERICA'S BITTER MILITARY EXODUS. MANILA NOW FOCUSES ON 
DEVELOPMENT AND REGIONAL RELATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 America always seems to dream of the Asian mainland, but it always returns to 
the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, in the person of President Clinton, America symbolically came back to 
the Philippines on Sunday, just two years after a bitter exodus from the 
military bases it had occupied for nearly a century. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the tone was less grandiose than that of the most famous returnee 
here, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who once said that the Philippines "fastened me 
with a grip that never relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 MacArthur left the Philippines for Australia in 1942 promising to come back. 
He kept his promise by wading ashore at Leyte two years later with the words: 
"I have returned. . . . Rally to me! . . . The guidance of divine God points 
the way. . . . Follow in his name to the Holy Grail of righteous victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's American return under Clinton was far more modest. But his arrival 
here was nonetheless welcomed, particularly after the bitterness of the 1992 
American departure from Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay Naval Base. It 
represents "a revival of the old friendship between our two peoples," Manila 
Mayor Angelo Lim said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a signal to the world that the Philippines is back on the economic 
map," said Irene Natividad, head of the Philippine-American Friendship Assn. 
and one of several prominent Philippine Americans who flew back to Manila for 
Clinton's visit, the first here by a U.S. President in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, America came back Sunday to a different Philippines, one much more 
preoccupied with Asia and with the task of economic development than was the 
former colony that America left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have found ourselves back in Asia," said former Philippine Vice President 
Emmanuel Pelaez, who served as ambassador to the United States during the 
closing of the U.S. bases. "Both Japan and Taiwan are transferring their 
factories here, where land and wages are cheaper. You know, the Japanese prefer 
(workers who speak) English." 
</P>
<P>
 The signs of change were evident at Subic Bay, which had been the center of 
U.S. naval operations in the Pacific from the Boxer Rebellion at the beginning 
of this century to the Persian Gulf War of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher attended a signing 
ceremony for a new commercial venture at Subic Bay, one in which Federal 
Express will set up a new regional hub for its Asian operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the investment community, the Philippines are looked on as a promising 
opportunity now," said Richard Solomon, a former U.S. ambassador to the 
Philippines. "The things we always hoped would some day work for them are 
beginning to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have an English-speaking work force. They don't have the political 
uncertainties of, say, Indonesia. And (Philippine President Fidel V.) Ramos 
seems to have done a good job of getting the security situation under control." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, not everything has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the runways at Clark Air Base is ready for use. The rest of the 
base is still covered with volcanic dust, the continuing legacy of the 
catastrophic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts of the Philippine government to recover the billions of dollars in 
assets it estimates were stolen by the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos and 
his cronies are still bogged down in the courts, not much closer to success now 
than when the litigation started eight years ago. "You know, lawyers can make 
things last forever," Pelaez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of Manila are still lined with hovels. The streets are still full of 
jeepneys, the colorful converted buses, jeeps and carts that are the country's 
best-known mass transit and most popular folk-art form. And the handouts given 
to visitors by the U.S. Embassy contain security warnings that portray a 
different reality from the one the Philippines presents to potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If in a taxi . . . do NOT allow the driver to pick up additional passengers," 
the warning says. "Stay alert. Be prepared to take evasive action. Also, if you 
have packages with you and the driver asks you to get out to 'check the tire,' 
you will never see him OR your packages again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pinatubo eruption started the U.S. exodus from the Philippines, because it 
virtually eliminated any American interest in staying on at Clark Air Base. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Washington and Manila were in the midst of negotiations over the 
future of the bases but were far apart on money. The George Bush Administration 
was offering $450 million a year, and the Philippines was demanding $1.2 
billion. The gap was never closed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 16, 1991, the Philippine Senate voted 12 to 11 to turn down a new 
agreement, effectively ordering the Americans to leave. That was only the 
beginning of the acrimonious end. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush wrote then-Philippine President Corazon Aquino, asking for a two- or 
three-year period for a gradual, orderly departure. As Pelaez sadly recalled 
Sunday, "We didn't reply. . . . The (Philippine) nationalists wanted everything 
out in one year. And so the United States pulled out a lot of things that could 
have been left. There was some bad blood." 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 24, 1992, the last U.S. warship sailed out of Subic Bay to strains of 
"Bye-bye, G.I." on the shores. That ended 94 years of U.S. military presence in 
the Philippines, setting the tone for a new, more distant relationship between 
the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bases were the last remnants of the colonial era," said Solomon, who 
served as the U.S. ambassador in Manila when the military facilities were 
closed. "It is a much less special relationship now, if it is special at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Clinton's arrival here brought forth some wariness that the United 
States might be trying to revive the old paternalistic relationship in a 
country that has learned to live on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would do well for Mr. Clinton not to act too much like the Great White 
Father," warned an editorial in one newspaper, the Philippine Star. "The 
Philippines is no longer a child that needs a pat on the back." 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, at least, the United States and the Philippines seem to 
want different things from each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philippines seeks trade and investment from the United States. For its 
part, the United States sees the Philippines as an important democratic ally in 
its ideological skirmishes with Asian states such as China and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton evoked that struggle here Sunday. "The great wave of democracy that 
has swept the world in our time began here in the Philippines," he said, 
referring to the 1986 "people power" movement that drove Marcos from office and 
made Aquino president. "What happened here . . . encouraged events in countries 
like Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the common democratic ties, the United States still thinks 
about security links with the Philippines, perhaps with U.S. forces given some 
access to Philippine military facilities -- such as the United States enjoys in 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 "My assumption was always that after a cooling-off period of a couple of 
years, (the Philippines) might want to have us around again, particularly if 
the Chinese were exercising their weight in Asia," Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is for the future. Clinton's visit Sunday focused on the past and on 
revival of the historic ties. The President talked of the Philippines as "our 
oldest friend in Asia, a nation that has done so much to enrich the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the back of the cemetery at which Clinton spoke was Francisco T. 
Dandrido, a veteran who fought in a Philippine artillery unit with U.S. troops 
at Corregidor when they surrendered to Japanese forces May 6, 1942. He was held 
as a prisoner for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Dandrido is now 76. His children have gone to work in Hong Kong. And last 
year, more than half a century after his service at Corregidor, he was given 
U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Dandrido wants to come to the United States. But he said sadly, "I have no 
money."

ISRAELI TOURISTS GET WELCOME IN JORDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In high spirits and with tight security, the first busload of Israeli tourists 
crossed into Jordan on Sunday, hoping to make friends in a land until recently 
considered an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to Jordan. Now we have peace and can visit each other like good 
neighbors. It's a great moment," said Abdullah Jaber, a Jordanian tour guide 
who hopped on the bus at the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35 pioneer Israeli tourists broke into hearty applause. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a dream come true," said Yoram Eden, an accounting professor from 
Herzliya. 
</P>
<P>
 Historic significance overtook bureaucratic procedures at the Jordanian border 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues gathered to watch a Jordanian police officer stamp the Israeli 
passports. "It's the first time, you know," the officer said with a big smile. 
</P>
<P>
 A currency clerk, asked if he could change Israeli shekels for Jordanian 
dinars, answered, "Not yet, but soon." 
</P>
<P>
 The travelers were the first to enter Jordan with Israeli passports since the 
two neighbors signed a peace treaty Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli passports, even Israeli visa stamps in foreign passports, were banned 
in the past. After a nonbelligerency treaty was signed in July, Jordan opened 
its borders only to Israelis carrying foreign passports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to see the first Israelis. I want to tell them that we are very 
excited about peace," said Mohammed Kalifa, a mechanical engineer in his 50s 
who came all the way from Amman, 175 miles to the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pleasure," border police commander Lt. Col. Abdul Rahman said as he 
shook hands with the arriving Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the two-day tour is the ancient city of Petra, the rose-red 
capital of the Nabateans that dates back more than 2,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Israelis, Petra symbolized the Jewish state's isolation from the rest 
of the region. Dozens of Israeli youths tried to sneak across the desert border 
to Petra as a test of courage. A Hebrew song, "The Red Rock," glorified one 
officer's secret journey and was banned from state radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the friendliness, a three-car police escort pulled behind the bus as 
it headed for Petra, and at least three soldiers or police officers were 
positioned at every intersection along the route. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli tourists were warned not to speak Hebrew in loud voices or wear 
T-shirts with Hebrew slogans while in Jordan, where Islamic militants strongly 
oppose the peace agreement with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many in the group broke out singing "The Red Rock" as the bus pulled into 
Petra on Sunday evening, after a several-hour journey that included a feast 
over lamb at a Bedouin encampment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour leader Moshe Hananel said he brought only 35 people for the first trip, 
which returns today. He plans to bring 250 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect much of the Jordanians. I certainly hope they don't disappoint us," 
said Yitzhak Chesler, a tour guide from Herzliya, as he waited for his passport 
to be processed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have so much to gain in economy from the peace that I expect openness, 
and I hope I'll find friendship."

SHUTTLE SET TO RETURN; EDWARDS IS LIKELY LANDING SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The space shuttle Atlantis' six astronauts wrapped up their work in orbit 
Sunday as scientists gloated over the amount of data collected during the 
11-day mission to map ozone in Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 One ozone monitor aboard Atlantis gathered enough data to fill 120,000 
computer floppy disks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some science teams here that are quite well-fed," said NASA mission 
scientist Tim Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle's scheduled landing this morning at the Kennedy Space Center was 
threatened by Tropical Storm Gordon. NASA sent the astronauts' families to 
California on Sunday to await a probable landing there. The astronaut corps' 
chief, Robert Cabana, also headed west to supervise the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other space shuttles have been diverted to the desert runways at Edwards 
Air Force Base in the past two months because of storms. Atlantis' first 
landing opportunity was about 7:30 a.m. EST at the space center. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one word, the forecast . . . is lousy," said flight director Jeff Bantle. 
"There are going to be low clouds. There's going to be rain. There's going to 
be gale-force wind." 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook for Tuesday is just as bad. Good weather was forecast for Edwards; 
Bantle said the shuttle could land there later this morning if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of a California landing, shuttle commander Donald McMonagle 
played a recording of the theme from the old TV show "Route 66" for Mission 
Control late Sunday. This is the 66th space shuttle mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the '56 T-Bird convertible parked outside. When we get off watch, I'm 
going to try to make it (to California)," Mission Control's Mario Runco joked.

 Atlantis had enough power to stay in orbit until Tuesday -- possibly Wednesday 
if extreme conservation measures were taken, said mission operations director 
Lee Briscoe.

<P>
 It costs about $1 million to transport a shuttle back to the space center atop 
a modified Boeing 747 jumbo jet. NASA also loses a week in getting the shuttle 
ready for its next flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantis isn't scheduled to fly again until late May or early June, but that 
is to be 1995's biggest mission, the first shuttle docking with Russia's space 
station, Mir. NASA must install a docking mechanism on Atlantis as soon as it 
returns to the space center. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm that threatened to divert the shuttle to California toppled tents 
Sunday at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but did little damage. 
</P>
<P>
 No serious injuries were reported among the 23,000 Cuban and 6,000 Haitian 
refugees at Guantanamo. 
</P>
<P>
 Two military personnel received minor injuries when tents fell, a base 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon packed sustained winds of up to 45 m.p.h. and torrential rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind gusts up to 120 m.p.h. whipped Cuba a day after the storm soaked Jamaica.

<P>
 Gale warnings were posted for the east coast of Florida from St. Augustine to 
the Dry Tortugas.

STUNNING BLOW FOR A HIRED GUN 
</P>

<P>
 The rumors started last summer, just a few months after Clint Reilly took over 
Kathleen Brown's gubernatorial campaign. Soon, the talk was so prevalent that 
some people suspected that Reilly, a San Francisco-based political consultant, 
had started it himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knew that Reilly was a close friend of Tony Coelho, the ex-California 
congressman whom President Clinton had named chief strategist to the Democratic 
National Committee. Some speculated that with Coelho's help, Reilly -- who 
helped elect the current mayors of Los Angeles and San Francisco -- could be 
positioning himself to manage Clinton's reelection effort. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one caveat: Before Reilly could burst onto the national stage, he 
would have to lead Brown to victory over Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Brown's crushing defeat, the talk swirling around the 
controversial Reilly could not be more different from the scuttlebutt of months 
past. Especially since a week or so ago, when a Clinton Administration official 
told reporters that "Reilly should be tried for political malpractice," the 
mercurial consultant's future has been widely debated among political insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurring the criticism was Reilly's admission that he had to pull Brown's TV 
commercials off the air the last weekend before the election because the 
campaign was out of money. Many consultants found this appalling because the 
Brown campaign had raised $24 million -- more than any other Democratic 
campaign ever in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, even campaigns with far less money had managed to save their 
firepower for the final weeks, when more voters were paying attention. By 
canceling its ad time, some say, the Brown campaign sent a signal that it was 
conceding defeat, thus allowing Wilson to divert more than $500,000 from his 
own effort to help Republican candidates for other positions get elected. 
</P>
<P>
 "This cost us probably the (state) Assembly, probably two down-ballot seats, 
and we pulled two others out by the skin of our teeth," said a political 
consultant who was involved in the campaign of another Democrat on the 1994 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Clint Reilly were a real estate agent and handled a client's money the way 
he handled the resources of this campaign, he would be sued and convicted for 
criminal malfeasance," said this consultant, who charged that Reilly had spent 
too much during the summer months, failing to save money for the end. The 
consultant noted that Reilly made a commission on every TV ad that was 
produced, so he had an incentive to produce a lot of them. 
</P>
<P>
 A Republican consultant echoed this view, saying Brown's money troubles -- 
combined with the revelation that before Reilly signed on with Brown, he had 
discussed possible roles in the campaigns of Wilson and U.S. Rep. Mike 
Huffington -- will "hurt Reilly with the Democratic Party." 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had won, they might have overlooked it," this consultant said. "But 
given how much money the campaign spent, and given that it ran out of money at 
the end, I think that will doom him from getting any major Democrats" in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly said that the criticism does not surprise him, but that it is 
misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get the credit when they win and I deserve a fair measure of the blame when 
they lose. . . . (But) in hindsight all things are clear," he said. He asserted 
that if Brown had aired ads during the last weekend, it would not have changed 
the outcome. And he said if she had not spent money during the summer months, 
she would have been even farther behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the primary, we were down by a sizable margin," he said. "And I think 
we correctly assessed that if we went passively through the summer we probably 
would have been behind 20 points. We would have been in an irretrievable 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly declined to talk about how much money his firm made on the Brown 
campaign or on what Brown's loss would mean for his future. 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, who ran Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's campaign against 
Brown in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, said campaigns are far too big 
and complicated to be blamed on any one person. While he said political 
consultants' "rule No. 1 is you don't run out of money before you run out of 
campaign," he maintained that anyone who predicts Reilly's professional demise 
is a fool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was answering these same questions the day after Clint Reilly fired Dianne 
Feinstein in public," said Sragow, who worked for Feinstein's gubernatorial 
campaign in 1989 when Reilly -- then Feinstein's campaign manager -- sent out a 
fax announcing that he was quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was saying any consultant who did what he did then is ejected, is 
out of here, is not running any campaign on the planet Earth. And he went on to 
work for Kathleen Brown. . . . He's been written off many times before. He's by 
no means dead."

SEEKING SOULS OF O.C. KOREAN AMERICANS; RELIGION: PIONEERING PASTOR OFFERS THE 
YOUNG AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITION

<P>
 The church is borrowed, the hymnals donated and the preacher subsidized by 
worried East Coast and South Korean congregations that are praying vigorously 
for the far-flung missionary outpost in suburban Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Just four months ago, the makeshift mission of Newsong Community Church in 
Irvine was little more than their common prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Rev. David Gibbons, 32, of Ellicott, Md., a missionary more 
comfortable in stone-washed denim than clerical collar, the son of a U.S. 
veteran and a Korean woman. Navigating a rented truck, he rumbled 3,000 miles 
west to Southern California in search of what he termed the "Silent Exodus": 
young, second-generation Asians who are drifting away from traditional 
immigrant churches. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck came to a halt in Irvine, where Gibson surveyed the flat landscape 
of sparkling shopping strips and noodle restaurants, the bustling UC Irvine 
campus and neighborhoods where the Asian population has been boosted by a 
steady migration of Korean immigrants in the aftermath of the Los Angeles 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Fertile territory, the missionary concluded, for a rich harvest of souls. The 
perfect place to launch a contemporary church catering to young, 
English-speaking Korean Americans, who have been slipping out of the church 
pews in rates as high as 60%, according to some surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Gibbons, who resigned his ministry in Maryland to move to 
California, couldn't even afford to rent a pew. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have enough to start a building," recalled Gibbons, who held the 
original prayer meetings for Newsong in his cramped living room. "I was having 
second thoughts. We have three children with another on the way." 
</P>
<P>
 But he took comfort from his strategic master plan: "Our vision is to start a 
church-planting movement. Presently, we have selected Orange County, 
California, as the site of this hub church because of its close proximity to 
Los Angeles and its Asian American harvest that seems ripe for the Gospel 
message." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing this eight-page plan, Gibbons set about appealing for financial and 
spiritual help from mega-churches as distant as Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need a mother church, a Korean church," said Yong Jo Hah, the senior 
pastor at the 10,000-member Onnuri Church in Seoul, which is one of the largest 
congregations in the world. "The first generation is good because they use the 
mother tongue. But the second generation knows the United States. And they 
don't know the Korean church. So we must give some help." 
</P>
<P>
 And they did; Onnuri Church sent Gibbons a plane ticket to visit their 
congregation and then pledged $3,600 toward the opening of his church. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons also sought support from Bethel Presbyterian Korean Church in 
Maryland, where he previously presided over the English-speaking ministry for 
the affluent, suburban congregation. Church members started praying and 
collecting monthly donations of $2,000 to subsidize the work of Gibbons, whom 
they label simply "our California missionary." 
</P>
<P>
 And he turned to the sprawling South Coast Community Church, a 
nondenominational congregation in Irvine that regularly attracts thousands to 
its Sunday services at Bonita Canyon Road but had failed to draw the growing 
Asian population. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had this nagging low-grade stress over the question of how we could best 
serve the needs of the Asians around us," said Bob Shank, the senior pastor, 
who every Sunday noticed how few Asians were at his church services. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast didn't have money to offer Gibbons, but instead they gave much 
more: a meeting room, office equipment, child care services, moral support. The 
results were swift. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Newsong hosted its first service in a spacious meeting room 
with a baby grand piano, tropical plants and almost 100 worshipers -- 
two-thirds of them young Asian adults. 
</P>
<P>
 For the opening service, Gibbons shed his denims for a dark suit and tie. He 
faced the new church members with hands clasped, almost casually delivering a 
sermon that he had practiced nearly 20 hours at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother is the Korean part of my background," he introduced himself. "And 
my father is the Anglo -- he's the one with green eyes. I was always 
embarrassed to hang out with my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 He would distance himself from her in stores when she would haggle with 
bemused salesclerks over prices. And he would hide from her bellowing laugh 
that seemed to fill a shopping mall. He knew well that he was the mirror of his 
mother, yet he didn't consider himself Korean. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of those days -- my mom embarrassing me. But now those memories are 
precious. It was just 10 years ago that she was killed by a drunk driver," 
Gibbons said. "Oh, I wish she could be here in the front row." 
</P>
<P>
 There was silence, a rustling of paper. Deep in the back rows, Insung Kim 
carefully studied the preacher, counting the new members of the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 He had come from Los Angeles at the behest of Young Nak Presbyterian church, 
one of the largest Korean congregations in Southern California. Kim was 
gathering research for a strategy report to prevent the drift of younger 
generations from Korean churches. 
</P>
<P>
 After visiting more than 20 churches, he was keenly aware of the forces 
driving the young away. Groups such as the Christian Korean American Alliance 
have conducted surveys showing that the majority of English-speaking Koreans in 
their 20s and 30s drop out because they cannot understand Korean well enough to 
fathom a sermon. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent, egalitarian values of the U.S.-educated generation are often 
strikingly at odds with the patriarchal views of an older generation raised on 
a Confucian philosophy prizing respect for age and authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Within Newsong, Gibbons had tried purposely to make his church hierarchy less 
rigid, sharing power with his staff volunteers. He chooses to be called Dave 
instead of reverend. He almost apologized for asking visitors to sign 
membership cards, telling his infant flock that across the form they could 
scrawl, "I don't want to be bothered." 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, Gibbons said, members of traditional churches suffer "burn-out" 
because they become preoccupied with activities and rigid rules governing dos 
and don'ts. Gibbons, raised in a strict Baptist church, was a victim of it 
himself; he recalls when his small liberal arts college barred him from dating 
white female students. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons also theorizes that the younger generation is turned off by churches 
that don't reflect the diversity of the wider population and its culture -- 
including contemporary music. For years, Newsong church member Nicole Lou, 30, 
of Irvine had been looking for just such religious refuge. The child of 
Taiwanese immigrants, Lou tried participating in a Chinese church, but found it 
intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went once," she said. "It scared me. You have to remember that even though 
I'm Chinese, I've been around Anglos all my life. It was a culture shock, the 
fact that they only spoke Chinese. I felt very uncomfortable. There was a 
generation gap as well and it was very traditional and rigid." 
</P>
<P>
 She grew up in West Africa and moved to the United States in 1976. Very few of 
her friends were Asians so she used to consider it a compliment when people 
would say they didn't think of her as Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been raised around people who weren't like me all my life," she said. 
"I'm looking to be around people who are more like me. Newsong is a nice 
variety. Most are Koreans and there are a few Chinese and Vietnamese. What I 
really like about this church is that it allows people from all different 
races." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine optometrist Miran Kim so liked the concept of Newsong Church that she 
also moved from Maryland, where she was attending Gibbons' church, to launch 
the Irvine congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be in an environment where those people who are searching can 
come freely and be encouraged to be who they are," Kim said. "And also, Asian 
Americans are often very success-oriented. And they need a place where they can 
realize that is very short-lived and then can find the purpose in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the couples who have joined Newsong have mixed ethnic backgrounds and 
were searching for a place where their children could fit in. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife is Korean and I'm a regular white guy," said Mark McIntosh, a Costa 
Mesa illustrator. "We wanted to be in a situation where our 2-year-old son 
would be exposed to both cultures." 
</P>
<P>
 What they found appealing about this church was its low-key philosophy and the 
personal relationships formed in a small setting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Helen, helped design Newsong's logo, a spare design showing a 
dazzling sun shining over a church with a broad open door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes with what the church is about," he said. "Really pretty simple, not 
intimidating . . . not corporate at all."

O.C. STUDENTS IN A LAWSUIT STATE OF MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One day he was practicing for a big football game. The next Michael Carter was 
tackling the legal system, eventually claiming in a lawsuit he was wrongly 
kicked out of his all-boy Catholic high school for accusing female teachers of 
"femi-Nazi tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter says it's a matter of free speech. Since he sued Servite High School in 
Anaheim, the Huntington Beach teen-ager has made headlines and received support 
from Rush Limbaugh, the talk show host who coined the phrase Carter says got 
him in trouble during a school campaign speech. People now stop Carter for 
autographs and he has coined a message of his own: 
</P>
<P>
 "Question everything," he tells them. "Don't be afraid to speak out." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, whose case is nearing trial in Orange County Superior Court, is part 
of a recent wave of students who are not just speaking out at school -- they 
are hiring lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 While attorneys, school and court officials don't keep statistics on such 
lawsuits, many say they believe the number of local cases against schools are 
rising, from disputes over schoolyard injuries and special education services 
to complaints that school administrators are trampling basic freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, a Mission Viejo teen-ager went to court claiming a teacher 
violated his constitutional liberties by disciplining him for wearing a devil 
mascot logo on his letter jacket. Another South County boy called a news 
conference to allege he was assaulted by a teacher who thought he had been 
hiding dice. And in another case, a former Newport Harbor High School student 
sued over what she considered the outrageous and illegal fees of joining her 
school's cheerleading squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, people would ask me, 'What do schools need an attorney for?' " 
said attorney Geraldine Jaffe, of the Orange County Department of Education. 
"Nobody has asked me that in years." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe attributes the apparent rise to the notion that "school districts are 
truly microcosms of what's going on in society." 
</P>
<P>
 Students, their parents and their lawyers have other ideas, talking of 
arrogance and stubborn attitudes on the part of administrators and supportive 
Baby Boomer parents who fought for their own rights as students in the 1960s 
and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Strict zero-tolerance disciplinary policies involving weapons, alcohol and 
drugs, along with changing state and federal law involving special education, 
also are contributing to litigation, lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the causes, the cases and legal threats are taking a toll from 
schools, especially administrators who are "getting yelled at from every 
corner," said David Larsen, an Orange County attorney who often represents 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot more demands are being placed on people that are time consuming and 
diverting attention away from the basic education programs they are trying to 
provide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of civil and criminal action, as well as the potential of losing 
their credentials and jobs, is putting teachers in "quadruple jeopardy," said 
Tommye Hutto, with the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a chilling effect," Hutto said. "Teachers are more cautious and less 
willing to take risks with students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not good for teachers at all," she added. "It's not good for students 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say that mistakes can happen and some claims are legitimate, 
but contend that most of the disputes could be resolved short of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The concerns are just as real for private schools, which have fewer resources 
to defend themselves in court than larger public districts, said Father Gerald 
Horan, president of Servite High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's unfortunate that any time a person doesn't get their way, the 
first thing they threaten to do is sue," Horan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could hear and appreciate another person's perspective, if we could 
respect the fact that another person feels differently, we could make so much 
more headway. The minute you threaten to sue, you're in a standoff." 
</P>
<P>
 Students involved in some local cases say their decision to sue was not made 
lightly, and they too suffer a heavy price for fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the last resort," said Heather Delaney, the 17-year-old former 
cheerleader who is suing Newport-Mesa Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Delaney alleges she was illegally charged more than $1,700 
in one year for her uniforms, coaches and other expenses, fees that boys don't 
have to pay in their athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Delaney said she has lost friends since making her allegations and felt so 
"unwelcome" at her school that she transferred to another for her senior year. 
She fought back tears as she talked about what's happened to her final year of 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying to focus not on what I'm missing, but what I will be 
accomplishing," Delaney said during as recent interview in her family's living 
room, her attorney seated at her side. "My goal is that the district will 
become more sensitive and cheerleading will be more fair and equitable for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer, John S. Roth, declined to discuss the family's arrangement for 
paying for his services. Delaney said her parents are backing her up "100%" in 
her lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents are just glad I'm having the courage to do this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing the school district could not be reached for comment 
before press time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, school officials have said they did nothing wrong, and said they 
tried to work with the Delaney family for six to eight months, enlisting a 
district committee to review the complaints through an internal hearing 
process, in the hopes of resolving the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Delaney's allegations recall another much-publicized lawsuit brought in 1990 
by a former Irvine cheerleader, Melissa Fontes, who alleged that girls on her 
Woodbridge High School pep squad were held to a higher academic standard than 
the male athletes they cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontes sued to have the policy changed -- but did not seek any damages from 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 A state appellate court agreed with her, overturning a 1992 Orange County 
Superior Court decision that had gone against Fontes. The state Supreme Court 
eventually allowed the appellate ruling to stand, but ruled that the decision 
should not set a legal precedent for other cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Bonnie K. Lawley is still trying to make the district pay $37,000 in 
attorney fees, which she says is just a fraction of the actual cost. 
</P>
<P>
 She did not charge the Fonteses, but the family paid close to $5,000 in basic 
court costs that come with filing motions and other actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontes, now 21 and a philosophy major at an Oregon college, said the 
experience ruined her memories of high school, although she doesn't regret 
going to court. She's considering going to law school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the most significant learning experiences I've had," she said. 
"It really tested my principles and my integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawley said she was so committed to the Fontes case because she had faced a 
similar problem with her own daughter's middle school cheerleading program. But 
in her daughter's case, Lawley said, the school changed its policy without a 
court fight, something she wishes others would do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see educators develop more open minds in terms of looking at the 
requirements they set and how they affect young people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia Carter, whose son Michael is fighting to be readmitted to Servite High 
School, said the decision to sue the Catholic school was a difficult one, and 
one made possible only through an offer of free help from an attorney with the 
Los Angeles-based Individual Rights Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious, painful situation," Cecilia Carter said during a recent 
interview at her family's Catholic supplies shop in Newport Beach. "But above 
everything else, it's a First Amendment issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney John Howard, who is representing Michael Carter, said he believes 
many students and their parents find themselves faced with a "profound 
arrogance" on the part of school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good that kids are finding out that they have rights," Howard said. 
"It's probably a better civics lesson than anything they can get in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, 18, filed his lawsuit last fall, contending that administrators 
ordered him to undergo psychological counseling after he made the "femi-Nazi" 
reference during a campaign speech toward the end of the previous school year. 
When he refused to comply with the order, contending it was improper 
discipline, school officials denied his readmission. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite officials say the Carters and their attorney have misrepresented what 
happened, and that Carter was not asked to attend counseling because of the 
"femi-Nazi" reference. They contend the statement reflected a pattern of 
behavior teachers found "offensive and disrespectful." 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly we did not punish him for what he said in his speech," Servite 
President Horan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said the lawsuit has made his studies difficult, recalling one night 
that he was up until 2 a.m. trying to get written verification from his former 
classmates about the contents of his campaign speech. The next morning he had 
to take a college-entrance exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really has affected my studies in a big way," said Carter, who spent his 
senior year at a public high school. "I really couldn't focus. It was always in 
the back of my head, kicking at me." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter has graduated from high school and is now working at his family's store 
and helping out as an assistant to a priest. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is continuing to seek readmission to Servite to vindicate his name, 
and to improve his chance of getting into a Catholic college. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge has denied one request that Carter be readmitted. A jury trial is set 
for February. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cases have come in response to newly stringent discipline policies at 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine attorney Jack A. Fleischli said he has handled three cases involving 
students who faced possible expulsion for a single violation after having 
previously unblemished records. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited an Anaheim Hills honor student who was forced to transfer to another 
high school last year after distributing a controversial underground newspaper. 
School officials said the paper made "obscene" and "defamatory" remarks about 
school employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The student sued, but later dropped the case after settling for a voluntary 
transfer to a school that offered the college-bound academic programs he 
needed, Fleischli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleischli said he believes "zero-tolerance" policies that mandate expulsions 
for various offenses are a "knee-jerk reaction to complex problems" that have 
increased risk of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the 'three strikes' law," he said, referring to California's new 
law requiring life prison terms for three-time felons. "It's an easy rule to 
make and apply, but it's not great when you start applying it to individuals 
who do not seem to deserve the consequences they received." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleischli said he has noticed a common thread among student clients. "The kids 
are all fighters," he said. "They won't give up. They're aggressive in their 
attitude and they have a strong self-image. Their parents are not the kind who 
will simply bow away from a confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
 While Orange County educators and lawyers cite an increase in school lawsuits, 
that may not be the case elsewhere in the country. Perry A. Zirkel, a professor 
of education and law at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, said his research 
shows a nationwide decrease in the rate of most state and federal education 
cases being filed. He said that more cases nationwide are being won by school 
districts, reversing trends of the 1960s and 1970s when student lawsuits 
sparked several landmark U.S. Supreme Court rulings establishing student rights 
approaching those of adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Zirkel, however, said he has noted two areas -- special education and disputes 
over religion -- where the number of cases are consistently increasing 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, school officials and their lawyers have stepped up efforts to head 
off disputes before they land in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1982, preventive law has become a major service of the Orange County 
Department of Education, where staff attorneys offer advice, issue legal 
opinions and hold workshops to help educators avoid problems and resolve 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment, child welfare, dress codes and search and seizure of 
student property were the topics of some recent workshops, said attorney Jaffe, 
a member of the department's schools legal services office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our office is busier than ever," said Ron Wenkart, general counsel for the 
education department. 
</P>
<P>
 Wenkart said most disputes are settled without ever going to court and 
administrators are eager to make changes necessary to avoid problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made changes," he said. "We have resolved these issues. You only read 
about the ones that don't get resolved."

FROM ASHES, A DANCE OF LIFE; FOR FIRE VICTIMS, THE STEPS TO HEALING ARE MENTAL 
AND PHYSICAL 
</P>

<P>
 They call themselves the "fire tribe," this group of 11 women whose bonds were 
forged in the grief, rage and renewal they have experienced since their homes 
were lost to the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned by their own reactions to the destruction of their houses and all 
their belongings in the October, 1993 firestorm, the women were among numerous 
Laguna residents who sought help from psychologists and counselors in the first 
weeks after the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike most other support and therapy groups that sprang up here in the 
wake of the fire, this one continued throughout the year, disbanding officially 
-- and emotionally -- only last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Its members say they found the group a "space to heal," as one put it, a haven 
in which to explore and compare feelings about their loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had I not been in this group, I would have buried a lot of feelings and maybe 
never have really recovered," Dorothy Thurman, a graphic designer, said during 
their final session. 
</P>
<P>
 As they recovered, the group members taught therapists Ellen McGrath and Karen 
Bohan about the value of innovative treatment strategies that could have 
far-reaching implications for victims of other kinds of trauma, McGrath and 
Bohan say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned so much from this experience, we really feel like we gained more 
than we gave," said McGrath, a clinical psychologist who, like Bohan, donated 
her time to lead this therapy group and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the lessons they learned, McGrath said, was the value of group rather 
than individual therapy for trauma victims, and how techniques often used for 
treating depression were also helpful in the treatment of trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what really blew us away," said McGrath, who is nationally recognized 
for her research on women and depression. "In some cases, these strategies were 
even more effective in quickly resolving trauma than in dealing with 
depression." 
</P>
<P>
 The therapists, both of whom had previously worked with trauma victims, said 
they realized even more clearly than before how vital it was for those who have 
suffered a loss or other emotional shock to progress through four steps toward 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The steps include the initial phase of emotional -- and, in some cases, 
physical -- shutdown; the "feelings" stage, where emotions about the trauma 
trickle and eventually flood in; the "action" phase, where physical activity, 
including anger release, are important, and the "integration" stage, in which 
the recovering clients are able to use the knowledge they have gained. 
</P>
<P>
 At their final meeting in the rented Laguna home of two members, the women sat 
comfortably on sofas, their trust and affection for each other evident from the 
outset. The group's members, most of them professionals, ranged in age from 
mid-20s to mid-60s and include former homeowners and former renters.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is no age difference here," said Joye Fromong, a 64-year-old retired 
school counselor, gazing fondly at those gathered about her. "There is no 
economic difference here. It never mattered whether people lost a home or an 
apartment; the fire was simply a thing that happened to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 But many of their early meetings were so intense and emotional that one 
member, choreographer Gaila Lebherz, dropped out after one session, overwhelmed 
by the heart-rending stories she heard. One month later, unable to sleep or to 
stop crying, she returned at the urging of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "That time, it felt better to me . . . and I immediately bonded with all these 
other women," said Lebherz, 43. "This was a group of people who were not afraid 
to share their deep feelings, who weren't in denial. It was a great relief to 
go in there and be real." 
</P>
<P>
 The group members quickly discovered that they shared such stress-related 
symptoms as waking up at 3 a.m., often for months after the fire. They found 
relief and laughter in their shared feelings of irritation at the well-meaning 
but often awkward efforts of many people to help them. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the fire, for instance, residents of Laguna and other nearby 
communities tried to help their stricken neighbors by donating thousands of 
pounds of used clothes and shoes. But some of the clothing was torn or stained, 
leaving the recipients struggling with feelings of resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You were supposed to be grateful, but instead you felt resentful and then so 
awful about feeling that way," Lebherz said. "But everybody in the group would 
jump up and say, 'Yes!' whenever you said something like that. It really helped 
us let go of the guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 They also pushed each other to recover, providing support even as they refused 
to allow one another to deny their continuing feelings of grief or anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it seemed like each meeting took me back to the terrible despairing 
place I'd been right after the fire, but it was all right," writer Bobbie 
Chalmers said. "For my own protection, I'd grown a scab and then I'd come here 
each week and it would be picked at. But it helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, along with the talking, McGrath and Bohan began to use a variety of 
"action strategies," some of which McGrath had come up with for a 1992 book on 
depression, "When Feeling Bad Is Good." 
</P>
<P>
 "Women often don't tend to take action in these situations," McGrath said. 
"And even if they can't take actions that deal directly with the catastrophe, 
they can start with these strategies as a way to build up energy and start to 
think clearly." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, men are better than women at taking action in the wake of a 
trauma, but often don't talk through their feelings or stay emotionally 
connected to those around them, she said. As a result, many men who lost homes 
in the fire have not yet begun to come to terms with the experience, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the techniques McGrath suggested proved extraordinarily effective for 
the group members, including journal-writing and anger release strategies such 
as ripping old phone books or pounding pillows. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many, the single most therapeutic technique was an experiment in dance 
therapy, led by Lebherz, who choreographed a dance about her own fire 
experience and then taught it to the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The dance, in which some performers play the role of victims and the others 
the fire, had a powerful impact, releasing still-buried feelings of fear and 
anger, the group members said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also has inspired Lebherz to return to school. At McGrath's suggestion, she 
auditioned for UCLA's dance therapy program, was accepted and received a full 
scholarship to pursue a master's degree in the innovative therapy, which she 
hopes to use to help other trauma victims. 
</P>
<P>
 After 20 years of teaching modern dance, "this is just kind of stunning for 
me," Lebherz said last week. "I've always been involved in dance as a 
performing art, but this has expanded my whole perspective to the way it can be 
used as a healing art." 
</P>
<P>
 Others also pursued creative outlets. Chalmers, a free-lance writer, found 
that the fire and its aftermath released a flood of emotions and creativity. 
Over the months, she has written many poems about the fire and shared them with 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Several, including Fromong, began keeping journals, writing movingly of their 
feelings of frustration, anger and grief about the fire. Fromong said the 
journal also helped her to make it through another stressful event, a recent 
visit to her terminally ill mother in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of focusing solely on her mother's situation and her own fears about 
impending death, Fromong said, the journal helped to lift her out of her grief. 
"It was a matter of focusing, bringing a little reality in instead of dwelling 
in the land of grief," Fromong said. "I felt so strong; I would never have been 
able to handle it so well before." 
</P>
<P>
 The group members say they will continue to talk and even meet periodically, 
although no longer with McGrath and Bohan. And they say they hope their 
experience, and the strategies that worked for them, can be used to help others 
recover from similar traumas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't ever want anyone to have to go through what we went through, but 
the fact is, people will," said JoHanna Sisson, another retired teacher and 
school counselor. "I wish we had a book to put in their hands, a group to put 
them into. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we'd just all like to tell them that they don't have to start at the 
beginning."

RAMS-RAIDERS GAME IS HARD-FOUGHT ON FIELD AND IN STANDS; SPORTS: FOURTEEN FANS 
ARE ARRESTED AND 55 ARE EJECTED AS CAPACITY CROWD LIVES UP TO TRADITIONAL 
UNRULINESS. 
</P>

<P>
 Rams and Raiders fans on Sunday celebrated what could be their last game as 
cross-town rivals in their customary way. 
</P>
<P>
 They drank and fought. 
</P>
<P>
 Police counted at least 26 altercations and arrested 14 people -- mostly for 
drunkenness and fighting -- during a sold-out football game that drew 65,208 
spectators and was watched as closely for the battling in the stands as on the 
field. Besides those arrested, 55 fans were ejected for general misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw men just beating on each other rapid fire. I've been to several hockey 
games in St. Louis but never seen crowd fights like at the game today," said 
Rob Harvath, a visiting retail analyst for Anheuser-Busch who watched the game 
-- and the fights -- from the beer company's luxury box. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence, in which no one was seriously injured, might have been worse but 
for the scores of extra police and Anaheim Stadium security personnel placed on 
duty after the last brawl-marred meeting between the teams, a preseason game in 
August during which more than 20 were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, at least, the fighting waited until the start of the game, which 
the Raiders won 20-17. In August, police reported people were going at it 
during the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The third quarter started turning kind of south," said Sgt. Gerald Stec, who 
heads the Anaheim police stadium detail. By the fourth quarter, officials had 
turned off the beer spigots to an upper-deck section where as many as two dozen 
people were involved in the afternoon's biggest brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 A clash erupted near the end zone among fans who seemed oblivious to the fact 
that it was a crucial point late in the game and the Rams were about to score 
right in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Stec said the added police presence -- groups of a dozen or more uniformed 
officers were posted near end-zone trouble spots -- helped prevent other large 
fights and kept the mayhem to a minimum. He said police were able to stamp out 
most of the skirmishes quickly and without serious injury to fans. 
</P>
<P>
 First-aid workers reported four to five fight-related injuries, but only one 
of those people was taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a season ticket-holder and I'm disgusted by it," said Rams fan Ed Stevens 
of Costa Mesa, who left the game early with his 11-year-old son after watching 
brawls break out in the stands. "It's notorious -- every time the Rams and 
Raiders get together." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens blamed drinking for the trouble. "I don't think they should serve beer 
when these two teams get together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the cap vendors were steering clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Concessionaire Mike Winn tended a stand high up in the stadium's top level -- 
far away, he hoped, from the kind of scrapping he saw during the August game. 
"There must have been 30 fights," Winn recalled. "I said, put me someplace 
where I can't get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 The brawling Sunday may have marred history in the making. In view of 
speculation that the Rams may move after this season to St. Louis or Baltimore 
and rumors that the Raiders too may end up elsewhere, it is possible that 
Sunday's game was the last between the Rams and Raiders as local teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's talking about that. Keep your tickets -- they might be 
collectibles someday," said longtime Rams season ticket-holder Raymond Steed, a 
Downey iron worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Garcia, whose face was painted in Rams blue and gold, flew from 
Albuquerque, N.M., for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams may be leaving soon. This is (for) bragging rights for L.A. before 
the Rams leave," said Garcia, who said he was involved in a pregame scuffle in 
the parking lot after a Raiders fan tried to snare his friend's Rams banner. 
"It got a little bit rowdy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steed played down the rivalry between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it all boils down to is, this is just a game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just L.A. It's just the L.A. get-together," said Steed. "There's enough 
violence here. We don't need any more."

FAMILIES MUST GAZE ACROSS GREAT DIVIDE OF PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: IN SOME 
CASES, PARENTS ARE HERE LEGALLY, THEIR CHILDREN ARE NOT. SIBLINGS TOO ARE 
SPLIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Jose Garcia Molina is a legal U.S. resident who has held a steady job with the 
same Orange County company for nine years. His 8-year-old son and 3-year-old 
daughter were born here -- and are citizens in a country that they love. 
</P>
<P>
 But his is a family divided. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina applied to legalize his undocumented wife and 10-year-old daughter two 
years ago under a federal family unification program, but the process is slow. 
His family, and thousands of others like them across Orange County, remain 
split -- straddling legality, ridden with anxiety, and subject to a sweeping 
new law whose course no one can predict. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very happy with my family here," said Molina, who came to the city of 
Orange in 1979 and works as a busboy at a local restaurant. "It would be very 
different to have some of us here and some (in Mexico). It will destroy 
families to separate them." 
</P>
<P>
 When voters swept Proposition 187 into law by a landslide Tuesday, they may 
not have had the Molinas in mind as their target. But according to immigration 
consultants and attorneys who have been swamped with questions from anxious 
callers in recent days, Molina's situation is far from unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very, very common problem here," said Michele Garcia-Jurado, a Santa 
Ana immigration consultant. "Several family members are not here legally and 
others are. There are families where the mother and father are legal and the 
children are in the process of being legalized. They're undocumented until the 
moment when they have a visa in their hands." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative denies public education, non-emergency health care and social 
services to illegal immigrants. It also requires those service providers to 
report suspected illegal immigrants to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. A San Francisco County Superior Court judge has temporarily barred 
enforcement of the educational provision and more than half a dozen lawsuits 
have been filed challenging the measure since Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia-Jurado said the split families are particularly concerned about a 
provision of the law that could keep their undocumented children out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so absolutely unfair if a child's papers are in the works and the rest 
of his family is here legally, that he should be thrown out of school," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina's daughter, a shy girl who turned 10 Thursday, said she got worried 
about her situation when she heard four schoolmates talking about the law, but 
her parents have assured her everything will be all right. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Molinas said they wanted to share their story to call attention to the 
inequities of the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 At the family's neat Orange apartment, the television is constantly tuned to 
Spanish-language news. Jose Molina and his wife, Eva, have talked in hushed 
tones about what might happen if the provisions of the law are enforced before 
the family can secure visas for Eva Molina and their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden emphasis on the status that sets her apart from her little brother 
and sister is not lost on their 10-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter said, 'Mom, I'm not going to be able to go to school. I'm going 
to have to stay home with you,' " said Eva Molina, 35, who worries what might 
happen the next time she takes her daughter -- who has asthma -- for a medical 
checkup. "How are we going to move forward with our lives now? We can't keep 
the children studying in the home here like prisoners." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure's co-author, former Immigration and Naturalization Service Western 
Regional Commissioner Harold W. Ezell, said the split families are a delicate 
issue. But he said it is time for families to face the consequences of the 
action they took when they entered the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you put a face on illegal immigration, there are a lot of difficult 
decisions that will have to be made, and I think that's a family decision," 
said Ezell, who suggested that families may have to decide to return to their 
home country together if some children are legal and some are not.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you made a decision to break the law and come here, some day you've got 
to pay. Perhaps the consequences are some of the ones that they're facing now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell said the measure's creators did not consider those details. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't recall us ever sitting and discussing the nuances of each one of 
these issues, because I don't think that we're qualified, or that we should be 
charged with the responsibility to sort out all of the immigration issues, 
humanitarian or whatever it might be," he said. "It's all part of what I think 
the attorney general is going to have to do when he goes to the U.S. Supreme 
Court and puts on the case for California." 
</P>
<P>
 A 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Plyler vs. Doe, granted illegal immigrants 
the right to a free public education. Opponents and backers of Proposition 187 
are convinced their battle ultimately will be fought in front of the high 
court. Critics of the measure say it is unconstitutional, while supporters 
predict the Supreme Court will overturn the Plyler vs. Doe decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the new law treats immigrants in black and white terms -- as 
either legal or illegal -- while the nuances of their status often are far more 
complex. They contend that the measure's authors showed blatant disregard for 
families such as the Molinas. "Looking at the provisions and how the law is 
worded, splitting families, or forcing mixed households to make hard decisions, 
was precisely their purpose," said Susan Alva, an attorney with the Coalition 
for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe nobody thought about the specifics of this law," said Jose Molina, 38. 
"Some people say, 'Yes, I voted for 187,' because they thought that the 
majority of people come here to get on welfare, but that's not true. For me, 
the majority of us came to work. I've never asked for (welfare) assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 If allowed to stand, the blanket approach of Proposition 187 could signal a 
shift away from family unification, long considered the cornerstone of U.S. 
immigration policy, immigration attorneys say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns over dividing families were raised after implementation of the 1986 
Immigration Reform and Control Act, which granted amnesty to people who had 
lived in the country since 1982 and allowed them to become legal residents.  
</P>
<P>
 A so-called family fairness program was implemented in the wake of that act 
that granted permits to undocumented family members of people who had gotten 
amnesty. Then in 1990, a similar program was enacted to assist people who had 
not made the cutoff date for the previous program. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs opened a window for some children and spouses of legal immigrants 
by allowing them to live and work in the United States while awaiting visas. 
</P>
<P>
 But many children and spouses do not qualify under the 1990 program because 
they do not meet requirements that they be continuous residents since 1988 or 
married to their legalized spouse since that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Judit Arevalo's son arrived too late to qualify. Arevalo came to Santa Ana 
from El Salvador in 1979 and is here legally with her husband. But she briefly 
returned to El Salvador -- where her 5-year-old son was born -- and the boy 
only joined his parents in the United States two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This law will affect him. He won't be able to continue studying," Arevalo 
said. "He has memories of El Salvador. He said to me, 'Mommy, if they pass this 
law, I don't want to go back.' "  
</P>
<P>
 For others, the cost of applying to legalize their children has kept them from 
doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Edith Funes and her husband arrived in California in 1985 with farm worker 
visas and spent two seasons picking strawberries and tomatoes in the fields 
near Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Funes, 33, now lives in Santa Ana with four of her five children. She is here 
legally. So are her two U.S.-born children, ages 2 and 7. But the older boys, 
ages 12 and 15, are undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago her husband went back to Mexico, and Funes was diagnosed with 
uterine cancer. Strapped for money and unable to work, she sent a third 
undocumented son, age 17, back to Mexico to live with his grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 Funes said she never had the money to submit the required immigration forms to 
apply to legalize the status of her older children, but with Proposition 187 on 
the ballot, she worried about them constantly. After saving for half a year, 
Funes took $300 last month and put in the application for her two boys. Funes 
said her children will remain undocumented until they receive their visas, 
which could take three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me a long time to save it up all by myself," Funes said. "For me it's 
very hard because I don't have work here. I don't have anything. For the third 
son, I don't have the money now. I just don't have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Her 15-year-old son, a freshman at a Santa Ana high school, said Proposition 
187 has left the boys stranded between the Mexico they left years ago and the 
country where they no longer feel welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to stop going to school and I don't know what's going to 
happen," he said. "My mother would send me back to Mexico, but I don't like it 
over there. I've been raised here since I was 6." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the election, the teen-ager took part in a walkout with hundreds of 
other students to protest Proposition 187. His teachers have been supportive, 
he said, and while most people don't know the details of his situation, he said 
the subject has come up in class. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were talking about it in school, what a family like ours was going to do," 
he said. "It's going to bring a lot of complications for everybody. Instead of 
bringing the community up, it's going to bring everybody down. People will be 
on the street. I think the people who passed it were just thinking about 
themselves."

ATTORNEY COMPETENCE ISSUES MAY SPARE MURDERER; JUSTICE: THE STATE SUPREME COURT 
WILL GET A REPORT THIS WEEK ON THE QUALITY OF THE DEFENSE AT THE 1982 TRIAL OF 
ONE OF ORANGE COUNTY'S MOST VICIOUS KILLERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many residents of California's Death Row, John Louis Visciotti is running 
out of legal challenges to his execution. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old Fullerton man, considered one of Orange County's most vicious 
killers, was convicted in 1982 of murdering one co-worker and shooting a second 
in the eye during a robbery. In an earlier incident, he had knifed another man 
and repeatedly stabbed a pregnant woman who begged for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing Visciotti to death more than a decade ago, Orange County Superior 
Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald told him, "It's my greatest hope, sir, that 
you will actually be executed, and if it would happen soon, I would enjoy 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't happen, and now Visciotti has a chance to escape Death Row. 
Visciotti's lawyers are taking advantage of a common, late-inning approach to 
save his life: they have raised the issue of his trial attorney's competence. 
Ordinarily, death penalty appeals based on incompetent counsel don't succeed, 
but Visciotti has already had some success in mounting this claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court found in March, 1992, that the handling of the case by 
Visciotti's trial lawyer needed to be re-examined by the Orange County Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Orange County Superior Court Judge Eileen C. Moore is expected to 
do that, issuing an assessment for the Supreme Court about the competence of 
his counsel. In that assessment, Moore will be answering a set of questions 
from the justices about the quality of the defense given Visciotti during the 
penalty phase of his trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the Supreme Court will decide whether to order a new trial or a 
new penalty phase. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Visciotti's attorney isn't ordinary. After Visciotti's 
conviction, his attorney, Roger J. Agajanian, served time in prison for 
criminal contempt, was suspended from the State Bar of California three times 
and ultimately was forced to resign from the bar while facing misconduct 
charges stemming from numerous other cases. 
</P>
<P>
 His subsequent history aside, said Deputy Atty. Gen. John Swan, the prosecutor 
in the case, Agajanian gave Visciotti an adequate, if not ideal, defense. Even 
if he didn't, Swan said, "there would have been no different result."  
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Visciotti and a co-worker, Brian Lyle Hefner, had been selling 
portable burglary alarms door-to-door in Garden Grove. When they were fired, 
according to trial testimony, they decided to rob two of their co-workers, who 
had just been paid. They lured Timothy Dykstra and Michael Wolbert to Santiago 
Canyon Road on the pretext of meeting some women.  
</P>
<P>
 After the robbery, when Wolbert refused to get back in the car with the other 
three, Visciotti said, "I panicked. I started shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 He hit Wolbert, then 21, in the eye and Dykstra, 22, in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for 
providing the .22-caliber pistol Visciotti used. 
</P>
<P>
 Visciotti's appeals of his own death sentence to higher courts all failed.  
</P>
<P>
 But then, in its unusual ruling, the state Supreme Court ordered the Orange 
County Superior Court to review the facts of the case. The order questioned 
whether Agajanian, handling his first capital case, had effectively represented 
his client. 
</P>
<P>
 The court was particularly interested in why Agajanian did not tell the jury 
about Visciotti's troubled childhood, including 43 appearances in Juvenile 
Court, or why he appealed to spare Visciotti for his family's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked the jury to spare the defendant because it might hurt his parents," 
said Richard Schwartzberg, one of Visciotti's appeals attorneys. "It was not a 
defense. It's an interesting argument, but it's not a defense."  
</P>
<P>
 The high court also asked whether the fact that Visciotti's family hadn't paid 
Agajanian's full fee influenced his work. (In criminal cases, it is customary 
to pay in advance. According to testimony at the hearing, the family agreed to 
pay Agajanian $25,000. The exact amount he was paid is in dispute. Agajanian 
said it was about $7,000. The family said it was somewhat more, but 
acknowledged it was nowhere near the full amount.) 
</P>
<P>
 In upholding his conviction, the state Supreme Court acknowledged that 
Agajanian's final argument to the jury was "a rambling discourse, not tied to 
particular evidence." But Associate Justice Stanley Mosk's searing dissent 
anticipated the full court's subsequent change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agajanian's deficiencies as trial counsel were pervasive and serious," Mosk 
wrote. "Examples of Agajanian's failings are hard to select, each competing 
with the other for egregiousness." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney's plea to spare Visciotti was "worthless," Mosk wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 At the court-ordered hearing last month before Judge Moore, Agajanian said he 
would conduct his defense the same way if he had it to do over again, attorneys 
for both sides present said. The unpaid fee, he said, was not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Agajanian, who is now living in Boulder, Colo., could not be reached for 
comment.  
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court also voiced concern about Agajanian's professional 
performance not only during but after this case. 
</P>
<P>
 After Visciotti's conviction, Agajanian was convicted of two counts of 
criminal contempt in a federal drug case. In that 1985 incident, he misled a 
judge to avoid having his client appear in court.  
</P>
<P>
 For this conviction, he received the first of several suspensions from the 
California Bar, ultimately resigning his license to practice law while facing 
misconduct charges stemming from other cases.  
</P>
<P>
 He was suspended again in 1990 when he failed to pay his portion of a 
$1.22-million settlement to 80 investors who were bilked out of millions of 
dollars by a man who claimed to be a lawyer and worked in Agajanian's Santa Ana 
office.  
</P>
<P>
 The bar's later charges against Agajanian in the late 1980s included 
mishandling clients' funds, failing to perform services for clients and not 
informing the court that he was suspended from practice, according to the State 
Bar. Agajanian resigned on Dec. 2, 1993, before the charges could be heard.  
</P>
<P>
 "This case is an example of how the State Bar discipline system can 
effectively rid the legal profession of bad apples," said Victoria Molloy, a 
senior attorney with the State Bar, who handled the most recent Agajanian 
charges and his subsequent resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen B. Bright, director of the Atlanta-based Southern Center for Human 
Rights, said, "The right to counsel is not a technicality. It's the most 
fundamental of all constitutional rights." Bright is author of a recent article 
in the Yale Law Journal titled, "The Death Sentence: Not for the Worst Crime 
but for the Worst Lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Judge Moore is scheduled to announce her findings based on the 
hearings she has held. The findings will go to the Supreme Court, which will 
probably ask for further written and oral arguments before rendering its 
decision.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; ORDINANCE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS OVER NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaf blowers and air conditioners will be focuses of discussion today as the 
City Council prepares to pass the city's first comprehensive noise ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing council members Evelyn R. Hart and Jean H. Watt want to outlaw gas 
leaf blowers, but outgoing Mayor Clarence J. Turner has said such a law would 
be impossible to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
 Most residents who have spoken to the council on the issue favor tighter noise 
controls, but disagree on the best way to impose them. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulating air conditioners has also proved problematic, because many areas of 
the city have closely quartered homes with minimal side yards, where most air 
conditioners are mounted. 
</P>
<P>
 Because so much of the city's housing stock is 40 or more years old, their air 
conditioners may be noisy due to age or improper maintenance. The new rules 
would allow those air conditioners to remain until the end of the century but 
would require new units to meet lower noise levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Options the council will consider include measuring the noise air conditioners 
generate from outside nearby homes or from inside and outside nearby homes; 
banning side yard mounts for new and replacement air conditioners and requiring 
front yard or roof mounts instead, or limiting allowable hours of use, with a 
suggested shut-off time of 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the law will classify all properties in the city as residential, 
commercial or industrial and assign acceptable noise limits for each. 
</P>
<P>
 Noise-generating activities in commercial or industrial areas would be 
expected to maintain the lower-level standards of residential areas if the 
sounds carry that far. Under the regulations, daytime is 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., 
nighttime is 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Property maintenance is a separately regulated activity, with noisy functions 
limited to 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays and Saturdays and 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would bring together noise regulations that have been scattered 
throughout ordinances governing other matters, such as public nuisances and 
construction permits. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; ZONING CHANGE CLEARS WAY FOR TOWNHOME 
PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a zone change for two parcels on Trask Avenue, 
where a Seal Beach developer is proposing to build more than three dozen 
townhomes. 
</P>
<P>
 In approving the request last week, council members said the project will 
improve the neighborhood and raise property values in an area that has begun to 
deteriorate in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The zone change to high-density residential will pave the way for the Olson 
Co. to build 69 three-bedroom, two-car garage townhomes on 2.7 acres of land 
currently zoned for industrial and medium density residential uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacant farm buildings are on the larger of the two lots -- a 1.98-acre parcel 
-- and a boarded up house is on the adjacent lot, which is less than an acre. 
The structures will be demolished and the two lots combined, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a public hearing in October, the Planning Commission voted unanimously 
to recommend approval of the zone change. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of a nearby property, Ken Houghton, opposed the zone change, saying 
that the proposed project will create traffic problems and would not blend with 
the single-family homes, apartments and businesses in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer is planning to sell the townhomes for about $140,000 each. BERT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; TRUSTEES TO GET RESULTS OF STUDY ON NEW CHIEF

 School board members will learn what residents want in a new superintendent 
Tuesday night when district consultants report on community interviews they 
conducted earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 But a decision on whether to look outside the Irvine Unified School District 
for a new superintendent will wait until Dec. 6, when new trustee Hank Adler 
joins the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the district's deputy superintendents have expressed interest in 
replacing former Supt. David E. Brown, who left earlier this month to become 
superintendent of the Napa Valley Unified School District. Board members have 
said they may decide not to recruit candidates from outside the school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a decision we need to make," said school board member Mary Ellen Hadley. 
"But I'm sure we're not going to be doing that without the new board member 
taking part." 
</P>
<P>
 The school district hired Berkeley-based Management Analysis and Planning 
Associates to develop a profile of the qualities community members would like 
in a superintendent. The firm interviewed 150 people over a three-day period 
and received additional comments by letter and fax. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler, a 48-year-old accountant and former city finance commissioner, said he 
is being kept in the "information loop," though he will not be formally seated 
on the board until Dec. 6. He received nearly 25% of the vote Tuesday to defeat 
incumbent Steve McArthur, who joined the board in February. 
</P>
<P>
 McArthur was appointed to fill the seat of former trustee Greg Smith, who was 
appointed to the City Council. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; NEW OFFICIAL WILL HELP CITY ATTRACT BUSINESS

<P>
 A new economic development director is poised to help winners in the City 
Council race fulfill their campaign promises to stimulate business growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The council formally introduced David McElroy as the new economic development 
director during its Election Day meeting.The former administrative manager for 
Riverside County will head a new Department of Economic Development to retain 
and attract business and develop strategic marketing for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our marketing strategy is 'They built a whole county around us,' " McElroy 
said. "In the long term, we're going to be the desirable location of the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy, 47, holds bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in sociology from 
UC Riverside and teaches economic management development at the university's 
extension school. The analytical skills and knowledge of global economy he 
acquired during his graduate years will come in handy in his new job, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His charge is to focus on development projects in the city's northwest 
industrial base, the Chapman-Tustin Avenue corridor and the Old Towne-Chapman 
Avenue district, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council had given City Manager David F. Dixon the go-ahead in July to 
establish a separate department whose chief would report directly to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is clearly to retain existing businesses and help them expand," 
McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new chief said he was lured by the city's potential, but the main draw was 
Dixon himself, whom McElroy knew when Dixon was city manager of Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy is what I consider an expert in economic development," McElroy said. 
"I look at him as a mentor." LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; EXPANSION NIXED FOR CHILD-CARE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission denied an application for an expanded child-care 
facility last week, saying that not enough curbside parking is available at the 
applicant's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Carman Altamirano has been allowed to run a day-care center from her house at 
28885 Woodcreek for six or fewer children. 
</P>
<P>
 A day-care permit for a larger facility would allow Altamirano to take in up 
to 12 children. 
</P>
<P>
 Her house is at the end of a cul-de-sac where several driveways converge onto 
the street within a short distance of each other, leaving little room for 
street parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Several neighbors complained about Altamirano's proposed expansion, saying it 
would lead to more traffic and create a safety problem for several young 
neighborhood children. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff said traffic wouldn't increase significantly if the permit was 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission felt lack of street parking was a problem, voting 4 to 1 to 
turn down Altamirano's application. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to find the business to be compatible with the neighborhood," 
Commissioner Sherri Butterfield said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, we find this application to be incompatible in terms of noise and 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Susan Wilson voted in favor of permitting the large day-care 
center and indicated she would appeal the decision on behalf of Altamirano, 
allowing the $500 appeal fee to be waived. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal will be heard in a public hearing before the City Council at a 
later meeting. FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; AGENCY SEEKS HOUSING PROJECT IDEAS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city Redevelopment Agency wants to see condominiums or single-family 
dwellings developed at Birch Street and Poplar Avenue with a creative design 
that complements the adjacent Brea Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the center is scheduled to begin in December. 
</P>
<P>
 In its request for proposals, which will be sent out to interested developers 
this week, the Redevelopment Agency is seeking a low- to mid-density 
residential project that would have a maximum of 46 units on the 2.6-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 The city currently owns 2.2 acres of the property and anticipates acquiring 
the remaining two parcels from private parties. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 40% of the residential units would be 1,500 square feet or larger and 
have three or more bedrooms.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BUENA PARK; FIRE DEPARTMENT RATES LAST AS ELECTION ISSUE

<P>
 Residents seemed to care less about the closing of their Fire Department and 
more about the future when it elected a new majority to the City Council last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The three challengers who staked their campaigns on restoring the Fire 
Department came in last, and a planning commissioner appears to have narrowly 
edged incumbent Arthur C. Brown out of his seat.But Brown will not concede to 
Larry T. Wieck before thousands of outstanding ballots are counted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no, not with only 34 votes between us," Brown said, adding that he felt 
he "should have walked some of the precincts I discounted." 
</P>
<P>
 Wieck said he feels certain of victory and said he would push his colleagues 
to be more aggressive once the election is settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can no longer sit back and wait for things to happen," he said. "The city 
is a board of directors running a $35-million business." 
</P>
<P>
 The winners said they believe the voters were telling them to put business 
growth above all else in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, top vote-getter Patsy Marshall said "the election showed 
nationally that constituents want their government run more like a business." 
Marshall said she plans to work on a five-year plan and to begin a long study 
of transportation issues, which previously had been Brown's forte. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is facing massive, disruptive construction projects on Beach 
Boulevard, the San Diego-Riverside Freeway interchange and Dale Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all going to have to do some research and work with the state to see 
what we can" to minimize the economic impact these projects have on the city, 
Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commission Chairman Gerald N. Sigler, who won election to the 
council, said he will begin to streamline the paperwork at City Hall. LESLEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CYPRESS; CARD CLUB OPPOSITION BOOSTS 2 OF 3 WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents' opposition to card clubs carried enough weight to secure the 
election of two newcomers to the City Council last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Councilman Walter K. Bowman was also reelected, but he finished 
behind the newcomers, Tom Carroll and Mary Ann Jones. Carroll finished first 
among seven candidates with 17.8% of the vote. Jones, with 16.4%, finished 
second, and Bowman was third in the race for three seats with 15.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll and Jones, both making their first bids for elective office, were 
backed by Cypress Citizens Against Card Clubs. That organization led the 
successful drive in 1993 to defeat a ballot issue that would have authorized 
card clubs at Los Alamitos Race Track. 
</P>
<P>
 "The election Tuesday sent a message that we are opposed to card clubs and 
it's still a hot issue in this city," said Tim Keenan, a spokesman for Cypress 
Citizens Against Card Clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll, in an interview, said he found in door-to-door campaigning that 
opposition to card clubs was a dominant issue among Cypress residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would tell me they don't want a card club in Cypress," Carroll said. 
"They're not opposed to recreational gambling in a place like Las Vegas. But 
they don't want it in Cypress." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, in a separate interview, said she also found strong opposition to card 
clubs. "People said they were concerned about crime that is associated with 
card clubs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Carroll and Jones said that a late-blooming issue in the city involves 
the incumbent council's vote on Sept. 26 to allow construction of a large 
carpet-distribution warehouse on Valley View Street. 
</P>
<P>
 A new residents' group has filed suit in Orange County Superior Court to 
challenge the council's action. Carroll and Jones said they have taken no stand 
on the warehouse issue, pending a study of the matter and the outcome of the 
legal case. But both pledged to be open-minded to residents' concerns. BILL

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; 2 WINNERS GET READY TO PUSH FOR LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters showed their top priority last week by electing two pro-library 
candidates to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the pressure is on the new council to show how quickly it can start 
construction of the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to fast track the library, definitely," said Mayor Susan 
Withrow, who finished first in Tuesday's election. "I think that would reflect 
what a majority of the community wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Withrow and her running mate, council member-elect Sherri Butterfield, 
campaigned hard on the promise of building a library to replace the current 
facility.  
</P>
<P>
 They finished one-two in the polls in a field of seven, with three seats to be 
filled by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see us move in an orderly manner to swift completion of the 
library," Butterfield said. "We have a lot of work in front of us." 
</P>
<P>
 But their opponents in the recent election say the vote wasn't necessarily a 
mandate for an open checkbook to spend lavishly on the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Running on a platform of fiscal responsibility, Councilman-elect Larry Smith 
and Larry Gilbert ran hard behind the top vote-getters.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith wound up some 500 votes behind Butterfield and Gilbert was just over 
1,000 votes out of the third open council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Both saw their finishes as proof that Mission Viejo taxpayers want city 
spending to be managed more carefully, even on the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, I believe I got a message out indicating there is out of 
control spending in City Hall," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said his initial hope is "that we are going to have unified decisions 
that will have positive consequences for the future, not the knee-jerk 
decisions the council has made in our city's infancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan to provide this council enough information on the library so we can 
make good decisions." FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY ASSERTS DESIRE TO KEEP WETLANDS A 
BIO-DIVERSITY PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council last week voted to send the county a loud and clear message 
that the city's preference is to keep Bolsa Chica wetlands a bio-diversity 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 2 to ask the county Board of Supervisors to preserve 
the entire wetlands and adjacent land. Supervisors are expected to consider a 
development proposal for Bolsa Chica in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Jim Silva and Earle Robitaille cast the opposing votes. The new 
council, with three new members, will take office Dec. 5. The new lineup on the 
council is considered more pro-development than the existing council, but it is 
unclear whether it will take a position on the development. 
</P>
<P>
 The current council also authorized a letter asking the county to include the 
city in negotiations for a development agreement with Koll Real Estate Group. 
Koll is proposing to build 4,286 homes on the property and restore 1,100 acres 
of wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The county, however, has proposed alternate plans that include allowing up to 
3,300 homes and construction of a tidal inlet. 
</P>
<P>
 As a bio-diversity park, the entire property would be used for conservation 
purposes with passive recreation uses, native habitat restoration and 
environmental education opportunities. This plan could be realized if the 
property owner agreed to a land swap or purchase of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city, in its comments to the county, also recommended a list of 
guidelines should housing development occur on the wetlands.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the city's suggestions is that a Bolsa Chica project should be a 
financial benefit to the city and include a plan to deliver services with the 
least cost to Bolsa Chica residents and least impact to the city's residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city wants the project to be a balanced community with a mix 
of land uses; consistent with city development standards, and designed as if it 
would be annexed to the city. The city also wants historically significant 
structures and cultural artifacts preserved. DEBRA CANO

FIRE DESTROYS 2 VEHICLES, DAMAGES 4 CARPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire early Sunday morning damaged four carports and destroyed two vehicles 
at an apartment complex on State College Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators are trying to determine the cause of the 1 a.m. blaze. A 
fire spokesman estimated the cost of the damages at about $20,000. No one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire occurred at the Chaparral apartment complex at 1221 N. State College 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 When firefighters arrived at the scene just after 1 a.m., four carports in the 
apartment complex were burning. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 37 firefighters about 10 minutes to contain the blaze, the spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 No dwellings were damaged in the blaze.

BORDER PATROL REOPENS SAN CLEMENTE CHECKPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Border Patrol reopened its checkpoint along Interstate 5 on Sunday 
afternoon, entering another phase of a test to determine whether the operation 
there is effective, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoint had been closed for the past six weeks while its agents were 
redeployed to the border to beef up enforcement there, Assistant Border Patrol 
Agent Ted Swofford said.The redeployment was part of a test to decide whether 
the San Clemente checkpoint ought to be permanently kept or closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Swofford said motorists going through the reopened Interstate 5 checkpoint, 
just south of the Orange County line, were not significantly delayed Sunday, 
waiting a maximum of 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few hours of opening, he said, agents seized 654 pounds of marijuana 
and arrested an illegal immigrant from Mexico and a legal resident on suspicion 
of transporting a controlled substance in a U-Haul truck, Swofford said. The 
illegal immigrant was identified as Jaime Ruiz-Placencia, 24, of Tijuana. The 
legal resident was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Swofford said checkpoint agents were glad to end their commute to the San 
Ysidro border area, but he said some had appreciated the change of pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Clemente checkpoint is scheduled to remain open until February, when 
it will be shut down again while its agents are redeployed to the border for 
about two weeks. After that, Swofford said, a final decision should be made on 
the status of the San Clemente checkpoint, which has existed since 1924.

FATHER TURNS IN 'MISSING' 2-YEAR-OLD; CUSTODY: BUENA PARK POLICE SAY GIRL IS IN 
COUNTY FACILITY PENDING REVIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 2-year-old girl was taken unharmed to the city's police station Sunday, a 
day after her father reportedly abducted her during a struggle at a 
baby-sitter's apartment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, Desire Stine, was placed in the Orangewood Children's Home while 
county social services officials assessed the case and met with her parents, 
said police Sgt. Robert R. Chaney Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators, who on Saturday feared Desire had been kidnaped, said Sunday 
that they have no immediate plans to arrest her father, Michael Ray Stine, a 
35-year-old Buena Park resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Desire was reported abducted Saturday afternoon after Stine allegedly burst 
into a baby-sitter's apartment and demanded his daughter, police said. When the 
baby-sitter and another person tried to prevent Stine from taking the child, 
witnesses said Stine pushed them and "tried to swing the kid like a baseball 
bat," according to Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
 Stine called police several times Saturday night and Sunday morning to insist 
that he had legal custody of Desire. "He saw his picture flash on the 
television and said he couldn't understand why people were making such a big 
deal about it," Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday afternoon, Stine brought his daughter to a Buena Park motel where 
his wife, Lisa Stine, resides. The three then went to the police station. Stine 
gave Desire to his wife but decided not to go into the station with them, 
Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stines have been separated for about a year but continued to have "an 
on-again, off-again" relationship, Chaney said. Police had visited the family's 
apartment several times over the last year on disturbing the peace and domestic 
disturbances calls, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents shared temporary joint custody of Desire pending a final court 
hearing, but they often argued about the arrangement and sometimes one took the 
child against the other's will, Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Desire was transported Sunday afternoon to Orangewood, where she will live 
until a social worker meets with her parents to discuss the custody 
arrangement. Police investigators also plan to monitor the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main concern in this whole case is for the welfare of the child," Chaney 
said. "We have to make that our first priority. Where the parents fit in is 
secondary." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Stine is not sought by police, investigators "would be interested in 
talking to him to get his side of the story," Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his phone conversations with police, Stine expressed a willingness to 
talk with police about the case, Cheney said. But Lisa Stine told police her 
husband decided against entering the police station out of fear that he might 
be arrested.

MIKE PENNER: THERE'S PLENTY OF BLAME TO SHARE FOR THIS DEBACLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Pathetic," was Shane Conlan's word for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stupid," Chris Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ridiculous," Todd Lyght muttered. 
</P>
<P>
 And in another corner of the locker room, Jackie Slater sadly shook his head 
and noted, "A little bit of dishonor was involved here." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, these Rams weren't talking about the Rams' playbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the Rams' play in Sunday's dreary 20-17 loss at home to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the Rams' playoff chances after dropping to 4-6 with road games at San 
Francisco and San Diego next on the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 These Rams were talking about Ram fans. And Raider fans. The two of them, 
mixed together in the Anaheim Stadium aisles like some breathing, heaving 
Molotov cocktail -- igniting every few minutes into bare-knuckled brawls that 
sent bodies spilling over seats and Anaheim police units charging from section 
to section, making more sweeps than Jerome Bettis and Harvey Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I looked up," Ram safety Anthony Newman said, "another fight was 
breaking out. They just kept fighting and fighting and fighting. . . . These 
people were out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen arrests. Fifty-five ejections. An estimated 20 to 25 separate 
altercations, according to Anaheim police Sgt. Gerald Stec, who heads the 
department's stadium detail. Most of the fights erupted during the second half, 
after enough beer had fermented inside enough bellies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tight end Troy Drayton, a second-year man from Penn State, said he had never 
seen anything like it. Before Sunday, Drayton thought Pitt-Penn State was the 
epitome of pigskin-related intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 "In college, we had our rivals," Drayton said, "but we never had fans fighting 
in the stands. In high school, you'd see some scuffles here and there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the people here seem to hate each other that much. Really, 
they were trying to kill each other." 
</P>
<P>
 It made for an afternoon of surreal spectacle. Ram and Raider players hugged 
on the field after the game, after Ram and Raider fans had slugged their way 
through it. In the press box, binoculars trained not on the action on third and 
one, but on the action in Section 271. Anaheim Stadium's beefed-up security 
force featured more yellow jackets than you'd find at a Georgia Tech game -- 
most of them on the move most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman blamed it on the undesirables who moved on down the freeway Sunday to 
spend a few hours in Orange County with their fists clenched. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look up in the stands and you see nothing but Raider shirts, people 
drinking and carrying on," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played in every stadium in the league and the only place this kind of 
thing happens is at the Coliseum -- and here, when we play the Raiders. A lot 
of Raider fans come here looking to fight people, not watch a football game. 
That's why a lot of people don't go to Raider games . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "You have family here. Kids. It's a danger. I had friends and relatives in the 
stands today, but they were scattered. You're worried every time you see a 
fight break out. You hope it's not in the section they're in." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like we get that every time we play the Raiders," Slater said. "It's 
pretty unfortunate. But I'm sure if you ask the Raiders, they're saying the 
same things. Just like us, they're looking over their shoulders, hoping one of 
their friends isn't getting hurt or thrown out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Raider fans, as Lyght diplomatically worded it, "are different. They're a 
little more intense than those of most NFL clubs. That's the way they do it." 
</P>
<P>
 But, it takes two to tangle, no? 
</P>
<P>
 If those were Raider fans delivering the first punch, who were those blue- and 
gold-shirted mugs behind the second, fourth and sixth punches? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Ram fans and Raider fans alike should be ashamed," Slater said. "A 
little bit of dishonor was involved here. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see someone you recognize as a Ram fan and he's all pumped up and he's 
telling you he got in a fight. What are we teaching our kids? What did you 
teach that teen-ager sitting next to you? That preteen-ager?" 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Sean Gilbert said, "I would hope that we have mature fans who 
just come and watch the game. The Raider fans don't like the Ram fans, but 
there's got to be a better way to work it out other than violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we can move one of the teams out of the area. Or maybe both of them. To 
some place safer than the View level at an NFL game in east Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Some place like, say, St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Or Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Where else? Detroit? No, Detroit already has a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be enough violence on the field to satisfy everybody," Lyght 
surmised. "Just sit back, relax and enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But so many of these guys want to knuckle it up. We ought to have them show 
up at two-a-days. Give them some pads and let them go at it. Come on out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have enough uniforms for everybody."

HARD TIME FOR CHRIS TANDEM; FOOTBALL: EACH WEEK, ONE OF THE RAM QUARTERBACKS 
GETS BATTERED AND CONFUSED. RAIDER GAME WAS NO EXCEPTION.

<P>
 It was another round of tag-team quarterbacks for the Rams. Sunday, it was 
Chris Chandler's turn to get tagged. 
</P>
<P>
 There he was, having one of the best afternoons of his career. Chandler was 
carrying the team on his back. Then he was flat on it and it was Chandler who 
was being carried . . . off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 He left late in the second quarter, after the Raiders' Chester McGlockton 
ground Chandler's already tender left ankle into the Anaheim Stadium turf. 
</P>
<P>
 In came out-patient Chris Miller, still somewhat groggy from his previous 
early exits. By the time he warmed up, the Raiders were in control. In the end, 
the Rams had lost their quarterback and the game, 20-17. It was the fourth time 
this season the Rams' starting quarterback didn't finish because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's because we're both named Chris or something like that," Miller 
said. "I don't know anyone else who is playing musical quarterbacks off the top 
of my head." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, anything off the top of Miller's head may be a little suspect. 
After all, concussions have knocked him out of games against San Francisco and 
New Orleans this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Those problems lingered. Miller had more head examinations Wednesday. The 
results showed that he had a case of whiplash, the dull thud from which 
lingered through Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, as Chandler was on target. He had completed 10 of 11 passes for 
171 yards and a touchdown. He had the Rams on the Raider 15 when McGlockton and 
Nolan Harrison double-teamed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they got him with the old high-low," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the what you do against the Rams these days. You hit Miller high and 
Chandler low. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second KO for Chandler. He left against Atlanta earlier this 
season because of a sprained ankle. The situations were all too similar. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chandler led the Rams to a victory over Kansas City. Optimism was high, as 
the Rams looked to win consecutive games for the first time since 1991. Then 
the Falcons got to Chandler and the Rams lost two of three with Miller at 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Then Miller was turned into a head case by the Saints. He suffered his 
second concussion of the seasons and the problems persisted. In stepped 
Chandler to lead the Rams to a victory over Denver and all that playoff talk 
began again. 
</P>
<P>
 The optimism remained high as halftime approached Sunday. Chandler threw a 
22-yard touchdown pass to Flipper Anderson in the first quarter to tie the 
score. He was moving the Rams to another tying touchdown in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came McGlockton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why it has to happen," Chandler said. "We were doing 
everything we wanted to do and doing them at will. It's frustrating. It's 
really, really frustrating. I don't think I could have played any better the 
last two games and now this happens." 
</P>
<P>
 While Chandler was looking for answers, Miller was looking for his touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw Chris go down and got ready as quick as I could," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 His first pass was on target to Isaac Bruce in the end zone, but defensive 
back Donald Frank batted the pass away at the last moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're thrown in there, it takes time to get used to the speed of the 
game," said Chandler, who has his share of relief work. "You have to make quick 
reads and get the ball off fast. The more you're in there, the slower the game 
seems." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Miller was up to speed, the Rams were down, 17-7. Miller was two 
of five for 17 yards by the end of the third quarter, as the Raiders kept the 
ball away from him with two long drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller finished 13 of 26 for 131 yards. He drove the Rams to a field goal and 
threw a late touchdown pass to Todd Kinchen. But between, he was intercepted by 
defensive back Terry McDaniel, which led to a Raider field goal and the 
difference in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, who was on crutches in the second half, could only watch. He will be 
evaluated today. So Miller, until further notice, is the Ram quarterback, even 
if that's not the safest of spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been bizarre," Miller said. "We'll try to stay healthy in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the past, even if Chandler is not be ready to start next Sunday, 
he better be ready to play.

RAM NOTEBOOK; THERE'S NOT ENOUGH BETTIS TO SUIT DRAYTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER and MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Troy Drayton was unhappy with his role, or lack thereof last week. The Ram 
tight end watched Jerome Bettis slam into the line three times on the goal line 
against Denver and there was nothing to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the Rams had other plays in the book besides Bettis face-first 
dives. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Ram coaches and Drayton were on the same page. He caught a career-high 
six passes for 36 yards. Chris Chandler and Chris Miller, threw the ball all 
over the place. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rams lost, 20-17, to the Raiders. And guess what? Drayton found some 
flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram defeat was due to the fact Bettis didn't get his carries. Bettis, who 
has a 2,000-yard goal for the season, had a career-low 13 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his fifth consecutive game under 100 yards after having four 
consecutive games over 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, they (the Raiders) took our No. 1 offensive weapon away," Drayton 
said. "Our team is better when we mix it up. We need Jerome running up the gut, 
getting 10 to 15 yards a pop. We have to get back to that. We have to find a 
way to get the big man the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so there's a little contradiction there. Drayton got his passes. In fact, 
his receptions represented one-third of his season total. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's no dummy. He knows the Rams need more from Bettis than they got. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Raiders put eight men on the line, which is a compliment to Jerome," 
Drayton said. "We had to adjust and we had to go to what was working and that 
was the pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Which worked out nicely for Drayton. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't really matter," Drayton said. "Nobody is going to remember that I 
caught as many passes as I did today. The only thing they're going to remember 
is we lost." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what was the problem with the running game? 
</P>
<P>
 "We came for a fight today and we lost the battle up front," Bettis said. 
"They just were playing physical. It was rough for us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ram cornerback Darryl Henley said Raider receiver Rocket Ismail hit him in the 
face on a second-quarter touchdown catch and criticized game officials for 
missing "blatant calls." 
</P>
<P>
 "He hit me right in my face, knocked my helmet up and everything," Henley 
said. "If I do it, it's a big 15 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley intercepted a Jeff Hostetler pass and returned it 23 yards in the 
second. He dived to intercept another pass in the third quarter, but it was 
waved off by an official. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley said he caught the ball cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's spilled milk," Henley said. "I had it in my hands and I wasn't 
bobbling it. But that's a judgment call, and I'm not complaining about that. 
I'm talking about blatant calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's going to be right, then make it right. If it's not, then don't call 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After making a 22-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, Ram kicker Tony 
Zendejas was seen booting his kicking tee in disgust near the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was frustrated," Zendejas said. "That's all." 
</P>
<P>
 Zendejas' streak of 12 consecutive field goals had come to an end in the 
second quarter when he was wide left on a 41-yard attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Todd Kinchen held on the kick because the regular holder, 
quarterback Chris Chandler, had sprained his left ankle and was out of the 
game. Zendejas did not fault Kinchen's hold for missing the kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just missed it," he said. "That happens once in a while. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie Hester extended his streak of games with at least one catch to 72 with 
a 29-yard reception in the first quarter. . . . Flipper Anderson's 105 yards 
receiving was the ninth 100-yard plus game of his career. . . . The Rams' 
83-yard touchdown drive in the first quarter was their longest of the season.

IT'S SCHUTZ'S TURN TO STEP INTO SPOTLIGHT; VOLLEYBALL: SENIOR IS BIG REASON 
NEWPORT HARBOR HAS ADVANCED TO QUARTERFINALS OF PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Middle blocker Melissa Schutz is regarded as one of the county's top players, 
but she had only 11 kills Thursday in Newport Harbor's four-game playoff 
victory over Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get her the ball enough," Newport Harbor Coach Dan Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
 What a nice problem to have. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Sailors weren't efficient enough for their coach, outside hitter 
Misty May carried the load with 27 kills, helping them advance to Tuesday's 
quarterfinals. The Sailors play host to Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 Although May, The Times 1993 player of the year, garners most of the 
attention, Schutz has been just as instrumental to the Sailors' climb to 
prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor is the No. 1 ranked team in the State and top-seeded team in 
the Southern Section Division I girls' volleyball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors are a well-rounded team, but Schutz is one of the centerpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's got to be a reason why she was the No. 1 choice of the schools who 
were recruiting her," said Charlie Brande, Orange County Club volleyball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she is only 6 feet, small by Division I college volleyball standards, 
Schutz's quickness and athletic ability set her apart. Duke and UCLA were among 
the schools that recruited her, but she chose Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Orange County Club volleyball teammate, Calvary Chapel's Courtney Owens, 
has orally committed to Colorado, and The Times 1992 player of the year, Laguna 
Beach's Rachel Wacholder, also plays for the Buffaloes. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn is among many coaches who feel Colorado is fortunate to have landed 
Schutz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Melissa is probably the best middle attacker I've had," said Glenn, who has 
coached at Newport Harbor for nine seasons. "But she's just scratching the 
surface. She's still figuring out the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'll be one of the smaller middles in college, but she's very quick on 
transition. The game's players are getting bigger, but you can't teach 
quickness and that's what wins." 
</P>
<P>
 The only time the Sailors haven't won this season was a Nov. 4 match against 
San Jose Archbishop Mitty. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second round of the Santa Barbara tournament, the Sailors played 
without setter Janette Hecker and lost in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all needed to step up in that match, but there were some who didn't," 
Schutz said. "Hopefully we'll learn from it." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss knocked the Sailors out of the top spot in a national high school 
volleyball poll -- The Mizuno Top 25 -- published by USA Today. Newport Harbor 
is currently second and Lincoln (Neb.) East is No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't put much stock in a poll," Glenn said. "That's just some opinions. 
Now a CIF title, that's won on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Schutz has experienced a championship season, helping Newport Harbor win the 
State Division III title in 1992 as a sophomore. Last season, the Sailors lost 
in the State Division I and section finals to Corona del Mar, but now they're 
ready to take the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we have the talent to do it, we just have to put it all together," 
Schutz said. "It's all emotional and mental now." 
</P>
<P>
 Those are things that didn't come easily to Schutz when she arrived at Newport 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 As freshmen, Schutz and May played significant roles on a senior-dominated 
team that featured all-county players Tara Kroesch and Maureen McLaren. It was 
a tough adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once that season, Melissa came back to the huddle crying," Glenn said. "I 
think Mo got in her face. Mo was so competitive, she tried to get that across 
to Melissa." 
</P>
<P>
 Something clicked because Schutz has followed McLaren's footsteps. McLaren, 
now playing volleyball for Stanford, also was a standout basketball player and 
swimmer at Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Schutz figures to earn her 12th varsity letter before she graduates. After she 
finishes volleyball season, she will play basketball then swim the freestyle 
for the Sailors' swim team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very rare for someone to even attempt to do what she does," Brande said. 
"The time demands with club practices, your high school practices, and keeping 
up with your studies, and to be that strong to succeed in all of them . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "And she epitomizes what a team player is all about. Whenever they needed her, 
Melissa has always stepped it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Schutz: "I don't do this for the recognition, I'm just doing what I love 
to do. While the accomplishments are nice, what you remember are the 
friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best friends are on this team, so it's a little different than basketball 
or swimming. This team is as special as it gets."

ANGELS FIND CRACK IN THEIR PLAN TO DEAL AWAY MAGRANE; BASEBALL: INJURIES THE 
PITCHER SUSTAINED IN LATE OCTOBER CAR ACCIDENT LESSEN HIS VALUE ON THE TRADE 
MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, rebuffed in their efforts to buy out pitcher Joe Magrane's 
contract, have virtually no chance of trading him. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane suffered a cracked rib and cuts on his pitching arm in a one-car 
accident in October near his home in St. Louis, dispelling thoughts about 
winter ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping to get him pitching this winter in the Dominican or 
Venezuela," Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann said Sunday. "It's something we 
thought he needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the accident took care of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred in late October, according to Magrane's relatives, when 
Magrane and his wife, Renee, crashed while driving on a road under 
construction. There was a drop-off they failed to see, causing the car to go 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane's injuries did not require surgery, and he is expected to resume 
workouts in January. Renee suffered bruised ribs and whiplash. 
</P>
<P>
 It simply was the latest in a series of setbacks to Magrane since signing a 
two-year, $3.5 million contract last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane, who missed the first month of the season recovering from arthroscopic 
elbow surgery, finished the year with a 2-6 record and 7.30 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 He made only 11 starts before being yanked out of the rotation July 2, and 
spent the rest of the season in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a 10.38 ERA as a reliever, and was never used in a game the Angels won. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels recently offered a buyout settlement that would enable him to 
become a free agent, but Magrane was not interested. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are obligated to pay Magrane $1.5 million in 1995, and could be 
responsible for another $1.5 million in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a clause in Magrane's contract that requires the Angels to pick up his 
1996 option if he is not on the disabled list at the end of the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels can avert the possibility only by trading or releasing him. 
</P>
<P>
 If Magrane is released, the Angels would be obligated to pay a $500,000 buyout 
for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to make this work," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi 
said. "We'll just have to see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lachemann: "It's somewhat of a long shot, but we'll give him an 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I give him a lot of credit. He could have been bitching and moaning about 
the way he was used this year, but he never complained. He still wants to prove 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 In other news Sunday, the Minnesota Twins told the Angels that bullpen stopper 
Rick Aguilera is off the trading block. 
</P>
<P>
 Twin General Manager Terry Ryan has decided to keep Aguilera as long as the 
Twins stay in the race in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels attempted to acquire Aguilera before the July 31 trading deadline 
in a deal that would have sent pitcher Andrew Lorraine, first baseman J.T. 
Snow, minor league reliever Troy Percival and two prospects to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan says he has no interest in resurrecting the trade, nor in dealing 
right-handed starter Scott Erickson to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, we'd still like to get a closer," Lachemann said, "but I think we 
realize it's not going to be easy. Percival could fill that role one day, but 
I'd like to ease him into that." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Sunday, former Angel third-base coach Ken Macha has been offered the job 
to become manager of the Boston Red Sox's double-A team in Trenton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Angel first-base coach Max Oliveras, who also was fired by Lachemann in 
October, is a finalist to become the Chicago Cubs' bullpen coach.

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER: MANN WANTS TO PROVE HE'LL DO RIGHT THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About a year from now, if one kid's "hoop dream" comes true, the top high 
school basketball player in California's class of 1996 will sign a college 
letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
 And with those few strokes of his pen, Olujumi Mann of Santa Ana Valley will 
have achieved one of the most important goals of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "My plan is to prove all those people wrong who say that I'm going to mess 
things up," Mann said. "I want to show the people who have supported me that 
all their work wasn't for naught." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, a 6-foot-4, 183-pound point guard with a spectacular arsenal of 
playmaking and scoring skills, is the consensus choice of college coaches and 
talent evaluators as the outstanding junior prospect in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 After transferring from Mater Dei, he averaged 22 points, six rebounds and 
seven assists as a sophomore last season, leading Santa Ana Valley to the 
Southern Section Division I-AA semifinals. A Times first-team all-county 
selection, Mann also made 73 three-pointers (44.5% from the field) and had 116 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a tremendous amount of respect for Olujumi Mann," said Bob Gottlieb, a 
former college coach who is active as an Orange County youth league coach and 
personal instructor. Gottlieb's son, Doug, a senior point guard at Tustin, 
signed with Notre Dame last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he stays healthy, and with normal maturity, Olujumi is not only an NBA 
prospect, I think he has a chance to be the next Magic Johnson. He has the 
talent, skill and instincts. But he hasn't done a very good job academically, 
either at Mater Dei or Santa Ana Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 It's academics that is foremost on the minds of Mann and his father, Richard, 
a loan services manager for a Huntington Beach mortgage company who played 
freshman basketball at Purdue in 1970-71. Richard Mann raised his son as a 
single parent living in Albuquerque, N.M., before a job transfer brought him to 
Orange County eight years ago. He has since remarried. 
</P>
<P>
 "My counselor (Lynn Kramer) tells me every day that I need to have at least a 
'C' average to play as a freshman in college," said Mann, who plans to take the 
Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test in January, with hopes of achieving the 
necessary score on his SAT in time to sign a letter of intent next November 
(this year's one-week signing period for seniors ends Wednesday). 
</P>
<P>
 Mann's first name might be unique to him -- according to Richard Mann, 
"Olujumi" was an African king whose name means "God Gave Us This Much Love in 
Our Child" -- but college coaches throughout the country have been talking 
about him since he helped lead Pat Barrett's Performance Training Institute 
team to a third-place finish at the 14-and-under AAU championships four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Mann) is one of the outstanding juniors in the country," said one college 
assistant coach. "He can penetrate, he's strong, he can create shots, and he 
has a great court awareness. As he matures and understands the game more and 
more, he will be one of the truly outstanding guards in college basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, who turned 18 last Monday, makes no secret of his favorite college: 
UCLA. He has been a regular visitor to Pauley Pavilion since he was in eighth 
grade. Mann knows most of the Bruin players, and was a PTI teammate last spring 
of 6-10 center-forward Jelani McCoy, a San Diego St. Augustine senior who 
signed with UCLA last week. On the day he gave the Bruins an oral commitment, 
McCoy called Mann and urged him to join him at UCLA next year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mann said he is also considering three other schools: California, 
Kentucky and Purdue. He said he will "definitely" attend the UCLA-Kentucky game 
Dec. 3 at The Pond of Anaheim, part of the John R. Wooden Classic that also 
includes a game between Kansas and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 But first there is the matter of a game to be played the night before, when 
Santa Ana Valley plays host to Tustin in a dream matchup of two top point 
guards: Mann and Gottlieb. And if Mann has his way, it won't be the last time 
he goes head-to-head with Gottlieb, whose game he says he admires. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to win the NCAA championship my freshman year in college, and be a 
big part of it," he said. "And you know who I'd like to win it against? Notre 
Dame and Doug Gottlieb." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Giesen (6-6, 295) of Sunny Hills, one of the top offensive line prospects 
in Southern California, said he will take recruiting trips to four schools: 
Nebraska, Colorado, Arizona and UCLA. At UCLA, he would be reunited with a 
former teammate, Brian Willmer, a redshirt freshman linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the premier community college prospects in California, sophomore 
linebacker Kasun Charles (6-2, 230) of Long Beach City College, was shot and 
killed last Monday night near his Wilmington home. Police believe the incident 
was gang-related, though Charles was not known to be connected to any gangs. 
Charles, a Wilmington Banning graduate and the Vikings' defensive leader, had 
already lined up recruiting trips to USC, UCLA, Pittsburgh and San Diego State 
before he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoop report: Los Alamitos point guard Ali Ton, a 6-footer who averaged about 
10 assists and four steals last season and was an All-Empire League choice, has 
not been offered a scholarship to a Division I school. He has been contacted by 
coaches from Long Beach State, Cal Poly Pomona and several Division III 
schools, including Claremont-Mudd and Redlands. Brigham Young had showed 
interest during the summer, but not recently. Ton, a native of Turkey who came 
to the United States three years ago, hopes to attract some scholarship offers 
from larger schools this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Early returns: Former Mater Dei guard Miles Simon, a 6-4 freshman and key 
member of Arizona's highly regarded recruiting class, was high scorer with 25 
points in the Wildcats' annual Red-Blue scrimmage last week. Simon hit eight of 
12 shots, including the game-winning basket in the final second. "I knew Miles 
would be good, but he has exceeded my expectations so far," Arizona Coach Lute 
Olson said. "Other than Damon Stoudamire, he's been our best three-point 
shooter. He comes from a great program, which makes our job so much easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery, on Servite High's Mark Seaton, a 6-9 forward 
who signed with the Cardinal last week: "Mark should be a great fit for us, 
playing with (7-1 freshman center) Tim Young. He has matured physically, and 
made tremendous improvement over the summer. It was real important for us that 
he committed early; he became the centerpiece for the rest of our recruiting 
class." Seaton was one of 16 seniors from the western United States selected 
recently to the Long Beach Press-Telegram's annual Best in the West basketball 
team. He finished seventh in balloting by college coaches and scouts, behind 
Tustin guard Doug Gottlieb. The top vote-getter was 6-7 guard-forward Paul 
Pierce of Inglewood High, who received 506 of a possible 510 points. 
</P>
<P>
 More Pac-10 news: Cal lost one of its top recruits when 6-7 forward Derek Hood 
of Kansas City, Mo., signed with Arkansas. Hood had visited Berkeley recently, 
and also considered Kansas. However, the Bears fared better out of state 
(signing 6-9 Shareef Abdur-Rahim of Marietta, Ga., and 6-10 Kenyon Jones of 
Savannah, Ga.) than USC, which lost Jones, 6-7 Juan Gaston of Decatur, Ga. 
(Georgia Tech) and 6-6 Michael Gill of Washington, D.C. (Pittsburgh) . . . 5-10 
point guard Duane Davis of Los Angeles Fairfax chose Arizona State over Santa 
Clara . . . Donte Quinine, a 6-6 swingman from Rowland Heights Rowland who had 
orally committed to Oregon, changed his mind and signed with Utah. However, the 
Ducks are considered the favorite to sign former UC Santa Barbara standout Rob 
Ramaker, now at Santa Barbara City College. Ramaker, a 6-10 forward, was one of 
the top freshmen in the Big West last season. If he signs with Oregon, Ramaker 
would rejoin 6-8 forward Kyle Milling, who also left UCSB after last season. 
</P>
<P>
 New Nevada Las Vegas Coach Tim Grgurich has confided to friends that he 
believes he has a chance to sign the top two seniors in California -- Pierce 
and 6-5 Tommy Prince of Compton Dominguez. Both have decided to wait until 
April before signing letters of intent, a fact that Grgurich believes should 
help UNLV.

<P>
 A team on the rise, the Spartans should match the three victories they 
recorded last season pretty early, possibly in the first three games. 
Chenowith, alone, should put them in second place at the end of the league 
season. He has grown 3 1/2 inches in a year and the improvement in his game has 
also been significant. He averaged six points last season, but that should go 
way up this season. Just how big a turnaround the Spartans experience depends 
on the supporting cast. Furuta gets a lot out of his size. He averaged six 
points and was an honorable mention all-league selection. He will provide 
stability at point guard. Then come the questions. Hutson was a key reserve and 
likely will fill a starting spot. Hutson is the team's best outside shooter, so 
he'll have the burden of keeping opponents from packing it in on defense. The 
rest will be dumped on the newcomers. There's some size in the group, but also 
many questions. SCHEDULE

 Two intense showdowns led to a co-championship between Orange and Santa Ana 
Valley, two of the top teams in Orange County last season. Orange won the first 
meeting, at its itsy-bitsy, storage-room-of-a-gymnasium. Gil Gonzales scored 22 
points and Pat Harris 19 in a 64-58 victory. Olujimi Mann, Santa Ana Valley's 
standout point guard, had his worst night of the season. He made six of 19 
shots and was 0 for 8 in the fourth quarter. Mann and Co. got their revenge in 
the regular-season finale. Mann scored 28 points in the 64-41 rout. He scored 
14 in the third quarter, including a variety of dunks, as the Falcons blew the 
game open. Santa Ana Valley's success continued into the playoffs. The Falcons 
reached the Southern Section Division I-AA semifinals, where they lost, 69-67, 
to La Crescenta Crescenta Valley. Mann had 30 points, including eight 
three-pointers, six assists, four steals and two blocks. Orange reached the 
quarterfinals of the 1 -- A playoffs, but lost to Edison, 63-53. Harris had 21 
points, but Gonzales scored only four. He had 24 in the previous game, a 69-61 
victory over Corona. Foothill qualified for the III-A playoffs, but lost to 
top-seeded Sonora, 71-48, in the first round. Mann averaged 21.9 points, 7.2 
assist and 6.6 rebounds. Gonzales averaged 14.3 points and made 79 
three-pointers to give him 171 for his career. Both were named first-team 
All-Orange County.

 Hard to imagine, but the Falcons could top last season's success. They reached 
the Southern Section I-AA semifinals a year ago, but have the talent to go at 
least a step farther. Mann is as good a junior as there is in the nation. A 
year from now, he'll be Orange County's most-recruited player and for good 
reason. He is an exceptional point guard, adept at running an up-tempo offense, 
and a great scorer. He averaged 21.2 points, 7.1 rebounds and 7.3 assists 
during the regular season. Sometimes overlooked are his defensive abilities. 
His long arms and quickness smothered many an opponent. Mann will not have to 
go it alone. Transfers Harmon (Century) and Forbin (Loara), plus Riggins, a 
returning starter, give Mann plenty of options. Riggins averaged 11 points and 
was a second-team all-league selection. Harmon, in particular, should be in for 
a big season. He was a starter at Century last season and gives the Falcons a 
solid inside game. A brutal nonleague schedule should toughen the Falcons for a 
playoff run. SCHEDULE

<P>
 Sabins got some bad news even before his team's first day of practice. Clay 
Kilbarger, the point guard the past two seasons, decided to play soccer this 
year. It's enough to make a basketball coach hate the World Cup. "Yeah, that's 
a pretty critical position to lose a guy at," Sabins said. Into that breech 
steps Duckworth and Hsu. One, or both, will run the Comanche offense. Hsu was 
the starting point guard on the junior varsity. They will battle, but a starter 
might not be picked until league. Rathod may be undersized for a center, but he 
has good leaping ability and was the co-most valuable player on the junior 
varsity. Hoover returns as the team's shooting guard. But it will take him time 
to adjust from football, where he is the starting quarterback. Walker is a 
strong inside player. He averaged 9.3 rebounds and made .515% of his shots last 
season. He also averaged a little more than 10 points, but will need to score 
more this season. He should be helped on the inside by Llewellyn. SCHEDULE

BOYS' BASKETBALL 1994-1995 / CENTURY LEAGUE; HE'S PAYING HIS DUES IN THE BIG 
MAN'S CLUB; BASKETBALL: VILLA PARK'S CHENOWITH, A SOPHOMORE, ADJUSTS TO SIZE 
THROUGH HARD WORK AND HELP FROM FRIENDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome to the big man's club. No one under 6 feet 8 need apply. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Chenowith, Villa Park sophomore, is its youngest member. Actually there 
are only three. All of them big, really big . 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora's Craig Clark, a 7-foot senior at Sonora, and Chris Burgess a 6-9 
sophomore at Woodbridge. In the middle, the 6-10 1/2 Chenowith. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working out together since August," Chenowith said. "It's some 
really intense, hard stuff. I need to go against guys that big." 
</P>
<P>
 It has paid off. A year ago, Chenowith was a gangly 6-7 freshman, thrown into 
an impossible situation. He was asked to be the team's big man without really 
knowing how to play big. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans' 3-20 record can't be hung on him. But he's taking it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to improve last year's record," Chenowith said. "I spent the entire 
summer playing basketball. I don't want to experience another season like the 
last one." 
</P>
<P>
 He shouldn't, not with the work he's put in. Chenowith will probably be enough 
to get the Spartans into the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chenowith is no longer that wide-eyed, rail-thin kid from last season. He's 
beefed up, a full 220 pounds now, and he's a lot more savvy. 
</P>
<P>
 He's adjusted to his size through hard work and a little help from his 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Chenowith had never met Clark before last summer. He had seen him play for 
Sonora, when Clark was a gawky freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 The two met when they began playing for the same traveling team last June. 
They became friends and then workout partners in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember one game during the summer when Eric tripped over his own feet and 
fell," Clark said. "It reminded me of myself a few years ago. It was obvious he 
hadn't become comfortable with his size." 
</P>
<P>
 Chenowith has always been big for his age. In kindergarten, his legs didn't 
fit under the desk. 
</P>
<P>
 He was tall enough that he would sometimes be enlisted to play in a men's 6-2 
and over three-on-three league by his father, Bob Chenowith. Eric was in the 
sixth grade at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Chenowith didn't hit a real growing spurt until the eighth grade. Chenowith 
shot up five inches by the end of the summer, but had no time to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 He had broken a bone in his left foot during a basketball game in May and was 
in a cast for 3 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't get to play the entire summer," Villa Park Coach Steve Harris said. 
"That really set him back." 
</P>
<P>
 And there was no time to catch up. Short of talented players and facing a long 
season, Harris decided to give Chenowith some on-the-job experience. 
</P>
<P>
 He averaged 6.1 points and 5.1 rebounds. "It was beat-up-on-the-freshman all 
season," Chenowith said. "I had these 6-2, 260 guys hit me with elbows. It was 
hard, really hard." 
</P>
<P>
 But he did show some flashes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing Orange and they were hammering us," Harris said. "We were 
down, 16-2, and the only reason we had two was because the Orange fans threw 
hot dogs onto the court at the start of the game and got a technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were hammering us, but I saw Eric handle that pressure. He rebounded and 
scored points. I saw his future that night." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there will take some work, which Chenowith has already started. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot tougher playing the post than people realize," Chenowith said. "I 
remember I would watch Kareem Abdul-Jabbar shoot that sky hook and think, 
'That's easy.' Well, I've tried it and it isn't. I needed to work against guys 
my own size to get comfortable with being this tall."

<P>
 The Vanguards have their second new coach in as many seasons. Roussel replaces 
Steve Middleton, who resigned to become the head coach at Poway Mt. Carmel. A 
couple of league coaches view the Vanguards as a dark horse. Whether that 
proves to be true will depend a lot on some inexperienced players. Villmer, a 
third-year letterman, is a strong inside player, who will need to step up his 
game. He must score in double figures. He showed that ability at times last 
season, including a 28-point effort against Canyon. Goodwin can shoot and is 
also an adept passer. He is the quarterback on the Vanguards' football team. He 
had a 17-point, seven-assist game against Villa Park last season, an 
accomplishment Roussel would like to see more of this season. Of the returning 
players, Lee saw the most court time. The Vanguards lack size, but Roussel 
expects them to be solid defensively. They should be in contention for a 
third-place finish, maybe second if all goes well. SCHEDULE

 The team's strengths, according to Thate, are quickness and shooting ability. 
The Knights will need to be sharp in both areas. This is not the best league to 
be in if your tallest player is 6 feet 3. The Knights, obviously, intend to 
run, so Brittingham and his experience are good to have around. He was an 
honorable mention all-league selection last season, when he averaged six points 
and 9.2 assists. The rest of the team is green, and a rough nonleague schedule 
could lie ahead. Disaia and Brown were starters on the junior varsity. Stern, 
Almquist and Higgins were reserves on the varsity. It'll make for an 
interesting nonleague schedule, as Thate must sort out a regular rotation. 
Expect to see a lot of different defenses and a lot of presses, as the Knights 
must try to hide the fact Almquist is their tallest player. But that can have 
some advantages as well. If the Knights can hit their shots, teams will have a 
nasty time defending them. After a slow start, Foothill was the league's 
third-place team last season, coming in behind county powerhouses Santa Ana 
Valley and Orange. But a similar finish this time around will take some doing.

STUDY URGES L.A. TO PRIVATIZE MORE SERVICES; GOVERNMENT: CONSERVATIVE THINK 
TANK CALLS ON RIORDAN TO FOLLOW UP ON CAMPAIGN PLEDGE TO TURN CITY WORK OVER TO 
OUTSIDE FIRMS. SUCH MOVES COULD SAVE $120 MILLION ANNUALLY, REPORT SAYS.

<P>
 The city of Los Angeles could save at least $120 million a year by turning 
many government services over to private firms, but instead is falling out of 
step with a privatization trend that is sweeping the country, according to a 
report to be released today by a conservative think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reason Foundation study recommends that the city's trash collection, 
paramedic service, workers' compensation claims administration and golf course 
operations be turned over to private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors of the report said they hope that it will re-energize 
privatization proposals that have languished at City Hall, despite the election 
last year of Republican Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan had said he wanted companies to compete with city employees to provide 
city services. But 16 months after campaigning on a plan to put Los Angeles 
International Airport in private hands to pay for more police, Riordan now 
shies away even from a plan to privatize one of the city's golf courses. He 
also has backed away from a plan to hire a private firm to issue parking 
tickets on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Formidable roadblocks to private contracting have been erected by city 
employee unions and some City Council members, and Riordan has chosen to save 
his political muscle for other fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor has a number of priorities," said David Cobb, a mayoral assistant 
who has investigated privatization. "The first one is public safety, then 
economic development, and third is government efficiency. As we work our way 
through the agenda, we might find time for these other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan has said many times that he will not support privatization proposals 
that lay off city workers or rely on paying substandard wages. He also prefers 
to call contracting efforts "competitive benchmarking," saying that the 
practice will allow the city to see how efficiently its departments are run. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors of the report argue, however, that they need the popular mayor to 
lead the charge for the proposals more aggressively. The money saved could be 
used to hire as many as 1,600 police officers, furthering Riordan's top goal of 
public safety, said Reason Foundation President Robert W. Poole Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor needs to do more in the bully pulpit," Poole said. "There are 
structural problems in the city's finances nobody seems to notice. The City 
Council is just going along fat, dumb and happy, as if none of these problems 
are there. We are on a financial precipice and we are saying, 'Wake up, guys!' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 But council members and city union representatives have argued that despite 
the mayor's reassurances, the proposals could cost public workers their jobs or 
force them to do the same work for private firms that pay less and provide 
substandard benefits. They said the contracting efforts would be particularly 
unsettling for minority communities such as South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the Los Angeles-based Reason Foundation rejects those claims, 
saying that private firms can take over with minimal job loss and offer 
competitive pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest savings potential in the city is in garbage collection, the study 
says. Los Angeles spends $21 per housing unit each month to collect trash, 
compared to a range of $9 to $15 for 14 other cities surveyed. As much as $42 
million could be saved if the whole city shifted to private collection, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the high cost of the current system comes from poor maintenance, which 
leaves trash trucks out of service and drivers waiting to start their routes. 
The Reason Foundation report also claims that with as few as 450 households on 
their routes, city refuse workers are less productive than private sector 
workers, who serve 700 homes or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The report suggests the trash haulers should work longer routes or a regular 
eight-hour day, rather than the current system that permits them to go home 
whenever their route is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The report concedes that some benefits are less generous in the private 
sector, but it says wages are about the same. And it claims that city workers 
would not have to lose their jobs, if contracts required that the private firms 
hire displaced city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 But political opposition to trash contracting became clear last January, when 
a majority of the City Council joined rallying workers to say they would block 
any privatization attempts by Riordan. Said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas at 
that Martin Luther King Day event: "Don't balance the budget on the backs of 
working people in the city of Los Angeles!" 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedic service is also targeted for private sector intervention in the 
report, which claims the net savings could be $30 million a year. The primary 
savings would be realized by concentrating private paramedics on shifts when 
they are most needed, rather than the 24-hour shifts that Fire Department 
paramedics work, the report says. The study also suggests that a private firm 
would more aggressively collect bills from people who use emergency medical 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 By having the private ambulance crews respond to calls that are 
life-threatening, Fire Department paramedics would be freed for more pressing 
calls, the report contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Fire Department officials essentially agreed with that position 
earlier this year, following a pilot program that used private ambulances for 
non-emergency calls. But some private ambulance operators raised questions 
about whether they would bid to provide the service in high-crime areas of the 
city, where calls might be more dangerous and bill collections more 
problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 A more receptive political climate might await a proposal -- also advanced in 
the Reason Foundation report -- to have an outside firm administer the city's 
troubled workers' compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, a high-ranking city official was fired after being accused of 
heading a ring that bilked the workers' compensation system out of about $1 
million. And audits have found that the city pays more than twice the national 
average for claims. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those revelations provided the incentive for Councilman Joel Wachs this fall 
to advocate a private takeover of the system. The plan is pending in committee, 
although the city bureaucrats who run the system have advocated a more cautious 
approach that would leave many claims in the hands of city workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reason report suggests that $22 million a year could be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other proposals advocated in the report -- and once fervently pushed by 
Riordan -- now are on the back burner. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan to have a private company issue parking tickets on the Westside has 
given way to talks to "increase the productivity of the city's parking 
enforcement program," said Cobb, the mayoral aide. Union opponents had 
suggested that the private takeover, estimated to increase revenues by $19 
million, would inevitably be expanded and cost city workers their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to turn at least one of the city's 12 golf courses over to a private 
firm has also run into a political obstacle, according to the mayor's office. 
"Unless we can find a council person who will support a golf privatization 
program at one of the courses in their district, we are not going to proceed," 
Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately run golf and other suggestions in the Reason report total about $7 
million more in savings for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of competition in Los Angeles is in contrast to a number of other 
cities that also elected mayors promising greater efficiency, the report 
contends. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley has placed about 40 services under 
contract, from water customer billing to drug treatment. Indianapolis Mayor 
Stephen Goldsmith has saved his city $28 million a year by opening nearly 60 
programs to private contracting. 
</P>
<P>
 And New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has waged an aggressive campaign to hire 
school custodians from private firms to replace public employees who make up to 
$80,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Poole acknowledged that the Los Angeles City Charter gives Riordan less 
power than his counterparts in those cities.

A SUNDAY IN HOG HEAVEN; CHARITY: THE 11TH-ANNUAL LOVE RIDE IN GLENDALE ATTRACTS 
21,000 EASY RIDERS TO A FUND-RAISING EVENT BENEFITING THE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 
ASSN.

<P>
 The good, the bad and the Uglys hit the road again Sunday for the nation's 
biggest motorcycling party -- the Love Ride. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 21,000 bikers, most of them astride powerful Harley-Davidsons and 
some from as far away as Canada, rumbled into Glendale early Sunday for the 
11th annual Glendale-to-Castaic charity ride to benefit the Los Angeles chapter 
of the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands more turned out to see celebrities, to mingle with the bikers before 
the run or to crowd along freeway overpasses while folks like "Ugly Carl" -- a 
Canoga Park motorcycle mechanic on his eighth Love Ride -- roared beneath them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun, it's a good benefit, and it's a great excuse to get together with 
20,000 of my best friends," said Carl, who rides with some 50 entertainers who 
call themselves "The Uglys." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's ride raised more than $1 million for muscular dystrophy clinics 
and summer camps in the area, as well as for medical research, said Joan 
Rovegno, regional director for the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime rider Frank Bizelli, 40, of Burbank, gave up the outlaw biker 
lifestyle many years ago, when he said he had only one charity: himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never would have done this for charity before," he said. "I was in it for 
myself. In the past, had I raised money, I would have kept it for myself and 
stuck it up my arm. . . . But I've been clean and sober for the last six 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of celebrities turned out, including musician Axl Rose, actor Lorenzo 
Lamas, and the ride's grand marshal, "Tonight Show" host Jay Leno. And, with 
the possible exception of Marlon Brando, the most memorable movie cyclist of 
them all was there: Peter Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a timeless thing," said Fonda, whose 1969 performance in "Easy Rider" 
helped to mold the image of the picaresque biker. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get on the bikes, we're not bald or fat or old," Fonda said. "You get 
on a Harley and you're still cool."

RIORDAN'S PITCH: YOU TOO CAN AID; MAYOR'S MANSION MAKEOVER PLAN; REMODELING: 
SUPPORTERS ARE ASKED TO HELP FUND $2.5-MILLION REFURBISHING OF GETTY HOUSE, TO 
BE USED FOR PARTIES AND FOR HOSTING DIGNITARIES.

 If you have $380 that's just burning a hole in your pocket, here's an idea: 
Donate a new wastebasket for Los Angeles' soon-to-be-spruced-up mayor's 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, if money is a bit tight this holiday season, perhaps a $225 antique 
magnifying glass is more to your liking and wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the pitch Sunday as Mayor Richard Riordan entertained about 350 
supporters with a preview of restoration plans at the Getty House, just one day 
before workers are set to begin tearing down walls at the 73-year-old landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan won't follow former Mayor Tom Bradley's lead in living at the Hancock 
Park mansion -- his $6-million Brentwood estate suits him just fine, thanks -- 
but he does want to use the 19-room house for throwing regal parties and 
hosting international dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The design) is subdued and it's elegant," he said between chats in the 
spacious back garden with friends and politicos who paid $100 a ticket to be 
there. "It's a great way of showing off Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 A strong supporter of privatization in government, Riordan says no money from 
the city's strained coffers will be used for the restoration. Instead, a 
private, not-for-profit group -- headed by Riordan's girlfriend, Nancy Daly -- 
has been set up to seek a total of $2.5 million in cash contributions, pro bono 
services and donated furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen local designers showed off their wish-list work Sunday, 
taking guests on tours and displaying photographs and drawings of how they want 
each room to look when it's done. 
</P>
<P>
 One guest already knows what the "before" looks like -- former Mayor Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going heavily into beiges," a designer in the library/sitting room 
explained to Bradley, who was back for the first time in almost 18 months to 
see the home where he lived as mayor for 16 years. "It's very masculine and 
sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Linda Comfort is taking a more playful approach in an upstairs 
children's room and gym, decorating the area around themes from the children's 
classic "Where the Wild Things Are," using footprints, animals and other images 
from the book. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for all this work, however, is serious business, and that was made 
clear to guests Sunday. From the intimate powder room to the wine cellar and 
the sprawling bedroom suites, each virtually empty room had on prominent 
display a list of planned furnishings and what it would cost supporters to 
donate them to the mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the amenities: two $550 iron stools for the kitchen, a set of bathroom 
towel bars for $293, bronze bookends for $811 and a gold-and-jade vase for 
$3,800. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly discount items from the Home Shopping Network, but Selim Zilkha 
didn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bel-Air businessman was so impressed by the plans that he pulled out his 
checkbook and pledged to donate about $25,000 to furnish the entire library. 
That will get him a plaque with his name on it, and the restoration committee's 
great appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the mayor," said Zilkha, a Riordan backer whose company does offshore 
oil and gas exploration in Texas and Louisiana. "The place is very run-down, 
and we need something like this for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The house was built in 1921 for $83,000, and it was later home to Hollywood 
legend John Barrymore and his wife, actress Dolores Costello, among other 
luminaries. The Getty family bought the property in 1957 and donated it to the 
city two decades later. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley is the only Los Angeles mayor to have occupied the official residence, 
but it turns out he left his own legacy behind after moving out. 
</P>
<P>
 Renovators recently came across some old snapshots of the mayor tucked away 
upstairs, and they came upon a hand-stitched screen that Bradley had been 
trying to find. The movers were so rushed when he left office, the former mayor 
said, "there's no telling how many things we left behind." 
</P>
<P>
 If the prices on the designers' wish lists seem high, at least they're one up 
on the Pentagon, whose notorious toilet seats were billed at $640 each. 
</P>
<P>
 The plumber's price tag in the downstairs bathroom of the Getty Mansion is 
$663 -- but for that, you get the whole toilet.

STREET SMART / AARON CURTISS: THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY HELPS MAP OUT THE 
RIGHT ROUTE

 In 1910, the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper described driving as "the last call of 
the wild" and the "world's most exciting sport." Back then -- before SigAlerts 
and 10-lane interstates -- the long-dead Eagle's description was not far off. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1920, most roads were little more than dirt paths that turned to sludge 
in the winter, and what road maps there were pointed out gnarled trees and old 
bridges as landmarks. How things have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 While the basic workings of the internal combustion engine have evolved 
remarkably little since the turn of the century, the accouterments of getting 
from here to there have kept pace with technology. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, commuters can have up-to-the-minute traffic reports 
beamed straight to their home computers or even to their pocket pager. 
Vacationers can plan their entire trip electronically -- all the way down to 
roadside dining and highway lodging. The venerable Thomas Bros. have put their 
ubiquitous map books on CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, even the San Diego Freeway is a part of the celebrated infobahn. 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference from the road trips Michigan novelist Edmund G. Love 
described in the early days of automobility. On a 10-mile stretch between 
Lapeer and Imlay City, Love was stuck in the mud eight times. On another 
occasion, he recalled being hopelessly lost on a detour to Owesso -- only 20 
miles from home. 
</P>
<P>
 While modern technology may offer advantages, it is not always cheap. In fact, 
some of the more sophisticated programs run more than the $290 it cost to buy a 
Ford Model T in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Chevy Chase tried to plan the Griswold family getaway to Wally World in 
the 1983 film "National Lampoon's Vacation," he flipped on the old home 
computer and fought for space on the screen with his game-playing son. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip turned into a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, a slew of computer programs available for under $100 would 
make the Griswold family trip considerably easier. Companies such as DeLorme 
and Rand McNally have put together programs that do essentially what Auto Club 
workers have done for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs detail not only directions but point out sights along the way, as 
well as places to rest for the night and restaurants to sample the local 
culinary fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Two programs tested recently were for planning trips accurately to within a 
few tenths of a mile -- from a quick jaunt between Santa Monica and Arcadia to 
a longer trip from Chatsworth to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Vegas trip, the DeLorme program estimated the trip to take 4 hours, 58 
minutes. It suggested tourist stops along the way at the Gene Autry Western 
Heritage Museum, the Warner Bros. studios and the Descanso Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Vegas, the program suggested a long list of accommodations, from an 
$800 room at the Luxor to a $39 stay at the Motel 6 Las Vegas Tropicana. Half 
an hour outside of town in Jean, a room can be found at Whiskey Pete's Hotel 
and Casino for between $20 and $30. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiskey Pete's doesn't have a fitness center, according to the program, but it 
does have -- not surprisingly -- a cocktail lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 For the local jaunt, the Rand McNally program estimated 36 minutes of driving 
time for a 34-mile trip between Santa Monica and Arcadia. It suggested stops 
along the way at the Westside Pavilion and Santa Monica Place. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar program called GeoFinder takes the familiar Thomas Bros. map books 
into the electronic age. A single CD-ROM contains every map page Thomas Bros. 
covers in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Typing an address takes the user to its precise map page. The user can further 
manipulate the map on the screen by zooming in and out. The final product can 
be printed out. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional attachment to the program will update current traffic conditions 
on major routes, making it possible for someone to check the freeways from an 
office terminal before heading home. (So far, thankfully, motoring with one 
hand on the steering wheel and the other on a portable laptop is not 
recommended.) 
</P>
<P>
 One feature the Thomas Bros. program does not have is a route finder. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do that on GeoFinder," said Glen Jansma, Thomas Bros. vice 
president for business development. "Every market test we've done in Southern 
California -- where people take driving to heart -- is that as soon as you tell 
someone the right way to go, they will tell you that you are crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 But the whole idea of driving is to be out on the open road, not chained to a 
computer terminal. Aldous Huxley's brave new vision of personal helicopters has 
yet to materialize, but at least two products give gridlocked drivers instant 
traffic information to escape tie-ups across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 If radio traffic reports every six minutes just aren't enough, there's now a 
way to scan the roadways every single minute. Consider Autotalk, a device that 
attaches to a car's radio. By typing onto a dash-mounted key pad, drivers can 
hear a dispatcher constantly updating traffic information about the road 
they're on -- or the ones they're headed to. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, if a driver only drives in the northern part of Los Angeles 
County, she might program out reports from all other areas -- thereby blocking 
reports about jackknifed trucks on the northbound Pasadena Freeway while 
heading west on the Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another product called Roadirector is nothing more than a pocket pager. But in 
addition to messages and phone numbers, the Roadirector displays traffic 
information updated every five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Autotalk, Roadirector can be programmed to deliver only the traffic 
reports the user wants. Roadirector marketing director Tak Sit said that 
eventually the company plans to offer a program that will dispatch similar 
reports to hand-held note pad computers like Apple's Newton. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday -- perhaps soon -- everyday cars will be outfitted with on-board 
mapping computers that process information transmitted via satellite. It's 
already happening on test tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 So has all this technology tamed the Eagle's "last call of the wild"? Perhaps, 
though the view from the 405 on a Friday afternoon is far from civilized.

GEORGE RAMOS: FOR LATINOS, LET ELECTION SETBACKS BE CALL FOR ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boy, last week's election results hurt. They hurt because many Latinos now 
think most Californians don't like them. 
</P>
<P>
 It hurts that Proposition 187 won by a wide margin. It hurts that the 
measure's chief shill, Gov. Pete Wilson, won reelection by such a big margin. 
It hurts that despite all the talk about growing political power for Latinos, 
who make up 25% of California's population, the group turned out a paltry 8% of 
the vote. It hurts that Art Torres lost his chance to be the first Latino in 
statewide office in more than 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of Nov. 30, I'm out of a job," Torres said, trying his best to deal with 
the reality that term limits and last week's results have ended his 22-year 
political career. "Sure it hurts, but on the other hand, I don't know any 
Latino who can claim that 3.2 million people voted for him in California." 
</P>
<P>
 The stinging rejection was felt by many of the 600 people who attended a 
black-tie banquet staged the other night in Century City by MALDEF, the 
nation's leading Latino civil rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the night's honorees, Democratic Rep. Xavier Becerra of Los Angeles, 
reassured the subdued dinner crowd that there will be better days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The forecast is for rain," Becerra said, "but there is sun behind those 
clouds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the pain expressed at the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund dinner was a resolve to fight back. Some were gritting their 
teeth, while others, acknowledging the long odds, know they have nothing else 
to lose by waging an uphill struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the fights may seem minor to most, but their significance to L.A. 
Latinos is anything but that. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, greeting friends at the MALDEF dinner was Alhambra civil rights 
attorney R. Samuel Paz, whose nomination for a federal judgeship in L.A. has 
been held up by Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which must pass 
on such appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 With the GOP now firmly in control of the Congress, Paz -- whose nomination 
was considered a cinch by Democrats -- now has little chance of ever getting 
that judgeship. "I'm going to be renominated in the new Congress and I'm 
fighting to the end," Paz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much larger questions loom in the wake of last week's decisive election 
results. In addition to campaigns aimed at coaxing more Latinos to become 
citizens and vote, and to fight Prop. 187 in the courts, here are some 
strategies that Latinos can focus on to lessen the pain: 
</P>
<P>
 * Claim the immigration question as their issue. Rather than opposing 
short-sighted measures such as Proposition 187, Latino leaders should admit 
there is an illegal immigration problem and come up with solutions that will 
highlight U.S. sovereignty, such as: merging the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service and the Customs Service into one super agency; tightening visa 
requirements for visitors and those seeking political asylum; charging $1 to $2 
for those entering the U.S. through border crossings and airports, raising 
funds for more border guards; and sending criminal aliens back to their home 
countries to serve sentences there for crimes committed here. 
</P>
<P>
 * Show more political savvy. It's now clear that the large Downtown L.A. 
protest against Proposition 187 -- complete with thousands of Mexican flags -- 
was a mistake. Whites thinking of voting against the measure were turned off by 
the preference of the marchers, who insisted on claiming their American rights 
by showing off foreign symbols. "If you're going to play the game in this 
country, you have to respect the rules," said Dr. Harry Pachon, president of 
the Tomas Rivera Center in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 * Build on what was accomplished in the recent campaign. The record numbers of 
Latino high school students who marched against Proposition 187 signaled that 
they're ready for more political involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Like their predecessors in the 1960s, these protesters learned some valuable, 
hard lessons about this country. Nearly everybody I talked to at the MALDEF 
dinner was ready for the next election struggle, knowing these students will be 
older -- ready to vote -- and wiser. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Thursday night dinner in Century City, I caught up by telephone 
with Torres, who was in the midst of pondering his future and cleaning out his 
state Senate office in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, a veteran of the '60s struggles, said Latinos can overcome 
disappointments like his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't give up," he said. "There's too much as stake for future generations. 
Edmund Burke once said that the only way evil triumphs is when good people do 
nothing. This is a very critical time for Latinos."

MANNERS; SHOELESS SALESMAN LANDS ON HIS FEET

 Diana Wong, a Chinese American, and her husband, Paul, born in Hong Kong, have 
three children. One afternoon, insurance salesman Mark Roberts arrives at their 
home to discuss the children's college fund. 
</P>
<P>
 As he approaches the front door, he sees several pairs of tennis shoes on the 
porch. Being sensitive to cultural differences, he removes his shoes. Once 
inside, he notices that Diana Wong is wearing running shoes while he is in his 
socks. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts is confused as is Diana Wong. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 When he saw the sneakers on the front porch, Roberts assumed that in this 
Chinese household they removed their shoes before entering. This was not true. 
It just happened that Diana Wong had washed her children's tennis shoes that 
morning and placed them on the front porch to dry in the sun.  
</P>
<P>
 It is impossible to know everyone's customs. People from many different 
cultures -- Koreans, Japanese, Cambodians, Chinese and Iranians -- may remove 
their shoes before entering a house. Roberts erred on the side of caution, 
trying to show respect to someone different from himself. Fortunately, both 
parties could talk about the misunderstanding and have a good laugh. Roberts' 
sense of humor got him through the incident. However, sometimes in awkward 
moments like this, no laugh can salvage the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: Despite good intentions, cultural blunders happen.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
ARROYO SECO: WHOSE NEEDS FOR SPACE COME FIRST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Theodore Roosevelt, a lover of parks, said on a visit to Pasadena's 
Arroyo Seco in 1911 that it would make one of the world's greatest parks. 
Although reality fell short of that prediction, the narrow arroyo in western 
Pasadena encompasses formal and informal parkland, a winding riverbed lined 
with oaks and sycamores, and developed recreational areas, including the Rose 
Bowl. On a given day, there can be golfers, racing and mountain bikers, 
equestrians, hikers, joggers, soccer players, kite fliers, babies in strollers, 
archers, swimmers, football fans or concert-goers, roller-bladers, children on 
nature hikes and fly-casting enthusiasts practicing on an artificial pond. With 
all these needs, potential conflicts abound over land use, safety and 
environmental concerns have arisen in parts of the arroyo that are being 
rehabilitated and converted for expanded public use. Through community meetings 
and workshops, Pasadena is looking to find a common vision for this open space. 
THE ARROYO 
</P>
<P>
 Slightly larger than New York City's Central Park and overlooked by historic 
and ringed by impressive houses, the Arroyo Seco stretches across 950 acres 
from the Angeles National Forest to South Pasadena. Among the issues are: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Pasadena's newly-formed Hahamongna Watershed Park committee is considering 
how to reshape 250 acres, north of Devil's Gate Dam, shown on map, from which 
tons of silt are being removed. The area includes a section of underground 
pollution that was declared a Superfund site by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency years ago due to chemicals and solvents discarded there, 
probably in the 1940s and '50s by missile system developers. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Browning-Ferris Industries, a waste disposal company, has launched a 
controversial project to plant native trees to make up for damage from the 
firm's dumping operations 20 miles to the west near Granada Hills. Among the 
concerns are whether water from the arroyo should be diverted into artificial 
streams to water the trees and if so, how the diversion should be done. 
</P>
<P>
 3. A debate is simmering about whether to remove a concrete flood control 
channel installed in the 1930s and now considered by some water experts as an 
unneeded barrier to natural habitat restoration. BICYCLIST 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Crowley, member of the Pasadena Bicycle Advisory Committee  
</P>
<P>
 There are horse people who believe the arroyo is their sole domain. I've owned 
a horse but I see the arroyo as an educational center for bikers -- teaching 
kids how to ride and share the trails with other users, including horses. There 
is a compromise possible: Give the bicycles the east side and the horse people 
the west side. EQUESTRIAN 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Specht, activist for the rights of horse riders and a former manager of 
a South Pasadena stable 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a fourth-generation resident of Linda Vista on the arroyo's west side in 
Pasadena. Hoof, foot and paws -- that's our issue. We want to keep the arroyo 
that way. I want to keep mountain bikes off the trails. We only have this area 
to ride in. Bikers have so many other areas. ENVIRONMENTALIST 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Brick, Pasadena's representative to the board of the Metropolitan Water 
District and head of the nonprofit Arroyo Seco Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In the purest sense, the arroyo's not wilderness. But it has wonderful 
wilderness values in an urban setting. It can be a model of how Southern 
California can better treasure its water and natural resources -- a model 
significant for the L.A. River and many other streams and open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to develop harmony with nature and among the arroyo users, so we can 
all share it. ARCHER  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jenkins, treasurer of Pasadena Roving Archers 
</P>
<P>
 One thing we're concerned about is safety on the range. We've got gangs that 
regularly show up when no one is around. They'll tag our signs, our target 
bales. And we're worried about the latest craze, these pistol crossbows they 
bring. We have the police patrol that comes through on horseback but it's not 
always present. TO GET INVOLVED

Recreation Commission at (818) 405-4306.

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: A LAWYERLY FIGHT OVER BRIEFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the family of the late actor James Dean, Korean comedian and businessman 
Buyng Jin Joo is something of a rebel without a clause. 
</P>
<P>
 What representatives of Dean's family claim Joo lacks is any kind of written 
agreement authorizing the maverick businessman to sell his "James Dean" brand 
underwear in Korea through a chain of "James Dean" stores. 
</P>
<P>
 So Curtis Management Group, a company that represents a number of families and 
estates of dead Hollywood stars, filed an unfair competition lawsuit in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 It also filed an action with the Korean agency handling trademark disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Joo responded earlier this month with an ad in a Korean newspaper saying his 
company "could not help but laugh at such a request" when Curtis demanded 
royalty fees. He also argued that the company is authorized to use the 
trademark. Switch Hitting? 
</P>
<P>
 Has Mickey Mantle been striking out or hitting them over the fence in the 
sports memorabilia business? 
</P>
<P>
 The Hall of Fame baseball star recently sued memorabilia firm Upper Deck Co., 
claiming that the company is trying to lower its payments to him. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Yankee great says Carlsbad-based Upper Deck is refusing to abide by 
his 1992 contract with the firm because company officials believe Mantle's 
marketability diminished when he went through alcohol rehabilitation earlier 
this year and publicly admitted his problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Upper Deck and a telephone card company two weeks ago sent out a 
joint announcement boasting that Mantle "set another all-time record" when a 
set of prepaid telephone calling cards featuring Mantle and his career 
highlights sold out in just 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The cards, the hyperbolic announcement said, "sold out in unprecedented time!" 
A Bill To Never Forget 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment industry's Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers 
public affairs coalition recently put out an analysis of its legislative 
victories, including one rather unusual one. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was Assembly Bill 1000, which was opposed by the industry and didn't 
get very far in the Legislature. At issue was "elephant chaining." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would have made it a misdemeanor to chain an elephant for more than 
two hours during a 24-hour period. The coalition argued that Department of Fish 
and Game officials believe it is safe and humane to restrain elephants longer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the alliance, it opposed the bill because "chaining elephants is 
necessary while filming on location, and in the winter when elephants must be 
confined to a barn to protect them from cold weather." Briefly. . . 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study for the Audit Bureau of Circulations said 51.8% of Americans 
surveyed have never heard the term "information superhighway" despite all the 
hype. . .Where are they now?: Robert Allen, one of the leading get-rich-quick 
real estate promoters in the 1980s, is helping pitch a fitness product called 
"Gym in a Can."

CLASH OF THE TITANS: 10 DAYS IN THE MUSIC WARS; POP MUSIC: THE WARNER MUSIC 
GROUP DISPUTE BETWEEN ROBERT J. MORGADO AND DOUG MORRIS THREATENED TO TEAR 
APART A LUCRATIVE, SUCCESSFUL OPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ahmet Ertegun, the legendary co-founder of Atlantic Records, leaves his 
Manhattan brownstone most weekdays just before noon for the 10-minute ride to 
his office at Time Warner headquarters in Rockefeller Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Ertegun -- whose signings over the last 47 years range from Aretha Franklin to 
Led Zeppelin -- had a different destination in mind, however, when he slipped 
into the back seat of his chauffeured Mercedes sedan on the last Thursday in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 The goateed record titan directed his driver to an apartment building 
overlooking Central Park West, where seven colleagues, all top executives in 
the Warner Music Group, were secretly meeting. With clouds gathering over 
Manhattan, they paced anxiously -- each grasping a cellular phone -- awaiting 
the outcome of a showdown at Rockefeller Plaza between their boss, Doug Morris, 
and his boss, Warner Music Group Chairman Robert J. Morgado.  
</P>
<P>
 The faceoff, which had all the earmarks of an old Western shootout, was for 
control of the domestic division of the $5.4-billion Warner Music Group -- a 
Time Warner subsidiary whose chief assets include the Warner Bros., Elektra and 
Atlantic labels. 
</P>
<P>
 The executives in the apartment, all Morris allies, were prepared for an 
unprecedented palace revolt that could paralyze the world's largest record 
company. They were ready to sacrifice their jobs in what would have been the 
most dramatic exodus ever in the record business. Already, top-selling Warner 
artists such as R.E.M. and Neil Young were threatening to jump ship over the 
turmoil. The rebellion had even forced the involvement of Gerald Levin, 
chairman of a massive empire that includes Time magazine and the Warner Bros. 
movie studio. 
</P>
<P>
 For three tense hours, Ertegun huddled with the team that recently had been 
established to guide the company into the 21st Century -- a firm whose artists, 
from Jimi Hendrix and the Doors to Madonna and Prince, have helped shape global 
pop culture for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 To those in the budding insurrection, Morgado and Morris represented vastly 
different agendas. Morgado symbolized a new breed of boss -- a "corporate suit" 
brought in to impose strict business practices in an industry where success 
depends on creative instinct. A former chief of staff to New York Gov. Hugh L. 
Carey, Morgado, 51, has been described by colleagues during his 10-year tenure 
at Warner Music as a brilliant but insensitive strategist. Morris, 54, was a 
music man -- an industry veteran and former songwriter who had been trained at 
Ertegun's side over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle was being closely monitored at rival companies, where executives 
also were concerned about increasing corporate encroachment and their ability, 
if any, to fight it. At the same time, these competitors were practically 
salivating at the prospect of Warner Music crumbling apart. 
</P>
<P>
 After an anxious morning in the Central Park apartment, Ertegun and company 
returned to their offices at Rockefeller Plaza. Shortly before nightfall, they 
learned that the music men had won: Morgado had caved in. Morris had full 
autonomy to run the labels. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't the first time in the history of the music business that 
executives have argued in the back room," the 71-year-old Ertegun said last 
week. "In moments of emotional outburst, people can say all kinds of silly 
things to each other that they wish they hadn't said afterward. The important 
thing is that the music division is now united and moving forward." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days that followed, other Warner executives attempted to publicly 
downplay the incident. Morgado even joked about it in a speech to an industry 
gathering in Santa Monica, saying press accounts of the Warner tumult made 
"Bosnia look like Shangri-La." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, however, nearly a dozen senior Warner executives recounted the 10 
days in which Warner Music came perilously close to imploding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To the average fan, nothing matters but the music -- the next album by their 
favorite artists. But the record industry, which was pioneered by free-spirited 
individuals who followed their instincts and passions, has become a corporate 
battlefield where all that matters is power. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Morgado exercised his power in July, infuriating top officials by 
promoting Doug Morris, formerly head of the Atlantic Group, to run Warner's 
American music division. Rather than report to Morris, who some viewed as 
Morgado's pawn, two legendary industry figures stepped down -- Mo Ostin, 
chairman of Warner Bros. Records, and Robert Krasnow, chief of Elektra 
Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 But in August, Morgado began alienating Morris when -- without consulting his 
top lieutenant -- he threatened to send cease-and-desist notices to executives 
at several competing record companies demanding that they stop approaching 
Warner-affiliated Interscope Records with buyout offers. Morris, who brought 
the hugely successful label and its artists -- including Nine Inch Nails, Dr. 
Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg -- into the Warner fold, feared the move might incense 
Interscope founders Ted Field and Jimmy Iovine so much that they would break 
ties with Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, Metallica, the wildly popular hard rock band, publicly blamed 
Morgado's "greedy and arrogant" behavior as the reason it filed a lawsuit to 
sever its decade-long association with the Elektra label. At issue in the 
still-pending suit: Morgado's alleged refusal to honor a revised deal made by 
Krasnow. 
</P>
<P>
 While these incidents added to Morris' suspicions about Morgado's reluctance 
to share power, his fears came true in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 The pivotal episode occurred not in the offices of Time Warner's music 
division, but in the company's publishing wing, where Entertainment Weekly was 
preparing its annual list of the 101 most powerful figures in the entertainment 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Oct. 18, the day before the issue was to be printed, editors had decided 
that Morris would share a spot with Morgado at No. 19. Morris' photo, however, 
was deleted after a top Morgado assistant called the publication's managing 
editor and objected, arguing that displaying the two executives side by side 
was "inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Following additional complaints from Morgado's assistant, all references to 
Morris were altogether excised around midnight -- minutes before deadline. 
Inadvertently alerted about the last-minute change by a magazine researcher's 
phone call, Morris' office contacted Entertainment Weekly seeking an 
explanation. They were told to call Morgado's office, but were unable to make 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment Weekly managing editor James Seymour denies any impropriety, but 
admits that he erred by not including Morris somewhere on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are seizing upon a stupid mistake as evidence that some grand design 
of dark forces was at work," Seymour said, "but that simply was not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 One name that remained on the list at No. 59 was Lenny Warnoker, who had been 
offered Ostin's job -- the chairmanship of the Warner Bros. label. But Warnoker 
was having second thoughts because he was unhappy with the direction the label 
was going, leading to another clash at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris was angered when he learned that Morgado had put in a pep-talk phone 
call to Warnoker without prior consultation. Warner Bros. Records was supposed 
to be Morris' domain, and he saw Morgado's call as yet another violation of his 
recently bestowed autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Warnoker wasn't swayed by Morgado and announced on Oct. 24 that he would not 
take the new job. (He is likely to leave the company before his contract 
expires at the end of 1995.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a war going on," one senior Warner executive said. "The corporate 
boss was pitting each company chief against the other. It got to the point 
where everybody was suspicious that somebody else was going to stab them in the 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, Oct. 26, Morgado made a presentation to Wall Street analysts, 
which many on the Morris team saw as a humiliating slap. They felt Morgado took 
credit for their contributions and downplayed the U.S. division's value in the 
company's international growth. Ironically, the speech came when company acts 
-- Snoop Doggy Dogg, R.E.M., Green Day and Eric Clapton -- dominated the 
national Top 10. Overall, the Warner Music Group controls more than one-fifth 
of the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
 By that afternoon, the conflict was spiraling out of control. Time Warner 
Chairman Gerald Levin met with Morris and Morgado at 4 p.m. to try to restore 
order -- and to define Morris' power. Though three months had passed since 
Morgado had elevated Morris to run Warner Music U.S., the contract remained 
unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris hoped Levin would mediate the dispute, but the Time Warner chief left 
the meeting after just five minutes, telling the two men to work it out 
themselves. As soon as Levin departed Morgado's office, an angry shouting match 
ensued, with Morgado refusing to budge. 
</P>
<P>
 Around 10 p.m. that night, Morgado called Morris at home and threatened to 
strip away his new title and demote him to his former job as head of the 
Atlantic Group. 
</P>
<P>
 About two hours later, Morgado called Morris again to inform him that he had 
just appointed Warner Music U.K. chief Rob Dickins to replace Warnoker as head 
of Warner Bros. Records in Burbank. The move infuriated Morris, but Dickins was 
already on a plane to New York to sign his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Oct. 27, instead of reporting to Rockefeller Plaza, Ertegun 
and his colleagues secretly gathered in the Central Park apartment of Stuart 
Hersch, who runs Atlantic's video division. Present were Atlantic executives 
Danny Goldberg, Mel Lewinter, Val Azzoli, Ina Lee Meibach and Jason Flom, plus 
Sylvia Rhone, the recently installed Elektra Entertainment chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tension in the room that morning was outrageous," said one insider. 
"Everybody felt betrayed and angry and nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris had intended to meet his allies at Hersch's apartment, but moments 
before leaving home he was summoned to a 10 a.m. meeting with Morgado. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the night before, the two-hour session in Morgado's office proceeded 
calmly, with Morris outlining a plan for better working relations. His primary 
request: the autonomy to deal with artists and executives. But Morris walked 
out of the closed-door session empty-handed and headed for Hersch's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Morris arrived, just past noon, he figured Morgado had already 
announced Dickins' appointment. The mood in the apartment was somber. Many of 
the participants wondered if they had any future at Time Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 Ertegun called Morgado to express concern. But unknown to them, more powerful 
forces were at work. Members of the Time Warner board of directors, anxious 
about the impact of the controversy on the company's image, called chairman 
Levin to complain. In a crucial phone call, Levin re-entered the fray. Sources 
believe he urged Morgado to resolve the matter immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, Morgado called Morris' office, requesting another meeting. 
Morris' team followed him back to Rockefeller Plaza to await their fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris and Ertegun entered Morgado's office around 2 p.m. Over the next three 
hours, Morgado acquiesced to nearly every request as the three men sketched out 
the exact parameters of Morris' power -- including a new title: chairman and 
chief executive of Warner Music U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, Morris still reports to Morgado, but he has been given 
autonomy to run the North American companies. During the meeting, Morris told 
Morgado that he wanted to appoint his trusted confidant Danny Goldberg, rather 
than Dickins, to head Warner Bros. Records. Morgado agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 An embarrassed Dickins, who had already told several industry figures that he 
had the job, returned home to London. 
</P>
<P>
 The day ended in Morris' office with a champagne toast between Morgado, 
Morris, Goldberg, Lewinter and Rhone -- joined by Levin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was smiling and hugging and making up," said one executive. "But 
it's a different ballgame than it was before the battle broke out. Morgado is a 
powerful man and he's not likely to soon forgive or forget. He's been defanged, 
but not de-clawed." 
</P>
<P>
 No one expects the scars to heal soon. "The lesson in all of this is that 
there's more to a music company than the profits it generates," suggested one 
executive. "It involves people. It's the people that count."

TV TALK SHOWS DUKE IT OUT OVER RATINGS; TELEVISION: WINFREY IS STILL NO. 1, BUT 
RICKI LAKE LEAPFROGS OVER A HOST OF LONGTIME FAVORITES TO TAKE THE NO. 2 SPOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not quite as scintillating as "I slept with your man -- please forgive 
me," a recent topic on "The Ricki Lake Show." But it is an attention grabber in 
the world of TV syndication: Facing a glut of competitors on the one hand and 
the teens-talk-trash-and-love-it appeal of Lake's series on the other, Oprah 
Winfrey, Sally Jessy Raphael, Phil Donahue and Geraldo Rivera are experiencing 
a decline in the ratings of their daytime talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Winfrey's series, daytime's long-reigning No. 1 talk fest, is still way ahead 
of the pack, with an average rating of 8.5 this fall. But that's a decline of 
13% from the same period a year ago, through Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Raphael, meanwhile, is down 20%, to a 4 rating; Donahue, at 3.4, is off 29%, 
and Rivera, with a 3.1, is 18% lower than a year ago. (Each Nielsen rating 
point represents 954,000 households.) 
</P>
<P>
 Lake, in her second season, has leapfrogged over the competition, more than 
doubling her rating (from a 2 to a 4.9) to become the No. 2-rated talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for the Donahue and Raphael programs cited the proliferation of talk 
shows as the reason for their loss of audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started out as the executive producer on Sally's show, there were a 
handful of shows with large ratings," said Burt Dubrow, an executive with 
Multimedia Entertainment. "Today, you have many more shows and there is more 
competition among them." 
</P>
<P>
 In Winfrey's case, however, some station managers say there may be another 
factor: Her decision this fall to move in what she described as a more positive 
direction, forgoing shows about victims and people with abnormal relationships 
in favor of topics such as fulfilling your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real double-edged sword," said John Garwood, general manager of 
WPLG-TV in Miami, which, like many ABC affiliates, uses "The Oprah Winfrey 
Show" as a powerful lead-in for local news and ABC's "World News Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oprah is a great creative force in talk shows, and she may be doing exactly 
the right thing to differentiate her show for the future," he said. "But we've 
been spoiled by her ratings. I was amazed that a show she did recently on 
practical jokes got a strong rating. But some of the topics -- such as past 
lives and one-on-one conversations with authors -- didn't perform nearly as 
well. Any time you change your show, you lose viewers. The question is whether 
what she is trying to do will succeed long-term." 
</P>
<P>
 What troubles Garwood and other stations is that, in most cases, they are 
locked into multiyear contracts for "Oprah Winfrey." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's still making a ton of money on Oprah," said one station manager, 
"but stations have paid a premium for the show, and they could be sitting here 
with expensive long-term licenses if her ratings were to drop precipitously." 
</P>
<P>
 While some other talk shows are holding up -- Maury Povich's ratings have 
climbed 5% above last season, for example, and "The Gordon Elliot Show" has 
gotten off to a decent start (unlike the Marilu Henner and Suzanne Somers 
efforts) -- it is Lake's show that has riveted the industry's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake, the former star of the cult movie "Hairspray," is cutting into the 
younger demographics of Winfrey and other talk shows while also attracting some 
people who hadn't been talk-show fans. She is appealing to young viewers with 
an in-your-face format in which the studio audience "votes" on guests and young 
people sometimes confront parental figures. Recent topics have included younger 
women who date older men, romance with prison inmates and cosmetics make-overs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before Ricki Lake, the conventional wisdom was that younger viewers weren't 
big viewers of daytime talk shows," said Jack Fentress, vice president of Petry 
Television, a firm that sells national advertising time on local TV stations.  
</P>
<P>
 That will change next season. Syndicators are trying to drum up interest in 
talk shows hosted by Carnie Wilson of the Wilson Philips music group; Melissa 
Rivers, daughter of Joan Rivers, and ex-"Cosby Show" kid Tempest Bledsoe. 
</P>
<P>
 Fentress cautioned against overstating Winfrey's ratings drop. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's still getting twice the rating of her nearest competitor, stations are 
making a ton of money with her show, and it looks like her ratings are coming 
up a bit during the November sweeps," he said. "And you can't underestimate the 
impact of the proliferation of talk shows on many of the show's ratings. There 
are 22 daytime talk shows on the air -- many more than in the past. Everybody 
and his brother has a talk show, and the pie is being cut up into smaller 
pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Winfrey and her producers believe her current strategy will work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're behind what she's doing," said Moira Farrell, the vice president in 
charge of marketing for King World, which distributes the show. "Our focus 
groups are telling us that viewers like what she's doing." 
</P>
<P>
 During the first week of the November sweeps, Winfrey had a 10.0 rating in the 
top urban markets with programs that included a town meeting on the murder of 
two children in South Carolina and a confrontation with Tom Cruise over the 
violence in "Interview With the Vampire." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still doing topical shows," said Tim Bennett, president of Winfrey's 
production company. "We're just not doing topics like prostitution as a way to 
pay college tuition, a recent topic on one of our competitors." 
</P>
<P>
 To combat any unhappiness among stations, sources say, King World is 
considering offering stations a "double run" of the show -- a second, repeat 
showing of each day's installment to run late at night or early in the morning, 
at no additional cost. (Several other shows already offer a "double-run" to 
stations.) 
</P>
<P>
 None of the established shows seems ready to change course. At "Sally Jessy 
Raphael," producer Dubrow acknowledges "concern" about "Ricki Lake's" jump in 
the ratings but says it would be a mistake for Raphael or other hosts to 
alienate their own audiences by chasing Lake's young viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Sally is the best at the softer, emotional interviews, and we need to 
stay with what she does best and what her audience comes to her for," Dubrow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, despite the ratings declines, producers are still working to develop more 
talk shows. The economics of production costs versus the possibility of hitting 
a gold mine still make it a good gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tougher market today," Fentress said. "But, with the potential return, 
there are a lot of companies out there willing to risk money to see if they can 
get a talk show that flies."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: MEDIUM-HOT WALK ON THE FAR 'SIDE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talking to the dead. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 At 8 a.m. last Wednesday, I rang the doorbell at the West Hollywood residence 
of James Van Praagh, 36, the spiritualist medium I anticipated exposing as a 
fraud after seeing him several times on "The Other Side," a new NBC daytime 
program that explores "out-of-the-ordinary experiences of everyday people." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet I was curious, having no previous experience communicating with the dead 
myself, unless you count the calls I get from some of the people commenting on 
my column. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Praagh's intermittent appearances are the main sizzle in "The Other Side." 
The man is spectacular. Even while thinking that he was nothing more than a 
slick showman, I felt my skepticism softening as he appeared to converse with 
the dead on TV, relaying information from the spiritual world that the show's 
host, Will Miller, insisted Van Praagh had no previous knowledge about. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his most memorable chats with a dead man, Van Praagh confirmed a 
widow's suspicion that her husband had been murdered by strangers and had not 
taken his own life, as the police had claimed. Van Praagh even correctly 
identified the location of the wound. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The people for whom he contacts the dead appear convinced. What makes Van 
Praagh especially persuasive is that these people appear credible themselves. 
These are not people who see a UFO behind every cloud or believe everything 
mailed to them by Publisher's Clearinghouse brings them the house on the hill. 
These are intelligent, thoughtful, sophisticated people. 
</P>
<P>
 People like me. 
</P>
<P>
 Could Van Praagh be on the level? I wanted to believe he was. In case he 
wasn't, though, I brought along my weapons of ridicule -- a notebook, a pen and 
a tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 When the door opened, I was greeted warmly by a smiling man whom I had never 
met. "You look just like I thought you'd look," Van Praagh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, sure, like I was really going to fall for that . 
</P>
<P>
 Van Praagh's place was sparsely furnished, the walls nearly bare. No ghostly 
artifacts or other weird stuff. They were probably still packed away. He'd 
moved in just two days ago. "Come back in a month and I'll have some ghouls for 
you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-mocking medium. I liked that. 
</P>
<P>
 Reared a Catholic, Van Praagh says that when it comes to the dead, he's 
clairsentient (feeling their presence and hearing their thoughts) and, to some 
extent, clairvoyant (able to see them). He believes the spiritual world is 
directly above ours. He says his first contact with a spirit came when he was 
8, when he saw a hand materialize in his bedroom. He has been giving readings 
for a number of years, full time for four. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes spirits will show me visions of things," he said. "I get these 
slides, like film in my face, very, very fast." 
</P>
<P>
 I told him I was skeptical but open to the possibility that he was legitimate, 
and wanted to test him by having him contact my stepfather, Getz Magady, to 
whom I was very close. (I didn't tell Van Praagh my stepfather's name, however, 
or that he had died in 1988, or any other details about him or my family.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I can try," Van Praagh said. "He has to have a strong need of being in 
contact. Mediumship is not something you can always guarantee." You can, 
though, when he does it on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we began on my stepfather, I asked Van Praagh if he could contact 
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman to find out who had murdered them, 
just as he had chatted on TV with the murder victim who had been ruled a 
suicide. "I could do that," he said. "But I would need a family member around, 
because I link in with the relatives. You need a link." 
</P>
<P>
 I was the link for my stepfather. Eyes closed, body still, Van Praagh began by 
praying ("Dear spirit friends, draw close to me . . . "). 
</P>
<P>
 "The man you want to talk to is here," he said a little later. 
</P>
<P>
 During our 55 minutes together, Van Praagh at times spoke directly to Getz ("I 
understand that . . . Gotcha . . . Right. I understand. Thank you very much"), 
told me at one point that Getz was "laughing his head off" and, as a bonus, 
contacted my natural father, Sherman Rosenberg, who died a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Praagh has a talent for drawing tiny bits of information from you during a 
reading and embellishing them in ways that might make you think he received 
them independently from the dead person he says he's contacting. In fits and 
jerks, he relays incomplete thoughts and feelings he claims are coming from the 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 At times he was either getting a lot of erroneous information or 
misinterpreting what he was hearing. No, I didn't have a sister, knew nothing 
about Palm Springs, knew nothing about someone wanting to play a round of golf. 
No, Getz was not bland. No, my natural dad was not poor with money. And so on 
and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some of the other information relayed by Van Praagh was the sort 
that anyone could have reasonably deduced without hearing from a spirit. A Rose 
somewhere in my family? A Sam or Samuel? I'm a Jew. Half my relatives are Roses 
and Sams. Van Praagh was also tuning into "something about a lawyer." Sure, my 
brother's a lawyer. But with so many lawyers around, what family doesn't have 
at least one of the suckers? 
</P>
<P>
 Van Praagh also mentioned lots of vague "sort ofs." It was sort of true, for 
example, that we had talked at our house about "movement" and "getting to a 
different place." After her marriage this spring, our daughter is planning to 
relocate to another city. 
</P>
<P>
 The further we went, though, the more startling were the truths from Van 
Praagh. Yes, Getz had problems "in the stomach area." (He died of stomach 
cancer.) Yes, my mother and Getz constantly bickered, and she would "jump down" 
his neck if he said something that irritated her. Yes, my natural dad was a 
"hard man" who "had to be in control all the time." Yes, my wife is busy trying 
to "put something together." (Our daughter's wedding.) Yes, we've all been 
talking about "going to the mountains," if you extend that to the remote hilly 
setting our daughter is considering for her wedding. Yes, Getz always got on me 
for "eating too quickly." Yes, my mother has had a leg problem. Yes, it's the 
result of a fall. Yes, there's someone named "Lilli or something" -- actually 
Lionel -- to whom my mother speaks daily. Yes, I sign my name so fast that it's 
virtually unreadable. Getz would recall that, because he told me about it 
enough times . . .  
</P>
<P>
 And whoa! 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, while relaying stuff from Getz, Van Praagh abruptly said, "I 
want to go to Oregon. I don't know why, but I want to go to Oregon." Just how 
could Van Praagh have known that my daughter's activist fiance had been 
spending lots of time there lobbying for an initiative on the Oregon ballot and 
had called her at 3 a.m. that very day with the news that the initiative had 
passed? 
</P>
<P>
 And whoa again! 
</P>
<P>
 Van Praagh said Getz was telling him something "about clothes or a shirt or 
something. A certain shirt that you wanted done a certain way." That would be 
the shirt whose collar a laundry kept screwing up. The laundry gave it to the 
wrong customer, then misplaced it when it got it back, then did the shirt a 
fourth time, again with a wrinkled collar. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Praagh said Getz wants me to stop bugging my wife about it. I will if Getz 
will stop bugging me. This talking to the dead can be a real pain. 
</P>

 Eye on Oscar: TriStar Pictures will open "Legends of the Fall" in New York and 
Los Angeles on Christmas Day to qualify the film for Academy Award 
consideration, the studio said. TriStar also announced that because of audience 
response to previews, the studio will move up the movie's nationwide release 
date from Feb. 17 to Jan. 13. Based on the Jim Harrison novella, the film 
features Anthony Hopkins as Col. Ludlow, who raises three sons (Brad Pitt, 
Aiden Quinn and Henry Thomas) in the wilds of Montana in the late 1800s and 
follows the family through World War I and into the early 1960s. Directed by Ed 
Zwick, the movie profiles Tristan (Pitt). Julia Ormond plays Susannah, who 
plunges the family into turmoil. Pitt currently stars in the Warner Bros. film 
"Interview With the Vampire."

 There's No Business Like. . . : "Show Business Kills," a novel by "Beaches" 
author Iris Rainer Dart, won't hit stores until February, but Bette Midler, who 
starred in the 1988 film version of "Beaches," has already agreed to star in 
the film version of the upcoming book. The film will be produced by Midler's 
All Girl Productions with partner Bonnie Bruckheimer. The movie traces the 
lives of four over-40 women in Hollywood -- a soap opera star, a studio 
executive, a screenwriter and an actress married to a famous TV star -- who are 
desperate to hang on to their success. TELEVISION

 Latino Viewing Habits: There's a new study out of ad agency BBDO that has 
determined that the favorite prime-time show among Latino viewers who speak 
English as a primary language is "Beverly Hills, 90210." In descending order, 
the other network favorites are "Monday Night Football," "Roseanne," "The

conducted), "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" and "Married . . . With Children." Why is 
this study of interest? Because it is believed to be a first. There is ample 
data provided by A. C. Nielsen Co.'s Hispanic Index, but it tracks the viewing 
habits of Spanish-speaking viewers only.

baseball players? As a spokesman put it, "We recognize that fans haven't had a

"Goldwyn presents" for "Virgin Vision presents" on the prints and advertising 
for the foreign release of the Steven Soderbergh film. The complaining company, 
now called Vision Video Ltd., claimed that Goldwyn made the change after the 
movie won awards at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. Virgin Vision had originally 
hired Goldwyn to find local distributors for the film in foreign markets. QUICK

COUNTERPUNCH LETTER; QUESTIONING PBS 'RIGHTS' REVISIONISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ervin S. Duggan's Counterpunch, "Rosenberg Errs in PBS Criticism" (Nov. 7), 
takes TV critic Howard Rosenberg to task for challenging public television's 
priorities in providing air time for "Quiz Show" while refusing to fund or 
distribute Charlayne Hunter-Gault's acclaimed human rights series "Rights & 
Wrongs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Broadcasting Service determined before we even went into production 
that, according to PBS programming chief Jennifer Lawson's now-infamous 
decision, human rights is an "insufficient organizing principle" for a series. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Duggan has come up with a revised explanation. He asserts that PBS' 
"programming professionals" judged that our series "did not treat the issues of 
human rights as skillfully" as we believed we had. 
</P>
<P>
 This revisionism conflicts with what we were told. Those programming 
professionals displayed a persistent bias against human rights as a subject, 
declaring it programma non grata from the outset. Only after a growing chorus 
of viewers, station heads and politicians -- 10% of the U.S. Congress has 
written Duggan in support of "Rights & Wrongs" -- were joined by respected 
critics such as Rosenberg in ridiculing the PBS stance did Duggan come up with 
his new rationalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously we have a disagreement with Duggan and his programmers. But so do 
many programmers within PBS. Earlier this year, more than 80 PBS stations 
(including KCET Channel 28) carried our series. And the MacArthur Foundation, 
George Soros' Open Society Fund, the Aaron Diamond Foundation and others will 
renew support for a third season.  
</P>
<P>
 We agree that "reasonable people" can disagree about PBS programming 
decisions. But it is unreasonable to invent new reasons for those programming 
decisions after the fact.

SCREENING ROOM: 'DIRIGIBLE': A QUIRKY TALE FROM URUGUAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pablo Dotta's "The Dirigible," Uruguay's first 35mm feature in 30 years, 
screens tonight at 9 in the AFI's eighth Americas Film Festival, which runs 
through Thursday at the Monica 4-Plex. It's a quirky political fable that 
luckily is as engaging as it is elliptical. 
</P>
<P>
 Its point of departure is the highly public suicide by pistol of an Uruguayan 
president of the '30s in the face of a coup d'etat; why, Dotta wonders, didn't 
any of the news photographers on hand capture the actual moment? 
</P>
<P>
 We cut to the present, with the arrival in Montevideo of a ravishingly 
beautiful young woman (Laura Schneider) who claims at a press conference to 
have interviewed a famous Uruguayan writer upon his return from political exile 
but can't prove it because her article has apparently been stolen. Swiftly, she 
and her handsome translator (Marcelo Bouquet) are caught up in a surreal 
adventure, the point of which, it has been suggested, is to comment on 
Uruguay's "lack of a collective national memory." 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of Fernando Lopes' strikingly moody and mysterious "The Edge 
of the Horizon" (Thursday at 6:45 p.m.) a middle-aged pathologist (Claude 
Brasseur) becomes obsessed with the fact that the corpse of a young man, shot 
down at the city's seamy waterfront, resembles his younger self. Gradually, 
he's overcome by tragic memories and a desire to establish the dead man's 
identity. Although Lopes makes clear that he views the past as a snare, he 
keeps us guessing as to whether he has caught us up in a thriller that's 
supernatural, psychological or criminal -- or a combination of all three.

<P>
 Epic Romance: As part of the ongoing "Hello Hong Kong" festival in Santa 
Monica, three films will screen Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at the Monica 
4-Plex. Tony Au's "Au Revoir, Mon Amour" (Tuesday) is a classic Hollywood 
woman's picture of the '40s, a sweeping, thoroughly captivating epic romance 
set in Shanghai during the World War II Japanese Occupation.  
</P>
<P>
 Anita Mui stars as a beautiful nightclub singer in love with a resistance 
fighter (Tony Leung), who re-enters her life after a five-year absence only 
days before Pearl Harbor, but with Shanghai's fall he's forced into hiding, 
setting off bombs to embarrass the Japanese military. Circumstances propel her 
into the arms of a handsome Japanese security official (Hidekazu Akai) who 
adores her. These emotional entanglements unravel amid constant danger and much 
action.  
</P>
<P>
 Au sets off this old-fashioned -- but sure-fire -- heart-tugging escapist fare 
with dynamic visual panache, evoking a shadowy, intrigue-laden Shanghai of its 
fabled, glaorous pst. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dragon Inn" (Wednesday) is Raymond Lee's lively, witty remake of one of 
revered director King Hu's most delightful films, in which Maggie Cheung stars 
as the lusty, earthy proprietress of a bandit hide-out who combats a group of 
the Emperor's eunuchs, poised to grab control of all China.  
</P>
<P>
 "Saviour of the Soul '91" (Thursday) is a surreal, go-for-broke pastiche of 
all the Hong Kong genres that sometimes defies comprehension but is never less 
than entertaining. In a "Blade Runner" future, the Silver Fox (Aaron Kwok), a 
swordsman, seeks to avenge the death of a partner and to win the love of 
another (Anita Mui) through a thicket of bizarre twists and turns.

JAZZ; WARM AND CHATTY WILSON HAS THE ABILITY TO EXPAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy Wilson's concerts have the feeling of a continuing conversation with a 
chatty, if somewhat self-focused, old friend. Her between-songs monologues are 
rich with personal commentary and the kind of subtle allusions that demand a 
common frame of reference and understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, this sense of intimate colloquy can generate all sorts of 
extended implications in Wilson's singing. In her Saturday night performance at 
the Pantages Theatre, for example, a song such as "Guess Who I Saw Today," with 
its now outdated imagery of a betrayed married woman, was placed in a 
completely different context. Wilson's manner, thick with irony, immediately 
contemporized the story, topping it off with the addition of a few pointed 
lines from Cole Porter's "Miss Otis Regrets" (". . . she pulled a gun . . . and 
shot him. . . ."). 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Wilson's set was devoted to material from her current album, "Love, 
Nancy." Among the highlights were a passionate rendering of Bonnie Raitt's 1991 
hit, "I Can't Make You Love Me," and the '70s R&B tune, "Love Won't Let Me 
Wait." She delivered almost every song with the rhythmic clarity and vocal 
excellence that have always been essential to her music.  
</P>
<P>
 If there was a problem with Wilson's approach, it was a too- prevalent 
tendency to emphasize attitude over message. Given the crowd-pleasing impact of 
her persona-stressing techniques -- the microphone-waving gimmickry to alter 
her sound, the yodeling leaps on the ends of lines, the aggressive, no-vibrato 
climactic phrasing -- it may be understandable why Wilson often chooses to work 
at such a superficial, self-oriented level. 
</P>
<P>
 But when she set attitude aside, and dug deeply into the music, Wilson sounded 
like an entirely different singer -- one with the real ability to expand upon 
the grand tradition of Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Carmen McRae. With 35 
years of her own considerable accomplishments, Wilson has every right to do 
things her own way. But it was hard to hear her sing, in those rare, 
emotionally vulnerable, musically gripping moments, and not wonder about how 
much more she may have to offer. 
</P>

MUSIC; GORCHAKOVA, LEIFERKUS: FROM RUSSIA WITH ARIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a bad time, not so long ago, there was an Iron Curtain that brutally 
segregated the world of music. For most impractical purposes, it kept Americans 
off stages in the Soviet Union and, worse for us, kept several generations of 
wonderful artists away from halls harboring the lyric muse in the wicked West. 
</P>
<P>
 All that is changing now, almost literally with a vengeance. Maria Guleghina 
opened the opera season in Costa Mesa as a mediocre Aida. Barseg Tumanyan 
opened the season in Los Angeles as a bland Mephistopheles. James Levine's 
favorite Verdi baritone is Vladimir Chernov. When the Music Center revives 
"Otello" in May, the treacherous title role will be shared by Placido Domingo 
and a relative unknown, Vladimir Bogachov. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest success thus far in a not-too-successful San Francisco Opera 
season has been Prokofiev's "Fiery Angel" in a fanciful production lifted lock, 
stock and demons from what used to be called the Kirov Theater in what used to 
be called Leningrad. The central roles were entrusted to Sergei Leiferkus, a 
baritone whose international career now makes return visits to his native St. 
Petersburg rare, and Galina Gorchakova, a Siberian soprano remembered for her 
steely-robust Madama Butterfly in Los Angeles last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, Leiferkus and Gorchakova came to Ambassador Auditorium in 
Pasadena for a duo-recital devoted to much opera and a little song. Liked him, 
much of the time. Worried about her. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiferkus does not command what one would describe as an exceptionally rich 
and sensual sound. His tone is slender, grainy, even a bit raw. He doesn't 
invoke automatic comparisons with his great bel-canto predecessor, Pavel 
Lisitsian, whose pathetic U.S. career consisted of a single Amonasro at the Met 
in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leiferkus uses the resources at his disposal very cannily. He knows how to 
act with his voice, how to inflect the text with subtle meaning (even in oddly 
accented Italian). He even knows how to project character while standing still. 
</P>
<P>
 He commands a broad range of dynamics and colors, strong lungs, a sense of 
style and a technique that enables him to make much out of not so much. He is, 
in short, a thinker as well as a singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchakova happens to be blessed with superior vocal equipment. Ironically, 
she doesn't use it nearly as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Her big, broad, dark-tinged soprano is a remarkable dramatic instrument. She 
actually can move it around coloratura passages with reasonable flexibility, 
some breathing problems notwithstanding. Her interpretations tend to be as 
stiff as her demeanor, however, and her temperament tends toward placidity. She 
settles for generalities just when the listener most wants specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 More troubling, she seems unable (or unwilling) to sing any high note softly 
-- or even half-softly. Explosions are her forte, and her fortes are certainly 
explosive. Sometimes they are pinched and edgy, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Her climactic assaults might seem imposing in Brunnhilde's battle cry or 
Turandot's demand for blood. They are distinctly grating in Tosca's prayer for 
compassion. Perhaps Gorchakova ought to spend some time listening to recordings 
by her compatriot Galina Vishnevskaya, or, even better, Zinka Milanov. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opera with piano accompaniment seldom sounds wholly authentic, even when the 
pianist at hand is the bold, sympathetic and virtuosic Semyon Skigin. The 
problem is compounded, of course, when the vocal performances are less than 
idiomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, the bona-fide Russian excerpts provided the most 
memorable and most enticing moments on the rather skimpy, oddly balanced 
program. Leiferkus and Gorchakova know what to do with arias from Borodin's 
"Prince Igor," Rimsky-Korsakov's "The Tsar's Bride" and Tchaikovsky's 
"Enchantress," not to mention the wrenching finale of Tchaikovsky's "Yevgeny 
Onegin." The music is in their blood. 
</P>
<P>
 To a lesser degree, one also had to admire Leiferkus' angry quasi-Italianate 
passion as Verdi's Conte di Luna, his unbridled cackle and snarl as Iago and 
his soft long-winded legato as the dying Rodrigo. When the line didn't rise too 
high, one could appreciate Gorchakova's arching, all-purpose yearning as 
Verdi's Leonoras (both "Trovatore" and "Forza"). 
</P>
<P>
 More poignant, however, was the fragile sentiment -- perfectly focused, never 
distorted -- in songs of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. Too bad the agenda 
mustered only four. 
</P>
<P>
 The sole encore, wildly applauded like everything else, was "La ci darem la 
mano" from Mozart's "Don Giovanni." Here Leiferkus turned out to be a 
surprisingly suave seducer and Gorchakova a surprisingly coy victim. The rumor 
that this would be followed by "Bess, You Is My Woman Now" proved sadly 
unfounded.

THEATER; KAREN MORROW MAINTAINS CABARET'S SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She's platinum-headed, she's brassy and there's absolutely no doubt that Karen 
Morrow possesses a "Show Voice," the title of a Billy Barnes song written for 
her, which she performs and proves in her club act "A Month of Mondays" at the 
Cinegrill in Hollywood, Monday nights through Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last week's opening night, the cabaret sound system had not yet adjusted 
to Morrow's high-decibel approach to a song, and at times Cinegrill patrons may 
have felt as if they were stuck between floors on an elevator with Ethel Merman 
in full blast. But aside from lung power, Morrow also possesses a show-biz 
heart of gold, which means she is determined to cheer you up with some Tin Pan 
Alley gusto and, by God, she'll do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's high point is Morrow's telling (and singing) her bio -- the 
story of how a young girl who was sure she was meant to be sophisticated 
survived the indignity of being Catholic and Polish and Midwestern and taught 
by nuns. She found her voice and her calling when Father Schrader, casting 
director extraordinaire, picked her for the comedy lead in "Brigadoon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That story segues into the Barnes song that celebrates Morrow's 
"take-the-stage alone/no microphone" show voice, by the end of which she 
explodes into a madly self-obsessed Mama Rose from "Gypsy" ("For me! For me!") 
and then collects herself ("I'm so sorry!"). 
</P>
<P>
 The singer's ballads serve more as respites from up-tempo land than heartfelt 
outpourings; Morrow's is an external art and she seems never to take her eyes 
off her audience to check what she might be feeling inside. 
</P>
<P>
 She did, though, connect with "And What If We Had Loved Like That?," the 
Maltby-Shire song about a person who, in her great remorse for the passion she 
has failed to give a relationship, finally finds a kind of passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabaret has been transformed in the last few years by the psychological 
realism of Andrea Marcovicci and the honesty of Nancy Lamott, and Morrow seems 
completely uninterested in that kind of singing. She does, however, offer a 
taste of old-time razzle-dazzle. On Broadway, Morrow appeared in such 
non-spectacular musicals of the '60s and '70s as "I'm Solomon" and "The Grass 
Harp." 
</P>
<P>
 Her kind of musical may be becoming an endangered species, but Morrow is one 
of a number of performers dedicated to keeping that spirit alive.

CONTERPUNCH: MAKING SENSE OF CUBAN HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGDIA CHINEA-VARELA, Migdia Chinea-Varela is a Cuban-born 
screenwriter-essayist with an interest in the promotion and accurate portrayal 
of Latin American culture. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A friend invited my husband and me to see "Floating Islands," four new plays 
at the Mark Taper Forum that deal with several generations of a Cuban family 
and the turbulent political backdrop that led to their displacement. With more 
than 30 major characters and a run of about six hours, these plays constitute 
an epic on dislocation, but they are not about just any community that has 
given way to randomness, drift and chaos. In this case, the play deals directly 
with the eventual estrangement of Cubans from their homeland and from each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem in conveying the many complex reasons behind the Cuban 
exile is that little is known about Cubans as an ethnic group. Moreover, Cubans 
have rarely moved on the same wavelength as other ethnic groups, and most 
particularly other Latino groups, making their motivations difficult to 
pigeonhole. As a Cuban American screenwriter, I know this dichotomy well; that 
given the lack of accurate exposure received by Cubans in the media, it 
sometimes becomes much easier to feed the public's formulaic expectations.  
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Italian Americans, African Americans and Jewish Americans have a large 
body of work from which to draw comparison, criticism or praise, that's not the 
case with Cuban Americans -- all we have are old reruns of "I Love Lucy." For 
example, in the Calendar article of Oct. 24, "The Long and Twisted Route to 
'Islands,' " when theater critic Laurie Winer riffs freely on playwright 
Eduardo Machado's motives by saying that "historical events drive much of the 
personal anguish, and those events define the characters more than the author's 
insights. . . ," she delineates what is missing from the play: some 
intellectual lines of argument behind the emotional causes. In that context, it 
would appear plausible how Machado may have unconsciously believed that it was 
incumbent upon him to explain our collective raison d'etre -- our tragedy, as 
well as our comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 But you can't be all things to all people. Cuban history is so mired in 
contradiction that four (make that four hundred ) plays could not explain the 
extent to which political events have shaped our mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree with Winer in that there are many ways in which "Floating Islands" 
could have cut deeper. Some of the play's threads don't have enough edge to 
stave off sentimentality, while some scenes exist simply for shock value or for 
laughs. In some instances, things as simple as body language seemed too 
self-conscious and devoid of the kinds of important Cuban mannerisms that a 
good Cuban director may have been able to detect and correct. But even when 
"Floating Islands" misfires, it rarely fails to communicate a sobering kind of 
pathos and excitement about my people. The truth is that seeing the plight of 
my brethren portrayed on the stage brought a tear to my eye, and a glimmer of 
hope to my heart. 
</P>
<P>
 My congratulations to Machado.

up to its name over the weekend. If Eric Clapton's all-blues show at the Forum 
the previous week was dazzling, it was transcendent on Friday in the first of 
three nights in the cozier confines of the Sunset Strip nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Clapton played virtually the same set as at the Forum, the intimacy of 
the smaller room (with a tables-and-chairs configuration limiting the capacity 
to 675) allowed him and his band to dig deeper into the nuances of the wide 
range of Chicago and Delta blues. Clapton took full advantage of the 
opportunity, especially in his guitar playing, emotionally exploring a 
fretboard vocabulary that may be unrivaled. 
</P>
<P>
 Where he didn't take advantage of the setting was in non-musical 
communication, missing an opportunity to share personal stories about the songs 
and the blues. But then, the smile on his face as he finished the show with a 
frisky, piano-accompanied "Ain't Nobody's Business If I Do" spoke volumes.STEVE

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; BACK-UP SINGERS OUT-FLASH ANDERSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carleen Anderson is part of a new breed of eclectic, feisty female soul 
singer. Like Me'Shell NdegeOcello and Dionne Farris, she has varied influences 
-- rap, jazz, dance, funk and rock -- and tends toward tough, intelligent, 
feminist-leaning statements.Not content with being gospel-riffing retreads, 
these women prefer trail-blazing and experimenting with new, soul-based styles. 
</P>
<P>
 In her late show at LunaPark on Friday, Anderson didn't quite live up to the 
high expectations. She has a deep, dusky voice, some haunting, compelling songs 
(such as "Nervous Breakdown" and "Mama Said," from her debut solo album "True 
Spirit"), as well as a fairly charismatic presence. But this simply wasn't a 
knock-your-socks-off performance.  
</P>
<P>
 One of her problems was her back-up band, Groove Collective. This large 
outfit, which boasts a punchy horn section and plays a jazz-soul-rock style, 
was so good it was often hard to focus on Anderson. The crisp, well-crafted 
instrumentals didn't just enhance Anderson's songs, but thoroughly overwhelmed 
some of them. 
</P>
<P>
 During Groove Collective's funky, foot-stomping opening set, the question was, 
could this band tone down its dazzle when backing up Anderson? The answer: a 
resounding no.DENNIS HUNT

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; SPEED-METAL GWAR STORMS THE PALACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sex and violence are no strangers to hard rock. But nobody approaches the 
special panache of Gwar, whose live act is so tasteless and extreme that none 
of it could possibly be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 For the theatrical speed-metal band from Richmond, Va., the stage is a 
battleground, a boxing ring, a slaughterhouse. At the Palace on Friday, each 
player was costumed as a kind of prehistoric warrior creature, wearing 
foam-rubber masks and exaggerated horns, teeth, genitalia and intestines. It 
was a Dungeons and Dragons fantasy supercharged on testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
 There was music, too, of course, much of it taken from the new "This Toilet 
Earth" album. If many of the songs had a certain sameness about them, that 
seemed fine with the crowd, since the churning thrash chords mainly served as a 
soundtrack for the craziness on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 In round after round inside a mock boxing ring, Gwar members pounded each 
other with oversized hammers and clubs and swords, sending gallons of fake 
blood and other bodily fluids over the swirling mosh pit. The band finally did 
battle with a giant, multi-headed creature, chopping it to pieces and reaching 
a plane far beyond even the fire-breathing, blood-spewing heyday of KISS in the 
'70s. STEVE APPLEFORD

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; VIENNA SYMPHONY STAYS TO THE COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES * Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos will lead the Vienna Symphony in 
music by Brahms, Strauss and Webern today at 8 p.m. at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. The concert is 
sponsored by the Philharmonic S

<TEXT>
<P>
 Performances of Ravel's familiar orchestration of Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an 
Exhibition" can tip the balance toward either composer. Rafael Fruhbeck de 
Burgos leading the Vienna Symphony on Saturday at the Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts favored the Frenchman. 
</P>
<P>
 The conductor emphasized clarity, balance, luxuriant sound and the brilliantly 
conceived scoring, as opposed to expressions of Slavic soul. This emphasis also 
surfaced in music by Mahler and Hans Erich Apostel, also on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were eminently well-delineated but depersonalized pictures. The 
crescendo and falling off in "Bydlo" were seamless, for instance, but the 
Polish oxcart did not bear the weight of ages. The trumpet in "Samuel 
Goldenburg and Schmuyle" articulated its nervous patter perfectly, but the pain 
within the whining never materialized. "The Great Gate at Kiev" reveled in 
orchestral colors, but not in the triumph of the spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 A triumph of the spirit was also what Mahler wanted in his Tenth Symphony, 
which he did not complete. He did, however, finish the Adagio, holographic in 
portraying stages toward accepting death. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, we can do without the swooning and schmaltz, which some conductors stress, 
maybe. But not without the angst, the protest, the alarms, the comfort, the 
little dances back into life before the final quiet acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 Fruhbeck relied mainly on muscular line, clean articulation and accumulated 
architecture for effect. He got it toward the end, as the tempo slowed yet 
again, the massive scoring died down to shimmering strings, the oboe initiated 
recollections of heroism. But a lot of the journey to this point had lacked 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 He had opened the program with another fragment -- Apostel's Passacaglia, the 
only movement of a projected Concerto for Orchestra that the composer lived to 
complete. The four-minute threnody, written according to strict dodecaphonic 
procedures, partakes of affecting Bergian lyricism, however. 
</P>
<P>
 As an encore, Fruhbeck led the spirited Intermezzo from Gimenez's "La Boda de 
Luis Alonso." CHRIS PASLES * Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos will lead the Vienna 
Symphony in music by Brahms, Strauss and Webern today at 8 p.m. at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. The concert 
is sponsored by the Philharmonic Society. $17-$45. (714) 556-2787.

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; ROMERO SALVAGES CHAMBER LITE OUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra is for people who like to listen to 
classical music with their feet up in an easy chair while reading a book. Then 
they fall asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a highly stylized type of playing. The Franz Liszt's sound, under its 
longtime leader and concertmaster Janos Rolla, is polished to a lustrous sheen, 
but is never brilliant or steely, or golden or burnished for that matter. It is 
a distinctly silken sonority, the violins sugary sweet and soft-edged, the 
violas, cellos and bass of this 17-member string ensemble acting as poised 
foundation. Homogeneity is striven for at all costs, and achieved. Pizzicatos 
become puffy satin pillows of sound. 
</P>
<P>
 As heard Saturday in Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center (the group was also scheduled to appear Sunday at UCLA), the 
much-recorded, Budapest-based ensemble, now on its 10th U.S. tour, delivered 
the cushy goods once again. The program offered Dvorak and Tchaikovsky lite as 
a framework, with some easy-listening baroque in the middle. Luckily, guitarist 
Angel Romero was on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 In a show within a snooze, Romero played his own arrangements of the Oboe 
Concerto in C by Alessandro Marcello and the Lute Concerto in D, R. 93, by 
Vivaldi. To both works he brought an effortless virtuosity and projection 
(without amplification), and a vital, engaging musicianship. 
</P>
<P>
 The two slow movements were particularly cherishable, with Romero's fluid use 
of color and articulation, singing phrasing and vibrato, and dead center 
timing. Rolla and orchestra stayed nicely out of his way and showed some spirit 
in the finales. 
</P>
<P>
 In a solo encore, Romero captured every inch of the giddy showmanship in the 
Fantasia from the "Andaluza" Suite by his father, Celedonio Romero. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings, Opus 48, and Dvorak's Serenade for 
Strings, Opus 22, Rolla led well-drilled, emotionally wan performances. Not 
that either of these works plumb the depths of profundity, but Rolla and 
ensemble opted for smooth surfaces throughout. There's an especial effort to 
avoid hard attacks in this orchestra, a refusal to press the bow for intensity. 
The results are obviously what these musicians set out for, but why should we 
find lulling such a lofty goal? TIMOTHY MANGAN

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; SARUKKAI'S SOLO DRAWS IN AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lush beauty and devotional intensity of Indian classical dancer Malavika 
Sarukkai reached a wide U.S. audience last year through the PBS series 
"Dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 In a six-part solo program at Schoenberg Hall on Saturday, Sarukkai again 
seemed an ideal ambassador for the ancient art of Bharata Natyam: a dancer who 
can bring stunning immediacy and naturalness to a dauntingly complex idiom. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Sarukkai's appearance at the India International Dance 
Festival in New Delhi provoked charges of governmental favoritism: accusations 
that she was essentially a technician without expressive distinction and thus 
didn't belong on so prestigious a showcase. Her performance then -- and her 
UCLA program Saturday -- addressed the controversy directly by emphasizing 
emotional values. 
</P>
<P>
 You could argue that Sarukkai's dramatic powers were taxed to the limit when 
depicting the monstrous serpent Kaliya in "Grishma," a narrative about the god 
Krishna. But she gloriously defined the primal yearnings, satisfactions and 
jealousies of womanhood in three central pieces, with "Kettisan Vazhi" 
especially notable for its supremely elegant eroticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Here she periodically became a living sculpture: slightly leaning to the side, 
with eyes closed and one hand close to her cheek while the other reached out as 
if to gather desire from the very air around her. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the confessional intimacy of such moments, she forcefully met 
the technical and rhythmic challenges of the Varnam and Tillana pieces, 
splendidly accompanied by Neela S. Sundaram, Nagarajan Bagyalakshmi, Palghat K. 
Ranganathan and Natarajan Sigamani. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarukkai's most remarkable achievement, however, might have been her ability 
to obey the rules of Bharata Natyam yet bring non-specialist viewers close to 
its heartbeat by making every moment seem personal, spontaneous and even 
contemporary. LEWIS SEGAL

SHOP TALK: EACH WORKER HAS THE RIGHT TO INSPECT PERSONNEL FILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By Do you have a question about an on-the-job situation? If so, please mail it 
to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Or

 Question: I have a question about having access to my employee records. I 
asked my supervisor to look at my personnel file. At first she said that she 
could not let me review it, but that she could read it to me. Then she told me 
I had to go to our Personnel Department to look at it, which is at a separate 
location from where I work. My manager admits that she has a separate employee 
file on me but was reluctant to show me. What are my rights to see all my 
employee files? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.D., Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: You have a statutory right to inspect your employee personnel file 
during reasonable business hours. You have a right to obtain a copy of any 
document that you have signed. You also are entitled to review other files 
which have been used to determine the conditions of your employment. Very 
often, an employer may keep a separate file other than your own file with other 
relevant documents in it. These are subject to your inspection as well. There 
have been cases of restricted access to supervisors' notes, however. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the statutory rights, you might have a contractual right to a 
review of your file depending upon the promises of your employer, especially in 
the employee handbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you cannot keep copies of it, consider taking notes of the relevant 
documents in the file, taking a picture of it with your own camera or dictating 
the contents of your file into your tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Try to ask for it, without any previous notice. The employer may allow you to 
see it without first reviewing it. Too much advance notice might allow them to 
"sanitize" the file to your detriment. 
</P>
<P>
 If they refuse you immediate access to your file, confirm your request in 
writing. This will help you later if they refuse your request. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with asking for access to your file if you are still employed is 
that the employer might look at you suspiciously as trying to "position" 
yourself against the employer. This may hurt you later in more critical 
performance reviews in an effort by your employer to likewise position itself. 
The very act of your confirming your own position by looking at your file might 
actually cause or influence what you are trying to prevent -- job insecurity.

 Question: I'm a state lifeguard who works on a seasonal basis. Sometimes we 
are scheduled to call in, say at 10 a.m. We are told at that time whether we 
need to come in to work. If we do, we get paid. If not, we don't. Is that 
legitimate? 
</P>
<P>
 -- B.H., San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes. California's wage rules provide that an employee must be 
compensated for at least two hours of work if the employee reports for work but 
is not actually put to work. However, merely calling in to work is not 
considered "reporting to work." Instead, the employee must physically appear at 
the employer's work site. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: Please clarify a point from a column a few weeks ago, which said 
that a person on disability may be fired without cause at any time. How does 
the Family Leave Act apply and how does California law apply?  
</P>
<P>
 It was my understanding that people with a legitimate disability could not be 
fired for three months if they work for a company with more than 50 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.L., Brea 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Both the California Family Rights Act and the federal Family and 
Medical Leave Act prohibit retaliation against an employee who takes advantage 
of the 12 weeks of unpaid family leave provided for in those laws. Therefore, 
an employer could not fire an employee because he or she took a family leave. 
</P>
<P>
 However, an employee on leave -- for disability or any other reason -- may 
otherwise be treated just like any other employee. Absent an unlawful motive, 
such as discrimination or retaliation, an employer generally may discharge any 
employee at any time without cause, unless there is an express or implied 
employment agreement that imposes restrictions on that discharge.

 Question: I work for a government contractor. This contractor forces employees 
to charge the government a certain number of "uncompensated overtime" hours 
every year. If any employee did not meet this "quota," the employee would 
receive low and delayed merit increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the employee does not get paid for these hours, the contractor still 
bills our government for these hours. The policy is not published, but it is 
carried out by all levels of management. I would like to find out if this 
action is legal, and if not, what can I do? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.C., Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: This may or may not be illegal, depending on various factors. First, 
you don't indicate whether employees actually work these overtime hours, or 
just charge the government for them without working them. If your company is 
charging the government for hours not worked, it could amount to fraud, which 
would result in substantial civil and criminal penalties for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 If the hours are actually worked, but employees are not paid for them, whether 
this is illegal would depend on whether the employee is "exempt" or 
"non-exempt" under the overtime laws, as well as the terms of your company's 
contract with the government. That contract may allow your company to be 
compensated for overtime worked by management and other "exempt" employees, but 
the labor laws do not require your company to actually pay overtime to exempt 
employees. "Non-exempt" employees who work overtime are entitled to be paid 
overtime; if this is not being paid, your company may be liable for labor law 
violations, as well as government contract fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 You would be protected by the federal False Claims Act and state 
whistle-blower laws against discharge or discrimination in the event your 
employer's conduct was fraudulent and you reported it to the government agency 
with which your company contracts.

NEWS ANALYSIS; ECONOMIC GROWTH MAY SLACK OFF SOON; INFLATION: EXPERTS SAY THE 
3-YEAR EXPANSION IS NEARING ITS PEAK, WHICH COULD HURT BOTH REPUBLICANS AND 
BILL CLINTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The good economic news just keeps coming: inflation remains under control, 
growth is solid and the nation's unemployment rate is at a four-year low. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as the Republicans take control of Congress, empowered by a public 
frustrated over a declining standard of living and government's inability to do 
anything about it, there are signs that the 3-year-old economic expansion is 
nearing its peak. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news for the revitalized GOP: At worst, the nation could go from 
strong growth and low inflation to a world in which consumers have less money 
to spend and are paying double-digit rates on fixed-payment mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, the economy's recent growth rate will likely slacken in the 
next year, economists agree, though output and employment should continue to 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're downshifting from fourth to third gear, and we will be down to second 
gear by next spring," says David Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw Hill in 
Lexington, Mass. The prospect of another recession -- at least before 1997 -- 
is remote, however.  
</P>
<P>
 A slowdown would be more bad news for Bill Clinton, who has tried with little 
success to win credit for the recent economic growth. Instead, the 
Administration may find itself being blamed for economic sluggishness just in 
time for the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
 California is just now coming out of the slump that most of the rest of the 
country began to shed in 1991. "In one sense, that's good, because it means it 
has momentum building up to offset national weakness," Wyss said. "On the other 
hand, it is hard to grow in a slow national economy." 
</P>
<P>
 A forecast released last Thursday by Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona, 
Ariz., sees the nationwide economy slowing to a 2.7% growth rate in 1995 from a 
revised 3.8% rate in 1994 -- the strongest since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Other forecasts vary, but most say that expansion of the U.S. economy will 
slow to between 2.5% and 3% by 1995 from the generally expected range of 3.5% 
to 4% in 1994. And a further slowdown is forecast for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Federal Reserve Board succeeds in keeping a lid on inflation, prices 
should rise between 3% and 3.5% in 1995, a bit faster than 1994 but below a 
feared 5% or more if things get out of hand.  
</P>
<P>
 For now, there are ample signs that the economy is very strong and -- 
notwithstanding Thursday's report of falling wholesale prices -- pressures are 
building for consumer prices to rise: 
</P>
<P>
 * Manufacturers are operating at near the 85% capacity rate, considered the 
point where bottlenecks begin to occur. Several businesses report that raw 
materials are running short and prices are climbing, a sign that suppliers of 
such items have already reached full capacity. (Wholesale prices dropped 0.5% 
in October after a similar drop in September, but most of that was attributable 
to lower new car prices.) Pressure is building on manufacturers to pass on to 
customers the higher costs of materials -- something that has not yet happened 
in most cases. 
</P>
<P>
 * Business investment in areas such as computers and information processing 
equipment has been booming for the last year and is certain to cool, said R. 
Jeffrey Green, professor of business economics at the Indiana University School 
of Business. 
</P>
<P>
 * The nation's unemployment rate dipped to 5.8% in October from 5.9% the month 
before. Hourly wages rose at their fastest pace in 11 years. Economists 
generally consider 6% to be the rate at which the economy is operating at 
so-called full employment, the point at which pressure mounts to hike wage 
rates as labor becomes scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Interest rates continue to climb: the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
reported last week that rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages reached 9.05%, 
their highest levels since 1991. The bond market continues to view the nation's 
strong growth with unease, sending yields on the benchmark 30-year Treasury 
bill above 8%. And economists widely believe that the Federal Reserve Board, in 
an effort to forestall further inflationary pressures, will hike short-term 
interest rates this month by at least 50 basis points, and again in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, signs that an economic slowdown will occur in the months 
ahead also abound. The pace of home-buying has started to slow. Manufacturers 
have been building inventories at a rate that can't be sustained. Retail sales 
were off in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer spending, which also has been running at an unsustainable high rate, 
is sure to slow, particularly since much of the last year's buying binge was 
paid for by refinancing home mortgages. The refinancings have all but dried up, 
and consumers have been incurring new debt. Higher interest rates should dampen 
the heretofore strong demand for durable goods such as autos, furniture and 
appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 For some businesses, a slowdown in the nation's economy is likely to be offset 
by continuing growth in export markets, particularly as Japan and Western 
Europe pull themselves out of their own recessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, export markets will be important to California's continuing recovery, 
particularly as the national economy slows, said Wyss at DRI/McGraw Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 California "benefits more than usual from trade with Mexico, Japan and East 
Asia, and that ought to be a help," he said.

BRINGING PC PROFITS HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS; MANUFACTURERS ARE PULLING OUT THE 
STOPS TO CAPTURE FAST-GROWING FAMILY MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 2 million shoppers will plunk down $2,000 or so apiece this holiday 
season to buy personal computers for their families. Most of them are craving a 
pleasant "out-of-box experience" on Christmas morning: that marvelous feeling 
of unpacking a powerful computer with tons of built-in software, the bells and 
whistles of multimedia and the simplicity of bringing the whole shebang to life 
with the flick of a switch. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer makers such as Compaq, Packard Bell, Apple, IBM and Acer are happy to 
oblige. More than a decade after personal computing began to take off in the 
workplace, the home market has at last become an inviting arena for PC 
manufacturers. And they're pulling out the stops to provide alluring products 
at the right price. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least in the U.S. market, sales are just going to be incredible," said 
Robert Corpuz, a PC analyst with Dataquest Inc., a San Jose research firm. 
"It's a very big opportunity for the top vendors, and they're all well 
positioned to sell into the home market." 
</P>
<P>
 As the personal computer industry gathers in Las Vegas for today's opening of 
Comdex, its biggest trade show of the year, business is looking fine indeed. 
That is despite the bruising price competition and "bundling" of computer 
applications that have depressed profit margins and made both hardware and 
software more like toasters or soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Link Resources, a New York consulting firm, projects that computer hardware 
sales will rise 26% in 1994, to $9.2 billion. Software revenue will increase 
16% this year to $2.9 billion, with multimedia games and "edutainment" 
products, featuring sound and video, soaring a staggering 340% to $590 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounting for much of the PC's popularity is the growing perception by the 
public that computers are becoming useful household appliances. Many machines 
today can be transformed easily into VCRs, CD players, televisions, telephones 
and fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The home PC is, in fact, emerging as a digital chameleon," said Richard 
Zwetchkenbaum, research director for International Data Corp., a research firm 
in Framingham, Mass. Computers "used to flow downstream, from business to 
consumers. Now . . . the consumer is the driving force." 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor propelling the PC's popularity is its wider availability. No 
longer relegated to computer superstores, mail-order catalogues and specialty 
electronics boutiques, PCs have gone mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Computers, printers and software greet shoppers at Costco-Price Club warehouse 
stores right inside the front door. Mass and discount merchants such as Sears, 
Target and Wal-Mart have beefed up their computing departments, as have 
consumer electronics chains such as the Good Guys and Circuit City. 
</P>
<P>
 At Office Depot's 400 stores nationwide, home computers and business machines 
make up 40% of the revenue, up substantially from a few years ago, said 
spokesman Gary Schweikhart. Home office equipment at Circuit City's 279 
consumer electronics stores made up 16% of sales in the first six months this 
year, up from 9% in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the fastest-growing segment of our business," said Paul Rakov, a 
spokesman for the chain, based in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 46% of all computing devices sold today are for the home; most 
complete systems cost between $1,200 and $2,700. Given that more than 
two-thirds of America's 97 million households still don't have personal 
computers, the home represents "the largest untapped market in the world," said 
Michael A. Norris, vice president of consumer products for Compaq Computer 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq, based in Houston, gets much of the credit for starting the boom a 
couple of years ago by offering aggressively priced products for the home. Its 
Presario computers are selling as fast as the company can ship them, Norris 
said, even at the rate of thousands a day. They are now offered in more than 
6,000 stores, up from fewer than 900 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For consumers, the chief problem this holiday is that some popular models 
might be in short supply as the holiday season rolls on, said Jake Winebaum, 
publisher and editor of New York-based FamilyPC, one of several magazines that 
have sprung up in recent years to capitalize on the hot home market. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM, for example, acknowledged recently that it underestimated demand for its 
Aptiva line of multimedia computers for the home, which can respond to voice 
commands. Like other manufacturers, IBM, known primarily in the past as a maker 
of business systems, is heeding the multimedia call and is moving quickly to 
include the capability to play CD-ROMs on all its home offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much at stake, manufacturers are getting bolder about advertising 
their wares. In time for the holidays, Apple Computer Inc. has launched its 
first "infomercial" in San Francisco and Boston. During Thanksgiving week, the 
Cupertino-based company plans a nationwide rollout of the half-hour ad about 
its Performa line of Macintoshes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the buoyant outlooks, Zwetchkenbaum of IDC believes that the industry 
will not reach its full potential for sales growth in the home market unless it 
brings prices down further. For most households to be comfortable making a 
computer purchase, he noted, the price would have to be less than $700. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Macgillivray, a Silicon Valley consultant, agreed. "The more companies 
try to outdo one another," he said, "the more they raise expectations" and risk 
disillusioning home users. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now the industry is forging ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Norris of Compaq: "The home market will be the fuel behind PC growth 
through the decade." PCs: Looking Hot! 
</P>
<P>
 Personal computer makers have finally taken a shine to the home market. 
Analysts predict solid sales growth as customers snap up multimedia computers.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; YESTERDAY'S COMPUTERS A BOON FOR JUNKYARDS; 
TECHNOLOGY: RECYCLING, RESELLING OR REBUILDING THE OUTDATED MACHINES KEEPS 
SCORES OF SMALL FIRMS BUSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Truckloads of aged personal computers, printers and mainframe equipment pile 
up in the parking lot of a scrap yard built on the site of an old Anaheim 
racquetball club. 
</P>
<P>
 Silicon Salvage Inc. work crews wielding electric screwdrivers and power saws 
will soon tear them apart to salvage parts for resale or to be melted down for 
their gold and silver plating. 
</P>
<P>
 Silicon Salvage owner Chuck Hulse describes his operation as a junkyard, but 
it's more of an electronic butcher shop; most of the machines arrive in good 
working order. They are yesterday's models, slower PCs that can't run the 
latest software or refrigerator-sized mainframes that cost too much to 
maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 Recycling, reselling or rebuilding used computers keeps scores of small 
Southern California companies busy, along with several large firms such as 
upgrade specialist Kingston Technology Corp. in Fountain Valley and repair 
giant Cerplex Group in Anaheim. The business is booming because a proliferation 
of faster and more powerful computer programs are making some hardware obsolete 
for their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost track of how many roomfuls of computers I've hauled off," said Hulse, 
who keeps 14 employees and three trucks busy unbolting and unplugging PCs from 
offices across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying in bulk from bigger organizations, such as Lockheed Corp., Southern 
California Gas Co. and UCLA, Hulse said he often gets the oldest PCs for as 
little as $10 apiece if he takes them away. 
</P>
<P>
 With the parts inside computers often selling for more than the machines are 
worth intact, Hulse said, the development of the salvage business was 
"inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's gotten pretty conscious about what's in the computers," Hulse 
said. "It used to be where I'd be going through people's trash, but now I 
wouldn't find much." 
</P>
<P>
 Hulse is near the bottom of a chain of businesses whose work begins when 
computer owners are faced with computer integration, or software problems that 
make getting rid of a machine prudent. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies, such as Irvine-based Taco Bell donate obsolete machines to 
schools or charities. But many used machines will be sold in the resale market, 
valued at about $2 billion year. The buyers are small business owners, parents 
looking for an inexpensive machine for young children and college students. 
Many of the sellers are companies like Irvine pharmaceutical maker Cocensys 
Inc. Fred Anson, Cocensys information systems manager, says he can't wait to 
boot a few machines out his company's door. Anson says he has trouble getting 
the company's nine Apple computers to work with 104 other machines running on 
the IBM-compatible operating system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them out of the building, period. They're too hard to integrate," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 While companies in Cocensys' predicament have taken considerable depreciation 
on the machines, a network of middlemen has sprung up in Southern California to 
find ways to add value to used equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 They range from small parts operators such as Oscar De La Garza -- whose 
four-employee business, Dela Computer Marketing in San Clemente, had revenue of 
about $800,000 last year -- to Aurora Electronics Inc., an Irvine firm formed 
two years ago that did $130 million worth of business in fiscal 1994. Both sell 
parts and components, and work with repair and service companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to stay in the mid-range (computer) market, since the PC parts have 
gotten to be so cheap," said De La Garza. "You could say we're supplying almost 
the same parts that IBM can get you . . . we try to have a faster turnaround, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
 Though far bigger, Aurora Electronics was founded with a similar goal of 
helping users extend the life of their machines, said Bob Allison, Aurora's 
chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go to tell a customer how they should cope with older computers, 
there's really no right answer except there are a lot of ways they can do it. 
That's what makes the business work." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Klein, founder and chief executive of the Cerplex Group Inc., in Anaheim, 
said the used computer market resembles the auto industry, with all shades of 
support services, parts and salvage companies. 
</P>
<P>
 From its founding in 1990, Cerplex has grown to about 1,500 employees 
worldwide -- 450 in Orange County -- and it estimates nearly $130 million in 
revenue this fiscal year, according to Klein. The company has benefited from 
growing demand for computer-repair services from companies that don't want to 
part with older systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing a lot of the same things you'll see auto-parts companies doing," 
he said. "It's taking old hardware back from the field that's either broken or 
out of service, and tearing it apart for parts or reconditioning it as spares."

 Petroleum Industry Meeting: The American Petroleum Institute, the 
Washington-based umbrella trade organization of the U.S. oil and natural gas 
industry, continues its two-day annual meeting today at the Century Plaza Hotel 
in Century City. The meeting, which is being held for the first time in Los 
Angeles, is traditionally attended by the top executives of energy companies 
large and small.In formal panel discussions, executives, analysts and guests, 
including Carol M. Browner, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, will discuss the economic outlook for the petroleum industry. The talk 
in the hallways will undoubtedly be of the implications for the industry of 
last week's elections and the dramatic gains by the Republican Party. Industry 
leaders have been highly critical of environmental and political restrictions 
on exploration in such areas as Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and 
the waters off California. The industry has also been undergoing a painful 
contraction to accommodate the current low oil prices.

 Kmart Will Open Two Superstores: Kmart Corp., the nation's second-largest 
retailer, will introduce its superstore concept this week to a Southern 
California retail market that is increasingly embracing the concept of one-stop 
shopping. The first of the Super Kmart stores in the region will open Sunday in 
Anaheim and La Habra.The stores incorporate a regular Kmart with a full-service 
grocery featuring fresh and gourmet foods. They also include pharmacies, floral 
departments, video rentals and restaurant areas. About 600 full- and part-time 
employees will work at each of the stores, which will be open 24 hours a day. 
Kmart has about 70 superstores nationwide. The first in California opened in 
September in Fresno. The company, which has said it expects to report its 
seventh straight quarterly earnings decline for the third quarter, has been on 
a massive self-improvement program this year to shore up its retailing 
operation, including overhauling store concepts and remodeling.

PLASTIC ISSUERS SEEK EVER MORE CARDHOLDERS; CREDIT CARDS: WITH 40% OF ALL 
CHARGES MADE BETWEEN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, IT'S 'PAYOFF TIME' FOR BANKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is your mailbox crammed with letters from banks offering to sign you up for a 
new credit card? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, you're not special. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit card companies have deluged consumers in recent weeks with hundreds of 
millions of letters asking them to sign up for cards. They want to line up as 
many new customers as possible to cash in on the biggest shopping season of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 With 40% of all credit card charges made during November and December, and 
consumers using their cards a lot more often this year than last, card experts 
say Santa will be very good to issuers this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is payoff time in the bank card business," said Robert B. McKinley, 
president of RAM Research Corp., an independent research company that tracks 
credit card trends. 
</P>
<P>
 RAM data shows a cardholder typically charges at least $500 during the 
holidays. Since many users share an account with spouses, most card balances 
shoot up by $1,000 during November and December. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why consumers have seen their mailboxes stuffed with new offers from 
American Express, Citicorp and other issuers. 
</P>
<P>
 Data on the number of mailings during September and October isn't yet 
available, but experts estimate that consumers got 600 million letters. In the 
first six months of the year alone, credit card issuers sent out 1.2 billion 
pieces of mail, compared to 1.5 billion for all of 1993, according to Robert 
Skolnick, executive vice president at Behavioral Analysis Inc., a Tarrytown, 
N.Y., company that tracks mail solicitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Issuers usually launch new cards in fall and spring ahead of the holiday and 
vacation seasons, but McKinley said this fall companies have been unusually 
busy rolling out new cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven major new cards have been launched nationally in the last three months. 
American Express Co. recently introduced a new gold card with special travel 
rewards. In September, the company launched a new version of its Optima card 
that gives consumers a 25-day grace period on new charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevy Chase Savings Bank rolled out no-fee Rolling Stones Visas and 
MasterCards. Federated Department Stores, which owns Bloomingdale's, launched a 
co-branded Visa card, as did Quaker State Corp. Exxon Corp. launched a 
MasterCard. Even Adolph Coors Co. put its Coors Extra Gold brand name on a 
piece of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Issuers also are offering existing cardholders new products with lower 
interest rates and special rebates. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last few months, Citicorp has sent out solicitations for a Visa that 
carries a 6.9% rate for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 First USA Bank, based in Wilmington, Del., revived an old rebate offer to 
cardholders who transfer a balance from another card. Takers get a credit equal 
to 1% of the transferred balance posted to their account. The offer comes with 
a transfer coupon that looks like a check already made out in the cardholders 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good time to be upping spending limits, sending out checks and 
offering balance consolidation programs," said Donald J. Auriemma, chairman of 
his own Westbury, Conn.-based firm that does consulting for card companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to get the cards into people's hands by Thanksgiving," said 
Auriemma. "Timing is everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Last year, consumers charged $17.9 billion worth of goods from 
retailers on their Visa cards from Thanksgiving through Christmas Eve, a 32% 
increase over the 1992 shopping season, according to Visa. 
</P>
<P>
 This year is already stacking up to be one of the best for card companies in a 
while. Visa and MasterCard charges were up 30% to $170 billion in the first six 
months of the year, according to RAM Research. The number of new cards in 
circulation is up 10% to 320 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong economy, consumer confidence and better deals on credit cards are 
driving the growth, said McKinley.

 However, there's a chance the card companies could get some coal in their 
stockings. Economists are betting that the Fed will raise rates again this 
year, which could drive banks to raise borrowing costs more and cause consumers 
to rein in their spending.

 U.S. Banks Get OK to Open in Vietnam: Vietnam for the first time gave approval 
to U.S. banks to operate in the country, allowing Citibank and Bank of America 
to set up branches in Hanoi. The State Bank of Vietnam, the country's central 
bank, awarded licenses to the banks, the two largest in the United States. Ten 
other foreign banks have approval to open branches, while 20 have permission 
for representative offices, which limit operations to collecting information.

THE PACIFIC; FLUOR CORP. CHAIRMAN LES MCCRAW SEES BUSINESS APLENTY IN ASIA; 
CONSTRUCTION: THE REGION IS EXPECTED TO SPEND $1 BILLION ON INFRASTRUCTURE. 
</P>

<P>
 With developing countries in the Pacific Rim expected to spend $1 billion on 
infrastructure projects through the year 2000, small wonder that Irvine-based 
Fluor Corp. Chairman Les McCraw is playing a role in this year's Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly half of the company's $8 billion now come from Asia and other 
developing regions such as Latin America, Eastern Europe and Africa. Fluor is 
the parent of Fluor Daniel, an engineering and construction company, and A.T. 
Massey, one of the top five coal companies in the states. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going into a period where we think we'll have more business outside 
the U.S. than inside the U.S.," McCraw said during an interview with Bloomberg 
Business News. He also noted that the "Asia-Pacific will represent a 
significant part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor is set to win a major contract to work on power generators as part of a 
$2.6-billion power plant project backed by a multinational consortium led by 
U.S.-based Mission Energy Co., General Electric Corp. and Japan's Mitsui & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary contracts for these so-called Paiton projects were handed out in 
February. However, a second round of contracts is now being awarded by PT 
Paiton Energy Co., the formal name of the group of companies overseeing the 
construction of two coal-powered energy plants in East Java. This area is home 
to about 60% of Indonesia's 185 million people. The four-year project is set to 
get underway early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also plans to announce in the next few days an Indonesian joint 
venture with Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Power and Jakarta-based Catur Yasa Co. 
to operate and maintain power production facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Carano, Fluor Daniel's Asia Pacific group president, said the venture 
will start out by taking over part of the operations of an Irian Jaya, 
Indonesia, mine from Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc., a company based in 
Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture will gradually be expanded to serve a number of power-related 
operations in Indonesia, he said in the interview with Bloomberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Carano stressed that his company is involved in a number of non-power projects 
across the region as well. With 13 offices in Asia, Fluor has been involved in 
projects ranging from automotive facilities in China to consumer goods 
producing plants in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very busy across this whole region and see tremendous business 
opportunity," Carano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor's presence in the region led APEC leaders to select McCraw to co-chair 
the Pacific Business Forum, a consultative group set up following last year's 
APEC meeting in Seattle. The 33 executives representing all of APEC's member 
nations were charged with the task of reporting "on what gets in the way of 
business," McCraw said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's recommendations, compiled in October, will be formally presented 
to APEC heads of state today. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with calling for big picture goals such as an APEC-wide free trade bloc 
by 2010, the report also highlighted particulars like streamlining immigration 
procedures for foreign staff of investor companies. 
</P>
<P>
 McCraw stated that he expects Fluor to be an "indirect" beneficiary of the 
group's efforts.

 China's Trade Surplus Grows: China's trade surplus widened by $1 billion in 
October as exporters were protected from tight credit policies which curbed 
imports.Exports grew 29.6% over the year-earlier month to $10.4 billion while 
imports rose 8.7% to $9.4 billion. In the first 10 months of the year, China's 
exports increased 29.7% to $89.86 billion while imports gained 14.5% to $87.45 
billion. According to official customs figures, that leaves a trade surplus of 
$2.4 billion, contrasted with a $7.1-billion trade deficit by the same time 
last year when the appetite of Chinese factories for imported production 
materials was at its height.

 New Chief for Bank of Japan: Yasuo Matsushita, a former top Finance Ministry 
official, will be the next governor of the Bank of Japan, the ministry 
announced.Matsushita faces difficult tasks, including helping the banking 
sector recover from billions in bad loans and keeping Japan's economic 
expansion on track as many industries undergo painful restructuring. The 
central bank exerts influence over Japan's economy by setting interest rates. 
The current governor, Yasushi Mieno, set off the collapse of Japan's "bubble

DESPITE OPPOSITION, THE FED IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE RATES FOR 6TH TIME THIS 
YEAR; INTEREST: SOME ON WALL STREET SAY A HIKE IS NEEDED TO SLOW THE ECONOMY. 
CRITICS ARGUE THAT IT COULD PUT THE COUNTRY INTO A RECESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board, expected to increase interest rates for a sixth 
time Tuesday, faces growing opposition from critics who contend its policies 
threaten to topple the country into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, there is a widespread belief that the central bank will raise 
interest rates for a sixth time this year when its policy-setting group, the 
Federal Open Market Committee, meets Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "The big surprise would be if they did not," said Mellon Bank Corp. economist 
Richard Berner. Most observers expect the Fed to raise short-term interest 
rates a half point after having raised rates 1.75 percentage points since early 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 Those on Wall Street argue the rate hike is needed to slow the economy -- 
which grew at a 3.4% annual rate last quarter -- to a less inflationary pace.  
</P>
<P>
 "Inflation risks are rising, and we see increasingly clear evidence that price 
pressures are growing in the early stages of the production pipeline," said 
Berner. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent data suggest inflation, while gathering steam in the earlier stages 
of production, is not about to flare up at the consumer level. 
</P>
<P>
 Wholesale prices slid 0.5% in October for a second straight month. Consumer 
prices have risen at a 2.8% annual rate in the first nine months of the year, 
barely exceeding the 2.7% rise in all of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 And the productivity of U.S. businesses rebounded in the third quarter, 
reflecting a pickup in the output of goods, slower growth in work hours and a 
puny rise in labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's inflation-fighting efforts received some words of support Friday 
from Rep. Newt Gingrich, the Republican in line to become House speaker in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said he supported the goal of stable money growth, something long 
espoused by conservative economists known as monetarists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm prepared to argue that part of the long-term change we're going through 
(with the Republican take-over of Congress) ought to be to have a very severe 
effort to move towards a very stable money environment," Gingrich said at an 
investors' conference. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the 1946 law under which the Fed operates should be amended to 
specifically "make stable money a major goal of the Fed and to say that we want 
you, in fact, to have a non-inflationary environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and other inflation hawks on the Fed 
have talked about setting zero-inflation as a Fed goal, but this view has been 
heavily criticized by liberal Democrats in Congress. They accuse Greenspan and 
his colleagues of being overly worried about inflation at the expense of 
economic growth and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich called unwarranted fears that Republican tax-cut promises will 
inflate the deficit and prompt the Fed to raise interest rates much further to 
combat growing inflationary pressures caused by government red ink.  
</P>
<P>
 Fed officials should invite Gingrich and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole to 
meet with them so that the two can explain what a Republican-led Congress will 
do, Gingrich said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fed could "see whether or not we're serious about actually getting to a 
lower deficit."

 Some economists and business executives are arguing that the Federal Reserve 
would be acting too hastily if it increases interest rates Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any more ratcheting up of rates risks overkill," said Lawrence Chimerine, 
chief economist of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based think 
tank funded primarily by corporations and foundations.The institute sponsored a 
meeting this weekend, where these factors were pointed out: 
</P>
<P>
 * Global competition between the United States and its trading partners has 
helped keep a lid on prices at home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technological advances through computerization have allowed manufacturers to 
produce more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 * Workers continue to worry about job security and are less likely to demand 
big wages. 
</P>
<P>
 * Manufacturers increasingly are successfully using temporary help to meet 
swings in the business cycle, meaning that manufacturers will be slow to hire 
full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * The traditional yardsticks used to gauge the economy's strength -- such as 
factory use, factory-worker overtime and industrial output -- are of limited 
value, given the shrinking role of manufacturing and the dominant role of 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Data suggest the service-producing sector -- which includes everything from 
Hollywood to health services to hotels -- is operating well below full 
capacity. That would reduce the likelihood of a big buildup in price pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's premature to sound the alarms of serious inflation," said Gerard Adams 
of the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 This group also said the Fed must go easy when tightening credit and boosting 
interest rates. Monetary policy, in their view, is an inexact art at best. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monetary policy is a meat ax. It's not a scalpel," said Donald Hilty, a 
former Chrysler Corp. economist who is now a senior fellow at the Economic 
Strategy Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Central bankers are fighting yesterday's war," said James Robinson, former 
chairman of American Express Co.

 Chevron Denies Caspian Pipeline Move: The petroleum company denied that it is 
seeking a 50% stake in a new oil pipeline from Kazakhstan to Russia's Black Sea 
port of Novorossiisk. Chevron Corp. said Interfax news agency misquoted a 
Russian energy minister after talks with Chevron Chairman Kenneth Derr.The 
talks covered Chevron's latest proposals to break a deadlock over financing the 
$1.2-billion Caspian Pipeline Consortium. Chevron said previously that it was 
being asked to contribute virtually all the financing in exchange for a 25% 
share in the consortium. Under Chevron's proposal to provide half the financing 
for 25% ownership, Russia and Kazakhstan would buy 25% each with existing 
pipeline assets. Another 25% would go to a fourth partner that could match 
Chevron's financial support.

 API Says Alternate Fuels Get $1-Billion Federal Subsidy: A study by the 
American Petroleum Institute, the largest trade association of the U.S. oil and 
natural gas industry, says that total federal support for all alternative fuels 
and vehicles is currently running more than $1 billion a year. The study, 
released at API's annual meeting held in Century City, lumps such direct 
support as research grants for improved electric batteries along with the 
less-direct financial effects of such federal requirements as those mandating 
increased use of cleaner-burning fuels by federal fleets.

PARSONS, TAYLOR IN STEP; DUO, WHO PERFORM IN IRVINE TONIGHT, MELD DANCE AND 
JAZZ

 When dancer-choreographer David Parsons began working with jazz pianist Billy 
Taylor, he learned one thing very quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 "Billy's not going to play the same way every night," Parsons said in a recent 
interview. That meant Parsons would have to adapt to at least some new music at 
every performance. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was part of the challenge, since the dancer wouldn't dream of asking 
Taylor to play the same thing night after night. "You don't do that with jazz 
musicians if you understand jazz," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons, 35, was speaking by phone recently from backstage at a theater in 
Muncie, Ind., one stop on a 12-city tour that includes shows tonight and 
Tuesday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, where he and Taylor are presenting their 
collaborative "Step Into My Dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons was one of the leading dancers in the Paul Taylor Dance Company for 
nine years before leaving in 1987 to form his own company. Billy Taylor, 72, 
has had an illustrious jazz career that has spanned half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 The two met several years ago while they were appearing separately in a summer 
festival in Tucson. "We had dinner together," Parsons said. "We liked each 
other." A mutual friend suggested they collaborate. "We said, 'Yeah!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Taylor: "I saw his work and really enjoyed it. It's very imaginative and 
different from most of the dance companies I had worked with. I was very 
excited about a collaboration. And it really was a collaboration." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So much so that Taylor's trio -- Taylor on piano, bassist Chip Jackson and 
drummer Steve Johns -- appears onstage with the nine members of Parsons' 
company during "Step Into My Dream" on this tour, rather than remaining 
anonymously out of sight in the orchestra pit. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said he tried to give Parsons a broad range of musical moods to work 
with. "The things he did were so athletic, so different, I didn't really know 
what to write for him, so I wrote a wide variety of things," Taylor said. "I 
had kind of a story-line base -- a walk down 125th Street (in Harlem), how it 
used to look and sound. I wrote about an hour's worth of music. I told David, 
'You're free to take what you want, put it in any order you want.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Parsons: "He came up with some beautiful stuff. He goes through time. . . 
. He saw the past, the present and the future, how different clubs' music 
changed: Jazz through the ages, all the way up from blues and ragtime to rap." 
</P>
<P>
 But Parsons doesn't take the audience on exactly the same walk, according to 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote 'Kim's Song,' " he said. "He heard it as a very romantic song, 
choreographed it for two people. I had thought of it as a sort of promenade, 
with lots of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then 'Uncle Bob': For me what I had in mind, there was this nightclub, really 
just a little bar down from the Apollo (Theater) and a solo pianist who 
reminded me of my uncle who used to play this style, but this guy could really 
play this style. (So I wrote) a little ragtime piece. But (David) doesn't do a 
ragtime dance. He does a very eccentric, a little abstract dance." 
</P>
<P>
 "Billy gave me total leeway," Parsons said. "We tightened some things, 
lengthened some things, played with the order. It was wonderful what Billy did. 
He gave me a wide variety of music, all original, which I love in this world of 
things that are so meticulously controlled in videos or movies. It's great to 
have that freedom. Every night there's a difference in the performance. There's 
structure to it, but within that structure, (dancers and musicians) are 
improvising. 
</P>
<P>
 "Improvisation can be very indulgent, if you do it without a structure around 
it," he added. "But we've been working for four years now on improvisation, 
using different things -- live radio, different music. It was all getting ready 
to work with Dr. Taylor." 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of the piece, there is a section in which Parsons decides who is 
to dance only moments before the company goes on, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can pick duets, trios or just single dancers. No one knows who's going to 
start. The only stipulation is that (the dancers) point to the musicians they 
want to use, whether just piano or just drums or both or whatever. You point to 
them. To start (the dance), you bow to them. To finish, you bow, to put a 
period on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inspiration goes back and forth. It's right there in front of you, then 
it's gone. It embodies my dancers' sensitivity and creativity they don't 
usually get to show." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said that it's this middle section that varies the most. "It's 
literally different every time we do it because even if he picks the same 
dancers, they can chose different musicians," he said. "The music comes from 
the movement, the movement comes from the music. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it really is a stretch, and for the dancers also, I think. There is 
so much difference between a dancer dancing to a record or a tape and dancing 
to live music. There's an excitement that happens every time to all concerned. 
But there was never any part that we felt wasn't going to work. I had so much 
faith in David." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Parsons Dance Company will collaborate with the Billy Taylor Trio in 
"Step Into My Dream" tonight and Tuesday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 
Campus Drive in Irvine. The program also includes Parsons' "Nascimento" and 
"Caught," and Taylor originals and jazz standards. 8 p.m. $25. (714) 854-4646.

O.C. JAZZ REVIEW; REEVES, HARGROVE: A MUSICAL MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pairing -- storytelling singer Dianne Reeves on stagewith young trumpet 
sensation Roy Hargrove's quintet -- seemed odd at first glance, the kind of 
billing that could rein in the enthusiasm of both as they'd avoid stepping on 
each other's toes. 
</P>
<P>
 But any such concerns were proven false Friday night at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center where Reeves, one of the finest in the business, stepped 
up to become just another member of Hargrove's front line, joining him and 
saxophonist Ron Blake in round-robin improvisational exchanges that saw their 
contrasting tones and personalities merging into a splendid musical whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was this more apparent than at the concert's close when Hargrove, 
Reeves and Blake stood shoulder to shoulder to do Cyrus Chestnut's funk anthem 
"Greens at the Chicken Shack." Passing the lead back and forth in an 
anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better session, the three bounced ideas back and 
forth and stirred each other to higher and higher planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Reeves and Hargrove are experts in spontaneity, improvising with assured, 
fluid clarity: Each note followed perfectly behind its predecessor. And though 
both have technique to spare, the pace of their delivery was never rushed, and 
there was no display of skill for its own sake (a la Wynton Marsalis). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The strong instrumental qualities of Reeves' voice were audible from her 
opening number with the quintet, Mongo Santamaria's "Afro-Blue." Contrasted 
with Blake's inviting soprano solo, Reeves proved every bit as agile and 
inventive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Softly, as in a Morning Sunrise" found both Hargrove and Reeves working in 
clear, direct tones with only a minimum of vibrato, a style that recalled Miles 
Davis' ballad playing. At tune's end, Reeves took a turn without accompaniment, 
providing her own rhythmic support with breathy, percussive bursts that 
accented her wordless scatting. 
</P>
<P>
 The most prevalent influence felt Friday night well may have been the most 
appropriate: that of Carmen McRae, who had died earlier in the week. Reeves 
broke into one of her trademark improvisational digressions during 
"Yesterdays," singing about an uncle who had exposed her to the records of Ella 
Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and, especially, McRae -- "a great interpreter of 
lyrics . . . she told a story every time" -- words that apply equally to Reeves 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Parallels can be drawn as well between the deliveries of Hargrove and McRae, 
to whom he dedicated what has become his signature ballad piece, "Never Let Me 
Go." His fluegelhorn work during the number was especially warm and wise, the 
kind that touches both the heart and the intellect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though he is only 25, Hargrove's playing seldom reflects the brashness or 
self-indulgence of youth. And he works in fine company. His foil, saxophonist 
Blake, is more from the considered Wayne Shorter school than the 
sheets-of-sound Coltrane camp. Standing with elbows erect (a posture that gave 
him a bird-like appearance), he worked in short bursts and single, weighty 
notes as he developed his solos -- an attack especially successful during such 
beat-heavy material as "Greens at the Chicken Shack" and Hargrove's greasy 
spoon anthem "Soppin' the Biscuit." 
</P>
<P>
 Another standout soloist was pianist Peter Martin, who varied his melodic, 
chordally rich work with inquisitive lines and dissonant statements. Martin 
showed an impressive left hand when accompanying Reeves in "I've Got It Bad 
(And That Ain't Good)," and his ballad playing was beautifully developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Rodney Whitaker worked around the beat, pushing hard during funk 
numbers, laying back on ballads. His improvisation during "Never Let Me Go" 
explored the melody in a way that recalled Ron Carter's detailed work. Drummer 
Gregory Hutchinson showed on- and off-beat skills and was especially impressive 
with his mallets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hargrove's quintet is a tight, responsive unit -- much more than window 
dressing for its celebrity leader. And though the core of the band has been 
together some three years, it is not inflexible: It stirred Reeves into the mix 
as easily as it did Joe Henderson, Johnny Griffin, Stanley Turrentine and 
Branford Marsalis, guest saxophonists on the group's latest album.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JOE ELY ROPES 'EM IN WITH ROCK 'N' SOUL; VETERAN TEXAS 
SINGER-SONGWRITER EASILY OUTSHINES THE OTHERS AT COACH HOUSE QUADRUPLE-HEADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Ely hit the Coach House like a high-plains wind Saturday night, rocking 
with untamed energy and robust good humor, singing ballads of philosophic depth 
and poetic grace, and demonstrating a largeness of spirit that temporarily blew 
away the pervading national stench of politics as egg-throwing. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics isn't his concern as a songwriter and song-chooser. But the songs 
this veteran West Texas roots-rock and country exponent sings, and the 
unrestrained gusto he brings to his calling, paint an American vision far more 
attractive than the petty backbiting purveyed at such great expense in so many 
of our recent political races. In Ely's idealistic ethic, romanticism and 
anti-materialist values are bound inextricably together. Witness the pumped-up 
refrain he sang near the end of his show: "Would you settle for love, or do you 
need all that meaningless stuff?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ely (rhymes with "wheelie") played an expansive solo-acoustic show that had 
nothing in common with refined folkishness; he delivered everything in a voice 
as sturdy as a pair of Levi's. "My name is Joe Ely and I'm here to rock this 
joint tonight," he announced near the start, and he made good on the promise 
with ringing anthems full of big imagery and high ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 The set also contained many an exuberant tall tale -- to the delight of a 
rowdy, responsive audience whose whoops and pleas for favorites seemed to spur 
Ely on. He also gave the hurting and mysterious side of life its due in 
haunting ballads and tense meditations. 
</P>
<P>
 As he always has in a recording career that stretches back 17 years, he 
interspersed his own songs with excellent selections from a coterie of Texas 
compatriots who are so closely allied that one hardly can be thought of without 
the others. The one-hour, 45-minute show included songs by Jimmie Dale Gilmore, 
Butch Hancock, Terry Allen and a relative newcomer, Robert Earl Keen -- 
writer/performers who along with Ely have helped make Austin a roots-music 
center of earthy vitality and adventurous individualism, a sort of denim-clad, 
dusty-booted Athens set against the Roman commercial bazaar of Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely didn't play anything from "Songs From Chippy," the excellent recent album 
with which he and others from his musical circle provided the music for a play 
based on the diaries of a Depression-era prostitute who worked the oil district 
of West Texas. Let's hope that plans for a 1995 touring revue of "Chippy" come 
to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He did debut a few new songs. "All Just to Get to You," one of several titanic 
romantic anthems that made it into the set, is a new companion to such older 
songs as "Sleepless in Love," "For Your Love" and "Settle for Love." Like U2, 
Ely has the fervor to pump his anthems full of conviction. But he goes Bono one 
better by at least sometimes giving earthy ballast to his soaring passions. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Sleepless in Love," humorous similes along the lines of "She was tender, 
soft as a Kmart pillow" give a playful, textured slant to conventional rock 
romanticism. It lets Ely wink at his own pumped-up conceit of two lovers 
breaking all bonds, but it also makes the point that ordinary lives revolving 
around the Kmart aisles, gypsy car lots and recreational vehicles that pop up 
in the song can scale extraordinary heights of passion and romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely has built his reputation as a fiery performer with hard-charging bands in 
which he shares the spotlight with excellent lead guitarists. Playing solo, 
however, he was in no need of a hot, string-bending sidekick: In addition to 
his customary boisterous strumming, he flew into guitar solos of his own that 
perfectly complemented his robust, let-it-fly performing approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing some of the least fastidious good guitar imaginable, he would venture 
off on unpredictable sallies during which he seemed to have no firm idea where 
his fingers were heading -- trusting, like the personas in many of his songs, 
that he could make it through on sheer nerve. Score one for nerve (supported, 
no doubt, by a good deal of practice). 
</P>
<P>
 The show peaked with an encore made up of three songs drawn from his 1978 
album, "Honky Tonk Masquerade."  
</P>
<P>
 "Boxcars," a Butch Hancock song, is the dark, searing contemplation of a man 
who stands by the railroad tracks, his life at a breaking point, wondering 
whether he should jump onto a train -- or under it. Ely finished with intense 
hammering on his guitar that brought the song to a resounding, dramatic climax. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of exiting to the ensuing standing ovation, he followed with an 
excellent ballad lament, "Because of the Wind," that uses simple nature imagery 
and an aching melody to pose unanswerable questions about why life bends us 
like trees in a gale. He finished on a rocking upbeat with "Fingernails," a 
raunchy ode to the wild-eyed rocking spirit embodied by Jerry Lee Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "No use for a man to keep a mighty river all dammed up inside," Ely had sung 
earlier in the show. There wasn't a moment in this big-as-life performance when 
he didn't play as if he fully believed that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kelly also sings about great passions. But the accomplished 
singer-songwriter from Australia takes a more refined approach that in 
comparison to Ely came off a bit thin. 
</P>
<P>
 His hourlong set offered plenty of worthwhile, well-crafted songs founded on 
good melodies and perceptive psychological insights (although several 
unrecorded new numbers were beneath his standard). Wan of look, mild of manner 
and monotonously reedy of voice, Kelly simply didn't infuse his live 
performance with enough heat to make his songs as vivid as they are on record. 
</P>
<P>
 He had help from Randy Jacobs, a Was (Not Was) alumnus who fleshed out songs 
with clean, economically played blues and R&B influenced electric guitar licks. 
But Kelly could have used the support of the full band and nicely detailed 
arrangements that enrich his songs on record. Playing in stark duo or solo 
settings, he failed to throw off his characteristic reserve and live up to the 
title of the set's most vivid tune, "We've Started a Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening was notable for the return of Kerry Getz, a solo-acoustic 
performer who had shown promise coming up on the Orange County scene before 
moving to Los Angeles three years ago to concentrate her efforts there. Now she 
is back in O.C. after some apparently nightmarish experiences on the ground 
floor of the recording industry to which she alluded in one of her song intros. 
</P>
<P>
 Her involving, accomplished, and richly emotive set revealed that the promise 
evident in past Coach House gigs has been fully realized. Her voice hit with 
persuasive force or danced with nuanced delicacy as the moment required, and 
ranged confidently between the purity of Joni Mitchell folkdom to the low, 
throaty drawl (on the falling-in-lust song "Make Me Go Weak") of a Chrissie 
Hynde. 
</P>
<P>
 Her writing is on a high level. Chilling imagery that recalled Sylvia Plath 
powers the harrowing "Let Me Out." In "Summer Afternoon," Getz's lilting, 
breezy vocal and guitar line captured an inviting world full of promise -- 
which made the song all the more wrenching as it unfolded into a tragic vision 
of possibilities snuffed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Getz has the coffeehouse experience to set an audience at ease with witty 
banter full of self-deprecating humor; she also has the openness to talk about 
being shaken by the deaths of a brother and a beloved pet dog, then memorialize 
them in a song, "There I Am," a hushed, haunting reflection on how the dead 
remain real but heartbreakingly fleeting presences in our lives. An older song, 
"Apollo," remains a memorable lament full of world-weary yearning. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, Getz is ready for a national platform. Considering the tale 
of woe she told about her struggles in Los Angeles, she deserves a break. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The quadruple-header began with a brief set by Nan Vernon, a comely waif-like 
singer who has backed Dave Stewart and is scheduled to release her first U.S. 
album early next year. Raised in California, now based in England, she has the 
voice of a solid contender, mixing strains theatrical (a bit of tremulous Kate 
Bush), airy (a la Susanna Hoffs) and dark and weighty (like Kristin Hersh). 
</P>
<P>
 Her songs weren't striking, though. With only some throaty distortion on her 
electric guitar to offset her sighing vocals, she fell into sameness of tone, 
tempo and mood with her romantic-rejection subject matter. Several attractive 
choruses turned up, however, and the delicate closing number, "Lay Down Joe," 
would be worth another hearing.

MUSIC REVIEWS; VIENNA SYMPHONY STAYS COURSE IN CERRITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Performances of Ravel's familiar orchestration of Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an 
Exhibition" can tip the balance toward either composer. Rafael Fruhbeck de 
Burgos, leading the Vienna Symphony on Saturday at the Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts, favored the Frenchman. 
</P>
<P>
 The conductor emphasized clarity, balance, luxuriant sound and the brilliantly 
conceived scoring, as opposed to expressions of Slavic soul. This emphasis also 
surfaced in music by Mahler and Hans Erich Apostel, also on the program. 
Fruhbeck will lead the orchestra in a different program tonight in Costa Mesa, 
under the sponsorship of the Orange County Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's results were eminently well-delineated but depersonalized 
"Exhibition" pictures. The crescendo and falling off in "Bydlo" were seamless, 
for instance, but the Polish oxcart did not bear the weight of ages. The 
trumpet in "Samuel Goldenburg and Schmuyle" articulated its nervous patter 
perfectly, but the pain within the whining never materialized. "The Great Gate 
at Kiev" reveled in orchestral colors, but not in the triumph of the spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 A triumph of the spirit also was what Mahler wanted in his Tenth Symphony, 
which he did not complete. He did, however, finish the Adagio, holographic in 
portraying stages toward accepting death. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, we can do without the swooning and schmaltz, which some conductors stress, 
maybe. But not without the Angst, the protest, the alarms, the comfort, the 
little dances back into life before the final quiet acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 Fruhbeck relied mainly on muscular line, clean articulation and accumulated 
architecture for effect. He got it toward the end, as the tempo slowed yet 
again, the massive scoring died down to shimmering strings, the oboe initiated 
recollections of heroism. But a lot of the journey to this point had lacked 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 He had opened the program with another fragment -- Apostel's Passacaglia, the 
only movement of a projected Concerto for Orchestra that the composer lived to 
complete. The four-minute threnody, written according to strict dodecaphonic 
procedures, partakes of affecting Bergian lyricism, however. 
</P>
<P>
 As an encore, Fruhbeck led the spirited Intermezzo from Gimenez's "La Boda de 
Luis Alonso." 
</P>
<P>

MUSIC REVIEWS; LULLABIES FROM THE LIZST CHAMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra is for people who like to listen to 
classical music with their feet up in an easy chair while reading a book. Then 
they fall asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a highly stylized type of playing. The Franz Liszt's sound, under its 
longtime leader and concertmaster Janos Rolla, is polished to a lustrous sheen, 
but is never brilliant or steely, or golden or burnished for that matter. It is 
a distinctly silken sonority, the violins sugary sweet and soft-edged, the 
violas, cellos and bass of this 17-member string ensemble acting as poised 
foundation. Homogeneity is striven for at all costs, and achieved. Pizzicatos 
become puffy satin pillows of sound. 
</P>
<P>
 As heard Saturday in Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center (the group was also scheduled to appear Sunday at UCLA), the 
much-recorded, Budapest-based ensemble, now on its 10th U.S. tour, delivered 
the cushy goods once again. The program offered Dvorak and Tchaikovsky lite as 
a framework, with some easy-listening baroque in the middle. Luckily, guitarist 
Angel Romero was on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 In a show within a snooze, Romero played his own arrangements of the Oboe 
Concerto in C by Alessandro Marcello and the Lute Concerto in D, R. 93, by 
Vivaldi. To both works he brought an effortless virtuosity and projection 
(without amplification), and a vital, engaging musicianship. 
</P>
<P>
 The two slow movements were particularly cherishable, with Romero's fluid use 
of color and articulation, singing phrasing and vibrato, and dead-center 
timing. Rolla and orchestra stayed nicely out of his way and showed some spirit 
in the finales. 
</P>
<P>
 In a solo encore, Romero captured every inch of the giddy showmanship in the 
Fantasia from the "Andaluza" Suite by his father, Celedonio Romero. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings, Opus 48, and Dvorak's Serenade for 
Strings, Opus 22, Rolla led well-drilled, emotionally wan performances. Not 
that either of these works plumb the depths of profundity, but Rolla and 
ensemble opted for smooth surfaces throughout. There's an especial effort to 
avoid hard attacks in this orchestra, a refusal to press the bow for intensity. 
The results are obviously what these musicians set out for, but why should we 
find lulling such a lofty goal?
