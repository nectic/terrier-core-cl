O.C. ART REVIEW; 'MUSIC' ACHIEVES HARMONY WITH SETTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After enduring numerous examples of bad public art in Orange County, some of 
us have come to be grateful for any work that isn't hopelessly bland, inept, 
intrusive or improperly scaled to its surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 So Nancy Mooslin's new 12-part interactive piece for Fred Lang Park in Laguna 
Beach, "Music of the Spheres," comes as a pleasant surprise even if it 
disappoints in one major way. Incredibly, it is Mooslin's first piece of public 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist, from Newport Beach, won a $20,000 competition sponsored by the 
Laguna Beach Arts Commission as part of the city's Art in Public Places 
program, which requires 1% of each major construction budget -- in this case, 
the recent park renovation -- to fund a work of art on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Named for the ancient belief -- bolstered by the findings of 17th-Century 
astronomer and mathematician Johannes Kepler -- in a universe ordered by the 
same numerical proportions that produce musical harmonies, "Music of the 
Spheres" has several good things going for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Most obviously, the rainbow-hued arcs topping each of the 12 black poles are 
clearly visible from South Coast Highway. Rising 16 to 20 feet, the painted 
steel shapes give the park an enhanced public presence in a cheerful way suited 
to a place where children play. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the airy, linear outlines of the piece don't compete with the view of the 
ocean from inside the park. (Art trying to upstage nature tends to run into the 
same problems adult actors have when they share a scene with children or 
animals.) 
</P>
<P>
 On a metaphorical level, Mooslin -- whose work has long been involved with 
relationships between music and arcs of color -- described the piece in a 
statement as relating to "the rising and setting sun . . . the turning of the 
Earth on its axis, the phases of the moon, and the harmony and beauty of the 
landscape." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the arc described by the graduated heights of the 12 components of the 
piece can be likened to the path of the sun. The progressive narrowing and 
widening of the open space in the arcs serves as an analogy for the waxing and 
waning of the moon, and the slightly different spatial orientations of these 
colorful elements plausibly suggest the Earth's 24-hour (12 times two) rotation 
on its axis. 
</P>
<P>
 The groupings of three colored arcs on each pedestal evoke the role of triads 
(musical chords made up of three tones) in traditional harmony. Harmony also 
emanates from the piece in a literal sense, from the three tubular metal wind 
chimes attached to each pole. If you run your fingers through the chimes on 
each pole, you get what sounds pleasantly like a rising scale. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sounds are too soft to compete with the traffic noise on South Coast 
Highway. It's hard to imagine that even a major windstorm would coax enough 
"music of the spheres" to be heard even a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 Mooslin herself says the ambient noise problem was "the one thing I didn't 
fully comprehend" when planning the piece in her Los Angeles loft. "It would be 
lovely if you could hear this ringing sound without standing five inches away," 
she agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city has not complained about the sound level, Mooslin says she 
is planning to solve the problem by replacing the chimes with larger ones or 
with chimes that have an internal, bell-like clapper. 
</P>
<P>
 As is the case with virtually every public project, the birth of "Music of the 
Spheres" was attended by controversy and compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, after a panel of art professionals whittled 93 entries down to 
five semifinal designs, the City Council raised a ruckus over the positioning 
of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the competition prospectus, the sculpture was to have been placed 
on or along the eight-foot chain-link fence that separates the park's playing 
field from South Coast Highway. But City Council members and some residents 
voiced concerns about the dangers of a piece that might motivate youngsters to 
climb the fence, and the intrusion of the piece onto the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
 So the arts commission sent a letter to the semifinalists asking them to pay 
more attention to safety and durability issues and asking how they would feel 
about positioning their work in an unspecified location elsewhere in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Mooslin's original concept, the arcs were to rise out of the ground and 
bisect the fence. Bowing to safety concerns, she decided to lift the arcs above 
the reach of climbing children and make them completely free-standing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think the piece was visually improved by the need to solve the 
safety problem," she says. "(The original version) wouldn't have been visible 
from the street. And, because the idea has to do with the orbiting Earth, it 
definitely is appropriate for the piece to be up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the city decided not to change the site of the piece, but Mooslin 
figured out how to anchor the poles just four inches from the fence so that 
they barely encroach on the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any problem is solvable," she insists. "It just takes some compromise. What 
this has taught me is that it doesn't have to mean aesthetic compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Music of the Spheres" is at Fred Lang Park, Wesley Drive and South Coast 
Highway in Laguna Beach.

MODERNISM RUNS AMOK IN LONG BEACH; OPERA: MICHAEL MILENSKI'S IMAGINATIVE 
COMPANY OPENS SEASON WITH STRANGE PAIRING OF 'DIDO AND AENEAS' AND 'RIDERS TO 
THE SEA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In many ways, the Long Beach Opera is our most interesting opera company. 
Michael Milenski's brave little band may teeter in perpetuo on the brink of 
financial disaster, but it thrives on thinking big, paying little and always 
taking chances. There are no easy problems here, and certainly no easy 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The product may look odd at times and sound odder, but it is never boring. Not 
many operatic organizations can make that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 On a good day, Long Beach deals in revelations. Opera is treated as valid 
musical theater. Masterpieces -- well-known, long-neglected or virtually 
unknown -- are subjected to the healthy, probing light of iconoclastic 
reinterpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 On a bad day, Long Beach gets its opera mired in trendy-modern gobbledygook. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, alas, was a bad day. 
</P>
<P>
 To open the all-too brief 1994-95 season at the Center Theater, in conjunction 
with the UK/LA Festival, Milenski chose a pair of strange billfellows: Henry 
Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas," written in 1689, and Ralph Vaughan Williams' 
"Riders to the Sea," written in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are British. Both are short. Both require a modest performing apparatus. 
Beyond that, the two have little in common. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dido" deals in deathless antiquity and tells its tale with Baroque 
compression. "Riders to the Sea" dabbles in slice-of-life realism and speaks in 
the suppressed tones of a romanticism in decay. 
</P>
<P>
 The differences certainly do not preclude compatible pairing. Opposites can be 
attractive. The Long Beach forces, unfortunately, did a lot of stressful 
straining to impose a unified vision on Purcell and Vaughan Williams and came 
up in the middle of a stylistic muddle. 
</P>
<P>
 In a classic fit of fuzzy thinking, the dancerly director Tanya Blood Hinkel 
and her clever designer Adam Silverman decided to play both operas in the same 
sprawling sandbox. Get it? Footprints in the sands of time, and all that. 
</P>
<P>
 The cliche parade was lengthy. It began with a distracting gaggle of barefoot 
dancers, drafted to spook the central playing area as well as the aisles for 
both works. Acting was out. Picturesque posing was in. So, incidentally, was 
view-blocking for the unfortunate members of the audience trapped in seats 
behind the human statues. 
</P>
<P>
 The same hard-working, seemingly under-rehearsed cast was enlisted for each 
opus. Symbolism was generously applied throughout (Dido got herself wrapped 
into and out of an endless crimson sheet, apparently to signal crisis and/or 
catharsis). The orchestra became part of the set. Sliding panels defined 
changing locales upstage, creakily. 
</P>
<P>
 It all was supposed to be fraught with meaning. Deep meaning. It ended up 
being just plain pretentious and fussy. Also silly. 
</P>
<P>
 The period conventions of "Dido" resisted updated abstraction. The stark 
intimacy of "Riders to the Sea" resisted decorative clutter. More, in these 
cases, ended up being too much. 
</P>
<P>
 What was Dido, tragic Queen of Virgil's Carthage, doing at the beach? What was 
Maurya, mournful matriarch of Synge's Irish fishing village, doing at the 
beach? Beats us. 
</P>
<P>
 The pervasive theatrical obfuscation could have been mitigated, to a degree, 
by musical brilliance. No such luck. The music-making was hardly brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 Roderick Shaw conducted a scrappy little ensemble from the harpsichord for a 
rough and unready approximation of Purcell's glorious score. Cohesion was 
hampered beyond his control, moreover, by a staging scheme that kept the 
characters wandering, and the chorus splintered, at awkward distances. He 
stirred the dreary sonic soup dutifully on behalf of Vaughan Williams without 
sustaining much dynamic variety or dramatic tension. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Dido" cast was properly dominated by Janice Felty -- willowy, sensitive 
and poised in the title role. Ask not why she had to double as the Sorceress, 
or, for that matter, why Belinda's music was divided between two pretty-piping 
sopranos, Suzan Hanson and KristiPeterson (neither of whom seemed to be singing 
in English). James Demler served as a stoic, prosaic Aeneas. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Riders," Felty returned as a rather youthful Maurya, the old widow who 
loses all her sons to the sea. Now taut and tough, she refocused her energies 
wisely, though her lyric mezzo-soprano threatened to evaporate in lines 
specifically intended for a contralto. The others performed as sympathetically 
as conditions would allow.

ART REVIEW; A BURNING 'PASSION' FOR ANCIENT ART; THE GETTY SNARES THE FIRST 
PUBLIC DISPLAY OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S BEST PRIVATE COLLECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The grandiose "treasures" exhibitions of recent memory were a lot of fun, 
despite critical grumbling. One essential quality they really did lack, 
however, was a sense of the personal. They were like sultanic elephants 
designed by committee. All the same, now that they're gone we miss them and the 
good times they represented. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to both cheer us and correct the shortcomings of the past, the J. Paul 
Getty Museum presents an exhibition that is, hands down, the best thing of its 
kind we've seen in living memory. The sort of event the public should embrace 
and artniks revere, it marks the first public display of one of the world's 
best private collections of ancient art from the Mediterranean world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A Passion for Antiquities: Ancient Art From the Collection of Barbara and 
Lawrence Fleischman" encompasses more than 200 objects from ancient Etruria, 
Greece and Rome. Its curators are the Getty's Marion True and Arielle Kozloff 
of the Cleveland Museum of Art, where the ensemble will travel after closing 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars will find its copiously illustrated, carefully annotated catalogue 
indispensable. Casual visitors should be delighted with an installation design 
revolving around themes rather than formal categories. They emphasize the human 
factor that created this art and inspired the Fleischmans to collect it with 
such a heartfelt intuitive grasp of its intrinsic meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 The overarching theme of all this art is our species' striving to transcend 
its animal nature while retaining vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition's earliest work, a magnificent marble Cycladic "Head of an 
Idol," was made about 2600 BC. It has an awe-some simplicity that evokes 
humankind's earliest impulse to control the universe through rational thought. 
Little more than a smooth slab of marble with an inquiring nose, it is like a 
philosopher's touchstone. No wonder modern artists like Brancusi were so taken 
with such work. 
</P>
<P>
 If its directness strikes anyone as esoteric, there is an endearing little 
"Beak Spouted Jug" nearby whose pulled-back neck evokes a small bird drinking. 
In a way it echoes the head's combination of rational thought and natural 
observation. Looks practical too. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole exhibition has this quality of revelation. Gold jewelry, for 
example, usually attracts some of the value of the material and puts others off 
for the same reason. Here intricacy and artifice take the day. Earrings not 2 
inches tall bear fully modeled figures of a winged woman. A pair of piping 
satyrs are even smaller. It's the art that counts, but we are reminded that the 
special physical qualities of gold make it possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Objects are generally small, but it costs them no power. A section on animals 
includes a late Roman folding tripod whose uprights are topped with muscular 
horses. Their naturalism echoes exaggerated in other Hellenistic works like a 
Farnese-style statuette of Herakles and another of Jupiter clearly based on a 
Greek model. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the various sections, none is more enchanting and impressive than "The 
World of Dionysos." The Greek god of wine and revelry was, quite logically, 
also the patron of the theater. Barbara Fleischman wanted to be an actress as a 
young woman and her sensitivity to the subject shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Objects here look almost unsettlingly contemporary. A Roman bronze head of an 
adolescent Dionysos with his long curly hair and look of longing sensuality is 
a physical type women swoon for to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 A porky little bronze thought to represent the god as an infant also suggests 
him as the corpulent old Falstaff buffoon he became as the Bacchus of Rome (and 
Disney's "Fantasia"). But the piece is not jokey. The child's heavily lidded 
eyes bespeak the price of gluttony while his open stance reminds us that the 
urge to revelry is always a call back to childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater's tolerance for the unconventional shows in the figure of a mime 
in drag as a goddess, a grotesque terra-cotta mask and a little comedy face 
worthy of a modern special-effects artist. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real showstopper of the section is a wine caldron that looks like 
something only Hollywood could have invented. The body of the vessel resembles 
an ancient Chinese urn run through the Arabian nights on its way to an Art 
Nouveau Paris Metro station. Its legs bring modern rolling casters to mind. The 
smiling figure of Dionysos sprouting irrationally from the object is as 
delightfully energized as Carpeaux's sculpture around the Paris Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
 But the piece is, in fact, a unique 1st Century BC object from the 
much-maligned Roman Hellenistic period. Just goes to show that our culture is 
not the first to be gleefully eclectic. 
</P>
<P>
 The section is followed by an engaging nook of fantastic animals such as 
griffins and sirens. There are more sober presentations such as a grouping of 
related objects from the Roman provinces, but by then you've already started to 
absorb the graceful enthusiasms and eye for emotional authenticity that is the 
essence of this rare collection.

THEATER REVIEW; SALIERI HELPS UNDERMINE 'AMADEUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Peter Shaffer was young, he wanted to be a composer and conductor but was 
sidetracked into playwriting. His "Amadeus," like all his plays, reflects that 
early love. It is written like a piece of music -- in this case, naturally, 
Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
 In staging this drama about composer Antonio Salieri and Mozart, about 
mediocrity and genius, about asking God for the wrong thing and suffering for 
it, director Kent Johnson of the Huntington Beach Playhouse has provided a 
visually effective piece. Tom Phillips, Jude Lucas and Larry Watts' costumes 
look grand, and Martin Eckmann's setting (though his lighting often is too 
bright) is attractive and workable for Johnson's interesting blocking. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson has not heard the music in the writing. Particularly in this play, 
the action must flow continuously, whether brightly or somberly, once the 
rhythms of Shaffer's gossiping "Little Winds" set the tone. Too often even 
slight pauses between movements, alien tempi and unwarranted arias destroy the 
playwright's melody line and his dramatic counterpoint. It is a generally 
ponderous production, rather like Herbert von Karajan conducting Ravel. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is the stentorian performance by John Parker as Salieri, 
generally a one-note affair. He rarely gives a clear view into the character's 
fear and sense of guilt, of the turmoil of Salieri's struggle to reconcile the 
fame God has given his mediocrity and the godlike musical voice He has bestowed 
on nasty boy Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The one performance that helps give some semblance of musical shape to the 
production is Roger Shank's as Mozart, the foul-mouthed, giggling, lascivious 
creator of some of the world's most beautiful music. Shank's senses of timing, 
and of the light and shade in Mozart's slow decline, are impressive. He is 
funny, vibrant and, at the end, heartbreaking as he calls out in terror on his 
deathbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Melinda Zommick is very good as Mozart's greedy, thoughtless wife, Constanze; 
Nick Cook is outstanding and subtle in the supporting role of Emperor Joseph 
II, and Peter Balaskas, David Cramer and Donald H. Faye are quite good as the 
Viennese courtiers who help Salieri destroy Mozart with as little concern as 
they would wash out his tacky mouth with soap.

TV REVIEWS; NOVA REVEALS 'WILD CHILD'S' CHILLING, DISTURBING SECRETS 
</P>

<P>
 They named her "Genie," but psychiatrists and social workers never were able 
to coax her from the prison of her magic lamp. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the Temple City girl -- locked alone in her room and tied to a 
potty chair for more than 10 years before being rescued at age 13 -- is 
chilling by even today's standards. As told some 20 years later in tonight's 
"Nova" presentation, "Secret of the Wild Child," it is a perplexing portrait of 
not only the unfortunate girl but also the rather confused collection of 
professionals who took over her life in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1970, Genie, whose real name is Susan Wiley, emerged from her 
room with "non-human characteristics." She was unable to speak, could barely 
walk and spat repeatedly. Susan's new caretakers on "the Genie team" seemed 
confounded by their mission: Does one follow basic human instinct and try to 
nurture this child? Or is it more important to seize the moment (and federal 
research funds) to test competing theories of language and human development? 
</P>
<P>
 In the compelling "Wild Child," writer/producer/director Linda Garmon weaves 
this subtext of indecision through the well-preserved videotapes of Genie and 
current interviews with the principal researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Garmon skillfully permeates the documentary with images of Susan's face, a 
haunting tableau of apprehension, fear, happiness, vitality and more -- all 
mixed together. The viewer may have an overwhelming urge to hold her and tell 
her everything's going to be all right. 
</P>
<P>
 But in real life, Genie is last seen on tape following a foster placement in 
which she was punched because she vomited. She has regressed to the point of 
not speaking at all. Now living in an "adult care foster home" somewhere in 
California, she is keeping her mouth shut, it is explained, so she will never 
vomit again. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Secret of the Wild Child" airs at 8 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and 
KPBS-TV Channel 15, and at 9 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24. JOEL GREENBERG

 Record Orders: Nine days before it hits the stores, Walt Disney Home Video's 
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" on Monday had already received a landmark 
27-million advance retail orders. If the retailers' predictions are right, the 
video should quickly break the previous record set by another Disney release, 
"Aladdin," which sold more than 24-million copies in six months. That record 
bested yet another Disney video, "Beauty and the Beast, which sold 22-million 
copies. The first shipment of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" arrives in 
stores on Oct. 25; Disney hopes to fulfill all advance orders before Christmas.

 Canine Classics: PBS has announced plans for a new kids' series, "Wishbone," 
designed to instill a love of literature in young children. The program follows

 Twitty's Estate Sold: Fans, collectors and family members bid more than $1 
million for the belongings of the late country singer Conway Twitty over the 
weekend, snapping up everything from cars to Christmas decorations at a 
three-day auction at Twitty City, a Tennessee complex where the entertainer and 
his family lived. There were buyers for all 3,000 of the items offered, with 
Twitty's widow spending nearly $80,000 on a car, jewelry and a jukebox. But 
three of Twitty's children from an earlier marriage refused to buy any of their 
father's belongings. They had fought to stop the auction ordered this year by a 
Sumner County judge as a result of a family feud over disposition of Twitty's 
estate. Twitty died June 5, 1993, after a blood vessel burst in his abdomen. He 
was 59. QUICK TAKES

MUSIC REVIEW; SANTA BARBARA SYMPHONY WELCOMES BEN-DOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All that was missing were the klieg lights. It was the night that Gisele 
Ben-Dor came to town to take charge of the Santa Barbara Symphony.A full house 
packed the Arlington Theater and reps of officialdom extended kind words to 
welcome her. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben-Dor's stellar performance in last season's round of live auditions earned 
her the post left open by the death of music director Varujan Kojian. The 
season-opener, Saturday, was marked by a sense of resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly gifted, Ben-Dor brings charisma and cachet as this orchestra's first 
female conductor. She lends a firm, flexible hand to the task, as heard in a 
solidly executed -- if predictable -- program. 
</P>
<P>
 Less ecstatically, some have criticized Ben-Dor's revision of the season's 
planned programs. After being stripped of some of the more enticing works, the 
repertory looks less balanced than it might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Ben-Dor took a confident trip down the middle. The concert's 
first half boasted crisp clarity and neatly sculpted dynamics from the 
orchestra, in material that seemed like an extended fanfare. It's hard to 
squeeze much new life out of Bernstein's Overture to "Candide," and from 
Richard Strauss' Suite from "Der Rosenkavalier." 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Santiago Rodriguez brought finely tuned sensitivity and commanding 
technical flourish to Brahms' Concerto No. 1, with an orchestra that was, 
aptly, alternately brooding and bold. JOSEF WOODARD

TV REVIEWS; 'SCHOOL COLORS': RACISM GONE AMOK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forty years after the Supreme Court's Brown vs. Board of Education decision 
supposedly marked the death watch of segregation in America's schools, race 
politics continues to run like an unbeatable virus through the campus.And if 
there's a way to take "Frontline's" season premiere, the 150-minute "School 
Colors," as a mirror on today's typical high school, the virus has produced 
racism's evil twin: tribalism. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes matters worse is that Berkeley High, in California, is no typical 
campus. Eighty percent of the school's graduates proceed to college. This is a 
public school that manages to recruit prospective students away from private 
prep schools, despite rumblings of increased on-campus violence. But 
underneath, it's a chaotic tug-of-war between ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Some viewers will interpret what they're shown at Berkeley High as PC run 
amok, while others will side with the black student in an African American 
studies class who insists that "integration was the second worse thing that 
ever happened to black men, next to slavery." But his teacher, Hodari Davis, 
conducts his classes with a clearly black separatist slant that has Davis' 
liberal colleagues wondering out loud if this studies program isn't fostering 
precisely what desegregation values opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 * "School Colors" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and at 9:30 p.m. on 
KPBS-TV Channel 15.

 PUBLIC PRESSURE: Health experts Monday joined a growing list of Ventura County 
officials opposed to a ballot measure aimed at slowing the tide of illegal 
immigration (B1). . . . But Steve Frank, who heads the county campaign in 
support of Proposition 187, said he recalls the last time a measure created 
such a stir: It was 1978, and the measure was the anti-tax initiative 
Proposition 13. . . . "Every government agency, every school board, every 
library group, every religious leader opposed Prop. 13," Frank said. "And you 
know what? It passed 2-to-1."

 BABY BONANZA: Talk about practicing what you preach. Four nurses at the 
Women's Unit at Simi Valley Hospital are pregnant and due to have babies by 
year's end. . . . The other nurses in the maternity ward will throw a baby 
shower today for their pregnant counterparts. A few other nurses are due in 
late spring. . . . "We're going to be running around like crazy after they all 
deliver," labor and delivery nurse Sharon Martin said. "We're thinking about 
wearing roller blades just to keep up." 
</P>
<P>
 KEEPING SECRETS: So much for the high-tech gadgetry that Amgen uses to protect 
company secrets. . . . Last year, when a laboratory worker hatched a scheme to 
cart Amgen's secrets off to the pharmaceutical black market, it was an 
anonymous letter, undoubtedly mailed by an alert employee, that thwarted the 
piracy scheme (Valley Business, Page 4). . . . "Your employees are your best 
line of defense," said Bill Boni, Amgen's chief of security. 
</P>
<P>
 VIDEO VENTURE: The Cops And Jocks program has wrapped up filming for an 
anti-gang video set to be shown in every Ventura County high school this year. 
. . . "We're trying to encourage kids to make the right choices," Cops And 
Jocks spokesman Rich Randolph said. The program, run by the Santa Paula Police 
Department, enables officers to adopt high school football teams throughout the 
county. . . . "Kids in high school these days don't like police officers," 
Randolph said. "We're bridging that gap."

 Everyone in L.A. has a business card . . . "Even the homeless," points out 
Anabel Aispuro, who enclosed a card for a company called "Homeless Recycling," 
which specializes in picking up glass and can items. "We do parties," the card 
adds.

 We still weren't convinced until we received the calling card of Emma Chase 
Collins in the mail. Her card listed her address on Wellington Road in the 
Lafayette Square area of L.A. And it gave her title as:

 Attn. creative bookkeepers: "I always thought there was such a thing," mused 
Steve Shirley of Sierra Madre, who came upon a catalogue item for people who 
wish to inflate claims.

 It reminds us of the story told by Will Fowler in "Reporters" about his 
father, Gene, a onetime star Hearst reporter. Sent to cover the search for 
three Navy balloonists who had crashed in the Canadian wilderness, Fowler hired 
a private railroad car and spent a lot of time losing money at poker. 
</P>
<P>
 To help offset his gambling losses, the elder Fowler concocted a story about 
buying a (nonexistent) dog team, which required medical expenses for the brave 
lead dog, who had fathered pups and eventually, tragically, died.

<P>
 When the Hearst controller found $60 of his advance money still unaccounted 
for, Fowler scribbled a note to the accountant that said:

AL MARTINEZ: ALONE ON AN ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the kind of sunset that God intended for tourists, full of startling 
reds and pastel pinks, all laced with shades of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Seen from the veranda of a century-old hotel, the colors set the Strait of 
Juan de Fuca afire, so brilliant was their reflection on the water. 
</P>
<P>
 We were on Orcas Island, which is part of the San Juan group, in a finger of 
the ocean that separates Washington state from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 A ferryboat moving out from the slip below cut a lazy trail through the inlet, 
adding movement to the stationary grandeur of the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife, Cinelli, was taking pictures and I was basking in the sunset, 
thinking how lucky to be so far from the pandemonium of L.A. in a beauty almost 
beyond description. Suddenly the guy next to me sighed heavily and said, 
appropos to nothing, "What a lot of crapola." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't usually talk to strangers when I am on vacation, because they are 
mostly from places like Houston, Tex., or Allentown, Pa., and have nothing to 
say that I care to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinelli loves to make new friends and gathers them in like bundles of wheat. 
Eventually we adopt them and lend them money and absorb all of their misery and 
end up wishing to hell we'd never heard of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The man on the veranda captured my attention because he seemed so p.o.'d in 
paradise. His comment, like a burp in church, was an intrusion into my moment 
of serenity, and I resented it. So I said, "Just exactly what are you talking 
about?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out, the guy, whose name was Harry, was an L.A. expatriate who had fled 
the city years ago in search of just the Right Place to Be, the way Dorothy had 
set out to find Oz. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry's search had begun in the L.A. area itself. Born in the Valley, he had 
moved from Encino to Hollywood to Santa Monica to Thousand Oaks, but had not 
been happy in any of those places. 
</P>
<P>
 He disliked crime, noise, smog, neighbors, barking dogs and his first wife, 
Ellen, who didn't like him either and who, tired of his eternal state of 
dismay, kicked Harry out. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided life would be better in Sacramento, which is where he moved next, 
but that wasn't what he was looking for either. It had all of the lousy things 
L.A. had, except for Ellen, and Harry found it too much to take. 
</P>
<P>
 Eureka was next, but the air smelled funny from the paper mills, so after a 
few months Harry moved to Astoria, Ore., and then to Ilwaco, just across the 
border in Washington, where he lived in a motel under a waterfront bar, and 
finally to Orcas Island. 
</P>
<P>
 He liked Orcas at first and even married again, but Wife 2 apparently also 
found Harry's negative attitude too much to bear and after awhile departed for 
Seattle, never to return. 
</P>
<P>
 The day I met Harry he was ready to move again. He'd grown tired of trees, 
sunsets, water, serenity, ferryboats and little birds that perched on his 
windowsills like animated creatures from a Disney movie, begging for crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry, so help me, was weary of this island paradise and itching to get back 
to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I thought about that for the rest of our trip, as we wandered through the 
Northwest. My intention in the first place was to find just such an island in 
the Strait of Juan de Fuca, because I have always had this romantic notion of a 
place isolated by water that would bring total peace of mind, beyond the reach 
of celebrity trials and media whores. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Harry, I was looking for the Perfect Place, but only on a temporary 
basis. To paraphrase Adlai Stevenson, I wanted to rest for awhile, to sit under 
a tree with a glass of wine and watch the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 I found such a tree at Capt. Whidbey's Inn on Whidbey Island, and then at the 
grand old Orcas Hotel on Orcas Island. Now I have two islands of peace and 
beauty, and I'll return to them both someday. 
</P>
<P>
 But I also discovered, thanks to Harry, that life is composed of many islands. 
His is an island of discontent, which he will never leave, and mine an island 
of imagination, on which I have always dwelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Small towns are also islands, isolated plots of parochial interests, far from 
a mainland of vast movements and large themes. We saw many on our trip and knew 
in our hearts why the islands existed, because they respond to an aching need 
for gentle days and quiet nights. 
</P>

GUNS ARE NOT US; TWO TOP FIRMS SAY THEY'LL STOP ORDERING REALISTIC TOY FIREARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like it or not, many American youngsters have idled away many a late afternoon 
playing games like cops-and-robbers with toy guns. For a time the only 
intrusion of reality into such good-guy bad-guy adventures was the unmistakable 
call from a parent around dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, however, these childhood shoot-'em-up fantasies are being 
shattered by the real thing. Earlier this year in New York City, Nicholas 
Heyward Jr., a 13-year-old straight-A student, was shot and killed by a 
housing-project police officer when a toy gun the boy was playing with was 
mistaken for the real thing. Another boy, Jamiel Johnson, 16, was wounded on 
the same day in the same city under much the same circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 These tragic incidents, and others, have appropriately prompted two retail toy 
firms, Toys R Us and Kay-Bee Toy Stores, to ban realistic-looking firearms. 
Toys R Us, the nation's largest toy chain, announced last week it will stop 
ordering realistic toy firearms. Kay-Bee Toys says it will remove the guns from 
shelves and destroy them.  
</P>
<P>
 These sensible moves, which the firms made voluntarily, could help save lives. 
What's more, their actions go further than current federal law, which requires 
only that "look-alike" toy firearms be affixed with a bright orange plug. As 
experience has shown, these colored seals can be removed or simply painted 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Toy gun sales make up 2% of retail toy sales, which amounts to about $237 
million a year. Some toy gun manufacturers take issue with the ban and wonder 
why big chains are targeting guns when there are plenty of other toys, like 
video-games, that contain graphic depictions of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 That's true. Still, it's highly unlikely that a child would be gunned down in 
the safety of his or her home playing Mortal Kombat. And kids still have 
options. Stores will continue to stock water guns and bold-colored guns that 
are clearly identifiable as toys.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the chances that another child will die because a toy gun is 
mistaken for a real one will be lessened.

PEACE AND THE FLOW OF WATER; ISRAEL, JORDAN PREPARE FOR AN ERA OF COOPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quietly, with visionary determination, the leaders of Israel and Jordan have 
led their countries into a new era. After 46 years of hostility, peace between 
Jordan and Israel is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 25, King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed a 
nonbelligerency pact at the White House, a vital first step toward normalizing 
their relations. Now, in Amman, they and their top advisers have resolved the 
last of the outstanding issues between them and a draft peace treaty has 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Small territorial adjustments along their lengthy border are to be made and 
agreement has been reached to launch new water projects on the Yarmouk River 
with the aim of increasing the volume of water going to Jordan. The two 
countries share a landscape where water is as important to national survival as 
armies. The agreement to share the resources of the Yarmouk, which borders 
Israel, Jordan and Syria, addresses an issue that has always defied resolution. 
Beyond its practical value, it symbolically seals plans for peaceful 
cooperation between the two countries in coming decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost certainly this would have been impossible if Jordan had not earlier cut 
itself free from the political burden of the West Bank. Its unilateral 
incorporation of that territory in 1950 was an assertion of legal ties over a 
land -- and a people -- whose separateness and independence had been intended 
by the United Nations when it approved the partition of Palestine into a Jewish 
and an Arab state. The subsequent failed Arab war to wipe out Israel left 
Jordan in control of the West Bank and Egypt in control of Gaza, none of whose 
inhabitants had any say in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel took over the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 War. Six years ago, King 
Hussein announced that Jordan's claim over the West Bank -- which had never 
been recognized internationally -- was dissolved. The wisdom of that decision 
has been validated. Now it's up to the Palestinians to negotiate with Israel on 
their own behalf over territory and sovereignty, as Egypt did earlier and as 
Syria has been invited to do. Had the old Arab insistence on unanimity and a 
"comprehensive" approach to Middle East peace prevailed, clearly none of this 
would be possible. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who is expected to attend next week's formal signing of the 
Israel-Jordan agreement, has rightly hailed it as evidence that "moderation and 
reason are prevailing." No third country has worked harder over the decades 
than the United States in behalf of this result. No third country can feel more 
grateful for what is being achieved.

 Celebrities should give their autographs solely to charitable organizations. 
That way, some of the leeches who have forcefully attached themselves to fame 
for monetary reasons will not only, in time, drop off, but will themselves get

HEALTH-CARE WATCH; CUTTING THE COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Medical costs for California businesses are actually going down -- or at least 
not going up as fast as they were. That's good news, of course, but it's too 
early to be sure that the downward trend will hold.Certainly the hold-down in 
no way negates the need for national health-care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 California firms are doing some of what needs to be done: becoming tougher 
bargainers with insurers, hospitals and doctors to make sure that companies and 
employees get their money's worth. Firms throughout the state have pushed costs 
downward mainly through increased use of "managed care" networks, including 
health-maintenance organizations, or HMOs. The city of Sacramento, for example, 
managed to get a 22% rollback on rates for its 4,000 employees. That's good. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are limits to how much fat one can squeeze out of the system; most 
Californians certainly don't want lower rates to translate into 
bargain-basement medical care. And, no matter how well California does in 
better managing its health-care costs, it's just one of 50 states. It must 
compete in a national market in recruiting doctors, purchasing equipment and 
buying prescription drugs. So there's no getting around the fact that 
California's reforms need national support if we want to make sure that the 
state's reforms stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington should take note that California's medical prices in the consumer 
price index are rising at a slower pace than the nation as a whole. Then 
Capitol Hill must find ways to build on this success and encourage what works, 
not reinvent the wheel.

He's just an empty suit.You say you have heard this for two years now, but 
wait, I am not talking about Bill and Hill. This is what's now being said about 
Mike and Arianna Huffington. One noticeable difference is that Mike makes it 
clear he is the candidate not his wife, but Bill boasted "vote for one, get one 
free."

her husband's senatorial campaign are appropriate, considering that the 
"traditional value" of quiet, stay-at-home wives belongs to the Republican 
Party. We know this from two years of their attacks against Hillary Clinton for 
being an independent and outspoken wife of the President. And can you imagine 
if Hillary had involvement in new age religious groups on her resume? The 
hypocrisy in this case belongs to the Republicans.

ROOTS OF HOMELESSNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apparently, Americans aren't the only ones lacking a true understanding of the 
homeless ("Gimme Shelter: The Plight of the Homeless in Lands of Plenty," World 
Report, Oct. 4). While more housing may alleviate homelessness in developing 
and formerly communist countries, housing won't cure the underlying causes of 
homelessness in the West -- substance abuse, a lack of job skills and a 
shattered self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 In a landmark 1992 Gallup/Los Angeles Mission survey, the homeless themselves 
called overwhelmingly for more job training and drug treatment programs, not 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cause, the best insurance for helping people in the U.S. and 
other Western nations to stay off the streets permanently is long-term 
rehabilitation. Teaching people to live productive lives is a lot more 
effective than hiding behind shortsighted solutions like masses of low-income 
housing. Rehabilitation is the one solution that really works.

SEXUAL EFFECTS OF POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Sexual Confusion in the Wild" (Oct. 2) was one of the finest articles I have 
ever read on the environment. Informative and terrifying, it uncovered a great 
darkness that I feel dwells deep beneath what we humans perceive as reality. I 
wept when I read it. 
</P>
<P>
 I put it on the bulletin board at my workplace. There it remained for three 
days. I attached a note and my name asking for it to be returned in case it was 
judged inappropriate. Today I found it torn off the board and crushed into a 
ball in the trash. It was an angry and ugly statement. I was shocked by the 
violence of it and was reminded of swastikas painted on synagogues in the 
middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 After pondering the issue, trying to reason it out, it occurred to me that 
there are many in our world who do not want to know the truth about man's 
destructive march across our magnificent planet. There are many who want to 
stay uninformed and complacent, hanging on to comfort and economic security no 
matter what the price. 
</P>

 Before the average modern person of reproductive age freaks out, consider

low sperm counts, breast cancer and, most disturbing, "retard(ed) penis growth" 
show up in nature with overpopulation. Also consider the parents' pot smoking, 
use of designer drugs, alcohol, casual sex and a Clinton-type diet. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's world common sense, morality, political integrity, or lack of same, 
will be the hope or horror of the near future. Perhaps these scientists would

PROP. 186 'UNKNOWNS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times, in its editorial urging a "no" vote for Proposition 186 (Oct. 9), 
supports its position by discussing "the unknown" and "the known." 
</P>
<P>
 As an "unknown," the editorial expresses concerns about the fact that this is 
an untested single-state program, unlike Canada where all provinces 
participate. In fact, Canada's single-payer system did begin in a single 
province, and, because of its overwhelming success, was eventually adopted in 
every province. The second "unknown" expressed was that the federal government 
would have to provide Medicare and Medicaid funding to the state to accomplish 
this. Although federal health care reform was not accomplished this year, the 
debate revealed that Congress would be quite willing to allow the states to use 
this funding in establishing their own programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The third "unknown" was that funding would be limited in lean economic years. 
Why shouldn't the health care sector be required to tighten its belt in those 
lean years, just as everyone else must? Quality care can be rendered without a 
fleet of luxury automobiles in every physician's garage. 
</P>
<P>
 As a "known," The Times criticizes the fact that this system would be headed 
by an elected health commissioner. We certainly expect our state to be led by 
an effective elected governor. We would expect any major corporation to be 
headed by an effective CEO. We should expect no less for our single-payer 
health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times asks if California should be a guinea pig. For the past decade, the 
California health care system has been a guinea pig, testing whether the 
insurance industry, with its managed-care subsidiaries, could bring costs under 
control while providing universal access. The guinea pig died! Costs are out of 
control, and access is even more impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-payer concept has been proven in Canada. It does control costs, and 
it does provide universal access. Proposition 186 uses this concept, but adds 
even more measures to be sure that it will meet the needs of the citizens of 
California.  
</P>
<P>
 DON R. McCANNE MD 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 * Saskatchewan was the first province in Canada to try the single-payer health 
plan. It was so successful that the rest of Canada adopted single payer! 
California should lead the way in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 MAJORIE B. LUX 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Palisades 
</P>
<P>
 * Your editorial was rather far off the mark. California as guinea pig? Don't 
be silly! Universal health care is provided in every industrialized country 
throughout the world except the U.S. and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the U.S. Congress to take any action this year gives California 
a chance to show its true leadership qualities once again by establishing a 
single-payer health care system with universal coverage for all legal 
residents. Vote yes on Proposition 186.

 * If Proposition 186, the California Health Security Act, were voted in, then 
at least I could vote out the "powerful statewide elected official, the health 
commissioner," if he isn't doing his job. I wish I had some voting power over 
the powerful administrators of all those insurance companies who are paid 
multimillions of dollars -- especially the one who runs the insurance company 
that also holds my annuity account.

 To no one's surprise, much of Friday's debate between Gov. Pete Wilson and 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown centered on crime. Since the difference between the 
gubernatorial candidates' crime platforms could easily fit through the eye of a 
needle, it was difficult for either of them to stake out any meaningful 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Brown has little by way of a record on crime -- except for having sold 
more prison bonds than any state treasurer in the history of America -- her 
opponent quickly steered the conversation to the records of her brother, Jerry, 
and father, Pat, both former governors. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Brown's name in particular sends shivers down the spines of his sister's 
campaign staff when it comes to the crime issue. Wilson's political consultants 
clearly feel that allusions to Jerry Brown need no explanation to crime-weary 
voters: Brown equals more crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as is often the case in political campaigns, facts as they relate to 
crime rates, incarceration rates and gubernatorial toughness do not match the 
mythology. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, while it is true that the incarceration rate fell by 19% in 1975, 
the second year of Jerry Brown's Administration, the crime rate nonetheless 
also dropped during the next two years.  
</P>
<P>
 The only other governor under whom incarceration declined during the past 
three decades was Ronald Reagan. Believing that the prison system was costly 
and ineffective, Reagan told his parole board to substantially reduce the 
prison population, much in the same way he cleared out the state's psychiatric 
hospitals. When the parole board was finished, the prison population had 
dropped by a whopping 30% over a three-year period. Today, that would be the 
equivalent of releasing 38,000 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 During their respective eight years as governor, the incarceration rate fell 
by 19% under Reagan; it increased by 19% under Brown and 132% under George 
Deukmejian. The violent-crime rate when Reagan left office was 602 per 100,000. 
At the end of Brown's term, it was 821 per 100,000, and by the end of 
Deukmejian's term, it was up again to 1,055 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the incarceration rate has risen 25% under Pete Wilson, violent crime 
also has increased in the first three years of his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 With a violent crime rate of 1,059 per 100,000, California has achieved the 
dubious distinction of having both the highest rate of violent crime and the 
highest incarceration rate in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate at which Californians are victims of violent crime under Wilson 
represents a 29% increase over the rate at which they were victims under Jerry 
Brown. If, for example, Californians during Wilson's Administration had been 
murdered at the rate they were when Brown was governor, 508 fewer of them would 
have lost their lives last year and 97,469 fewer of them would have fallen 
victim to violent crime overall. This despite the fact that we have nearly four 
times as many people in California prisons today as we did when Jerry Brown 
left office. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been said, "If all I had was a hammer, all my problems would look like 
nails." Unfortunately, the "nails" of unemployment, inadequate education and 
inequality of opportunity do not respond particularly well to the "hammer" of 
incarceration. That's why governors of liberal and conservative stripes alike 
have found prisons to be a woefully ineffective means by which to control 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Californians should evaluate their governors not by how many citizens 
they incarcerate, but by how few victims are left in their wake.

PERSPECTIVE ON MIDEAST PEACE; DASHED EXPECTATIONS BREED ANGER; ISRAELI 
OBSTRUCTION OF TANGIBLE BENEFITS MAKES THE CONTAINMENT OF PALESTINIAN RADICALS 
EVER MORE DIFFICULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAOUD KUTTAB, Daoud Kuttab is a Palestinian journalist and the president of 
the Jerusalem Film Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The latest tragic confrontations between Palestinians and Israelis reflect a 
major regression in the pursuit of a Middle East peace and they show that it 
will be some time before we can get rid of old thinking in handling these 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is important to condemn the actions of the Islamic Hamas movement, it 
would be a mistake to simply consider the shooting attack in a crowded Israeli 
area of Jerusalem and the kidnaping of an Israeli soldier the acts of a radical 
anti-peace movement. These actions did not take place in a vacuum. The 
atmosphere in the Palestinian community is full of frustration with the peace 
process. People feel a sense of helplessness as a result of the terrible delay 
in attaining a genuine peace. It was three years ago that Palestinians in 
Ramallah waved olive branches at Israeli soldiers. Last week, not far from 
Ramallah, we saw evidence of the frustration felt by Palestinians who have yet 
to see the fruits of the widely acclaimed peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Reasons for these dashed hopes are many. More than 7,000 Palestinian political 
and security prisoners still remain in jail; they don't understand how their 
leader has been forgiven, yet they have been left to rot. Homes of the few 
thousands prisoners who were released are still sealed; an attempt to reopen 
them was met with Israeli resealing. The siege on Jerusalem continues; Israeli 
plans to further Judaize the Holy City have not eased. The promise of Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin to freeze settlements has not been honored; new 
settlements are being built and thousands of acres of Palestinian land have 
been confiscated just in the past year. Rabin has said that dates (signed to in 
the agreement) are not sacred. Israel has not fulfilled even simple promises 
agreed upon in the declaration of principles, such as turning over to the 
Palestinians administrative control of border points, or permitting safe 
passage between Palestinian Gaza and Jericho. The Palestinians still have not 
received population records. Even releasing a frequency for a television 
station has not been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the debate, of course, is focused on the militant Hamas movement. 
Israeli leaders say that PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat is responsible for the 
actions of all Palestinians since he signed an agreement as their 
representative. That is fair. But then the Israelis refuse to release any Hamas 
prisoners (including the paraplegic spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin). They 
want to veto the right of Hamas supporters to participate in elections of the 
self-rule council. Furthermore, Rabin wants the Palestinian leadership to 
choose between Hamas or peace. Did Rabin present such a choice to Jewish 
settlers after one of their own committed the massacre in the mosque at Hebron? 
No. But now Israel will demand and carry out punitive measures against Hamas; 
this will infuriate Palestinians and the cycle of violence will widen. The fact 
is that just as Palestinians must accept all Israelis -- right-wing and 
left-wing, peaceniks and militants, Israel has to do the same with the 
Palestinians. To attempt to differentiate or to ask one side to discriminate is 
simply a formula for trouble and internal strife. This is not to say that the 
PLO doesn't have an obligation to keep Hamas in check, just as Israel has a 
similar obligation toward militant settlers. But to hold the entire peace 
process to the dictates of Israeli security officials who seem unable to fathom 
the real meaning of peace is totally counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian-Israeli peace process has, in essence, trapped the leaders of 
both nations; any agreement that is bad for one side will be bad for the other 
side. This is good. But attempts at one-sided and military solutions work 
against progress. Israeli negotiators and military officials have been using 
their clear edge over the Palestinians to extract humiliating concessions while 
giving up very little in substance. This has played into the hands of radicals. 
 
</P>
<P>
 New thinking is needed. Both the kidnaping of an Israeli soldier and the 
army's attempt to rescue him reflect old thinking of solving problems 
militarily. If our mutual aim is a lasting peace and not simply a temporary 
cease-fire, we need to deal with problems with new thinking, as hard and 
difficult as it may seem. This means that both sides have to work extra hard to 
improve public support for the peace process. As it stands, what Palestinians 
can do for Israelis is intangible; they need to reassure Israelis of their 
commitment to peace. The tangibles needed from Israel have to do with land, 
water, releasing prisoners and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 Former U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III made a major part of his 
strategy the need for confidence building. Until now, little has been done in 
this regard. Yet building confidence between both sides is the road to dealing 
with the root of the problem and not just its tragic symptoms.

COLUMN RIGHT/ MICKEY EDWARDS: COMMON CAUSE SHOULD TURN TO GRASS ROOTS; 
CAMPAIGN-SPENDING REFORM HAS LESS CHANCE IN THE NEXT CONGRESS, BUT THE 
ELECTORATE CAN BE ENERGIZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICKEY EDWARDS, Mickey Edwards, chairman of the House Republican Policy 
Committee before leaving Congress in 1992, is teaching at the John F. Kennedy 
School of Government and writing a column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 24 years at Common Cause, the past 14 as its president, Fred Wertheimer 
has decided to call it quits. Perhaps there will be a retirement party, a gold 
watch, a plaque for his wall. What he wants most, though, he won't get. 
</P>
<P>
 Common Cause considers itself a watchdog of sorts, and although its efforts 
sometimes seem to coincide a little too neatly with the Democratic agenda, it 
has also been remarkably effective at drawing public attention to serious 
deficiencies in the American political system. It is possible to raise a 
bemused eyebrow about some of the organization's proposed solutions, but the 
fact is, Common Cause, under Wertheimer's leadership, has done yeoman service 
in pointing to the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 What Wertheimer wants most, at this point, is legislation changing the way 
congressional campaigns are financed. But Congress has gone home without 
acting, and now Wertheimer, too, is going home. His successor will get a chance 
to try again in the next Congress, but Republicans, who have very different 
ideas about how campaign finance laws ought to be changed, will be in a much 
stronger position then. 
</P>
<P>
 With a long record of success, however, Common Cause should not quit now. 
During the past 20 years, the organization has helped to end special-interest 
payments to congressmen in the form of speaking fees and has been a driving 
force behind a number of high-profile ethics investigations. The current system 
of financing campaigns is sorely in need of overhaul, and Common Cause, with 
its strong grass-roots lobbying arm, can play an important role in forcing 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 One important step would be for the organization to renew its commitment to 
its primary goal -- reducing the impact of special interests on the election 
process -- while reassessing how to get there. In recent years, Common Cause 
has focused on two specific proposals: federal financing of congressional 
elections and limits on total campaign spending. The goals are laudable but the 
legislation is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican opposition to federal financing is deep-seated and unlikely to 
change. That is partly because Republicans have had more success in raising 
money from individual contributors. But there are other objections as well: For 
one thing, I don't want my tax dollars used to elect a David Duke or an Oliver 
North. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who advocate taxpayer funding of elections begin with the premise that 
private contributions to campaigns are somehow tainted. But our greatest 
political problem is not excess participation but citizen apathy. We should be 
encouraging citizens to participate by seeking office, volunteering on 
campaigns and contributing to candidates who share their views. The evil is not 
in the individual contribution but in the ability of the wealthy to put so much 
money into a campaign that they can determine the outcome, a danger that was 
effectively eliminated by the adoption of strict contribution limits (no 
individual may donate more than $1,000 per election to any candidate). 
</P>
<P>
 Limits on total campaign spending, if not matched by limits on the cost of 
campaigning -- advertising, postage, printing -- will merely reduce the ability 
of candidates to get their messages to the voters. The result will be an 
uninformed electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of choking off participation and debate, Common Cause should 
concentrate on increasing the role of the ordinary citizen. One way to do this 
is by restricting contributions by special-interest political action committees 
to $1,000 per election cycle, instead of the current $5,000, and restoring tax 
write-offs of up to $200 for contributions by individuals. More individuals 
will participate, while large-scale contributors will have an incentive to 
limit donations to the amount of the tax credit. 
</P>
<P>
 To increase responsiveness to constituents, campaign laws should require 
congressional candidates to raise at least half of their funds from individuals 
who live within the district, reducing the influence of out-of-state interest 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Common Cause should explore means of increasing the number of public 
debates and cost-free outlets for the dissemination of campaign platforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Wertheimer has led Common Cause to significant victories, but his 
departure opens the door for new approaches. In less than 90 days, a new 
Congress will take office. Now is the time for Common Cause to re-examine its 
strategies. If it accepts new means of achieving its goals, it may yet lead the 
way to serious election reform. And while it may not come in the form he 
envisioned, it will be reform that owes its passage to 24 years of Wertheimer 
persistence. And that beats a gold watch any day.

 OPEN SEASON: The gates of the Audubon Society's Starr Ranch Sanctuary swing 
open to the public for the first time Oct. 29. The 4,000-acre wilderness 
preserve near Coto de Caza has been seen only by wildlife researchers and 
Audubon members since being donated to the environmental group in 1973. . . . 
More than just a chance to see its research work, says spokesman Ken Fortune: 
"This is a rare 'before' look at Orange County, before all the development 
came." . . . Naturalists will lead free tours but reservations are required. 
</P>

 SIGN LANGUAGE: The Border Patrol checkpoint near San Clemente has been closed 
for more than two weeks, but a large yellow sign -- with flashing lights -- 
over I-5 still warns northbound motorists that they must stop in one mile. . . 
. Border Patrol spokeswoman Ann Summers says state officials have been told and 
they should have the flashing sign taken down soon.

 JILL'S LAW: Nothing funny about breast cancer, but those close to the subject 
can have fun while getting their message out. High Priority in Newport Beach, a

. . . It's called "Nothing but the Truth." Reason: Guest speakers are Jill 
Eikenberry, above, and husband Michael Tucker. They'll talk about their careers 
on TV's "L.A. Law" as well as Eikenberry's battle with breast cancer in the 
1980s.

 DOWN AND DIRTY: Homeowners in a hurry to have their quake-damaged chimneys 
ready for St. Nick's visit in two months are finding that the black soot is 
leaving them in the red. Repairs delayed since the January temblor cost as much

 GRAY MATTER: Teaching is old hat to many of the instructors in Los Angeles' 
community colleges. Too old, apparently, for college district leaders. 
Officials may soon offer early retirement to the district's 700 eldest

 THE JET SET: The Cold War might be over, but experts say Lockheed Corp. can 
always count on acrimony between Greece and Turkey. The two foreign countries 
are among 17 that have bought F-16 fighter jets since 1978, and overseas sales 
now account for most of the Calabasas company's sales of the airplane. The U.S.

 FASHION: Click, click go the cameras in Paris as French designers show their 
1995 collections (E1) . . . But if Valley shoppers want haute couture , their 
high heels will also have to go click, click -- because the clothes are scarce 
here. "We have things inspired by the runway pieces, but not those actual 
pieces" says Ann Delmuro, manager of Studio City's Jona boutique. But where to 
go? Beverly Hills or South Coast Plaza, say the experts. Jon D. Markman

REPORT SAYS SCAT SHOULD SCOOT IF OPERATING EXPENSES AREN'T CUT; TRANSPORTATION: 
CITY IS URGED TO START OWN BUS SYSTEM OR HIRE A PRIVATE FIRM IF SOUTH COAST 
AREA TRANSIT FAILS TO REDUCE ITS BUDGET. 
</P>

<P>
 Oxnard should consider firing South Coast Area Transit and starting a city-run 
bus system or hiring a private transit service if SCAT does not reduce its 
operating budget, a city report has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Councilman Michael A. Plisky, who thinks Oxnard spends too 
much on public transit, the city's Traffic Department has prepared a report 
analyzing the fiscal efficiency of SCAT, which has provided bus service to the 
city for 20 years.  
</P>
<P>
 The report concludes that Oxnard should explore alternatives to SCAT -- which 
gets about 45% of its local funding from Oxnard -- or press the bus agency to 
cut expenses.  
</P>
<P>
 "I believe there is room for dramatic improvement, one way or another," Plisky 
said. "I don't think they're concentrating on efficiency as much as they need 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 SCAT, a joint-powers authority formed in 1973, annually carries nearly 3 
million passengers in Ventura, Port Hueneme, Ojai, Oxnard and unincorporated 
parts of Ventura County. About 40% of those come from Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard contributed $1.4 million to this year's SCAT budget of $6 million. 
About $3.2 million of the $6 million comes from the cities and the county, and 
the rest comes directly from state and federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus agency provides eight routes through the city, three of which go into 
Port Hueneme, Ventura County or Ventura, for a total of 572,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, scheduled to be presented today to the Oxnard City Council, 
recommends that the council either: 
</P>
<P>
 * Analyze how much it would cost to have bus service provided by a private 
company, the city or agencies other than SCAT. 
</P>
<P>
 * Draft a letter to SCAT requesting that it establish a committee made up of 
bus agency staff and representatives of all the member cities to prepare a 
cost-cutting plan by March.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, who also serves as vice president of SCAT's board 
of directors, said the agency may need to cut bus lines throughout Ventura 
County to reduce its budget and appease the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Oxnard to get rid of SCAT altogether would be a major mistake for 
Oxnard, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should look at what we have and look at how we can modify it," 
Lopez said. "I think privatizing is a bit far-fetched. I think it would present 
a lot of problems."  
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo and Thousand Oaks both have private bus services, while Simi Valley 
runs its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Oxnard has paid its share of the SCAT budget with state and federal 
funding. But if SCAT's budget forecast is correct, the city will have to 
provide $44,000 of its own funds in 1995-96 to cover rising costs. By 1998, it 
would have to pay $348,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky thinks SCAT should be more responsive to the budgetary constraints of 
its members. 
</P>
<P>
 "SCAT, like many of these kinds of agencies that don't report directly to the 
voters, thinks there is a bottomless pit of money available to them," Plisky 
said. "They concentrate on getting more money instead of getting more 
efficient."  
</P>
<P>
 The report compares the cost of SCAT per mile and hours of operation to bus 
services in Camarillo, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, as well as the Los 
Angeles-Foothill Transit Zone and the Livermore/Amador Valley Transit 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SCAT costs considerably more than the services in Camarillo and Thousand Oaks, 
which contract with outside firms for public transit, and Simi Valley, which 
hires its own drivers and provides its own maintenance, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 But SCAT is slightly cheaper than the other transit authorities, which provide 
a more valid comparison, said Maureen Hooper Lopez, SCAT's director of planning 
and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Lopez said bus service cannot be treated as a business, like other city 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public transit never pays for itself," Lopez said. "Sometimes you think it 
would be cheaper just to hire a taxi for everyone."

HOME SALES STILL STRONG DESPITE A SEASONAL LAG; HOUSING: REPORT SAYS THE 
COUNTY'S HOUSING MARKET IN SEPTEMBER SHOWED A 9.3% IMPROVEMENT OVER THE 
PREVIOUS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Despite a slight lag after a summer boom, Ventura County's September house 
sales were up 9.3% over the same period last year, with the most dramatic 
increases in Moorpark, Ventura and Thousand Oaks, according to a report 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A steady decrease in prices continues to encourage first-time buyers and has 
kept the market healthy, according to Nima Nattagh, an analyst with TRW-REDI 
Property Data. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, 869 homes were sold countywide, a jump of 74 from September, 1993. 
But sales had been much stronger over the summer as 982 houses changed hands in 
August alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has definitely been a slowdown," Nattagh said. "But I think it is due 
to the fact that we had an exceptionally good second quarter and that sales are 
seasonal in nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Local real estate agents said they have come to expect such back-to-school 
slowdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, the market does tend to slow down in the fall," said Mary Leydon, 
a Coldwell Banker agent who sells property in Moorpark. "Most people like to 
correlate their move with the school year." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she had prepared for a September lull, Leydon and other Moorpark real 
estate agents were unexpectedly busy during the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly sales in Moorpark nearly doubled, up from 41 houses a year ago to 72 
last month. And unlike most cities, prices in Moorpark actually increased -- 
from $237,244 in 1993 to $244,302 last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is thriving in Moorpark," Leydon said. "I think a lot of the 
companies transferring employees into this area must have put it onto their 
lists of good places to live. A number of buyers have mentioned that to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lower prices continue to draw buyers from the San Fernando Valley and Los 
Angeles, particularly to less expensive areas of Ventura, Simi Valley and 
Oxnard, agents said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the average Ventura County house sold for $235,241, prices in eastern 
Simi Valley were much lower, averaging about $187,000. In Oxnard, the average 
price of houses away from the beach -- where 80% of all homes sold -- ranged 
from $151,000 to $180,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Houses in more expensive areas were less likely to sell quickly in the 
bargain-driven market, according to the report. In Oak Park, where the average 
home price was $274,412, 36 houses were sold during September, the same number 
as the previous September. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of an increasingly stable market, Nattagh said, is the lack of 
bargains from foreclosure. While some foreclosed real estate is still available 
-- leftovers from the recession -- it is priced much closer to market value, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Hoag, president of the Ventura Assn. of Realtors, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not seeing the numbers of foreclosures that we saw at one point," Hoag 
said. "They are not the bargains that they were at all. Back in the beginning, 
it seemed like the banks were dropping them to get rid of them. But they're not 
doing it any longer. Prices are at market in most cases, or close to."  
</P>
<P>
 Experts disagreed on how much rising mortgage interest rates have affected the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the increase in interest rates has been large enough or for 
long enough to adversely impact the market," Nattagh said. "And historically 
speaking, the rates are still low."  
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage rates have jumped from about 7% for a 30-year mortgage a year ago to 
about 9% today. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrine MacDougall, an agent with Bob Ely Realty in Moorpark, said she thinks 
rising interest rates may be keeping buyers out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business has slowed in the last month," MacDougall said. "I think that is due 
to the rise in interest rates. We usually have a drop-off when school starts, 
then we pick up Oct. 1. But it hasn't picked up this year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoag said she thinks first-time buyers may be jumping into the market now 
out of fear that rates will rise even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's at least partially accountable for the market," Hoag said.  
</P>
<P>
 From her point of view, the market has leveled off. Prices are relatively 
stable, there are plenty of buyers and even the weather is cooperating, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look outside, it's pretty nice weather," Hoag said. "I think people 
are finding us. Ventura is doing very well. It seems like a healthy market to 
me." Home Sales Statistics 05,15,12,12,12,12 Sept. 1994 Sept. 1993 ZIP Code No.

LAWYERS IMPROPERLY GOT MERIT RAISES, COUNTY ATTORNEY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As many as two dozen county prosecutors and public defenders have been able to 
circumvent a countywide pay-freeze plan and received improper merit raises, the 
attorney for the Ventura County Board of Supervisors concluded Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that promises to spark controversy between county administrators and 
the lawyers who keep the local justice system running, auditors will be 
instructed today to revoke the raises given to the 18 deputy district attorneys 
and seven deputy public defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it fair for all other county employees . . . to not have raises and have 
the attorneys still getting them?" asked County Personnel Director Ronald W. 
Komers. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, the board voted to deny merit raises to more than half the 
county's 6,000 employees, including those public defenders and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the employees affected were relatively new hires who had not yet 
reached the top of their pay scale and were thus eligible for step increases, 
paid for each additional year of service. 
</P>
<P>
 In its bid to save about $3.23 million, the board voted 3 to 1 to delay those 
yearly pay raises from July, 1993, until this July. Under the plan, no one 
would receive merit raises for that one-year period until after 1995, Komers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When that pay freeze expired in July, the prosecutors and public defenders 
were not only granted this year's step increase, but in many cases received 
raises for the year their pay was frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 An error in the way those forms were processed resulted in at least some 
lawyers getting the full raises their bosses requested for them, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fairness is the major issue, as far as I'm concerned," the personnel director 
said, noting that other county employees are not receiving raises for the year 
that the pay freeze was in effect. "Our goal is to save $3.2 million, and we 
indicated in front of the board that it would take two years to recover that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday's legal opinion that the raises were improper, written by Deputy 
County Counsel Leroy Smith, did not sit well with those affected by its 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still believe we have the ability to bump those people to where they would 
have been if it were not for that freeze," argued Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Kevin J. McGee, who said as many as 18 of his prosecutors received such raises. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the public defenders affected by Monday's ruling said he felt betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that I've been cheated is what it amounts to," groused Deputy Public 
Defender Bruce N. Freed. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed's case is representative of the situation of many of those who are 
facing pay cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 He was being paid as a public defender with 4 1/2 years experience when the 
freeze took effect in July, 1993. At the time, he was only weeks away from 
earning pay as an attorney with five full years of service to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Freed finished his sixth year as a public defender shortly after the 
pay freeze was lifted in July, his bosses rewarded him by raising his pay to 
the level of a six-year attorney. A public defender or prosecutor with six 
years experience typically makes about $69,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, his pay will have to be reconfigured, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this, of course, sits well with Freed, who said he bought a home with 
the expectation that his county salary would grow relative to his experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us left other jobs because working for the county, the one thing you 
can count on is security," he said. "Now, they may want me to return money to 
them having done nothing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Komers said Freed and others never should have received raises for any of the 
period covering the freeze. He said that because they are not part of the 
county's regular employees unions, their paperwork was mistakenly processed 
differently and raises were approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The paperwork looks differently for the attorneys than for regular 
employees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Komers said he will ask Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon to revoke the 
improper raises today and roll back the lawyers' pay to where it is supposed to 
be.

ELECTIONS / PROP. 187; OFFICIALS SEE HEALTH RISKS IN MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County public health officials on Monday denounced a statewide ballot 
initiative that would bar most health care to illegal immigrants, calling it a 
reckless measure that could lead to epidemics of communicable diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't have the tools to deal with those people who are ill, we're not 
going to be able to protect anybody's health," said Dr. Gary Feldman, the 
county's public health officer. "The result is that we all suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, which has become the center of an increasingly heated public 
debate, would leave people more vulnerable to the spread of AIDS, tuberculosis, 
measles, hepatitis and other infectious diseases, Feldman warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "These diseases don't ask anyone whether they're a legal resident or whether 
they have a green card," Feldman said during a news conference at the County 
Government Center in Ventura. "Whomever they infect can transmit that illness 
throughout the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the measure said that illegal immigration continues to be 
one of the major problems facing the state, and pointed out that opinion polls 
show voters favoring Proposition 187 by as much as 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect all the usual suspects to come out and scream and pound their 
chests" against Proposition 187, said Steve Frank, coordinator of the Ventura 
County campaign in support of the measure. "But real people, the voters who are 
paying the bills, are not buying this gobbledygook. They're saying, 'If 
politicians won't take action, then we will.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to non-emergency health care, Proposition 187 would also bar 
education and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 With such a strong showing of public support for the measure, immigrant 
activists and local government and school officials have begun their own 
campaigns to oppose the ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors, the county Board of Education and 
school boards in Oxnard and Ventura have all passed resolutions opposing 
Proposition 187. The board of the Simi Valley Unified School District will 
discuss the issue at its meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 And last week, hundreds of opponents of the initiative marched through the 
streets of Ventura to urge defeat of the ballot measure. A similar 
demonstration in Los Angeles on Sunday drew 70,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman and other county officials said Monday that their primary concern is 
the effect that Proposition 187 would have on public health, particularly in 
preventing children from being immunized against polio, measles and other 
transmittable diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real step backwards," said Dr. Barbara Thorpe, chairwoman of the 
county's Public Health Community Advisory Board. "It's a regressive step for an 
enlightened society." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thorpe added that it is much cheaper to prevent the spread of diseases, rather 
than to treat those who are already infected. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're really doing is deferring the cost," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Feldman and Thorpe at Monday's news conference were school nurse Linda 
Butcher, who is also a member of the county's Public Health Community Advisory 
Board, and county Supervisor John K. Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the officials agreed that something must be done to stem the tide of 
illegal immigration, but that Proposition 187 is not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should be legislating problems with immigration at our borders and 
not in our neighborhoods and communities," Butcher said.

 Believing that minors should not be exposed to sexually explicit magazines 
while patronizing convenience stores, the Camarillo City Council has voted to 
require shopkeepers to place covers over racks holding those publications. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously Wednesday to change the city's zoning law to 
require the installation of so-called blinders over the racks holding sexually 
explicit material. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment must return to the council at its Nov. 2 meeting for final 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's meeting, Councilman David Smith told a group of supporters 
of the rack restrictions that although the zoning change would help screen the 
overtly explicit publications from the view of children, it might not serve to 
block certain magazines that, for instance, carry a cover photograph of a man 
or woman wearing bathing attire or lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other words, I want you to know this (amendment) will have limits," Smith 
said. "It may not do all that you want it to do." J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY OKS 1ST STEPS TOWARD RIVER TRAIL

<P>
 The construction of a bike, horse and hiking trail along old railroad tracks 
moved a step forward Monday when the Ventura City Council approved preliminary 
funding for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with the county and the cities of Fillmore and Santa Paula, Ventura 
plans to purchase 37.8 miles of right of way from Southern Pacific 
Transportation Co.Before the county stepped in last year, the railroad company 
was selling off its property piecemeal to various buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies will use $7.2 million in federal funding to buy the land. In 
addition, Ventura has cobbled together $1.75 million in federal and state 
grants for creation of a 5.8-mile section of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 That trail, to be called the Ventura River Trail, will link the existing Ojai 
Valley Trail and the beachfront Omer Rains Trail. When Fillmore and Santa Paula 
can assemble the funds, they also plan to construct trails along a 32-mile 
stretch running from Montalvo to Piru.  
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, the Ventura City Council approved $50,000 to be spent on 
appraisals, title costs and legal costs associated with the purchase of the 
right of way. Officials say the city will be reimbursed with federal funds once 
the initial purchasing steps are completed. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NYELAND ACRES; TRAILER PARK BLAZE LEAVES 12 HOMELESS 
</P>

<P>
 A dozen Nyeland Acres residents were left homeless Monday after an unemployed 
mechanic working on his van started a fire that destroyed his mobile home and 
severely damaged his mother's next door, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire started at 12:43 p.m. at Sunshine Manor, a row of mobile homes that 
fronts 2725 E. Ventura Blvd. just north of Oxnard, county fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which caused about $43,000 in damages and consumed the clothing, 
toys and other possessions of a family of five, was extinguished in about 30 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Two passing sheriff's deputies used garden hoses to help keep the fire from 
spreading beyond the two mobile homes, Fire Department spokeswoman Sandi Wells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Salcedo Ruiz, 32, his hands and face smudged from soot and engine grease, 
said he was trying to start his van after replacing its spark plugs when the 
engine burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing just paces from his gutted home, Ruiz recalled how the flames lit the 
plastic awning that shaded his van and then grew to 30 feet as they consumed 
the uninsured structure of wood and aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Maria, 26, was at the doctor's office at the time with their three 
children -- David, 7; Esteban, 5, and Stephanie, 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz's mother, Edlimira Salcedo, 57, lived in the heavily damaged mobile home 
next door with two of his brothers, two nieces, a daughter-in-law and a 
babysitter, Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze caused minor burns to two firefighters. Fire Capt. Ranger Dorn, 37, 
whose engine company was the first to arrive, said a buckle on his chin strap 
grew so hot that it left a nickle-size, second-degree burn on his left cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 He was treated at St. John's Regional Medical Center, as was Engineer Ray 
Ruiz, who suffered first degree burns, Dorn said. GREG RIPPEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FEES FOR SERVICES TO BE CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County could soon begin charging fees to monitor rent in mobile home 
parks, answer questions from the public over the telephone and research queries 
about illegal land divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fee proposals are among several being considered to replace subsidies 
and reduce the county Resource Management Agency's budget by $517,000.The 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors is expected to vote on the measures today.  
</P>
<P>
 To make up for the $50,000 cost of administering the mobile home rent review 
program, Thomas Berg, director of the Resource Management Agency, has proposed 
charging park owners $3 per space per month. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg's other proposals include billing two water districts $18,000 for a 
public education program teaching conservation and increasing the cost of 
permits issued to companies that film movies in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to proposing eight immediate changes, Berg also gave the 
supervisors a long-term list of ideas for saving money. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the suggestions was setting specific fines for violating building code 
regulations and instituting a 900 phone number that would charge residents who 
call the agency seeking information. 
</P>
<P>
 If the cuts are not made, 12 positions will be eliminated from the Resource 
Management Agency, which includes planning, environmental health and the Air 
Pollution Control District. With the implementation of fees, three positions 
would be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee said the county must charge the fees or eliminate the 
services.  
</P>
<P>
 "There simply isn't enough money to keep on doing the things we've 
traditionally done," she said. "When you cut services, you cut good things."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; FIRM HIRED TO FIGHT NAVY BASE CLOSINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Ventura County defense-industry executives and community leaders 
who are fighting the possible closure of the county's two Navy bases announced 
Monday that a Washington lobbying firm will represent them in their efforts to 
keep the facilities open. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the BRAC '95 Task Force announced that the firm of Copeland, 
Hatfield, Lowery and Jacquez will represent the group in its fight to keep the 
Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station and the Naval Construction Battalion 
Center in Port Hueneme off the federal Base Realignment and Closure list, which 
is due to be released in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobbying firm was one of seven firms interviewed for the job and will be 
awarded a contract of $240,000, said Cal Carrera, co-chairman of the BRAC '95 
Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed to present the right combination of experience and know-how in 
dealing with the BRAC process," Carrera said. "If we can get out the message of 
the military value of these bases, I think we'll have a good chance of keeping 
them open." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Carrera said that Santa Paula resident William Simmons has been 
chosen to head the task force as its administrative director. Details of his 
salary have yet to be worked out, but he is expected to lead the group through 
next spring, Carrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrera said that the task force has collected more than $175,000 in pledges 
from cities in Ventura County. The group will ask the Port Hueneme City Council 
to contribute to the campaign during its meeting tonight.  
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the city balked at contributing to the effort, saying that task 
force members had not adequately explained where their money would go in the 
fight to save the bases. J.E. MITCHELL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PASSENGER INJURED IN DUNE BUGGY 
ACCIDENT

<P>
 A Newbury Park man broke his leg and two other men escaped serious injury 
after their dune buggy overturned on a hillside while they were riding on dirt 
trails at night in west Thousand Oaks, sheriff's deputies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Spaeth, 20, was injured after the 1962 Volkswagen rolled over his leg 
about 10 p.m. Sunday, just moments after he tried to leap free from the 
vehicle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaeth, whose right leg was broken, was reported in satisfactory 
conditionMonday night at Los Robles Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the off-road vehicle, Brett Compositor, 20, of Westlake, was 
driving in the Hill Canyon area off Rancho Conejo Boulevard when the Volkswagen 
lost power and began to roll backward, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the buggy began to flip, Spaeth unfastened his seat belt and jumped while 
Compositor and another passenger, 20-year-old Brian Meany of Newbury Park, 
remained in the car, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 They said neither Compositor nor Meany, who were wearing their seat belts, 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident remained under investigation, deputies said. GREG RIPPEE

ENTREPRENEUR SHOWS MARINE CENTER SKETCHES TO COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flanked by a corps of designers and architects, a Montecito-based entrepreneur 
gave the Ventura City Council its first taste Monday of what a proposed marine 
center might look like. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Fiori, a former design professor who created the state of California's 
pavilion for Expo '86, wants to see a $20-million educational and entertainment 
center, including an aquarium, at Ventura Harbor. He envisions a public-private 
effort to finance the center. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, he brought a representative of a landscape architecture firm, who 
showed sketches for design of the grounds and the parking lot, and an architect 
with a concept for the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Cardinal, the architect commissioned to design the Smithsonian 
Institute's National Museum of the American Indian, exhibited a model showing a 
cluster of modern wave-like buildings perched on a platform, lapped by the 
ocean waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most promising and exciting opportunities since the 
university," City Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures said, referring to a failed 
proposal to construct a Cal State University campus in Ventura. "This meets a 
lot of needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiori approached the council this summer with a plan for a state-of-the-art 
facility encompassing an expanded Channel Islands National Park visitor center, 
an outdoor shipbuilding facility, indoor and outdoor aquariums, fish 
hatcheries, an Imax-Cinemax large-screen theater and a research center for 
Jean-Michel Cousteau, the son of oceanographer Jacques Cousteau. 
</P>
<P>
 The council gave him $10,000 to pursue his vision, much of which he spent on 
detailed renditions of the prospective project. But Fiori fell short of his 
promise to target potential funding sources for the center, instead sketching a 
broad vision of private businesses and nonprofit groups working with local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 At an evening study session, some council members proposed an economic study 
to determine just how marketable the proposed center would be. Since Fiori 
presented his idea to the council this summer, the city learned that Oxnard, 
Santa Barbara, San Pedro and Long Beach are also planning their own versions of 
a marine center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard facility, now the subject of a feasibility study, would be at the 
Channel Islands Harbor, just a few miles down Harbor Boulevard from the 
proposed Ventura site. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura study would examine the viability of the center and the potential 
for raising funds locally to pay for it.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; WINDOW-PRYING BURGLAR SOUGHT

<P>
 A burglar who pries open the back windows of parked vehicles apparently has 
struck twice in the same Newbury Park neighborhood, a sheriff's detective said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime between Saturday night and sunrise Sunday, someone stole stereo 
equipment, a television set and tools from three vehicles at Mirabella 
Apartments in the 1800 block of West Hillcrest Drive, Detective Tom Bennett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of three break-ins, the burglar apparently slipped in through the rear 
window of a Toyota pickup by removing the weather stripping along its top and 
sides. He then used the still-secured bottom of the window as a hinge, pulling 
the glass down toward the truck bed, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, the thief pried open a small wing window to gain access to 
1971 Dodge van. The third vehicle, a 1986 Cadillac, showed no signs of forced 
entry, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 7, deputies took reports of five other vehicle burglaries that 
occurred the previous night at the nearby Las Casitas condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said two of the thefts that night involved pickup trucks, one with its 
rear window removed and another with its window lowered in the same manner as 
at the Mirabella Apartments. One truck was missing only a box of 72 candy bars, 
he said. GREG RIPPEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SEARCH TO START FOR NEW FESTIVAL SITE

<P>
 As a Simi Valley developer prepares to build houses on a vacant lot where the 
city's annual carnival is held, the City Council on Monday agreed to begin 
searching for a new site for the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past six years, the Ferris wheels and rodeos of Simi Valley Days have 
drawn crowds to the corner of Madera Road and Los Angeles Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Expecting the land to be developed in 1989, the city formed a committee to 
look for other places to hold the annual festival. The most promising site was 
Tapo Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the recession hit and the 67-acre Madera Road lot remained vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Griffin Industries plans to build 271 houses on a portion of the property, 
and the council has agreed to convene a seven-member committee to look for 
another site. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will include one member each from the City Council, the Rancho 
Simi Parks and Recreation District, Simi Valley Days Committee, Neighborhood 
Council, a local service club and two at-large members of the public. SARA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; JUDGE RENEGES ON PROBATION PROMISE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A porn actress from Newbury Park has shown no remorse for having sex with a 
14-year-old boy, a Ventura County judge said Monday, as he reneged on his 
promise to keep the woman from going to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Arden, 45, pleaded guilty last month to four criminal counts in 
connection with the case, after Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. 
promised she would get probation for her crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Campbell told Arden he could not stick to his part of the agreement 
and allowed her until Thursday to withdraw her guilty plea -- or face a state 
prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said he changed his mind after reading statements Arden made in a 
probation report. The judge said he was particularly distressed over one 
statement in which Arden said she seduced the boy because she had pity for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I read that, I thought to myself that I had made a significant mistake 
in saying that this person ought to be placed on probation," Campbell said. "I 
can't understand how somebody could say that." 
</P>
<P>
 Arden also said in the report that the boy initiated their sexual affair.  
</P>
<P>
 She pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, 
one count of sexual penetration with a foreign object and one count of showing 
explicit photos to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden could face as many as six years in prison. DWAYNE BRAY

BOARD BRACES FOR HOT SESSION ON DRESS CODE AND BUS FEES; SIMI VALLEY: TRUSTEES 
WILL VOTE ON WHETHER TO LOWER THE NEW $300 TRANSPORTATION CHARGE AND DISCUSS 
VALLEY VIEW'S BAN ON SOME T-SHIRTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Facing a federal lawsuit and scores of angry parents, the Simi Valley school 
board will tackle two of the community's most contentious issues tonight: the 
student dress code and the new bus transportation fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-member board will vote on whether to lower a $300 fee for riding the 
school bus, a charge levied for the first time this year. They will also 
discuss one junior high school's strict dress code, now being challenged in 
U.S. District Court and criticized by parents. 
</P>
<P>
 As if that were not enough, the board expects to adopt a resolution opposing 
Proposition 187, a move some Ventura County schools districts have shied away 
from due to controversy surrounding the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would deny illegal immigrants access to public schools, 
non-emergency health care and other social services. If passed, Ventura County 
schools could lose nearly $50 million in state and federal funding, school 
officials have estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, school districts would have to spend about $6.5 million in 
administrative costs, namely verifying the immigration status of children and 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the most volatile issue before the board tonight promises to be Valley 
View Junior High School's dress code, now the subject of a federal lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Simi Valley Unified School 
District this month, alleging that the restrictive dress code violates 
students' constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed on behalf of John Spindler, a 14-year-old Valley View 
student who was sent home from school for wearing patriotic T-shirts. His 
mother, Ellen, requested that the board review the school's dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 But board members said Friday that because of pending litigation there is 
little they can say on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not sure we are going to have a lot of leeway," Trustee Diane Collins 
said. "What I think we have to do is wait for the lawsuit to play itself out." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Debbie Sandland said she wants to talk about the dress code, and hopes 
the board doesn't shy away from the subject.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am totally prepared to discuss it," she said. "My contention is that we 
should rethink it. I am going to be very disappointed if the board backs off 
this."  
</P>
<P>
 Sandland said she plans to present a letter signed by 80 parents and students 
opposing the dress code. "It says (the dress code) is too strict and it's gone 
too far."

<P>
 Although the board will not take any action regarding the dress code, parents 
and students could use the board meeting to voice their opinions, board members 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a lot of strong feeling about it and people are going to 
come out -- no question about it," said board President Carla Kurachi. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On the issue of bus fees, trustees will vote tonight on whether to lower fares 
for home-to-school transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, annual fees that start at $300 per child would be reduced to $200 
per child. The district would also begin to offer one-way bus passes and allow 
parents to pay fares on a quarterly basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board voted in June to charge for school bus service beginning this 
school year in an attempt to bring in about $190,000 for the financially 
strapped district. 
</P>
<P>
 But bus pass sales have generated only about $49,760 so far, officials said. 
By lowering the fares, district officials hope to boost bus ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you do things the first time you have to make adjustments," said Trustee 
Judy Barry, who supports the lower fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry is also pushing for a board resolution opposing Proposition 187 because 
of the potential effect on the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rationale behind it is not only the expense," Barry said. "We don't feel 
that the schools should be in the position of policing whether a child and 
their parents are citizens or not. We are in the business of education, not 
policing illegal immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins agreed. "If she wouldn't have asked for it, I would have. I think we 
need to take a position. This is a terrible proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 But board member Doug Crosse said he will oppose the resolution against 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a proponent of this (ballot measure), but the message it delivers is 
critical," he said. "To take a stand against it is to say we don't have a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the proposition a "necessary wake-up call" addressing the problems 
created by illegal immigration, Crosse said he believes the costs for schools 
will be worked out in subsequent bills.

SIMI VALLEY OKS FUNDS FOR NEW PHONE SYSTEM; COMMUNICATIONS: FAILURE OF SERVICE 
DURING QUAKE PROMPTED APPROVAL OF $450,000 NETWORK AND BACKUP GENERATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the crucial hours and days after the Jan. 17 earthquake, frantic Simi 
Valley residents dialing City Hall to report damage or seek reassurance got 
nothing but a fast busy signal -- the rude rebuff of a phone system on the 
fritz. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble didn't stop there. Emergency workers trying to coordinate 
emergency efforts by phone were doomed to frustration until a local company 
donated several dozen cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to avoid a repeat of that communications nightmare, the City 
Council on Monday agreed to spend $450,000 in federal quake aid to replace its 
decade-old system with a new phone network and backup generator by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an outdated system that we've needed to update for a long time," 
Councilman Bill Davis said. "The earthquake gave us the kick in the pants to 
actually buckle down and spend the money to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Funded with a federal community development grant, the system will offer many 
new features including: 
</P>
<P>
 * The ability to handle hundreds of calls at once, and replacement of all 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
 * An on-site generator that will keep the phones up and running if the power 
fails. 
</P>
<P>
 * Voice mail for all phones, in addition to the three switchboard operators 
now working at City Hall, the Police Department and the Development Service 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a system that will have a lot more flexibility," Mayor Greg Stratton 
said. "That was really the problem we discovered with the old system: It has no 
ability to perform beyond the everyday requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 In another earthquake-related action, the council agreed to spend $250,000 on 
the first phase of a $5-million project to repair cracked roads and crumbled 
sidewalks on nine major streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been haggling with federal inspectors for months over how much of 
the street damage is quake-related and how much existed before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are fussing over every crack, and that takes time," Stratton said. "In 
the meantime, we should get started on the repairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials are expected to decide by next spring how much of the cost 
of street repairs they will reimburse. The City Council has set aside $1 
million in federal quake relief to cover any costs not included in the federal 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to spend that money to help people rebuild their homes and 
businesses," Stratton said, "But until we hear how much we're getting from the 
feds, we have to hold off." 
</P>
<P>
 Included on the repair list are Alamo, Cochran, Kadota, Stearns and Tapo 
streets, Los Angeles and Yosemite avenues, Kuehner Drive and Madera Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs, which have already begun on Alamo Street, are coming none too soon, 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem starts with these fine little cracks, but then it rains and the 
water seeps in and those cracks become huge holes," Davis said. "If you don't 
seal those cracks early, you end up having to replace the whole road.'

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CASTAIC GETS WAIVER ON SCHOOL BONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 School officials have been given a waiver of a state education code, clearing 
the way for the sale of an additional $6 million in bonds for new school 
construction, state officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in the Castaic Union School District approved a $20-million bond 
measure in 1993, but under a State Department of Education code that is 
supposed to prevent districts from going deep into debt, the top amount allowed 
is $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The code, overlooked by Castaic school officials at the time of the vote, 
states that bonds can be issued only up to 1.25% of the assessed value of 
property within a district's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of that is so school districts don't get so much in debt they 
can't pay it off," said Dwayne Brooks, state assistant superintendent for 
school facilities planning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Castaic officials successfully convinced the State Board of Education that 
the area would safely sell the full $20 million. Castaic homeowners, who pay an 
average of $39.21 per year for the bond measure, will now pay an additional $5. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is selling the bonds to build a junior high school in the Villa 
Canyon area and an elementary school near Camino del Valle Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Forfeiting the $6 million would have jeopardized the new construction, 
according to Michael R. Slater, Castaic district business manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really important," said Slater. "We would have been able to build 
only two-thirds or half of the facilities of the schools." 
</P>
<P>
 School districts in urban areas rarely come close to the bond limit, in place 
since 1976, because their property values are high, according to Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiver was only the latest hurdle the Castaic district has had to overcome 
to raise the construction funds.  
</P>
<P>
 Most bond measures in recent years have come far short of the two-thirds 
approval needed for passage in an election. The Castaic proposal, which was 
approved by 78% of voters, was only the second such measure to pass in the 
Santa Clarita Valley since Proposition 13 was approved in 1978.

DRESS CODE SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ACLU claims that refusing to allow a young man the option to wear a 
T-shirt with a slogan denies him his constitutional right to self-expression. 
Where was the ACLU last year when a young man was murdered on campus? Talk 
about losing the right to express one's self. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley School District has enacted a strict dress code that prohibits 
T-shirts with slogans or pictures of any kind. And rightly so. Educators are 
busy enough with the tasks of teaching without becoming arbiters of the 
political correctness of T-shirt slogans. The Simi policy, though strict, is 
straightforward and simple, leaving virtually no room for misinterpretation or 
confusion. Thus, the schools can get on with their primary mission, to educate 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
 I support the efforts of the Simi Unified School District to create an 
environment in which education and safety take precedence over T-shirt fashions 
and shallow expressions of patriotism.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DRIVE FOR MUSEUM IS CATCHING FIRE; HISTORY: IF 
FUND-RAISING CAMPAIGN SUCCEEDS, FIRETRUCKS, UNIFORMS AND MORE WOULD BE 
DISPLAYED IN OLD STATION 33. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A community group is trying to purchase the city's oldest existing fire 
station to preserve as a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the former Fire Station 33, built in 1939, has been used as 
an art gallery. But Juanita Crothers, who ran the gallery, died last year, and 
her widower has offered to sell it to local history buffs if they can raise the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we tell somebody else about it, they share the excitement," said 
Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Michael Singer, a proponent of the project. "It 
will be a hands-on kind of thing to put people in touch with their past." 
</P>
<P>
 Singer, who also is a member of the Lancaster City Council, said he is not 
seeking city funds for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he helped form a local fund-raising group called SOS 33, for Save Old 
Station 33. If the group can raise about $100,000, it can buy and restore the 
station as a museum. It would be operated by the nonprofit County of Los 
Angeles Fire Museum Assn., made up of volunteers seeking to preserve historic 
firefighting equipment and memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 SOS 33 already has scheduled its first major fund-raiser, a barbecue and craft 
fair that will take place Oct. 30 at the station on Cedar Avenue just south of 
Lancaster Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster resident Mindy Dell is spearheading the fund drive, even though 
neither she nor any member of her family is affiliated with a fire department. 
Dell said she supports the work done by firefighters and is eager to preserve 
one of the oldest buildings remaining in downtown Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in letting our heritage slip away," she said. "Once it's 
bulldozed, you can't get it back." 
</P>
<P>
 It is already too late to save the community's first fire station, also called 
Station 33 and built in 1927, Dell said. It was demolished years ago and is now 
a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes to preserve its successor, which originally housed one firetruck and 
one or two permanent firefighters. When an emergency occurred, these 
firefighters were assisted by "callmen," or part-timers who were paid for each 
alarm they responded to. 
</P>
<P>
 According to old Fire Department records, the land for the 1939 station was 
purchased for about $432, and the building cost almost $6,600 to construct. In 
1966, county firefighters moved to a larger, more modern station a few doors 
south on Cedar. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Gorrindo, a fire engineer assigned to the newest Station 33, said he 
supports the idea of turning the older firehouse into a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good deal for the kids," he said. "We give tours all the time. This 
would let the them see a new station, then an older one at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Old fire stations that pass into private hands often lose their historic value 
when they are gutted and rebuilt as a restaurant or another type of business. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bob Hancock, president of the Fire Museum Assn., said the operators of the 
art galley did not significantly alter the old Station 33. "It's pretty much in 
the original shape," said Hancock, a fire captain at the county's Lake Los 
Angeles station. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fund raising succeeds, there will be no trouble finding old firetrucks, 
uniforms, alarm boxes and other items to put on display. Hancock said his 
association has far more property than it has room to exhibit in a small 
showcase area at the department's headquarters in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had people offer to donate fire engines to the association," he said. 
"I've had to turn them down because we don't have enough storage space."

THAT SIDELINE INCIDENT WAS 'JUST TALK'; PRO FOOTBALL: RAIDER COACH ART SHELL 
TRIES TO DOWNPLAY HIS ARGUMENT WITH JEFF HOSTETLER AS MERELY PART OF THE GAME. 
QUARTERBACK SAYS HE HAS 'NO REGRETS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after shouting at quarterback Jeff Hostetler on the sideline, Los 
Angeles Raider Coach Art Shell downplayed the incident, calling it "just talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler said the argument stemmed from his changing plays sent in by the 
coach. He said it was his responsibility as quarterback to do what he did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't regret at all the way I handled it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell and Hostetler were captured by television cameras as they argued late in 
the second quarter of the Raiders' 20-17 overtime loss to the Miami Dolphins at 
Joe Robbie Stadium Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What sideline incident?" Shell asked straight-faced when the subject was 
broached Monday. "It was just a coach and a player having a discussion, just 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened yesterday is over. Yesterday's game is gone, it's on to the 
next one. We're trying to win, we don't have time to think about what's past. 
I'm moving forward, I'm sure he is, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to discuss that anymore. It's a dead issue. It's nothing big, 
it's just a coach and a player having a discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler, speaking after a team meeting, said he was surprised by Shell's 
reaction on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I changed a couple of plays," he said. "Art didn't like it. He's the head 
coach and it's his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something as a quarterback, you have a feel for the game, you're in 
the huddle with the rest of the guys, sometimes you want to change something 
because guys are more comfortable with it. I'm the quarterback, I take 
responsibility for what I did. The rest was Art's decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders (2-4) led, 10-7, when Hostetler, who had been taking a pounding 
from the Dolphins, exchanged words with Shell after throwing three straight 
incompletions. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell reacted by replacing Hostetler with Vince Evans for two series. But 
Hostetler started the second half and played the rest of the game, which turned 
out to be one of his poorest as a Raider. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler finished 8-for-23 for 95 yards, but was under constant pressure and 
had several on-target passes dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "The passing game has to pick up, that's the key for us," Shell said. "It just 
really hasn't gotten untracked. It's not the kind of machine it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It starts with pass protection, there's no doubt about that. We had some 
breakdowns in pass protection yesterday and that hurt us. And we dropped some 
balls, we had six or seven drops. That's too many." 
</P>
<P>
 Like his coach, Evans minimized the sideline argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's not going to be a problem," Evans said. "They're both great 
competitors, Hoss and Coach Shell. It won't be a big deal, I'm sure it will all 
be cleared up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I show frustration on the sideline, as I'm sure a lot of guys do. When you 
don't come out with victories, it's frustrating. But we're going to pull it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders linebacker Winston Moss admitted that such incidents aren't often seen 
during games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is to not make it any more than it is," Moss said. 
"We make a couple plays, we win the ballgame, we're not talking about this now. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these guys are men. Art and Jeff saw things differently. Of course, it's 
emotional. Tempers get hot, those things happen everywhere. Things are going to 
get hot, that's just part of football." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins tied the game, 17-17, early in the fourth quarter by moving 43 
yards in six plays after recovering a fumbled punt by Tim Brown. Television 
replays indicated Brown lost the ball after hitting the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a fumble," Shell said. "It was a terrible call, terrible. You 
could see Tim Brown, see he was going to get nailed and he goes down. And now 
they get the ball . . . it's a short field. That's very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell also pointed out that his team had five holding calls in the first half 
and the Dolphins had none. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are infractions on the other side that aren't called," he said. "I just 
want the playing field level, that's all. When there's no balance, I have a 
problem."

COMMENTARY; ORIOLES WERE WISE NOT TO RECYCLE THIS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In hiring Phil Regan to manage, the Baltimore Orioles took a different 
direction, because for the first time in more than a quarter century they will 
be directed by a man who wasn't schooled in their farm system as a player or 
manager. This is good. It offers a different dimension to the same old way of 
doing things. Instead, there's going to be a fresh approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the Orioles didn't let we sportswriters make the decision of Dave 
Johnson, who was the pre-selection favorite and the people's choice. Recycling 
the "old boys school" also takes a beating. 
</P>
<P>
 General manager Roland Hemond, in his introductory remarks Sunday, made the 
statement that Regan has "seen more players the last 10 years than anyone in 
baseball." He could make the comment with little fear of contradiction because 
Regan has been in the game on an around-the-calendar basis, managing in Latin 
American winter leagues and scouting for the Seattle Mariners and Los Angeles 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Regan, with soft features and well-spoken manner, said the man who made the 
most important impact on his handling of players and situations was the late 
Walter Alston, Hall of Fame manager for the Dodgers. Alston wasn't into 
histrionics; sincerity and resolve were his attributes. 
</P>
<P>
 If Regan fulfills a personal desire to be anything like Alston, the Orioles 
have themselves a winner after conducting a rather unusual search for a manager 
-- much like a bank or corporation being on the hunt for the replacement of a 
top executive. It led to Regan, a manager of promise who made extraordinary 
improvement last season while pitching coach of the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Some unusual developments emerge in the hiring of Regan. The Orioles, in the 
language of the wild West, literally cut off the Texas Rangers at the pass. 
Doug Melvin, general manager of the Rangers for only a week after being with 
the Orioles for nine years, wanted to interview Regan for the vacant managing 
job, but never got the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles beat Melvin to the punch by wrapping up Regan before he could get 
out of Baltimore. It therefore could be deducted that Melvin, even though deep 
in the heart of Texas, influenced the appointment by first bringing up Regan's 
name to the Orioles and then, after becoming a general manager, putting him 
high on his own managerial list. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the new manager still has an airline ticket in his pocket to 
Dallas-Fort Worth for a meeting about the position, but that's not going to 
happen. The trip won't be necessary. From a historical standpoint, Regan 
becomes the first former pitcher (excluding Luman Harris, who finished out the 
1961 season when Paul Richards defected to Houston) to manage the major- league 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 Significant, too, is he qualifies as the first manager to lead the club 
without an Orioles background in 26 years. Such predecessors as Johnny Oates, 
Frank Robinson, Cal Ripken Sr., Joe Altobelli and Earl Weaver were programmed 
in the Oriole way of doing things, either playing for the club or managing in 
the farm system. This is a departure. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dave Johnson, who wanted the appointment, it's a disappointment. Johnson, 
besides being a first-rate leader and strategist, said all the right things, 
which began to sound as if they could be political overkill. As an applicant, 
Johnson mentioned he looked forward to the possibility of being around such an 
intelligent owner as Peter Angelos and that Tom Clancy, another Orioles 
investor, was an author whose books he thrilled to read. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson no doubt believes extending such compliments didn't score any points 
for his candidacy in the final countdown. Angelos wasn't present for Regan's 
unveiling, which is worthy of applause. An ideal decision. He let the four-man 
committee of Roland Hemond, Frank Robinson, Joe Foss and Russ Smouse do the 
early work, make the judgment and take the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 It was admirable of Angelos to let it happen that way. "I think it was his 
method of showing respect to all of us," explained Hemond. "It was Peter 
telling us if we fellows were thinking that way and liked Phil as much as we 
said then by all means hire him." 
</P>
<P>
 So Angelos, after meeting Regan, told the committee to make the announcement. 
He preferred to remain absent. No cheap bows by upstaging Hemond, Robinson, 
Foss and Smouse by playing the "big shot" role at the press gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of Regan happened when the man perceived as the leading 
candidate, Johnson, was away on a trip. He was out-to-sea fishing, but is due 
back soon. Hemond tried to call Dave at his Florida residence but could only 
leave a message. This after informing the Cincinnati Reds that Regan, not 
Johnson, was the Orioles' preference. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some impressive parts to Regan's background. He pitched in the 
majors for 13 years after being signed originally by Jack Tighe for the Detroit 
Tigers. Once his career was over, he coached Grand Valley State College in 
Grand Rapids, Mich., which gave him a different look at how the game is played. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the last decade he has managed during the winter in Venezuela and the 
Dominican Republic, winning three Caribbean Series championships. The owner of 
the Caracas team, one Oscar Prieto, said he could have the job for as long as 
he wanted -- which is a rich testimonial to his ability. "I'll be going back to 
Venezuela soon because I feel an obligation," he said -- which tells something 
about his character. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Regan rejected the Miami Marlins. "I wanted to go with a club 
that could win," he explained. In his Baltimore remarks he offered a promise 
that few incoming managers would make when he added, "There's no doubt in my 
mind we are going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 As for getting along with the front office, he brings up Alston again when he 
says Walter told him "a manager has to stay in touch with the front office -- a 
matter of communication." There's a seasoned attitude about Phil Regan, a quiet 
confidence that can only come with experience. He's more than ready to deal 
with the new adventure.

 Angel reliever Ken Patterson and catcher Andy Allanson, each of whom has his 
season derailed by bizarre circumstances, cleared waivers and elected to become 
free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels filled the two roster spots with pitcher Mike James and utility 
player Luis Raven.They also took pitcher Kyle Sebach off the roster and sent 
him outright to triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, whom the Angels reacquired on their final day of spring training, 
was recalled to the big leagues April 24. He threw six pitches against the 
Boston Red Sox before tearing a ligament in his elbow, requiring season-ending 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Allanson's contract was bought June 28 by the Angels, who then discovered that 
he had a broken right finger that necessitated surgery. He never played a game 
for the big league team.

 Laker assistant coach Michael Cooper has pleaded guilty to battery against his 
wife and received a deferred sentence while he continues counseling, a clerk in 
Corrales, N.M., Municipal Court said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, who attended the University of New Mexico and has a home in suburban 
Albuquerque, was arrested July 27 and charged with assault and battery, both 
misdemeanors.Under an agreement, he pleaded to the battery charge and the 
assault charge was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Court clerk Margaret Lumpmouth said the plea agreement with the Corrales 
prosecutor calls for Cooper to go six months without any violent incidents and 
requires continued attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in Albuquerque 
and Los Angeles. If he complies, his record will be cleared.

INVENTORIES UP 1% IN AUGUST DESPITE FASTEST SALES IN 7 1/2 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Businesses built up their stockpiles at a rapid pace in August despite the 
fastest sales in 7 1/2 years, the Commerce Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Inventories rose 1%, the fifth consecutive advance and the biggest since 1.2% 
in May, the department said. Sales rose 3% as auto dealers restocked after 
shutting down in July to retool for 1995 models. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the figures are fresh evidence of economic strength, increasing 
the chances that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates again next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the inventory increase will probably inflate the economic 
expansion in the third quarter to about 3%, making another boost in short-term 
interest rates by the Fed more likely when central bank policy-makers meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little bit surprised the accumulation is so high," said economist Sung 
Won Sohn of Norwest Corp., a Minneapolis bank. "But much of it was due to 
automobiles. Earlier this summer, Detroit was short of cars because of 
retooling and the demand for hot-selling cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Sung said there may have been some involuntary buildup by retailers, 
particularly at clothing and department stores, where apparel sales have been 
lagging. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, analysts said the inventory increase will probably inflate the economic 
expansion in the third quarter to about 3%, making another boost in short-term 
interest rates by the Fed more likely when central bank policy-makers meet next 
month. The Fed has raised rates five times this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's first estimate of gross domestic product for the third 
quarter is due Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The inventory accumulation "is stronger than expected," said economist Marilyn 
Schaja of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York. "The 
economy continues to push along." 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts had predicted inventories would increase 0.4% in August, less 
than half the actual bulge. 
</P>
<P>
 The report had little impact on financial markets.

GOVERNMENT TAKES AIM AT GM PICKUPS; AUTOS: THE 1973-87 C-K TRUCKS ARE FOUND TO 
POSE AN 'UNREASONABLE RISK.' COMPANY VOWS A FIGHT IN COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. C-K series pickup trucks, which have been involved in 
several fatal fires following side-impact crashes, pose an "unreasonable risk," 
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 He scheduled a Dec. 6 hearing to determine whether the government should 
require GM to recall the trucks, made between 1973 and 1987, which are sold 
under the GMC and Chevrolet nameplates. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision "is totally unjustified," Bruce G. MacDonald, GM vice president 
for communications, said in Detroit. "The suggestion that GM put sales ahead of 
safety is outrageous and wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The company rejected an April 9, 1993, government request that it recall the 
trucks voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 people have died as a result of side-impact fires in the trucks in 
crashes that were otherwise survivable, and many others suffered serious burns, 
Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucks have been widely criticized because their fuel tanks are mounted 
outside the body frame, allowing for larger tanks and therefore longer driving 
range, but making the tanks vulnerable to damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This design was selected for marketing reasons," Pena said, adding that it 
was not changed for 15 years despite "evidence that GM was aware, possibly as 
early as the mid-1970s but certainly by the early 1980s, that this design made 
these trucks more vulnerable and that fatalities from side-impact fires were 
occurring." 
</P>
<P>
 A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study found 2.8 fire-related 
deaths per 1 million registered vehicle years in the GM pickups, compared to 
one death per million in Ford trucks, which enclose the fuel tank within the 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9 million of the GM trucks were built and about half are believed to 
still be on the road, the Transportation Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The record clearly shows that there is an increased risk associated with 
these GM pickups, and (it) leads me to conclude at this point that the risk is 
unreasonable," Pena told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's MacDonald said the trucks "have fully met the applicable safety standards 
for fuel system integrity in collisions. . . . There is simply no legal or 
scientific basis on which to seek a recall of these trucks under the Vehicle 
Safety Act. If necessary, we will defend their safety in court." 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Pena noted that the law requires vehicles to both meet 
safety standards and to be safe in "real world conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The government began investigating the safety of the pickups in 1992 in 
response to petitions by the Center for Auto Safety and Public Citizen. It has 
collected more than 100,000 pages of material on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing is required before a company can be ordered to conduct a 
recall.  
</P>
<P>
 However, even if the government acted immediately, the eight-year statute of 
limitations would bar it from requiring a recall of trucks made before 1986, 
limiting the action to the last two model years involved. GM changed the design 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, a Georgia court overturned a ruling that GM was liable for the 1989 
death of a teen-ager in one of the trucks, voiding a $105.2-million award to 
the victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's rebuttal to a "Dateline NBC" program that portrayed the trucks as 
dangerous disclosed that toy rocket engines had been used to fake an explosion 
in a collision staged for the broadcast.

HEALTHWATCH: BODY WATCH; A SUBJECT SOME WOMEN PREFER TO IGNORE

 Women are closemouthed when it comes to discussing incontinence. They'll 
suffer an average of seven years before seeking medical help. In women -- who 
make up a hefty 85% of the 15 million incontinent Americans -- bladder control 
diminishes because of pelvic floor muscles weakened by childbirth and 
post-menopausal loss of estrogen. They also have a wider pelvis than men. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatments include surgery, Kegel exercises to strengthen pelvic floor 
muscles, a pessary, medications and behavior-modification techniques, 
self-catheterizing and fat injections to tighten muscles around the urethra. 
Products are under development that will plug up the urethra a few hours at a 
time. One device adheres to and seals the urethra. A Bitter Pill to Swallow 
</P>
<P>
 We called a pharmaceutical research company to talk about people who can't 
swallow pills. The woman we spoke to said just talking about the problem made 
her throat constrict. "I hate big chalky horse pills. So do my kids," she said. 
"You have to force yourself (to take pills) . . . at gunpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone we spoke with, from pharmacist to professor, either hated taking 
pills or knew someone who did. Daniel C. Robinson, associate professor and 
chairman of clinical pharmacy at USC, said, "I seem to get things stuck so I 
take large gulps of water . . . plenty of fluid to suspend and carry the 
tablet." Drinking lots of water proved to be the popular solution. Also, coated 
caplets were preferable to gel caps, which stick as soon as they're moistened. 
</P>
<P>
 You can try to overcome the aversion. Dennis J. Munjack, associate professor 
of psychiatry at USC, offered this: "When you eat, you pulverize your food into 
mush. Pills don't dissolve, so there's a sense of a hard object in the mouth 
and it won't go down the throat. Nick the pill with your fingernail. Use the 
smallest amount -- even a granule. Take the small amount of the pill and 
swallow a lot of water so it can go down. Work up to the full amount of the 
pill until you don't feel that sensation in the back of the throat. Drink large 
amounts of water. Once you get the sense that the pill goes down OK, then you 
can start taking larger amounts." Briefly . . .

 Call (800) LUNG-USA for radon information and a $7 test kit (usually $15-$20)

appointment, 9 a.m.-noon at Santa Monica Hospital's Les Kelley Auditorium, 1255 
15th St., Santa Monica . . . Veterans in the Greater Los Angeles area can call 
(310) 824-6935 or (310) 824-6811 for free transportation to and from U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs' West Los Angeles Medical Center for treatment . 
. . Michael Rouse of the Southern California College of Optometry suggests 
spraying eye medication on children's eyelids and lashes. It's as effective as 
traditional eye drops, minus the usual anxiety . . . In 1763, the Rev. Edward 
Stone, in a search to treat fever, found that willow tree bark yielded 
salicylic acid, a derivative of what is now known as acetylsalicylic acid, or 
aspirin.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A STORY OF LITERARY DREAMS AND REVENGE; THE DEVIL'S OWN 
WORK BY ALAN JUDD ; KNOPF $17, 115 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Spare, elegant and haunting, "The Devil's Own Work" is a rarity in an era of 
overstuffed blockbusters. Told in the rueful voice of an aging academic, the 
novel begins just after the narrator and a university acquaintance have settled 
in London to begin what they hope will be literary careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward is the golden boy, exuding an aura of confidence and charm, an effect 
heightened by his blond hair and the azure eyes that "spoke of seas and skies, 
of friendship, of layers and depths, while all the time giving the appearance 
of being fascinated by whoever engaged him, a gaze that seemed to project his 
whole being upon you, while mine showed only a baffled striving." 
</P>
<P>
 Established early, the essential difference between the two men is maintained 
throughout the book. Bolstered by family funds, Edward is able to manage by 
writing occasional book reviews while working on his first novel. The narrator, 
less fortunate, is an English teacher, and we know from his ironic, 
self-deprecating tone that he's likely to remain one, resigned if not entirely 
content. He marries a French girl, leads a scholarly life on the fringes of the 
media world, and keeps in touch with Edward, whose star begins to rise almost 
at once. 
</P>
<P>
 When Edward publishes a scathing review of the latest novel by the venerated, 
elderly English writer O.M. Tyrell, he becomes an instant celebrity. Tyrell has 
been an institution for decades, virtually reviewer-proof, and when he's 
excoriated by a young upstart, the literary Establishment is astounded. 
Thoughtful and closely reasoned as well as clever, the review takes Tyrell to 
task for emphasizing style over content, castigating him for disguising hollow 
themes with flashy prose. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of ignoring him, Tyrell invites Edward to his home in the south of 
France, an amazing gesture from a man known to be reclusive and unconcerned 
with the London literary scene. The date set for the meeting with Tyrell 
coincides with a trip that the narrator and his fiancee, Chantal, make to visit 
her parents in Antibes, and the three plan to meet on the Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite by chance, the narrator encounters Tyrell before Edward arrives -- 
recognizing him in a cafe, accompanied by his much younger wife. Edward goes to 
Tyrell's house as planned and spends an apparently pleasant social evening with 
the couple. The next day, Tyrell's death is announced to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 When Edward fails to meet his friends for dinner that night to report on his 
evening with Tyrell, they drive to Tyrell's house, anxious and feeling as if 
they had been summoned. He stares at the windows, catching a glimpse of 
Tyrell's wife. But he dismisses his impression of a man standing behind her as 
a trick of the moonlight or of his own overheated imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, they catch up with Edward at a cafe, and learn that shortly 
after a pleasant dinner and a few hours of conversation, Tyrell suffered a 
fatal heart attack. To his friends' surprise, Edward says he has no intention 
of publishing his interview with the writer. He adds that Tyrell had given him 
a manuscript; virtually forced it upon him, saying that he must take it, that 
it was meant for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The three return to England, the teacher to his quiet life, Edward to fame and 
fortune. Novels pour from his pen in torrents, and he becomes even more 
celebrated than Tyrell in his heyday. Although the narrator has only glanced at 
the manuscript given to Edward, he is convinced that the book is clearly not 
the work of Tyrell. The volume seems ancient, and the fine, thin pen strokes 
covering the pages could almost be hieroglyphics for all the sense they make to 
him. He assumes that Edward has been given an antique souvenir culled from 
Tyrell's library. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time the two men meet, Edward casually tells his friend that he's 
been living with Tyrell's widow, Eudoxie, whom he seems to have inherited along 
with the old man's fame. Years pass, and the paths of the schoolmaster and the 
famous writer diverge. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, after his rancorous divorce, the narrator is in a small Yorkshire 
town being interviewed for a new post. To his astonishment, he sees Edward, 
unkempt and alcoholic, walking aimlessly around the town's chief attraction, a 
ruined castle. Edward, he remembers, had originally come from Yorkshire, so the 
coincidence was perhaps not so bizarre, certainly not a patch on the story 
Edward eventually tells. 
</P>
<P>
 Wry and insightful, "The Devil's Own Work" toys with the notion of demonic 
possession but becomes a thoroughly realistic and highly original story of 
revenge; a chilling cautionary tale for literary critics and an unalloyed 
delight for everyone else.

COMMUNITY COLLEGES MAY OFFER EARLY RETIREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Community College District is nearing agreement with union 
officials on an early-retirement package that could spur one of the district's 
largest faculty shake-ups in years, with estimates that up to 20% of its 
full-time instructors might retire. 
</P>
<P>
 If enough of the district's older full-time teachers opt for the incentive, 
officials said the result would be an opportunity to reinvigorate academic 
programs and diversify its faculty through the mass replacement hiring that 
would occur. At present, about 70% of the full-time faculty is white, even 
though the district's college-age population is about 70% minority. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also expects to save money through the deal. The theory is that 
the cost of providing the bonus to retiring faculty members would be more than 
offset by the salary savings from bringing in new instructors at lower pay 
scales because of their lesser experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity for us to do a restructuring and yet also give employees 
who have spent a long time in this district a better opportunity to retire," 
said Chancellor Neil Yoneji, who oversees the district's nine campuses and 
nearly 104,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal being discussed, the incentive would be offered to about 
700 of the district's more than 1,500 full-time instructors -- all those age 55 
and older. Faculty union President Leon Marzillier estimated that 200 to 300 of 
those teachers might accept the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has an unusually large share of older faculty because of the boom 
in local hiring that occurred in the 1960s and early 1970s. Two-thirds of the 
district's full-time faculty are age 50 or older, and more than one-quarter are 
age 60 or older, according to statistics provided by Marzillier. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those considering the deal is Richard Wright. At age 82, Wright is the 
district's oldest full-time instructor, according to the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my friends are retired, and I'm thinking about joining them," said 
Wright, who's taught business administration for 31 years at Valley College in 
Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a momentous decision to be made," added Sid Elman, a 33-year political 
science instructor at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, who said he's still 
mulling the proposal. "When people used to ask why I didn't retire, I'd say 
teaching is therapy. It keeps me going," Elman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, district officials had been aiming to offer the retirement package 
immediately, with the retirements to take effect at the end of the fall 
semester. But now, officials said the time frame has been delayed so that any 
retirements would take effect at the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, faculty members would get an extra 7% of their final basic 
salary in an annual lifetime annuity in addition to their regular pension 
benefit. An earlier proposal was 4%. But for the program to proceed, at least 
125 faculty members must participate. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, a top-scale faculty member in the district without a doctorate 
earns a salary of about $50,550, union officials said. Normally, such a person 
retiring with 30 years experience would get a 60% pension, or about $30,330 a 
year. The incentive would add more than $3,500 a year to that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials and the district's faculty union, the American Federation 
of Teachers College Guild, have been negotiating the package in recent weeks. 
Some officials said they expect a deal to be brought to the district's Board of 
Trustees in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoneji agreed a deal appears likely, but was reluctant to say when it might be 
presented to the board. If enacted, the proposal then would be formally offered 
to eligible faculty members. And if enough agreed to participate, then the 
package would proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials, who have been struggling with declining enrollments and 
battered finances in recent years, also reportedly are considering offering a 
similar package to senior administrators and staff members. But it likely would 
come after the faculty package. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has offered several retirement incentives over the past decade, 
most recently a small one several years ago and a larger one about five years 
ago, officials said. The latest offer could produce the largest number of 
retirements if it attracts as many participants as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the latest proposal, the district is promising to replace at least 
three-quarters of the retiring full-time instructors with new full-time 
teachers within an 18-month period. The open slots could be left vacant or 
filled with part-time instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 The new hiring also would provide an opportunity to restructure outdated 
academic programs and shift faculty resources to meet current areas of student 
demand such as English as a second language classes. Absent retirements, that 
is difficult because tenured faculty cannot easily be shifted to other 
disciplines.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; IMMIGRATION IS THE THEME FOR SCHOOL MUSICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Proposition 187, the controversial ballot initiative that seeks to curb 
illegal immigration, made headlines Monday, students at Canoga Park Elementary 
School put finishing touches on a musical play about how many of their parents 
fulfilled their dreams by coming to America. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 youngsters at the school, where the student population is about 
80% Latino, rehearsed the play, "Give Me Your Tired, Give Me Your Poor," for 
the last time Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The play dramatizes the stories of some of the children's parents and their 
moves to the United States from their home countries, said fifth-grade teacher 
Andrew Casey, who coordinated the production. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an original play, written by the kids," Casey said, who combined the 
text the children wrote with songs ranging from "My Girl" by Smokey Robinson, 
which is sung to Lady Liberty, to Tracy Chapman's "Talking 'Bout a Revolution," 
lip-synced by a boy playing a Haitian man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's kind of fun understanding all the cultures," said Johnny Arias, 
10, who sings in the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has ancestors from another country," said Johnny, whose parents are 
from El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn Pierfax, 10, said from working on the play, he learned that "People come 
here to have a better life." 
</P>
<P>
 He also discovered, he said, that people "can be friends if they treat people 
nice and don't do rude things." 
</P>
<P>
 At the close of the play, the children sing "Coming to America," a song 
written by Casey, with lyrics that go: "Oh, give me your tired, give me your 
poor. Fulfill your dream, may your journey endure. Yes, come to America. Come 
to America." 
</P>
<P>
 Four performances will be given Wednesday at 8:45, 9:45 and 11:30 a.m. and at 
6:15 p.m. MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; COUNCIL MEETINGS MAY AIR ON CABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Current and past members of the Glendale City Council have long had an 
aversion to broadcasting their business on the small screen, but come February 
that could all change. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to approve an $85,000 contract today to install 
television cameras in the council chambers and hire a private firm to direct 
the weekly telecasts of its meetings over Sammons Communications cable system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good investment in democracy," said Mayor Eileen Givens, who 
included broadcasting council meetings on cable in her campaign platform when 
she ran for election in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, residents and community activists have occasionally called 
for the council to begin televising its meetings just as Burbank, Los Angeles 
and other cities do. In 1992, the city manager's office even conducted a survey 
showing that more than half the cities similar in size to Glendale in the Los 
Angeles area televise their council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most council members fiercely opposed the idea because they believed the cost 
was prohibitive. But attitudes have shifted since the April, 1993, elections, 
when three incumbents -- all of whom were against televising the meetings -- 
retired from office and were replaced by new members. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, council members approved a study of the costs, set aside 
$100,000 in the budget for the project and then solicited proposals from 
contractors interested in airing the broadcasts.  
</P>
<P>
 The council will vote today on awarding the job to Burbank-based Studio 
Spectrum, which has proposed installing a robotically controlled four-camera 
system in the council chambers. The company will also provide two portable 
camera systems for remote filming of city-related programs and will upgrade the 
audio components in council chambers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially I think this is the right thing to do, and as it turns out it is 
also affordable," Givens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the system has been installed, the weekly council meetings will be 
broadcast live at 2 p.m. Tuesdays and rebroadcast later in the week during the 
evenings, officials said. STEVE RYFLE

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; BRAIN INJURED: MANY 
NEEDS, FEW RESOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The painful truth for Anne McLean is that modern medicine's ability to save 
lives has advanced beyond the generosity of society to provide for victims of 
serious brain injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't keep going," said McLean, who started Project Headway with a group 
of other parents of brain-injured adults 10 years ago. "We need donations 
desperately." 
</P>
<P>
 Project Headway runs three group homes in Northridge and one in Reseda, caring 
for adults who have suffered brain injuries through car accidents, gunshot 
wounds, strokes, aneurysms and boating accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish-born McLean, who formerly lived in Australia, came to Los Angeles 
after her son Martin was hit by a drunk driver in 1980. "My son was a 
businessman," McLean said. "He came up the 405 one day and he never came back." 
</P>
<P>
 She found that although doctors were able to save her son's life, there was no 
financial help from either government agencies or social services to care for 
him. Her son had $1 million in health-insurance coverage before the accident, 
and it was spent within a year and a half, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he knows us," McLean said. "There are times when he will be 
loving, and sometimes he will be very frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 There still is no help for families, aside from Project Headway, and they 
don't have any more room, McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing a good job," said Shirley Weisberg, who met McLean in a parents' 
support group at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. Her son was injured in a 
boating accident. "But we've paid a hell of a price." 
</P>
<P>
 The costs are financial as much as emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money's so tight, there is always a possibility of foreclosure," Weisberg 
said. "Making the mortgage every month is one of our most difficult tasks." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's 16-year-old van needs brakes, so the group is transporting 
patients in a 30-seat bus that was donated for trips. The washing machine, 
needed for countless loads of adult diapers, has broken down. And the agency 
can't afford to replace the needed part for the machine, so a repairman is 
trying to rebuild it for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of laws on the books that work against us, instead of for us," 
Weisberg said. For example, the agency's license is only as an adult group home 
instead of as a 24-hour constant care facility. Unlike homes for adults born 
with mental impairment, there is no category for assistance to those who 
suffered serious brain injuries after they reach age 18. 
</P>
<P>
 For the same reason, Social Security checks for residents cover only room and 
board, but give no help for the continual care that Project Headway must 
provide. Residents are often helpless and cannot feed and bathe themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooms at Project Headway group homes are decorated with pictures, toys and 
personal effects. "We try to give them a home as close to what they had," 
Weisberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so impressed with what they have done for them," said Sybil Rosenman of 
Las Vegas, whose 39-year-old daughter, Marla, lives in one of the homes. Her 
daughter was on her way to a master's degree in psychology when a rare brain 
disease struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter as a young girl was a phenomenal artist," Rosenman said, holding 
up a detailed sculpture of a shoe in one hand, made when Marla was young. In 
the other hand, Rosenman holds up a crude picture of a cat, made recently. 
"They had such promise," Rosenman said of the residents of Project Headway. 
"And by a twist of fate, it's taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 A cruel question for McLean is whether she is grateful that modern technology 
saved her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my son very dearly," McLean said, her eyes turning teary. "I think God 
would have been good to him and us if he had taken him."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; NEW AGENCY MIGHT TARGET RED TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new Glendale city agency focused on cutting red tape for developers and 
business owners could be created today, despite complaints that it would 
actually result in more, not less, bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed Development Services Department stems from an organizational 
audit of the city, performed by an outside consultant this year. It produced 28 
recommendations to make the city run more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 The new department would oversee business licenses, building inspections and 
zoning and design reviews -- tasks that are currently spread among six 
departments, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the City Council postponed its vote on the matter until today after 
critics charged that the changes were being made without public input. An 
informational meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m. today before the council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may have studied this for 18 months, (but) no one else has," former 
Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg told the council. She said it is important that 
the council maintain "a sense of openness." 
</P>
<P>
 Bremberg also said the restructuring would put tremendous power in the hands 
of the director of the new agency. Removing functions such as zoning and design 
reviews from the Planning Department, as proposed, would be folly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any city where that's been done," Bremberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 But proponents of the move contend it would help the local economy by 
eliminating bureaucratic redundancies. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager David Ramsay, who led a committee of city department heads that 
drew up the plans for the department, said the agency would be created without 
adding personnel and would simplify the bureaucratic maze for those trying to 
get a business permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to say you want to be a more business-minded city and another 
thing to actually take steps to become that way," Ramsay said. "The mission of 
this new department is that for anyone who wants to develop their property or 
open a business in the city, given the rules, we want to make it a successful 
experience for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The new department would replace the Glendale Redevelopment Agency and take on 
functions related to land use, business services and economic development, 
business retention and business-related promotional events, such as street 
fairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's informational meeting was slated after Mayor Eileen Givens and other 
council members said they had not studied the impacts of creating the new 
department enough to vote on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Larry Zarian said he is eager to begin implementing some of the 
recommendations of the Warner Group, the firm that audited the city's 
organizational structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often bureaucracy is created by dividing too many duties among too many 
departments," Zarian said. "If we want this city to run more efficiently and 
more like a business, we should begin implementing some of the things that make 
a business successful." STEVE RYFLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; BEETLES, SQUIRRELS PESTERING OAK TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chatsworth's oak trees, under severe stress from the years of drought and 
increasing air pollution, must wait until spring for relief from a plague of 
bark-boring "twig girdler" beetles that are slowly killing the trees, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power got involved in 
efforts to save Chatsworth's oak trees, many of them hundreds of years old, 
after residents noticed that many of the trees appeared to be dying. About 60 
California live oaks and California valley oaks can be found in the Chatsworth 
Reservoir, which is owned by DWP. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak trees are viewed as a precious ecological resource and are protected under 
city and county ordinances.  
</P>
<P>
 DWP officials held a town meeting last month with residents to discuss the 
possibility of spraying a pesticide that would eliminate the beetles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some residents had concerns about the spraying," said Mindy Berman, a DWP 
spokesman. "So we've decided to hold off for now. The bug is going into its 
dormant phase, so spraying now would be ineffective. We'll have to wait until 
the spring. In May, we'll have to take a comprehensive look at the situation 
and decide what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents also asked the department to consult with independent arborists 
before taking action.  
</P>
<P>
 Berman said the department's horticultural experts are hoping for a wet 
winter, which would increase the trees' strength and ability to resist the 
bark-eating bugs that lay their eggs in the bark. When the eggs hatch, the 
beetles eat their way out of the tree.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the DWP will continue filling ground squirrels' burrows 
around the "dead zone," an area six feet in diameter beneath the trees. The 
squirrels are also partly responsible for the sad condition of the oaks, which 
had clusters of dead, brown leaves and branches well before autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do what we can; we're definitely concerned," Berman said. 
"Those oaks are older than all of us put together." TIM MAY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; HOMEOWNERS GROUP PRESIDENT TO RESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Gross, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization for five 
often stormy years, said Monday he will resign after his current term expires 
at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been involved in the organization for eight years, and I've been 
president for the past five, so I guess it's time to bring in some fresh 
blood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll still be on the board, probably as one of its two vice presidents. The 
nominating committee is working on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, who has a background in purchasing and procurement management, said he 
also wants to devote more time to finding work. He lost his job about a year 
ago, he said, when the company he worked for, Kahr Bearing, moved to Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 During his five years as president of the organization, Gross led several 
fights against development, including the controversial Warner Ridge project, a 
large-scale office site near Pierce College. The project ultimately fell 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization also has been active in an effort 
to prevent former officials of Pierce College from making cuts in the school's 
agriculture program.  
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Murley, chairman of the nominating committee, said that as far as he 
knows, no one has expressed an interest in replacing Gross. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are thinking about being president are not quite sure if they want 
to put up with the type of crap we get from newspapers, the Chamber of 
Commerce, the developers and all the other people who might not agree with us 
at times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murley said that, to date, there are about five slots to be filled on the 
organization's board.  
</P>
<P>
 The organization's next activity will be a forum Oct. 27 for candidates in the 
24th Congressional and the 41st state Assembly districts. Rep. Anthony 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) and his opponent Rich Sybert, a Republican, are 
scheduled to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates for the 41st Assembly District are Sheila Kuehl, a Democrat, 
and Michael Meehan, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum will be held at 7:30 p.m. at Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center in 
Woodland Hills. FRANK MANNING

 Last December, Melissa Toy's life was torn apart by the deaths of three close 
friends, one a 13-year-old girl, in a murder-suicide, the result of a domestic 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 As a way of dealing with her pain and fed up with the violence that seems to 
prevail in today's society, Toy decided that the only way similar incidents 
could be prevented was to address the problem at it roots -- with children. 
</P>
<P>
 So, she created "The Wee Whirligigs," an all-volunteer puppet troupe, which, 
with the help of a few of Toy's friends and family, will make its debut 
performance Saturday in an El Monte facility for delinquent children during the 
fourth annual "National Make A Difference Day." 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to the conclusion that violence is a learned trait in our society," 
Toy said. "However, if violence can be learned, then so too can peace. A puppet 
show is a fun way to teach children how to deal with their problems in a 
nonviolent way." 
</P>
<P>
 The show is aimed at children, ages 5 to 8, and is available to orphanages, 
schools, detention facilities and various youth groups in Los Angeles County. 
Thus far, it has been completely funded by Toy, a motion picture camera 
assistant who lives in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances involve three brightly colored, large hand-held puppets with 
distinctive personalities and physical traits. 
</P>
<P>
 The play's premise is that long ago the world consisted of two towns, one made 
of sky, the other of ground. The inhabitants of the towns disliked each other 
because of their physical differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Groundtown creatures laughed at the wings flapping from the backs of 
Skytown dwellers, while the Skytowners mocked the groundlings' inability to 
fly. One day, peace comes between the two towns when a "Peace Box" is unlocked 
and a utopia that combines the best features of the land and sky emerges. This 
new place is called "Treetown."  
</P>
<P>
 The puppets, Mellie Monster, Artie Anteater and Dion Dragon, live in Treetown, 
Toy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mellie, the ringleader, is witty and domineering. Artie, her best friend, is 
just the opposite, goofy, but with a big heart. Dion, however, is shy, 
sensitive and insecure. He represents a lot of what foster children are going 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 The puppets tackle domestic problems common to most children and, with the 
help of the audience, work toward reaching peaceful solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 As "Penelope Peacekeeper," Toy narrates the puppets' predicaments and leads 
the children in discussion during two 15-minute sessions after each 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 One scenario involves a predicament faced by Mellie Monster, who will be 
having a birthday party and, with Artie Anteater, is attempting to compile a 
guest list. She agonizes over whether Dion Dragon should be invited because he 
has wings and is often made fun of by other children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mellie thinks that if she invites Dion, her classmates will laugh at her," 
Toy said. "I go over the importance of friendship with the audience and we 
discuss the various dragon stereotypes that might have led to the way Dion is 
treated. I ask them to then explain how each character feels in that situation. 
We point out how all three are different, but special in their own way -- just 
like humans." ANTONIO OLIVO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; BURGLAR BYPASSES REALTORS' LOCKBOXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A burglar in Sylmar has given a new meaning to the words "open house." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in the San Fernando Valley, a burglar has figured out how 
to bypass a security system designed to protect homes that are being shown by 
real-estate agents, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Sylmar homes have been burglarized since Oct. 7, when a thief broke into 
the electronic lockbox on the front door of a house, taking the key and walking 
away with valuables he found inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy is not a transient who is moving in and eating sandwiches," said 
Detective David Bashara of the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill 
Division. "There is a little bit of sophistication in this." 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the suspect isn't believed to be a real-estate agent, but rather 
could be using a sophisticated computer hacking method to develop key cards 
that break into the lockboxes. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the burglaries have been limited to under $5,000 in merchandise, 
mostly televisions and VCRs that can be pawned quickly, said Bashara. The 
houses that were burglarized are in the 13000 block of Hubbard, the 13700 block 
of Woodcock and the 14000 block of Tyler avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect has struck both day and night, but only when no one is home. 
Bashara would release no details about the suspect, except to say he is male. 
</P>
<P>
 The houses have been shown by three real-estate agencies, Bashara said. He 
refused to identify the agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley real estate agents have been using the lockboxes for the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, it's been a very localized problem in the Northeast Valley and I 
would hope it would not spread," said Mary Lou Williams, assistant executive 
vice president of the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors. "With today's 
technology, this is the most advanced and secure system that can be used. At 
this point in time, I'm not sure there is anything else we can use." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bashara had some advice for home sellers with lockboxes on their 
front doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a good idea is to let their neighbors know when they are leaving, and 
if someone does come, when they do leave, they are not leaving with a 
wheelbarrow," Bashara said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CSUN TO TEST VOTING BY TONE TELEPHONE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge will test touch-tone telephone voting this week, 
Associated Students President Fabio Escobar said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting at 6 a.m. Tuesday and continuing until 9 p.m. Wednesday, CSUN 
students will be able to call in their votes for school senate seats, 
homecoming queen and her court and two referendums. 
</P>
<P>
 To vote, students must call (818) 885-3000 and first enter their student 
identification number, birth date and a four-digit personal identification 
code, Escobar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the results will be computerized, Escobar said, the votes will be 
counted by 10 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's risky, but it's a good experiment," said Escobar, who supported using 
the new touch-tone voting system to increase the university's low voter 
turn-out, which is generally around 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The touch-tone system has met some opposition among student senators. Brad 
Stample said election costs have risen from $9,000 to $25,000 because of the 
implementation of the new technology needed for the touch-tone voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Stample also criticized the voting plan for being unorganized and too open to 
manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a student senator, and I haven't gotten my ballot in the mail yet," 
Stample said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that if he wants to receive his personal identification code and 
ballot, he will have to go to the admissions building to do so. MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUNLAND; POLICE VOW TO PATROL TUJUNGA WASH PONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department vowed Monday to improve patrols of the 
Tujunga Ponds, two watering holes in the Tujunga Wash that have become polluted 
by litter and are frequented by transients. 
</P>
<P>
 The promise came as a City Council panel on public safety discussed complaints 
from nearby residents who say that neither police nor Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies are patrolling the ponds. 
</P>
<P>
 The ponds are within unincorporated county land, which in most cases is 
patrolled by the Sheriff's Department. But they are surrounded by the city of 
Los Angeles, which is the jurisdiction of the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlene DeSanctis, chief field deputy for Councilman Joel Wachs, said residents 
have complained that when they call about transients and other problems at the 
ponds, both the police and the Sheriff's Department claim they do not have 
jurisdiction over the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been an ongoing problem," she told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 But police officials from the LAPD's Foothill Division said the ponds are part 
of their jurisdiction and they plan on making that clear to all police 
dispatchers and other officers who may get calls about the ponds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will fix it," said LAPD Capt. Robert Gale. "We will take care of that 
problem." HUGO MARTIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: AIRPORT TERMINAL GETTING SOME COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank Airport will soon have a new, more colorful look, an airport spokesman 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The repainting of the airport's terminal from light and dark gray to blue and 
white is progressing, said Victor Gill, an airport spokesman.The names of the 
seven airlines that serve the airport will be painted across the top of the 
terminal, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the terminal, last painted in 1988, will not be complete until the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a long distance, you would think the majority of it is done," Gill said. 
"But a lot of the finishing work is still under way." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the project, the green tile at the entrance to the terminal will be 
torn down and replaced with plaster to match the stucco material on the rest of 
the building, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport commissioners in August approved spending $114,000 to repaint the 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of another refurbishing project at the airport, passengers with 
disabilities will find it easier to get to the ticket counters, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Airport Commission approved $47,000 in renovations for handicapped 
accessibility Sept. 19. Workers will begin installing ramps for wheelchairs at 
the front entrance to the terminal the end of this month, and work is expected 
to be finished by Thanksgiving, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the wheelchair-accessible entrance is 40 feet to the right of the main 
entrance and is not convenient to all of the ticket counters, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer, the airport completed a project to make the signs around 
the terminal easier to read so that drivers can better get into the proper lane 
as they approach the airport, Gill said. ED BOND

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ORDONEZ TO HEAD POSTAL SERVICE AREA

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service has announced that Richard Ordonez of Oxnard has been 
named district manager of the Van Nuys Customer Service District, an area that 
stretches from Pasadena to San Luis Obispo to the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to continually strive to improve," said Ordonez in a statement."I 
believe we are headed in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which serves 4.5 million residents, covers nearly 35,000 square 
miles, said Terri Bouffiou, a spokeswoman for the Postal Service. The district 
has about 8,000 employees at more than 100 facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 Ordonez, who has been with the Postal Service 21 years, was born and reared in 
Oxnard. He has a degree in business administration from Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 He began his career as a part-time letter carrier in Ventura after serving 
four years in the Air Force.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, he was promoted to a management position at the Ventura Post Office 
and was named postmaster of Camarillo in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customer service and satisfaction are the two most important things that we 
can offer residents and businesses in the communities we serve," he said. "I am 
committed to delivering customer satisfaction along with the mail each day 
throughout the Van Nuys District." FRANK MANNING

RESIDENTS DECRY PLAN FOR SEPTIC DUMP SITE; ENVIRONMENT: NORTH VALLEY HOMEOWNERS 
OFFER CITY OFFICIALS A PETITION OF PROTEST. THEY FEAR STENCH, HEALTH HAZARDS, 
DECLINE IN PROPERTY VALUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeowners in the northern San Fernando Valley on Monday night voiced 
opposition to a city proposal to consider a Chatsworth site as a collection 
point for septic-tank waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're concerned about is the stench . . . health hazards from spills and 
collisions, and the associated decline in property values," said Winnetka 
resident Ove Larsen, who presented public works officials with a petition 
signed by more than 100 people who object to the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen people attended the meeting at the Northridge Recreation Center to 
get information about the proposed site at the west side of Winnetka Avenue 
between Nordhoff Street and the railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Reponen, an environmental manager for the Public Works Department, 
stressed that the purpose of the meeting was to present information about the 
proposed site, and that public comment would be taken at public hearings after 
a draft environmental study is released, probably in February or March. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the people who attended the meeting asked questions, but some 
protested the location, about a quarter-mile from a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth resident John Chady, who lives south of the site, said he can 
already smell odors from a nearby manufacturing company and a shampoo-bottling 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm really concerned about is the prevailing wind," Chady said. "What 
provisions would be made to seal the delivery systems from the wind?" 
</P>
<P>
 Don Bunts, a city consultant with HDR Engineering, answered that the potential 
for odors escaping would be "very low" because trucks using the facility would 
discharge waste through hoses, which would fit into specially constructed 
channels leading to a sewer line along Winnetka Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the first of two community meetings to be held in locales named as 
possible sites where septic tank waste would be collected for processing at the 
Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in the Sepulveda Basin.  
</P>
<P>
 A meeting to hear public comments on a site at 9701 San Fernando Road in Sun 
Valley will be held at 7 tonight in the Lake View Terrace Recreation Center, 
11075 Foothill Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 A third meeting, to discuss a Downtown Los Angeles site at the northeast 
corner of Jesse Street and Santa Fe Avenue, which was scheduled for Monday, has 
been canceled at the request of City Councilman Richard Alatorre, Reponen said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The waste-collection facility was nearly completed at Tillman last October, 
when the Board of Public Works -- under pressure from nearby homeowners, 
environmentalists and City Council member Laura Chick -- ordered city employees 
to complete an environmental study of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners argued that having 90 to 200 loads of septic-tank waste trucked 
into the facility -- as was originally projected -- would contaminate the 
surrounding Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tillman facility would have been the central dumping spot for septic-tank 
waste from the Valley and nearby cities, including Malibu and Calabasas. It was 
planned to pipe the waste from there to the Hyperion Treatment Plant in Playa 
del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the environmental study, the Public Works Department is required to 
consider alternative sites to the Tillman facility as the central dumping spot 
for septic-tank waste. Beginning in March, public works officials began 
developing an initial list of 70 potential alternatives, which was narrowed 
down to 19 and finally to three. 
</P>
<P>
 The study could recommend Tillman, another site or more than one site. 
Possible Sites for a Septic Waste Collection Facility The city has announced 
three alternative sites for a septic waste collection facility located, but not 
opened, at the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation 
Area. A community meeting will be held in Lake View Terrace tonight. Potential 
sites:

DEFENSE IN CHILD-MURDER CASE SEEKS SUPPRESSION OF EVIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The proceedings have a familiar ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense is seeking to suppress evidence obtained without a search warrant 
from the defendant's vehicle, which was parked on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys are also arguing that evidence obtained at the defendant's 
home with a search warrant should be thrown out because police conducted 
previous searches of the home prior to the warrant being issued. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense may also challenge DNA test results of blood stains found both in 
the vehicle and in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not another chapter in the double-murder trial of O.J. Simpson. This 
case involves the sexual assault and strangulation of an 8-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooman Ashkan Panah, 23, who lived across the courtyard from the girl's father 
in a sprawling apartment complex in Woodland Hills, is charged with the 
kidnaping and murder of young Nicole Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah -- who cut off his ponytail and appeared in court dressed in a purple 
suit with a purple pattern tie on Monday -- faces the death penalty if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days of testimony -- including an emotional breakdown by a veteran 
police detective -- the Van Nuys Superior Court hearing on pretrial motions to 
suppress evidence on Monday was continued to Nov. 1 because additional 
witnesses won't be available until then. 
</P>
<P>
 No new light was shed on the case so far, but Panah's attorney, Robert 
Sheahen, has attempted to show that police acted improperly in obtaining 
statements from Panah and in obtaining physical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter Berman on Friday, Detective 
Duane Burris was explaining the events leading up to the search of Panah's 
apartment the morning of Nov. 21, 1993. Burris said officers looked around the 
apartment -- including a bedroom closet containing suitcases, one which later 
that night was found to contain the girl's nude body -- but left after the girl 
was not found. 
</P>
<P>
 Burris said he then went to the apartment of Panah's girlfriend, who had 
called police to say that Panah had been there and had cut his wrists and 
swallowed sleeping pills in an attempted suicide and then fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah was spotted a few blocks away and detained by police. Burris was about 
to explain what he had asked Panah about Nicole, when the 25-year veteran of 
the Police Department suddenly became quiet and then tried to answer through a 
choked voice. Burris' eyes became watery as Judge Sandy R. Kriegler called a 
recess in the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned to the witness stand, Burris said that he asked Panah about 
the girl and that Panah muttered something about the girl being near a 
waterfall near Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah was taken to a hospital, where another officer, Detective Robert 
Peloquin, testified that he informed Panah of his Miranda rights to remain 
silent and have an attorney present. Peloquin said Panah understood his rights 
and waived them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was lucid and responsive," Peloquin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sheahen tried to suggest that Panah did not understand what he was doing 
because of the suicide attempt and because of drugs given to him at the 
hospital, including an antipsychotic medication called Haldol. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Sheahen questioned the nurse, Marilyn Whitman, who had injected the 
drug into Panah. Sheahen produced an instruction sheet that comes with the drug 
that said the maximum dosage should be .5 milligram. Panah was given 5 
milligrams, which Whitman said was the standard dosage given in injection form. 
She said the half-milligram dosage was for oral doses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheahen is also attempting to exclude from evidence a blood-stained notebook 
found in Panah's car, in which Panah apologized for the death of Nicole and 
blamed the killing on "psychotic, evil and powerful people." 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on DNA testing is scheduled for Nov. 14, and Kriegler said he would 
like to begin jury selection by the end of November, with the trial beginning 
in December.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The ex-director of finance of an Agoura Hills oil company Monday was sentenced 
to 33 months in prison for embezzling nearly $2.4 million from the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles ordered Marvin Jay 
Caukin, 46, of Palos Verdes to repay the entire amount and fined him $25,000.

UPHOLSTERER SLAIN IN SHOP; AREA'S 3RD RECENT KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The body of a man who had been shot to death was found Sunday evening by the 
owner of a small upholstery shop in Van Nuys, police said, the third homicide 
in that community in less than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 A body identified as that of Thomas Lamb, 33, was found just after 5 p.m. at 
the Upholstery Room where he worked in the 16400 block of Vanowen Street, 
police said.He had been shot in the upper chest, said Detective Stephen Fisk of 
the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 No motive for the crime was known, Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the business said they were shocked that Lamb, whom they 
described as a quiet man who occasionally bought cigarettes and Gatorade at the 
neighboring Alta Dena Dairy or a hamburger at Lumber Jack, was brutally killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This business has been here 45 years and it is a good area," said Jennie Kim, 
owner of the Lumber Jack hamburger stand, which shares the lot with the 
upholstery business and dairy. "Nothing like this has ever happened before." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, two elderly women were killed in separate attacks in Van Nuys, 
police said. Aliza Levi, 72, was killed when she startled a burglar in her home 
on Norwich Avenue Tuesday, Fisk said. A $25,000 reward is being offered for 
information leading to the arrest of her killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before, Berneda McMackin, 77, was set afire in her home after she was 
fatally beaten and stabbed. Police said they do not believe the slayings are 
connected.

MAN ARRESTED IN FATAL PACOIMA SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-year-old accused of fatally shooting a Pacoima man last month has been 
arrested in Fresno for the allegedly gang-related crime, Los Angeles police 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Phillips of Fresno was arrested Friday after he went to a scheduled 
meeting with his parole officer in the San Joaquin Valley city, said LAPD 
Detective Frank Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips is being held on suspicion of murder in the Sept. 26 slaying of Eric 
Blair, 27, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair and a group of men were talking outside a house at 12150 Garber St. in 
Pacoima when a gunman shot at them, striking Blair, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses later identified Phillips as the gunman, police said. Phillips 
disappeared after the shooting, but police now believe that was when he moved 
from Lake View Terrace to Fresno, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Phillips is a member of the Bloods street gang and that the 
men Blair was with during the shooting were also Bloods. There is no evidence 
that Blair was a gang member, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Philips was being held Monday in Fresno County Jail without bail.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; MISSION COLLEGE CLOSER TO ITS NICHE AT 20TH BIRTHDAY, LEADER 
SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its 20th anniversary approaching in February, Mission College in Sylmar 
has come a long way from its humble beginnings in a collection San Fernando 
storefronts in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus, the youngest in the nine-campus Los Angeles Community College 
District, moved to its permanent 22.5-acre campus site in the fall of 1991. But 
with only a handful of permanent buildings and a site one-quarter of the size 
considered normal, it still has a long way to go toward becoming a full-fledged 
community college. 
</P>
<P>
 President Jack Fujimoto, 65, who began as a city schools teacher in 1959, 
arrived in 1989 to help spearhead the transition. Prospects for rapid growth 
and expansion dimmed when the college's enrollment, at its peak more than 7,400 
students in 1992, fell to fewer than 6,000 this fall, reflecting both statewide 
enrollment declines and the impact of the Northridge earthquake in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujimoto, who said he hopes to stay at the campus several more years, talked 
of how he has tried the steer the college into a closer relationship with the 
surrounding East Valley community. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Give us an assessment of Mission College as it reaches its 20 - year 
anniversary.  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Mission College has always been, at least in my mind, a free spirit 
where people try things. People do things, and even if you fail, nobody 
criticizes you for failing. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's happening is we're finding consolidation of facilities and people 
to the new campus, and that's really a traumatic experience. It's like bringing 
the family together and the facilities are too small for the big family. So 
now, three years later, people are saying, "20th anniversary." But we're sort 
of locked in. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does Mission have a different role from your sister colleges in being more 
outwardly directed to community involvement?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. I'm taking it that way purposely, because my concept of a community 
college is it's a college in a community, and we need to help the community 
develop. I see some of that from President Mary Lee at Pierce College. But I 
don't see as much as we try to do. We're in economic development activities, 
social development and community activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Describe a couple of things the college is doing in those areas.  
</P>
<P>
 A: If we look at earthquake recovery, one of the first things that hit us was 
we lost about 1,000 students right off. But at the same time we were out in the 
community, counseling small business and community folks and helping them get 
loans from FEMA and SBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Another activity is what we call the Blythe Street project. What in essence 
happened in Blythe Street is Mission College opened a kitchen. We train 
immigrant vendors on the standards of good health and nutrition for them to 
sell their wares. In a community where we have gangs and poverty as problems, 
and immigrants as an issue, we've gone in and we've helped a population. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are some of Mission College's main weaknesses at the moment?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think one of the weaknesses has to be not being able to meet the needs of 
the people in the community as they've expressed them. For instance, the Sylmar 
residents' group has complained so much about on-street parking, and students 
don't park in the parking lots here because there aren't enough parking spaces. 
Facilities are another problem. We don't have large classrooms. We don't have 
large offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is the content of the programs you offer here different from what you're 
going to find at the other district campuses?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think we're much more non-traditional, meaning that because we don't have 
a lot of faculty, many of them are going to teach day, evening, split programs, 
four-day weeks, Saturdays. And our classrooms are going at least six days a 
week. I don't find that in the other colleges as much. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, we're still a relatively young college. We borrow from the other 
colleges in terms of the courses and programs. What Mission College needs to do 
is find its own niche where it is going to do well. Yet at the same time, we 
don't want to fall into the niche that says, "You're a remedial school." And we 
don't want to be known as a Hispanic college only, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's talk about students. When students come to Mission, do they differ 
from those going to the other campuses in the district?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Those who go to Valley and Pierce colleges I think are much more the 
traditional college-bound student. The college-going rate of students around 
Mission College is much smaller. Many of the students who come here are the 
first ones in the family. And the family is mostly saying, "We have an economic 
struggle and you need to help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Traditionally, community colleges have several goals for their students: 
transfers to four-year institutions, vocational education, and basic skills 
such as remedial programs. How does Mission fit into those categories?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think Mission College has done well in terms of transfer. We've 
made significant progress in the time I've been here. But the numbers are very 
small. In terms of vocational certificates, we give a lot of certificates. But 
what we need to do is track those individuals to say, "What's that particular 
certificate done for you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are students typically looking to accomplish when they are done at 
Mission College?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They want to transfer to the Cal State or University of California systems. 
They want that, but their expectations are a little higher than what their 
abilities are. So therefore they become tailored very quickly to a vocational 
goal. About 60% come in hoping to transfer, but it becomes about 60% 
certificate- or vocational-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is there that divergence in the expectations of your students and their 
abilities?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Basically society's values. I think as a parent I want my kid to go into 
something that's going to produce some bucks for them, or at least a 
comfortable living. But the student may not have the same abilities, because 
whatever he learned up to this point isn't going to get him there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Mission is third in the district in terms of its Latino student proportion. 
For incoming students, is the language issue something you have to deal with 
and how?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Many will be very strong in Spanish, and so in the initial contact, we have 
to have people who speak Spanish give them some guidance. But as time goes on, 
I think that pretty much starts to fall by the wayside because many of them 
pick up English-language skills very readily. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There were some developments in the state budget this year as far as 
Mission's plans for the future. Can you summarize what happened?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We were able to get about $4.5 million in the governor's budget to start 
negotiating with the county for another 40 acres to expand into the adjoining 
golf course or El Cariso Regional Park. In the coming year, I see an 
educational master plan coming, an environmental impact report and a facilities 
master plan. And we can use those as a backdrop for the 20th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have other plans for the future?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Mission College has roughly about 150 foreign students now. I'd want to 
expand that into about 500 foreign students to make us much more cosmopolitan. 
One of the things we don't have is apartments. But if we start developing some 
kind of dormitory system or agreements with apartment owners, then that opens 
it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Financially, you have a reputation as someone who goes out and tries to 
develop outside grant funding. Is Mission different from the other campuses in 
that regard and why?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Survival. Because we need the external funds. Budgets are based on 
full-time equivalent students. But the students who come here don't take a lot 
of courses. They're not the type that can manage 21 units or 24 units at a 
crack. So the number of full-time students is not that great. The only way we 
can keep on top of things is by going out and saying, "We're the little kid on 
the block, we're just growing up, we need a lot of money."

EARLY-MORNING FIRE GUTS JAPANESE RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire gutted a Japanese restaurant in Van Nuys Monday morning, causing 
$150,000 in damage but no injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Fire Department investigators said the blaze was started by 
combustible materials that were stored too close to a water heater in the back 
of the restaurant, said spokesman Brian Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out about 7:10 a.m. at Kyushu Ramen, located in a mini-mall at 
15355 Sherman Way near Sepulveda Boulevard, Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The business was closed at the time of the fire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters put the blaze out in about 20 minutes and were able to prevent it 
from spreading, Humphrey said.

IN THE DANGER ZONE; RICHARD PRESTON WAS BORN TO TELL THE TRUE STORY OF A DEADLY 
VIRUS OUTBREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By D.T. MAX, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Preston has a knack for getting into wherever he wants and coaxing 
information from whomever he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that I'm a gifted writer, but I believe I am a gifted 
listener," says the 40-year-old author, who is in fact both. "When I talk to 
someone, I just keep hearing their sentences over and over in my head even when 
I'm asleep. And when you get fascinated by something, people open up." 
</P>
<P>
 His just-published bestseller, "The Hot Zone" (Random House), is a mesmerizing 
real-life variation on "Andromeda Strain" about a near-catastrophic outbreak of 
a tropical virus called Ebola Reston in suburban Virginia in 1989. To bring the 
story to life, Preston needed to persuade the Army -- not exactly dying to 
rehash biological threats -- to cooperate extensively. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Preston wanted to experience a "Level 4" virus hot room. Level 4 
viruses such as Ebola Reston are by definition lethal, highly contagious, have 
no cure and no vaccine. (By comparison, anthrax is a Level 2 virus; HIV, a 
Level 3.) 
</P>
<P>
 Because a terrorist who obtained a test tube of Level 4 virus could hold a 
city hostage, there are only two containment labs that work with them -- both 
highly secure and open only to a handful of specially trained epidemiologists 
clad in spacesuits. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1993, when Preston asked USAMRIID (pronounced "You Sam Rid"), the U.S. 
Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases in Frederick, Md., to 
let him take a peek at theirs, they obliged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually they were reluctant to let me in less for security reasons than 
because people tend to panic in there," Preston says. "An earlier visitor 
suffered an attack of claustrophobia and ripped his helmet off and they had to 
give him an emergency decon (decontamination) shower." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Cambridge, Mass., to a lawyer father and a mother who taught art 
history, Preston graduated in 1977 from Pomona College, which he loved, 
majoring in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuck on what to do next, he went east to Princeton University as a graduate 
student. There he met his wife, Michelle, and settled down. Today they have 
three children, ages 6 months to 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, all Preston has done for a living is write, beginning in 
Princeton's development office, ignominiously "ghost-writing letters to 
corporations and wealthy people begging for money," a task one can imagine him 
excelling at. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I learned about people I learned from my mother. She was like the 
unofficial caseworker of Wellesley, Mass., where we lived. She would get deeply 
involved in people's lives and become deeply sympathetic to them. I learned 
that skill of being able to lose oneself, wash away oneself, enter into the 
mind of someone else. You project into their mind and see the world as they see 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving on to more substantial game, Preston brought his ingenuous smile, his 
permanent look of sympathy crossbred with enthusiasm, and his perpetually ready 
memo pads to astronomers working on Caltech's Hale telescope in "First Light" 
(Atlantic Monthly Press, 1987) and then to metalworkers looking for a new way 
to pour sheet steel in "American Steel" in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "First Light" earned him $45,000. "American Steel," published by a division of 
Simon & Schuster Inc. then in the process of dissolving, made more than 
$100,000, but there were still times, he says, when he didn't have mortgage 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advance comes in and for a while you're living pretty well," he says. 
"And then the money runs out." 
</P>
<P>
 So nothing prepared him for the enthusiasm that would race through the 
literary world and Hollywood beginning in the fall of 1992, when the New Yorker 
published the article that would grow into "The Hot Zone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now he sits in the house that "The Hot Zone" built -- six bedrooms in suburban 
Princeton, N.J. The living room is large with a stone fireplace and extensive 
collections of John McPhee and A.J. Liebling, both nonfiction writers whom, 
along with Henry Thoreau, Preston particularly admires. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a gray shirt, blue jeans, brown loafers and white socks a la 
perennial grad student, hair tousled and prematurely gray, the boyish Preston 
wolfs down a piece of pizza, drinks a glass of wine and seems unfazed by the 
piece of animal spleen loaded with deadly Ebola virus particles -- sterilized 
and shielded by acrylic plastic to be sure -- that sits nearby as a souvenir 
from an Army friend. 
</P>
<P>
 On his oak mantelpiece are a drinking bowl from Lake Turkana and an East 
African gourd, both of which he bought in Nairobi where he went in the fall of 
1993 to visit Kitum Cave, the suspected host site for the Marburg virus, which 
is closely related to Ebola. He dressed in a portable spacesuit, entered the 
caves and found . . . nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admit the book would have had a better ending if I'd blown up with the 
virus," he says. Instead, "my heart just pounded." 
</P>
<P>
 The long route that led Preston, dressed like the Michelin man, to an obscure 
Kenyan cave likely carved by the tusks of salt-seeking elephants has a complex 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the rest of the world, Preston had paid scant attention to a syndicated 
1989 article about an outbreak of a rare virus among a group of medical 
research monkeys in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that the virus might get out into the suburban population, USAMRIID 
had quietly seized the building and decontaminated it, killing about 500 
monkeys in the process, a gruesome and elaborate episode that Preston handles 
in the book without blinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not callous to suffering," he says, "but I'm a journalist and I have to 
describe accurately." 
</P>
<P>
 Ebola Reston, as the virus was later named, turned out to be a Level 4 virus, 
a relative of Ebola Zaire, one of the most virulent viruses ever to strike 
humanity. But thanks to some skillful Army subterfuge and fourth-estate 
laziness, no one got the connection between an animal-euthanizing operation in 
a suburban office park and the reality that for those few weeks, several 
million lives around Washington, D.C., were at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is by the time I called, basically the Army had started to forget 
Reston," Preston says. "They had not gotten a lot of attention for what they 
had done, and they were extremely happy that they had gone in there and done it 
without a lot of people getting killed and the Army getting blamed for some 
sort of bio-disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Preston had forgotten the clipping, too, but the subject preoccupied him more 
generally. He believed it was just a matter of time before a virus emerged from 
the fast-diminishing rain forest and, in the language of epidemiology, "burned" 
its way through the overpopulated planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was drawn . . . by a general sense of talking around in the scientific 
community that the AIDS virus is the tip of the iceberg," he says. That was 
when expert virologists reminded him of the Reston outbreak and he picked up 
the phone and called USAMRIID. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't know who I was or what I wanted," he says. "My first phone call 
in 1992 caused a lot of nervousness. There's a natural gut level mistrust of 
journalists in the Army. They want to know what your agenda is." 
</P>
<P>
 He was granted a single interview with the husband and wife who led the 
decontamination mission, Col. Jerry and Lt. Col. Nancy Jaax, the chief 
veterinarian and pathologist of USAMRIID respectively, who would be major 
figures in the book. They provided him with the story and, more importantly, 
with characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided instantly after doing the interview with Jerry, Nancy and also 
Peter Jahrling (a USAMRIID civilian who has the name of his favorite deadly 
virus on his license plate), I wanted to write the story. I don't think they 
had an awareness of just how interesting the Reston crisis and their work was. 
The basic outlines of the book all came out in that interview, their 
autobiographies and their sense of their interior life." 
</P>
<P>
 Preston told the New Yorker magazine, with which he had an informal, 
longstanding relationship, of his project and got his expenses covered. It was 
the story he was born to write. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm passionately interested in is not science but American lives," he 
explains, "and I especially love to write about people whose lives appear 
normal but are actually deeply atypical, like the Jaaxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was struck by how the officers involved in this mission went home to 
perfectly normal homes. And I think it was fascinating that USAMRIID soldiers 
(whose basic job is to look after livestock being held for vaccine research) 
went into a place the Army Rangers would have been scared to go into. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also love to explore the zone of contact between nature and human beings. 
All my books are about that in one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
 A gift for putting science into layman's prose and a sharp eye for detail 
stood Preston in good stead working on his magazine article, one of the most 
admired pieces of its year and a finalist for a National Magazine Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Preston's agent soon sold "Crisis in the Hot Zone," with its title shortened 
by two words and its length expanded by a factor of six, to Random House for 
about $350,000. In publishing, you takes your money and you makes your tour, 
but Preston, slated for a 15-city jag, offered to cancel if his wife found 
being at home alone with their three small children too onerous. As spouses 
generally do in such moments, she declined. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And then Hollywood came calling. In a widely reported story, "Crisis in the 
Hot Zone" engendered a nasty footrace between 20th Century Fox, which optioned 
it for director Ridley Scott and actors Robert Redford and Jodie Foster, and a 
competing Warner Bros. project from an original script set to star Dustin 
Hoffman and Rene Russo. 
</P>
<P>
 Tension over whom the script should feature derailed Fox's project, leaving 
Preston with the $100,000 option money and considerable bitterness. He calls 
the Warner Bros. picture "a high-budget rip-off," adding: "My feelings are that 
my lawyers are going to watch very carefully and see what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But even the knowledge that someone is likely to make tens of millions of 
dollars at his expense doesn't much tamp his enthusiasm. He has had a career 
year, giving him a margin of economic safety for the first time, and more time 
for backpacking and canoeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Preston came home from his fast ride through "The Hot Zone" with one other 
rather unwelcome guest as well: a touch of hypochondria. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find myself feeling a little apprehensive now when in an enclosed space 
with a lot of strange people," he says. "I don't much like traveling on the 
subway anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the likely success of the book, it's unlikely he'll have to.

THE SPRING COLLECTIONS / PARIS; RETRO REVUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL / TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A packed house waited Monday for the arrival of Madonna & Co. so the Chanel 
show could begin. The singer may be having image problems back home, but her 
presence at the spring-summer 1995 fashion shows here have helped keep the 
glamour quotient as high off the runway as on it. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour late -- and after a rumbling dirge by impatient photographers -- the 
show got on the road. Sans Madonna. But her influence was everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Karl Lagerfeld have her in mind when he whipped up a group of 
bondage-inspired cocktail dresses? Or when he created tiny boucle skirts that 
unzipped from the bottom, permitting a bird's-eye view of the models' sequined 
panty-covered crotches? 
</P>
<P>
 And there's the larger question: Are Chanel's best customers really going to 
leave the house in sheer black mesh gowns and glittery G-strings? 
</P>
<P>
 "I would," said one woman, "if they'd sell me the body to go with it." 
Wouldn't we all? 
</P>
<P>
 Lagerfeld's favorite model, Claudia Schiffer, pranced down the runway in a 
breathtaking array of sexy, glamorous clothes and under the watchful eye of her 
fiance, magician David Copperfield. The beautiful Helena Christensen was 
watched by her rock star boyfriend, Michael Hutchins of INXS. And, as always, 
Kyle MacLachlan carried the flame for Linda Evangelista -- who looked as if she 
would have preferred to be elsewhere. (Who can blame her? Enough already.) 
</P>
<P>
 This much is true: There's nothing casual about a Chanel summer. A woman who 
cares to live the fantasy wears a sequined bikini, a spray of glitter on her 
buttocks, rhinestone-encrusted sunglasses and four-inch-high patent leather 
mules. Sort of gives new meaning to the term "beach bunny." 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the Chanel accessories for spring are irreverent and self-mocking: 
white leather driving gloves with the double C logo, rhinestone anklets and 
square quilted handbags. Most outrageous of all, though, were the shoes. 
Especially the two-tone patent leather gillies, in lemon and fuchsia. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the house pays tribute to its long dead founder, Chanel is one of 
only a few forward-looking collections to be shown here. Lagerfeld emphasized 
the point musically by playing the theme from "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
 A song that better summed up the diverse ideas about feminine beauty exhibited 
during the past seven days was played at no fewer than three fashion shows:  
</P>
<P>
 If everybody knew what they wanted.  
</P>
<P>
 People would see with clarity.  
</P>
<P>
 If everybody knew what they wanted.  
</P>
<P>
 There'd be no suffering.  
</P>
<P>
 And judging by the collections, the indecision has only just begun. 
</P>
<P>
 With the end of the century in sight, designers have shifted into a 
retrospective mode. So while hemlines have dropped and daytime dressing has 
gone dressy, everything else about next season's clothes is all over the 
chronological map. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood sirens, Gibson girls, Grecian goddesses, Elvis impersonators, 
corsetted wenches, disco queens and Sabrina wanna-bes have clamored for the 
spotlight. Only Jean Paul Gaultier managed to mix them up in a way that hinted 
at our retro future.  
</P>
<P>
 Fashion visionary Vivienne Westwood has mined historic reference for years, of 
course, lampooning ideas about status, class and femininity. She continued to 
do so this season with a widely theatrical, jam-packed collection that 
attracted a mob of London fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The corset, a staple of the season, has been part of Westwood's fashion 
vocabulary for the entire decade. Now, her bustle, which in the past struck 
many as freakish, has made its way into the most mainstream collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Hermes, known for its saddlery and scarves, finished off its show of 
classic sportswear with shiny, color-saturated cocktail dresses with cascading 
layers of fabric accentuating the derriere. And Herve Leger, maker of the 
form-fitting rubber-band dresses that starlets love, showed waist-nipping 
silhouettes that flared at the fanny with the help of dense crinolines. 
</P>
<P>
 The suddenly-hot-again Paco Rabanne has attracted a second generation of 
followers. This is partly due to a best-selling book he has written about his 
experiences with aliens. And partly because he's hired two very good, very 
young assistant designers who have returned the house of Rabanne to its 
original hard-edged, hardware-trimmed clothes. Bring on the chain mail.

HOW BEST TO TACKLE WEIGHT PROBLEM?; LIFESTYLES: THOSE EXTRA POUNDS WE'RE 
CARRYING WEIGH HEAVY ON THE MINDS OF EXPERTS. BUT THEY CAN'T AGREE ON HOW TO 
GET US TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTH. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite a plethora of dieting and the kaleidoscopic weight-loss industry, 
Americans are gaining weight, not losing it. And since overweight contributes 
to diseases such as arthritis, hypertension, colon cancer, diabetes and 
coronary heart disease, the problem has become a public health crisis of 
epidemic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 So said a panel of 18 experts who collaborated on a set of "healthy weight" 
recommendations issued after a daylong American Health Foundation round-table 
conference held here earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to Europe, obesity is a disgrace in this nation," said Dr. Ernst L. 
Wynder, foundation president. "Weight is a major factor in disease and 
preventive medicine begins in part with a healthy weight. We need a campaign 
similar to the anti-smoking effort of the '80s and the cholesterol awareness 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Added former U.S. surgeon general Dr. C. Everett Koop: "Television and 
commercials have really contributed (to obesity) and it also stems from 
psychological and spiritual sources. To our shame, we've done almost nothing 
about this threat to our health." 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations, issued in the form of a consensus statement, provide a 
healthy-weight table based on the Body Mass Index -- a scientific measure 
calculated from height and weight. Overweight people are also advised that even 
modest weight losses can lead to a "healthier weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some experts question the idea of putting more pressure on a society 
already plagued with a largely unsuccessful diet frenzy. They also question the 
value of publicizing more weight tables, which they say could confuse consumers 
and cause more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really shocked and disappointed," said Healthy Weight Journal Editor 
Frances Berg, who attended the conference as an observer. "This isn't like 
quitting smoking. There are many health risks associated with losing weight and 
already a national obsession with thinness." 
</P>
<P>
 Berg, who is also a nutritionist and adjunct professor at the University of 
North Dakota School of Medicine, said the foundation's healthy-weight numbers 
-- which are stricter benchmarks than some other tables that show a range of 
acceptable weights -- are a "step backward" and will do damage, especially to 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see four dangers here," Berg said. "(They) create greater potential for 
eating disorders, harm from dangerous weight-loss methods, prejudice against 
large people and abuses of the kind already seen from the weight-loss 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, counters Johanna Dwyer, a Tufts University School of Medicine 
professor and member of the foundation panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations, she said, "are a release from (social) pressure. The 
emphasis is to get your weight lower even if you can't reach perfection. We're 
saying any modest weight loss is positive rather than negative, and that an 
emphasis should be on not gaining more weight. There are a lot of people out 
there who haven't gotten that message." 
</P>
<P>
 Added fellow panel member Sachiko St. Jeor, a professor of clinical medicine 
at the University of Nevada: "The point is to get a simple and practical 
message out there that takes a stand and isn't wishy-washy. We're setting a 
healthy weight goal, an upper limit associated with the least disease." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The debate about what constitutes healthy weight isn't new, nor is the notion 
of guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Karil Bialostosky, a U.S. Department of research fellow for nutrition policy, 
said the term "healthy weight" was coined in 1990 by an advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted some word other than the term 'desirable weight,' " she said. 
"The word healthy makes the concept less ambiguous and connects it more 
properly to a health-based use." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, precisely defining "healthy weight" was difficult, so the committee 
recommended an interim definition that included three components: weight, 
distribution of fat and health status. 
</P>
<P>
 Those and other recommendations resulted in the agency's 1990 Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans, a 27-page pamphlet that is being revised by a newly 
formed advisory committee and will be reissued in December, 1995, Bialostosky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some confusion and controversy with the 1990 healthy-weight 
guidelines because people focused only on the weight table instead of all three 
components," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the American Health Foundation recommendations, Bialostosky said Health and 
Human Services has no official position. "It's a real tough and controversial 
issue that many people have questions about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So just how overweight are we? 
</P>
<P>
 One study -- the ongoing Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, conducted 
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- reports an overweight rate 
of about 26%, with Arizonans being the least overweight (20%) and 
Mississippians the most overweight (32%). Californians log in around the 
middle, at about 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Another study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. in July, 
showed an 8% increase in the number of overweight Americans over the past 
decade, and said that despite multi-billion-dollar annual dieting expenditures, 
one-third of American adults -- about 58 million people -- are overweight. 
Collectively, we've each gained an average of about 8 pounds, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert J. Kuczmarski of the National Center for Health Statistics, who 
co-authored the JAMA study, said it is incorrect to say that Americans have 
been steadily gaining weight, as reported in the American Health Foundation 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't find a steady increase in overweight prevalence," he said. "From 
1960 to 1980, it was fairly flat, with a sudden jump between 1980 and 1991." 
</P>
<P>
 He said there is no one reason for the increase during the diet- and 
fitness-crazed 1980s. He cites several factors, including "the decrease in 
smoking, the increase in fast-food restaurants, the use of VCRs and jobs where 
people sit glued to their computers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Satter, a Wisconsin registered dietitian and eating therapist, said the 
outmoded way of looking at body weight has created the problems we have today. 
The field is now undergoing a "paradigm shift," she said, resulting in a 
confused public. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have the old paradigm group that sees weight as being optional, something 
you can get by eating and exercise," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new way of thinking, which Satter subscribes to, abnormal body weight 
is what's atypical for the individual, not something that can be defined by 
outside or collective measures. "The thing to do is eat and exercise in a 
healthy fashion and accept the weight that grows out of that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been an awful lot of agony taking place over weight reduction," she 
said. "It's like beating a dead horse."

BODY WATCH; CANCER; IT'S STILL A FRIGHTENING DISEASE, BUT CLEAR GAINS ARE BEING 
MADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One in every five deaths in the United States is from cancer. But a closer 
look at statistics shows that clear gains are being made to reduce the 
incidence and death rates of certain types of the disease, while other cancers 
remain problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Cancer Society's 1994 statistics are notable for the large jump 
in estimated new cases of prostate cancer -- an increase of 21% over the 1993 
rate. But this increase is most likely a result of more men undergoing a 
relatively new screening test -- called prostate-specific antigen -- to detect 
the disease early. 
</P>
<P>
 One bright light in the statistics is breast cancer, which shows no change 
from the 1993 estimates. Breast cancer still makes up 32% of all new cases of 
cancer in women, but officials say they are encouraged that the incidence rate 
has stabilized after years of steady growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Another promising statistic is lung cancer in men, which continues to drop as 
fewer men smoke. The lung cancer rate in women is still rising, although at a 
slower rate than seen in the 1970s. 1994 Estimated Cancer Incidence by Site in 
Men Melanoma of Skin: 3% Oral: 3% Lung: 16% Pancreas: 2% Stomach: 2% Colon & 
Rectum: 12% Urinary: 9% Prostate: 32% Leukemia & Lymphomas: 7% All Others: 12%

BODY WATCH; WANNA GET FIT? TRY GETTING LUCKY; LUCKY VANOUS, THE HUNK FROM THE 
DIET COKE ADS, IS TURNING HIS TALENTS (AND HIS PECS) TO A WORKOUT VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone and her brother, it seems, have a great idea for an exercise video. 
</P>
<P>
 And invitations to view production tapings are as common as broken treadmills 
at cheap health clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 But when another invite arrived asking us to sit in on the taping of a new 
fitness video starring Lucky Vanous, well, suddenly, it seemed a good idea to 
alert fitness-minded readers to what's due on the video market come January. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't know the name, you probably know the pecs. Vanous is better known 
as that hunk construction worker who bares his chest in the Diet Coke 
commercial while female office workers drool and ogle from overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 So we sped down to A & M Studios on LaBrea, a watch-your-hubcaps kind of 
neighborhood, and settled in. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Lucky, all 6 feet, 2 inches of him, tanned and sweating in a black 
tank top and black shorts, working out under mercilessly hot lights with a 
woman in a black leotard and tights. (Didn't catch her name -- kidding! She's 
Kacy Duke, a well-known fitness expert who shares the stage with The Luckster, 
but more about her later.) 
</P>
<P>
 As the production people fussed with mikes and sound levels and coaxed retake 
after retake, marketing types sat behind the monitors and whispered pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The video will run 45 minutes," said Laura Sullivan of CBS/Fox Video, which 
is producing the project. The tape includes a five-minute warm-up, 30 minutes 
of cardiovascular work and strength-training, and a 10-minute cool-down. 
Instructions are geared to three fitness levels: basic, energy and power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The choreography is simple," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 As in . . . even guys could follow it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it's definitely a unisex workout," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, but has there been any market research, Laura, on which gender might be 
more likely to snatch this $14.98 tape off the shelf? 
</P>
<P>
 "Women," she said with a laugh, further categorizing them as "fitness 
enthusiasts" and "others who want to look at Lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, legions out there -- all ages, shapes and fitness levels 
-- who want to look at Lucky. On TV, on the street, wherever he appears. (Never 
mind that the New York City resident is happily married to model Kristen Noel 
Vanous.) 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Coke commercial began airing in January on network and cable TV, 
Vanous has become a household chest. 
</P>
<P>
 He's still amazed, he said during a lunch-break interview, at the reaction to 
one commercial, especially since he's hawked at least a dozen other products -- 
"American Airlines, baby shampoo, beer." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the 33-year-old Nebraska native has also worked as a print model 
for major men's fashion magazines. His discovery by a New York modeling agent 
happened when Lucky was vacationing there with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 In person, he's the opposite of a macho, rough-around-the-edges construction 
worker. He makes a point of opening doors for women. When a makeup person 
offers to freshen him up for a TV taping, he's more concerned about her missing 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 So, why the video? 
</P>
<P>
 For months, Vanous said, friends and business associates had suggested it 
would be a good project now, given the familiarity bred by the Coke commercial. 
"But I have zero experience in video," Vanous said. 
</P>
<P>
 And although he's exercised regularly since 18 -- running and weights are his 
usual regimen to maintain his weight at 190 -- he was uncomfortable touting 
himself as the fitness guru du jour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to have a trainer train me and then do the video," he said. "I 
didn't want to come across as the expert. I wanted to be honest." He'd known 
Duke for years and it seemed a natural collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one knows for sure what will end up on the finished product -- titled 
"Lucky Vanous: The Ultimate Fat-Burning Workout" -- here's what the monitors 
showed during an hour of taping last month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Close-ups of Lucky's biceps and triceps as he lifted hand weights. 
</P>
<P>
 * Close-ups of Lucky's calves as he ran in place, demonstrating the 
cardiovascular part of the workout. 
</P>
<P>
 * Close-ups of Lucky's tanned face, hazel eyes and short brown hair as he 
talked about the right way to use hand weights. 
</P>
<P>
 So how much pec exposure can you expect for your 15 bucks? 
</P>
<P>
 In the weight-training and cardio segments, taped in Los Angeles, Lucky kept 
on his tank top. And because he's not into nudity-for-the-sake-of -- he's said 
to have declined newspaper photographers' requests to shed his shirt -- he will 
only toss his tank top for the stomach exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there plans for a sequel? Doesn't look that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping this will buy me peace and quiet," said Vanous, whose next goal is 
to resume acting lessons.

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: IN SEARCH OF HIP HANGOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 The international fashion crowd doesn't travel all the way here to hide in 
hotel rooms at day's end. When the last corset is loosened from some model's 
19-inch waist, the scramble's on to find the hippest hangout.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a tricky business. Do you settle for supper at an anonymous bistro with 
perfectly lovely colleagues? Or hold out for an invitation to one of the city's 
hot spots? We mulled that one over for about 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Call us superficial, but darn it, the duck at Dave, the grooviest Chinese 
restaurant in town, tastes better when you're in the company of Clint 
Eastwood's daughter, model Allison Eastwood, and her handsome photographer 
boyfriend. And when the love-struck couple showed us their matching tattoos, 
well, please pass the plum sauce! 
</P>
<P>
 Allison, a tall blond with a turned-up nose and unweathered skin, made her 
runway debut at the start of the spring shows last week. With the help of a 
backstage walking coach, she didn't fall once (which is more than can be said 
of Claudia Schiffer in her inauspicious debut). 
</P>
<P>
 Over at a corner table, designer Helmut Lang hosted a post-show gathering of 
models and photographers, while holding court at a banquet-size table opposite 
were L.A. attorney Jack Quinn and his well-connected wife, Joan (Chatter 
magazine), who shared platters with Paris-based modeling agency owner Marilyn 
Gauthier. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Celebrity Model Score Card: MTV's resident right-wing sex pistol, Kennedy, so 
enchanted designer Jean Paul Gaultier during a recent meeting that he invited 
her to model in his show. We suspect the designer was impressed with Kennedy's 
skillful handling of the microphone at the recent MTV Music Awards. We 
certainly were. At any rate, Gaultier flew in Kennedy and her mother (face it, 
the girl needs a chaperon). 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy looked amazingly great when she hit the runway, but she undercut the 
effect by stumbling and joking her way down the catwalk.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Friday show's biggest draw was Gaultier fan extraordinaire Madonna. We 
adore her but had to agree with ruthless observers who declared her "stocky." 
She appeared last, in the post-bride position, dressed in a see-through gown 
and pushing a carriage. The "baby" was -- surprise! -- a little white-haired 
doggy. Get it? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Instead of Pastrami, Cassoulet: Billed as the gathering spot for the most 
beautiful women in Paris and the local intelligentsia, La Coupole looked to our 
untutored eye more like Canter's on a Saturday night. If, that is, Picasso, 
Chagall and Brancusi had gussied up the place. And if Fellini had cast the 
parts of the diners.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, perhaps he had. Midway through our steak frite, Zsa Zsa Gabor and her 
husband, the Prince, appeared at our table. "You know, darling," she said, "I'm 
leaving for Hungary tomorrow to make a film." Then she opened up her tres chic 
corduroy jacket to show off a stylish gauzy black dress. "These are all from 
London," she said, as if someone had actually asked.

 At intermission, Nancy Van Tuyle was surrounded by admirers after she 
conducted the Pasadena Symphony through the national anthem at the opening 
performance of its 67th season Saturday night. "What I wanted was to show 
people what fun it was to be really involved," Van Tuyle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Robert, had secured the honor for her by making the winning bid 
at last season's gala fund-raiser. "I recognize some of these gestures," he 
said teasingly as he showed photographs of his wife on the podium, hands 
pointed and awhirl, during rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Symphony's real conductor, Jorge Mester, marking his 10th anniversary as 
music director, was the focus of celebration at the black-tie dinner held in 
the Gold Room of the Pasadena Civic Auditorium before the concert. His portrait 
graced the cover of the program in a painting titled "Conducting the Dawn," 
created by Pasadena artist Peter Adams.  
</P>
<P>
 Also honored were major donors, including Alyce and Warren Williamson and 
Elvera and Allan Fink, who were presented with a set of medals commemorating 
the 100th anniversary of Tchaikovsky's death. 
</P>
<P>
 A party before the concert needs to be a well-timed affair. "Was that the 
dinner chime?" asked Dennis Lowe when one of the ice sculptures at the caviar 
counter in the lobby crashed to the carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we kept the orchestra waiting. We don't want to do it again," he 
explained, encouraging the guests to move on from the cocktail reception to the 
dinner of chilled watercress and leek soup, prawns, chicken, petit filet and a 
rich chocolate dessert. The evening was underwritten by Wells Fargo and KKGO 
FM.  
</P>
<P>
 Lowe and his wife, Shelly, hosted two tables. At an adjacent table, Delores 
Kroop -- who shares orchestra special events duties, including the upcoming 
Holiday Weekend in December, with Lowe -- was with her husband, Richard; their 
children Gabrielle and Benjamin; Madeleine and John Moran, and Fern and Jason 
Wallach.  
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Schultz, president of the Symphony Assn., moved the brief presentation 
of the medals along swiftly so everyone was able to take their concert seats 
promptly to enjoy the music of the night, which featured Nadja 
Salerno-Sonnenberg's rendering of Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1.

 The following are recommended by the American Health Foundation's Expert Panel 
on Healthy Weight: 
</P>
<P>
 * Because most weight-related diseases are preventable, you must act now to 
reduce health problems related to excess weight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Emphasis should be on an achievable and maintainable weight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Any loss of body fat is beneficial for those who have too much. 
</P>
<P>
 * If it can be maintained, even a modest weight loss of five to 10 pounds is 
beneficial for those who are overweight. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you can't lose weight, maintain your current weight. Success is linked to 
ameliorating health risks, so efforts to avoid weight gain are worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you are at or below the target weight, maintain it. If your weight 
increases by more than five to seven pounds, do something before it becomes a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * To achieve weight loss and stabilize weight, adopt a healthy low-fat and 
high-fiber diet with no excess calories, exercise regularly and decrease 
sedentary behavior. LESLIE KNOWLTON

AT 22, AN ACTRESS WHO ALREADY HAS STRENGTH OF CHARACTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE BERGMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Somewhere on the set of "Demon Knight" someone is tinkling a piano. Jada 
Pinkett pauses between sentences and closes her eyes, reminded of her 
grandmother. "She used to play," Pinkett softly explains as she cocks her head 
to one side, soaking in the melody. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkett's reverie -- while not completely out of character -- is unusual only 
because it may be one of the few chances the 22-year-old actress has found to 
just be still. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had a vacation in four years," she says later from her trailer, 
which is strewn with Japanese comic books. "I barely even have time to talk 
with my own mother!" Not that Pinkett's complaining, but she has been busy, 
sustaining a steady pace because, she says, "This is the time to put in the 
hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Since first becoming known in 1991 when she joined the cast of NBC's "A 
Different World," Pinkett appeared in the Hughes brothers' "Menace II Society" 
as a young, single mother and in Matty Rich's "Inkwell" as the elusive love 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 She has spent the rest of her time filming the recently released "Jason's 
Lyric"; the upcoming "Low Down Dirty Shame," directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans, 
due Nov. 23 (she plays a partner to Wayans' private investigator), and "Demon 
Knight," a horror film directed by Ernest Dickerson, which has a tentative 
release date of Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Jason's Lyric," Pinkett plays Lyric, a woman who literally brings music to 
the life of Jason (Allen Payne). 
</P>
<P>
 "Lyric was a fun character for me because I got to touch on the strength of 
her femininity," she says. "So many young women these days take on male 
characteristics as a defense mechanism. Within Lyric I was able to search and 
find my strength as a woman. She's very healing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason's Lyric" director Doug McHenry initially didn't cast Pinkett as Lyric 
-- although she was a finalist -- because not only did he want to cast an 
African American woman with a darker complexion, he was unsure if he'd be able 
to elicit steamy romance between Payne and Pinkett because off-screen the two 
were "already like brother and sister." 
</P>
<P>
 So McHenry cast another actress, but within a week of shooting changed his 
mind and hired Pinkett.  
</P>
<P>
 McHenry remembers that on the first day he took her to This Is It (an actual 
soul food restaurant in Houston in which Lyric waits tables in the film) where 
he had her serving food along with the waitresses so "she'd know what it was 
like to work 12- to 14-hour shifts and then go home on the bus with aching 
feet," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult role," McHenry says of Lyric. "She's not a ghetto queen or a 
girl from the 'hood with baggy pants. In most movies you either get the 
pristine type, where there's nothing wrong with them, or you get the girl who 
can curse and drink with the best of them. You never get an in-between." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Pinkett the "finest actress of her generation," McHenry adds, "I don't 
think people understand yet the range Jada has." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with her hair shorn close and bleached (a la Wesley Snipes in 
"Demolition Man") for her role in "Demon Knight" as a troubled young woman 
confronting her personal torments, Pinkett reflects upon a quality common to 
all her characters: inner strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always tell people that it's not about attitude," she says mimicking the 
posture of a hip-hop girl looking for a fight. "The black women in my family, 
their strength comes from here !" Pinkett continues, slapping her hand to her 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
 For as long as she can remember, Pinkett has wanted to be a performer. "I took 
piano, tap and ballet," she says, "and I would construct these performances for 
my family at Christmas and Thanksgiving. At every single family get-together, 
I'd round up my cousins and give some major performance! It was a tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkett credits her grandmother, who died when Pinkett was 14, with 
encouraging her talents and enrolling her in classes. "Anything I wanted to 
do," she says, "and my grandmother would tell me that I was the best, even if I 
wasn't."  
</P>
<P>
 Named Jada after her mother's favorite soap-opera actress, Pinkett grew up as 
an only child in Baltimore. Although raised by her mother, a head nurse at a 
clinic in Baltimore's inner city, Pinkett remained close to her father, who now 
runs a construction company. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkett concentrated on dance and choreography at the Baltimore School of the 
Arts and, after graduating, became a theater major at North Carolina School of 
the Arts. A few odd jobs, a chance meeting with Keenan Ivory Wayans and some 
random bit parts later, and Pinkett found herself auditioning for "A Different 
World." She caught the eye of director Debbie Allen, who cast her as Lena 
James, a regular character with both street and book smarts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us do this," Pinkett says, "because we're artists, and some of us do 
this because they want to be famous. I'm not in this game to become famous 
because there's really nothing else I could do. I'll always be in this business 
because I can't imagine doing anything else."

 Miramax Films' "Pulp Fiction" came in first place at the box office over the 
weekend in a controversial head-to-head race against "The Specialist," the 
Warner Bros. action film starring Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone. The 
heated contest between powerhouse studio Warner Bros. and Disney-owned Miramax 
intensified this weekend when Miramax officials suddenly revised their 
estimated box-office take from $8.6 million to $9.3 million, claiming it had 
undercounted the number of screens on which the film was playing.Warners had 
also initially upped its estimate from $8.9 million to $9.3 million, but on 
Monday officially reported a figure of about $9 million. 04,35,18,10,10 Weekend

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: WILL JAPANESE BEND TO LEW AND SID? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Japan, where pride is everything, how much do you sacrifice for the sake of 
Lew R. Wasserman and Sidney J. Sheinberg? That's the cosmic question 
confronting Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. this week as it decides whether 
to bend to the demands of the veteran MCA Inc. executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman and Sheinberg appear to have stunned the conservative Japanese 
manufacturing giant by threatening to walk away from MCA unless they can 
negotiate a deal to buy back control or wield more strategic authority. Joining 
them in the moving van would be director Steven Spielberg and record mogul 
David Geffen -- arguably two of MCA's biggest assets. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a serious incentive for any company to compromise, as the two sides 
begin discussions across a bargaining table today. But sources warn that the 
MCA duo's brinkmanship could still backfire, given the 81-year-old Wasserman's 
advancing age and MCA's mixed record of success since Matsushita bought it for 
$6.59 billion four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Matsushita may feel that it's better to save face than to cave in to an aging 
and angry management team," said one knowledgeable source. "They may also feel 
they can succeed without them." 
</P>
<P>
 Matsushita's relations with MCA have been periodically strained since the firm 
landed in Hollywood in 1990, when Japan's fervor for entertainment investments 
was at its peak. The early awkwardness of melding disparate corporate cultures 
has given way to more substantive problems, such as Matsushita's repeated 
resistance to MCA growing through major acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated hopes for buying Virgin Records, a disagreement over theme parks 
and, more recently, acquiring a stake in NBC added to a tense situation between 
MCA point man Sheinberg and the home office in Osaka. "The Japanese don't like 
Sid," one source said flatly. "They find him irritating." 
</P>
<P>
 Says another source, in Sheinberg's defense: "Lew and Sid made the deal with 
Matsushita because it was known as a passive investor. By and large (Matsushita 
has) fulfilled that. But they also thought Matsushita would use its capital 
resources to help MCA compete against global companies like Time Warner. That 
has been the sore point . . . and what has driven them crazy. Every year money 
has flown from Universal City to Osaka -- not the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 MCA was a rare bright spot on Matsushita's ledger last year. It posted a 14% 
gain in revenue, to $4.1 billion, and operating margins of 7.5% at a time when 
Matsushita's core manufacturing business was in decline. Morgan Stanley in New 
York reported in September that MCA's revenue will be slightly higher -- about 
$4.3 billion -- for fiscal 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many industry competitors see MCA as an average performer at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Its Universal Pictures unit ranks fourth among the seven major studios in 
market share so far this year, with 13.8%. It produced last summer's smash "The 
Flintstones" and has had modest success with two recent movies, "Timecop" and 
"The River Wild." "Junior," the holiday comedy starring Arnold Schwarzenegger 
and Danny DeVito, has strong expectations. That's blunted some of the criticism 
leveled its way last year, when the studio went through a dry spell. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal finished 1993 with roughly $670 million in revenue. But analysts 
point out that close to half that came from Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" and 
"Schindler's List." When Spielberg is removed from the equation, MCA drops from 
third to sixth in 1993 market share. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA Music is another mixed bag. The company is the industry powerhouse in 
country and youth-oriented rhythm and blues, but it still suffers from a 
reputation as a rock graveyard, apart from the acts signed to its independently 
managed Geffen Records subsidiary. It placed last among the six major 
distributors for domestic market share last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the television arena, MCA ranks a strong second this fall among suppliers 
of prime-time network TV series. Its shows include "Coach," "seaQuest" and 
"Northern Exposure." Universal is weak, however, in the lucrative first-run 
syndication market of talk shows and game shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Theme parks are another problem area for MCA and its competitors. Analyst 
Jeffrey Logsdon of Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles estimates that revenue from its 
parks in Universal City and Orlando is down 5% to 10% this year -- because of a 
soft international travel market and other changes. Locally, Universal Studios 
attendance was hurt by the January earthquake. One bright spot: the City Walk 
complex of restaurants and shops adjacent to Universal Studios Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say it's too early to judge the company's new media initiatives. MCA 
is an investor in 3DO, the creator of an advanced video game system that has 
yet to make its mark. Its Universal Interactive Studios also has an equity 
stake in Interplay, a respected video game firm based in Irvine, and MCA 
recently released a game based on "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 On a management basis, people close to the company say Wasserman and Sheinberg 
still run MCA much the same as always. The dour-looking Sheinberg, at 59, has 
most of the day-to-day responsibility for the company, which operates with a 
small group of senior executives. Sources say Sheinberg's main frustration is 
having his hands tied strategically. "Sid sees his legacy in building MCA, but 
they won't give him those tools," says one colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 The silver-maned Wasserman still spends full days on the job, and can usually 
be found holding court at his corner table at the MCA commissary in Universal 
City. He continues to be a force in Motion Picture Assn. of America activities 
and routinely calls to check on the company's film grosses at 5:30 a.m. Besides 
all that, he remains active in national political fund raising, hosting as many 
as two events each month at his Beverly Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the sole exception of the fact that Lew is five years older and probably 
walks 5% slower, I dare you to find any 81-year-old keeping that pace," said 
one MCA source close to Wasserman. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet sources say Wasserman's age could become a factor in the contract 
negotiations, since Matsushita may be willing to bend only so far for an 
executive 16 years past traditional retirement age. For that reason, many 
people are focusing on Sheinberg. But executives close to the company say it's 
a given that if Wasserman leaves, Sheinberg -- his loyal lieutenant for 30 
years -- would leave with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Alienating Spielberg, who is in the midst of forming a company with Geffen and 
former Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, is something the 
Japanese take more seriously. But sources say Matsushita won't necessarily roll 
over for him, either. They point out that Spielberg must still fulfill several 
commitments to the studio, including a "Jurassic Park" sequel. In addition, 
they say he would probably depart within a few years anyway -- when the company 
he's starting with Katzenberg and Geffen forms its own distribution and 
marketing system. 
</P>
<P>
 All the talk of possible change has left many executives in the MCA complex 
unsettled and angry, with some complaining that they can't believe they're 
confronting an uncertain future again only four years after the company's sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The most sensible solution in many people minds is a compromise that would 
keep Wasserman and Sheinberg on board at least a couple more years, since 
Wasserman and Sheinberg aren't really looking to walk away from their lives' 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA has never had a clear succession plan. And with Hollywood's infamously 
thin executive ranks, replacing Wasserman and Sheinberg would be a daunting 
task. But skeptical sources warn that it should not be precluded, even though 
everyone would prefer to reach an accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Hollywood," said one. "Crazier things happen here all the time."

 When MCA's corporate jet lifts off today, the ambitions of MCA President 
Sidney J. Sheinberg will take flight as well. He and MCA Chairman Lew R. 
Wasserman are traveling to meet with senior executives from Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co. to discuss the strained relations between the Japanese parent 
and its frustrated Hollywood subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, Sheinberg is not seeking a "High Noon" showdown, but this 
meeting and others to follow will help determine whether the 59-year-old 
executive stays with MCA after his contract expires next year. For Sheinberg 
and the 81-year-old Wasserman, the emotional stakes are high because they are 
the only executives -- other than the late MCA founder Jules Stein -- to have 
headed MCA in its 70-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Osaka, Japan-based Matsushita called for the meeting in the wake of MCA's 
distress several weeks ago when it was blocked from pursuing a bid to acquire a 
stake in a broadcast network (reportedly NBC), several sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the get-together became public knowledge only when two of MCA's most 
talented associates -- filmmaker Steven Spielberg and music and film mogul 
David Geffen -- announced last week that they intend to launch a new studio 
with former Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg. Reports swirled 
that the three businessmen might back a bid for MCA if Wasserman and Sheinberg 
proposed a buyback of all or part of the company they sold in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 News reports of the ongoing talks and conjecture about a possible buyback deal 
are said to have angered executives at Matsushita, who are sensitive to public 
criticism. One source said Sheinberg was also angry about the leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the barrage of publicity, MCA officials were taking pains Monday to 
clamp some secrecy on today's meeting, now at an undisclosed spot after earlier 
reports had it taking place in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheinberg tried to downplay the drama of the upcoming session, saying: "I 
really have no vendetta against this company or many of its people, which is 
not to say relations are not strained between certain people. Hopefully these 
discussions will yield opportunities to enhance the value of their assets." 
</P>
<P>
 MCA insiders -- including Sheinberg -- refused Monday to discuss any hope 
Sheinberg and Wasserman might harbor of buying back a stake in MCA. Pundits, 
meanwhile, expressed the opinion that Geffen, Spielberg and Katzenberg will 
seek a controlling stake if they bid for an existing studio -- and MCA turns 
out to be too expensive for even their bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Kassan, an entertainment analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimated MCA is 
worth between $8 billion and $8.5 billion; others think it could fetch even 
more, given that Paramount Communications sold for $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts are doubtful that Matsushita will consider selling any 
portion of the entertainment company. "The Japanese don't sell things," said 
Lee S. Isgur, a San Francisco-based analyst with Jefferies & Co. "I think the 
Japanese got involved in this because they believe wealth and power are 
measured by content." 
</P>
<P>
 The gush of publicity, however, may hurt MCA's negotiations. "This is not the 
way to conduct business in New York or Japan," one top entertainment company 
executive said reprovingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, after months of suspense, some MCA insiders are thrilled that Sheinberg 
and Wasserman seem prepared to go to the mat for the company. "The way it's set 
up now is not working," said one executive who has despaired of Matsushita's 
conservative ways and preoccupation with other problems in its consumer 
electronics business. Troubled Talks 
</P>
<P>
 MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman and President Sidney J. Sheinberg are in 
troubled contract negotiations with their parent company, Matsushita. Though 
MCA's Universal Studios ranks reasonably well in film market share, 
entertainment is a small part of Matsushita's revenue. The company's record 
division (UNI), however, is lagging. Steven Spielberg, a hit maker for 
Universal, is key to negotiations.

GENSIA STOCK FALLS BY HALF ON FAILURE OF FLAGSHIP DRUG; BIOTECHNOLOGY: 
HOPED-FOR HEART MEDICATION BREAKTHROUGH FIZZLES, BUT THE COMPANY IS EXPECTED TO 
SURVIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gensia Inc., a San Diego company that had been considered one of the most 
promising biotechnology firms in the country, suffered a stunning setback 
Monday when its flagship heart drug failed to pass muster in human clinical 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Gensia's stock plummeted 51% -- falling $5.31 to $5.06 -- on the news that the 
drug, Protara, failed to prove significantly more effective than a placebo in 
reducing heart attacks and other cardiovascular complications in patients 
undergoing coronary bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Protara had been considered a breakthrough drug, with analysts forecasting 
worldwide sales of up to several hundred million dollars over the next several 
years if the drug could gain U.S. market approval. But an outside panel 
monitoring clinical tests on 2,700 patients concluded that the drug did not 
produce a statistically significant reduction in heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The results "certainly took away this potential blockbuster drug," said David 
F. Hale, Gensia's chairman and chief executive. Hale said he still thinks 
Protara can be an important drug, but the company will suspend clinical trials 
pending a closer look at the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe we have shown the drug has a therapeutic action," Hale said. "We 
just haven't been able to demonstrate the statistical significance in this 
study." 
</P>
<P>
 Gensia wasn't the only biotechnology company to take a beating Monday on 
disappointing test results. Shares of Kirkland, Wash.-based Procyte plunged 68% 
-- dropping $6.06 to $2.81 -- after the firm announced that an ulcer drug 
flopped in clinical tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The test results are among a series of disappointments in biotechnology this 
year when drugs have failed to live up to expectations. Analysts said the 
Gensia and Procyte cases illustrate once again the unpredictability of new drug 
development and the risk of investing in young biotech firms. 
</P>
<P>
 However, although the Protara results are a big setback, analysts said Gensia 
should survive because it has other successful products on the market and some 
promising drugs in development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company will survive, but it's certainly a setback," said Jim McCamant, 
editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley. "This was the 
biggest potential product in their pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Schneider, a general partner at Domain Associates, a Costa Mesa 
biotech investment firm that was an early backer of Gensia, said he was 
surprised by the results but still likes Gensia's chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
 Gensia "is a very well-balanced and well-managed company," he said. "There is 
no question this is a body blow, but it's not a one-product company." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said the company plans to analyze the test data further before deciding 
on the future of Protara for use in coronary bypass surgery or non-cardiac 
surgery. Based on the trial results, the company said it will cancel a separate 
clinical trial to examine Protara's effectiveness in preventing medical 
complications in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said one option for Gensia would be to find a corporate partner to 
finance additional clinical trials of Protara in exchange for a share of any 
future revenue. Such trials typically cost in excess of $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the Protara results, Gensia said it will "re-examine its spending 
levels and the allocation of resources." That will probably include some staff 
cuts at the 525-employee company, but Hale said "we don't see a major 
downsizing at Gensia." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said the company had $45 million in cash as of Sept. 30 and expects a 
$20-million investment from Boehringer Mannheim Pharmaceuticals Corp. for a 
recent deal to jointly develop and market a cardiovascular drug-delivery 
system.

DIAL C FOR LOCAL COMPETITION IN PHONE MARKET; COMMUNICATIONS: CONSUMER CHOICE 
IS ON THE HORIZON AS STATE REGULATORS NATIONWIDE ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO 
ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the recent failure of federal legislation aimed at spurring 
competition in the telecommunications industry, local telephone service -- the 
last stronghold of traditional telephone monopolies -- is finally being 
subjected to the rigors of the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 From New York to California, state regulators are taking the lead in 
eliminating the barriers that have insulated local telephone providers from 
competition. Although the process is proceeding slowly, millions of Americans 
will probably be able to choose among competing local phone companies within 
the next several years, with the local cable television company emerging as the 
primary alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the favorable regulatory climate in Illinois, New York-based Teleport 
Communications Group said last week that it plans to team with its part owner, 
cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., and Motorola Inc. to offer local phone 
service early next year in suburban Chicago. The consortium will compete with 
the regional Bell telephone company Ameritech Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Teleport announcement came only days after the nation's No. 2 
long-distance carrier, MCI Communications Corp., said it plans to compete 
against several Baby Bells by building local networks in five states. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, New York regulators approved a groundbreaking plan that would 
enable about 500,000 consumers in Rochester to enjoy full local telephone 
competition between Rochester Telephone Corp. and a unit of entertainment giant 
Time Warner Inc. And in Montgomery County, Md., SBC Communications Inc., 
formerly Southwestern Bell Corp., is seeking permission to invade the territory 
of rival Bell Atlantic and compete head to head for its telephone customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is shifting their focus to the states . . . " said Bradley 
Stillman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, a 
Washington-based nonprofit group. "We did not need federal legislation in 1994 
to build (an information) superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 State regulators say they have been able to make headway in part because, 
unlike Congress, they have not had to confront the divisive issue of how to 
allow the regional Bells into the interstate long-distance business, said Lisa 
Rosenblum, vice chairwoman of the New York State Public Service Commission. In 
23 states -- California is not among them -- some form of local service 
competition is already allowed, according to the Alexandria, Va.-based State 
Telephone Regulation Report. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, deregulation on the state level -- and especially the limited local 
service competition that now exists -- has benefited mostly big business. But 
some would-be local access providers such as Teleport and MCI are beginning to 
target the mass consumer market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teleport will provide local telephone service wherever there is a strong 
market demand for a choice, provided that it is technically feasible, 
economically viable and has been authorized by state regulators," said Robert 
Annunziata, president of the New York-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the uneven pace of change at the state level has spurred complaints 
among customers, who have grown accustomed to falling prices and a wide choice 
of carriers for long-distance calling but are still forced to deal with 
expensive monopoly providers for their local service. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommuters such as PC magazine columnist John C. Dvorak have complained 
that Baby Bells, such as US West, are letting their "phone business stagnate" 
by not moving fast enough to modernize their networks for home computer use. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, many consumer groups complain that phone rates are too high. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of concern about local rates and services even as people have 
become less concerned about long-distance, because there is more competition" 
in that area, said Michael Hefer, a senior staff member of Consumer Action, a 
San Francisco-based nonprofit group active in utility issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, these problems will go away as local phone competition heats up, 
with customers enjoying lower prices and better service. In practice, though, 
some worry that competition will in effect be limited to the business market. 
And that prospect angers the telephone companies, who accuse their rivals of 
cream-skimming. 
</P>
<P>
 "My companies know that competition is coming," said Kathy Woods, director of 
regulatory relations for the U.S. Telephone Assn. in Washington. "But they want 
parity and fairness. As phone companies, we have had an obligation to provide 
universal telephone service; we can't pick and choose." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, phone companies have proven more willing to compromise at the 
state level than on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Bickering between long-distance carriers and the Baby Bells last month caused 
U.S. Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) to pull the plug on the landmark federal 
legislation.  
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the measure, which would have allowed long-distance carriers, 
cable operators and local phone companies into one another's markets, triggered 
widespread criticism of Bell company lobbying tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Telecommunications reform was not only about responsible associations seeking 
compromise on important points . . . " Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the Federal 
Communications Commission, told the United States Telephone Assn. in a speech 
last week. "It was and it still is about huge companies in different industries 
retaining fleets of lawyers and armadas of lobbyists that battle Congress every 
hour of the day for months on end."

IT'S OFFICIAL: GE SELLING KIDDER TO PAINEWEBBER; SECURITIES: THE DEAL FOR $670 
MILLION IN STOCK WOULD FREE THE CONGLOMERATE FROM WHAT HAS BEEN A FINANCIAL 
QUAGMIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 General Electric Co., ridding itself of a troublesome and embarrassing 
division, formally agreed Monday to sell Kidder, Peabody & Co. to rival 
brokerage house PaineWebber Group for stock valued at $670 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, which had been rumored for days, GE would receive 
PaineWebber common and preferred stock that would would give the company a 25% 
stake in PaineWebber. GE would also get one seat on PaineWebber's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 While the deal would free GE of a financial quagmire, it would lift 
PaineWebber a notch in the ranks of Wall Street's giants, both in the retail 
and investment banking areas. It could also mean massive layoffs at Kidder. 
</P>
<P>
 By acquiring Kidder's 1,150 brokers in 50 offices, PaineWebber would have a 
total of 6,700 brokers, making it the nation's fourth-largest investment firm 
by that yardstick. It's currently fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidder's brokers are known for tending mainly to wealthy investors, and the 
amount of customer assets under PaineWebber's management would rise by a third, 
to more than $180 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidder should also give PaineWebber a boost in investment banking, 
particularly in underwriting securities. For instance, Kidder was sixth among 
the Top 10 underwriters of U.S. debt through the first nine months of this 
year, and PaineWebber was absent from the list, according to the research firm 
Securities Data Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But in terms of capital, PaineWebber would stay in eighth place despite the 
Kidder deal and so remain a second-tier player behind the likes of Merrill 
Lynch & Co. and Salomon Bros. Capital is a key measure of the financial 
wherewithal a Wall Street firm has for growth and expansion, particularly in 
the area of investment banking. 
</P>
<P>
 As for 129-year-old Kidder Peabody itself, the deal is likely to mean pink 
slips for hundreds of the firm's 5,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber declined to comment on potential cutbacks and office closures, 
saying those issues -- along with the future of the Kidder name -- are under 
review. But as part of its deal, GE agreed to pay severance costs for Kidder 
employees who are dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Major layoffs are "likely because there's fairly large numbers of duplication 
in terms of the back-office" jobs that support the firms' brokers and traders, 
said Geoff Bobroff, a financial services consultant in East Greenwich, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 As for GE, shedding Kidder would cut loose a business that has been extremely 
costly and a public relations fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfield, Conn.-based GE bought Kidder for $600 million in 1986, but it has 
pumped an additional $800 million into the firm since then. Kidder has suffered 
major losses in such areas as mortgage bond trading, and last spring it was 
shaken by allegations that its star government bond trader, Joseph Jett, had 
concocted $350 million in phony profits in a scheme to hide trading losses. 
Jett denies the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 GE's decision to shed Kidder illustrates once again how even well-managed 
companies often stumble in managing a Wall Street brokerage whose fortunes are 
tied to the capricious financial markets. GE is otherwise an enormously 
profitable conglomerate, with interests in everything from appliances to jet 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kidder mess also reinforces the failure of the "financial supermarket" 
experiment of the 1980s, when big, diversified companies gobbled up brokerage 
houses in hope of giving consumers "one-stop shopping" for their financial 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, Roebuck & Co.'s purchase of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and American 
Express Co.'s ownership of Shearson Lehman Bros. are two other examples. In 
both cases, the brokerage firms were later divested. 
</P>
<P>
 GE's struggle with Kidder was even more pointed, though, because a third of 
GE's revenue and operating earnings -- which totaled $60.6 billion and $7.8 
billion, respectively, last year -- come from its GE Capital Services unit, an 
oft-praised financial powerhouse that is heavily involved in corporate lending 
and leasing services. 
</P>
<P>
 In selling Kidder, however, GE said it expects to record a pretax charge 
totaling about $500 million, probably in this quarter, GE spokeswoman Joyce 
Hergenhan said. About $300 million of that sum reflects a non-cash accounting 
entry, called good will, that stems from GE's purchase of Kidder and now must 
be charged against earnings because of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining $200 million reflects GE's agreement to pay for actually 
shutting down Kidder, including severance costs related to the expected 
layoffs, and any future legal costs stemming from Kidder's bond trading 
scandal, Hergenhan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of GE's overall size, however, the charge is expected to have a 
negligible impact on the company's financial health, the credit-rating firm 
Standard & Poor's Corp. said Monday in affirming its AAA rating on GE's debt. 
</P>
<P>
 * Q&A: What to do when your broker is sold. D3 What the Deal Means 
</P>
<P>
 * For PaineWebber: Acquires 1,150 Kidder brokers, including many that serve 
wealthy investors, and $50.5 billion in Kidder customer accounts. Incurs no 
liability in the Kidder bond-trading scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 * For General Electric: Rids itself of a troublesome operation. Faces an 
approximate $500-million charge related to divestiture. Retains a 25% stake in 
PaineWebber. 
</P>
<P>
 * For Kidder: Possible layoff of hundreds of employees. The 129-year-old 
Kidder name could vanish from Wall Street.

INDEPENDENT DRUGSTORES TAKE PRICE-FIXING CASE TO COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drugstore owners fired the latest volley in an ongoing battle with 
pharmaceutical companies Monday by filing price-fixing lawsuits in 15 states. 
</P>
<P>
 The Georgia Pharmacy Assn., which is leading the nationwide effort by smaller 
independent drugstores, said 1,349 suits were filed in federal courts.The 
litigation follows about 400 suits filed in January and a class-action suit 
filed by major drugstore chains last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The suits contend that leading drug makers are charging independent drugstores 
and chains inordinately higher prices than those paid by hospitals, health 
maintenance organizations and mail-order sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Price discrimination by pharmaceutical manufacturers forces patients of 
community pharmacies . . . to pay the highest possible price for their 
medications," said Larry Braden, an Atlanta pharmacy owner and executive vice 
president of the Georgia group.  
</P>
<P>
 The 27 drug makers named as defendants include such major firms as Pfizer 
Inc., Glaxo Holdings, Ciba-Geigy Corp., SmithKline Beecham, Merck & Co., Upjohn 
Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Also named in the suit are three mail-order 
drug suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 The suits were filed in Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, 
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, 
South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug manufacturers have denied fixing prices. "Discounting is a way of life in 
America," said Steve Berchem, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and 
Manufacturers of America.

EARNINGS: APPLE SHARPLY TOPS ANALYST PROJECTIONS WITH 4TH-QUARTER FIGURES

 Citing reduced costs and record revenue generated by new products, Apple 
Computer Inc. on Monday posted fiscal fourth-quarter net income more than 42 
times greater than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple said it earned $114.7 million in its fiscal fourth quarter, outdoing 
analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's profit for the quarter ended Sept. 30 amounted to 95 cents per 
share, sharply above the 65-cent consensus estimate on Wall Street. Last week, 
Apple said it expected to beat the Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Apple earned a meager $2.7 million, or 2 cents per share, as it 
struggled with a high cost structure and dwindling demand for its core 
Macintosh computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, up from $2.1 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For the year, Apple earned $310.2 million, or $2.61 a share, compared to $86.6

closed $1.375 lower at $39.75 on the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel Corp. reported that third-quarter profit rose 13%, pushed by 
continuing strong demand for personal computers and growing acceptance of the 
company's flagship Pentium microprocessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel, the world's biggest maker of computer chips, earned $659 million, or 
$1.52 a share, for the three months ended Oct. 1. Net income for the same

MEXICO OPENS ITS FINANCIAL SYSTEM TO FOREIGN COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexico opened its financial system to the world Monday when Finance Minister 
Pedro Aspe announced that 52 foreign financial institutions will be allowed to 
operate in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The institutions include 18 banks, 16 brokerage firms, 12 insurance companies, 
five holding companies and one leasing company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspe said the firms will bring $1.21 billion in direct investment to Mexico in 
the first half of 1995, when they are expected to be in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the financial system came as part of the economic reforms of 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and accords reached under the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspe said the new banks will bring added capital and competition, lower the 
cost of credit and stimulate economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The government received 102 applications from foreign firms seeking Mexican 
operations, which historically have not been allowed, except for Citibank, 
which has had limited banking operations here since 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of new banks is heavily weighted with U.S. institutions, including 
Citibank, which will also have a brokerage, holding company and the lone 
leasing company; J.P. Morgan, Republic National Bank of New York, NationsBank, 
Chemical Bank, Bank of America, Chase Manhattan, Bank of Boston, First Chicago 
and American Express. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those granted licenses for brokerage firms were Goldman Sachs, Bear 
Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Bros., J.P. Morgan, Bankers Trust, Deutsche 
Bank, Morgan Stanley, Swiss Bank, Indosuez, James Capel and Baring Securities, 
Aspe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico now has 37 banks, all of them Mexican-owned except for Citibank.

GOVERNMENT TAKES AIM AT GM PICKUPS; AUTOS: IT ACCUSES COMPANY OF KNOWINGLY 
PRODUCING TRUCKS PRONE TO FIRES IN CRASHES. COMPANY VOWS COURT FIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WARREN BROWN, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Transportation Secretary Federico Pena on Monday accused General Motors Corp. 
of knowingly producing millions of defective pickup trucks that can explode and 
burn in side-impact crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that knowledge, GM chose for at least 15 years not to alter the design 
of the trucks, Pena said. "Approximately 150 people have died as a result of 
side-impact fires in these trucks, in crashes that were otherwise survivable," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena voiced his accusations in announcing that his department has made an 
initial finding that a safety defect exists in GM C-K trucks with fuel tanks 
mounted outside steel rails that support the cargo bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucks were manufactured for the 1973 through 1987 model years and include 
the GMC Sierra and Chevrolet C-K 1500 and 2500 series. 
</P>
<P>
 GM officials called Pena's claims "outrageous and wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 "These trucks are recognized even by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration to have fully met the applicable safety standards for fuel 
system integrity in collision," said GM Vice President Bruce G. MacDonald, the 
company's chief spokesman. "They outperform many newer vehicles in terms of 
both fuel system crashworthiness and occupant protection." 
</P>
<P>
 About 9 million GM trucks were manufactured with the sidesaddle tanks. How 
many of the full-size vehicles remain on the road is unclear: The government 
says 4.5 million, while GM puts the figure at 6.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucks were featured in a 1992 segment of the "Dateline NBC" TV show in 
which the news crew, officials confirmed, had placed tiny rocket engines in a 
truck to assure that it exploded during a filmed crash. The network later 
apologized for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's initial finding of defect Monday could lead to a final 
determination that a safety problem exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Should that be made, the Transportation Department and the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration, working through the Justice Department, could 
seek a court-ordered recall of the affected vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced recalls are rare, costly and time-consuming. The government has gone to 
court against auto makers and their suppliers only eight times since the 
founding of the NHTSA in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 The government won seven of those cases. But it suffered a major defeat in the 
early 1980s when it attempted to force GM to call back millions of its 
Chevrolet Citation, Oldsmobile Omega, Buick Skylark and Pontiac Phoenix cars to 
repair allegedly defective brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 GM officials said Monday that they would go to court again to defend the 
reputation of the C-K pickups. 
</P>
<P>
 A GM official who asked not to be identified accused Pena of trying to hold 
the company to a double standard. "We meet or exceed all existing federal 
standards for fuel system integrity, yet he says we are defective," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena conceded that the GM trucks meet existing federal standards. But he said 
federal auto safety laws place auto makers "under two broad mandates: first, to 
meet applicable safety standards in producing vehicles, and second, to produce 
vehicles that operate safely in real-world conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Public hearings on the department's initial findings are scheduled to begin 
Dec. 6.

KARCHER TO PITCH AGAIN FOR CARL'S JR.; FAST FOOD: FOUNDER AND FORMER CHAIRMAN 
WILL RETURN TO ROLE IN TV ADS AS PART OF A REVAMPED MARKETING EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hamburger magnate Carl N. Karcher, 78, forced out last year as chairman of the 
company he founded more than half a century ago, will soon return to his 
well-known role as television pitchman for the Carl's Jr. chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher's return as spokesman is part of a revamped marketing program that 
will emphasize quality rather than low prices at the ailing Anaheim-based 
burger chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also announced Monday that Bay Area franchisee Tom Thompson has 
been named to the new post of chief operating officer of the Carl's Jr. chain. 
Thompson will report to Donald E. Doyle, president and chief executive of CKE 
Restaurants, parent of Carl's Jr. and Boston Pacific Inc., operator of the 
Boston Chicken chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher's return to commercials is part of the fast-food chain's decision to 
reverse its strategy and again emphasize food quality rather than attempting to 
cast itself as a low-priced leader, CKE Restaurants Chairman William P. Foley 
II said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carl's Jr. chain has lost market share in recent years to large national 
chains, including Taco Bell and McDonald's, that successfully marketed 
themselves as value leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "In theory, the thought was that you fixed (falling revenue) by lowering the 
prices, attracting more customers and driving store sales up," Foley said. "But 
we basically started to charge our existing customers less, and we weren't 
attracting enough new customers to make store sales go up." 
</P>
<P>
 The return to TV is sweet news for Karcher, who was forced out as chairman of 
the Carl's Jr. chain last October during a bitter boardroom battle over 
corporate strategy. Foley, an Orange County businessman who last December took 
a controlling interest in CKE Restaurants, subsequently invited Karcher to 
return as chairman emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy about coming back as the TV personality for Carl's Jr.."

<P>
 The dollar plunged to two-year lows against key European currencies Monday as 
the election victory of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right coalition 
prompted a surge of funds into the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock and bond markets finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. currency also dipped to a four-week low against the Japanese yen. 
Analysts said the German election served as the catalyst for a venting of 
disenchantment with the dollar and U.S. assets. 
</P>
<P>
 News that Kohl's pro-business Christian Democrats edged out left-of-center 
challengers in Sunday's elections sent the mark sharply higher in early Tokyo 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollar ended quite weak in New York on Friday, and the Asian market was 
just waiting for the German results," said Belal Khan, senior dealer for the 
Bank of Tokyo in New York. "It gave a green light to sell dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Christian Democrat-led coalition's narrow margin of victory left it 
with just a slight majority in Parliament. Kohl is likely to have trouble 
advancing his conservative economic policies. "The election results weren't 
that encouraging," Khan said. "The market was clearly looking for an excuse to 
buy marks."  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Glowacki, senior currency dealer at NBD Bank in Detroit, noted that 
technical trading and speculation added to the dollar's weakness as the 
currency crashed toward two-year lows against the mark, Swiss franc and British 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
 "When those targets get close, the market tends to go after them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4990 marks -- the lowest 
level since October, 1992 -- down from 1.5195 on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 The British pound hit $1.6100 in New York, up from $1.5940. The dollar was 
also changing hands in New York at 97.65 yen, down from 98.20 and near a 
postwar low. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. stocks, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.46 points to 
3,923.93. But declining issues edged advancers by about 11 to 10 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Broader indexes were mostly lower. Trading was moderate, 
with about 238 million shares changing hands on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are losing conviction about the sustainability of the upward momentum 
for the market," said Rao Chalasani, chief strategist at Kemper Securities 
Group in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 A new-home sales report is due later in the week, and most major blue-chip 
companies report earnings this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's main 30-year bond fell to 7.82% from 7.83% on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Eastman Kodak fell 1 3/8 to 48 1/8. The camera and photo equipment firm said 
in an internal memo that it will freeze hiring and reduce expenditures because 
profits are under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 General Electric closed unchanged at 50 3/8 on the Big Board. The company 
agreed to sell its troubled Kidder Peabody brokerage subsidiary to PaineWebber 
for $670 million. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Nasdaq, California Micro Devices was down 6 3/8 to 7 1/2 in active 
trading. The company said it launched an investigation into accounting 
irregularities that could result in restated earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of drug maker Gensia fell 5 1/4 to 5 1/2 after the company's heart 
attack drug failed human tests. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Amex, Greyhound Lines shares rose 1/4 to 2 1/2 after the bus company 
said it was negotiating new agreements with creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Overseas markets closed mixed. In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share average 
finished down 14.85 points at 2,090.88. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average 
ended 11 points lower at 19,958.29. London's Financial Times 100-share average 
closed 13.5 points higher at 3,120.2. 
</P>
<P>
 * The December coffee contract traded in a wide range, falling early based on 
predictions of more scattered rains in afflicted areas of Brazil. But the 
market rebounded swiftly after a private weather forecaster emphasized the 
severity of the drought. 
</P>
<P>
 The forecaster, Weather Services Corp., said its data showed the current 
Brazilian drought to be substantially more severe than the 1985 drought. 
</P>
<P>
 December coffee jumped 15.50 cents to 203.85 cents a pound, rebounding from a 
session low of 179 cents.

EARNINGS: LOAN INCOME PUSHES FIRST INTERSTATE'S PROFIT UP 44% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First Interstate Bancorp said Monday that third-quarter profit from operations 
rose 44% on increased income from loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles bank said profit from operations was $216.2 million, or $2.54 
a share, up from year-earlier net income of $150.5 million, or $1.80 a share. 
In the latest quarter, a charge for consolidating operations made net income 
$130 million, or $1.49 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The figure beat the mean estimate of $2.35 a share from 16 analysts surveyed 
by Zacks Investment Research. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate's shares closed up 87.5 cents at $81.125 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge for cutting more than 3,000 jobs, or almost 11% of its work force, 
and closing redundant operations amounted to $86.2 million, or $1.05 a share, 
in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts will position First Interstate for nationwide banking and "will move 
us closer to the final step that will take First Interstate from a company of 
banks to a single banking company," said Edward Carson, chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's income from making loans and charging fees, or net interest 
income and non-interest income, improved in the third quarter from a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Net interest income rose to $601.8 million from $528.1 million, mostly because 
of a rise in net loans, to $30.3 billion from $26 billion. Non-interest income 
rose to $281 million from $239 million, partly because of gains in service 
charges on deposit accounts and fees from trust operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-interest expenses rose to $667.8 million from $507.5 million a year 
earlier. The expenses include the charge from cutting staff and closing 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The company took no provision for loan losses in the third quarter, compared 
to $21.9 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first nine months, net income fell to $522.3 million, or $6.09 a share, 
from $590.7 million, or $7.20, a year ago.

 IBM to Consolidate PC Lines: Moving to reduce consumers' confusion about its 
products and regain lost market share, the company said it will reduce the 
number of product lines to four from nine. But Richard Thoman, the senior vice 
president who heads the PC Co. division, said International Business Machines 
Corp. will not see the benefits of its new strategy and its recent 
restructuring announced in July until mid-1995. The new brand names are IBM PC, 
for business computers; IBM PC Server, for machines connected on local area 
networks; ThinkPad, for portable computers, and Aptiva, for its personal 
computers targeted at home and family users.

 Lawsuits Exchanged in Magma Takeover Bid: Locked in an increasingly 
acrimonious takeover battle, geothermal energy producers California Energy of 
Omaha and Magma Power of San Diego traded lawsuits in connection with 
California Energy's unsolicited $840-million offer to acquire Magma.California 
Energy alleged in its suit that Magma violated its fiduciary responsibilities 
to shareholders in rebuffing its offer. Magma answered with its own suit 
alleging that California Energy violated federal disclosure laws relating to 
its tender offer and its solicitation of proxies to force a special 
shareholders meeting to discuss its proposed acquisition offer. Both suits were 
filed in federal court in Reno.

 Inventories Up 1% in August: Businesses built up their stockpiles at a rapid 
pace in August despite the fastest sales in 7 1/2 years, the Commerce 
Department said. Inventories rose 1%, the fifth consecutive advance and the 
biggest since 1.2% in May, the department said.Sales rose 3% as auto dealers 
restocked after shutting down in July to retool for 1995 models. Analysts said 
the figures are fresh evidence of economic strength, increasing the chances 
that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates again next month. 
Analysts said the inventory increase will probably inflate the economic 
expansion in the third quarter to about 3%, making another boost in short-term 
interest rates by the Fed more likely when central bank policy-makers meet.

 Kraft Agrees to Sell All American Gourmet Co.: Kraft General Foods Inc. said 
it has reached agreement to sell the Orange-based subsidiary, maker of the 
popular Budget Gourmet line of frozen food, to H.J. Heinz Co.Terms were not 
disclosed. A Heinz spokesman said he was not yet aware of the plans for All 
American's Orange County headquarters, where 89 executives and other workers 
are employed. "They haven't gotten around to the organizational details," said 
Heinz spokesman D. Edward I. Smyth. The frozen foods are manufactured at plants 
in Clearfield, Utah, and Atlanta, with total employment companywide of about 
1,000.

 Roche Holding Will Cut 5,000 Jobs: The big Swiss-owned drug and chemical 
company said it will make the cuts over the next several months as it absorbs 
operations of U.S. drug maker Syntex Corp. Roche, inventor of the well-known 
tranquilizers Librium and Valium, completed its $5.3-billion buyout of Syntex, 
a pioneer in birth control pills, Aug. 31. The job cuts, amounting to about 8% 
of the combined work force, will come mostly through attrition and early 
retirements, but layoffs are also unavoidable, said Roche spokesman Gaston von 
Glutz. He declined to offer an estimate.

 Ford Recalls 1995 Contour, Mercury Mystique: The auto maker said it recalled 
the new sedans for the second time in a month and halted production of the cars 
for a week to accommodate fuel leakage repair. Ford Motor Co. said it will 
install new fuel tank assemblies in about 28,500 of the cars due to 14 reports 
of leakage from a plastic fuel tank reinforcement pipe. It said it has not 
received any reports of fires, accidents or injuries in connection with the 
problem.

Q&A: HOW KIDDER DEAL AFFECTS YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Announcing one of the biggest brokerage industry acquisitions in history, 
PaineWebber Group said Monday that it will buy Kidder Peabody & Co. in a stock 
swap worth roughly $670 million. The transaction will turn PaineWebber into the 
nation's fourth-largest brokerage, but many of the combined company's employees 
-- and customers -- will be displaced as PaineWebber shutters branches and 
jettisons workers. 
</P>
<P>
 What will the merger mean to retail customers of both firms? Here's a look. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Will my broker be laid off? 
</P>
<P>
 A. That's unlikely, says Joseph Grano, president of retail sales and marketing 
at PaineWebber. The purpose of the merger is to give PaineWebber a better 
position in the retail market, so the firm plans to concentrate layoffs in 
back-office services such as accounting and data processing rather than in 
retail services. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What happens if my broker does get laid off or quits because of the merger? 
</P>
<P>
 A. You will be transferred to a new broker. However, if you don't like the 
newcomer, you can ask to be transferred to somebody else, or you can follow 
your laid-off broker if he or she lands a job at another firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How would I follow my old broker? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Assuming your broker lands a job with a reputable investment house, you 
would simply have your shares transferred to your broker's new firm. You will 
have to fill out paperwork at both brokerages. The new firm will want a 
new-account statement specifying your risk profile and objectives. PaineWebber 
will need closing documents verifying that you've asked the company to close 
your account and transfer your shares elsewhere. There is no need to sell your 
shares or pay a commission.  
</P>
<P>
 Mutual funds may be trickier. Proprietary mutual funds have to be sold before 
you leave a firm. Further, some outside fund companies have arrangements to 
have their funds held by customers of certain brokerage firms and not others, 
so you may not be able to switch such mutual funds held in your account. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I'm not in love with my current broker, but at least I know he hasn't been 
indicted lately. How can I get the background of any new broker who may be 
assigned to my account? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The National Assn. of Securities Dealers has a toll-free "reference" line: 
(800) 289-9999. It's worth mentioning, however, that the NASD does not provide 
information about all types of complaints. Generally, the line picks up serious 
confirmed violations and sanctions but will not report information about 
pending actions, arbitration settlements or matters under appeal. The line 
operates between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. That doesn't sound very helpful. How do I make sure I'm not taken by a 
dishonest broker? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Remember: Most brokers are honest. However, your best defense against a bad 
investment -- or fraud -- is to be educated about your investments and 
investment options. The simplest rule of thumb is that if you don't understand 
an investment, pass. You may miss out on an opportunity here or there, but 
you'll also escape most of the scams. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think you've learned enough about investing, maybe you can try a 
discount broker who will charge you less but give you no advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What happens to my Kidder, or PaineWebber, mutual funds? Will they survive 
the merger? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Initially, yes. But over time PaineWebber and Kidder proprietary funds that 
have similar investment objectives are likely to be merged. At that point, 
PaineWebber would circulate documents explaining the changes to mutual fund 
investors and ask for their approval, Grano says. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a combination may prove positive for shareholders in PaineWebber 
funds, which have performed miserably this year, says Don Phillips, publisher 
of Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago. Since the beginning of the year, the 
performance of 75 of the 76 PaineWebber funds Morningstar tracks have ranked 
among the bottom 10% in their respective investment categories, Phillips says. 
Presumably, he predicts, PaineWebber would transfer some management 
responsibilities over to Kidder, which has performed somewhat better. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What if it goes the other way and the Kidder funds just perform worse? 
</P>
<P>
 A. That's possible, of course. Generally, anytime there is a management change 
at your fund or investment company, you should be extra vigilant about watching 
performance, Phillips says. Managers are pivotal in this business. If your 
fund's performance lags over the next 18 months, look for greener pastures. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What about my branch? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Kidder now has 52 branch offices, many in the same towns as PaineWebber 
offices. Presumably some of the low-traffic branches will close. The company 
said it does not yet know which ones.

6 CHARGED IN SBA LOAN APPLICATION FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Pasadena banker and a former Westminster loan broker were among six people 
charged Monday in an alleged scheme to falsify Small Business Administration 
loan applications, leading to a rash of defaults. 
</P>
<P>
 The banker, Michael Mahoney, 29, was charged in federal court in Los Angeles 
with accepting kickbacks of $35,477 in 1990, most of it from broker Ty Huu 
Pham, 56. Four individual borrowers were also charged. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second batch of criminal actions stemming from a three-year probe 
by the SBA and FBI of widespread fraudulent loan applications in Southern 
California.  
</P>
<P>
 Pham allegedly paid Mahoney, then a loan officer at the Bank of Industry, for 
recommending approval of about 20 SBA loan applications that Pham put together. 
Twelve of those loans have since gone into default at a cost of about $2 
million to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney, who for the last two years has been vice president and head of the 
SBA lending department at Citizens Bank in Pasadena, did not return calls 
Monday. But at Monday's arraignment, his attorney, James Riddet, indicated that 
his client would plead guilty today. Mahoney faces up to 30 years in prison and 
$1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham, 56, is expected to plead guilty next month to three counts of bank 
fraud, according to Nathan Hochman, the assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles 
who brought the charges against Pham and Mahoney. Pham faces a maximum 90 years 
in prison and $3 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a collusive effort on all their parts, and the government was a big 
loser here," said Steve Marica, assistant inspector general for the SBA in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA officials said they looked at 24 loans Pham helped clients acquire and 
that 16 of those loans have failed, costing banks and the SBA more than $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, a federal grand jury indicted six borrowers on charges of 
making false statements to obtain about $1 million worth of SBA loans. At the 
time, investigators said five of those borrowers went to the same Westminster 
loan packager, but officials did not identify him as Pham until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal charges were also filed Monday against four additional borrowers who 
allegedly obtained a total of $720,000 in fraudulent business loans with Pham's 
help. All of those loans have since failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The four borrowers charged Monday are Dinh Nguyen, who operated a clothing 
business in Orange County and now lives in Seattle; Thuan Phuc Nguyen, who had 
a liquor store in Lake Elsinore, and Alan Nam Nguyen and Jeannie Trinh Luong, 
an Irvine couple who had a trading firm in Garden Grove.

COMPANY TOWN; SAVOY, FOX RESTRUCTURE VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to speed government clearance and deflate objections to its 
proposed purchase of TV stations, SF Broadcasting has changed its corporate 
structure. But NBC said it will continue to challenge the deals. 
</P>
<P>
 SF Broadcasting, owned by Savoy Pictures Entertainment Inc. and News Corp.'s 
Fox Television Stations Inc., had formed limited liability companies to buy TV 
stations in Green Bay, Wis., and three other cities. It planned to make them 
affiliates of the Fox TV network. 
</P>
<P>
 Savoy executives had all of the voting power under the original structure; Fox 
and Savoy had no votes. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC recently complained that the arrangement appeared to be aimed at enabling 
Fox to circumvent Federal Communications Commission limits on how many stations 
one company can own. The Green Bay station is its affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 FCC rules set the limit at 12. Fox already owns nine stations. SF Broadcasting 
said its stations would not be counted against the Fox total. 
</P>
<P>
 In a filing with the FCC, SF Broadcasting said Friday that it has converted 
the company formed to buy WLUK in Green Bay into a corporation in which Savoy 
Pictures would have 75% of the equity and all of the voting shares. Fox would 
own 25% of the equity and no voting shares. The Savoy executives would not be 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Herwitz, president and chief executive of SF Broadcasting, said the new 
structure has been used in hundreds of station buyouts and should eliminate 
objections to the ownership arrangement. The stations would not count against 
Fox's station limit because Fox has no voting control over them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said similar changes will be made in the applications SF Broadcasting filed 
to buy stations in Honolulu, New Orleans and Mobile, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC still has objections, said its general counsel, Richard Cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 He said NBC will ask the FCC to examine how much control Fox has over their 
hiring and network affiliation and over the stations' financial matters.

COMPANY TOWN; 'MONEY TRAIN' RUNNING ON TIME FOR FALL '95 RELEASE 
</P>

 Producer Jon Peters' "Money Train" is on track, which is good news for 
beleaguered Sony Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's Columbia Pictures unit confirmed that actor Woody Harrelson 
climbed on board the $40-million action film Monday.Shooting for the film, 
whose release is planned for next fall, will start in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrelson, who was represented by Creative Artists Agency, will again team up 
with actor Wesley Snipes. The two previously starred in the hit "White Men 
Can't Jump." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Ruben, whose credits include "Sleeping With the Enemy" and "The Good 
Son," will direct. 
</P>
<P>
 Producing with Peters will be Neil Canton, brother of Mark Canton, chairman of 
Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Cos. Fred Pierce is executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement is an important morale booster for Columbia, which trumpeted 
the development as part of its continuing effort to convince Hollywood that it 
is breaking out of a gridlock in getting projects moving. Tracy Barone, who 
heads the creative end of Peters' operation, called the Snipes-Harrelson 
pairing "an explosive combination." 
</P>
<P>
 "Money Train" is about two cops who grew up together in a foster home. They 
eventually decide to rob the subway train that carries the money collected from 
each station. Columbia President Lisa Henson described it as something of a 
"modern-day stagecoach robbery." 
</P>
<P>
 "Money Train" is one of the high-profile Peters projects Sony Pictures is 
following through in making. Peters served briefly as co-chairman of Sony 
Pictures from 1989 to 1991, before he returned, with a Sony deal, to producing. 
In March, he returned to Warner Bros., where he and former partner Peter Guber 
had produced the hit "Batman" after Sony gave him the freedom to work at other 
studios.

MICRON TECHNOLOGY TO BUY 89% STAKE OF PC MAKER ZEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Micron Technology Inc. said it signed a letter of intent to buy 89% of 
struggling personal computer maker Zeos International Ltd. for an undisclosed 
sum. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the agreement, two units of Micron would trade their shares for 
89% of the shares of Minneapolis-based Zeos.The remaining 11% would be held by 
existing shareholders, the companies said. Other terms of the transaction were 
not disclosed and company officials would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Zeos' closing stock price Friday, the stake is worth about $44.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeos shares closed unchanged Monday at $5 on Nasdaq volume of 1.3 million, 
more than 20 times its daily average volume of 64,000 for the past three 
months. Micron closed down 87.5 cents at $33.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeos, which had a loss of $13.4 million on $229.1 million in revenue in the 
last fiscal year, would become part of Micron Computer Inc. and Micron Custom 
Manufacturing Services Inc. Micron Computer makes personal computers and Micron 
Custom makes custom electronics for other electronics makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, three top executives of Boise, Ida.-based Micron left the company 
over disagreements with the board about how fast the company should grow and 
whether the company should stay in the PC business. Micron makes semiconductor 
memory chips and other electronics for PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase shows that Micron is committing itself to the PC business, said 
Richard Whittington, an analyst at Soundview Financial Group.

COMEDY NOTES; SATURDAY AFTERNOON FUNNIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to be kid- and community-friendly, the Brea Improv will launch a 
weekly 90-minute variety show Oct. 29. "Every week will be a different show, 
with jugglers, dancers, magicians and fire-eaters -- all geared toward kids," 
said Michael Wulffhart, who's directing and coordinating the project. 
</P>
<P>
 To give the Saturday afternoon shows continuity, Wulffhart is looking for an 
actor or comedian who works well with kids to emcee the event. The shows will 
also offer a children's lunch. $5, plus lunch. Doors open at noon, curtain at 
1. (714) 529-7878. . . . Also coming up at the club will be a special night 
Oct. 28 with Gino Michellini, host of the popular "5 O'Clock Funnies" on 
KLOS-FM 95.5. Occasionally, Michellini puts on a show featuring the 
most-requested comics on his program. This night will star Craig Shoemaker, 
Mack & Jamie and Steve McGrew. $15. 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. . . . For the next 
several weeks, the club is continuing "Absolute Madness," but the big news is 
the show's community outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really been a lot of fun," Robert Hartman, an Improv regional manager, 
reported Monday. It's only about four minutes of the show, but already the club 
has attracted a woman who plays her nose, a tap-dancing grandmother who also 
performed something resembling a back flip, an impressionist, a fire-eater and 
someone with absolutely no talent but who was dying to be in the show. "We 
rehearsed him once or twice and put him on stage. The audience loved him," 
Wulffhart said. 
</P>
<P>
 CRAZY GUEST: The Orange County Crazies have scored a coup. Gary Austin, 
founder of the 20-year-old L.A. Groundlings, will be guest host and perform 
with the Crazies on Oct. 29 in their new "Romancing the Orange." The show opens 
Saturday. Austin directed the Groundlings for its first five years and now 
spends his time teaching in L.A. and New York. $12. 8 p.m. (714) 550-9900. 
Meanwhile, the Crazies are seeking nominations for their Orange Peel awards, 
given to a group or individuals who have distinguished themselves with acts of 
foolishness or embarrassment at work, home or play. Submit your choices in 
letter form (signed by at least one witness) or on a VHS videocassette. Send 
them to: O.C. Crazies, c/o Orange Peel Award, P.O. Box 4444, Santa Ana, CA 
92702. One winner per month will be paraded before an audience whenever the 
Crazies have a show in production. 
</P>
<P>
 LAUGHING ALL THE WAY: The Irvine Improv will be offering nothing but pun, pun, 
pun Thursday when nerd-boy Haywood Banks stops in for three days. Not a 
household name on the West Coast, Banks, the brainchild of Stuart Mitchell, has 
been selling out houses on the East Coast. $8-$12. (714) 854-5455. 
</P>
<P>
 BENEFITS: Also coming up at the Irvine Improv are a couple of benefits. On 
Wednesday, the Musical Theatre Company is raising money for its 1994-95 season. 
Legendary lounge lizards Sal and Amanda Gecko (George Quick and Beth Hansen) 
will sing selections from upcoming shows. Tickets are $35-$50 for dinner and 
the show. Reception at 6 p.m. Singing and comedy about 8:30. (800) 990-6874. . 
. . On Sunday, COPES and the Exchange Club Child Abuse Prevention Center team 
up to present Evan Davis and Carlos Alazraqui for a night of dinner and comedy. 
$35. 8 p.m. (714) 721-6633. 
</P>
<P>
 HOLD THE TOMATOES: Jerry Mabbott's Comedy Revue is heading to the Pizza Store, 
25610 Alicia Parkway, Laguna Hills, on Saturday. Hosted by Bill Word, the 
performance stars Ron J. Ruhman, with Dave Carlaw, Tim Roland, Neil Stevenson 
and Joey Sims. Free. 8 p.m. (714) 951-9011. The local troupe can also be seen 
at 7:30 p.m. every Thursday at Shoe-Bops in the Buena Park Hotel. $6, with a 
two-item minimum. (714) 995-1111. . . . Tuesday night comedy shows produced and 
hosted by Word have found a new home, too. After 92 consecutive weeks at the 
Blue Marble Coffeehouse in Costa Mesa, the troupe moved to Totally Coffee, also 
in Costa Mesa, where it celebrated show No. 100 last week. Show No. 101 is 
tonight, featuring Susan Dinkel, Matt Moore, Guy Roney and others. Free. 8 p.m. 
(714) 435-9367.

MUCKENTHALER CENTER FACES VOTE TODAY ON PRIVATIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to vote today whether to begin transferring 
operation of the Muckenthaler Cultural Center from the city to a private 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The financially strapped city has decreased its support of the center by about 
30% during the past three years.Still, this year it will spend $260,000 for 
center operations and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a contract to be considered today, responsibility for 50% of the 
operational costs would be transferred to the Muckenthaler Cultural Center 
Foundation board by 1997. The city would continue to pay for most center 
maintenance, repairs and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting center director Joe Felz, who predicts that the council will accept the 
contract, said "we anticipate entering into a longer contract after (1997), 
with the expectation of eventual total privatization, (although) the city will 
probably always insure the center and maintain the park" surrounding it. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which sets policy and programming, began discussing privatization 
two years ago in the wake of the first city cutbacks and now contends it can 
better raise private funds if the center is privately run. The theory is that 
donors are more generous to institutions that lack city support or governance, 
according to Felz.  
</P>
<P>
 The contract would be effective Nov. 1 and specifies that "the center will be 
operated similar to past years, offering a variety of arts exhibitions, theater 
programs and fund raising events." The center was built in 1924 as an Italian 
Renaissance style home for Walter and Adella Muckenthaler, who donated the 
property to the city in 1965.

NEWS ANALYSIS; LAWYER MATCHUPS SHAPE TENOR OF SIMPSON TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the O.J. Simpson murder trial winds its way through a slew of pretrial 
hearings and courtroom contests, its principal opponents are pairing off like 
sparring partners, setting the stage for a series of dramatic and startlingly 
different legal confrontations in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the scrappy duo of Barry Scheck and Lisa Kahn, a volatile pair whose 
sarcastic faceoffs have made them a favorite of the press corps. And there is 
the supercharged conflict between Marcia Clark and Robert L. Shapiro, two of 
the lead lawyers who have collided in a series of increasingly bitter 
confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the third piece of the Simpson legal triangle: Johnnie L. 
Cochran Jr. and William Hodgman, a pair of easygoing, experienced litigators 
who have worked together and against each other over the years. Unlike the 
other four principal lawyers in the case, their disagreements are tempered by 
their mutual admiration, and their arguments are models of civility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're kind of an anomaly in this case," Cochran said. "We get along." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer matchups will shape the tenor and tempo of the Simpson trial, 
influencing the way jurors hear evidence and, if Superior Court Judge Lance A. 
Ito allows cameras to remain in the courtroom, providing a national television 
audience with a glimpse of the vastly different styles of six talented, highly 
regarded attorneys arguing the biggest case of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have called this the trial of the century because of its 
notoriety," said Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor who has closely followed 
the Simpson case. "In addition to that, it will be a fascinating case to watch 
because of the superb collection of lawyers and the matchups between them." 
</P>
<P>
 First up will be the DNA lawyers, Kahn and Scheck, a pair of attorneys whose 
animated disagreements have livened up many a dry, technical hearing. Reporters 
have dubbed the Scheck and Kahn sessions "The Barry and Lisa Show," and for 
good reason: When Kahn and Scheck argue, observers can count on the debate 
being long, personal and mean. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Scheck asked that Ito sanction his counterpart for failing to turn 
over DNA evidence and for waiting too long to begin some tests. Kahn responded 
by accusing Scheck and his partner, lawyer Peter Neufeld, of deluging the 
prosecution and its labs with frivolous requests intended only to gum up the 
testing process and to make it impossible for prosecutors to present their 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kahn offered one concession, Scheck dismissed it as "ice in winter." And 
when she accused him of trying to subject DNA tests to his own analysis, he 
responded by denying it and by noting that she continually mispronounced his 
name -- she calls him "Scheckt." 
</P>
<P>
 By all appearances, Ito has not taken a particular liking to either of the DNA 
litigators. He has upbraided Scheck for his long-windedness and for raising 
irrelevant issues. And he openly expressed his frustration with Kahn when she 
struggled to produce a satisfactory explanation for why certain DNA tests were 
not initiated for months after the June 12 murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no delay," Kahn argued. 
</P>
<P>
 "The delay seems apparent," Ito responded archly, glaring down from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Ito's evident disdain for the squabbling between Scheck and Kahn -- he 
called it unhelpful and annoying -- their conflict has barely begun. The two 
lawyers will occupy center stage in early November when they square off to 
argue the admissibility of DNA evidence in the case. That hearing could 
determine the course of the entire trial, and virtually no one expects either 
Kahn or Scheck to become suddenly conciliatory before then. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't turn it off and on," said Harland W. Braun, an experienced criminal 
defense lawyer and former deputy district attorney. "You react intuitively. You 
fall back on your instincts." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the DNA hearing is concluded -- which both sides hope will be sometime 
before Thanksgiving -- Kahn and Scheck will at least temporarily recede to the 
sidelines, to be followed by the four lawyers who will dominate the trial and 
whose courtroom personalities are as different as their intensity is alike. 
</P>
<P>
 All four -- Cochran, Shapiro, Hodgman and Clark -- are expected to play 
significant roles in the trial. And some issues or witnesses are likely to pit 
them in varying combinations. So far, the matchups have generally shaped up as 
Shapiro vs. Clark and Hodgman vs. Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when Hodgman was out sick last week, Shapiro offered to even up the 
sides by sending Cochran home. Instead, Ito elected to give both sides the day 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro and Clark have occupied center stage in the Simpson case since the 
preliminary hearing, when they led their respective sides in front of a 
transfixed national television audience. Both instantly became household names: 
For weeks, their style of questioning, ability to argue, even their hairstyles 
were grist for analysis and the topics of conversations from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro was praised for deftly handling witnesses during the preliminary 
hearing; Clark for relentlessly and successfully arguing against the defense's 
attempts to suppress evidence seized in a series of searches of Simpson's home 
and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, both lawyers came under nit-picking scrutiny for everything 
from their courtroom manner to the way they dress. On the last subject, at 
least Clark seems to have heard the critique, as observers have noted that she 
has projected a kinder, gentler image in recent court hearings. She toned down 
her sharp edges even further last week when she spoke to prospective jurors for 
the first time, lowering her voice and gently coaxing answers from some of the 
jury candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you nervous?" she asked the first prospective juror. When the woman 
replied that she was, Clark added: "Me too." 
</P>
<P>
 Few who have watched Clark's unyielding courtroom performances believed that, 
and it was all defense attorneys could do to keep a straight face. "We're all 
wondering how long she can keep up this personality transplant," one of 
Simpson's lawyers said later. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost from the first session, Shapiro and Clark were at each other's throats: 
Before Simpson's preliminary hearing had begun, Shapiro wrested a grudging 
concession from Clark that police had not found a bloody ski mask at the scene 
of the crime -- a discovery reported "exclusively" and erroneously by a local 
television station. 
</P>
<P>
 That confrontation seemed to set the stage for their subsequent battles, and 
in the past three months, the two lawyers have gone from aggressive adversaries 
to bitter antagonists. Each has accused the other of grandstanding for the 
courtroom camera. Each has charged the other with misrepresenting evidence and 
even with defying the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Shapiro asked Ito to sanction prosecutors for failing to introduce 
their jury consultants to prospective jurors; Clark, trembling with anger, 
responded by asking Ito to report Shapiro to the State Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are both sides finished?" an exasperated Ito asked after that exchange. (He 
declined to take action against either.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, members of the defense team chortle over Shapiro's willingness to take 
on Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to match up Shapiro and Clark wherever I can," said Cochran, the 
defense team's premier trial lawyer and its emerging central figure. "Bob 
really gets her angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Where the Clark-Shapiro faceoff seems motivated by genuine dislike and the 
Scheck-Kahn contest is fueled by a pair of tough-minded foes, the matchup 
between Cochran and Hodgman is a dispute of an entirely different sort. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two men are the case's most experienced trial lawyers and also are its 
closest professional friends. Cochran, a former high-ranking member of the 
district attorney's office, hired Hodgman as a prosecutor in 1979 and has 
publicly praised his former subordinate's formidable skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Clark and Shapiro have accused each other of lying, stalling and 
cheating, the exchanges between Cochran and Hodgman are marked by genteel 
expressions of mutual respect. 
</P>
<P>
 During one recent session, Hodgman complimented Cochran and his staff for 
meeting informally with him to discuss evidence sharing, a process that Hodgman 
said was working well. Recently, Cochran pulled his former associate aside to 
assure him that no matter how contentious the case gets, he expects to emerge 
from it with his high regard for Hodgman intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "The others will come and go," Cochran said of the other attorneys. "They may 
never see each other again. But Bill and I will be back here. We've known each 
other a long time, and we'll know each other for a long time after this is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cochran and Hodgman like and respect each other, longtime associates 
of both say their easygoing veneer should not be misinterpreted. Both are 
fierce advocates. And neither is fond of losing. 
</P>
<P>
 As Cochran put it: "We're deadly serious about our sides." 
</P>
<P>
 They have faced each other across a courtroom before: Cochran won an acquittal 
for actor Todd Bridges in 1990 on charges of shooting a drug dealer, a case 
that Hodgman prosecuted. That trial was aggressively fought by both lawyers, 
associates say, but ended without rancor between Hodgman and Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hodgman is not inclined to let Cochran get away with anything just 
because they admire one another: When Cochran used his questioning of 
prospective jurors to suggest that a hung jury was nothing to be ashamed of, 
Hodgman accused his counterpart of trying to place a "subliminal message" in 
the minds of jurors. He reminded them that they should be flexible and should 
listen to their fellow jurors in their effort to return a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to fight really hard, but at the end of this we're going to 
respect each other," Cochran said. "I don't know if you can say that about the 
other lawyers in this case."

COLUMN ONE; GERMANY: A WAVE OF 'OSTALGIA'; THOSE FROM THE EAST ARE LOOKING BACK 
FONDLY, EVEN ON THE HARD TIMES UNDER THE COMMUNISTS. THEY'RE EVEN TAKING PRIDE 
IN DRIVING THEIR CLUNKY TRABANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "What makes people drive Trabants?" 
</P>
<P>
 Albrecht Reither considers the question almost shyly for a moment, sitting in 
an auto shop decorated with poster-sized photos of the tinny, toylike car, East 
Germany's contribution to the automotive world. 
</P>
<P>
 How, indeed, to explain to an outsider why anyone today would still want to 
suffer the Trabant's noisy two-stroke engine, dollhouse interior, the acrid 
products of its notion of an exhaust system? 
</P>
<P>
 East Germany is long gone, and the Trabant -- which, unfortunately for the 
East Germans, means "satellite" -- is no longer in production. There are no 
Trabbi dealerships. To get a Trabbi today, you have to go well out of your way 
to find one on the secondhand market and be prepared to withstand the ridicule 
of your fellow Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Reither, a burly spare-parts dealer, turns defiant. "The Trabant is a 
symbol of protest," he says. "People are saying: 'I drove this car for 30 
years, and I'm going to keep driving it. I'm not ashamed to be from the east.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Time was, eastern Germans wanted to get clear of anything associated with 
their Communist past. From bad coffee to the ideological water torture of 
official discourse, from the baleful Trabbi to the tiresome workplace habit of 
eating bologna sandwiches every time a colleague had a birthday -- in the weeks 
and months immediately after the Berlin Wall fell, people wanted to discard all 
of these fixtures of socialist life and anything else that had to do with East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Of late, however, a wave of nostalgia for Ostdeutschland -- call it Ostalgia, 
as many do -- has been washing over eastern Germany. Today, people are driving 
their Trabbis with a vengeance, to the point of joining Trabbi outing clubs and 
parading through the eastern German countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 Shops specializing in made-in-the-East groceries and household products are 
opening, and it has become socially acceptable to drink eastern Germany's 
sugar-sweet Little Red Riding Hood sparkling wine and to serve eastern 
Germany's more chewy dinner rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostalgia parties are very much the thing on eastern German campuses. Even the 
former East German practice of giving all 14-year-olds a sort of secular "first 
Communion" service -- the Jugendweihe, or "youth blessing" -- has been 
enthusiastically revived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people have quickly found out that the dream of the golden West was just 
an illusion," contends Reither, who had the commercial sense to buy all the 
Trabbi parts he could find and who now does a thriving trade in them. He has 
made enough money to buy a Mercedes or a BMW, but his sense of eastern identity 
keeps him behind the wheel of his 1974 Trabbi. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Germans have had nearly five years now to plumb the joys of Western 
capitalism, and, as Reither says, many have found them wanting. 
</P>
<P>
 True, they no longer have to live with shootings at the Wall, a censored 
press, the largest spying network in the Marxist world, or the many other 
instruments of East German state power. 
</P>
<P>
 But some have come to the arresting conclusion that they are worse off today 
than they were under communism. Many men have lost their jobs. Women have lost 
child-care centers that cost 20 cents a day; practically all households are 
paying many times more for rent and sustenance. 
</P>
<P>
 And even the eastern Germans who now have "made it" -- who have bigger 
apartments, interesting jobs, telephones, fax machines, plausible newspapers, 
strawberries year-round -- even these easterners talk of a certain something 
that is missing from their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, in part, a sense of belonging: They know they aren't East Germans 
anymore, but five years of unification have convinced them that they don't 
quite fit into the West either. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if they aren't East Germans, and they aren't West Germans, then what are 
they?

 The current conspicuous return to old ways may be, for easterners, a means of 
finding out. And if nothing else, it serves for many as a heartening reminder 
that everything about life in the German Democratic Republic wasn't thoroughly 
evil -- that life in the East was in some respects actually better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anyone who says they want the whole German Democratic Republic 
back," says Hans-Joachim Maaz, a psychiatrist in the eastern German city of 
Halle who has written on the special psychological problems of his compatriots. 
"What I hear about is the lack of values. People say, 'We don't want to live in 
a society where everyone is elbowing their way to the front. We want to have a 
sense of solidarity. And we want to live in a society where money doesn't 
influence everything, even relationships between friends.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragedy," adds Maaz, "is that there is nobody who really takes these 
desires seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, almost nobody. 
</P>
<P>
 On a busy street in what used to be East Berlin, Klaus Eichler has carved out 
a specialty business centered on Ostalgia: He packages tours for eastern 
Germans who now miss the very thing they would have spurned in the past -- 
group tours, laced with nonstop ideology, to the old glory spots of the 
socialist world. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested in the space race from the Soviet point of view? Eichler has a tour 
to Baikonur, the Russian Cape Canaveral, where participants undergo mock 
cosmonaut training and watch a rocket launching. The tour guide is a former 
East German cosmonaut, Sigmund Jaehn. 
</P>
<P>
 Or what about those who like to mix a little sunshine and surf with their 
politics? For them, Eichler offers two weeks in Cuba, in the capable hands of 
East Germany's former ambassador to Havana, Hans Langer. Langer takes the 
Ostalgic tourists to the beaches but also books political discussions with 
Cuban doctors, farmers and members of the Asamblea Nacional.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we have to admit that there wasn't enough that was good about East 
Germany. Otherwise it wouldn't have failed," he says. "But, nevertheless, I 
think that quite a few people here believe that in East German times we enjoyed 
a more peaceful way of life, even a more pleasant way of life. It's difficult 
to explain this, but it has something to do with human feelings and with values 
-- with the feeling that my neighbor was my friend, and not my competitor." 
</P>
<P>
 Eichler thinks eastern Germany's fixation with the past may be a sign that a 
broader quest is under way for a new ideology -- some sort of economic 
arrangement that is neither capitalism nor communism. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand why eastern Germans feel the way they do, look with eastern eyes 
at the way German unification has turned out. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early, heady months after the Berlin Wall was breached, people dreamed 
big dreams of what the future might hold once unification was complete: People 
would vote in free elections; they would enjoy real representation in an 
authentic national assembly; inefficient state enterprises would be reorganized 
and the public would become shareholders; a new, all-German constitution would 
combine the best elements of the East with those of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 But as reunification took hold, it became clear that West Germany had no 
intention of retaining what may have been "good" about the East. 
</P>
<P>
 Free elections were held, true enough, but West German political parties sent 
in candidates and dominated the political scene. Far from making easterners 
shareholders in their former country's industrial stock, the unified government 
sold much of what was salable to outside investors. New, private owners, in 
many cases, then laid off the easterners by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 As for a new constitution: It is still being brought up to date, but so far, 
nothing from East Germany has been kept. 
</P>
<P>
 The way things have turned out, the only East German artifact that the unified 
government has preserved has been the freedom to turn right on some red lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why people like Werner Riedel have set about saving bits and pieces 
all by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The practice of celebrating the youth blessing in the German Democratic 
Republic was not 100% bad," says Riedel, who plucked that East German custom 
off the endangered list in 1990 and has revived it virtually single-handedly. 
"It was just sort of exploited by ideology and forced on people." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. In former times, when East Germans turned 14, they were put through 
indoctrination courses, then formally initiated into adulthood in a public 
ceremony. The young people took an oath and were presented with a book about 
their place in the universe, "The Cosmos, the Earth, and the Human Being." 
Then, typically, doting relatives took them home, showered them with gifts and 
fed them a big lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember my own youth blessing," says Riedel. "It was sort of 
automatic. I've forgotten the oath, but I still remember all the presents I 
got, and the big meal." 
</P>
<P>
 In the turbulent months after the East German government collapsed, Riedel 
says he began worrying about young people and thinking maybe they needed proof 
that somebody cared about them. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, he says, their parents were thrown out of work and spending all 
of their time trying to survive. Riedel thought the old youth blessing might 
put much-needed structure back into their lives -- as long as it was stripped 
of its former ideological content. 
</P>
<P>
 He assembled a volunteer staff, organized a curriculum, printed up some 
brochures and has never looked back. Last year in Berlin, 8,000 14-year-olds 
received the new, post-Communist youth blessing -- 10 times as many as those 
who received their first Communion. Across eastern Germany, about 80,000 
adolescents are enrolled in the program this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, even the young people Riedel is catering to -- teen-agers who 
are too young to have arrived at much of an understanding of what it was to be 
an East German -- have joined the Ostalgia kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the goings-on at Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena, a city in the 
southern part of what used to be East Germany. Deep under the city's center, in 
a campus rathskeller, posters of the late East German dictator Erich Honecker 
share wall space with portraits of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the onetime Soviet 
leader, and the album covers of popular East German musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forward to the 300th Anniversary of the German Democratic Republic!" exhorts 
a banner over the dance floor. Young people swill Vita Cola, an East German 
soft drink, and an ersatz sangria made only with apples, pears and grapes (it 
was difficult to find imported fruit in East Germany, so no one ever had 
oranges or pineapples). 
</P>
<P>
 When a young man leaps onto the bar and begins singing, the whole crowd joins 
in: "Build, build, build! Help us to build a better society! We're going to 
construct a new homeland, for a better future!" It is an East German classic, 
and everybody knows the words. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an Ostalgia party, a rage on campuses all over the former East. 
University students show up in polyester clothing that would otherwise never 
make it out of the darkest corners of their wardrobes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the entrance, organizer Steffen Bernhardt sits at a table graced by a pile 
of transcripts of the late North Korean leader Kim Il Sung's speeches, taking 
money. He is 27, old enough to remember what it was like in the former times, 
when the student club was twice shut down by the authorities for minor 
ideological infractions. But he is prepared to explain why students today are 
embracing the symbols and impedimenta of the repressive system they used to 
hate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to deny our own history," he says. "These things are part of 
our lives, and that's why we keep them." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a shriek and a woman runs by, reeking of chemicals; a prankster has 
just anointed her with a discontinued East German deodorant. A tall man in an 
army jacket and an enormous red motorcycle helmet comes by, brandishing an old 
copy of Neues Deutschland, once the official newspaper of the East German 
Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had seen this newspaper five years ago, I'd have said, 'Oh, hell,' " 
says Dirk Spoerl, a 29-year-old handyman. "But now I can laugh about it." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are no nerds," adds Bernhardt. "We can speak like the West Germans. We can 
write like the West Germans. We are as tall as the West Germans. Yet everything 
from the German Democratic Republic is being destroyed. That is a mistake. It 
is history. History will never end."

READ HER LIPS: ANTI-TAX ACTIVIST SAYS 'I WAS WRONG'; FINANCES: COVINA 
COUNCILWOMAN WON OFFICE WITH STAND AGAINST UTILITY TAX. SHE SAYS HARSH REALITY 
FORCED FLIP-FLOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the confession of anti-taxer Linda Sarver. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Sarver admits, she led a successful campaign last year to recall the 
entire Covina City Council because it had passed a 6% utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, she later rode the anti-tax wave to a seat on the Covina council, 
running a campaign that emphasized the old "read my lips" vow of no new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then her new perspective struck: The fat that Sarver assumed was lying just 
under the skin of government turned out not to be there, she found. She came to 
believe that there was no way to balance the city budget without doing horrible 
things such as closing the city library and abolishing the Parks and Recreation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, yes, Sarver joined a council majority earlier this month that voted 
for a new, bigger utility tax of 8.25%. Joining her was another council member 
who had pledged not to impose the tax, Mayor Thomas M. O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wrong," Sarver said of her no-tax pledge. "Maybe I was a little naive; 
I thought we could make the cuts to make up the difference. At least I'm big 
enough to say I was wrong and do what's best for the community." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a cautionary tale about taxes and truth, about how simple things can 
look from the outside and how complicated they can be from the inside. It is a 
journey from "Throw the bums out," that sermon of the streets, to the Sermon on 
the Mount: "Judge not, that ye be not judged." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the judging goes on: Anti-tax forces are planning a new recall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Covina can no longer afford Tom O'Leary, Linda Sarver and Tom Falls" (a third 
councilman who voted for the tax after saying he was opposed to it), said 
William C. Mason, co-chairman of Covina Citizens for Good Government and an 
influential backer of the July, 1993, recall of Covina's council. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarver has a response for Mason: "It's easy to be an armchair quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 She should know. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarver got involved in the tax controversy as one of the founders of Covina's 
Stop the Utility Tax Committee, the group that sparked the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another example of how recall votes, particularly over local tax or fee 
issues, are growing more common, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite often the citizenry is persuaded that what is needed is a change of 
face," said Alan Heslop, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College 
who has studied the issue as a member of the California Constitutional Revision 
Commission. "And the citizenry thinks they will get a change of policy. And 
they don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarver entered the recall effort without ever studying the Covina city budget. 
Her true-believer assumption that she could find fat somewhere is a common 
contention among many recall proponents, Heslop said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very, very few people really understand city governments' different budgets," 
which have grown more complex over the years, he said. "Very, very many people 
involved in a recall don't understand the financial problems they face." 
</P>
<P>
 In hindsight, Sarver said, she and her council colleagues should have been 
aware of how tenuous a financial situation they were inheriting. 
</P>
<P>
 When they were elected, the one-year utility tax passed by their predecessors 
had just expired. The city was losing $11,000 in revenue every day it was not 
reimposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing not to collect that money, the new council balanced the 1994-95 
budget by using much of the city's reserves and cutting $1.7 million by axing 
11 positions and deferring some purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, however, the council members realized that they were only putting 
off the inevitable, and that a $2.3-million deficit loomed for the 1995-96 
budget, which will take effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Councilman) Tom Falls and I sat down together to see what we could cut for 
next year until we got to the point where we were shocked at the amount of 
services we were going to have to cut to come up with $2.3 million," Sarver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They concluded that they'd have to close the library, abolish the Parks and 
Recreation Department, shut down one of the city's three fire stations -- and 
still lay off 33 of the city's 213 full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Without those cuts, they decided, the city of 44,000 faced three options: a 
special district to assess fees for fire services, allowing a card club to do 
business or a utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up in the night after having arguments in my sleep over the decision," 
Sarver said. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilwoman said she attended dozens of meetings and called people who 
had been her supporters during the election in search of an answer. The 
residents said reimposing the utility tax was the way to go, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed, more speakers at the council's Oct. 4 meeting voiced support for 
the tax than opposition. The council went along on a 4-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The new tax will raise $3.6 million per year, about $185 per household. It 
should cover the deficit and provide funds for needed street repair while 
bolstering the police and fire departments. A final vote will be taken tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd be for a utility tax," said Sarver, a single mother of 
four. "I thought of my two younger children growing up in a community without a 
library, a parks department and good public safety. I did what was morally and 
ethically right and voted yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Falls: "I thought I may have committed political suicide, but I did 
what's best for the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor O'Leary said the moment that changed his mind about reimposing the tax 
occurred when a council member asked what would happen if the city went 
bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to do whatever I had to do to avoid that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary said he still doesn't care for a utility tax and would have preferred 
an assessment on property for fire services, but a council majority would not 
support the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The former council members who were recalled by Sarver and her colleagues by 
an almost 2-to-1 margin last year feel vindicated but peeved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the council owes us an apology (for criticizing the utility tax), and 
I think Sarver and O'Leary should resign," said former Mayor Henry M. Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarver and O'Leary say they don't regret the recall because the previous 
council acted arrogantly, approving the tax with a minimum of public comment at 
a 7 a.m. meeting. They were wrong about the taxes, they said, but not the 
people they threw out. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the council members elected last year on a no-new-tax policy, only 
Councilman John M. Wilcox stuck to his guns in this month's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they (Sarver, O'Leary and Falls) are hypocrites. They ran on a 
no-utility-tax platform," Wilcox said. Instead of a tax, he said he would like 
to see the city sell its Proposition A state transportation funds to another 
city, consider merging fire services with other communities and cut all city 
salaries by 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the recent council vote are also frosted because the council went 
against one of the guiding principles of anti-taxers everywhere: They didn't 
submit the utility tax to a vote of the people. Hank Vagt, a leader of last 
year's recall, said the lack of a vote the first time the utility tax was 
imposed was a key reason for the recall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary, an attorney who drafted last year's recall petition and who has given 
recall advice to residents of other cities who are considering such a move, 
said his change of heart has to be understood in the context of Covina 
residents' new willingness to pay such a tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "More people understand today than two years ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three more, anyway.

SENATE RACE SETS RECORD AT $27 MILLION AND RISING; CAMPAIGN: HUFFINGTON HAS 
OUTSPENT FEINSTEIN NEARLY 2 TO 1 IN COSTLIEST CONGRESSIONAL CONTEST, RECORDS 
SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's U.S. Senate race has set a record for the most expensive 
congressional contest in history even before entering the final and most costly 
month of campaigning, according to finance records released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sept. 30, the last day of the finance reporting period, Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein and her Republican challenger, Rep. Mike Huffington, had spent more 
than $27 million, breaking a 10-year-old record set when Sen. Jesse A. Helms 
(R-N.C.) and his opponent combined to spend $25.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The new reports also indicate that Huffington, a wealthy freshman congressman 
from Santa Barbara, set another national record for the most money ever spent 
by an individual congressional candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign has cost more than $18 million, with all but $1.2 
million coming out of the candidate's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 That is about double the amount reported Monday by Feinstein, who now looks 
like a political pauper despite her reputation as one of the top fund-raisers 
in Washington. Feinstein, who holds a narrow lead in recent opinion polls, has 
spent about $9.1 million on the race, including almost $1 million she has 
contributed to her own campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day when Mr. Smith could go to Washington, if that was ever true, passed 
a long time ago in California," Democratic political consultant Darry Sragow 
said of the reports. "I think the amount of money being spent here -- and the 
nature of the campaign, which is something less than inspirational -- will 
increase cynicism and decrease participation. This is not a plus for the 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 Every day since Jan. 1 the Senate candidates have spent an average of almost 
$100,000, the reports indicate. Huffington's daily rate for the year is almost 
$65,000, compared to about $33,000 for Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington entered the race almost entirely unknown and spent much of his 
money during the Republican primary last spring, when Feinstein was unopposed 
and largely absent from the campaign trail. In the last reporting period from 
July 1 to Sept. 30, Feinstein's per-day average increased to about $50,000, 
compared to about $70,000 for Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 The enormous cost of the Senate race is due almost entirely to the months of 
television commercials each candidate is purchasing in California's five major 
media markets. The campaigns have been spending $500,000 to $1 million per week 
on television. With a tight race in the final weeks, that spending will rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more than most statewide campaigns, the Senate race is becoming known for 
its reliance on television instead of personal appearances and for the hostile 
tone of the commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign's high price has become an issue between the candidates and has 
fueled a debate about the problems inherent in a system that requires 
candidates to have huge sums of money to be viable contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has criticized Feinstein for relying on powerful special interests 
to finance her campaign, while the incumbent has accused Huffington of trying 
to buy a Senate seat with his Texas oil and gas fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very undemocratic to have wealth and access to wealth be the 
determinant in who is a viable candidate," said Josh Goldstein, a director at 
the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington. "That basically excludes the 
vast majority of people and it means that voters are really just ratifying the 
choices that money has made." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's report indicated that the senator had just $218,000 left in cash 
about two weeks ago. However, her campaign said it is convinced it will be able 
to keep up with Huffington in the three weeks remaining before the Nov. 8 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata acknowledged that the campaign is 
still trying to raise the money it will need in the final weeks. He said many 
Democratic contributors need to be persuaded that Feinstein needs their help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worry all the time about complacency because, even though our supporters 
look at him and say, 'He's nothing' -- he is a rich nothing," Kuwata said. 
"There's not a day that goes by where I don't talk to people who say, 'There is 
no way he can win.' And I say, 'He's trying to buy this election.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington campaign officials said their spending was necessary because 
Feinstein had spent millions to become known in two previous statewide 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huffington has had to invest his own money in his campaign because he's 
battling a career incumbent," said GOP spokeswoman Jennifer Grossman. "Mike 
Huffington . . . is a citizen who has entered politics and, to be competitive 
in a state with a population as enormous as California's . . . it is very 
expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Monday's reports, the most money a candidate had ever reported spending 
on a congressional race was Helms' contest in 1990. The conservative North 
Carolina senator, fueled by a nationwide appeal for direct mail contributions, 
spent about $17.9 million in his last bid for election against Democrat Harvey 
Gantt, a former mayor of Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Virginia Republican Senate nominee Oliver L. North has tapped a 
similar vein of conservative contributions that have generated $15.2 million 
for his campaign. Washington political observers have been expecting both North 
and Huffington to break the previous record for an individual high-spending 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Senate race began, Huffington held the record for the most 
expensive House race. In his first bid for public office in 1992, he spent $5.2 
million of his own money -- about double the previous national record -- to 
unseat a veteran GOP incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, whose fortune is estimated at about $75 million, said during his 
recent debate with Feinstein that he is likely to spend more than $20 million 
on his Senate race. Based on his last report, however, California political 
watchers believe his total will be much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign has estimated that it will spend between $12 million and 
$15 million on the race all together. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign experts also note that in evaluating Huffington's spending, it is 
significant that he has spent little on fund raising. Most campaigns have to 
spend a significant amount to raise money by either holding lavish events or 
using extensive mailing lists to reach their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of fund raising varies among campaigns, but one expert said that 
candidates generally keep about 80 cents for every dollar contributed. That 
amount is higher later in the campaign, when interest in the race develops and 
money is easier to raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time for a reality check here," Sragow said about the campaign's cost. 
"The amount of money spent on this Senate race could feed a small nation for a 
year. The amount of money Dianne Feinstein has put into this race may pale by 
comparison to Huffington, but by the standards of 99% of Americans, it is still 
a huge amount. And the fact that that amount would be viewed as a mere pittance 
is a reflection of just how skewed the process really is."

U.S. AND RUSSIA EXCHANGE BARBS OVER IRAQ AT U.N. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. 
Kozyrev exchanged bristling barbs Monday in a rare public session of the 
Security Council that laid bare the deep divisions at the United Nations over 
lifting sanctions on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev wants the Security Council to start discussing eventual lifting of 
sanctions, and Albright insists that sanctions cannot be lifted until Saddam 
Hussein earns the trust of the members by complying with all U.N. resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev asked for the session to report on his Thursday meeting with Hussein 
in Baghdad, in which the Iraqi president announced his "readiness to resolve in 
a positive manner the issue of recognizing Kuwait's sovereignty and borders," 
and the Russian foreign minister promised to work toward lifting oil sanctions 
if Iraq cooperates for six months with a U.N. weapons-monitoring program. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Tarik Aziz, the deputy prime minister who serves as Hussein's main 
voice to the West, ignored demands for proof that Iraq's promised recognition 
of Kuwait is genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 While both the American and Russian diplomats at the Security Council 
professed that their differences reflected the disagreements of close friends, 
the United Nations had not seen such open argument between a Russian and an 
American ambassador since the days of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev, in fact, cast doubt on the Clinton Administration's perception of the 
recent Iraqi military maneuvers in the southern part of the country as a threat 
to Kuwait and to peace in the area. He did not, however, repeat his accusation, 
made to Moscow reporters, that the American military response had "an element 
of theatrical dramatization." 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of states, including Russia, had information concerning movements of 
troops planned by Iraq," the Russian foreign minister told the Security 
Council. " . . . And there were reports to the effect that Iraq was not 
planning to attack Kuwait. That information was available to many states." 
</P>
<P>
 This drew a sharp response from Albright. "I hope that no government on this 
council seriously doubts the danger that we avoided last week," she said. "The 
military threat was real." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that only the American-led military buildup had deterred the Iraqis. 
Although she did not offer any more details to the council, the Pentagon 
reported in Washington that Iraqi forces were continuing to retreat from the 
area around Nasiriyah where they had dug in during the weekend, easing the 
tensions in the region. Authorities said the withdrawal was likely to be over 
within a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev had sharp comments for the swiftness with which American officials 
dismissed his agreement with Hussein. He said some of the condemnations came 
even before the officials had read the communique. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that these inadequate and misguided assessments can be written off as 
a result of the intensity of the crisis and of those emotions which overcame 
all of us at that time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian foreign minister then repeated the argument of the communique: The 
Security Council should lift the embargo on oil if Iraq cooperates for six 
months with the U.N. monitors trying to make sure that Hussein does not embark 
on a massive rearmament program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Security Council must be ready to take yes for an answer," he said. "If 
Iraq really complies with all the demands in all of the resolutions, then, of 
course, the present sanction system loses its sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Albright, however, repeated the longstanding American position that no matter 
what the fine print of the resolution, it makes no sense to lift any sanctions 
until Hussein complies with all resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic premise we have heard from some," she said, "is that Iraq should be 
rewarded for partial compliance with some of its obligations. The council 
should categorically reject that approach. . . . Iraq must not be led to 
believe that it can choose in an a la carte fashion among these obligations." 
</P>
<P>
 She maintained, moreover, that Iraqi credibility is so low that if the United 
Nations followed Kozyrev's approach and lifted oil sanctions, Iraq could not be 
trusted to continue cooperating with a U.N. monitoring system afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 During the debate, in which French Ambassador Jean-Bertrand Merimee supported 
the Russian position and British Ambassador David Hannay supported the American 
position, almost all ambassadors insisted that Iraq must recognize Kuwait in 
accordance with the Iraqi constitution -- through proclamations by Baghdad's 
Revolutionary Command Council and Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Deputy Prime Minister Aziz told reporters this was "under 
consideration," he made no such pledge to the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 This prompted Albright to tell the council, "We simply cannot trust words and 
stated intentions from an Iraq which has shown its continued disdain for 
adherence to its commitments. Words are cheap. Actions are the coin of the 
realm." 
</P>
<P>
 Hannay even implied that it would be difficult to lift sanctions so long as 
Hussein ruled Iraq. He insisted that the lifting of sanctions would depend on 
answers to questions like how to prevent Iraq from regaining enough strength to 
turn against its neighbors in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing, however, is clear," he said, "and that is that the continued 
presence of Saddam Hussein as president of Iraq makes these questions more 
difficult to answer satisfactorily." 
</P>
<P>
 In Baghdad on Monday, the Parliament met to consider Iraq's relations with the 
United Nations and other topics, adjourning without revealing whether it had 
voted on the U.N. demand that Iraq recognize Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Iraqi government stepped up its public relations efforts to increase 
pressure for a lifting of sanctions, saying that the embargo amounted to 
"killing people in order to achieve a political end." 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting with Western reporters Monday night, Trade Minister Mohammed Saleh 
sounded alternately self-pitying and defiant. 
</P>
<P>
 He called Iraq "one of the richest countries in the world" and then added: 
"But now Iraq is not even able to provide for its own people." 
</P>
<P>
 Saleh appeared with what he said was a monthly government food ration package 
on a conference table. It was made up of less than half a bottle of cooking 
oil, some plastic bags of rice and flour, several cans of baby milk and some 
other goods -- all amounting, he said, to little more than a third of the 
requirements for a single person.

CAUSES OF SIMILAR 737 JET CRASHES STILL A MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two plane crashes were eerily similar. And thus far the searches for what 
caused them have proven similarly frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 The first crash -- near Colorado Springs, Colo., on March 3, 1991 -- involved 
a Boeing 737 jetliner that was preparing to land. Suddenly and without warning, 
United Airlines Flight 585 banked steeply to one side and plunged nose-first 
into the ground, killing all 25 people on board. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board -- which in 27 years has solved more 
than 1,000 transport-aircraft crash mysteries -- supplemented its own personnel 
with experts from the airline, the pilots' union, the National Weather Service, 
the Federal Aviation Administration and the firms that manufactured the plane 
and its components in an exhaustive effort to figure out what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 They examined the wreckage, studied readouts from the plane's two "black box" 
recording devices, interviewed witnesses and used computer-generated "flights" 
in cockpit simulators in an effort to re-create the flight path of the doomed 
jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
 As the weeks stretched into months, the NTSB found it was coming up with more 
questions than answers. And in the end -- for only the fourth time in the 
agency's history -- the crash detectives had to admit defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an equation with too many unknowns," said John Lauber, the NTSB member 
who headed the Colorado investigation. "And there will always be the lingering 
fear that we overlooked something." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Sept. 8 of this year, another Boeing 737 crashed while preparing to 
land -- this time near Pittsburgh, Pa. Once again, suddenly and without 
warning, the jet banked steeply to one side and then plunged nose-first into 
the ground. USAir Flight 427 carried 132 passengers and crew members, and again 
there were no survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB launched another investigation, taking note of the many similarities 
between the two accidents. Now, more than six weeks into the new inquiry, 
investigators have come up with a few theories, but they have to admit that the 
Pittsburgh crash has them stymied. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Vogt, the NTSB member heading the Pittsburgh investigation, is 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of now, it's an unsolved crash," he said. "But we're confident we'll 
figure this one out." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Schiff, a veteran airline pilot and respected air-safety consultant 
involved in the investigation of a number of crashes, is not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dollars to doughnuts, they won't find the cause," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff's pessimism stems from the obliteration of evidence in the high-speed 
impact of Flight 427 and from his own studies of the Colorado crash, an 
accident that still confounds the experts. After more than 20 months of 
detective work, the NTSB admitted on Dec. 8, 1992, that it "could not identify 
conclusive evidence to explain the loss of United Airlines Flight 585." 
</P>
<P>
 The best the federal agency could do was identify the "two most likely events" 
that could have spun the plane out of control and hurled it to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these was a "rotor wind" -- a horizontal tornado created by the strong, 
gusting winds that were spilling over the crests of the Rocky Mountains that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 However, no such wind ever measured has been strong enough to knock down an 
airliner, and the board said "too little is known about the characteristics of 
such rotors to conclude decisively whether they were factors in this accident." 
</P>
<P>
 The other possibility cited by the board was a malfunction of the systems that 
move the plane's rudder -- the large, hinged slab on the vertical part of the 
tail that helps a plane turn left or right by pushing the tail in the opposite 
direction. Full deflection of the rudder could cause a plane to roll and then 
plunge nose-first toward the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are difficulties with this scenario too. The board conceded that 
although it had identified problems with the 737's rudder systems, there were 
no problems that could not "easily" have been countered by the cockpit crew. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 Boeing 737s are flying throughout the world today, carrying 
more passengers than any other aircraft, so the NTSB's lack of a firm 
conclusion about what went wrong in Colorado Springs is of more than casual 
interest to the aviation industry. 
</P>
<P>
 It also worries pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lesson to be learned from every crash, and when you don't find out 
what happened, you haven't learned that lesson," Schiff said. "As a pilot, you 
think: 'Gee, that could happen to me.' It's kind of spooky." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Lauber said air travelers should not be overly concerned about 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the attention focused on the plane and its systems after Colorado 
Springs, the public should be reassured," he said. The (Boeing 737) was 
examined with great diligence and effort. . . . It's a good plane." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots of Flight 427 apparently had no problems with their Boeing 737 as 
the plane took off from Chicago on the evening of Sept. 8 and headed southeast 
for Pittsburgh on the first leg of a scheduled trip to West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather was good, with calm winds, and the jetliner was making a routine 
approach to Pittsburgh International Airport when one of the pilots, during a 
conversation with air traffic controllers, suddenly shouted, "Oh God!" 
</P>
<P>
 At that same moment, the plane rolled to the left and plummeted straight down, 
slamming into the ground with such force that the aircraft and its contents 
were torn to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few hours, an NTSB team had reached Pittsburgh, and by the next 
morning the investigators made their first visit to the crash site -- a shallow 
hillside gully near the town of Aliquippa. Joining them there were specialists 
from the airline, the pilots' union and other parties with close interest in 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The personnel were divided into subgroups. One group began studying the 
plane's engines, another looked at its control systems, a third studied the 
meteorology, a fourth interviewed witnesses, a fifth talked with air traffic 
controllers, a sixth analyzed the wreckage to determine how the plane broke up, 
and others reviewed maintenance records and the history of the crew, the 
airline and the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 As they pursued their tasks, heavy rains pounded the hillside, slowing the 
gruesome job of extracting the fragmented remains of the victims from the 
shattered debris. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, the investigators gathered at a local hotel to discuss their early 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leader of each group gets up and says: 'Today we found this,' " Vogt 
said. "That way, everyone knows what everyone else knows." 
</P>
<P>
 "One person will come up with a scenario, and another person will try to shoot 
it down," said a source close to the investigation who asked not to be named. 
"It's a process of elimination. If you can shoot one down, then there's one 
less avenue that you have to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how a scenario involving sudden failure of the left engine -- which 
could have rolled the plane to the left -- was ruled out. The recovered 
engine's fan blades were bent, and dirt had been sucked into an inner turbine, 
showing that it was still spinning, under power, when the plane hit the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Inappropriate deployment of an engine thrust reverser was discounted in much 
the same way when actuators on the left engine's reversers -- the only ones 
that could have rolled the plane to the left -- were found in the stowed 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather problems were ruled out, as were in-flight breakup and the likelihood 
of a bomb, which leaves tell-tale residue and characteristic metal distortions 
near the point of explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the investigation's second day, Flight 427's two black box 
recording devices -- which actually are painted orange -- had been recovered 
from the wreckage and shipped to the NTSB laboratories in Washington. Word came 
back quickly that both had survived the impact in good shape and were providing 
clear data. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the boxes -- the cockpit voice recorder -- contained a tape recording 
of all the sounds in the cockpit during the last 30 minutes of the flight. In 
addition to the discussions and remarks of the pilot and co-pilot, the device 
recorded their conversations with air traffic controllers and a number of 
clicks, hums, thumps and other noises that can provide clues to what was going 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in the investigation of a 1987 Continental Airlines jetliner 
crash in Denver, engineers determined the takeoff speed by analyzing the sound 
of the spinning nose wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 The voices picked up by the cockpit recorder are often faint, garbled or 
distorted, requiring painstaking electronic enhancement by NTSB engineers. 
Listening to the desperate last moments of someone about to die "is not a job 
for everyone," said Alan Pollock, an NTSB spokesman. "You often hear things 
that are pretty unpleasant." 
</P>
<P>
 The other box -- the flight data recorder -- collected 17 different types of 
information about the plane's performance during the final minutes of flight. 
The data included readouts on the plane's altitude, heading, airspeed, engine 
performance, pitch, roll and acceleration, both vertical and horizontal. While 
the recorder also contained information on the position of the control yoke, it 
lacked data -- available on newer recorders -- about other control settings. 
</P>
<P>
 The readings from the flight data recorder have been programmed into a 737 
cockpit flight simulator at the Boeing Co. plant in Seattle, creating a 
full-scale replication of how the USAir jet behaved during its last moments of 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers are now feeding in every combination of control failure, autopilot 
malfunction, weather phenomenon, engine failure and pilot error that they can 
think of in an effort to match the replication generated by the recording. 
</P>
<P>
 If they can come up with a match, it would provide strong evidence of what 
went wrong. Thus far, they haven't, but they're still trying. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, there are a number of theories," another informed source said. "Most 
of these center around the possibility that the plane encountered severe wake 
turbulence from another plane, or that something went wrong with the flight 
controls -- perhaps the rudder. Maybe it was some combination of the two. Maybe 
the pilot just didn't have time to react properly." 
</P>
<P>
 The scenario involving wake turbulence -- cyclonic winds that spiral back from 
the wingtips of large aircraft -- arose after investigators learned that the 
USAir jetliner was flying below and four miles behind a Boeing 727 as the two 
planes approached the Pittsburgh airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, there's a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon has caused smaller planes to crash -- most recently a small 
corporate jet that was trailing a Boeing 757 as the two planes approached John 
Wayne Airport in Orange County last December. But planes the size of a 737 
routinely fly behind other jetliners, and wake turbulence has never been known 
to down any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 One source said that for wake turbulence to flip over a 737, the 737 probably 
would have to encounter the spiraling vortex at a very precise angle that would 
raise one wing and lower the other -- "a very long shot," as he put it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But wake turbulence could be a factor," Vogt said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for rudder system failure, the NTSB noted that after the Colorado Springs 
crash, regular inspections of 737 rudder systems were mandated by the FAA. The 
rudder on the plane in the Pittsburgh accident had been checked four times this 
year -- most recently less than a month before the crash -- and no problems 
were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are scrutinizing the rudder components recovered from the 
wreckage. Thus far, no incriminating evidence has been found, but the 
suspicions continue and study goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 The wreckage of the plane -- some of it in pieces no larger than a dime -- has 
been spread out like a mosaic on the floor of a hangar in Pittsburgh to form a 
two-dimensional reconstruction of the jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
 "They recovered 97% to 99% of that plane," a source said. "They're looking for 
anything abnormal." 
</P>
<P>
 H. Keith Hagy, an accident investigator with the Air Line Pilots Assn., said 
the evidence sometimes is minuscule, such as tiny hairline cracks visible only 
under a microscope, that are left "like rings in a tree" every time a thin 
piece of metal is bent. 
</P>
<P>
 Cracks like these suggest that a part may have failed from metal fatigue 
before the plane crashed, Hagy said, while evidence of stretching or tearing 
indicate that the part failed on impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Other, larger cracks may indicate that an entire fuselage is about to burst 
open under the repeated stress of cabin pressurization. That's what happened to 
an Aloha Airlines jet a few years ago in Hawaii, when a section of the fuselage 
popped off, leaving passengers riding in the open at 300 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the bodies of the victims can provide clues to why the crash occurred. If 
an autopsy shows a man was killed on impact but there is soot in his lungs, 
that indicates there was a fire on board before the plane crashed, while the 
victim was still breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some evidence may not turn up until months after a crash -- like the flawed 
engine shaft from a DC-10 that an Iowa farmer unearthed while plowing. Some -- 
like the ice that doomed the Continental Airlines jet in Denver in 1987 -- 
melted away in the morning sun. 
</P>
<P>
 And some may turn out to point in the wrong direction. After an American 
Airlines DC-10 crashed in Chicago in 1979 when an engine fell off, NTSB Vice 
Chairman Elwood Driver announced that investigators had found a missing bolt on 
the airfield grass that was thought to be the culprit. It wasn't.

ARISTIDE MOBBED BY ADMIRERS, TAKES REFUGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON and KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
 Proof that Haiti remains extremely volatile was in evidence Monday as friendly 
but unruly crowds mobbed the car carrying President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and 
then hurled stones and insults at Haiti's senior military officer, whose family 
home was torched. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide, making only his second public appearance since being restored to 
power Saturday, was forced to beat a hasty retreat when his motorcade ventured 
out of the gates of the Presidential Palace and into a gathering of thousands 
of people desperate to catch a glimpse of their leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Mob violence, meanwhile, continued to take its toll, the hunting down of 
suspected pro-military gunmen seemed to be on the rise, and new political 
killings were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing tension and potential for violence and revenge pose a 
formidable challenge to Aristide's new government even as it prepares to resume 
work after three years of brutal military rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of electricity in the air," an international observer said. 
"And the temptation is great to take things in your own hands, especially when 
there is a vacuum of law and order." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling again for peace and reconciliation, Aristide attended a brief ceremony 
Monday morning at the Presidential Palace commemorating the anniversary of the 
1806 assassination of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who led Haiti's bloody battle 
for independence from France. After Aristide's motorcade was forced into 
retreat, it later left through a back entrance to allow the president to lay a 
wreath at the National Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in attendance was Maj. Gen. Jean-Claude Duperval, the interim head of the 
Haitian army following the forced retirement last week of strongman Lt. Gen. 
Raoul Cedras. Where Aristide was cheered, Duperval was buffeted with cries of 
"Thieves!" "Assassins!" His car was pummeled with stones. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitians were still angry and unsettled over rumors Sunday night that Duperval 
was part of a plot to kill Aristide. The rumors began after U.S. troops 
disarmed Duperval when he reached the palace Sunday for a meeting, and later 
found grenade launchers in his car. 
</P>
<P>
 Roaming through downtown Port-au-Prince on Sunday night, crowds brandishing 
machetes set up impromptu roadblocks, ostensibly to search for weapons, and 
dispersed only after U.S. troops using megaphones repeated messages that 
Aristide was not harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gonaives, 100 miles north of Port-au-Prince, angry crowds burned to the 
ground the home belonging to Duperval's mother and several adjoining 
properties, U.S. officials said. Radio reports said another home belonging to 
the grandmother of former junta leader Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois was 
burned and a grain depot owned by one of Haiti's richest families was looted. 
</P>
<P>
 The intervention by American GIs to stop mob violence has become routine. They 
are frequently called upon to rescue men who are chased and captured by groups 
searching for attaches -- the paramilitary agents who supported the now-dead 
military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a group on Monday cornered a merchant named Guy Barosi after chasing him 
down John Brown Boulevard, a principal thoroughfare. The crowd said he had 
guns; Barosi said he was being targeted only because he had accused street 
people of stealing his car battery. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are guns inside!" members of the crowd shouted as they surged outside 
Barosi's photography shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have done nothing! They are trying to kill me!" shouted Barosi. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd cheered when American military police in armored personnel carriers 
arrived. The police treated cuts to Barosi's hand while international police 
monitors searched his home for guns. None were found, and the crowd was 
persuaded to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking for attaches wherever we think they might be," said Haitian 
Lissage Casseur, who seemed to be a leader in the group. "Last night, we took 
one in Carrefour Peillant (a slum). He had an Uzi and other guns. We gave him 
to the GIs. But he fought us, so we had to wound him in the head." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, members of the crowd argued with the GIs, saying that if they 
did not disarm backers of the former military regime, the crowd would have to 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disarmament," shouted one man, "and then reconciliation!" 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign that political killings are continuing, two people were hacked to 
death in the sprawling Port-au-Prince slum of Cite Soleil on Sunday night. 
There were conflicting reports on the circumstances: Members of Aristide's 
transition team said the victims were Aristide supporters, while witnesses told 
reporters one of the dead was a member of FRAPH -- the Front for the 
Advancement and Progress of Haiti, a paramilitary squad. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials contended that the violence is actually decreasing but is to be 
expected to continue in a country with a 200-year history of murder and 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are taking snapshots . . . of isolated incidents," U.S. Embassy spokesman 
Stanley Schrager told reporters. "For those of you here one week, or two weeks 
or four weeks, there has been since Sept. 19th a lower level of violence than 
before. . . . We think it will continue to be reduced as the military is 
professionalized and a new police force is established." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, U.S. officials outlined a $200-million multilateral aid program 
for Haiti over the next five months. It will include humanitarian aid and 
support for democratic institutions and infrastructure.

ISRAEL, JORDAN OK DRAFT PEACE TREATY; MIDEAST: PRELIMINARY ACCORD SETTLES 
BORDER DISPUTES, PROVIDES FOR TWO NATIONS TO SHARE WATER. IT MARKS THE JEWISH 
STATE'S SECOND SUCH PACT WITH AN ARAB NEIGHBOR. 
</P>

<P>
 Israel and Jordan, accelerating the search for peace in the Middle East, 
agreed Monday on a draft treaty that settles their border disputes, shares 
scarce water resources and ensures the security of both. 
</P>
<P>
 When the treaty is signed next week and ratified, Israel will be at peace with 
two of its Arab neighbors, Jordan and Egypt, and strongly pursuing negotiations 
with Syria and the Palestinians in a sustained effort to bring the Arab-Israeli 
conflict to an end within the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am full of hope that the future will be a future of peace, that this step 
will be a very important one (for) a comprehensive peace in this region," King 
Hussein of Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it is a fresh beginning and a fresh start," he continued, alluding 
to the long refusal of the Arabs to accept the Jewish state -- and the many 
wars that have resulted. "We will guard (this peace), and I hope that the 
generations beyond us will guard it, enjoy it and cherish it -- a peace with 
dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and Jordan will establish full diplomatic relations by the end of the 
year; tourists and business people from both countries will be able to travel 
back and forth, and Jordan will halt its participation in the Arab boycott of 
Israel to permit full trade with the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who initialed Monday's accord along with 
Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali of Jordan, called the agreement a 
"historically unique moment" and praised Hussein's "courageous decision" in 
deciding to accelerate the negotiations, not waiting for Syria to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty will be "a cornerstone for a new Middle East in which peace, 
development and cooperation will replace animosity, hatred, violence and wars," 
said Rabin, who like the king was glowing with pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very important day for our countries and our peoples, but I believe 
also that it is a source of inspiration, an example that peace is attainable." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement renewed optimism in the region about prospects for peace after 
two murderous attacks within Israel by Islamic militants last week. In 
retaliation, Israel suspended talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization 
on broadening the Palestinian Authority and holding elections in the Gaza Strip 
and West Bank, raising serious questions about the course of the peacemaking 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton said he was "delighted" with the agreement 
and announced that he will accept a Jordanian-Israeli invitation to witness the 
formal signing of the treaty, expected Oct. 26 at a spot along the two nations' 
desert frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a time when hatred and extremism and threatening behavior still stalk the 
Middle East," Clinton said, "this agreement reminds us that moderation and 
reason are prevailing, that nations can put conflicts behind them, that 
courageous statesmen can lead their people to peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he hoped that Israel's agreement with Jordan will ease the far 
more difficult negotiations with Syria. "We are continuing to work there and we 
are encouraged," he said of the ongoing U.S. mediation. "We just have to keep 
working." 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials said Clinton will probably also visit U.S. troops in Kuwait or 
Saudi Arabia. The President may also meet with Syrian President Hafez Assad to 
promote peace between Syria and Israel, they said, although the scheduling and 
location of such a meeting has not been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton will be the first U.S. President to visit Israel since Jimmy Carter in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, Israeli President Ezer Weizman said Assad "should look around 
and see (whether) he may be the last in line" to make peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 But Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh tartly reminded Israel from 
Damascus: "We hope the Israeli government will realize the fact that without 
achieving peace with Syria and Lebanon, there will be no peace in the region. . 
. . This is the reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Israel and Jordan signed a nonbelligerency pact in Washington on July 
25 and have been working since then to resolve differences standing in the way 
of a full peace treaty, there were fears among Israelis that Hussein, who had 
not wanted to get too far ahead of Assad, would hold up a final agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are two countries that have large shared areas and a long history of 
cooperation rather than opposition," said Asher Susser, a political scientist 
at Tel Aviv University and a leading Israeli specialist on Jordan. "The treaty 
reflects that, historically, Israel's relations with Jordan have always been 
better than with the other Arabs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The treaty consequently has been more a measure of summing these up and 
giving them formal shape than an arduous negotiation. It was always more a 
question of timing than of the actual compromises involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin had come to Amman on Sunday evening determined to make as much progress 
as possible on the draft treaty. He negotiated with Hussein until 3 a.m., slept 
a few hours in the royal palace and then resumed talks with the king. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sat together throughout the night, and the atmosphere remained 
exceptional," Shimon Sheves, a senior Rabin aide, said. "The prime minister and 
the king went through the draft . . . paragraph by paragraph." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordanian Prime Minister Majali and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres held 
parallel talks, and the full negotiating teams broke into small groups, worked 
through the night and then reviewed the 15-page treaty with Hussein and Rabin 
on Monday morning after breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxious to build momentum in the peace process as a whole, Rabin had already 
paid two visits here last week and, in an extraordinary move, assigned Ephraim 
Halevi, the deputy chief of Israeli intelligence, to conduct almost continuous 
negotiations in Amman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabin was worried, and maybe the king was as well, that the issues might be 
talked to death, the negotiations slowed and our whole push for peace 
dissipated," a senior Israeli official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement with Jordan will put some pressure on Syria and the 
Palestinians to keep pace or be left behind. The connection is not so direct, 
but it is real." 
</P>
<P>
 Susser said that Syria lost its veto power over Jordan and the Palestinians 
last year in peace negotiations, freeing both to make their own deals. Syria 
consequently finds itself under pressure, he added, to move ahead and ensure 
that its interests are not ignored as a new regional balance of power takes 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the draft agreement, Israel will give back to Jordan farming land in two 
areas that was seized in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War -- and then lease it for a 
period of 25 years and possibly longer. One area lies between the Sea of 
Galilee and Beit Shean in the Jordan Valley, and the other is near Zofar 
between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
 Other land disputes were settled by an agreement to exchange small pieces of 
territory and establish a proper border -- not just an armistice or cease-fire 
line -- between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 No Israeli community will be uprooted by the agreement, Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharing of limited regional water resources was resolved with an agreement 
that Jordan can build a dam on the Yarmuk River before it feeds into the Jordan 
River, with plans for a second one later, both with World Bank financing. 
Israel also promised to take Jordan's needs into consideration when releasing 
water from the Sea of Galilee into the Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan claimed Israel was diverting more than its fair share of regional river 
waters, but Israel said the solution was to enlarge the waters available. "We 
got all our rights and even more than what we dreamed of," Jordan's chief water 
negotiator, Munther Hadadin, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement won quick approval in Israel, even from the right-wing 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we all want is real peace," Benjamin Netanyahu, chairman of the Likud 
Party, said. "The argument between me and Yitzhak Rabin is not over Jordan, 
because there we have an entity that wants to live with us, not replace us. The 
real argument is over the PLO, which wants to replace us in stages." 
</P>
<P>
 There were clear misgivings among Palestinians, who fear that Jordan is trying 
to supplant the PLO in negotiations with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the triangular relations among us, the Jordanians and the 
Israelis, I believe there are common things, like water resources, that we must 
consider together," said Faisal Husseini, a minister in the Palestinian 
Authority. "Talking about water without having an agreement with the 
Palestinians is not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians will also be irritated by the way that the draft treaty reaffirms 
Israel's respect for Jordan's traditional role as the guardian of Islamic holy 
places in Jerusalem and thus puts Jordan into negotiations on the city's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty will make Jordan the second Arab country formally at peace with 
Israel. Egypt, in 1979 the first to make peace, was ostracized for more than a 
decade, and President Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by Islamic militants 
angered by that treaty.

 Israel and Jordan have reconciled their differences, paving the way for a 
peace treaty between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 What was agreed on: 
</P>
<P>
 * Israel will give some of the land it captured in 1948 back to Jordan but 
will lease areas that have Israeli settlements or farms.

NEW PRISONS NO PANACEA FOR ILLS OF RURAL CALIFORNIA; CORRECTIONS: THEY BRING 
JOBS, BUT ALSO MORE DEMAND FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICES. STILL, MANY PLACES WANT

<P>
 They really liked the first one here, a minimum-security state prison that 
housed about 1,600 inmates soon after it was built in 1963, a low-slung 
facility that resembled a boarding school and brought high-paying jobs to a 
remote town reeling from a downturn in the lumber industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But some began to have misgivings when the California Correctional Center more 
than doubled in size with the 1987 addition of a higher-security complex to 
house a nastier breed of felon -- more than 2,000 rapists, kidnapers and other 
violent offenders, held behind razor wire in two-man cells with rifles trained 
upon them 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a new Susanville prison races toward completion -- a high-tech, 
maximum-security facility ringed with an electrified fence to thwart escapes. 
At capacity, the new facility will bring the city's inmate population close to 
10,000. When this second prison opens next August, more people will be living 
behind bars than outside them in this eastern Sierra ranching town. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the Honey Lake Valley, not everyone is pleased. Even without a second 
prison, money is so tight that in 1991 the Board of Supervisors asked the state 
Legislature to dissolve rural Lassen County. At the time, consideration was 
given to becoming part of Nevada; most county officials keep tiny Nevada flags 
-- navy-and-gold reminders of grim times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The original prison probably took us out of a subsistence-type existence," 
says Lyle Lough, a longtime resident and Lassen County supervisor whose 
district includes the prisons. "The second prison will probably push a lot of 
us back to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1984, California has built 16 new prisons largely in rural communities 
throughout the state, hardscrabble towns with crippled economies searching for 
a way to bankroll libraries, woo Wal-Marts, pay for police. With the state's 
"three strikes" legislation signed in March, up to 25 more state prisons will 
be built by the year 2000, facilities that cost about $200 million to construct 
and promise between 800 and 1,200 permanent jobs on completion. 
</P>
<P>
 While locating a prison is a delicate operation, the state Department of 
Corrections has no lack of suitors. And the short list for new prison 
construction shows several main trends for the state. Of the seven likely sites 
picked so far, three are in Central California; four are in rural areas; five 
have some sort of correctional facility already and want another one. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would a city pray for even one prison, a development often considered a 
LULU -- or Locally Unwanted Land Use? "Jobs. It's a one-word answer," says Mary 
Scarpa, mayor pro tem of always-a-bridesmaid Adelanto, a Southern California 
city that has courted a correctional facility for 15 years to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Susanville could teach Adelanto, prisons are no panacea for the ills 
of rural California. Along with jobs they bring stress: potential impacts on 
schools and roads, courts and cops, property values and public pride. They 
bring money, but they cost money too. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter of all cities that now contain a state prison have a median family 
income below the national poverty line. This grim statistic says two things: 
Like Adelanto, it is often the poorest of cities that want a prison. And, as 
Susanville can testify, having a state prison does not in itself guarantee a 
leg up from poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, since the mid-1980s, when money began to tighten and rural America 
suffered an exodus of jobs and residents, community opposition to prisons has 
dropped dramatically. In 1984, 23 U.S. correctional departments reported local 
opposition to prison construction, according to a 1988 national study; four 
years later, that number had dropped to five, and 24 reported only community 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, says Ernie Van Sant, chief of the California Corrections 
Department's construction support branch, is entirely economic. "California 
towns see a prison as improving their economy or offsetting other losses," he 
says. "We're not an industrial developer. We don't use a lot of chemicals. 
We're somewhat recession-proof." 
</P>
<P>
 And most studies show that, while prisons have a strong emotional impact on a 
community, they do not do the two things that most residents fear: raise crime 
rates and lower property values. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1985 report by the California Senate Office of Research matched seven prison 
cities with 15 non-prison cities that had similar demographics. It concluded 
that "crime rates tend to be lower in those cities affiliated with a prison 
than in similar cities. . . . In 11 of the 15 cities that matched prison 
cities, property values actually increased at a slower rate than in those 
cities with prisons." 
</P>
<P>
 A study for the National Institute of Corrections, which likened siting 
prisons in modern times to finding homes for leper colonies in earlier eras, 
looked at seven correctional centers across the country. It found "positive 
effects on the local economy and no negative effects on property values, public 
safety and the quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the economic benefits of a prison on a community, the bare 
figures are impressive: A medium-maximum security prison costs more than $280 
million to build, creating more than 900 temporary construction jobs in the 
process, according to the state Corrections Department. 
</P>
<P>
 If a prison is filled to its euphemistic "design capacity" -- the number of 
inmates actually intended for the facility rather than the overblown number 
usually housed there -- it creates 800 permanent jobs. If a prison is filled to 
the more common level of about 200%, that number jumps to 1,200 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, once a prison is constructed, it generates 400 to 600 jobs in the 
community beyond those created through building and staffing the facility, 
according to the Corrections Department. Most of those jobs are typically in 
the food service and retail industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Susanville officials generally agree with the state's estimates, but they say 
the jobs at the prison itself are the biggest boon to their city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where else in Susanville are you going to make $3,000 a month with a high 
school diploma?" asks Dave Foster, chairman of the mathematics and science 
department at Lassen College and a former Susanville mayor. "It's allowed a lot 
of Susanville kids to stay here. This is our industry. Maybe that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 These jobs pay good money, an average of $41,000 a year, according to 
corrections officials. You probably could not buy a house on that kind of 
salary in Los Angeles County. But in Southern California's High Desert, you can 
live comfortably on such an income. 
</P>
<P>
 "It creates an economy," says Scarpa, mayor pro tem of Adelanto, which is 
still lobbying for a state prison after years of rejection. "The desert always 
has been notorious for not making jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Scarpa's gritty city is No. 1 in the state if you're going by alphabetical 
order; it is No. 456 out of 466 if you're looking at median family income. That 
income figure in Adelanto was $18,405 in 1989, the most recent year for which 
statistics were available; the national poverty level for a family of four is 
$4,500 less. 
</P>
<P>
 Adelanto, locals are fond of saying, is the little town that would: It would 
take just about any industry that would locate within its 52 dusty square 
miles, a place where Joshua trees outnumber people, where Soldier of Fortune is 
easier to find than Time magazine, where the only land use residents opposed in 
recent years was a shelter for the mentally ill homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarpa is proud to list the businesses for which Adelanto was perhaps the only 
suitor: There's the Intermountain Power Project, a thicket of high-power lines 
that helps to light the San Fernando Valley. The Hi-Desert Casino came in 20 
years ago, long before the statewide rush to gaming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people don't want big trucking industries," Scarpa says. "They tear up 
the roads and create air pollution. We have three to four large trucking 
industries which we're very proud of and are good neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 The city emblem shows a "hypersonic" jet and a high-speed train, two projects 
that bring a gleam to city officials' eyes; the city slogan prematurely boasts 
"High Desert International Adelanto, CA." But the proposed international 
airport, designed for jets faster than the Concorde, is on the back burner; a 
300-m.p.h. super-speed train to link Anaheim and Las Vegas has suffered the 
same fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Adelanto does have a contract prison, one of seven such facilities statewide. 
Although it houses 428 short-term felons for drug rehabilitation, it is run by 
the city and is a far cry from the cash cow that a full-scale state prison is. 
</P>
<P>
 On the good side, its inmates cannot have committed violent crimes. Says 
Warden Buford Lee Cribb of his handpicked charges, who are mostly in for 
committing crimes to support drug habits: "The (guard) captain refers to them 
as the cream of the crap." 
</P>
<P>
 On the bad side, the facility has 10% of the staff of a full state prison, and 
the salaries earned by its city employees "are not comparable to state 
salaries," Cribb says. "And probably only 10% of our staff live in Adelanto. I 
live in Hesperia." So it is nice, this squeaky-clean, 3-year-old facility, but 
not nearly enough for little Adelanto, which continues to lobby the Corrections 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But would a full-scale state prison solve these problems? Hanford real estate 
developer Walt Miller, who hoped to profit from new prison construction by 
building apartments for guard and inmate families, would probably say no. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Corrections Department projections, Miller built 185 apartments in 
Corcoran, 150 in Avenal and 280 in Crescent City -- about 10% of what the state 
predicted the prison-fueled housing needs there would be. However, few renters 
moved in, and Miller ended up going bankrupt in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of them worked out," said Dwight Long, who was hired by Miller to handle 
his bankruptcy reorganization. Entrepreneurs and town leaders anticipated an 
economic bonanza from the prisons, Long said, but those hopes turned out to be 
"unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all prayers of prison prosperity are as unrealistic as those encountered 
by Miller. Back in the 1950s, the Lassen County town of Westwood just east of 
Susanville was home to one of the biggest sawmills in the world, located in the 
heart of the prime growing zone for Ponderosa pine. It was a century after the 
area's brief gold rush, and lumbering was a mainstay of Lassen County. Then, in 
1955, the sawmill closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole area was in an economic decline," recalls Fred Money, tax man, 
realtor and current vice president of the Lassen County Board of Realtors, a 
Susanville old-timer who moved here in 1958. The prison, he recalls, was a 
"political gift" when it opened in 1963. "They wanted anything to boost the 
economy in those days." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the 1970s, when a drop in the number of inmates nearly closed the 
Susanville prison. To this day, 20-year-old newspaper clippings hang in the 
correctional center's lobby chronicling the region's battle to "Save Our 
Center": "Susanville -- The Only City in California That Wants Its Prison." And 
finally, "Joy Comes to Susanville: Prison Employing 270 Will Stay Open." 
</P>
<P>
 The prison grew in 1987, with an expansion that largely proved unpopular 
because it raised security at the facility from so-called Level I-II to Level 
III to cope with the heightened violence of its new inmates. The higher the 
prison's security level, the more staffing is necessary, the greater impact on 
a community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care how many people say it didn't happen; you began to see outside 
influences," insists Lough of the Board of Supervisors. "There's an increase in 
stress in the communities. There's an increase in inmate families." 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, with a backdrop of increasing controversy, the Susanville 
City Council and the Lassen County Board of Supervisors approved the addition 
of another Level I-II prison to the city. But the bond measure to pay for it 
was voted down and the idea languished. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1992, says the Corrections Department's Van Sant, a selected group of 
Lassen County citizens approached the department again about building the 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 After a divisive campaign that turned friends and family members against each 
other, the voters of Lassen County approved a prison -- a Level I-II facility 
as described in the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing we know, they were building a Level III-IV prison here," Lough 
says, without doing a new environmental report. "We felt betrayed." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Sant calls the turn of events "not a shining example" of Corrections 
Department behavior. "It would have been nicer to have a resolution from the 
city and the Board of Supervisors . . . to help not get bruised feelings that 
the state unilaterally did that to them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The bruised feelings, however, remain. Jay Dow, a Lassen County rancher and 
member of a local school board, is still bitter about the prison under 
construction today. "I'm not critical of our current prison," he says. "It's 
the way the (Corrections Department) comes in to site prisons. They're a P.R. 
firm and they act like it, and it appalled me." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the prison has yet to be completed, its effects are already being 
felt. The Shaffer Union School District grew by the equivalent of 31 students 
last year when construction started. That would not be much for the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, but when you have one school and 460 students, the 
impact is unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
 A 160-unit mobile home park is scheduled to open in one corner of the Shaffer 
district in April, four months before the prison, adding nearly 120 students at 
conservative estimates. A 200-unit housing tract is planned in the next year or 
two; that's about 150 more students. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has agreed to give the county's schools $1.98 million in onetime 
mitigation fees -- the first county ever to receive such assistance. But it 
costs $4 million to build a single school. The $1.98 million would not even 
reach the 50% level required for the state to pitch in matching funds for that 
solitary campus, and there are six school districts in Lassen County, all 
feeling some impact. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dave Urbanac came to Lassen County in 1986 as superintendent-principal of 
tiny Johnstonville School District, his one-school operation had 185 students. 
Today, there are 260. During his tenure, average class size has grown from 22 
to about 27. 
</P>
<P>
 About 225 new housing units are planned for his district as a direct result of 
the new prison. Urbanac is trying to negotiate developers' fees to be tacked 
onto the unbuilt homes to help offset the cost of a new school. With that 
money, about $800,000 if the developers agree, he still won't have enough to 
build a new campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime we've had money left over at the end of the year, we've been setting 
it aside for future building," Urbanac says. "It's been earmarked for the kids, 
but it will probably go to building." 
</P>
<P>
 Classroom space aside, the prisons have other impacts on school districts. On 
the one hand, work crews from the existing low-medium security Susanville 
facility spend summers cleaning up the county's schools. On the other, the 
children of inmates -- and both Johnstonville and Shaffer have them in class -- 
challenge the districts' abilities in more ways than just classroom space. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Shaffer's 460 charges, 76 have one or more parents working at the prison 
and 38 have a father or stepfather behind bars there, says Donald J. Carter, 
Shaffer's superintendent-principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students (of inmate families) are all very high-risk," Carter says. "They 
come from single-parent homes. They're latchkey kids, often on (Aid to Families 
With Dependent Children). . . . It's very obvious they're from a whole 
different area. It creates societal conflicts. The child does not fit in." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the schools, Lassen County has received a onetime payment of $1.98 
million from the state to compensate for the prison under construction. It also 
receives a small amount of money each year based on the inmate population. But 
county officials contend that the money comes nowhere near fixing what ails the 
rural area. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, unlike private industry, government operations pay no property 
tax -- the money that counties thrive on to supply services such as health care 
and police protection. Half of the people employed in Lassen County already 
work for government agencies; when the new prison is built, that will rise to 
more than 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 And county services are already strapped: The district attorney's office -- a 
place with 1 1/2 lawyer positions -- is operating at 130% capacity. Although 
the county's population has doubled since the 1970s, the Sheriff's Department 
has about the same staffing as it did two decades ago. In the past five years, 
the county has lost 45 employees; those that remain just received a 5% pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've given up trying to decide why we're broke," says a frustrated William D. 
Bixby, county administrative officer. "I know we're broke. There's no sense in 
analyzing it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are those in Susanville who believe that job growth is important, 
that the costs can be absorbed, that the benefits are tangible. They ask, what 
else is Susanville going to do? 
</P>
<P>
 Says Lino P. Callegari, a City Council member and former mayor: "There's going 
to be some adversity. But . . . we're sustaining a sound work force in Lassen 
County." About This Series

 Prison building already has become a multibillion-dollar industry in 
California, and with the "three strikes" law, an even bigger boom is forecast 
for the coming decades. The Times visited prisons, from the Imperial Valley to 
the North Coast, and reviewed thousands of pages of public records to examine 
the state's prisons construction program, life inside the penitentiaries and 
issues that already are severely straining the penal system.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; DISCLOSURE OF RAPE COULD BE A 
KEY MOMENT; IMPACT OF BROWN'S REVELATION ABOUT HER DAUGHTER REMAINS UNCERTAIN, 
ANALYSTS SAY. CANDIDATE'S CAMPAIGN PROVIDES AN ACCOUNT THAT SEEMS AT ODDS WITH 
WHAT WAS SAID DURING THE DEBATE.

<P>
 Whether or not Kathleen Brown overcomes the odds to beat Gov. Pete Wilson next 
month, her revelation on statewide television that one of her daughters had 
been raped may go down as one of the defining moments in the Wilson-Brown 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days since the debate, the disclosure -- which occurred midway through 
last Friday's debate and which Brown has since refused to discuss in detail -- 
has been repeatedly broadcast on television as political analysts have weighed 
both its motives and its impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Was the disclosure spontaneous or calculated? Did it help Brown connect with 
the women voters whose enthusiasm she needs to fuel? Or did it exploit Brown's 
daughter's personal tragedy, distracting attention from more relevant issues? 
And what of Wilson, who seemed to dismiss the emotional moment as theater? 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, fresh questions were raised when the Brown campaign provided an 
account that seemed at odds with what the candidate said during the debate. 
Both campaigns claimed that they had benefited from Friday's faceoff. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, Brown's decision to reveal the attack on her daughter 
suggested that she truly wants to be governor -- not a small thing, analysts 
said, for a woman whose reasons for seeking the office have at times seemed 
little more than familial. But it also seemed to show that she might do 
anything to win -- even expose her the private pain of her 25-year-old 
daughter, Sascha Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange occurred halfway through the hour-long debate. Brown turned to 
the Republican incumbent known for his sympathy for crime victims and, in a 
fierce voice, told him not to question her commitment on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot imagine what it's like to be a mother waiting at home late at 
night for your kids to come home, waiting for your daughter to come home in the 
evening and having her come home and comfort her, because she's been raped," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or your son called to come home from school while I'm working to say, 'Come 
home, because I've been robbed' . . . You can't understand that. So don't 
question my commitment to be tough on crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, caught off guard, appeared unsympathetic, deriding Brown's comments as 
"a moving performance." At a subsequent news conference, Brown said the 
incident, a date rape, had occurred years before. She said there were no police 
reports made and no arrests. She said her son Zeb was mugged in the late 1980s 
in New York City. None of Brown's three children could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign, which since Friday has maintained that the disclosure was 
not planned, Monday provided new details about the events that led up to it. 
Steve Glazer, a spokesman for the Brown campaign, said that before the debate 
Brown had talked to Sascha Rice on three separate occasions about the 
possibility of making her private life public. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Brown declared her candidacy, she discussed with her whole family "how 
in a high-profile race such as this one, your life can become an open book," 
Glazer said. Then, last summer, Brown had "a personal discussion with Sascha 
where they discussed the rape. It was in the context of 'this is one of a 
number of things that people may ask me about and I might talk about.' " Glazer 
said Rice "indicated that she understood that it might come out and that she 
was accepting of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, just a few days before the debate, mother and daughter had a third 
conversation, Glazer said. "They again discussed this event and . . . that 
(Brown) might want to talk about it some time in the course of the campaign," 
he said. Again, Glazer said, Rice said she was comfortable with Brown making 
the incident public. 
</P>
<P>
 This chronology, however, seems to belie the campaign's claim that Brown's 
remarks were spontaneous. Immediately after the debate, Clint Reilly, Brown's 
campaign chairman, said the rape "was not something I even knew about." He said 
that "unequivocally. . . this was not something that was prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts who watched the debate don't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly it just didn't pop into her head in the middle of the debate. Whether 
or not it was plotted for months by her consultants, that didn't come out of 
nowhere," said Darry Sragow, who managed Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi's unsuccessful campaign for governor. "When you're in the situation 
she's in, you have to throw a long pass. She threw a long pass. And every once 
in a while you throw the long pass and you get a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia, 
agreed and lamented that politics has been reduced to the level of television 
talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone with a grain of sense could see that was a practiced ploy that didn't 
spring from her mind in a moment of angst. That was something her consultants 
dreamed up," he said, "Of course it says nothing. But TV talk shows have taught 
us not to be concerned about facts. . . . One doesn't recite statistics on 
Oprah or Phil. You recount tear-jerking emotional incidents that are incredibly 
private." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's campaign, Sabato speculated, "was hoping to make an emotional 
connection with voters and particularly women where she's been falling." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, meanwhile, was technically correct in calling Brown's outburst a 
performance, Sabato said. "But he did exactly the wrong thing in appearing to 
be callous and cruel. The smart thing to do would be (to say), 'OK, it's a 
ploy, but I'm going to match her and raise her and express sympathy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign's account Monday of when Brown learned about her daughter's 
rape appeared to contradict Brown. In the debate, Brown made it sound as if she 
learned of the incident while comforting her daughter on the night that it 
happened. But according to John Whitehurst, Brown's press secretary, Brown's 
daughter was raped while she was a teen-ager and did not tell her mother until 
several years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst said that during the debate, Brown was "drawing from the strength 
and the passion of her experiences" but was not literally describing her own 
experience. When asked about the incident at the news conference afterward, 
however, "she clarified that the experience was indeed her experience as a 
mother and as a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Brown wanted "to communicate that her feeling on these issues 
comes from a very personal source." He rejected the suggestion that Brown had 
overdramatized the incident, saying, "She tried to de-escalate it and simplify 
it, drawing on the most relevant feelings about the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Cerrell, a Los Angeles political consultant, said the rape disclosure 
could reverberate throughout the campaign's final three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, those sound bites that just stay with you: (Ronald) Reagan turning 
to (Jimmy) Carter, 'There he goes again.' Lloyd Bentsen giving (Dan Quayle) the 
John Kennedy shot. The (Gerald) Ford faux pas about Poland," Cerrell said, 
noting that these kinds of moments take on a life of their own. He predicted 
that Brown's rebuff of Wilson over crime "is what you'll remember from this 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Another parallel is a presidential debate in 1988 when Democrat Michael 
Dukakis, an opponent of the death penalty, was asked how he would react if his 
wife were raped. His response was so unemotional and academic that it was said 
to have contributed to his defeat by George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the Claremont Graduate School said that in the 
Wilson-Brown debate, Wilson got caught in the Dukakis trap, reacting without 
emotion to an issue about which he professes to care deeply. But despite this, 
she said, Brown hurt herself by appearing too contrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing of it, the choreography of it, the electoral arithmetic of it all 
led to the perception that it was a calculated performance targeted to women 
voters and to catch (Wilson) off guard," Jeffe said. "If indeed it was done to 
clarify her stance on crime, why wasn't it done earlier when it would not have 
looked so cynical?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what it reveals about Kathleen Brown -- and that's been her 
problem all along," Jeffe continued. "Her explanation does not appear to be 
resonating because she looked so programmed. . . . It may in the end hurt her, 
because it took the focus off the charges that she made against Pete Wilson. 
She has become the issue yet again."

HIGH COURT TO HEAR L.A. TEST CASE OF RACKETEERING LAW; APPEALS: ISSUE IS 
WHETHER DRUG RUNNER'S INVESTMENT IN GOLD MINE FALLS UNDER RICO STATUTE. LOWER 
COURT SAID NO; JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS YES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider the case of a Los Angeles 
lawyer who drove off with his client's Cadillac and $980,000 in drug cash, 
which he eventually used -- literally -- to open a gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
 A decorated Vietnam veteran and an honors graduate of Georgetown University 
Law School, Juan Paul Robertson worked as a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles 
during the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here is a person who, for the first 36 years of his life, did everything 
right," a federal judge said of Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 But after leaving the government in 1980, he set up shop as a criminal defense 
lawyer in Southern California -- and soon found himself in close contact with 
cocaine and the bags of cash it produced. In 1991, he was indicted on eight 
counts of dealing cocaine and running a criminal enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Convicted on most counts, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the high court announced that it would hear Robertson's case, not 
to examine a lawyer gone bad, but to clarify the reach of the federal 
anti-racketeering law. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Robertson's 
conviction on the drug charges, but it threw out his racketeering conviction on 
the theory that his gold mine in Alaska was an "entirely local operation." 
Because the federal racketeering law applies only to an "enterprise which is 
engaged in interstate commerce," it does not apply to criminals who funnel 
their money into strictly local businesses, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
 If allowed to stand, this ruling could dramatically weaken the 
anti-racketeering law, Justice Department lawyers said in their appeal, and 
allow organized crime figures to infiltrate small businesses with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Robertson appeared to have been a one-man organized crime wave 
during the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Juli Silva-Lopera was arrested on a drug charge, and he asked 
attorney Robertson to put in storage the Cadillac parked near his Reseda home. 
It contained two kilograms of cocaine and $980,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than keep it for his client, Robertson drove the car to Phoenix and had 
his estranged wife put the money in a bank deposit box. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Robertson was accused of doing the same with other clients by either 
taking bags of cash or large amounts of cocaine. He paid $270,000 in cash for a 
home in Phoenix and made other large purchases totaling $700,000. He also spent 
$250,000 to buy a gold mine in Alaska. Silva's Cadillac was sent to Fairbanks 
for use by the Robertson Mining Co. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, Congress passed the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations 
Act, commonly called RICO, to give prosecutors a weapon against organized crime 
bosses who invest their illegal cash in legitimate businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted under the law, mobsters can get long prison terms and the 
government can confiscate all their assets. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the justices will hear arguments in the Robertson case and rule 
by July on whether a business such as Robertson's gold mine can be the basis 
for a RICO violation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outcome will not necessarily change Robertson's prison term. His 
20-year sentence could be justified for the drug charges alone, prosecutors 
said.

RETURN TO REALITY; LAGUNA BEACH'S SPIDER LADY EMERGES FROM 21-YEAR 
SCHIZOPHRENIC ODYSSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She was a spindly apparition draped in black, a mask painted around her eyes. 
Some people called her the Spider Lady, others the Raccoon Lady. Frightened 
children shied away. 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 years, the bizarre, toothless character was a familiar figure roaming 
the streets of Laguna Beach, sleeping in church breezeways or in somebody's 
yard. Even in a town known for its eccentrics, she drew wide-eyed stares. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. remembers her sitting on a downtown bench for 
hours, with her matted hair and "Lone Ranger" mascara mask -- scratching 
herself, mumbling and drinking coffee. It seemed, he said, "a hopeless 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 But something amazing has happened to the mystery woman -- actually a literate 
former model from an upper-middle class background whose flair for creativity 
was pushed off the scales by schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the caring and devotion of an Episcopal priest, an Orange County 
mental health care worker and Friendship Shelter, Vanessa Ettinger has come 
back to reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her circumstance is pretty incredible," said Sandy Todd, the mental health 
care worker who helped Ettinger's transformation. "I don't think I've ever seen 
such a drastic change . . . with any other client." 
</P>
<P>
 On an overcast morning recently, Ettinger, 48, reflected on her past while she 
knitted and smoked cigarettes in the comfortable, cluttered Dana Point 
apartment she moved into when she left the shelter 18 months ago. She looks 
robust compared to the gaunt, outlandish waif who once wandered the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 She speaks of her life with a certain dispassion and seems to accept the 
peculiar version of herself that evolved with her illness -- the self who wore 
fake braids dragging to the ground or a hair net dripping with earrings. She 
does not see herself as others saw her, frightening and strange, barely 
clinging to the fringes of society. 
</P>
<P>
 Always, she said, she cared about her appearance, and even carried a travel 
iron in her shopping cart. She said she reveled in being creative, both with 
her makeup and with the clothes she wore. Although favoring basic black, she 
noted that on a good day she sometimes appeared on the streets all in purple. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not appear (so) to people, but (street people) worry about their 
appearance a lot," she said. "I always tried to keep up a 'model living at a 
resort' sort of appearance. That was my thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The painted face made her feel more attractive, she said. And more secure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was," she said, dismissing the subject, "just a phase I went through." 
</P>
<P>
 Ettinger has been through many phases, driven by the paranoid schizophrenia 
diagnosed when she was a young adult. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she was married once and has two children living in Vancouver. Her 
professional name is Vanessa but she now goes by her actual first name, Abbey. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Missouri and raised in Toronto, Ettinger is the eldest of six 
siblings, including two half sisters and a half brother. Her father, Donald 
(Red Dog) Ettinger, a former football player for the New York Giants in the 
late 1940s, is dead; her mother is in a Toronto convalescent home. 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother, Jim Ettinger, who lives in Arizona, remembers her as "the most 
beautiful, athletic, creative, intelligent young lady. And very loving to me, 
being my big sister." 
</P>
<P>
 But when she came to his college campus to visit in the late 1960s, he noticed 
a change. She seemed "confused, searching." 
</P>
<P>
 Not long afterward, in 1970, feeling depressed and restless, Ettinger hit the 
streets, leaving behind a 13-room house in Kansas City and a job with an 
advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was absolutely gorgeous, I mean knockout gorgeous," recalled Bernie 
Papin, president of the advertising agency where Ettinger once worked as a 
model and receptionist. "Her hair was always perfect, her makeup. She always 
looked like she stepped out of a Vogue magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 She hitchhiked across America on a trek that would eventually lead to Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Ettinger said his family did not hear from her for 21 years and it seemed 
as though she dropped off the planet. He consoled himself by imagining her 
living a happy life somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those years I just tried to picture her sitting . . . in a little place 
with a teacup full of tea and someone that would care about her and someone she 
could care about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reality of his sister's circumstances contrasted sharply with that 
gentle fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got raped and robbed a lot," she said. "But a lot of people were very nice 
to me, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Then around 1976, Ettinger came to Laguna Beach, a quaint resort town that so 
resembled her hometown near Toronto that she felt like she belonged. As 
Ettinger remembers the following years, she kept mostly to herself and relied 
on the kindness of strangers, many of whom gave her the cash that helped her 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd get up and sing for a while so I could get money," she said. "It's not a 
very honest way to live your life, but once you're on the streets . . . it's 
hard to get off. There aren't many opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, Ettinger disappeared for awhile, but always returned to Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 During one hiatus around 1978, Ettinger visited Papin at the advertising 
agency where she used to work. She appeared one day in his reception room, 
Papin said, bone thin, in tattered clothing, and her front teeth missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea who she was," he said. "It was an incredible thing. She was so 
frail. She looked like she was starving to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Papin said he ushered her into his office and gave her $50 and still did not 
know who she was when she left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two or three days later it dawned on me," he said. "It was her voice. For 
some reason, her voice flashed back." Papin never saw Ettinger again and, like 
her family, figured she was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ettinger hung on. About 10 years ago, she met the Rev. Colin Henderson 
when he welcomed her into St. Mary's Episcopal Church in Laguna Beach so she 
could sleep on a pew. "He was a very kind person and a very understanding 
person," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a defining moment in Ettinger's life, although she did not know it. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Henderson became director of Friendship Shelter. When Henderson told 
her she could stay there for two months, Ettinger remembers feeling 
"flabbergasted." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most places for the homeless aren't like that," she said. "You're lucky if 
you can stay two days. This place was a real opportunity. It was clean and neat 
and it was fun to be there. And the people were very, very nice." 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult at first. When a filthy, frightened and hostile Ettinger 
entered the shelter in 1991 she refused to follow rules or to take her 
medication consistently, shelter program manager Barbara Clippinger said. 
Ettinger was in and out of the shelter three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, late one night in 1992, she appeared at the shelter in particularly 
miserable condition after another detour back to Kansas City, Clippinger said, 
with lice in her hair and cockroaches in her clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Todd, Ettinger's caseworker, said she had taken on the "personal 
challenge" of getting her "on medication and into the system." Eventually, she 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Clippinger and Todd recall their surprise as Ettinger slowly began to emerge 
from her illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "She came in (to the shelter) . . . very primitive in her behavior, clothing 
and attitude," Clippinger said. "And then, all of a sudden, in her room I would 
find books on Degas and Monet from the library." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Todd: "Over the months, she would just blossom more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 Ettinger finally called her brother, and about 18 months ago, they were 
reunited when he came to Orange County to help her move into her Dana Point 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 It was both thrilling and shocking to see his sister after 21 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was glad she was alive but I just couldn't imagine that was the same 
person." He is now his sister's "payee," accepting the Social Security checks 
that support her and forwarding the money to pay her bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, last year, Ettinger took another leap by offering to speak at a 
Friendship Shelter fund-raiser. Clippinger was not sure what to expect. "I 
thought we would have the lady with the braids and the bags and the layered 
look," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ettinger arrived looking elegant and understated, wearing a flattering 
green sheath and just a whisper of makeup. She walked through the room, 
chatting with the guests, thanking them for having her and commenting on the 
hors d'oeuvres. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Ettinger's life is decidedly unglamorous. The apartment building where 
she lives is home to a collection of mental health patients who have become her 
friends. And there are reminders of her former life even in the new 
surroundings, including two long, black hairpieces spread smoothly on her 
dresser. 
</P>
<P>
 She lives normally, but within limitations. Her doctor said she will probably 
never work. Ettinger knows she must always take medication. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy now that I have my own apartment and my own furniture," she 
said. "I guess I'll just stay here and live out my life as a schizophrenic." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she is generally optimistic, Ettinger admits to a nagging foreboding 
that someday she could slip back into that darker world. "I still have a fear 
something will happen to me and I'll end up back there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she has embarked on a new beginning. Her life has taken on a relatively 
predictable rhythm. She watches television, goes to the movies and visits with 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so much better than being on the street," she said. "It's like day and 
night. It was so depressing on the streets and it's not depressing in my 
apartment or my new life." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Ettinger even talked on the phone to her daughter in Canada, their 
first conversation in 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really nice to hear her voice again, but she kept saying, 'You don't 
sound like my mother,' " Ettinger recalled. "She said, 'I haven't seen you 
since I was 7. Where have you been?' I told her the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth, as Clippinger sees it, is nothing short of a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is just a miracle that it took a whole community to support."

<P>
 Negotiators for the Angolan government and rebels agreed to a peace treaty 
Monday to end their 19-year civil war, pledging a cease-fire, disarmament and 
creation of a new army. 
</P>
<P>
 Alioune Blondin Beye, the U.N. special representative who mediated the 
negotiations, said the 10-point agreement seeks not just to silence the guns 
but to heal the divisions that have led to the deaths of more than half a 
million Angolans.

NEWS ANALYSIS; KOHL'S REAL CHALLENGE COMES AFTER ELECTION WIN; GERMANY: WITH 
SLIGHT 10-SEAT ADVANTAGE IN PARLIAMENT, HE FACES AN UPHILL BATTLE AGAINST A 
TOUGHENED OPPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Chancellor Helmut Kohl's winning coalition government was on the defensive 
Monday as political commentators pondered how long it could survive with weak 
allies and a toughened opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 ARD public television drew a black eye on a picture of the smiling Kohl, whose 
stubborn optimism put him first across the finish line in Sunday's federal 
election to claim a skimpy majority of 48.4% of the popular vote to 48.1% for 
the combined opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a big loss from 54.8% of the vote in 1990 -- reunified Germany's 
first federal election -- and gives the government a bare 10-seat advantage in 
a newly expanded 672-seat Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten seats do not leave the government much leeway -- not much room for its 
members of Parliament to opt out of a vote or even miss a day of work, let 
alone defect from the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, such a slim majority in a coalition government means Kohl 
will have a tough time implementing his political agenda -- to complete the 
process of German reunification and the forging of a European Union, to 
"modernize" the German economy and to trim the social welfare state. 
</P>
<P>
 At worst, his coalition eventually unravels at its tender seams. 
</P>
<P>
 "This majority will have to be defended for four years from one parliamentary 
vote to the next," said ARD commentator Nikolaus Brender. 
</P>
<P>
 The 64-year-old Kohl waves off naysayers, vowing to finish out a fourth 
four-year term that would make him Germany's longest-reigning leader since 
19th-Century Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. 
</P>
<P>
 "A majority is a majority," Kohl said Monday, quoting former Chancellor Willy 
Brandt, a Social Democrat who governed with a 12-seat advantage in Parliament. 
Kohl said his predecessor, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, had a 10-seat majority 
like his own, "and it still took us (six years) to take over the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl's political enemies are not wasting any time. The Social Democrats 
prepared to take advantage of tensions already evident in the chancellor's 
three-party coalition and predicted Kohl would fall before the end of his term. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Bundesbank on Monday urged Kohl to carry out promised cuts in federal 
budget deficits, defeated Social Democratic leader Rudolf Scharping vowed to be 
an opposition watchdog on jobs, social welfare and the ecology. His party was 
strengthened in Parliament's lower house, or Bundestag, and most likely 
increased its majority in the upper house, or Bundesrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the leftist Greens Party, which made its way back into Parliament 
with 7.3% of the vote, said they hope the opposition can force Kohl into new 
elections in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl faces challenges within his own Christian Democratic Union and his 
coalition, as well. The CDU, together with its Bavarian sister party, the 
Christian Social Union, remains the largest political bloc in the country, but 
their coalition partner, the liberal Free Democratic Party, saw its vote 
plummet to 6.9% from 11% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The liberal party, which has shared power with most post-war governments, also 
has lost seats in the last nine state legislative elections, including three on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Christian Democratic leaders complained that the liberal party had 
survived only by usurping the votes of their supporters, who wanted to save the 
small party -- and the coalition -- from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 The more conservative CSU, meanwhile, said it had grown stronger than the 
liberals in the election and should have a greater voice in policy-making. CSU 
leaders said the Free Democrats should give up at least one of their five 
Cabinet posts -- possibly the Justice Ministry -- and give ground on 
law-and-order issues. They have blocked a government measure to allow the 
bugging of private telephones for criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Free Democrat leaders, however, made it clear that they plan to flex their 
weakened muscles even more now that Kohl needs their every vote in Parliament. 
They acknowledge that they can rebuild themselves and forge a new identity only 
if they are seen as independent of the Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Democrats' ace is the possibility that they could abandon the 
coalition to support a Social Democratic government. The two parties formed a 
government in 1969, making Brandt chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
 The party denies any interest in joining the Social Democrats again, although 
FDP floor leader Hermann Otto Solms noted that "now we have an alternative." 
The Social Democrats, Greens and liberals would have enough votes in the new 
Parliament to form a government if they should choose to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Parliament is to meet before Nov. 15 with an inaugural speech by its 
eldest member, in this case Stefan Heym, an eastern German writer who won as 
part of the reformed Communist Party of Democratic Socialism. 
</P>
<P>
 The PDS won 30 seats in the new Parliament and promises to "engage in debate" 
with the traditional parties led by westerners. They are likely to vote with 
the Social Democrats on major social and economic issues, even though the 
Social Democrats insist they would never form a federal government with the 
former Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 The PDS vote in the East, like the increased vote for Social Democrats across 
the country, is seen by the German press as a sign that many voters are tired 
of Kohl's 12-year government and of the recession that has hit Germany in 
recent years. Kohl's slim victory, they say, is not so much a confirmation of a 
job well done as nervousness about change. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Sunday's vote, Kohl announced that he would not run for a fifth term in 
1998, feeding speculation about his successor and intensifying the jockeying 
between centrists and conservatives in the party. After the vote, a politically 
weakened Kohl can no longer expect to name his own replacement.

U.S., N. KOREA REPORTEDLY REACH DRAFT ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and North Korea reached a draft agreement to ease months of 
tension over the North's nuclear program, the chief U.S. negotiator said late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Gallucci said that the draft will be sent to Washington and to 
Pyongyang for approval and that negotiators hope to sign the document in Geneva 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to give details of the accord, but said it was "broadly acceptable 
and positive" for the United States and North Korea's neighbors, including 
South Korea and Japan. It also addressed concerns about North Korea's past 
nuclear program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times had reported Saturday that the Clinton Administration was preparing 
to conclude a far-reaching new agreement with Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and others fear North Korea has already made at least one 
atomic bomb, although North Korea insists its nuclear program is for peaceful 
purposes only. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement builds on one reached in August in which North Korea offered to 
open up its nuclear facilities to international inspection and scrap its 
outdated atomic energy program. That program uses old-fashioned technology that 
produces more bomb-making plutonium than modern reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, Washington offered low-level diplomatic ties and help in building 
safer nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, little progress has been made. Some speculated that a power vacuum 
in North Korea following the death of Kim Il Sung made it impossible for 
negotiators in Geneva to act with authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Jong Il, the late leader's son, appeared in public Sunday for the first 
time since his father's funeral in July, signaling that he has taken power. 
However, he has not formally assumed the positions of president and Communist 
Party leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakthrough in the talks apparently came as a result of telephone 
negotiations and the exchange of faxed texts of the final document between the 
two sides Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallucci said the accord tackled the issue of international inspection of two 
sites near Pyongyang where the United Nations' watchdog International Atomic 
Energy Agency says there could be evidence of a North Korean nuclear weapons 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beijing, Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian told U.S. Defense Secretary 
William J. Perry on Monday that China, North Korea's main ally, would try to 
help end the impasse. A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said China did not want North Korea to have nuclear weapons.

POLITICS; POWER VS. CHANGE: THE DIMENSION OF FOLEY'S CAMPAIGN ORDEAL; HOUSE 
SPEAKER'S REELECTION BID IS DEEMED A TOSSUP. HIS GOP FOE, AIDED BY CONSERVATIVE 
GROUPS, CAPITALIZES ON DISSATISFACTION WITH CONGRESS. 
</P>

<P>
 There is a keen appreciation for political power here on the remote eastern 
border of the state of Washington, a landscape of arid farmlands and piney 
foothills. For years, people in these parts enjoyed more than their share of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is power compared to change, they now ask themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 So here is Democratic Rep. Thomas S. Foley -- 30 years in Congress, Speaker of 
the House, second in line to succeed the President -- battling for his 
political survival the only way he knows how. He is bringing home a slice of 
bacon. He is at a press conference announcing a federal grant to help provide 
33 new law enforcement officers for his district. 
</P>
<P>
 "For comparison," he tells his constituents in his jowly deadpan, "Spokane has 
a higher grant than San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 Power. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, here is his opponent, mild-mannered, would-be giant slayer George 
Nethercutt, the Republican. He has found Foley's glaring weak spot: Power has a 
bad name. And a sizable chunk of American conservatism has jumped in on 
Nethercutt's side to bring Foley down -- the National Rifle Assn., the National 
Taxpayer's Union, term limits advocates, the Christian right. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need a Speaker. . . . We need a listener," Nethercutt proclaims on 
billboards all over town. 
</P>
<P>
 Change. 
</P>
<P>
 All politics is not local. Not now. Sometimes the itch for something new is 
unbearably strong, and voters feel the deep need to scratch -- even if it 
hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Foley's 1994 ordeal, and it has produced one of America's most 
celebrated electoral tossups. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks now, the polls have shown that Foley is in danger of losing; history 
says he won't. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since 1860 has a Speaker of the House been defeated. But it has been a 
good long while since voters have been so agitated with their Congress and 
their federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "This race is not about anything except change vs. power. There is no other 
dimension to it," says Terry Holt, a Washington, D.C., operative brought in to 
aid Nethercutt's move into the political big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley's 5th Congressional District always has been independent-minded and 
somewhat conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 It is about one-third rural, more than 50% college educated, virtually all 
white and uncommonly dependent on Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers here count on government for irrigation water and the usual assortment 
of agricultural supports. Fairchild Air Force Base is a big employer and has 
escaped any threat of closure. The Colville National Forest is managed by the 
Department of Agriculture and produces mill jobs. Native American interests 
fall under the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The epic dams of the Columbia River 
are operated by government and quasi-government agencies and provide the 
cheapest electricity in America. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Foley's domain, and he has quietly ruled it as he saw fit, following 
former House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr.'s "all politics is local" 
adage. Federal bureaucrats moved in these parts knowing that the Speaker's 
office would be watching. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quality of Foley's local stewardship is barely a subtext in this 
election campaign. Helped along by a froth of broadcast advertising and talk 
radio, voters seem fixed on the more abstract matters of America's Angst -- its 
direction, its leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer confident of government, swing voters seem drawn, at least so far, 
to a fuzzy consensus behind Nethercutt's simple call for less government. Send 
a message, kick 'em in the pants, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we win, we'll make history," Nethercutt replies by way of encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent poll shows him leading by 10 points. Another shows Foley pulling 
almost even. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, people of Eastern Washington -- who feel isolated from their own 
state Capitol, not to mention the U.S. Capitol -- have defended their 
congressional clout. Twice in recent years as the brush fire of term-limit 
initiatives swept the nation, the 5th District voted against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley led these campaigns. He warned constituents that they would be yielding 
influence in Congress to states without term limits. Californians, with all 
their votes in the House, would trample Washington's weakened delegation and 
divert water south from the Columbia River, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This November, Foley's hopes rest chiefly on persuading these swing voters to 
again cast a pragmatic ballot in their own interest rather than following their 
angry, idealistic impulses. 
</P>
<P>
 His task is made difficult because Nethercutt is proving to be an attractive 
candidate, more so than Foley's other recent foes. 
</P>
<P>
 At 49, Nethercutt is a civil attorney who contracts services to small towns 
and represents families in adoption matters. He headed the Spokane chapter of 
the Diabetes Foundation and helped found a crisis nursery for abused children. 
And he can claim Washington, D.C., connections as former chief of staff to U.S. 
Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). He has maintained a friendship with GOP political 
consultant Edward J. Rollins, who is advising Nethercutt on strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 In tone, Nethercutt's campaign is measured. But the overall campaign against 
Foley is not. The NRA, a group crusading for term limits, the National 
Taxpayer's Union and a Virginia-based political action committee are raising 
the rhetorical heat against the Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 If they follow through on their pledges, these groups and others will likely 
spend as much against Foley as Nethercutt is spending on his own behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley is likely to match the opposition dollar for dollar, making this a 
$3-million race in a district where broadcast advertising sells for a song. 
</P>
<P>
 But he appears uncomfortable with the demands of running as the underdog in 
this era of cutthroat partisanship. 
</P>
<P>
 At 65, the Speaker is by nature a courtly, understated politician who likes to 
think of himself as above making personal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democratic political pros have warned Foley that he will lose unless he 
gets tough in these closing days before the Nov. 8 election. Tony Coelho, a 
political adviser to the White House, told reporters that Foley needed to start 
running an "aggressive, professional" campaign to begin "educating" voters 
about Nethercutt, which is political-speak for "slash and burn." 
</P>
<P>
 This Foley has begun to do, although the results are questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley has charged that Nethercutt's position on congressional spending bills 
would result in cuts for such things as child immunizations. Nethercutt 
scoffed. Would people believe that of a man whose own daughter had diabetes and 
who had his record of supporting children's programs? 
</P>
<P>
 Foley said Nethercutt was against reducing the size of the federal government. 
This on the questionable ground that the GOP candidate opposed the anti-crime 
bill passed by Congress, which is funded by a previously approved cut in the 
federal work force. But will voters find that a credible charge against a 
Republican who campaigns for less government, less taxes, less regulation and 
less welfare? 
</P>
<P>
 A more persuasive tack may be Foley's repeated accusation that Nethercutt is a 
pawn of conservative special interests, like the NRA. "I don't think people in 
this district need outside groups coming in and telling them how to vote," 
Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 To which Nethercutt's campaign replies: Who gets more special-interest backing 
than the Speaker? 
</P>
<P>
 On these matters in this strange year, the leadership of the House appears to 
rest.

GAZA MILITANTS DEMAND ARAFAT FREE DETAINEES; MIDEAST: IN THIRD DAY OF PROTESTS, 
HAMAS THREATENS BLOODSHED UNLESS ALL ACTIVISTS ARE RELEASED.

 In a growing challenge to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, thousands of 
Islamic militants rioted outside the central jail here Monday, demanding 
freedom for arrested fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "No to the police state! No to prison!" shouted protesters who gathered in 
pouring rain, some shooting bullets into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahmoud Zahar, a leader of the fundamentalist Hamas movement, threatened 
bloodshed unless all 210 activists detained last week after the kidnaping of an 
Israeli soldier are released. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian officials persuaded the crowd, estimated at between 5,000 and 
10,000 people, to disperse after three hours. The officials released 60 
detainees and promised the rest will be home within days. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Palestinian commander said the police will soon begin confiscating 
unregistered weapons in the Gaza Strip, signaling a possible crackdown on 
Izzidin al-Qassam, Hamas' armed wing. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third day of anti-Arafat protests in Gaza, where a fragile 
coexistence between the 5-month-old autonomy government and its fundamentalist 
opposition appears to have been thrown off balance by the kidnaping last week 
of an Israeli soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 Cpl. Nachshon Waxman's captors killed him Friday as Israeli commandos stormed 
their hide-out north of Jerusalem. An Israeli commando and three kidnapers also 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's protest began at the house of one of the dead kidnapers. Two PLO 
police cars tried to get to the head of the march to the jail, but more than 
100 Hamas supporters forced the cars off the road. 
</P>
<P>
 When they reached the jail, angry protesters surged against a fence, 
surrounding it and shouting "Hamas will shake the land" and "We'll burn Gaza" 
at hundreds of armed and helmeted Palestine Liberation Organization police. 
Dozens of the protesters tried to scale the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down with Nasser Yusuf," the crowd also chanted, calling for the dismissal of 
the Palestinian police chief, Maj. Gen. Nasser Yusuf.

FOR JORDANIANS, TREATY MEANS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE; REACTION: 
CITIZENS IN THE CAPITAL SAY THEY WANT PEACE, PROSPERITY. THEIR KING IS COUNTING 
ON THOSE HOPES TO BOLSTER HIS DECISION.

 In the working-class area of downtown Amman and the chic restaurants of the 
upscale Shmeisaneh district, Jordanians on Monday welcomed the draft peace 
treaty with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who hates peace?" asked Majaad Ghanma as he bought pastries at Shmeisaneh's 
Jabri patisserie. "The main thing is for Jordanians to feel that we are not 
expecting war anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have peace of mind to plan for the future, and for 50 years, all 
we had was uncertainty and war," said Ghanma, an administrator at Yarmouk 
University. "As long as our rights have been preserved, this is a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of town, in a crowded, working-class coffee shop filled with 
men smoking water pipes and playing backgammon, Salim abu Dahab echoed Ghanma's 
sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that most of the people welcome this treaty," said Abu Dahab, a 
businessman whose family fled Jaffa, since incorporated with Tel Aviv, in 1948, 
when the Jewish state was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 60, Abu Dahab says he no longer dreams of returning to Jaffa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is impossible," he said. "Only low-class people and fundamentalists are 
thinking of going back to Palestine. I am 60. What do I know about Jaffa? It 
exists only in my imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of dreaming of return, Abu Dahab said, he thinks of doing business 
with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until now, we hear about peace and we read about peace, but we don't feel 
peace," he said. "We want to feel it, and the way to do that is through 
business. If there is business transactions, then people will welcome this 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the hopes of people such as Abu Dahab and Ghanma -- the desire to live a 
normal life and enjoy economic security and prosperity -- that King Hussein is 
counting on to counterbalance the shock of making peace with the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Arab-Israeli peace talks opened in Madrid three years ago, Hussein has 
gradually prepared the population for the signing of a full peace treaty with 
Israel. There has been more reporting here on peace negotiations, and on news 
occurring inside Israel, than in any other Arab country. Meetings between 
Hussein and Rabin have become almost routine, and Hussein is the only Arab 
leader who has agreed to conduct bilateral negotiations in Israel and to 
welcome Israeli negotiators in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Monday's agreement came as a surprise to most people here -- even 
newspaper editors were reduced to turning their channels to Israel Television's 
live broadcast of the Hussein-Rabin news conference to learn that a draft 
treaty had indeed been agreed on. 
</P>
<P>
 There is likely to be some opposition expressed by Islamic fundamentalists and 
left-wing peace opponents, but neither group is particularly strong in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 On Amman's crowded sidewalks Monday night, many people still had not heard the 
news, several hours after the draft treaty was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Babiche coffee shop in Shmeisaneh, Palestinian students were divided in 
their reactions when a reporter told them that a treaty is scheduled to be 
signed on the Israeli-Jordanian border next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good step," said Maha Abdul Hadi, an 18-year-old student at Amman 
University. Born in the West Bank, Abdul Hadi grew up in Saudi Arabia after her 
family decided to leave. But she holds a Jordanian passport and said she feels 
both Jordanian and Palestinian now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to do something," Abdul Hadi said. "Now, everybody is talking about 
peace. Maybe, with this treaty, it will be easy for us to travel from here to 
Palestine. That would be a good thing."

<P>
 Bayan Dawood, sitting across from Abdul Hadi, shook her head in disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not convinced that we should make peace with Israel at all," said the 
18-year-old Dawood, whose father was born in Nablus. "Many people had their 
children and their brothers die fighting the Jews, and then we make peace, 
after all that? When I think about the people that died, I feel selfish for 
making peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawood declared that she will never visit Israel "until it is Palestine, and 
until it is all ours again." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, in the Al Sultan coffee shop, a group of young Jordanian 
businessmen said the treaty might not please Palestinians -- who make up more 
than 50% of the population here -- but will certainly be good for Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, so good," said Munief Tall, 26, a junior executive with the Jordanian 
Petroleum Co. Tall said that Israeli businessmen had already started faxing his 
company, putting out feelers for business possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not?" he asked. "Nobody knows the future, but I think this will be good 
for business." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the only choice," said Ali Dbbas, 24, a salesman with an agricultural 
products manufacturing firm. "There is no other choice for Jordan. There should 
be no more fights."

QUEEN ELIZABETH MAKES HISTORIC VISIT TO RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Queen Elizabeth II, leaving behind the latest Royal Family flap, came to the 
Kremlin on Monday on the first visit to Russia by a British monarch. 
</P>
<P>
 A new authorized biography of her son and heir, Prince Charles, threatened to 
overshadow the visit by the queen and her husband, Prince Philip.In the book, 
Charles accuses Philip of forcing him into a loveless marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin's chief spokesman, Vyacheslav V. Kostikov, 
said the queen's visit is evidence of Russia's break with its totalitarian 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize that the British queen would never have visited a Communist 
country," Kostikov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the queen and Prince Philip are related to the imperial Romanov family of 
Czar Nicholas II, executed by Bolshevik revolutionaries in 1918. The queen's 
grandfather, King George V, the czar's first cousin, refused to give Nicholas 
II asylum a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The 68-year-old queen, wearing a fur coat and pillbox hat, was greeted at 
Moscow's Vnukovo-2 airport by First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg N. Soskovets. A 
beaming Yeltsin and his wife, Naina, gave the royal couple a formal welcome at 
the ornate St. George's Hall in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 The royal couple are staying in the Kremlin as Yeltsin's guests. They attended 
a performance of "Giselle" at the Bolshoi Ballet on Monday evening, sitting in 
the "czar's box" under the coat of arms of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Britain, newspapers were full of speculation about excerpts from the 
biography of Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles recalls how, as a boy, his mother paid him little attention and his 
father belittled him to the point of tears. As an adult, Charles suggests that 
Philip pressured him into marrying Princess Diana, whom he says he never loved.

FIRM REAPS PROFIT FROM DESOLATE PRISON SITE; REAL ESTATE: COMPANY, AIDED BY 
FORMER CORRECTIONS OFFICIAL, BOUGHT PESTICIDE-TAINTED LAND NEAR COALINGA FOR 
$374 AN ACRE AND SOLD IT TO STATE FOR $3,500 AN ACRE. BUSINESS PARTNER CALLS 
DEAL A FAIR ONE.

 When Pleasant Valley State Prison opens next month, inmates won't find much 
pleasant about California's newest prison. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hot in the summer, chilly in the winter. Wind causes blinding dust 
storms. Nearby faults periodically cause strong earthquakes. For this expanse 
of flat, dry land, California paid a premium -- $2.183 million -- or $3,500 an 
acre. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the land was cleaned of pesticides and other toxins, the state 
ended up spending more than $3 million -- the equivalent of more than $5,000 an 
acre. Farmland in the area sells for maybe $2,000 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pleasant Valley land deal is one of several in which California paid large 
sums to rural landowners for property where it builds prisons. Sellers include 
major farming corporations, a timber company, a bank and wealthy business 
people. Many are campaign donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in 1987, the Department of Corrections, working with townsfolk, began 
looking for suitable land near Coalinga. By 1990, it had homed in on a 623-acre 
site owned by a partnership called Triple D Farms. 
</P>
<P>
 To help consummate the deal, Triple D hired Rodney Blonien, the former 
undersecretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency. Don Devine, a 
partner in Triple D, said he and his partners selected Blonien because he "knew 
his way around and we didn't know our way around." 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that Triple D Farms bought the land as part of a 5,000-acre 
purchase from Bank of America. The price was $1.875 million, or $374 per acre. 
"When we bought the land, we had no idea (that a prison would go in)," Devine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 24, 1990, two weeks after Triple D's purchase was recorded, the 
Corrections Department convened a hearing in Coalinga, one focus of which was 
where the prison would be built. 
</P>
<P>
 Blonien told the hearing that his clients' "very clear and distinct wish" was 
that the state would place the prison on their land, a transcript shows. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1990, the state Department of Real Estate appraised the property, 
concluding that Triple D got an exceptional deal when it bought the 5,000 
acres. It placed the worth of the 623-acre portion at $2,000 an acre, plus 
$462,000 for buildings on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the state commissioned an environmental assessment of Triple D's 
land. The assessment revealed that cleanup of pesticides and other toxics on 
the land would cost $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that report, the state considered looking elsewhere. But the search 
ended after a 1991 meeting attended by prison officials, Blonien and 
Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno), notes of the meeting show. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa, one of two co-authors of the "three strikes" legislation, has six 
prisons in his district, including Pleasant Valley. The meeting notes show that 
Costa brought up several problems with moving, and that he pointed to a second 
consultant's estimate that the cleanup of Triple D's land would cost only about 
a third as much as projected. 
</P>
<P>
 Triple D's partners have contributed to Costa's campaigns, giving him $3,000 
last year, reports show. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Devine called the final sale price a fair one. He also said 
Costa is a good legislator and a friend, who would have helped him regardless 
of whether he had received donations. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Costa said he convened the meeting to urge corrections 
officials to resolve the problem, not to force them into choosing the Triple D 
site. He added that he has gotten involved in several other prison issues in 
his district, and said donations from Triple D partners had "absolutely" 
nothing to do with his decision to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a constituent of mine has a problem, we try to help out. That's my job," 
Costa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant who proposed -- and ended up doing -- the $775,000 cleanup was 
Keith Scrivner, a former mayor of Coalinga who owns an engineering and 
environmental firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrivner, who left office as mayor in October, 1990, said he received the work 
in 1991 because he and Triple D partners were friends, and he could do the job 
for less than other contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I happened to be in the right place and in the right business when this came 
along," Scrivner said.

POLITICAL SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 21 days to go before Californians go to the polls 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Monday: Republican Gov. Pete Wilson met with Asian American 
supporters in Westminster after visiting Little Saigon. Democrat Kathleen Brown 
made appearances in San Francisco and San Diego to discuss her plan to cut $5 
billion in government waste and spending. She was joined by Ted Gaebler, author 
of "Reinventing Government," who would lead the effort if she is elected, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Brown planned to discuss cutting benefits and privileges for 
government officials during an appearance in Los Angeles and will campaign in 
the Central Valley. Wilson joins Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to discuss 
job creation with small business owners in Hollywood and the San Fernando 
Valley, and visits a business in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Monday: Both candidates reported their campaign spending for 
the period ending Sept. 30. The total came to more than $27 million, a record 
for a U.S. Senate contest. Sen. Dianne Feinstein discussed gun-free schools at 
a high school in Reseda and benefits of the new federal crime legislation in 
Pasadena. Rep. Mike Huffington and Sens. Phil Gramm of Texas and John McCain of 
Arizona addressed a veterans rally in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Feinstein was scheduled for a morning television interview and 
planned to join Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block for a tour of the 
sheriff's training bureau in Whittier. Huffington launches a four-day bus tour 
of California with a rally in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTABLE QUOTE 
</P>
<P>
 "In the final analysis, and in the absence of much definitive knowledge about 
Michael Huffington the man, we must conclude that he is a candidate for the 
U.S. Senate principally because he has the money to finance an expensive 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Santa Barbara News-Press, in editorial endorsing Feinstein in the Senate 
race 
</P>
<P>
 A LIGHTER NOTE 
</P>
<P>
 So what does it really take to campaign for office in California? A good 
sandwich, claim the makers of Ziploc sandwich bags and their public relations 
firm, which announced that Nov. 2 is Ziploc National Sandwich Day. The press 
release proclaims the discovery of "the real story on what makes California's 
candidates tick -- their sandwich values." Wilson's favorite sandwich was 
reported to be "lean and mean," ordered during his budget battles: turkey on 
whole wheat bread, no mayonnaise. Brown's was "California vegetarian:" 
Six-grain whole wheat bread, avocado, Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato and alfalfa 
sprouts.

MUST KEEP CHILDREN AWAY FROM CRIME, CLINTON SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton decried youth violence Monday, reminding a convention of 
police officers of a recent Chicago tragedy in which two boys, 10 and 11, 
murdered a 5-year-old who had refused to steal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can hire 5 million police officers and, if we keep losing the battle for 
what these kids think is right and wrong, we're going to be in a lot of 
trouble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are going to look up to somebody," Clinton said. "It's up to the adults 
in this country to decide who they're going to look up to." 
</P>
<P>
 America has many resources to carry it into the future, Clinton said. "But 
what we must be worried about is wave upon wave upon wave of these little 
children who don't have somebody both good and strong to look up to, who are so 
vulnerable that their hearts can be turned to stone by the time they're 10 or 
11 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 As is often the case, those remarks -- which formed the emotional highlight of 
Clinton's speech -- came as a departure from his prepared text. Aides said that 
Clinton penned the thoughts while flying here from Washington, adding them to a 
text initially focused on the anti-crime bill that passed Congress in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's speech, to the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police, came as part 
of a continuing campaign by the Administration to rehabilitate the anti-crime 
bill, which has come under unrelenting attack from Republicans, who have 
attempted -- with some success -- to hang the "pork" label on the package. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to that charge, Clinton told the convention that with the bill now 
law, federal and local officials together must "demonstrate to our people that 
the money is being well spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most of its life, this crime bill enjoyed broad, bipartisan support," 
Clinton said. But, he said, the bill "became a political football" at the end 
of the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must never again permit crime to be divisive in a partisan political way," 
Clinton declared. He almost immediately followed that declaration with an 
attack on Republicans, suggesting that the GOP's pledge to both balance the 
federal budget and cut taxes would require "cuts in everything else" including 
"this crime bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks generally were well received by his audience. White House 
officials hope that personal endorsements of the crime bill's provisions by 
local law enforcement officials will help refurbish the image of the package. 
In a further effort toward that end, the Administration has begun rapidly 
distributing the money for more police officers contained in the bill, 
releasing the first round of grants last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Clinton announced new rules designed to speed up additional 
grants. The rules will allow many cities to hire additional officers before 
actually receiving their federal money, with Washington paying part of the 
payroll costs once the officers are sworn in.

CONTRACTORS CHARGING U.S. FOR CONCERTS AND TENNIS, PROBE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense and environmental contractors have charged the government for 
"employee morale" expenses that included a Smokey Robinson concert, tennis 
lessons and professional quality golf balls, House investigators reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a time of tight fiscal constraints, limited tax dollars designed for 
defense or environmental protection should not be squandered on expensive rock 
concerts . . . or tennis court time," Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote to 
Alice Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July, Dingell's staff on the House Energy and Commerce investigations 
subcommittee has been compiling information on contractor charges for 
recreation and "employee morale." 
</P>
<P>
 The House investigators said Defense Department auditors this month questioned 
$3.3 million in contractor entertainment and recreation charges, and $832,000 
for employee awards and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the findings involved expenditures by Martin Marietta, 
headquartered in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 The company or its subsidiaries charged the government $263,000 for a Smokey 
Robinson concert in Denver; $417,629 between Oct. 1, 1991, and last July 24 for 
maintenance and operation of a park for company employees at Oak Ridge, Tenn.; 
$20,194 for professional quality golf balls over the last three fiscal years, 
and $7,589 in fiscal 1994 for a Christmas party account in Oak Ridge, including 
$200 for a performer to play Santa Claus at a party for employees' children. 
</P>
<P>
 Other findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * $243,000 in employee morale charges by Ecology and Environment Inc. of 
Lancaster, N.Y., and $37,000 for recreation, including employee tennis lessons 
and court time, bike races, golf tournaments and company-sponsored softball and 
soccer leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Frank, vice president for finance, said the environmental firm bills such 
items as overhead costs to all its customers. Frank estimated the government's 
share was only about a third as large as House investigators reported. 
</P>
<P>
 * $63,000 for crystal decanters for employee awards by defense contractor 
Science Applications International Corp., San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Science Applications spokeswoman Sue Volek said the decanters cost only 
$14,000. Volek added the company had reversed its decision to charge the 
government, even though the billing would have been proper under federal rules.

HUNTER IS MISSING AS SNOWS STRIKE COLORADO; 11 OTHERS ARE RESCUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One Oklahoma hunter was missing Monday and about a dozen others were stranded 
in remote sections of southwestern Colorado after heavy snowstorms causing 
drifts of up to five feet blanketed the area, sheriffs' offices said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still searching for one hunter," said Linda Stock, spokeswoman for the 
La Plata sheriff's office in Durango. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Chance, 45, of Ponca City, Okla., separated from three other hunters in 
his party Saturday morning and has not been seen since, she said. However, he 
was dressed warmly and had some provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Russell Hebert of neighboring Archuleta County said 10 stranded 
hunters were found Sunday night and an 11th, who was lost in the adjacent 
county of Hinsdale, was found Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The slow-moving winter-like storm over the Rockies dumped more than a foot of 
snow in parts of Colorado and Wyoming on Monday, adding to weekend 
accumulations. A winter storm warning was posted for the Big Horn Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The hunting season got under way Saturday. On that day a hunter from Minnesota 
accidentally shot his 33-year-old son just over the northern border with 
Wyoming, investigators said. Conditions were very foggy, they said, and the 
victim's bright orange safety vest was found near the body.

BIGGER DOSES OF HEART DRUG PERILOUS, 2 STUDIES REPORT; MEDICINE: JUST SLIGHT 
INCREASES OF HEPARIN DOUBLE RISK OF SEVERE STROKES, RESEARCHERS SAY. BUT THE 
FDA CONTENDS IT IS GENERALLY SAFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slightly increasing the dose of a drug commonly used to treat heart attacks 
almost doubles patients' risk of devastating strokes, two studies published 
Monday said. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings on the drug heparin caused researchers to suspend the studies in 
April, and in Monday's edition of the journal Circulation they warned doctors 
to be careful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know there was a dark side to heparin," study co-author Dr. Eric 
Topol of the Cleveland Clinic said. "We learned it has a very narrow window for 
safety." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Food and Drug Administration insists most patients get lower doses 
that are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message should be don't panic," Dr. Janet Woodcock of the FDA said. 
"We're unconvinced there's widespread use of higher doses of heparin." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite 80 years of use, nobody knew the upper limits of heparin, which is 
commonly given -- along with clot-dissolving drugs -- to thin the blood of 
heart attack victims. All such drugs pose the danger of uncontrolled bleeding 
and stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Topol and another group of investigators at Harvard accidentally discovered 
heparin's upper limit while comparing its effectiveness to that of an 
experimental drug called hirudin. 
</P>
<P>
 Just months into the study, researchers noticed that both drugs increased the 
risk of stroke two times above that normally seen in heart attack patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-six of Topol's 2,564 heart attack victims who received either heparin 
or hirudin suffered a stroke. Thirteen of the 713 Harvard patients suffered a 
stroke. More than half of the stroke victims died. 
</P>
<P>
 The risks from each drug were comparable. 
</P>
<P>
 That this occurred with hirudin wasn't so surprising. Hirudin, derived from 
leeches, is a very potent anticoagulant that is still in the testing phase, 
when risks are discovered. But Topol says he was shocked that heparin given at 
just 20% above normal doses was dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommended heparin dose is 5,000 units initially, with hourly injections 
individualized so the patient's blood takes twice as long as normal to clot. 
Topol increased that to three times the normal clotting time. 
</P>
<P>
 The trials were suspended April 8. But Topol and the FDA decided against 
immediately alerting outside doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA insists most doctors already use very low doses of heparin. "If we'd 
felt people were being put at risk, we would have" warned doctors, Woodcock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Topol disagreed. "I know many cardiologists who are much more aggressive with 
heparin than what we have advocated." 
</P>
<P>
 The two U.S. trials were restarted in May with routine heparin doses and 
hirudin doses cut in half. The 3,000 patients enrolled since then have reported 
no problems.

 Rivers and creeks raged with floodwater Monday in southeastern Texas, killing 
at least six people and chasing thousands from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The torrential storms began Sunday, pounding some areas with up to 20 inches 
of rain by Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 residents downstream from a dam 60 miles northeast of Houston were 
told to evacuate because of the rising Trinity River, and 5,000 residents to 
the south fled their low-lying homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad, and it looks like we're not going to get any better," Polk County 
Sheriff Billy Nelson said. "We have had lots of rescues. We've got people 
hanging onto tree limbs and stuff. It's pitiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said the waters in some areas had reached rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the worst flooding was in Montgomery County, about 40 miles north of 
Houston. Water from a flooded creek swept a car carrying two men off a road 
Sunday. One body was found; the other remained missing. 
</P>
<P>
 A man trying to drive through high water in Grimes County drowned when his 
pickup was swept into a swollen creek and overturned. A car carrying a woman 
and four children was carried away by a flash flood in the same county. The 
woman and two children survived, a third child was drowned and a fourth was 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Searchers were using horses and planes to look for the missing child. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current is so strong right now that boats are just out of the question," 
Sheriff's Deputy Jackie Siracusa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other fatalities included an elderly man found dead in his truck near a 
highway in Polk County after he tried to drive through high water, Nelson said. 
A man died of a heart attack when his van got stuck as he tried to cross a 
flooded highway in Conroe, police Lt. Russell Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 And a man's body was found floating in a rain-swollen ditch just east of 
Houston. Details were not released, but authorities attributed the death to 
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 A subdivision near Conroe, 25 miles north of Houston, was swamped in 
waist-high water. Authorities were evacuating hundreds of homes in the upscale 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelters were set up at a Lutheran church in Conroe and two schools in Polk 
County. Some people hunkered down in their homes to wait out the storms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure we can stay as long as the water is only knee-deep or so," said 
Jerry Dixon, who lives near Conroe. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroe resident Duane Mayeux said he used his truck and a winch to rescue a 
man in a camping trailer who woke to find himself trapped by rising water. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was frantic. He had water up to the door of his trailer," Mayeux said. "If 
he hadn't woke up, he would have floated away." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no damage estimates, but state officials said up to five bridges 
were reported to have washed away near College Station, where up to 14 inches 
of rain has fallen since Sunday. College Station is about 90 miles northwest of 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 24 hours ending at midday Monday, nearly 18 inches of rain fell in 
Montgomery County. Other rainfall amounts in that period range from 10 inches 
to nearly 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are dealing with a massive amount of water in a confined area over a 
considerable period of time," Gov. Ann Richards said as she designated 16 
counties disaster areas, clearing the way for her to request federal 
assistance. "We've got every agency in that area plugged in and ready to assist 
in any way they can." 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency officials said heavy rains were expected to last through Monday 
night as a rain system from the Gulf of Mexico stalled over the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm system also drenched parts of Louisiana. From Saturday night to 
Monday morning, 11 inches fell in Chatham, La., and 10 inches fell at Negreet 
and Vixen.

NEW FINANCIAL QUESTIONS WORSEN NAACP PROBLEMS; FUNDING: THE LATEST TROUBLES 
STEM FROM CHARGES THAT ITS BOARD CHAIRMAN CHEATED ON EXPENSES. HE DENIES THE 
ALLEGATIONS AND CALLS FOR AN AUDIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the NAACP struggles to recover from the acrimonious firing of its executive 
director, the organization is confronting unexpected financial questions that 
are overshadowing the immediate need to find new leadership and a new 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 If the challenges are not met soon, according to NAACP supporters and outside 
experts, the financial burdens will snowball and threaten the existence of the 
organization itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent financial troubles stem from published allegations by syndicated 
columnist Carl Rowan suggesting that Board Chairman William F. Gibson may have 
"double-dipped" on as much as $500,000 on his expense account since 1986, when 
he assumed his position as chairman. Gibson has denied any impropriety and 
called for an independent audit of the organization's top officers to clear the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 NAACP members who pay dues and, more importantly, the philanthropic groups 
that make large grants, now express anxiety about whether their money will go 
toward advancing the organization's important work -- or be used foolishly or 
squandered by careless executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Some individuals and groups are withholding donations, creating a serious 
problem for an organization that is more than $3.5 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is rather unfortunate that this large, respected and national organization 
doesn't take its financial responsibilities more seriously," said Dan 
Borochoff, president of the American Institute of Philanthropy, a charity 
watchdog organization based in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The NAACP's sterling image as a crusading civil rights organization may have 
prevented members and donors from demanding that the organization manage money 
in accordance with strict financial accountability, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem in this field is that image counts for too much," Borochoff said. 
"Everyone should ask questions of these groups -- be it the NAACP, the United 
Way or the Boy Scouts -- because all of them have a responsibility to be 
accountable for the money that people give them." 
</P>
<P>
 Borochoff said that the philanthropy institute has attempted for the last 
three years to verify and rate the financial stability of more than 300 
charities. He said that the NAACP received an A, the highest mark, in 1992. But 
since then, the institute discovered $3 million in expenses reported to the New 
York State Office of Charities Registration that did not appear in its federal 
tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, he said, NAACP accountants were sloppy in their bookkeeping or, at 
worst, were deliberately misreporting expenses. "Otherwise, they would have 
reported their information accurately, and we wouldn't have found these rather 
large discrepancies." Borochoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a quarterly ranking issued last month, the institute rated the NAACP with a 
"question mark," indicating that it had not provided adequate or consistent 
records to the various monitoring agencies, including the Internal Revenue 
Service, state charities registration offices and other private auditing 
concerns that check records kept by charities. Borochoff said that NAACP 
executives have ignored the institute's requests for additional information or 
clarification. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent allegations of financial misdeeds have coincided with the gravest 
financial crisis in the NAACP's 85-year history. The group's debt now concerns 
longtime corporate and philanthropic donors so much that some have stopped 
giving money until they are satisfied that the NAACP has put in place stricter 
accounting controls. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the Ford Foundation, which helped ease the NAACP's last financial 
crisis in 1992 with a large donation, is withholding payment of a two-year 
$500,000 grant it promised the group. Julio Nunez, a spokesman at the Ford 
Foundation, declined to comment except to acknowledge that the grant has not 
been forwarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Top NAACP officials convened here last week, in part to plot a course aimed at 
reassuring the organization's supporters. Those supporters -- ranging from 
thousands of individual members who pay $15 annual dues to dozens of corporate 
and philanthropic foundations that contribute millions in grants -- provide the 
bulk of the organization's estimated $15-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with some NAACP officials attending the board meeting found no 
sense of panic concerning the financial problems and a belief that these 
troubles will pass as have others in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do what is necessary to insure the NAACP's survival," said Larry 
Carter, a board member and vice president of Norwest Financial Inc. in Des 
Moines, Iowa. "This is not the first time we've been in financial difficulty, 
and I doubt it will be the last." 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the NAACP voted to dismiss Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. as its executive 
director after many of its directors learned through media accounts that he had 
approved spending up to $333,000 of the organization's money to settle a 
threatened sexual harassment and wrongful discharge suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Rowan, a longtime NAACP member, has rocked the organization in a 
series of columns that have included calls for Gibson's resignation. Rowan 
wrote that documents he obtained suggest Gibson had "double-dipped" since 1986 
on his expense reports by requesting reimbursements of more than $500,000 in 
charges on his association-provided American Express card, including 
business-related airline travel, hotel expenses, car rentals and personal 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the NAACP has not announced any major reforms. Rather, the 
organization has announced new fund-raising programs with longstanding allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The board concluded business last weekend without passing judgment on Gibson, 
who had received an earlier vote of confidence from the board's executive 
committee, and voted to conduct the independent audit. Some NAACP leaders, 
including board members long opposed to Gibson's leadership, said that is not 
enough to restore confidence in the NAACP.

COURT CLEARS WAY FOR JAILING OF OPERATION RESCUE FOUNDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for the jailing of Operation 
Rescue founder Randy Terry on a contempt-of-court conviction that stemmed from 
an anti-abortion demonstrator showing Bill Clinton a fetus during the 1992 
Democratic National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices, without comment, left intact Terry's conviction and five-month 
jail sentence for disobeying a federal judge's injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry's sentence has been held in abeyance during his appeals, but Monday's 
action frees New York prosecutors to seek his incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry had urged the high court to rule that his contempt conviction was 
invalid because the New York state lawyers who had gained the injunction also 
prosecuted the contempt charges. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Democratic convention in New York City in July of 1992, state Atty. 
Gen. Robert Abrams obtained a federal court injunction barring Terry and 
Operation Rescue National from "presenting or confronting" then-Arkansas Gov. 
Clinton or then-Tennessee Sen. Al Gore "with any fetus or fetuses or fetal 
remains." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry was charged because, a day after the injunction was issued, Clinton was 
shown a fetus by an anti-abortion demonstrator. State prosecutors said Terry 
had been behind the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is Terry vs. U.S., 94-141.

JUDGE EXCUSES SIMPSON JUROR NO. 32 FROM CASE; COURTS: THE PASADENA WOMAN SOUGHT 
DISMISSAL BECAUSE OF 'UNDUE ATTENTION' OVER NUMBER THAT MATCHED THE ONE THE 
DEFENDANT WORE AS A FOOTBALL PLAYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The potential juror who drew O.J. Simpson's old football jersey number last 
month -- to the delight of the former athlete -- decided she did not want the 
publicity and asked Monday to be excused from serving during Simpson's 
double-murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito gave the 31-year-old Pasadena resident time 
to reconsider, but finally honored her request. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, an engineering researcher whose name never has been made public, 
told Ito she wanted out because "there is undue attention being drawn to me 
because of my juror number." 
</P>
<P>
 She later complained to reporters about a "Saturday Night Live" skit in which 
an Ito character winks at Juror No. 32. Family members and co-workers had 
badgered her about the identity of that juror, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman also objected to the release of extensive questionnaires that 
prospective jurors filled out on their attitudes about such things as race, 
crime and the specifics of the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media ruined it," she said. "There are some things in my life that are 
private." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson wore jersey number 32 throughout his celebrated football career with 
USC, the Buffalo Bills and the San Francisco 49ers. The first potential juror 
to undergo initial screening last month was Juror No. 32, a coincidence that 
led Ito to remark about an "omen" and Simpson to nod vigorously in agreement. 
On Monday, Ito said he would "retire" 32 as a number to identify potential 
jurors, jurors or alternates in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the June 12 slayings of his ex-wife Nicole 
Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Voir dire, or oral questioning of potential jurors, began last week and is 
expected to last at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ito postponed a decision on whether to sanction the prosecution for taking 
too long to send samples to scientific laboratories for DNA testing, depriving 
the defense of information in preparing its case. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cathy Randa, Simpson's longtime assistant, spent three hours before a grand 
jury, which was said earlier this month to have stopped taking testimony as 
part of an investigation of Simpson's friend Al Cowlings. Randa's lawyer 
accused prosecutors of harassing her. 
</P>
<P>
 * A shelter for battered women and children issued a "challenge" to the public 
to boycott Halloween costumes depicting Simpson or his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson masks and blood-splattered football jerseys have become hot sellers at 
costume stores as well as blond wigs for women who want to dress up as Nicole 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement released Monday includes a quote attributed to the dead woman's 
sister that describes such costumes as having "no redeeming value for our 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murder and domestic violence is no laughing matter," Denise Brown is quoted 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson in 1989 pleaded no contest to misdemeanor spousal abuse. Most of the 
members of the jury pool have indicated that they are aware of a taped call his 
ex-wife made to 911 in 1993 in which she said he had kicked in her door. 
</P>
<P>
 In court Monday, questions about domestic violence emerged again in the 
inquiries made of prospective jurors and led to the loss of one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 A 41-year-old Norwalk woman was excused after she said being in the courtroom 
"brought back past memories" of the 12 years of domestic violence she suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell from the tone of your voice you are very sincere," Ito told her 
before excusing her. 
</P>
<P>
 Voir dire is expected to continue today.

 Afour-day visit to Russia by Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, 
Prince Philip, ends here Thursday with a trip to the old imperial capital of 
St. Petersburg in the company of Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin.

<P>
 The queen arrived in Moscow on Monday and attended a performance that night of

THE WEEK AHEAD: MOSCOW; EX-SOVIETS CONVENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States meet in Moscow on Friday to 
discuss whether they want to create new economic ties within their loose 
grouping of countries. The CIS, formed by Russia, Ukraine and Belarus in 
December, 1991, as the Soviet Union collapsed, grew to encompass 12 former 
Soviet republics but has never bound their economies as closely as many leaders 
would like. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, proposed 
creating a "Eurasian Union" under the CIS umbrella, a body that could 
coordinate exports and create a "new economic order." The proposed union would 
also have a Parliament and guarantee freedom of movement among its member 
countries. The summit is not expected to move quickly on the idea.

CULTURE; EGYPT'S SLEEPING BEAUTY REVIVED AFTER 3,200 YEARS; RESTORING THE TOMB 
OF QUEEN NEFERTARI RAISES PROFOUND ISSUES OF ART AND HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Then, she was cherished across Egypt for her beauty and her brains. Now, the 
queen known to history as Nefertari is reaching across more than 3,000 years to 
raise some provocative questions about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 What in the world among the myriad relics of yesterday is worth conserving for 
coming generations? Save that building? Save this feather? And, since it's 
impossible to save everything, what should time and old age be allowed to have 
their way with? 
</P>
<P>
 The ancient queen is a jewel, worth keeping, because she illustrates these 
questions and their challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Nefertari, literally "the most beautiful," was the first wife and favorite 
consort of mighty Ramses II, who reigned 1290-1224 BC. She lived about 45 
years, circa 1300-1255 BC. He prized her companionship and counsel, loaded her 
with titles such as "mother and wife of god in life," and built her a 
spectacular tomb (before marrying their eldest daughter). 
</P>
<P>
 To speed his beloved's journey to eternity, Ramses stocked the tomb with 
jewels, amulets and funerary statuettes of black-painted sycamore; they were 
supposed to spring to life to serve Nefertari in the afterlife. Tomb stockers 
also thoughtfully left a queenly pair of corded sandals -- and the era's best 
wall paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgotten centuries ago, grave robbers looted the queen's burial chamber, her 
treasures and the mummy itself. But in 1904, Nefertari's resting place in the 
Valley of the Queens near Luxor was discovered for science by an Italian 
diplomat and a more-than-amateur archeologist named Ernesto Schiaparelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after new scholarship and six years of painstaking restoration, Nefertari 
and her burial chamber are subjects of a pioneer exhibition that opened here 
this month, blending artifacts with the theme of conservation and the high-tech 
wonderland of virtual reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The Louvre, the British Museum and the Egyptian Museum in Schiaparelli's 
native Turin have all contributed to a show whose artifacts range from an 
exquisite bezeled ring inscribed with the names of Ramses and Nefertari to a 
brooding, five-ton Colossus of Ramses. 
</P>
<P>
 In death, Nefertari, who lived one century and one dynasty later than the 
equally famous Nefertiti, reveals volumes about her life and times. The exhibit 
documents the checker-like solitaire game she fancied. It showcases her 
timeless beauty and the reverence she inspired three millennia ago as "the lady 
of fascination," "the sweetness of love," "the divine one." 
</P>
<P>
 The paintings are underscored with hieroglyphics. One depicts Nefertari's 
ritual acceptance by the gods of the afterlife, with one of them greeting her: 
"When you came to me, I gave you a place in the holy ground. May you appear in 
the sky like your father, Ra."  
</P>
<P>
 There is a more down-to-earth message in the exhibition, though. "This is the 
first time an exhibition has brought conservation into the life of an 
exhibition. We want to raise people's consciousness about conservation as an 
extension of art," said Mahasti Afshar, who assembled the show for the Getty 
Conservation Institute.  
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu-based Getty paid several million dollars for the restorations in 
Egypt by Italian experts as part of a worldwide program to find new ways of 
diagnosis and treatment that improve art conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really talking about conservation of the future, not the past," said 
Miguel Angel Corzo, director of the Getty institute. "With Nefertari, we are 
attracting people with the magic and mystery of Egypt and showing them the 
results of a complex conservation project. We are selling the message of the 
importance of conservation -- and conservation appropriate to the specific 
project." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nefertari burial chamber, as a case in point, is perhaps the most 
important of all the royal tombs in Egypt, Corzo said. Its wall paintings, rich 
in color and symbolism, tell the ancient Egyptian story of the passage of a 
soul to eternity. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiaparelli was appalled at the ravages of time and vandals on the art when 
he discovered the tomb. He introduced turn- of-the-century science to his 
studies, importing a photographer and a surveyor in a quest for accuracy. 
Merely opening the tomb upset a delicate atmospheric balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Corzo said that in a large Egyptian tomb nowadays, the typical daily presence 
of 3,500 visitors adds 11 gallons of water to the air. Over time, the increased 
humidity leaches salt from the limestone and damages painted plaster walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographic studies of Nefertari's tomb over the decades since Schiaparelli's 
photographer took the first pictures show dramatic and accelerating 
deterioration of the art. Italian specialists, who are among the world's top 
restorers, did an emergency intervention to stop flaking, cracking and falling 
plaster, and then undertook systematic conservation of the tomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a 3,000-year-old work of art that is once again strikingly bold 
and fresh-looking. But the restorers added not a drop of paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conservation must respect the historical integrity of a piece without adding 
anything. It must be a minimalist intervention that does nothing irreversible," 
said Afshar, the man who assembled the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Nefertari's legacy might have been lost entirely without restoration. But in 
presenting the results of its rescue, the exhibit also underlines a modern 
dilemma: can-do technology versus tight resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, the works of art that were saved were those that survived 
misadventures like decay, looting and earthquakes. Today, we have the 
possibility of saving everything," Corzo said. "Books, feathers, photographs, 
buildings, leather, silk. Techniques are available for all of them -- but never 
the resources." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Czech Republic, Corzo noted, there are 40,000 architectural monuments. 
Which among them to save? If you had a collection of 45,000 old photographs, 
would you save all of them? Just the best? 
</P>
<P>
 "We are poised to decide how we want future generations to look at the past," 
Corzo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Decisions are not easy. At a major archeological site, there may be as many 
conflicting interests as there are parties with a stake: archeologists, 
scholars, conservators, government ministries of tourism and finance, people 
living around the site and those making money from it. 
</P>
<P>
 There are trade-offs: Nefertari's tomb, long beloved of visitors, is now 
safely restored. But it is also closed to visitors who once streamed through in 
awe. Egyptian authorities are conferring with atmospheric monitoring machines 
to decide how many people could be allowed in without triggering run-amok 
deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
 There are uncertainties: Nefertari's tomb ranks high on any list of monuments 
worth saving. But if Muslim fundamentalism were to force the interest of some 
future Egyptian government away from cultural preservation, the money spent on 
Nefertari might, in retrospect, have been better spent on some other worthy 
rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 There are challenges: To give people an idea of the scope and majesty of the 
tomb, Schiaparelli's team made a breathtaking one-tenth scale model that is 
among the current show's exhibits. The model was, effectively, virtual reality, 
circa 1910. Its modern counterpart at the show here is a computer-driven tour 
of the tomb -- virtual reality, circa 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cutting-edge exhibition fashioned by ENEL, Italy's power and light 
company, visitors stroll about the tomb with the aid of a joystick. Walk in, 
turn corners, raise and lower your gaze, focus on individual paintings and 
symbols. It is an eerie, simultaneous encounter with the Egyptian otherworld 
and the computer next-world. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one of Nefertari's come-from-the-past lessons may be that while it is 
not possible to conserve everything, technology may make it possible for 
curious souls in the next century to realistically savor shards of yesterday 
through marvels of electronic conservation now glimmering on tomorrow's 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nefertari, Light of Egypt" is at the Palazzo Ruspoli, Via del Corso 118, 
until Feb. 19, 1995. The exhibit is open daily from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and 
until 10 p.m. on Saturdays. Tickets are about $6.75.

NATIONAL AGENDA; CHINA FRETS OVER INFLATION; LEADERS TRUMPET THEIR CONCERN BUT 
SEEM POWERLESS TO HALT THE RISING PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They were unlikely protesters -- not idealistic students nor brooding 
intellectuals nor angry young workers, simply unhappy pensioners whose incomes 
were not keeping up with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired steel mill employees who staged a sit-in outside a factory gate in 
the central Chinese city of Wuhan this spring were hardly the sort of people 
who could bring down a government. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps for that reason, rather than face arrest, they won: The factory agreed 
to boost their pensions from 250 yuan (about $30) a month to a bit more than 
300 yuan (about $36). But these days in China -- amid an economic boom that is 
benefiting most people but leaving hundreds of millions of others behind -- 
that isn't enough to live on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically use our entire pensions on food because we can't afford to buy 
anything else," said one beneficiary of the protest, a retired steelworker 
named Zhang. "We can't really live with our available money. We have a nephew 
who earns more, and he gives us spending money every month to help us get by." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years after the People's Liberation Army crushed pro-democracy protests 
fueled partly by outrage over rising prices, the specter of inflation is again 
at the top of China's public concerns. Not since summer, 1988 -- when 
panic-buying of consumer items such as refrigerators and televisions swept 
shelves bare in cities across this nation -- has the problem been so severe. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation alone seems unlikely to lead to an explosion of social unrest, given 
the Communist Party's continuing ability to impose police-state controls or 
call upon the army to crush any disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 But with 90-year-old senior leader Deng Xiaoping in gradually failing health, 
China could, at any time, face a destabilizing succession crisis. Serious 
inflation would add to the uncertainties in any post-Deng power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Top leaders of China's successor generation are trumpeting their concern about 
inflation but seem incapable of taking any measures to control it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prices are rising fast and inflationary pressure is still too big," Premier 
Li Peng admitted in a recent speech, published on the front page of the 
official People's Daily. "A considerable number of state-owned enterprises are 
in difficulty, and at some inefficient firms the real income of workers is 
falling. Parts of the country are plagued by crime and social disorder. . . . 
The living standards of hundreds of millions of peasants has a direct impact on 
the entire nation's economic development and social stability." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, controlling inflation must be the government's "most important task . . 
. during the second half of this year," Li said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fears of Chinese rulers have been stoked by statistics showing that annual 
inflation in major cities is running at 27%. Urban food prices this summer were 
up 32% from a year earlier, while grain prices soared 58%. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for example, half a kilogram of eggs -- 10 large eggs or a dozen 
smaller ones -- sold for 2.40 yuan (28 cents) in Beijing; now they cost 3.30 
yuan (39 cents). Broccoli has jumped to 3.18 yuan (37 cents) a pound from 2.27 
yuan (27 cents) a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of this year, pork, the most important meat in the Chinese 
diet, has jumped to 7.28 yuan (86 cents) a pound, up from 4.55 yuan (54 cents). 
</P>
<P>
 Concern about the social impact of price increases is chilling plans to force 
state-owned industries to face fiercer market competition, though squeezing 
greater efficiency out of poorly run factories would be a key step toward 
solving underlying problems. Authorities seem to be afraid that inflation and 
industrial restructuring make too volatile a mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of workers . . . life is very very hard, especially now, when a lot 
of enterprises are closing down or reforming and they are laying off a lot of 
people," said Zhang, the onetime steelworker who moved to Beijing from Wuhan 
after retiring. "I think the government should be very careful about what they 
do to the workers of China." 
</P>
<P>
 After the bloody 1989 crackdown on the student-led Tian An Men Square 
protests, the government "covered it up pretty well, and they scared them" into 
silence, Zhang said. "But if they infuriate the workers, there will be no 
stopping them." 
</P>
<P>
 But many others in Beijing believe that however angry people may get over 
price increases, there is nothing they can do. Most people's incomes are also 
growing a bit faster than inflation, and consumers further benefit from 
availability of an ever-growing variety of goods. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, when similar rates of inflation caused a panic, China was emerging 
from almost four decades of stable prices. But now people are accustomed to 
seeing both wages and prices go up. And for ordinary people in Beijing, the key 
lesson of Tian An Men Square seems to be that challenging the government on 
anything is a dangerous exercise in futility. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "If you try to defend your rights -- in this case, consumer rights -- you may 
be branded an ultra-leftist, an ultra-rightist, or something else extreme," a 
30-year-old tour guide said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single person in this country is under the Communist Party's control. 
The Chinese people are like bricks in a wall. When you're building it, you 
stack them up, one by one. If there are some that are too long or too short or 
misshapen, they'll be banged into the right shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his bitterness and cynicism -- or perhaps because of it -- this man 
takes a long-term view about rising prices, saying: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure inflation is a problem in every developing country in the world. 
Whatever problems this society has right now are natural for China." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhai Huiru, 38, a teacher at a polytechnic school with a salary slightly more 
than 500 yuan ($59) per month, is typical of those managing to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure most people are numb to all these price hikes, just as I am," Zhai 
said. "It's quite hard for me to make ends meet with my salary. I use it all to 
buy food -- no clothes, no hairdos, just food. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I have to say that living standards now are higher than in the 1970s. All 
you need is money, and you can buy anything you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhai's way out is to take on extra jobs, which she said is how most people 
cope with inflation. "I also teach at night school, and sometimes edit other 
people's papers," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers, noting that people in urban areas have accepted the inflation 
of the last year with very little open protest, wonder why the top leadership 
is jaw-boning about it now. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see (Premier) Li Peng and (Vice Premier) Zhu Rongji on television, and 
they're so obsessed with this," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do they talk so much? If you have a problem with inflation, the central 
government shouldn't talk so much about it, they should do something about it. 
It's not the kind of thing you can appeal to the masses to solve. . . . I 
suppose they want to signal that they're trying to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some key steps that have been announced to fight inflation include imposition 
of temporary price controls on selected products, a ban on new 
government-implemented price increases for the rest of this year, and 
exhortations to state-run wholesalers to do a better job of purchasing pork and 
vegetables, with the goal of guaranteeing reasonably priced supplies to the 
urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But with more than half of the average person's consumption now supplied 
through essentially free markets, the impact of these measures may prove 
negligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Top leaders thus seem to be "very afraid" that inability to stop inflation 
"may lead to social unrest," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It led the KMT (Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party) to fall, and helped 
cause (the protests of) 1989. But the public -- at least in the cities -- has 
grown more accommodating. The danger is in the countryside." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Government talk about battling inflation may also be related to maneuvering 
over the post-Deng succession, the diplomat said, noting: "I think all of them 
are playing politics -- short-term, positional politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Top leaders may also be nervous because they know that, despite their 
continued ability to crack down on open opposition, the government faces a 
profound loss of public respect. 
</P>
<P>
 In prosperous Guangdong province, adjacent to Hong Kong, many people no longer 
bother to hide their contempt for the Communist Party and most of the nation's 
top leaders. When a visitor mentioned to his taxi driver that early this year 
Li had said he aimed to hold inflation below 10%, the driver's response was 
open and direct: "He's a dirty liar." 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard for outsiders to get a full picture of what is happening in the 
countryside. But scattered reports of peasant riots occasionally filter in from 
the provinces. And many Chinese have learned to read between the lines of the 
official media. 
</P>
<P>
 State-run television "shows programs about the burdens on peasants," noted 
Shang, a middle-aged employee of a Chinese-foreign joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time when a party leader somewhere in Shaanxi (a poor northwestern 
province) eats dumplings with peasants in their houses, it means something 
serious has happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the overall increased prosperity of today, some people say their 
living standards were, in some ways, higher during the days of Chairman Mao 
Tse-tung, when prices were controlled and egalitarianism was the official 
ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This country has become more and more unfair," complained Wu Li, 55, a 
mathematician who said he earns 400 yuan (about $47) a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those nouveau riche eat lobster and crab, while we cannot even afford 
high-class vegetables. I remember in the 1960s and 1970s I could eat a chicken 
or fish every week, but now for every meal we're on a tight budget." 
</P>
<P>
 But most people consider any talk of "the good old days" to be nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 "During Mao's days, the prices were stable," acknowledged Liu Yumei, 60, a 
grandmother who lives with her son's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never changed for 30 years. But so what? Everything was rationed. There 
was nothing in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could you imagine having meat every meal? Could you have so many kinds of 
vegetables to choose in the winter? People are always complaining about price 
rises. But no one's living standard is truly falling." 
</P>

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; TURKEY'S FOREIGN MINISTER LOOKS TO NEIGHBORS FIRST; MUMTAZ 
SOYSAL MAY REORIENT A COUNTRY DELICATELY BALANCED BETWEEN THE WEST AND NATIONS 
SUCH AS IRAQ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGH POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a twinkle in his eye, Mumtaz Soysal, Turkey's new foreign minister, 
fenced with reporters questioning his personal impact on the relationship 
between the Western powers and his own country, NATO's strategic ally on the 
border with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 How did he define his policy? Pro-Saddam Hussein? Isolationist? Nationalist? 
Opportunist? Was he a dove? A hawk? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a bird," was all the 65-year-old professor would volunteer. He 
turned to welcome more guests to the terrace of his official mansion. It has 
one of the best views of Turkey's capital city, appropriate for the enigmatic 
man now dominating the country's political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Soysal may not outline the details of his policies, but Turkish commentators 
have homed in on his keynote goal of a "foreign policy with character . . . 
with honor." Some believe it may help reorient a country delicately balanced 
between Europe and the Middle East, between Russia and the Mediterranean, even 
between Christianity and Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are riding for a fall. . . . Turkey has become very successful in 
establishing policies that will isolate it from the world," wrote Sedat 
Sertoglu, foreign affairs commentator for Sabah, the country's largest daily. 
Others have called Soysal a dinosaur, dangerous, even a scourge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sertoglu has bitterly criticized Soysal about a trip he made to New York a few 
months before being named foreign minister on July 27. There he acted as a paid 
lobbyist for the Iraqi government, urging that the U.N. embargo on Iraq be 
lifted. Soysal says he has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turkish interest may not coincide point by point with the interests of our 
traditional allies. . . . NATO is not anymore the backbone of Turkish foreign 
policy," the soft-spoken, French-educated minister said in a rare interview. 
"The West thought that, by carrying on the sanctions, they may topple the 
regime in Baghdad. We have other aims, Kurdish affairs, the welfare of the 
region, our commerce." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soysal's "neighbors first" policy has yet to reverse decades of Turkish policy 
anchored in the Western alliance. During the latest Persian Gulf crisis, Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller criticized Iraq and reaffirmed Ankara's traditional 
commitment to U.N. resolutions on Iraq and cooperation with the United States. 
But Soysal remained silent and questioned whether Hussein had really massed 
troops on the border. 
</P>
<P>
 He has come to symbolize the cracks opening up in Turkey's relationship with 
the West on a range of issues, including the situations in Iraq, Cyprus and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, negotiations on Turkey's aim to achieve a customs union 
with Europe by 1996 and Russia's right to intervene in the Caucasus and Central 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Soysal's supporters argue that a correction was necessary after the strongly 
pro-American and pro-Western policies of Turkish leader Turgut Ozal, who died 
in April, 1993, after a decade in which he opened up an introverted, isolated 
Turkey to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The new tone in policy also rides a strengthening current of nationalist and 
Islamist sentiment in Turkey, a gut feeling than runs from the man in the 
street to an informal, cross-party conservative bloc in Parliament. Its 
adherents believe that Turkey has been unfairly rebuffed by Europe, that the 
West has betrayed the Muslims of Bosnia and, against all public evidence, that 
Europeans favor carving out an independent state for the Middle East's 20 
million Kurds, half of whom live in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Soysal, a constitutional lawyer jailed as a left-winger after the 1971 coup 
and later a human rights activist with Amnesty International, says he believes 
that ethnic Kurdish aspirations could be managed by giving limited cultural and 
local government rights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He has used his nationalist agenda to block virtually single-handedly Ciller's 
ambitions to privatize Turkey's state-dominated economy, even though 
privatization is a major plank of the International Monetary Fund-backed 
economic stabilization program of the government. A member of the old-fashioned 
Social Democrats, a junior partner in Turkey's ruling coalition, Soysal favors 
old-style "national planning" and wants to block foreign investment that has 
"the sole aim of profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Such talk might sound old-fashioned, but it is associated with a new 
self-assertion by Turkey. One of Soysal's first moves decreed that citizens of 
a dozen countries, including the United States, will now have to stand in line 
at border posts to buy symbolic visas in order to enter Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bravo Ankara," trumpeted a nationalist headline in the daily newspaper 
Hurriyet. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Ankara's rejection in August of a 10% slice in Turkey's U.S. 
military aid loans for fiscal 1995, which would have been worth a total $363 
million. Turkey was angry that Congress had made the $36.3-million portion 
conditional upon a State Department report on Turkey's progress on human rights 
and Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most important subject for the United States has been Turkey's 
attitude toward Iraq, where Turkey has become increasingly frustrated by 
Washington's insistence on maintaining a tough arm-lock on Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is simply a wrong perception that sanctions to the end against Iraq will 
bring compromise. We have to accept that Saddam Hussein is there," Soysal told 
reporters. "We have been loyal allies for decades. Our policy will be to put 
our neighbors first. The West has to trust us." 
</P>
<P>
 Soysal has a point. In a speech to 400 influential Turks last month, former 
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger noted that "in every postwar crisis 
Turkey has proved a reliable friend." But Turkey does not want to be left 
behind as Russia, France and China all quietly court Baghdad, once one of 
Turkey's top three trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
 A 60-member Turkish business delegation left for Baghdad in August to help 
revive contacts. Ankara vocally took up the case for lifting the Iraqi embargo. 
Foreign access through Turkey to northern Iraq, the Kurdish-populated, 
U.N.-protected "no-fly" zone, was made subject to strict new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "America's ability to pressure Turkey to execute anti-Iraq policies is 
waning," crowed the Baghdad newspaper Babel. Even during the current crisis, 
Iraq's ambassador to Ankara has talked glowingly about how "the new spring in 
our relationship continues in all its beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has been worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "In each case, the Turks are saying, we are not proposing sanctions-busting, 
we will hold the line. But there is an accumulation of issues to discuss," said 
a U.S. official before a mid-September visit to Ankara by Assistant Secretary 
of State Peter Tarnoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey controls the main access route to the ethnic Kurds of northern Iraq. 
The U.S.-led Western air force known as Operation Provide Comfort that protects 
the Kurds also depends on six-month renewals of its mandate by the Turkish 
Parliament. Soysal said he gave no assurances to Tarnoff about the scheduled 
vote this December to extend the mandate during what he said was a "very frank" 
exchange of views. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to normalize the situation . . . whereby Provide Comfort might 
not be necessary," the Turkish minister explained. "A comfortable situation is 
(one where) Saddam is not likely to attack his Kurds and, because of that, the 
Kurds are not likely to cross the (Turkish) border." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Turkish bureaucrat underlined the same basic guarantee. Turkey, he 
said, would never allow Saddam Hussein back into the northern stretch of his 
country without agreement from the two main leaders of the Iraqi Kurds, if only 
to avoid a repeat of the post-Gulf War refugee crisis when 1.5 million Iraqi 
Kurds fled across the borders of Turkey and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey has not got much from Iraq in return for its policy except egg on its 
face. Even before the latest Gulf crisis, Baghdad had undermined Turkey's 
successful bid for U.S. approval to flush the Iraq-Turkey oil pipeline, rusting 
away under the U.N. sanctions ever since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Baghdad regime refused to agree to resuming its oil exports under the 
terms demanded by the United Nations: that the proceeds go toward humanitarian 
aid, with international supervision of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Turkish and Western sources said Hussein's government took a hard line because 
it believed that it could wring more concessions from Soysal. "Turkey is in 
danger of giving the wrong signal to Iraq," a senior Western envoy said. "It is 
that if you hang tough, all this embargo will collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Parliament of Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus, angered by a 
European Community ban on its exports, also took advantage of the elevation of 
Soysal, a staunch friend, to harden its negotiating position. Turkey had little 
choice but to follow suit with Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions with Greece also rose during August when a bout of war fever gripped 
the Turkish press. The fighting talk aimed to make Athens accept that any 
attempt to enlarge its territorial waters in the Aegean Sea would be taken by 
Turkey as a cause for war. Some Turkish commentators went so far as plotting 
possible invasion routes into the territory of their North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasan Cemal, a senior commentator for the daily Sabah, expressed concern that 
the rhetoric had run too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be more reasonable," he wrote, "to try to secure external support in 
Turkey's fight against these problems rather than opening up new fronts."

MARKET SCENE; GERMAN BOOKWORMS BOW TO NEW MEDIA; CD-ROMS AND OTHER COMPUTER 
TECHNOLOGY CLAIM A MAJOR ROLE AT FRANKFURT'S ANNUAL BOOK FAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time Erik Schylander showed up at the Frankfurt Book Fair to peddle 
CD-ROM-equipped computers for the Dutch company Philips Electronics, in 1986, 
the world publishing Establishment treated him like, well, a hardware salesman 
at a book fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said to go away," said Schylander, Philips' general manager of strategy 
and standards. "And I said, 'I'll come back in 10 years to see if I can get a 
corner.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take 10 years, and Philips grabbed more than a corner this year at 
the 46th annual Frankfurt fair, where electronic media claimed about 97,000 
square feet in a hall of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 But while no one showed Schylander the door, the response from book lovers was 
still something less than a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people walking around and looking are friendly," Schylander volunteered 
in explanation of his reception. "Um, the rest is a question of understanding. 
It's a cultural problem among publishers, to understand and use the new media." 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft, one of the largest U.S. producers of CD-ROM titles, set up a 
mini-theater, a bank of computer terminals and a coffee bar to friendly up the 
crowd. The center of attention was CD-ROM -- Compact Disc/Read Only Memory -- 
the technology that puts information and games at your fingertip, or your 
mouse's paw tip. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about people venturing out into a new frontier of publishing," 
said Microsoft marketing manager Mitchell Wolfson. "A lot feel nervous, 
apprehensive. They feel they are being forced. And they are not sure what their 
next step is." 
</P>
<P>
 The computer guys hastened to assure their colleagues in traditional 
publishing that CD-ROM, CD-I and the other elements of 21st-Century multimedia 
are complements to books, not competitors. They are television to radio, CNN to 
newspapers. Different markets, the computer experts asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You could see pain on the faces of those who speak of a "special feeling" for 
books. Cozy up in bed with a CD-ROM? Thumb through a first edition of Grolier 
Multimedia Encyclopedia? Feel a freshly minted disk? These were people who 
still spell byte with an i . 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the old way of printing and making books," said Claus-Peter von 
Nottbeck, a Cologne publisher who has put out 25 books on the natural and 
political sciences. "You are losing a lot of old traditions." 
</P>
<P>
 German entrepreneurs generally are not known to leap to the forefront of new 
technologies. In electronic publishing, they're about five years behind their 
American counterparts, said Torsten Brunn of Boersenverein des Deutschen 
Buchhandels, Germany's central organization of booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the publishers and booksellers roaming the aisles of the high-tech hall 
were also practical sorts. They use mobile telephones and pocket calculators, 
work on computers and recognize that people around the world are spending less 
time each day with books. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the year, Germans will own an estimated 1.5 million computers 
with CD-ROM capability -- 2.5 million by the end of 1995. Even Von Nottbeck 
sees himself going electronic in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I have to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic media made their debut at the 1993 Frankfurt fair, and the 
number of firms exhibiting earlier this month had more than doubled since then, 
to about 230. Though still only a fraction of the fair's 8,600 exhibitors, they 
made a splash in the German press. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new media is there. We cannot talk it away," said fair director Peter 
Weidhaas. But the printed book, he insisted, "will not lose its importance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though fair officials gave the electronic folks their own place this year, the 
plan, according to Microsoft's Wolfson, is to integrate them back into the main 
halls. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we move into the mainstream in the next three or four years, we'll be 
alongside the books," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, they already acted pretty mainstream, serving wine and cheese over 
electronic dictionaries. The aisles of the electronic media hall were packed 
with booksellers and bookworms and salespeople hawking electronic 
encyclopedias, medical texts and on-screen maps. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main question asked by publishers is, does the CD-ROM replace books? We 
don't think so. But the market share of CD-ROMs will grow," said. Annette 
Damerow of Bertelsmann Electronic Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gertraud Griepke, electronic media manager of the German science and medical 
book publisher Springer, said just 1.7% of her company's production is 
electronic. She expects that to jump to 10% in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Griepke said consumers don't have to understand how their electronic media 
work, just how to operate them. "I don't know what my phone is doing when it 
rings or what my car is doing when I switch on the engine. I just know it goes 
grr-r-r-r and I can drive it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griepke and other electronic publishers said traditional publishers are 
nervous about electronic media because of a shortage of good developers in 
Germany and because the software is easy to duplicate, robbing them of 
potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said authors and consumers want full multimedia capability, such as 
beating hearts in medical books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our authors are forcing us to go into this," she said.

PROPERTY VALUES: A BURNING DEBATE ON CHIMNEYS; IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET EASY 
ANSWERS ABOUT THE HIDDEN DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the simple math of quake-damaged chimney repairs that opens the door to 
possible fraud, or at least simple mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 A chimney that needs some minor repairs could cost only a few hundred dollars, 
but if that same chimney is deemed structurally damaged and must be rebuilt 
from scratch, it could cost $6,000 or more. Given the high cost and the fact 
that insurance companies, homeowners andchimney inspectors might have different 
opinions over the same "damaged" chimney, you confront the likelihood of 
conflicting opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider one family in Woodland Hills. Their home suffered major damage from 
the Northridge quake and, early on, a masonry company representative examined 
their chimney and said that, with the exception of a couple of loose bricks at 
the top, everything was fine. That repair was made for $200. 
</P>
<P>
 Months passed. Then, after seeing so many neighbors forced to tear down their 
chimneys, the worried family hired another inspector to take a look. He did a 
smoke test in the chimney, blocking off both ends, and eventually a small haze 
seeped into the living room. His verdict: The chimney was badly cracked and 
needed to be rebuilt from scratch. The cost? $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 So the family brought back the first mason who had checked the chimney months 
before. This time the mason, at their insistence, did an even more elaborate 
inspection with a special video camera (cost $250) and came up with the same 
verdict as last spring: Your chimney is fine, leave it alone. So they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, insurance companies are often confused by chimney damage. Some are 
still sorting out the chimneys for which they'll pay merely to repair (versus 
replace), said Tom Cordova, spokesman for State Farm Insurance Cos. in Westlake 
Village. "After the earthquake we were replacing some chimneys that could be 
repaired," he said. "Now we have learned more."  
</P>
<P>
 In some cases where repair is possible, though, State Farm will pay for 
replacement as a way to avoid future losses from another quake, Cordova said.  
</P>
<P>
 As insurance companies pay out more claims, Cordova said, it's becoming easier 
to spot overpriced bids. Most chimney replacement bids, however, are staying 
within the range of $6,000 to $8,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of changes this fall in the Los Angeles building and safety 
requirements, most of the chimneys in the San Fernando Valley are being rebuilt 
with metal framing and a metal flue (instead of the old brick- or clay-interior 
chimneys), King said. A homeowner who wants a brick or a clay structure needs 
to file special plans with the city, drafted by a civil or structural engineer. 
None are needed for a metal-framed chimney that merely gets a brick veneer. 
Wood-framed, versus metal-framed, chimneys are allowed by the city only for 
chimneys built from the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, it's best to get several opinions before doing any work. 
</P>
<P>
 There are basically three methods for inspecting a chimney, explained Mark 
Lichterman, owner of the Flue Bug Chimney Sweep in Woodland Hills: 
</P>
<P>
 * Visual inspections involve looking at the so-called interior firebox and 
searching for any cracks or seams between it and the back wall of the 
fireplace. Outside, a visual inspection should include a look for any breaks 
between the side wall and the back wall of the chimney and for any cracks in 
masonry or mortar. Horizontal cracks are generally more ominous than vertical 
cracks because of the chimney's weight distribution, Lichterman said. Finally, 
look for proper flashing between the chimney and roof. Lichterman said he 
charges about $40 to $60 for a visual inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Smoke inspections are done by sealing the top of the chimney and the firebox 
opening with tape and plastic. A pallet is then ignited to create smoke. If any 
of it leaks, you could have significant cracks somewhere in your chimney. Odor 
is also added to the smoke so that seepage is easier to detect. Another problem 
with this test is that, done on a cold day, certain cracks may have contracted 
and the test will show no problems. Expect to pay between $150 and $250 for the 
smoke inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Video inspections are the newest way to check a chimney. Basically, a 
chimney inspector places a video camera down your chimney and looks for cracks 
or other irregularities. Some claim this is the best method by far, and a few 
insurance companies are requiring video tests before paying on a claim. There 
are others who remain unconvinced about the video test, especially for 
brick-interior chimneys where harmless water damage may appear on the video to 
be serious earthquake damage. The cost of the inspection is about $150 to $250. 
It is also advisable to clean your chimney before a video inspection. This adds 
another $75 to $150 to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Improper inspections can lead homeowners to tear down chimneys that could have 
been saved, Lichterman charged.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen a lot of chimneys condemned, and I don't know for the life of me 
why," he said. "There are millions of dollars being spent needlessly."  
</P>
<P>
 Lichterman advises homeowners to get several opinions before tearing down a 
chimney. He said it's best, too, to retain an inspector who does not also do 
repair and replacement work. Otherwise, he said, there is a possible conflict 
of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Gardner, president of Fiddler on the Roof Chimney Service in Canoga 
Park, doesn't agree with Lichterman. "The people who really know fireplaces are 
the people who also do repair," he said. "Someone who does only inspections 
doesn't have a vested interest, but he does not have the same experience as 
someone who does repairs and replacements." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner does inspections, repairs and replacements and notes that people are 
now taking their time and getting multiple estimates.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a panic situation that existed after the earthquake," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But homeowners can expect to pay a bit more than they would have a year ago, 
Gardner conceded. He has a 10-week backlog of work and is charging an average 
of $500 more for his major jobs. Rebuilding a chimney ranges from $3,000 to 
$10,000, he said, depending on the size of the project. Affixing a new 
metal-framed chimney and metal flue to the top of an existing firebox averages 
about $5,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the complexity of meeting the requirements of the city of Los 
Angeles. A building permit is required for chimney repair work with a valuation 
of $201 or more, and several inspections may be needed, said Bill King, chief 
building inspector for the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety in Van 
Nuys.  
</P>
<P>
 Some homeowners are opting for an initial inspection by the department to 
determine what kind of damage the chimney may have sustained from the January 
earthquake. King recommends, however, that property owners pay for a more 
thorough private inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 When work actually commences on rebuilding a chimney, King said, there needs 
to be an initial inspection of any transitions between the old firebox and the 
new chimney structure. Then there needs to be a second framing inspection. If 
the chimney is being stuccoed, there needs to be a third lathing inspection of 
the paper and chicken wire around the framing. Then there is a final 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 For a long while, many chimney repair jobs were being delayed by a long wait 
for multiple inspections. "We weren't doing that well," King admitted. Now, his 
department has hired another 35 inspectors who are working evenings and 
Saturdays. Close to 95% of inspections are being made within 24 hours of a 
phone call, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring whom to hire for your chimney repair work isn't easy either. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies say they are licensed, but that often means only that they have 
a city business license, said Andrew Davidson, owner of Davidson's Chimney 
Sweep in Oxnard. Some contractors claim to be insured, he said, but what they 
really mean is that they are insured through the homeowner's insurance policy. 
Some ads tout being certified. This usually -- but not always -- means that the 
repair person is certified by the National Chimney Sweep Guild after taking a 
two-day course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't look for the cheapest price," Davidson advised, and ask lots of 
questions.

DOING BUSINESS; CANADA MAKES WAVES WITH FISHING RESTRICTIONS; FACED WITH 
FALLING CATCHES, OFFICIALS SEIZE FOREIGN VESSELS IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS AND 
LOBBY FOR QUOTAS TO PRESERVE TURBOT AND OTHER SPECIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This has been a busy year for Canada's fish police. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by a youthful, pugnacious fisheries minister named Brian Tobin, Canada has 
fashioned a sort of gunboat diplomacy in pursuit of protecting its dwindling 
fish stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy has pushed Canada into a worldwide leadership position on the 
conservation issue, but it has also brought the country into conflict with the 
United States on two coasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Coast Guard and Fisheries Department ships and planes now patrol the 
Atlantic beyond the country's 200-mile limit. Occasionally they seize 
foreign-flag boats -- including U.S.-based vessels -- they believe are poaching 
on Canadian fish, even when the vessels are in international waters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pacific Northwest, Ottawa and Washington failed to reach agreement on 
revised salmon quotas this summer, and Canada responded by levying steep new 
fees on American salmon fishermen passing through Canadian waters. When Sen. 
Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska) complained, Tobin dismissed him as "a gnat." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Tobin, 39, sometimes seems to wave a privateer's cutlass in one hand, 
he carries the diplomat's briefcase in the other. He lobbies hard at the United 
Nations and other international forums for tougher restrictions on taking 
depleted fishing stocks -- and not without success. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization, which sets regional 
fishing quotas for Canada, Europe and other North Atlantic nations, bowed to 
Canada's urgings and for the first time limited turbot catches. 
</P>
<P>
 There were suggestions that, behind the scenes, Tobin implied that Canada 
would take unilateral action if the international group did nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been compelled to be assertive, some would say aggressive, because the 
alternative is to, with our eyes wide open, preside over the destruction of the 
(fishing) resource," Tobin said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 His apocalyptic rhetoric and damn-the-torpedoes diplomatic style is founded in 
the near-collapse of Canada's Atlantic fishery, which has wrenched the soul out 
of his native province of Newfoundland and fissured the economy throughout 
Canada's East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 In Canada's deteriorating fishing industry, and the country's thrashing 
attempts to save it, are lessons for the rest of the world. For, from the Bay 
of Biscay off France to the disputed Kuril Islands near Japan, fishermen are in 
conflict. In the United States, salmon fisheries in Washington and cod 
fisheries in New England have been closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many conditions underlie the spiraling problem -- environmental degradation, 
enhanced fishing technology, climatic changes, even an increase in the seal 
population. But it is perhaps most succinctly summed up by fisherman Lawrence 
(Laurie) Sullivan, speaking in the lilt typical of this part of Newfoundland: 
"There's too many boats and too few fish. That's the way I look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a July report by the Worldwatch Institute, a nonprofit, 
international environmental research group based in Washington, the catch in 
every fishery in the world outside the Indian Ocean is in decline. 
</P>
<P>
 In three areas of the Atlantic and one in the Pacific, the harvest is down 
more than 30% since its peak year. Worldwide, the marine catch has dropped 5% 
since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The continued decline not only portends further conflicts among fishermen and 
governments, but increased unemployment in marine communities, higher prices 
for consumers, a disappearing source of low-cost protein in the Third World and 
the destruction of traditional fishing cultures, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these problems have already taken hold in Canada's Atlantic provinces, 
particularly in Newfoundland at the continent's eastern edge. 
</P>
<P>
 When Italian-born explorer John Cabot entered the waters near St. John's under 
the English flag in 1497, the cod schools were so thick his men had trouble 
rowing their longboats through them. By 1992, the fish were so few that Canada, 
in a desperate effort to preserve the species, declared a moratorium on cod 
fishing off Newfoundland's Grand Bank.  
</P>
<P>
 The province fell into an economic depression from which it has never 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates of unemployed fishermen and related workers run as high as 50,000 in 
Newfoundland and neighboring provinces. One in four Newfoundlanders is on 
welfare or unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has spent more than $1 billion in Canadian funds (about $730 
million U.S.) on relief and compensation and promised $1.9 billion ($1.39 
billion U.S.) more over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fishery ever comes back here, it is estimated that there will only be 
enough work for half as many people as were employed in fishing, processing and 
related trades when the 1992 moratorium went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd have to be overly optimistic to say the future of the overall industry 
is anything but bleak," said Earle McCurdy, president of the Fishermen, Food 
and Allied Workers Union here. "In the long haul, I can't see the amount of 
fish we had available in the late '80s again in my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The decline has not hit everyone in the Atlantic region equally. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobster fishermen, for example, enjoyed years of record catches before there 
was a dip this year. The crab season this summer was also strong here. The 
result is a certain capriciousness of prosperity, depending on what kind of 
fishing license and equipment an individual had when the fishery went into 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan -- with a 45-foot oceangoing boat, a variety of licenses and a 
working wife -- has survived nicely, he acknowledged. He will fish crab and 
scallops this year. Last year, it was tuna and flounder. At age 36, he has been 
fishing for 20 years, and, as is typical here, his family has fished "as far 
back as I know." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged a certain sense of guilt that his business has survived when 
so many others have not, but then, turning toward the sea, noted: "You don't 
get nothing out of that ocean easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Williams, baseball cap pushed back on his head, weather-worn clothes 
stretched over his barrel chest, chain-smokes cigarettes down to the filter in 
the kitchen of his small home in Allendale, Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
 With the lobster season over, he will tie up his 40-foot boat in nearby Little 
Harbor for the rest of the year. There is, he said, little point and no profit 
in going out after cod and other bottom-dwelling species placed under greatly 
reduced quotas in Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't even bothered this year. I can't see myself spending $300 to gear 
up to make $50," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He reluctantly acknowledged that with only a six-month lobster season and no 
ground fishing, he probably could not make it without the assistance he gets 
from the government. "I don't think any of us likes it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is bitter and angry at a government that he believes misread the 
early signs of a declining fishery, at big companies that are buying up 
licenses from small independent fishermen unable to make it, at fishermen who 
drag big nets across the ocean floor, scooping up fish indiscriminately. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last four years I've aged more than I ever have before, trying to beat 
down the ocean," he said. "But when you've only got six months to get a year's 
work in. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' family has lived in the area "since 1700-something," and despite his 
tribulations in 32 years of fishing, he can't imagine leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing else here, and I wouldn't want to do anything else, to tell 
you the truth. . . . It's hard to explain. . . . I'm here to the end, 
regardless of how it turns out. What am I gonna do? I'm 51 years old next 
month. What am I going to retrain for? And how many unemployed people are there 
in Canada?" 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) was outraged. Two American scallop boats out 
of New Bedford were tied up in St. John's, Newfoundland, after being boarded in 
international waters by armed Canadian Coast Guard officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada was claiming those scallops, even though they were outside the 200-mile 
limit. The boats and crews were eventually released, but Frank had a message 
for Fisheries Minister Tobin, who ordered the seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do not resolve international disputes with the use of force," Frank fumed 
in a telephone interview. "You resolve them with negotiations. If Canada is 
going to resort to force, so can we." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Alaska's Sen. Murkowski came to the phone for an interview, he had cooled 
off a bit since being dismissed by Tobin as "a gnat" for complaining about 
Canada's negotiating tactics on Pacific Northwest salmon quotas. The steep fee 
levied by Canada on U.S. fishing boats had been lifted, although the money had 
not been returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Tobin) is attempting to establish himself as a hard driver and as one 
who's had to deal with Canada's situation on the Atlantic Coast, he's 
determined not to allow it to happen on the West Coast," Murkowski said. "But 
he's not very diplomatic . . . and clearly in violation of international law." 
</P>
<P>
 Tobin's response is that at least he's now got everyone's attention. He 
suggested that a year ago there probably were few people in Washington who 
could speak with much expertise on the international fishing crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 A career politician who grew up on a U.S. Air Force base in Newfoundland where 
his father worked as a contract firefighter, Tobin became minister of fisheries 
and oceans a year ago after the election of the Liberal Party as Canada's 
national government. 
</P>
<P>
 He had already gained fame in Parliament as an acid-tongued critic of the 
Conservative government of former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Tobin and a 
handful of other Liberal members of Parliament became known as the "Rat Pack" 
for their verbal gnawing on Mulroney. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those stung by Tobin's aggressive enforcement tactics these days might 
appreciate the nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 "In an emergency situation -- and that's what we're talking about when some of 
the (fish) stocks are disappearing from the face of the planet forever -- we 
can't agree when someone says, 'Let's talk about this for another year and 
meanwhile we'll keep fishing,' " Tobin said. "If that's the case, I know the 
kind of solution they're talking about. It's called no more fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've proven we can talk ourselves down to the last fish. . . . So, should we 
be talking? Absolutely. Should we be cooperating? Absolutely. Could Canada and 
the U.S. be a model (of cooperation) for the world, as we have been on other 
issues? Absolutely. But I won't apologize for protecting resources near the 
Canada coast." 
</P>
<P>
 Tobin's tough posture toward foreign fishermen stems in part from domestic 
politics. It makes the harsh quotas placed on Canadian fishermen more 
palatable, although Tobin's take is that he is not asking fishermen from other 
countries to do anything he does not demand of Canadian fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have brought a new ethic, a new standard to our enforcement issues," he 
said. "It's put us on the moral high ground." Biography

MEDIA; FUGITIVES IN MEXICO TAKE TO THE AIRWAVES; VIEWERS ARE RIVETED TO THE 
SCREEN AS HIGH-PROFILE SUSPECTS TURN THEMSELVES IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Viewers of Television Azteca, Mexico's newest television network, woke up one 
morning early this month to see a live interview with Maria Eugenia Ramirez 
Arauz, a fugitive from justice. 
</P>
<P>
 On the screen, Ramirez Arauz, a suspected conspirator in an audacious 
political assassination, smoked nervously and glanced around the studio as two 
newscasters peppered her with questions, sometimes interrupting each other. 
Then, she picked up a telephone connected to the attorney general's office and 
turned herself in for questioning in the murder of Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the 
second-ranking official in Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the second of three suspects -- among the more than a dozen people 
under arrest in the case -- to have turned themselves over to authorities on 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Angel Cantu, another suspect, had stopped at a station of the rival 
Televisa chain in the border town of Matamoros to call police after he heard 
his mother's televised plea that he give himself up. On Thursday, Marco Antonio 
Rodriguez Gonzalez presented himself at a television station in Mexicali. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country where police are feared more than trusted, live television has 
been thrust into an active role in crime investigations. Television cameras 
were rolling when Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's presidential 
candidate, was killed March 23 in Tijuana. A special prosecutor sought to prove 
a plot based on interpretations of a videotape showing a pushing, shoving mob. 
</P>
<P>
 No tapes were needed to provide evidence of a conspiracy in the Ruiz Massieu 
murder. The suspected triggerman, who witnesses said killed the party leader 
outside a downtown hotel, quickly confessed to being part of a plot. 
</P>
<P>
 As he began naming names, police started making arrests. Cantu and Ramirez 
Arauz decided to give themselves up -- each to a different television station. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are turning themselves in are looking for protection," media 
critic Raul Trejo said. "They want everyone to know that they gave themselves 
up and that they were in good health when they did so." 
</P>
<P>
 Television surrenders may be old hat in Los Angeles, where suspected criminals 
have been giving themselves up to KTLA-TV Channel 5 reporter Warren Wilson for 
the last five years. But in Mexico, the active role that television is taking 
in criminal investigations is still startling, even to broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could never have happened five years ago," said a news executive, who 
asked not to be identified. "If a suspect had gone to a television studio, he 
would have been locked in a room until the police came." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Ramirez Arauz got the opportunity to tell her story to a live 
television audience, rather than relying on law enforcement agencies to release 
her official statement to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was walking around, thinking of giving myself up, but I was afraid," she 
began. Visibly tired, with her brown eyes darting around the studio and the 
dark curls of a ponytail at the nape of her neck, Ramirez Arauz went on to 
recount her life in the days leading up to and following the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 She told of fighting with her common-law husband -- since arrested in the 
alleged murder plot -- over a stranger he had brought to stay at their home. 
The afternoon of the killing, she said, "I was at home, and I saw that the 
person who had stayed at my house was on television as the assassin of Mr. Ruiz 
Massieu."  
</P>
<P>
 Terrified, she fled from the house and wandered the streets for days, buying 
newspapers to learn what was happening to her family. Her brother and two 
brothers-in-law have also been implicated in the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 She claimed on the air that she and her relatives knew nothing about the 
alleged murder plot. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are torturing my family into saying whatever they want them to," she 
charged. At the end of the interview, Ramirez Arauz picked up the telephone. 
The voice of Assistant Atty. Gen. Mario Ruiz Massieu, brother of the slain 
politician, could be heard on the other end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did you go to Television Azteca?" he asked her. She replied: "Because I 
was afraid." Then she asked for a human rights commission representative to be 
present at her questioning. A few hours later, after Ramirez Arauz had 
surrendered, police said she had confessed to participating in the supposed 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The on-air surrenders in the Ruiz Massieu assassination are just the latest 
incidents that have drawn television into crime cases. Previously, kidnapers 
have demanded that representatives of their victims' families appear on 
television and agree to their ransom demands. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, viewers of the nightly news watched a priest, the family lawyer 
and a son of kidnaped banker Alfredo Harp Helu tell a television anchorman that 
they were committed to complying with the abductors' demands. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, Azteca newscasters hosted a similar scene for the family of 
an abducted retail executive. In both cases, the victims were returned unharmed 
after large ransoms were paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, each network had a kidnap victim; now each one has its fugitive from 
justice," said Trejo, the media critic. "It is a little odd." 
</P>
<P>
 Trejo suspects that the television could be reaching its limits as a party to 
crime investigations. Half-joking, he said:, "I don't think we are going to see 
branch television studios in every neighborhood replacing police stations."

AMGEN'S SECURITY PROGRAM BORN OF EXPERIENCE; BIOTECHNOLOGY: THE COMPANY 
THWARTED TWO APPARENT PLANS TO STEAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. SYSTEM RELIES ON 
ALERT, LOYAL EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amgen Inc., the nation's largest biotechnology company, spends hundreds of 
thousands of dollars a year on guards, cameras, computer systems and other 
means of protecting its so-called intellectual property. 
</P>
<P>
 But a planned theft last year of some of Amgen's most carefully guarded 
secrets might have gone entirely unnoticed were it not for a plain, unsigned 
letter that turned up in the company's mailroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the anonymous tip in that letter, Amgen -- along with the FBI and 
one of Wall Street's best-known private investigation companies -- thwarted an 
apparent piracy scheme by a low-level employee. The case, Amgen's second such 
incident in five years, illustrates high-tech firms' vulnerability to corporate 
pirates, especially when the pirates are on the company payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Boni, 40, Amgen's chief of information security, formerly worked in U.S. 
Army counterintelligence and spent 1981 in South Korea catching North Korean 
spies. But even Boni acknowledges that when it comes to guessing the intentions 
of his 3,200 Amgen co-workers, he is virtually powerless. 
</P>
<P>
 If accused CIA spy "Aldrich Ames can betray the trust of his country, what 
makes you think a corporate employee couldn't be tempted?" Boni said. "You pick 
your human vice and gauge the probabilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Like any drug company, Amgen's success hinges on its ability to develop and 
market new products before its competitors do. So far, Thousand Oaks-based 
Amgen has struck gold twice. Its Epogen and Neupogen drugs are widely used by 
cancer and kidney dialysis patients. On the strength of those two drugs Amgen 
had sales of $1.37 billion and a profit of $383 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Blueprints for Epogen, which stimulates the production of red blood cells, 
were stolen in 1988 by an Amgen laboratory researcher who offered to sell the 
documents to a domestic rival for $200,000. That employee was nabbed in a sting 
set up by the FBI and served a prison sentence, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, another laboratory researcher hatched a similar scheme. The 
denouement of this latest incident, as one investigator said, "begins with a 
letter." 
</P>
<P>
 Unsigned and bearing no return address, the letter warned that a laboratory 
worker planned to steal company secrets, including vials of cells that might 
enable an outsider to reproduce Epogen, which for Amgen produced $587 million 
in revenue last year. The employee, whom Amgen declined to name, also had an 
apparent accomplice outside the company, a partner in a purported technology 
export business with contacts overseas, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first to examine the letter was Boni, who quickly gathered the 
standard information most companies keep on its employees: timesheets, expense 
records, security access reports, etc. When Boni looked at the employee's phone 
records, he gulped. 
</P>
<P>
 From a phone at his lab station, the employee, an Asian immigrant, had made 
about 70 calls to a dozen different numbers in his home country within just a 
few weeks. Worried that the worker was ready to cart Amgen's secrets off to the 
pharmaceutical black markets of Asia, Boni turned for help to Kroll Associates, 
one of Wall Street's premier private investigation firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Through its Hong Kong office, Kroll gathered information on the employee's 
calls, learning that he appeared to be shopping Amgen's technology among 
potential buyers in his home country, including some with government 
connections. Neither Kroll nor Amgen would identify the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kroll's Los Angeles office placed the Amgen employee under 
surveillance. He had not made off with any secrets yet, Kroll determined, but 
agents followed him everywhere, waiting for his first misstep. 
</P>
<P>
 Another anonymous letter arrived, apparently from the same source, saying that 
the employee and his accomplice planned to enter an Amgen lab on the following 
Sunday evening. When they did, investigators from Amgen, Kroll and the FBI -- 
which was updated throughout the two-week investigation -- strolled in to greet 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were pretty shocked, sort of shocked into silence," said Stephen Vale, 
head of Kroll's Los Angeles office, who was among the investigators to confront 
the duo. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught bringing an outsider into a laboratory without permission, and 
confronted with the phone records, the employee confessed that evening and was 
fired. No charges were filed because nothing had been stolen, Boni said, and 
proving conspiracy to steal "would have been touch and go." 
</P>
<P>
 During interviews that evening, investigators learned that the conspirators 
were woefully unsophisticated, and so underfinanced that they had sneaked onto 
the Amgen campus that evening not to steal vials of cells, but to make free 
calls to Asia using Amgen's phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Had they pulled off their caper, the two partners might have made a small 
fortune for themselves by selling the drug cells, which could be copied and 
mass-produced through genetic engineering, perhaps in a country with little 
regard for patent protections. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly concerned about high-tech piracy, Amgen spends $150,000 a year on 
desktop computer software, encryption technology for fax machines, voice 
scramblers for cellular phones and other security devices. In the past two 
years, the company has purchased $500,000 in software to protect its computer 
systems from hackers who might tunnel in through computer lines to look at 
Amgen's files. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the company even set up its own computer network. Although 
Amgen is still connected to the Internet -- the global computer network -- its 
sensitive data is transmitted across privately leased communication lines that 
connect its Thousand Oaks systems to Amgen locations in England and 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 But experience has taught Amgen that not every thief travels the information 
superhighway. So the company conducts background checks on virtually all of its 
new hires, a daunting task considering it has grown from 500 employees five 
years ago to 3,200 today. Boni also lectures new hires on their role in 
protecting the company's interests, often recounting the lesson of last year's 
theft attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all of Amgen's high-tech security systems, that lowly lab worker's 
scheme might have gone undetected if it weren't for an ordinary letter, 
undoubtedly mailed by an alert employee. "Your employees," Boni said, "are your 
best line of defense."

NEXT STEP; BHUTTO FALLS SHORT OF PROMISE; PAKISTAN'S PREMIER GETS A SECOND 
CHANCE. BUT SOCIAL STRIFE, CORRUPTION AND IN-FIGHTING ARE FLOURISHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago this week, a young, well-born Ivy Leaguer who had been the first 
woman elected to govern a Muslim country took to the airwaves to vow that this 
time she would not disappoint the Pakistani people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear countrymen! The dark clouds besetting our democratic horizon have 
disappeared and given way to a new dawn," Benazir Bhutto declared. "By Allah's 
grace and your prayers, I have become the prime minister to serve the country." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Oct. 20, 1993, and an upset election victory and a craftily assembled 
parliamentary coalition had given Bhutto another chance at governing one of the 
Islamic world's most powerful yet troubled states.  
</P>
<P>
 Bhutto's first 20-month term, which ended in 1990 with her being removed for 
alleged incompetence and corruption, left many of her followers sadder but 
wiser. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a second chance, and victory in her country's freest elections in 
history, she told the nation: "With my mind's eye I envision a glorious future 
ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The glamorous daughter of the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the rural landlord who 
became the most popular premier in Pakistani history, still had the undisputed 
gift to inspire, to make the poor dream of a more decent life. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve months have now passed in Pakistan -- "the Land of the Pure" -- and for 
many the clouds again have been replaced by a haze of gloom. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year of her second chance, Bhutto, now 41 and said by some Pakistani 
newspapers to to be expecting her fourth child, has managed to stave off 
frantic efforts to oust her by the man she defeated last October, ex-Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif. But in striving to reach the lofty goals she set herself 
and her Pakistan People's Party -- "progress and prosperity" for all of 
Pakistan's 120 million people -- she has fallen short. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Political gambits and in-fighting are eating up much of her government's time, 
the economy is idling, corruption is endemic, and social strife has become so 
widespread that, in a nation created as an Islamic homeland, Shiites and Sunnis 
are murdering one other. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at recent history, Pakistan has had seven prime ministers in 
eight years," Zaffar Abbas, Islamabad bureau chief for the Herald magazine, 
observed. "Completing one year in office with all the turmoil and everybody 
trying to bring down the government is an achievement in itself. Apart from 
that, it has been a disappointing story." 
</P>
<P>
 Disillusion has been all the greater this time because Bhutto was able to 
install a close ally, Farooq Leghari, as president, and the once-hostile army 
has seemed to remain neutral under its current chief, Gen. Abdul Waheed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts ask if Bhutto, the Harvard and Oxford grad who shouldered the 
populist mantle of her father following his execution in 1979, has concluded 
some sort of Faustian bargain. In exchange for political survival, they wonder, 
has she relinquished her oft-proclaimed goals: radical reform of society, 
protection of women's rights and the fostering of a modern, prosperous nation 
united by a staunch but tolerant belief in Islam? 
</P>
<P>
 Not at all, asserts Bhutto. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to an agenda for change," she said in a recent speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has completely set aside her party's ideals," Abbas said in disagreement. 
" 'For the time being,' her supporters say. But as of today, she has set them 
aside. She has done these things to guarantee her survival at the cost of 
ignoring the party ideals." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign economists and bankers applaud the tough, often unpopular measures she 
has undertaken to make Pakistan's government live within its means and to 
privatize key sectors like energy and telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 Bhutto has cut the once-ballooning budget deficit from 8% to 5.8% of gross 
domestic product. Currency reserves have increased from a meager $200 million 
in June, 1993, to a staggering $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her government has announced plans to sell off 49% of state-owned oil and gas 
enterprises within a year, and raised at least $860 million last month through 
privatization of the telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
 For the average Pakistani, who Bhutto's father courted with Huey Long-like 
visions of "bread, a roof and clothing," such numbers matter not at all, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Disgruntled consumers and shopkeepers can cite other figures: a 20% price hike 
on wheat as of last April, or new sales taxes. Inflation, the Bhutto 
government's No. 1 economic priority, is still averaging an official 11.5%, 
while economic growth last year was only 4% against a targeted 7.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bhutto loyalists say the government's strategy, including innovative 
policies designed to entice foreign investment to revitalize the laggard energy 
and petroleum sectors, make them bullish about the remainder of the prime 
minister's five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, in the first nine months, you couldn't see anything happening. All of 
these policies were being put into place," said Saleem Zulfiqar Khan, an 
Islamabad corporate lawyer. "But in the last three to four weeks, there has 
been a change in public opinion, I think. People have seen that these policies, 
which were just words to them, are putting money on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 This month, for instance, a Hong Kong tycoon announced the construction of a 
5,280-megawatt coal-fired power plant worth $7.5 billion -- the largest single 
investment in Pakistan's history. In September, a U.S. business delegation led 
by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary signed contracts worth nearly $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistanis who theorize that their country is about to take off economically 
because of the groundwork performed during Bhutto's first 12 months in office 
believe that is the logic behind the invigorated campaign of protests and 
strikes that Nawaz Sharif began last month to oust her. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Pakistan Muslim League leader waited another three to four months, they 
theorize, the rebirth of prosperity would be so obvious that he would get 
little support. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "By creating instability, he is trying to scare off foreign investment," 
charged Khurshid Hasan Meer, a founding member of the People's Party and former 
Pakistani health and labor minister. "He wants people injured, people dead, and 
he wants clashes. He's gone berserk." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharif, a balding 45-year-old Punjabi who once promised Bhutto his full 
cooperation, has exchanged damaging allegations of graft and corruption with 
her ministers. As tax authorities probe Sharif and his allies for alleged 
financial misdeeds and real estate scams while the industrialist was in power, 
Sharif has accused President Leghari of involvement in a land scandal and of 
hoarding cotton along with Bhutto's husband, Asif Zardari, to make a killing on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The political weather has grown so stormy that on Aug. 23, Sharif breached one 
of the few ground rules of Pakistan's roughhouse politics by proclaiming that 
the country had nuclear bombs, as U.S. experts long believed. Sharif claimed 
that he acted to prevent Bhutto, whom he called a "security risk," from rolling 
back the program. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bizarre twist in the political career of the businessman turned 
politician plucked from obscurity by Gen. Muhammad Zia ul-Haq, the late 
military ruler who was the man who overthrew Bhutto's father and had him 
hanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Bhutto, in the meantime, appears to have done much to mend her bridges with 
Zia's successors. Defense expenditure still consumes 34.5% of the government 
budget, appeasing leaders of the 577,000-man military but making it hard to 
deliver on her party's promises of better education, health and welfare 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Bhutto has failed over the last 12 months in her greatest challenge: to 
restore tranquillity to a land riven by a bewildering variety of conflicts. 
Since she began her second term, Muslim fundamentalists have increased their 
attacks on minorities, including Pakistani Christians and members of the 
Ahmadiya sect, and women. Hundreds of people have been thrown in jail for 
violating an anti-blasphemy law. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenge killings have mounted among rival Sunni and Shiite gangs. Tribal wars 
have broken out in the deserts of Baluchistan. Perhaps most worrisome for 
Bhutto is her native Sind. Karachi, the province's seaside capital and the 
nation's business and industrial hub, has been turned into a Dodge City by 
shootouts between Sindis and embittered Muslim transplants from India, the 
Mohajirs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bhuttos' own civil war also continues. Although Benazir's feud with her 
mother, Nusrat, seems to have cooled since the days when her mother called her 
a "dictator," her younger brother doesn't flinch from impugning her competence 
or character. Murtaza Bhutto accuses his sister and her husband of accepting a 
$2-million campaign gift from a banker now jailed on fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
 PPP stalwarts claim that Bhutto is delivering on her populist promises, and 
cite a 30% increase in the education budget and the recruitment of 30,000 women 
to care for rural children and expectant mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bhutto's supporters say she needs more time. "No, the people aren't 100% 
happy," attorney Khan allowed. "So let's say they're less unhappy than they 
were." Biography

POSTSCRIPT; DIGGING INTO THE PAST; RECANTED TESTIMONY ABOUT A CHILD'S EXECUTION 
IN WWII UKRAINE CAUSES A FUROR AND REOPENS CONTROVERSY OVER SOVIET-ERA 
EVIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MYCIO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are no Jews left in Lisets.  
</P>
<P>
 An abandoned cemetery of tumbling gravestones engraved in Hebrew is the only 
visible reminder of the 40 Jewish families that lived in this western Ukrainian 
village before the Nazis deported them in the first phase of Adolf Hitler's 
Final Solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere within the cemetery's chain-link fence lies the tiny grave of Monica 
Singer, the town doctor's 4-year-old daughter, who escaped the roundup only to 
be exposed as a Jew and executed outside the Nazi-run police station. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the people of Lisets forgot about Monica. But a renewed quest to 
punish her accused killer is forcing some of them to re-examine the past, and 
the results are casting new light on one of the few areas of American-Soviet 
cooperation during the Cold War: the hunt for Nazi war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna Snigur remembers that autumn evening in 1943, when she was driving the 
family cows home from pasture and saw a uniformed man carrying the Singer girl 
out of the police station. 
</P>
<P>
 "The child was crying: 'Mama, he's going to kill me and I want to live!' " 
recalled Snigur, 64, in her parlor hung with colorful embroideries and a poster 
of the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four decades after the Soviets replaced the occupying Nazis, Snigur 
told her story to five Soviet officials and Kathleen Coleman, a lawyer from the 
U.S. Justice Department's Nazi-hunting unit, the Office of Special 
Investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the videotaped interview, Snigur accused Bohdan Koziy, a Ukrainian American 
then running a hotel in Florida, of being the policeman who killed Monica. 
Although Snigur testified that she only heard the gunshots, three of her 
neighbors said they saw Koziy shoot Monica and also fingered him as the 
murderer of other Lisets Jews.  
</P>
<P>
 Based on those videotaped depositions, in 1984, a Florida court stripped Koziy 
of his U.S. citizenship for concealing his wartime past from immigration 
officials. Koziy maintained he was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing deportation to the Soviet Union to stand trial for war crimes, Koziy 
fled to Costa Rica. He had been living there in relative obscurity from 1985 
until June, when the World Jewish Congress launched a campaign to have Koziy, 
84, expelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Costa Rica is disgraced before the world community for continuing to harbor 
this mass murderer," said Elan Steinberg, the congress's executive director, by 
telephone from New York.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite demands for Koziy's expulsion by U.S. lawmakers, including the sole 
Holocaust survivor in Congress, Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Burlingame), Costa Rica has 
refused to oust him without an extradition request. 
</P>
<P>
 The most logical country to request extradition would be the now-independent 
Ukraine, the scene of Koziy's alleged crimes. But when news of the campaign 
reached Lisets, Hanna Snigur decided that it was time to clear her conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a false witness," she admitted, "and I don't want to sin before God for 
making an innocent suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 While Snigur did see someone carry Monica out of the police station, she now 
maintains that it was not Koziy and that she never heard any gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 Snigur said it had never even occurred to her that Koziy was the killer until 
the KGB, which led Soviet war crimes investigations, began questioning her 
about Koziy in the mid-1970s.  
</P>
<P>
 "I kept telling them I didn't see anything," she insisted.  
</P>
<P>
 But when a Lisets policeman who was also a witness in the case threatened to 
send her "to see the polar bears in Siberia" during a 1976 KGB interrogation in 
nearby Ivano-Frankivsk, Snigur said, "I was afraid and I understood that I had 
to say that I saw Koziy carrying that child."  
</P>
<P>
 She was also afraid when the Americans videotaped her. The KGB agents who 
interrogated her in 1976 warned her not to change her story and "they were all 
there, in the room," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first witness in a Nazi war criminal case to publicly charge that she 
was forced to lie under threats from Soviet authorities, Snigur has reopened 
the old controversy over the Office of Special Investigations' use of what 
critics called "Soviet evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare show of Cold War cooperation, the Soviets actively helped the OSI 
hunt for Nazi collaborators by providing lists of suspects in the United 
States, most of them emigres from East Bloc countries and what were then the 
Baltic and Ukrainian Soviet republics. The Soviets also provided copies of 
documents and witnesses -- such as Snigur -- to prove the guilt of suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snigur shows that Soviet evidence was unreliable and the OSI was either duped 
or deliberately defrauded the U.S. courts in using it," charged New York lawyer 
Askold Lozynskyj, who was a member of Koziy's defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steinberg, the World Jewish Congress executive, dismisses anything that 
Snigur says outside of a courtroom, contending that her change of heart has 
less to do with Soviet arm-twisting than with a new political climate in 
Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 "That region was a hotbed of Nazi collaboration," Steinberg said. "During the 
Soviet era, this was something people wanted to hide. Now, many of the same 
collaborationist sentiments are coming to the fore." 
</P>
<P>
 Other skeptics point out that because the three Lisets witnesses who testified 
with Snigur are dead, including the police officer who allegedly threatened 
her, it is impossible to verify their earlier testimonies. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Myron Wasylyk, a Ukrainian American on a council of advisers to the 
Ukrainian Parliament, Steinberg's equation of Ukrainians with collaborators 
simply proves the success of what he calls a KGB campaign of using the war 
criminal cases "to paint anti-Communist emigres as Nazis and anti-Semites in 
order to undermine their political influence in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasylyk's colleague on the council, Petro Matiaszek, recalls feeling that 
campaign's effects when he told fellow students at Seton Hall University in 
South Orange, N.J., of his Ukrainian heritage, only to be asked if his father 
was a Nazi. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was supposedly a joke, but it reflected a widely accepted stereotype," 
Matiaszek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksander Skipalsky, a former KGB colonel, confirmed that 
"neutralizing" anti-Communist emigre groups "was definitely one of the KGB's 
goals" in helping OSI. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were interested in finding war criminals," he said. "But only if they 
served that larger political purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Skipalsky cautions against assuming that the Soviets were 
deliberately framing innocent people. "You have to re-examine each case," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lozynskyj, the New York lawyer who worked on the Koziy case, has long been 
convinced that the Soviets were pursuing a hidden political agenda under the 
guise of Nazi hunting and twisting the truth to achieve it. But he could never 
find proof. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no access to anything in the U.S.S.R.," he complained in a telephone 
interview.  
</P>
<P>
 Soviet witnesses were not allowed to travel to the United States, and 
depositions in the Soviet Union were taken by Soviet prosecutors "who 
interfered with defense attorneys' cross-examination," Lozynskyj said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a farce," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when foreigners' movements in the Soviet Union were severely 
restricted, it was also impossible for defense attorneys to hunt for their own 
evidence. In the case of John Demjanjuk, deported from the United States to 
Israel for alleged war crimes, Lozynskyj noted, it was only under the easing 
policy of glasnost that Demjanjuk's lawyers were allowed to travel around what 
was then still the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic to find evidence they 
claim showed that the brutal death camp guard "Ivan the Terrible" was someone 
else.  
</P>
<P>
 Koziy's attorneys were not permitted to visit Lisets because the village lies 
in the Ivano-Frankivsk region, home to the Mukachevo radar station and thus a 
closed military zones. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But now that the U.S.S.R. is no more and Ivano-Frankivsk is open to the 
public, Snigur's recantation has fueled a local counter-campaign to clear 
Koziy's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhailo Boichuk, a deputy on the Ivano-Frankivsk regional council's human 
rights commission who has been collecting evidence from Snigur and other Lisets 
residents, is sure that Koziy was framed by the KGB. He has asked the local 
Ukrainian security service, successor to the Soviet KGB, to drop the charges 
against Koziy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way, Koziy can come to Ukraine without fear if Costa Rica expels him," 
he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Snigur's recantation would be enough to return Koziy's U.S. 
citizenship is unclear. Lozynskyj, Koziy's lawyer, did not indicate whether 
Koziy would seek to return to Florida. But now that the sole living witness 
against Koziy claims that he is innocent, political observers consider it 
unlikely that Ukraine will seek his extradition from Costa Rica.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: CHEROKEE PLANS TO ENTER 2ND BANKRUPTCY FILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cherokee Inc. announced its plan to enter a prepackaged bankruptcy 
reorganization by the end of the year. It would be the second Chapter 11 filing 
for the debt-plagued Sunland apparel maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the company said that a key element of the plan was in place, with 
the agreement by a bondholders committee to swap long-term debt for common 
stock. Under the plan, all of the company's 11% senior subordinated notes due 
in 1999 would be swapped for about 89.9% of the common stock of the reorganized 
Cherokee. In addition, all outstanding trade debt would be exchanged for about 
8.3% of the common stock of the reorganized company. Existing Cherokee stock 
would be converted to about 1.8% of the common stock of the post-bankruptcy 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherokee said the plan would reduce its long-term debt from about $100 million 
to about $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
 CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc., has agreed to provide Cherokee with 
"debtor-in-possession" financing during the Chapter 11 proceedings, Cherokee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdened by debt from a 1989 leveraged buyout, Cherokee entered and emerged 
from another prepackaged bankruptcy last year. In the fiscal year ended May 28, 
it lost $24.8 million on $114.1 million in sales. The company has lately been 
streamlining its apparel selection to focus on casual clothes.

MARKET FOCUS; BUILDERS SEE NO CEILING ON EXPORTING TO JAPAN; IT'S THE MOST 
LUCRATIVE HOUSING MARKET IN THE WORLD, WITH 1.6 MILLION STARTS A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's advertised as the "Three-Floor Dream," and Sumitomo Ringyo Co.'s latest 
model home is unquestionably a fantasy compared to the cramped abodes the 
Japanese normally endure. Encompassing 1,700 square feet, the house boasts four 
bedrooms, 2 1/2 bathrooms, two dining rooms and balcony space galore. 
</P>
<P>
 But to foreign home-builders visiting here recently, it was the price tag that 
seemed make-believe: $900,000 -- and that's not including the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could put that up for $80,000, and that's an absolute fact," gasped Irish 
home builder Gerard McCaughey, his jaw literally dropping. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California beachfront builders would charge about $170,000, added 
McCaughey, who lived and worked there as marketing director for Ireland's 
largest builder, Century Homes. Mark Hutchinson, a lumber supplier from Idaho, 
reckoned $170,000 would buy both the home and the land in Boise. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear these kinds of stories and you see dollar signs," McCaughey said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's precisely the point, in the eyes of the Japanese government. Last year, 
the coalition government of then-Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced a 
national target to cut Japanese home prices -- now among the most expensive in 
the world -- by one-third by the year 2000. Scrambling for ways to meet that 
goal, both government officials and private firms have launched campaigns to 
increase housing imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only would better housing at lower prices fill the single greatest demand 
of Japanese consumers. It would also help shave the politically nettlesome 
trade imbalance between the United States and Japan, pointed out Shusaku 
Hirano, who is leading the campaign for the Japan External Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "One imported housing kit costs $70,000 to $80,000. That's two or three times 
the cost of an automobile, so it's worth it for us to tackle," Hirano said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 JETRO sponsored the recent visit of 60 builders, suppliers and trade promotion 
officials from 20 nations to study Japan's housing market. The organization has 
also erected four foreign model homes in Yokohama, a port city 30 minutes by 
train from Tokyo, and formed an Import Housing Promotion Council along with 
other industry and government officials. In addition, the Export-Import Bank is 
providing low-cost loans to Japanese importers of foreign homes and building 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 For foreign builders, the payoffs are potentially huge. Japan is the most 
lucrative housing market in the world, with more housing starts per year -- 1.6 
million -- than the United States despite a population half the size. The 
market is growing by more than 8% a year, Hirano said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Japanese consumers have the money to take on mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most economically promising market in the world, bar none, for Western 
homes is Japan," said Don O. Carlson, editor and publisher of the Automated 
Builder, a building trades publication based in Carpinteria. "Mexico needs 6 
million homes and the Soviet Union in excess of 12 million. But the question 
is, can they pay for them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the average home here is twice as expensive as one in the United States, 
and the gap widens further when land is included. The cost of building 
materials is boosted by an unwieldy distribution system padded with layers of 
brokers, complicated regulations and detailed inspection systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Every single imported faucet, for instance, must be individually examined and 
approved by a committee of government and industry officials, said H. Kohda, 
director of Sumitomo Fudosan Home Co. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, high labor costs and construction techniques that Japanese 
builders themselves admit are relatively inefficient also boost the price. 
Japanese construction workers are paid about $220 a day, regardless of output 
or skill level. In the United States, pay scales are differentiated by skill, 
and payment by piecework -- $100 per door, for instance -- is common. 
</P>
<P>
 And because all U.S. housing is built with lumber based on a 2-by-4 standard, 
American homes use an average of 28 types of lumber. Traditional Japanese 
homes, in contrast, use 150 different types of lumber, much of it requiring 
complicated cutwork. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, erecting homes takes twice as long in Japan. Training framers 
takes two years in the United States, compared to 10 years or longer in Japan, 
Hirano said. 
</P>
<P>
 The market opportunities may sound too good to be true, and some of them are. 
For instance, even if U.S. housing kits are cheaper, they still have to be put 
together here. That means the price advantage is all but eaten up by Japan's 
higher costs for labor, transportation and other services. The final selling 
price of imported homes is only about 7% lower than that of Japanese homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another formidable barrier is the refusal of the Japan Housing Loan Corp. to 
extend low-cost financing to imported homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, builders here see plenty of ways to make a yen on the import boom. In 
contrast to U.S. cars, which are still plagued with poor reputations, the 
American home is idealized as bright, spacious and enviably well built. 
Japanese homes tend to have lower ceilings, smaller rooms and an average life 
span of just 20 years -- reasons why a French trade minister once derided them 
as "rabbit hutches," in a slur that stung the national consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 "An American house is a dream to many Japanese," said Sumitomo's Kohda. The 
firm, whose Laguna Hills-based subsidiary has built 1,400 homes in Southern 
California since 1972, is sponsoring an "American Fair" to publicize its own 
drive to import housing kits and parts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sumitomo, fiercely competing with other Japanese builders in the race to cut 
housing costs, plans to increase imports of kitchen cabinets, flooring, 
accessories, lumber and other building materials to 50% of total procurement in 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm is also planning to boost its imports of housing packages. By keeping 
the proportion of Japanese parts to 60%, it will make the homes eligible for 
low-cost government financing, Kohda said. And Sumitomo still expects to shave 
its home prices by one-third. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be easy to buck the convoluted distribution system that, despite its 
inefficiencies, keeps scores of people employed. After the firm launched its 
"American Fair" this month, it was deluged with visits from local suppliers who 
feared getting bypassed if Sumitomo begins importing directly from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 But, amid cutthroat competition, Kohda says Sumitomo has no other choice but 
to eventually eliminate most middlemen.  
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to know what our intentions were, what role they could play in 
our new strategy. They were filled with anxiety," Kohda said. "I told them, 'We 
have to survive.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Hege is also confident about Japan's market prospects. Sensing the 
housing boom when he visited Kyoto last year, the architect plunged ahead and 
started an export firm in April. The Los Angeles-based firm, Transpacific 
Housing Systems, exports housing, construction materials and such services as 
interior design and project management. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime student of Japan, Hege has been careful to prepare his materials in 
both English and Japanese, take the time to find suitable Japanese partners and 
offer products customized for the Japanese consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 His homes, for instance, offer such standard Japanese features as an entryway 
where people can take their shoes off, rooms with bamboo "tatami" mats and 
bathrooms that separate the toilet from the bath. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes still cost significantly more than those Hege builds in the United 
States: A home that goes for $110,000 in Big Bear cost $285,000 to put up in 
the Mount Fuji resort area of Hakone, for instance. But Hege hopes eventually 
to bring the costs down as he trains Japanese builders in the more efficient 
system of U.S. construction management. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good market for the right person," Hege said. "But you have to be 
committed, and you have to be willing to do things in a Japanese way." HOUSE

REGIONAL EARNINGS: TRANSWORLD BANCORP REBOUNDS FROM LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TransWorld Bancorp, the Sherman Oaks-based parent of Trans World Bank, bounced 
back with solid earnings in the third quarter after a year-earlier loss. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three-month period that ended Sept. 30, the bank reported net income of 
$764,000, compared to a $98,000 loss in the same quarter of 1993.For its 
nine-month period, the bank reported profit of $1.66 million, up 86% from 
$891,000 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank attributed the improved results to stronger interest margins and a 
lower loan loss provision. "Total assets, as well as asset quality, have 
improved substantially during 1994," said David H. Hender, chief executive of 
TransWorld. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Sept. 30, total assets were $385 million, up 19% from $325 million a 
year earlier. Meanwhile, TransWorld's deposits grew 20% to $355 million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: CALNETICS' 1ST-QUARTER PROFIT 56% HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calnetics Corp., a Chatsworth maker of plastic components, posted a profit of

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: COUNTY HOUSING MARKET IS SHOWING SIGNS OF A REBOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County market for mid-priced and even expensive new homes has 
begun to pull out of a long slack period, housing executives report. In fact, 
one expert predicts that sales of new homes in the county will double by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 In eastern Ventura, R. L. Hertel-Constructors Inc. has sold 53 Citrus Hills 
houses, priced above $260,000, since the development opened in March. "It's 
going very well," said Tom Habbick, Hertel's president. "We're addressing a 
move-up market that hasn't received much attention in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a pent-up demand in this area for mid-priced houses. Most projects 
seem to be priced for first-time buyers, in the $180,000 to $200,000 range." 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the county, near the Los Angeles County line, David H. 
Murdock's Sherwood Country Club development has redirected its marketing toward 
more modestly priced houses in the $500,000 to $750,000 range, and buyers are 
responding. 
</P>
<P>
 When Murdock started building homes at Lake Sherwood in early 1991, they were 
priced from $1 million to $4 million. With the recession taking hold, there 
were few takers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, however, some luxury features have been trimmed, making 
lower prices possible, says Tony Lennon, who became sales director in early 
1993. That, plus an improving economy, seems to have worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're on our way," Lennon said. "We've recorded 35 sales so far this 
year. Mostly, they're in the lower-priced houses and in our townhouses, which 
are priced from $475,000 upward. But people are also showing interest in a new 
group of houses we're building in the $1.4-million to $1.6-million range." In 
all, Lennon says 75 to 80 homes have been sold by Murdock at Sherwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennon, a cousin of the singing Lennon Sisters, says events such as the senior 
tennis Champions tournament with Jimmy Connors and Bjorn Borg held at Sherwood 
Country Club just concluded, probably helps by bringing potential buyers into 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 John Pfister, vice president of marketing research for Chicago Title & Trust, 
believes that Ventura County and California in general will stage a dramatic 
housing comeback in the next two years. Pfister, who annually conducts a 
nationwide construction survey, reports that the number of new homes per 100 
households declined in Ventura County last year. The county ranked 74th among 
81 metropolitan areas surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all going to change dramatically," Pfister said. "California is going 
to make a comeback that will surprise a lot of people." He's confident that the 
region's housing market will recover from such blows as the Northridge 
earthquake, urban unrest, defense cutbacks and the recession.

 Someday, Yvon Chouinard, owner-founder of Ventura-based Patagonia Inc., hopes 
to turn over ownership of the outdoor clothing manufacturer to his 
employees.But "open-book management" comes first. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent issue of an in-house publication, Chouinard said he hopes to teach 
employees "how to understand the numbers on a balance sheet, a (profit and 
loss) statement, a cash flow chart." 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't sure how or when the ownership transition will take place, he wrote. 
"But we do know this is the right direction, especially if we want to gain the 
full benefit of the energy and creativity of 520 employees working in concert."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: 3DBM INC. WINS CONTRACT FOR NAVY SIMULATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Camarillo firm with the unusual name 3dbm Inc. has been awarded a 
$1.8-million contract to produce "threat simulators" for the Naval Air Weapons 
Station at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 The simulators act as enemy radar and are used by the Navy as targets in 
missile test firings, reports James A. Tranovich, 3dbm's vice president of 
engineering."It's our last defense contract," he said. "Five years ago, we were 
90% defense-related. Now, military work accounts for less than 20% of our 
revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, 3dbm is concentrating on producing low-power television 
transmitters. The firm already has a significant share of the U. S. market and 
is negotiating a joint venture with a company in China to make and sell the 
transmitters there. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Chinese deal is successful, 3dbm expects to hire additional engineers 
and assembly workers, Tranovich said. The firm now has 65 employees. As for 
that strange name, Tranovich says it has to do with wattage. "Somebody thought 
of it 25 years ago when the company was founded. It was a feeble attempt at 
wordplay, but we've stuck with it."

LOCKHEED'S F-16 HITS EXPORT TARGETS; WITH U.S AIR FORCE ORDERS CURTAILED, THE 
VERSATILE WARPLANE HAS FOUND NEW CUSTOMERS ABROAD. BUT COMPETITORS HAVE THE 
SAME TERRITORY IN THEIR SIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 16 years, the banana-shaped profile of Lockheed Corp.'s F-16 "Fighting 
Falcon" has been the pride oS. fighter crews, who nickname the jets and scrub 
them spotless with orange-scented cleanser. 
</P>
<P>
 But the F-16's days as an American emblem are waning. Although the U.S. Air 
Force has bought 2,000 of them -- and recently dispatched 84 to the Persian 
Gulf in response to Iraqi troop movements -- it is ending orders this year due 
to post-Cold War budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 So today, most new F-16s coming off Lockheed's Fort Worth assembly line are 
destined for other countries. Over the years, 17 foreign countries, with U.S. 
approval, have bought the versatile, single-engine warplane. And overseas 
customers, including Singapore, Egypt, Portugal and Taiwan, now account for 90% 
of Lockheed's impressive $11-billion F-16 backlog. 
</P>
<P>
 Some new foreign sales have been controversial, but they have helped make the 
F-16 one of Lockheed's most profitable programs. Lockheed took over the F-16 
project and the Fort Worth production plant from General Dynamics in March, 
1993, and has since restructured its operations. The revenues from the Fort 
Worth plant are estimated by analysts at $3 billion per year, nearly 25% of 
Lockheed's total sales. "The F-16 is a mature program. It no longer requires 
large investment, so it's throwing off a lot of cash," said Loren B. Thompson, 
a defense consultant and policy analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's next-generation jet fighter, the F-22, which it is developing with 
the Boeing Co., won't be delivered to the U.S. Air Force until 2004, if all 
goes well.  
</P>
<P>
 Given that lag, Lockheed is not about to let the F-16 market slip away. In its 
aggressive effort to keep the F-16 alive, the firm has laid off hundreds of 
workers to save costs, supplied both sides of an arms race between Greece and 
Turkey, pushed hard for new sales in developing countries like Chile, and 
agreed to transfer unprecedented levels of technology as part of a sale of 
planes to South Korea. The deal allowed South Korea to manufacture most of the 
plane itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Arms-control advocates say such an agenda heightens the risk of high-tech 
warfare in the developing world. With the Cold War over, the United States 
should seize its chance to limit global defense trade, said Lora Lumpe, 
director of the Washington, D.C.-based Arms Sales Monitoring Project of the 
Federation of American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Others argue grimly that if the U.S. doesn't sell fighter planes, Russia, 
Britain or some other country will. Political realism dictates that export 
limits focus on more lethal technology. "It's the way it is," said Kenneth 
Watman, researcher at the Rand Corp, adding, "That doesn't mean I like it." 
</P>
<P>
 From Lockheed's point of view, the company is doing what it takes to make 
money in what has become an increasingly competitive international market for 
Cold War products. Joe Stout, a Lockheed spokesman, also argues that sales of 
American fighter planes allow for U.S. control of contract terms, training and 
spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed believes there's a market for 500 to 800 new fighter aircraft 
worldwide in the next few years. But overall, the market for military hardware 
is constricted. U.S. foreign military sales dropped from a record high of $33.2 
billion last year to $12.6 billion in fiscal 1994, according to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Tooth-and-nail competition for foreign contracts pits Lockheed against other 
makers of fighter aircraft. These include Lockheed's domestic rival, McDonnell 
Douglas Corp., which makes the F/A-18 "Hornet", a fatter, twin-engine jet used 
by the U.S. Navy. McDonnell Douglas also makes the F-15 "Eagle" an air-combat 
fighter that costs about $50 million. Last year McDonnell Douglas won a major 
victory at Lockheed's expense when it landed a $2-billion deal to build 21 new 
F-15s for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed is now vying with McDonnell Douglas again for a potential 
multibillion-dollar contract from the United Arab Emirates, which wants as many 
as 80 fighter planes. Experts say the contest is shaping into another highly 
competitive duel, with the likely result that the tiny gulf state will someday 
own planes as good as those of the U.S. Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has Lockheed neglected the domestic market. The company is an enthusiastic 
backer of a Pentagon proposal dubbed a "high-tech yard sale" by Tom Cardamone, 
editor of Arms Trade News in Washington, D.C., and a critic of the plan. The 
Pentagon idea is to sell as many as 360 used F-16s abroad next year. Money 
raised would be spent on new F-16 Lockheed planes for the Air Force. Potential 
recipients are countries that would have trouble affording planes otherwise, 
such as the Philippines, Tunisia and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 If Congress signs off on the plan, Lockheed also stands to gain by doing 
modification work on the old F-16s before they are parceled out. Lockheed has 
also tried to get the Pentagon to buy a few more F-16s by reducing the price to 
$20 million per plane, down from about $23 million from its latest sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The versatility and low price of the F-16 has made it a valuable commodity. 
The jet is used for both bombing raids and dogfights, day or night. F-16s made 
one-quarter of the air strike sorties by the U.S. military against Iraq in 1991 
and were deployed last spring against Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Paul McIntosh, who flies an F-16 nicknamed "Wild Thang" out of Utah's 
Hill Air Force Base, said the plane's avionics and electronics are so advanced 
that the cockpit resembles a videogame, and is about as easy to use. Flying the 
plane "is like sitting on the edge of a magic carpet," McIntosh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-seat F-16 is a 50-foot cylinder of smooth, gleaming metal with a 
pointy nose. Its fuselage is so slender that you could almost wrap your arms 
around it. At times, the F-16 has gotten too fancy for its own good: One 
version of the plane offered a steering stick so sensitive that it responded to 
the slightest pressure of the palm. Air Force pilots -- who were used to 
less-sensitive parts -- were unnerved, and eventually the device was retooled 
to allow a small amount of gratuitous motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed attributes the long life of the plane to continuous upgrades. Newer 
versions offer state-of-the-art radar technology and ever more powerful engines 
-- all packed into a design that dates back to the '70s. Once, you could easily 
slide a fist in the space between the engine's nozzle and the wall of the 
fuselage that contains it. Now, because the engine is so much bigger, you could 
barely squeeze a quarter between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Lockheed bought the F-16 program from General Dynamics, it has also 
introduced what the company calls "lean manufacturing" techniques. About 14,000 
people work in the Forth Worth plant now, down from 31,000 five years ago, and 
Lockheed will bring that number down to 13,000 by the end of this year to 
reduce the cost of the F-16. Since it acquired the plant, Lockheed claims 
revenue earnings per employee have doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes have not come without pain, however. In some cases, Lockheed 
workers who lost their jobs end up being hired back through subcontractors for 
lower pay, said John C. Crowdis, business representative for the local chapter 
of the International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union is 
also angry about foreign production of F-16s. Workers protested when the 
company agreed to transfer some technology as part of its deal to allow South 
Korea to make the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had to make some tough decisions. . . . But the fact is it allows us 
to make sales that we wouldn't make otherwise," replied Stout, the Lockheed 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither exports nor foreign production of the F-16 are new. Assembly lines for 
portions of the fighter were set up in Belgium and the Netherlands for members 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the same year the U.S. Air Force got 
is first delivery of the plane in 1978. Replacements and upgrades for longtime 
customers are still big business for Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the years, the pool of foreign buyers has extended beyond NATO 
members to include Egypt, Indonesia, Bahrain and others. Foreign sales of the 
plane are conducted through the U.S. government. No American contractor can 
sell military equipment without State Department approval. 
</P>
<P>
 As F-16s have proliferated, they have surfaced in some odd places. Venezuela, 
which bought 24 of the planes in 1982, has used them to combat gold smugglers. 
The Turkish government is believed to have used F-16s to attack villages of 
Kurdish rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Turkey, neighboring Greece has also sought renewed orders of F-16s from 
Lockheed. The purchases reflect, in part, "a simmering, low-level arms race" 
between the two, said William Hartung, senior research fellow at the World 
Policy Institute in New York. Hartung is critical of the Lockheed sales. 
Watman, the Rand expert, said it can't be avoided. "I know this sounds cold, 
but would it make people feel better if we only sold them to Greece and the 
Turks bought (Russian-made) MIGs?" 
</P>
<P>
 F-16 sales have been a prickly matter between the U.S. and Pakistan. The U.S. 
interrupted delivery of the planes when a dispute flared over Pakistan's 
nuclear program. Pakistan later stopped payments, and the Fort Worth plant 
eventually canceled 43 planes from its backlog. Another agreement in 1992 to 
sell 150 F-16s to Taiwan caused a rift between the U.S. and China. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy over aircraft sales draws little comment from Lockheed. "These are 
foreign policy decisions and the (U.S.) government has their reasons for why 
they make these decisions," said Stout. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed and other defense contractors are pressing Congress to be less 
restrictive of aircraft exports and provide more money to finance purchases for 
countries short on cash. Although the 1991 Persian Gulf War sparked outrage 
over worldwide sales of military technology, opposition has softened as the 
debate turned to preserving jobs, said Lumpe, of the Arms Control Monitoring 
Project. The defense industry "turned this argument away from instability and 
death and warfare. . . . They've made it like selling toaster ovens or anything 
else," she said. Jets to Go 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed Corp.'s F-16 jet fighter was first introduced in 1978. The versatile 
plane remains a major source of revenue and Lockheed has an $11.2-billion 
backlog for 519 F-16 jet orders and service contracts. But U.S. Air Force 
purchases of F-16s are slated to dry up this year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, sales of the F-16 to foreign countries, with approval by the U.S. 
government, continues to be strong. In foreign markets, the single-engine F-16 
competes increasingly against a twin-engine rival, the FA-18, made by McDonnell 
Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the sales of F-16 fighter jets worldwide. Foreign contract 
figures include both jets on order, and those already delivered. Lockheed F-16

SUBWAY PROPOSAL WINS KEY RECOMMENDATION; TRANSIT: THE L.A. TRANSPORTATION 
DEPARTMENT REJECTS THE CHOICE OF AN ELEVATED TRAIN ACROSS THE VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Transportation recommended Monday that the City 
Council and the Mayor back a subway line across the San Fernando Valley instead 
of a rival plan for an elevated train above the Ventura Freeway, adding a 
powerful voice to the pro-subway camp in the lengthy debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation comes a week before the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority is scheduled to make a final decision on the politically contentious 
fight over which route and technology should be used for the mass transit line 
that will run east and west through the valley, connecting it to the Metro Rail 
subway to Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 In an analysis released Monday, the department said a mostly subway line 
parallel to Burbank and Chandler boulevards is superior because it would more 
easily integrated with existing bus lines, create less traffic congestion 
around stations and would be a less expensive choice if future funding problems 
force construction to proceed by short segments, among other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation is crucial in part because Mayor Richard Riordan -- a 
member of the MTA who also appointed three others on the 13-member panel -- has 
said that he would take into account the department's recommendation before 
rendering his own decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Riordan had voiced support for the elevated freeway line but has 
signaled that he may change his position based on the department's report, and 
today's vote on it by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Riordan said Monday that the mayor had yet to read the 
report and thus could not comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, subway supporters counted the recommendation as a key victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Edmund Edelman, a long-time supporter of the subway alternative, 
said he was elated by the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this helps the mayor and the City Council make a decision" in favor of 
the subway, he said. "How can they go against their experts?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very significant step," said Guy Weddington McCreary, a past president 
of the Universal City/North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which backs the 
subway option. "It's a pleasure to have the support of the City of Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 But the key proponent of the freeway alignment -- Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich -- blasted the report, saying it ignores a 1990 
referendum, in which valley voters backed a proposed freeway monorail over a 
subway line. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the first time that the Department of Transportation has ignored 
the will of the public," Antonovich said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted the recent tunneling troubles that have caused streets in 
Hollywood to sink as evidence that subway construction is too risky. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Hollywood sinking like the Titanic and the merchants likely to file a 
$1-billion class action lawsuit against the MTA, the last thing we want to 
happen is to export this type of disaster to the San Fernando Valley," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCreary called such criticism a "red herring." As long as construction is 
done properly, he said, subways are solid transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than five years, Valley residents and their elected representatives 
have engaged in a heated debated over the route and technology of a line that 
would connect the Valley with the Red Line subway to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As currently envisioned, the Ventura Freeway line would have 15 elevated stops 
between Universal City and Warner Center. Although no decision has been made on 
the technology, many supporters back a quiet, high-speed monorail for the line, 
and usually refer to their project as "the monorail." 
</P>
<P>
 The mostly subway alternative calls for an extension from North Hollywood to 
Woodland Hills with 10 stations. The MTA has already paid $159 million to 
acquire the right-of-way for the subway line. 
</P>
<P>
 There is not much difference in cost. According to an independent review 
released last month, a subway would be more expensive than the monorail by only 
$19 million -- less than 1% of the total cost of either project -- if open-air 
stations were built in some locations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the city's report Monday, Robert Yates, general manager of the department 
of transportation, said much of the previous analysis of the rail options have 
focused on cost estimates. But he said the city should consider other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Yates said, the Burbank-Chandler line would be closer to heavy 
population centers such as Pierce and Valley colleges and creates a new 
transportation corridor that could continue operating if the freeway corridor 
is damaged in a quake or other natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the subway line would be further north than the freeway alignment, he 
said, it would "provide a more effective linkage to existing north-south bus 
services." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said funding constraints may delay construction of the entire 
length of the line to Woodland Hills. If such delays occur, Yates said a subway 
could be built more cheaply in a shorter segment than an elevated line. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tom Silver, an Antonovich transportation aide, called this last point a 
"gross error," saying that recent studies show that the construction of short 
segments of either project would be nearly equal in cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "That makes you wonder about the motives of the report," he said.

CHECKING IT OUT; CHESS WHIZ AND MATE INTRODUCE ANCIENT GAME TO THE VIDEO 
GENERATION, AND SURPRISE!THEY'RE NOT BORED 
</P>

<P>
 The next Bobby Fischer could come from an unlikely place: the city's oldest 
elementary school, on the outskirts of a Latino barrio. 
</P>
<P>
 At Las Palmas Elementary School, the ancient game of chess has captured the 
imagination of a diverse student population. Here, knights are often called 
cabellos and rooks, with their slotted tops, are sometimes known as "ash 
trays." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is Eric Hicks, a Berkeley-educated chess whiz whom students have 
nicknamed the "Chess Master." 
</P>
<P>
 Every Wednesday, as many as 50 children stay after school to learn chess 
skills from Hicks and his wife, Laura Ariza, who is bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the club's adherents are Latino, with limited English skills, but 
it doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Once players grasp the game, language and cultural barriers tumble like a 
vulnerable king under attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chess transcends all languages -- I've taught deaf kids before," said Hicks, 
a 26-year-old high school dropout who later earned a bachelor's degree in 
English from UC Berkeley and now writes computer software programs from his San 
Clemente home for a Bay Area company. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyeglasses smudged and high-top sneakers untied, Hicks stood before his young 
charges last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular classes had just ended at 2 p.m., but learning started anew in a large 
room filled with about 35 students. Small heads topped with black, brown and 
blond hair nodded. A few hands fidgeted. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was time to play, the squirming stopped and the room fell still. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity for the kids to come together for the game itself," 
Principal Doug Kramer said. "They are not separated by language or race." 
</P>
<P>
 The game also has become an avenue to motivate students in their school work. 
</P>
<P>
 As sixth-grader Patrick Starr of Dana Point carefully studied the board, his 
mother commented on how her son has become more patient and methodical since 
taking up chess. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother said Patrick has a learning disability, but among chess club 
members, which include "gifted" students, he is one of the top three players. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been wonderful," Barbara Starr said. "It's helped his self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer said some students such as 11-year-old Patrick show promise in the 
chess club, which helps bolster teachers' efforts to reach them academically. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the principal was stunned at the turnout, but he credits Hicks, who 
recruited students in August before the club was launched. 
</P>
<P>
 "He instills the idea that if you want to get better, you have to put in more 
time," Kramer said. "And that's very important. Kids today are 'just add water 
-- instant everything,' but that's not what life's all about." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ariza, 24, who holds a bachelor's degree in anthropology from UC Berkeley and 
is a loan officer for a San Juan Capistrano bank, never competed in chess 
tournaments as her husband does. 
</P>
<P>
 But she knows the game plenty well, teaching the youngsters specialized moves 
and how to master them. 
</P>
<P>
 First, though, the students must know the names of pieces and how they 
traverse the board before moving on to the 150-year-old Ruy Lopez strategy.  
</P>
<P>
 "I give them the English name, but some of the students are limited in English 
so they assign nicknames or Spanish," said Ariza, whose parents came to the 
United States from the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 A king is rey and a queen is reina , Ariza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks, who has reached the chess level of expert, said he quit high school 
while living with his family in Hawthorne. He had played some chess while 
younger. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 18 he began playing chess seriously among the locals at Santa Monica 
beach and said he was surprised to find that some of the people he was beating 
were doctors and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I failed out of high school," Hicks said. "I was a terrible student. I never 
had anything in common with people like this. And suddenly I did." 
</P>
<P>
 He felt more confident. He entered El Camino College, then transferred to 
Berkeley, where he became an honors student, played on the chess team and 
taught the game to grammar-school children, earning enough money to support 
himself and pay tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he graduated the same year from UC Berkeley as the valedictorian from 
his high school. 
</P>
<P>
 When he looks at a chess board, Hicks sees the same qualities required for 
scholastic success. He imparts the advice to students, who religiously record 
each game in notebooks so they can not only review how they might have won or 
lost, but learn from mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do anything in chess, you have to take steps," Hicks said. "You just can't 
say, 'I want to win.' If it were just a game, I wouldn't do it."

TRICK OR TREAT WITHOUT O.J., BROWNS URGE; HALLOWEEN: THE SLAIN WOMAN'S FAMILY 
SAYS MASKS, WIGS ARE IN 'EXTREMELY BAD TASTE.' MOST COSTUME STORES TURN A DEAF 
EAR.

 The sister of Nicole Brown Simpson issued a nationwide plea Monday, asking 
people to return Halloween costume items that depict O.J. Simpson or his 
alleged victims, including masks, blond wigs and even prosthetic slit throats. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Brown called on stores handling such items to immediately halt their 
sale, saying that they are in "extremely bad taste" and hold "no redeeming 
value for our society." She was joined in the protest by Human Options, a 
domestic violence support group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murder and domestic violence are no laughing matter," Brown said in a 
statement. "And the total disrespect for grieving families in general is 
appalling." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown issued the nationwide challenge on behalf of her and Nicole Brown 
Simpson's family, who live in Dana Point. Brown and her sister -- Simpson's 
ex-wife and the woman he's accused of killing -- grew up in Orange County and 
graduated from Dana Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "Halloween has always been a children's holiday," Denise Brown said. "It is a 
holiday where children dress up and have a good time pretending to be someone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 But most stores turned a cold shoulder to her remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Pahl, the manager of Ragztop-Vintage in Fullerton, said Monday that his 
store had sold 70 masks in the likeness of O.J. Simpson, as well as numerous 
football jerseys splattered with fake blood and blond wigs for women "wanting 
to dress up as Nicole." 
</P>
<P>
 Pahl said that many of the sales had been to people from out of state -- not 
from Halloween trick-or-treaters but rather "collectors wanting an obvious 
collector's item." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had calls from all over the country," he said. "I've even had calls from 
South America and Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 Pahl said that he and the owner of the store had no intention of curtailing 
the Simpson line of Halloween gear, adding that Brown's plea doesn't faze them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big world out there," he said. "I'm bothered by a lot more things than 
that. There's a lot of tragedy in the world, and she has her own ax to grind. 
Look at Rwanda. A lot more people died in that, and any more, you don't hear a 
word about it. Where's the outrage in that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dena Teeter of Step In Time in Laguna Niguel said that she only recently began 
selling a mask that looks "exactly" like O.J. Simpson and had no plans to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dead ringer. It's him," she said, comparing it to a mask that more 
closely resembles boxer Mike Tyson and which Alan M. Dershowitz, a member of 
Simpson's defense team, has excoriated stores for selling while trying to pass 
it off as a Simpson mask. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have somebody come into my store who wants to buy an O.J. Simpson mask, 
what's the harm in selling that?" said Teeter, noting that the other items 
Denise Brown is criticizing -- blond and Afro-American wigs, fake slit throats 
and fake knives -- have been sold for years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vicki Gaon, the manager of Rental Boutique in Santa Ana, said she 
supported Brown "110%" and would clear her shelves of any items people might 
buy in "the sick hope" of masquerading as O.J. Simpson or his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's right. It's not a joke," Gaon said. "It's serious stuff, and I don't 
blame her. My mother died recently, and it's heartbreaking. It would have been 
even more so had it happened in a violent way." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Harold, owner of the Halloween Warehouse in San Diego, said that he's 
sold more than 100 O.J. Simpson masks, "which look exactly like him," for 
$49.99 each. He said that they were made weeks ago by a "private individual who 
has a garage operation in L.A. I'm not about to give out his name." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold said that Denise Brown's statement would not affect him or anyone he 
knew in the costume industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making fun of dead people is kind of a Halloween tradition," he said. "It's a 
tasteless business, but Halloween has no taste. It's all blood and gore." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Vivian Clecak, the founder and executive director of Human Options, 
blasted the Simpson Halloween trend for the message it sends to children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Costumes such as these are just one example of what has gone wrong with our 
society," Clecak said. "We must, as individuals, take a stand on what we will 
and will not accept."

SUIT ALLEGES RAT IN DIET PEPSI CAN MADE WOMAN ILL; COURTS: MEXICAN TEACHER SAYS 
THE TAINTED DRINK WAS BOUGHT IN BUENA PARK. SOFT-DRINK MAKER CALLS THE SCENARIO 
IMPROBABLE.

<P>
 A 22-year-old woman has sued the Pepsi Cola Co. and a grocery store chain, 
alleging that a can of Pepsi she bought contained a decaying rat. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Del Consuelo Lazaro's lawsuit filed Friday in Orange County Superior 
Court claims that, while visiting family in Buena Park in July, she took a 
drink of Diet Pepsi that she had bought at an Albertson's only to spit out some 
strange matter. A few hours later, according to the suit, she went to Anaheim 
General Hospital with extreme abdominal pains, diarrhea and vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff at the emergency ward opened the can and discovered a full-grown mature 
rat about the size of a fist, said Lazaro's attorney, Daniel Ramirez of Buena 
Park. The hospital later sent the can and its contents to the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration, which concluded that the rat was "canned at the Pepsi 
plant," Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Pepsi spokeswoman called the scenario of a canned rat improbable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's highly unlikely that any sort of animal could find its way into a canned 
soft drink because of our manufacturing process and the quality control that we 
do," spokeswoman Anne Ward said from Somers, N.Y., on Monday. "We need to 
determine whether the rat got into the can before or after it was opened." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "There are just some logical questions one has to ask. A can with 
something in it would have weighed more, and it would have been very noticeable 
that there was something wrong with it before it was consumed." 
</P>
<P>
 A manager at the Albertson's in Buena Park would not comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said that for his client, who is a teacher in Mexico, the incident 
"has changed her life and taken away her peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not what you're supposed to do to consumers. We're not supposed to 
have to open up every can and inspect it before we drink it."

FAST TIMES TURN DEADLY IN VILLAGE TRAGEDY; ACCIDENT: SILVERADO CANYON RESIDENT 
KILLED, TWO OTHERS INJURED WHEN FRIEND RACING ON NARROW ROAD SWERVES INTO THEM. 
BOTH DRIVERS ARE JAILED.

 Along the winding lanes of rustic Silverado Canyon, Shane Young had a 
reputation for driving fast -- and the speeding tickets to prove it. Jasmin 
Cook would have known that. The two were neighbors and close friends. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday night that friendship and this community's countrified calm were 
shattered, police said, when Young sped down the canyon in a race with another 
car and swerved into a trio of people, killing Cook, 20, and injuring two 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Young, 25, of Silverado Canyon, and the second driver, Clint 
Wamsley, 19, of Hesperia, were in Orange County Jail on suspicion of 
manslaughter and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  
</P>
<P>
 And Silverado Canyon was left grappling with a tragedy that, like much that 
goes on in this village of just 900, seemed to touch nearly everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of (sad) faces coming in here this morning," said Del Clark, 
who runs the Shadybrook Country Store. "Everybody's run down about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors placed flowers near the grim police markings, which showed the 
roadside spot where Cook was killed -- just 100 feet from her own house and a 
few blocks from Young's. Others shook their heads in shock as they gathered to 
compare notes and check on the two people who were injured in the 10:15 p.m. 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane Graham, 19, who lives across a dirt lane from Cook's house, was in 
stable condition at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. Timothy Smart, 21, who 
also grew up in the canyon, was in stable condition at the same hospital. 
Graham had severe chest bruising and Smart had a broken wrist and a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that Young, driving a Toyota pickup, was racing a Ford Mustang, 
driven by his friend Wamsley, west along Silverado Canyon Road. Wamsley slowed 
when he saw the three people heading in the same direction across the street, 
said California Highway Patrol spokeswoman Angel Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Young swerved into the opposite lane to avoid the Mustang and his truck struck 
the three victims near Shady Brook Drive, Johnson said. Cook was walking and 
the two men were on bicycles, riding slowly alongside her. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents scrambled out of their homes at the screech of brakes, some to find 
their own children had been struck. "My son . . . said, 'Mom, Mom, I've been 
hit,' " said Janet Malyszka, mother of Shane Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman next door to the crash site said she was awakened by screams. "A man 
was moaning, 'I killed them. I killed them,' " said Eileen Denin. 
</P>
<P>
 Futile attempts were made to resuscitate Cook. She was pronounced dead at 
Chapman General Hospital in Orange an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said Young was speeding -- perhaps exceeding 45 m.p.h. -- in a 
25-m.p.h. zone. Blood samples from both drivers would be tested for 
intoxicants. Young and Wamsley were each held on $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's mother, Diane Young, said her son told her he had not been racing. 
"There was no racing going on," she said, declining to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and neighbors reported having complained of Young's fast driving in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always told Shane and everyone else told Shane to slow down before you kill 
somebody. And that's what it took," said the dead girl's 17-year-old sister, 
Shana Cook, who said she used to date Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Young had been ticketed for speeding five times since March, 1993, according 
to the Department of Motor Vehicles. He also had been cited for not having his 
license with him and twice for not wearing a seat belt. Young also had been 
ticketed in 1988 for driving while his license was suspended or revoked, 
according to department records. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The incident sparked calls for speed humps and more speed-limit signs along 
the winding road that is the canyon's main artery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just Shane," said Robert Anthony, a friend who lives with the Cook 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotions ran high in the remote neighborhood. For several hours Monday, the 
accident scene on Silverado Canyon Road drew television and newspaper crews. At 
one point, several people who had gathered at the site roughed up a Times 
photographer, damaging his camera, exposing his film and pushing him to the 
ground before bystanders summoned sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's tragedy was tinged with dark irony -- all of those involved in the 
accident are longtime neighbors and acquaintances. Cook and Young were said to 
be the closest of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "She and Shane were really good friends -- really close," Anthony said. 
"Shane's got to deal with that, and the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony said Cook's mother was troubled to see Young, who had visited her 
house countless times, behind bars. "She doesn't want him in jail right now. 
She said, 'Why did they do this to him? Why did they have to take him away?' " 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony said Cook's parents are out of work and without money for the burial. 
He said a fund would be established to help them.  
</P>
<P>
 Shana Cook described her sister as bubbly and loving, but working to overcome 
personal problems and bored with isolated canyon living. Family members said 
Jasmin Cook used to work at the now-shuttered Pali Cafe but was not employed at 
the time of her death. She graduated from Richland High School in Orange in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was fun. I know she wasn't happy here though," Shana Cook said, sobbing 
near the site of her sister's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was trying so hard to get her life together," Shana Cook said. "I guess 
God made it easy for her."

SAN CLEMENTE ARSON PROBE FOCUSES ON MARINE; CRIME: INVESTIGATORS SAY A CAR LIKE 
HIS WAS SEEN LEAVING THE SITE OF A BRUSH FIRE. A RIFLE LOADED WITH TRACER 
BULLETS WAS FOUND IN HIS VEHICLE, REPORTS SAY. THE BLAZE CONSUMED MORE THAN 100 
ACRES OF BRUSH.

 A Camp Pendleton Marine was being investigated Monday in connection with a 
suspected arson after a car like his was spotted leaving the scene of a brush 
fire that consumed more than 100 acres here Sunday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Antonio Sanchez, 19, was arrested late Sunday in San Clemente after 
deputies found a loaded weapon in his red Dodge Stealth with Florida license 
plates, said sheriff's Sgt. Richard Downing. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle was seen by witnesses leaving Avenida Pico near Calle Amanecer 
shortly after the blaze broke out about 2:30 p.m., Capt. Dan Young of the 
Orange County Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like, 'Oh, this guy started the fire,' but it's not that simple," 
Young said. "We have not established that, in fact, this is the guy."  
</P>
<P>
 A deputy spotted Sanchez's car on North El Camino Real about 11 p.m. and 
pulled the vehicle over because it matched the description given by witnesses 
earlier, Downing said. A sniper rifle loaded with tracer bullets, a knife and 
brass knuckles were found in the vehicle, Downing said. Sanchez was booked at 
Orange County Jail on suspicion of possessing a loaded firearm and the brass 
knuckles. Bail had not been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the loaded rifle found in the car may have been used to 
shoot a tracer round that sparked the brush fire, Young said. The firing of a 
tracer round, a bullet that glows red in flight so that its trajectory can be 
seen, is prohibited in California except for military purposes, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In brush wild land, it's not only illegal, it's also a fire hazard," Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Corps Sgt. Janice Hagar, a Camp Pendleton spokeswoman, confirmed 
Sanchez is stationed there, but could not provide details of his rank or 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's fire blackened about 140 acres of wildlife habitat but did not 
threaten any homes, Young said.

GORBACHEV'S NEW MISSION; FORMER SOVIET LEADER BRINGS ENVIRONMENTAL MESSAGE TO 
HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev arrived in Hollywood on Monday for a 
two-day mission designed to advance the causes of Green Cross International, a 
nonprofit environmental organization he founded in 1993, two years after he was 
forced from office. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-governmental group -- with chapters in the United States, Russia, the 
Netherlands, Japan and Switzerland -- has a three-pronged program: cleaning up 
military toxins, assisting in the creation of global ecological law and 
fostering a value shift on the environment with the media's help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like perestroika . . . environmental awareness is about creating a different 
mentality in the same heads," Gorbachev said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though some elements of the Russian press are trying to create the impression 
that Mikhail Gorbachev is looking for a cause to be visible, my commitment goes 
way back," he said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev notes that he addressed the United Nations on the environment in 
1988 but, as long as natural resources were needed to fuel the arms race, it 
was hard to make environmental causes a priority. Practically and 
psychologically, he says, the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster was a turning 
point. So was Rio de Janeiro's 1992 United Nations Conference on the 
Environment and Development, two months after which he accepted an offer to 
become the founding president of Green Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 At a private luncheon at the Beverly Hills Green Acres Estate, Gorbachev 
spelled out the group's vision to 60 entertainment and business leaders, 
including Barbra Streisand, Ted Turner, grocery store magnate Ron Burkle and 
Diane Meyer Simon, president of Global Green USA, the U.S. chapter of 
Gorbachev's group. He then headed to the Raleigh Studios to appear on a special 
edition of the Channel One News, an in-classroom television network broadcast 
to 12,000 secondary schools nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Fielding questions by students from Oak Park High School in Agoura Hills and 
Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, the former Soviet leader strayed from the 
topic to discuss the challenges of his post-political life -- a period he said 
has been marked by "betrayal, treachery and lack of understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping short of throwing his hat back into the political ring in 1996, 
Gorbachev, 63, pledged to remain a leader of global and domestic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "The USSR has no tradition of 'former presidents,' " Gorbachev explained, his 
wife Raisa looking on. "No one is asking me to build a library. The only person 
who has been involuntarily retired was Mr. Khrushchev, and he was practically 
put under lock-and-key. In this sense, Mikhail Gorbachev is creating other 
revolution -- a change in our history. Many want me to keep silent and abandon 
my convictions . . . but that would be a different man. My continued activism 
is my victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev wound up his day with a keynote speech to the Environmental Media 
Assn. Awards fund-raiser, where he addressed a sellout crowd that included such 
celebrities as Steven Seagal, Quincy Jones and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Disney 
Chairman Michael Eisner presented the first annual Frank G. Wells Award to 
Audubon Society Productions, in memory of the Disney president who died in a 
helicopter accident in April. Lured by the Gorbachev name -- in combination 
with a program that featured Pulitzer Prize nominee and author Maya Angelou as 
host and entertainment by singer-environmental activist Carole King -- 
corporations such as Warner Bros. and HBO each forked out $25,000 for a table 
of 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turnout exceeded that of last year when Vice President Al Gore spoke," said 
Environmental Media Assn. President Andy Goodman, whose five-year-old group 
encourages incorporation of environmental themes into TV shows, feature films 
and music videos. "Gorbachev cuts a wide path. Fortunately, his agenda and ours 
happened to coincide." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying people in half the cities of the world drink contaminated water and 
breathe polluted air, he called for a universally binding code of environmental 
ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we were thinking how to multiply the weapons of nuclear overkill, we 
acted like barbarians digging a common grave," the former Soviet leader said. 
"Today, nature is taking its revenge for mankind's mistreatment of it -- for 
nature can well do without man. The time has come when we must finally stop the 
evil pursuits that are bound to have irreversible consequences, unless we are 
ready to be called 'Homo Non-Sapiens.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Coping with the problems of the 21st Century is a challenge not only to our 
minds but also to our souls," he concluded. "The demons that beset mankind were 
not brought here by some extraterrestrials. At a time when the religious 
foundations of our culture are wearing thin, new value systems are needed more 
than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Media Assn. event, held on a CBS Television City sound stage 
decorated in a rain forest motif, will be broadcast as a one-hour special on 
TBS on Sunday Oct. 23 at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners, by category: Warner Bros.' "Free Willy" (feature film); Fox 
Children's Network's "Red Planet" (movie of the week/miniseries); Fox 
Broadcasting Co.'s 'The Simpsons" (television episodic comedy); Fox's "The 
X-Files (television episodic drama); ABC's "Day One" (television news 
magazine); KERA-TV's "Your Toxic Trash" (television special); TBS' "The New 
Adventures of Captain Planet" (children's animated programming); and KCTS' 
"Disney Presents Bill Nye the Science Guy" (children's programming, live 
action).

MUSIC TO THE EARS; A STRADIVARIUS LOST FOR 27 YEARS RESURFACES, BUT WHO OWNS 
IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Back in 1967, David Margetts lost a violin that he had borrowed from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 He either left it in the back seat of his car and somebody swiped it, or he 
left it on the roof of his car and drove off -- he's not sure which. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the violin disappeared. Which would not have been such a big 
deal if it had not been the Duke of Alcantara Stradivarius, an $800,000 
instrument that is one of the most treasured violins in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night, after a mysterious odyssey of more than 27 years, UCLA got its 
Stradivarius back, at least for the time being. Teresa Salvato turned the 
violin over to school officials until legal ownership can be determined in the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 How Salvato came into possession of the precious instrument -- crafted from 
pine and maple by an aging Antonio Stradivari in 1732 for a Spanish nobleman in 
the service of King Don Carlos -- is part of a story that includes some careful 
detective work by a couple who own a violin repair shop in Petaluma. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Carla Shapreau, an attorney for the university, Margetts, then a 
second violinist with UCLA's resident Feri Roth Quartet, had been using the 
Stradivarius during a rehearsal in Hollywood on the night of Aug. 2, 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Margetts said he returned to his parked car about 10 p.m. At that point, he 
said, he either forgot that he had set the violin on the car roof before he 
drove off, or he left it in the back seat of the unlocked car while shopping 
for groceries at a convenience store in Pasadena a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, I stopped off at a restaurant," said Margetts, now a member of 
the music faculty at Cal State Fresno. "When I got back to the car, I noticed 
that the fiddle was gone. . . . It was like somebody had given me the Mona Lisa 
and I'd betrayed their trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Margetts said he drove frantically back to where the rehearsal had taken place 
in the hope he had left the violin there. No luck. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12:45 a.m., he notified Los Angeles police of the loss, telling them 
that the Stradivarius had been in a double case that also contained a 
1950s-vintage violin worth about $30,000 that was made by Ansaldo Poggi. 
</P>
<P>
 Notice of the missing instruments was dispatched to more than 100 pawn shops 
in the Los Angeles area and more than 50 major violin shops in the United 
States and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvato says that according to her former husband's family lore, it was about 
that same time that the husband's aunt, Nadia Tupica, spotted a bundle beside a 
freeway on-ramp that she thought might be a small child. When Tupica took a 
closer look, she found that the bundle was a case containing the two violins. 
</P>
<P>
 "That sort of matches the violins-left-on-the-top-of-the-car version," 
Shapreau said. "One of the (Tupica) family stories is that the violins ended up 
in a closet. I don't know why. Maybe she just didn't play the violin." 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, years passed, and in 1979, Tupica -- who has since died -- gave 
the violins to her nephew, Jefferson Demarco, and his then-wife, Salvato. More 
time passed and the couple divorced, with Salvato receiving the violins as part 
of the divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salvato, a violinist, eventually lent the Stradivarius to her music teacher, 
Michael Sand. Last January, seeing that the instrument needed some minor 
repairs, Sand brought it to the Petaluma shop of Joseph Grubaugh and his wife, 
Sigrun Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
 "That violin is very distinctive, and they are experts in the field of 
authentication of fine Italian violins," Shapreau said. "They found a photo of 
the violin, which established which one it was, and they consulted a missing 
property registry that listed it as missing since 1967." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple called Shapreau -- who plays and makes violins when she is not 
pursuing her legal career -- and on her advice, they notified UCLA. In the 
meantime, she said, the couple gave the violin back to Sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapreau says the university tried for 10 months to talk Salvato into 
returning the instrument, but she had refused. 
</P>
<P>
 According to legal documents filed in the case, a university police sergeant 
asked her where the violin was, and "she stated that she was not stupid enough 
to keep the violin at (her) residence. . . . She then requested in a hostile 
manner that we leave her property." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to get Salvato to part with the Stradivarius, UCLA went to court, 
winning on Friday her agreement to surrender the instrument Monday for 
safekeeping until the court decides who can keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the still-missing Poggi violin, Shapreau said it may be some time 
before efforts to recover it are pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not even sure who owned it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, after the violin was authenticated by expert Michael Weishaar, 
Salvato surrendered it to officials at UCLA's Fowler Museum and left without 
talking to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful," said Eric K. Behrens, another attorney representing UCLA. 
"Even from the pictures, I didn't expect it to be that beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Margetts expressed his relief after 27 long years of worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy," he said. "It's congratulations to the world."

2 OFFICERS GUILTY IN GUNPLAY ON FREEWAY; COURTS: PAIR ARE CONVICTED OF GROSS 
NEGLIGENCE, THE LESSER OF THREE COUNTS. JUROR SAYS CHP OFFICER WAS NOT 
CONVINCING WHEN HE TESTIFIED THAT OFF-DUTY POLICEMEN FIRED AT HIM. 
</P>

<P>
 A pair of Los Angeles policemen who had been accused of firing on a California 
Highway Patrol officer during a drunken, off-duty shooting spree were convicted 
Monday of gross negligence in discharging their firearms, but found innocent on 
more serious charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Teyechea and Michael Herrera, nine-year veterans of the LAPD, sighed as 
the seven-man, five-woman jury read their verdict regarding the Feb. 9 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Teyechea had testified that he had gone out drinking after learning that, for 
the second straight year, no one in the department would be getting a pay 
raise. He said he was on his way with Herrera to another bar when he fired out 
the window of their pickup truck in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Barry Levin, told the jury that the act was "the most painfully 
stupid thing he had ever done in his life." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Steinfeld argued that the officers were 
doing more than simply letting off steam when they fired 21 times as they sped 
along the Harbor and Artesia freeways. Although Teyechea and Herrera later 
denied aiming at the CHP officer who eventually chased them down, Steinfeld 
told the jury that the two policemen fired on their pursuer in an attempt to 
scare him away. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP Officer Scott Wall said the defendants intentionally turned their weapons 
on him after he heard gunshots coming from their truck on the Harbor Freeway 
and gave chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing he was under attack by a truckload of gangbangers, Wall said he 
could see the powder flash from the gun barrels and could hear bullets zing by 
as he edged closer to the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 After a chase that reached speeds of 75 m.p.h., the officers stopped at a red 
light at the end of the Artesia Freeway in Gardena, Wall testified. The CHP 
officer said he pulled his service revolver and "screamed for both men to put 
their hands up." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to kill (the driver)," the officer testified, when he heard 
Herrera call out: "We're cops, man! We're cops!" 
</P>
<P>
 Later Teyechea and Herrera told authorities they had been drinking for five 
hours before the incident and had not seen Wall, who was not hit by any of the 
gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial became a contest over the credibility of the three officers. At one 
point, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge George Trammell III waited until he was 
outside the jury's presence, then told the lawyers involved that the CHP 
officer's account was "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Trammell said he doubted the jury would uphold any charges except the one 
involving negligence. The officers also had been charged with assault with a 
deadly weapon and shooting at an unoccupied vehicle. Trammel added that if the 
two officers were convicted on all three counts, he would exercise his option 
to overturn the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the jury agreed with the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Anthony Young, 26, said that although some of the jurors thought the 
LAPD officers were firing at Wall, the latter was unconvincing on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody felt that they did it, but it was Wall's word against theirs," 
Young said, and "his story was inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinfeld said she was satisfied with the verdict. The negligence charge, she 
noted, is a felony that could bring a maximum sentence of three years 
imprisonment for Herrera and three years and eight months in prison for 
Teyechea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jurors always have a difficult time when the defendant is a police officer, 
no matter what the charges are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "I hope that it sends a message to all of Los Angeles, not just 
police officers. You can't just go out drinking and shoot your guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing for Teyechea and Herrera was set for Nov. 15 in Trammell's court. 
The two men, who have been suspended without pay since the incident, will now 
face internal disciplinary procedures by the department.

SOME SEE NEW ACTIVISM IN HUGE MARCH; PROTEST: LEADERS OF SUNDAY'S DEMONSTRATION 
AGAINST PROP. 187 PREDICT SURGE OF POLITICAL ENERGY AMONG LATINOS. THE 
MEASURE'S BACKERS CALL THE EVENT A DISPLAY OF MEXICAN NATIONALISM THAT BOLSTERS 
THEIR CASE. 
</P>

<P>
 A day after the largest demonstration in recent Los Angeles history, 
enthusiastic organizers and participants exuded optimism Monday about a new 
political activism that would energize an increasingly diverse Latino 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the beginning of a new era of civil rights struggle -- headed by 
Latino immigrants," said Fabian Nunez, a Pomona-based activist and one of the 
march coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
 But to proponents of Proposition 187, the hotly debated immigration measure on 
the November ballot, the march was an outrageous display of Mexican nationalism 
that bolsters the case for reducing immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time they're flying Mexican flags, it helps us," concluded Alan C. 
Nelson, Proposition 187 co-author. 
</P>
<P>
 While an impressive organizational spectacle, Sunday's massive march from the 
Eastside to Downtown has left many questions in its wake. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers tended to emphasize the long-range benefits in marshaling 
solidarity and building coalitions among all Latinos, both immigrant and 
U.S.-born, for anticipated future battles at a time when the U.S. public is 
increasingly hostile to immigration.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our political history is just beginning, and this (march) is part of our 
beginning," said Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Hernandez, who was among the 
column of marchers that the police estimated at nearly 70,000. "I thought the 
march was a tremendous statement. . . . I think there's no question in my mind 
that the silent majority is ready to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers are planning a 1996 march on Washington shortly before the next 
presidential election, a kind of immigrant reprise of the landmark 1963 civil 
rights march. Before then, they hope to register 6 million new voters, mostly 
immigrants who are now signing up for citizenship in record numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 But such ambitious goals may be difficult to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican nationals, by far the largest group of Latino immigrants, have 
traditionally been hesitant to renounce allegiance to their homeland and become 
U.S. citizens -- the only way that immigrants can vote. If the march and other 
organizational activities motivate more to become citizens and participate, 
Latino activists agree, it will surely be judged a success in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people see the link between this demonstration and the electoral process, 
then the march will have a great benefit," said Harry Pachon, president of the 
Tomas Rivera Center, a public policy institute at the Claremont Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Latinos make up 25% of the state's population, they constitute only 
about a tenth of the state's registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Looming on the Nov. 8 ballot is Proposition 187, which, among other things, 
would bar illegal immigrants from receiving public-school educations and 
tax-supported, non-emergency health care and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on the historic march, many participants spoke of an updated 
version of the Chicano movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which resulted in a 
certain degree of political empowerment for Latinos -- but this time with a 
much stronger immigrant input. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Chicano movement was far different -- and in some ways less complex -- 
than current plans to marshal the vast Latino immigrant population that has 
arrived since the 1980s. It also unfolded during the tumultuous Vietnam War 
era. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Chicano movement was largely limited to U.S. citizens, today's 
organizers face the daunting challenge of encouraging eligible millions of 
foreign nationals to sign up for citizenship -- and then persuading them to 
register and vote, despite the widespread voter apathy already apparent in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Chicano movement took root among a Mexican American population 
considerably less diverse than today's extremely heterogenous Latino 
population. High immigration has greatly increased the numbers of Latinos 
residing in the United States but born in Mexico, Central America and other 
nations from the Caribbean to South America. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last 25 years, we have seen a real redefinition of the Latino 
community," noted Gloria Romero, a professor of Chicano studies at Loyola 
Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Chicano movement was largely led by students, Romero noted, the 
leadership behind Sunday's march is much more broad-based and includes recent 
immigrants, more women and older activists. And their organizing goals are more 
sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to 187 has also galvanized Latino students, who have staged 
statewide rallies, teach-ins, classroom boycotts and voter registration drives 
on college and high school campuses. For many of them, Sunday's march 
represented a chance to participate in an action of historic magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read about these things for years," said Angel Cervantes, who studies the 
history of social movements at Claremont Graduate School and is the son of 
Mexican immigrants. "But it wasn't until yesterday that I felt involved in a 
mass movement of people. People of my generation haven't experienced that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given the complexity of the Latino population, it is perhaps not surprising 
that serious divisions are already evident. Ironically, Sunday's march served 
to underline deep rifts: Many Latino activists had sought to cancel it, viewing 
such a march as a bad idea just three weeks before the election.  
</P>
<P>
 Some feared a sea of Mexican flags and brown faces in Downtown Los Angeles 
could only reinforce voters' concerns about a state that has experienced a 
dramatic -- and, to many, extremely unsettling -- demographic shift since the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people felt that the more visible we are, the more difficult it may 
become to beat this initiative," noted one Latino activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Taxpayers Against 187, the leading opposition group, 
declined to assess the march's repercussions. "It's difficult to assess whether 
it helps or hurts us at this point," said Scott MacDonald, a spokesman. "It's 
time to move on." But the images from the march clearly angered some voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a lot of Mexican flags, I see a lot of Spanish writing, and I don't 
like it," said Carol Sledge, a 45-year-old African American mother and resident 
of San Bernardino who said the march helped her make up her mind to vote in 
favor of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-187 camp quickly seized upon the march as ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people certainly have a right to protest, but I don't believe in using 
a foreign flag," said Jesse Laguna, a Mexican American with a San Diego-area 
group called the Border Solution Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna is among a majority of Latino registered voters, who, polls show, 
support Proposition 187. He sees no place for himself in what organizers term a 
new coalition of Southern California Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding the many differences in the Latino community, march organizers 
spoke of unity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize the imperative that we all come together," said Juan Jose 
Gutierrez, an Eastside political activist and march coordinator. "That's what 
the people want and that's what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 From a practical standpoint, independent observers said that the march could 
bolster support among those angered by what many will view as an expression of 
Mexican nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the cold reality of politics," said political analyst Sherry Bebitch 
Jeffe, "the pictures that went out on the front pages and on television may 
have well energized proponents of the proposition."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Department heads in the city will now report to City Manager Greg Hulsizer. 
They will also be hired by Hulsizer, who has been working for the city for a 
little over a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted last week to amend the city code, which requires that 
the council hire all department heads, such as the directors for public works 
and community services. 
</P>
<P>
 The city decided to revise the city manager's powers at a workshop in 
December, 1993. Hulsizer said it is standard procedure in most cities for 
department heads to be hired by the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 A contract establishing levels of compensation, severance pay and other 
benefits also will be drawn up between the city manager and the department 
heads under the new ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hulsizer is not invincible, as Councilman Harry Dotson pointed out just 
before voting: The city manager is under contract by the City Council and must 
report to the council. TOM RAGAN

 Art Teacher Learns Life's Hardest Lessons 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Lee Wong was creating intricate illustrations as a technical 
artist for a top corporation. Then a drunk driver plowed into his car. 
</P>
<P>
 After five back surgeries, the 39-year-old Irvine resident is still learning 
how to walk again, and his hand still shakes uncontrollably when he holds a 
brush. But during the past five years, Wong has earned a teaching credential 
and dreams of becoming a high school art teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a technical illustrator, detail is very important," said Wong, who had 
left Hughes Aircraft for a promising career at Nissan Motor Corp. several 
months before the December, 1989, accident. "It's like a surgeon -- your career 
is over when you can't use your hands anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said he was drowning in self-pity when his girlfriend, just beginning her 
teaching career, suggested that he teach art to her students. "She told me I 
had to stop feeling sorry for myself," Wong said. "I could no longer paint like 
I used to, so it was tough." 
</P>
<P>
 After he began teaching part-time at an elementary school in La Puente, Wong 
was inspired to become a teacher by a 6-year-old boy suffering from a brain 
tumor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I was the best thing that had ever happened to him," Wong said. "He 
said when he grew up, he wanted to be a teacher just like me and teach me how 
to paint again." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong returned to college, graduating in June with a teaching credential from 
Cal State Long Beach. He married his girlfriend and by August had five offers 
to teach high school art. But he suffered additional complications from his 
back injury and had to turn down the job offers. He has not given up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm learning how to walk again, and I'm determined to become a teacher," Wong 
said. "This is my dream -- I'm going to do it."RUSS LOAR

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; U.S. WON'T 
FIGHT RULING REINSTATING GAY NAVY MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration won't fight a federal appeals court ruling that 
upheld a Los Angeles judge's reinstatement of a Navy man who said he was gay, 
it was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The government let pass Friday's deadline for filing an appeal, which 
virtually assures Naval Petty Officer Volker Keith Meinhold's active status, 
said John McGuire, an attorney for the 13-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 2 1/2 years, the Pentagon has fought tooth and nail to kick me out of the 
Navy because I'm gay," Meinhold said. "By this decision, they finally have 
admitted that I can say I'm gay and proudly serve my country in the military."  
</P>
<P>
 Meinhold's lawyer predicted that the decision in his client's case is the 
beginning of the end of the Administration's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.  
</P>
<P>
 Meinhold's sexual preference became known publicly on May 19, 1992, when, in 
response to a question, he told ABC World News Tonight: "Yes, I am, in fact, 
gay."  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. ruled the statement alone did not 
violate the Pentagon's former regulations against homosexual conduct.  
</P>
<P>
 The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Hatter's ruling, but struck down 
his decision to extend it to the entire country. The military's inaction means 
the ruling is the law in the nine western states and two territories in the 
ninth district.  
</P>
<P>
 No one from the Pentagon was available for comment on the decision to allow 
the deadline to pass.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COLLEGE DISTRICT, UNION 
NEAR PACT ON EARLY RETIREMENT OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Community College District is nearing agreement with union 
officials on an early retirement package that could spur the departure of up to 
20% of its full-time faculty, according to Chancellor Neil Yoneji. 
</P>
<P>
 If enough older full-time teachers opt for the incentive, officials said, the 
result would be an opportunity to reinvigorate the district's academic programs 
and diversify its faculty through the mass replacement hiring that would occur. 
Currently, about 70% of the full-time faculty is white, even though the 
district's college-age population is about 70% minority. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also hopes to save money. The theory is that the cost of 
providing the bonus to retiring faculty members would be more than offset by 
the salary savings from hiring new teachers at lower pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity for us to do a restructuring and yet also give employees 
who have spent a long time in this district a better opportunity to retire," 
said Yoneji, who oversees the district's nine campuses and nearly 104,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal being discussed with the American Federation of Teachers 
College Guild, the incentive would be offered to about 700 of the district's 
more than 1,500 full-time teachers -- all those age 55 or older. Faculty union 
President Leon Marzillier estimated that 200 to 300 of those might accept the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has an unusually large share of older faculty because of the boom 
in hiring that occurred in the 1960s and early 1970s. Two-thirds of the 
district's full-time faculty is 50 or older, according to statistics provided 
by Marzillier. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, officials had hoped to offer the retirement package immediately, 
with the retirements taking effect at the end of the fall semester. But the 
move has been delayed so that any retirements would occur at the end of the 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, faculty members would get 7% of their final basic salary 
in an annual lifetime annuity in addition to their regular pension benefit. For 
the program to proceed, at least 125 faculty members must participate. 
</P>
<P>
 A top-scale teacher in the district without a doctorate currently earns a 
salary of about $50,550, union officials said. Normally, such a person retiring 
with 30 years of experience would get a 60% pension, or about $30,330 a year. 
The incentive would add more than $3,500 a year to that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials reportedly are considering offering a similar package to 
senior administrators and staff members. JOHN CHANDLER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; UCI SCIENCE CONFAB FOR MINORITY STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Engineers, teachers, volunteers and others are invited to gather at a free 
conference at UC Irvine about ways to encourage minority students to enter 
scientific and mathematical fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting Friday is organized by Project SMART -- Science and Mathematics 
Articulated Roads Toward Teaching -- a UCI education department effort to 
attract underrepresented students to become science and math teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 When compared to all undergraduate students across the country, only 
one-fourth as many minority undergraduate students pursue science and math 
degrees, said Alan Hoffer, UCI Department of Education director. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some role models out there teaching in the sciences, but not 
enough," said Sonia Mucarsel, program coordinator. "We want to create teachers 
as role models who can encourage other students." 
</P>
<P>
 A few of those role models will speak at the conference, Mucarsel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers include: Eloy Rodriguez, a former UCI professor and botanist who 
teaches at Cornell University; Eugene Cota-Robles, professor emeritus at UC 
Santa Cruz; Manuel N. Gomez, UCI associate vice chancellor of academic affairs; 
and George Castro, former president of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos 
and Native Americans in Science. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is funded by a grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts, Mucarsel 
said, and Southern California Edison Co. helped sponsor the conference. 
Conference attendees will be able to explore Southern California Edison's 
mobile science classroom and hands-on science experiments, Mucarsel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference is scheduled from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. in the Emerald Bay A 
Room of the UCI Student Center. Parking is $4. For more information, call (714)

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY LIBRARY TO OPEN IN SPRING AT 
SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first new city library branch in 25 years is expected to open next spring 
to serve residents near Oak View School. 
</P>
<P>
 "This particular branch is unique because it is located in one of the most 
underprivileged and low-economic areas," said Ron Hayden, library services 
director."It's in an area that certainly needs assistance in terms of 
educational facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The library will offer family literacy and children's programs, Hayden said. 
The 2,000-square-foot prefabricated building will be built at Oak View School, 
17241 Oak Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theme is to get the families involved in the child's education by putting 
a library in that area," he said. "This is an opportunity to expand their 
educational opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak View School Principal Julie Stein said children and parents are thrilled 
to have a library in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just enhancing and reinforcing everything we are trying to do here," 
Stein said. "They will have this world of books and computers right in their 
back yard, and it will open new worlds they wouldn't have otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, parents raised about $500 for the library by cooking and selling 
Mexican food, Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has approved the selection of a contractor and the 
expenditure of $250,000 in federal grant money to build the library. Hayden 
said the library's operating budget will come from grant money and community 
donations, and volunteers will help staff the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans are awaiting state approval, Hayden said, because the library will 
be built on school property.DEBRA CANO

EX-PETROLEUM FIRM OFFICIAL SENTENCED IN EMBEZZLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ex-director of finance of USA Petroleum Corp. in Agoura Hills was 
sentenced to 33 months in prison Monday for embezzling nearly $2.4 million from 
the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima ordered Marvin Jay Caukin, 46, of Palos 
Verdes, to repay the entire amount, and also fined him $25,000. Caukin pleaded 
guilty in June to four counts of wire fraud, Assistant U.S. Atty. Dorothy 
Shubin said.  
</P>
<P>
 Caukin admitted funneling the money from his employer and several of its 
entities to secret bank accounts during a 22-month period that began in July, 
1992, Shubin said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WALNUT PARK; ORIENTAL 
FRUIT FLIES FOUND; BAIT TO BE PUT OUT TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four Oriental fruit flies were found near Walnut Park in Los Angeles County 
late last week and over the weekend, and an eradication effort over 12 square 
miles is scheduled to begin today.  
</P>
<P>
 The male insects were trapped in guava and orange trees, near the intersection 
of Firestone Boulevard and Wilmington Avenue, said spokeswoman Carla Agar of 
the California Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 The department, working with Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner Leon 
Spaugy, will begin eradication treatments in the area Tuesday, using a 
technique known as male annihilation.  
</P>
<P>
 About 600 bait stations per square mile, containing a methyl eugenol-Naled 
mixture, will be applied to utility poles, street trees and other unpainted 
surfaces, such as fences, using pressurized tree-marking guns.  
</P>
<P>
 Methyl eugenol attracts the male fruit fly and Naled is an insecticide that 
kills the fly when it lands on the bait station. The boundary is 12 square 
miles around the areas of the find. State officials said they will repeat the 
treatment every two weeks, for a minimum of four applications.  
</P>
<P>
 The Oriental fruit fly, established in Southeast Asia and most of the Pacific 
Islands, is similar to the Mediterranean fruit fly and can cause extensive 
damage to fruits, vegetables and ornamental plants, Agar said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; $382,000 
IN GRANTS GIVEN BY ATHLETIC FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Amateur Athletic Foundation has awarded $382,048 in grants to 11 Southern 
California organizations devoted to bringing sports opportunities to area 
youngsters.  
</P>
<P>
 The New Alternatives for Drug and Gang Elimination Youth Development Program, 
or New ADAGE, of Los Angeles received $187,450. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten other programs in areas extending from San Diego to Santa Barbara counties 
received grants ranging from $3,200 to $82,800.  
</P>
<P>
 New ADAGE will expand its organized sports programs and competitions in 
basketball, softball and flag football from 12 to 15 junior high and middle 
school campuses in the Los Angeles inner city area, said Amateur Athletic 
Foundation spokesman Barry Zepal. Almost all the rest of the money will go 
toward sports equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amateur Athletic Foundation is endowed with Southern California's share of 
a surplus in funds from the 1984 Olympic Games. It has invested more than $60 
million since its inception to provide sports for youngsters, Zepal said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE ; CITY WAIVES SHELTER BUILDING PERMIT FEES

<P>
 A nonprofit organization building a shelter for battered women in the city has 
gotten a $21,000 head start from council members who agreed to waive 
construction permit fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Human Options, a nonprofit organization that offers counseling services and 
shelter to battered women and their children in Irvine and Laguna Beach, is 
building a $3.5-million shelter in Irvine.The organization's first Irvine 
shelter, it will house 40 women and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members unanimously agreed last week to forgive fees for building, 
grading, landscaping and fire sprinkler permits. The city may pay for the 
expense through community development block grants. But city officials said 
they will wait until early next year to decide how to account for the loss of 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Paula Werner expressed concern that the city lacks a policy 
governing the approximately $25,000 in fees that are waived each year for 
charitable groups. The council agreed to develop a comprehensive policy on the 
subject early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council action allows Human Options to begin construction. The 
location of the new shelter will be kept secret in order to guard the safety of 
the women who will stay there. 
</P>
<P>
 Human Options, a 12-year-old organization, has raised $2 million toward the 
cost of the new shelter so far. The land was donated by the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter will offer financial planning, job placement and legal services to 
abused women and temporary shelter from 30 to 90 days. In May, the City Council 
awarded a $525,000 federal grant to the organization for construction of the 
new shelter. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; POLICE WILL ENFORCE ANTI-SCAVENGING LAW

 The Police Department will start enforcing the scavenger ordinance, which 
prohibits people from picking through trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors for the city's sanitary district announced the 
stepped-up enforcement at its monthly meeting last week.Violators can be fined 
up to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin B. Hamers, the manager of the district, said the police have promised to 
crack down on what has become a widespread problem in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of now, we have an active Police Department enforcing the scavenging 
incident," said Hamers. "And we plan on sending more complaints over to the 
department and suggesting which (scavenger) routes they should look out for." 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents have complained in the past two months about the scavengers, 
who go through the garbage in search of recyclables. Some double park their 
cars and pickup trucks, causing traffic hazards, while others conduct their 
searches in the middle of the night, waking residents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman told Florine Reichle, the assistant manager of the district, that 
scavengers had sifted her trash, found old checks from a closed account, then 
wrote hot checks around town until police arrested them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is more serious than it seems," said Reichle. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the anti-scavenging ordinance was adopted by the city in 1992, it has 
not been rigorously enforced, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Roy June said it is important that the district monitor the 
citations after they are issued by police, then follow up on the court 
appearances to see what fines are levied by judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys will accept citations all day long if it's only 10 bucks," he 
said.TOM RAGAN

 Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian has dedicated a 20-foot-wide strip of land 
on a bluff above West Coast Highway to the city of Newport Beach as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 The contribution is part of the hospital's development agreement with the 
city, which permitted construction of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The future parkland, below Hoag's lower campus overlooking a frenzy of reeds 
and pampas grass plumes, begins at the hospital's Cancer Center and runs north 
to Superior Avenue. The entire strip is next to a bicycle path. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital will bear the costs of landscaping and making sure old oil wells 
are properly capped. 
</P>
<P>
 No specific planning or landscaping has been done yet. City officials will 
consider whether to install trees and/or benches, Advance Planner Patricia 
Temple said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mini-park gives west Newport a small dose of much sought open space. Many 
west Newport residents hope to see the nearby Newport Oil Co. property 
converted into a park. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS CENTRAL: GARDEN GROVE; COLSON: FIGHT CRIME WITH 'MORAL 
REJUVENATION' 
</P>

<P>
 Charles Colson, the late President Richard Nixon's special counsel who spent 
time in prison for his part in the Watergate scandal, told more than 450 people 
at a fund-raiser Monday that the country needs a "moral rejuvenation" to help 
fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 problem in America today isn't the economy; it's crime" said 
Colson, 63."Prisons aren't rehabilitating. Crime is the result of a moral 
breakdown in society." 
</P>
<P>
 The $25-a-plate luncheon at the Hyatt Regency in Garden Grove raised money and 
support for the local chapter of Prison Fellowship, a Christian organization 
that ministers to prisoners, ex-prisoners and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secular world still believes tougher laws, more cops and prisons can curb 
crime," Colson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't have a moral rejuvenation which comes through the Gospel, we 
can't fight crime in America." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, Colson spent seven months in a federal prison for obstructing justice 
during Watergate investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 After a religious conversion, Colson said, he confessed leaking damaging 
documents about a prominent anti-war activist to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he founded Prison Fellowship Ministries in 1976, Colson has traveled to 
hundreds of prisons across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Prison Fellowship program is Project Angel Tree, in which church 
members donate Christmas presents to children of inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison system "just doesn't work," Colson said. "I felt it was God's call 
to come and do all this." NANCY HSU

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 'GAYRADIO' VARIETY PROGRAM TO RETURN

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a one-year hiatus, Irvine Valley College student Chris Vollentine is 
bringing his "GayRadio" program back to the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The variety show will be broadcast from midnight to 1 a.m. Wednesday mornings 
on KWIZ-FM 96.7 starting this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin resident, who calls himself Chris Creem on the radio, said his 
program will alternate between serious and entertaining topics that are 
designed to appeal to gays and lesbians of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Included will be news, humor, interviews with gay activists and selections of 
the latest club music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the program is really important; that's why I'm compelled to start it 
again," said Vollentine, who hopes to "break down the closet door" by 
encouraging gays and lesbians to be comfortable publicly with their sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be pretty up front and in your face and in your house," Vollentine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Vollentine produced his "GayRadio" show in a two-hour Saturday 
night slot on KWIZ, a Pasadena station that broadcasts to Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually shelved the program due to a lack of commercial sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 By cutting the show in half and spending more time on promotion, Vollentine 
hopes to make this new version of "GayRadio" a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, this time I won't quit my day job," he added. ALAN EYERLY

 Ki Hyun Kim watched intently as a group of actors from South Coast Repertory 
delivered a lesson in responsibility Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-year-old Parks Junior High School student said the performance was 
unlike "unrealistic TV shows like 'Beverly Hills 90210.'" 
</P>
<P>
 "When your friend's going through a serious family problem, you don't have to 
have an answer for them," Kim said. "You just have to be there for them." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the point of the 25-minute play, "Make the Break" by Jervey Tervalon, 
in which Garvey (Phil LaMarr) is so self-absorbed that he ignores the needs of 
his friend, whose sister is dying in a hospital. Garvey realizes he needs to 
listen to his grieving friend and support him. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance was part of South Coast Repertory's four-week tour of Orange 
and Los Angeles county schools. Repertory spokesman Cristofer Gross said the 
tour has two purposes: bringing live theater to schools and teaching a lesson 
in "growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 For the students of Parks Junior High, the play was part of a 10-week program 
meant to teach eighth-graders how to resolve problems, break apart stereotypes, 
analyze hate crimes and communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the students got the message about listening and how not to be so 
self-centered," said history teacher Irene Strauss. "We'll be discussing the 
play in class and how it relates to them in school and in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Denning, 13, said she learned a valuable lesson from the play: "We've got 
to face up to our problems and try to do the right thing."MIMI KO

 Corona del Mar's dramatic coastline would have a different look if some 
turn-of-the-century developers had their way. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1904, developers proposed construction of an ornate bathhouse and pavilion 
near the area's rugged coastline, with its jagged cliffs and rounded coves. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they wanted to build dozens of furnished tents on the beach that 
would be rented. 
</P>
<P>
 Both projects died, however, when the Pacific Electric Railway decided not to

 When Bathgate Elementary School second-grader Shaun Poe bounced a big red 
rubber ball toward his classmates Monday afternoon, they had trouble catching 
it and throwing it back. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency medical technicians had suited Poe's classmates with temporary arm 
or leg splints, bound their fingers together or outfitted them with walkers and 
wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose was to give them an idea of what life is like for people with 
physical disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to move," complained Donald Porter, 7, as he struggled to get a 
wheelchair rolling. Donald said the experience taught him that while it is 
harder to get around because of a disability, children with disabilities are 
the same as children without them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the attitude that Shaun's mother, Cyrene, hoped the children would 
develop in the hourlong Physically Challenged Awareness Program session that 
she created. She came up with the idea when several students picked on and 
laughed at Shaun, who has cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to show the kids that even if a kid has a handicap, he is still 
fun," said Poe, a respiratory therapist with MedTrans, an ambulance services 
company that provided the medical technicians. "Disabled kids still eat ice 
cream and want friends." 
</P>
<P>
 MedTrans spokeswoman Tara Regan said Poe hopes to expand the program to other 
elementary schools. The session also includes a discussion of famous people who 
have become successful despite physical disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know an hour or two isn't going to make the kids completely empathetic," 
Regan said. "But we just want to make them to stop and think when they see a 
disabled person that that person really isn't all that different." LYNN FRANEY

BUS AND BLUE LINE FARE INCREASES KEPT ON HOLD; TRANSIT: FEDERAL JUDGE AGAIN 
PROHIBITS HIKES AND RETAINS MONTHLY PASSES PENDING MTA'S APPEAL TO 9TH CIRCUIT 
COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fares on Metropolitan Transportation Authority buses and the Blue Line trolley 
will remain at $1.10, at least temporarily, as a federal judge Monday set a 
hearing for later this month on a suit alleging that a fare hike would 
disproportionately affect poor and minority bus riders. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. effectively left intact a court order 
he issued last month prohibiting the MTA from increasing the fare on buses to 
$1.35 and on the Blue Line trolley between Los Angeles and Long Beach to $2.35. 
The MTA was also barred from eliminating popular monthly passes. 
</P>
<P>
 After a five-minute hearing, Hatter ruled that he was "without jurisdiction" 
to modify his court order while the MTA is appealing the fare rollbacks to the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.  
</P>
<P>
 Hatter, however, set an Oct. 27 hearing on the larger question of whether the 
MTA is discriminating against poor and minority bus riders to fund rail lines 
that mostly benefit affluent white commuters. The future of the fare hike rests 
on that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday's hearing, MTA Chief Executive Officer Franklin E. White said he 
was disappointed that the judge did not act on the agency's request to lift the 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dragging out of this matter is costing us $110,000 a day," White said. 
"Even if we win, we're going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 But Martin Hernandez, an organizer for the Labor/Community Strategy Center, 
the lead plaintiff in the case, said the transit agency has an alternative to 
fare increases and reductions in bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the millions of dollars MTA has allocated to extend the Blue Line 
to Pasadena, he said, "Let's not start building something that we don't have 
money for." 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials contend that the first fare hike in six years was not only in 
line with price increases for other goods and services but was a "reasonable 
and necessary business decision," required to close a $126-million budget 
deficit this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs' attorneys, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, 
argued in court papers that any financial harm to the MTA caused from delaying 
the fare increase "pales in comparison to the human suffering" that poor and 
minority bus riders would endure under a fare increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs cited a single mother with an annual income of $9,500 who would 
pay 63% more to ride the bus if the $42 monthly bus passes are eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
 MTA lawyers argued that the consequences could be worse if the fare increase 
is further delayed.  
</P>
<P>
 "If MTA is not allowed to collect the fares . . . even if the court concludes 
that there had been no civil rights violation, the moneys that could have 
balanced the budget will be forever gone and drastic service cuts will be 
imperative," MTA attorneys say in court papers.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / 37TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; FOE'S INDICTMENT SPURS 
LIBERTARIAN; WITH DEMOCRATIC REP. WALTER TUCKER ACCUSED OF TAKING BRIBES, LONE 
CHALLENGER GUY WILSON SEES A CHANCE TO MAKE A MARK. BUT POLITICAL EXPERTS SAY 
THE INCUMBENT NEED NOT WORRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Merchant seaman Guy Wilson was hundreds of miles away at a Seattle port when 
Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) was indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes!" Wilson shouted, his fist in the air, as his crew mates looked on 
curiously. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, a 34-year-old Libertarian, is the only challenger to Tucker in the 
37th Congressional District, which includes Compton, Carson and parts of San 
Pedro and Long Beach. The district is so heavily Democratic (77%) that no 
Republican felt it worth entering the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, 37, became a bit more vulnerable last month when a federal grand jury 
indicted him on 10 counts of extortion and income tax evasion. Federal 
prosecutors accused him of accepting $30,000 in bribes during his tenure as 
Compton's mayor. He has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had not planned to spend any more than $1,000 on the campaign until the 
news of Tucker's indictment broke. Now he has opened a campaign office in Long 
Beach, selected a volunteer campaign manager and treasurer, raised $10,000 and 
plans to tape a cable television commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertarians -- who have never elected a congressman and are eager to draw 
public attention to their philosophy of abolishing most governmental regulation 
-- have zeroed in on the race, holding fund-raisers and helping Wilson 
campaign.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Wilson, an African American who grew up in South-Central Los 
Angeles, refuses to pass judgment on the charges against Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll leave that up to the jury," he said. But he dismisses the congressman's 
argument that the government's probe was racially motivated.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rubbish," Wilson said, leaning back in a chair at his headquarters on Long 
Beach Boulevard. "I am sick and tired of hearing how blacks got a raw deal in 
this country. Instead of crying about that, we've got to break free" of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the ways to do that, he says, is to follow the Libertarian motto: Stop 
relying on government to solve your problems.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson fancies himself an independent fellow, fond of mottos like "Live free 
or die!" and "Damn the rules; it's the feeling that counts." He decided to 
challenge Tucker last February when he realized that the congressman was likely 
to face no opposition. He'd gotten some political experience as a union 
representative and had quit the Democratic Party in disgust two years earlier 
to become a Libertarian. "I was fed up (with the system), but I couldn't sit 
around and complain any longer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't have enough money to pay ballot registration fees, so he went to the 
streets to gather signatures to get on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts say Tucker, even under the cloud of an indictment, will 
have an easy shot at reelection. Long before the June primary, rumors had 
surfaced that the FBI was investigating Tucker, but he easily trounced his 
Democratic opponent, San Pedro businessman Lew Prulitsky. The Tucker name is 
popular in Compton, where Tucker served as mayor and his father was a school 
board member, councilman and then mayor until his death in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is way too stacked" against Wilson, said Fernando J. Guerra, a political 
science professor at Loyola Marymount University in Westchester. "Incumbency 
has an effect, even after death or indictment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The money Wilson has raised would be a drop in the bucket to a major party but 
unusual for many Libertarian candidates, who are accustomed to waging campaigns 
out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is interested in his campaign," said Alan Carlan, a Libertarian 
running for the 54th Assembly District seat held by Betty Karnette (D-Long 
Beach). "This is a very, very unique opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson grew up with his grandparents in what he calls a lower-middle-class 
home, while his five siblings were being raised in New York with his mother. 
His father, also a merchant seaman, lived in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate says that as a teen-ager he spent a lot of time at the local 
library, as much for socializing ("to hang out with the ladies") as for 
learning. Yet his intellectual bent was clear. The first book he remembers from 
his teens was "Blacks in Economics" by Thomas Sowell, a black conservative 
economic adviser to Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 At 19, Wilson became a merchant seaman, and several years later he moved to 
San Pedro. Co-workers who have gone on monthlong voyages with him say he is 
outspoken and driven. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he believes in something, he practices it and preaches it," said Kerry 
Williams, a junior engineer with the National Maritime Union in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Wilson helped organize a strike on the Golden Gate, protesting the 
Keystone Shipping Co.'s failure to release records of benzene levels on the 
ship. The firm eventually turned over the records to the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson gave co-workers few indications that he was interested in politics. He 
was frustrated that almost half his paycheck went to taxes and he came to 
believe his own Democratic Party was only making matters worse. So in 1992, he 
switched to the Libertarian Party. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Wilson says, his first move would be to try to repeal the 16th 
Amendment, which established the income tax. He also favors government vouchers 
that would let parents send their children to either public or private schools, 
opposes gun control and the "three strikes" laws, and wants to greatly reduce 
the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to keep products off the 
market.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SCHOOL SURVEY FINDS SAFETY, RACIAL CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An informal survey by the Santa Ana Unified School District shows that the 
most commonly cited reasons for transferring intermediate and high school 
students to other districts are safety problems and racial disparity. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of a 10-question survey that was distributed this year to 400 
families whose children left the district between the intermediate and high 
school levels were released last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 86 parents and students who responded, 16.6% cited gangs and safety 
issues as reasons for leaving the district. Also, 9.9% cited ethnic disparity 
and 9.7% cited poor school image as reasons for enrolling elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Other reasons for leaving included better academic programs elsewhere, cited 
by 8.8% of the respondents, class size, cited by 8.6%, and better social 
environment, cited by 6.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District is about 87% Latino, 6% Asian and 5% 
white. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the survey shows that 57% of the students transferring out of the 
district came from the Saddleback High School area and 27.9% came from the 
Santa Ana High School area. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials suggested that the students who left might have stayed if 
local high schools' accomplishments were better publicized and if parents 
received more information about the quality of education Santa Ana schools 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need to be responsive to our image, because it affects the entire 
community, and if there are misperceptions, we need to correct them," said 
Trustee Audrey Yamagata-Noji, who requested the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 A district committee made up of parents and school officials analyzed the 
results and suggested changes to address the concerns of survey respondents. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee recommended that the district launch a public awareness campaign 
featuring student accomplishments and explore the possibility of creating a 
fundamental high school, which would combine traditional instructional programs 
with strict dress and behavior rules and strong parental involvement. JON

any other challenger in the Nov. 8 council race. Nine candidates are running 
for three seats. 
</P>
<P>

 Former President Richard Nixon wrote in his memoirs that as a child he dreamed 
of becoming a railroad engineer, inspired by the romantic sound of train 
whistles in his boyhood town. 
</P>
<P>
 But if a proposed ordinance that goes before the City Council today is 
approved, local youths may no longer hear that inspirational whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Schwing is pushing for a measure that would prohibit train 
operators from sounding whistles within city limits except in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hearing complaints about the increase in trains blowing whistles and 
disturbing people's sleep," Schwing said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Barbara Kiley, who wrote of the train whistle in a poem honoring 
Nixon, said the sound was romantic, not a nuisance. "I think it's kind of silly 
to try and stop" the whistle, she said. "It's blown for safety reasons, and 
it's a nostalgic thing. The trains were here long before the people 
(complaining) were." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

MAGIC STILL COMING TO LAGUNA, DESPITE POLITICAL FLAP; POLITICS: CONTROVERSY 
ERUPTS AFTER FLYERS LINK VISIT TO FUND-RAISER FOR COUNCIL CANDIDATE MEL OWENS, 
BUT JOHNSON WILL STILL SPEAK TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Political flap or no, Earvin (Magic) Johnson is coming to town. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson plans to speak at a Laguna Beach High School assembly today, despite 
an uproar created by flyers linking the event to a fund-raiser for City Council 
candidate Mel Owens, a former Rams linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Johnson said the former Los Angeles Lakers basketball star 
was shocked Monday when he learned of the controversy surrounding his visit, 
which he saw as focusing on local youth, not politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing Magic would want to do is disappoint the children of Laguna, 
so he will be there," Denise Villanueva said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been abuzz about the event visit since flyers began circulating 
throughout town late last week saying Johnson would give "a motivational 
anti-drug, anti-gang message" followed by a fund-raiser at a local art gallery 
for the Owens campaign and the Boys & Girls Club of Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Unified School District officials, seeking to distance the school 
from any political campaign, said Monday that when Owens presented the plan to 
have Johnson speak at the high school, he did not mention the fund-raiser 
afterward.  
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Paul M. Possemato said Owens called him at home Sunday and promised to 
cancel the fund-raiser so the assembly could proceed without involving the 
district in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens "misunderstood the rules and has canceled" the fund-raising event, 
Possemato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boys & Girls Club was also taken aback by the flyers, which named the club 
as co-sponsor of the $90-per-person fund-raiser. The club, which prides itself 
on staying out of politics, wants no part of the event or the money, former 
executive director Pat Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to distance ourselves from this as far as possible," said Barry, 
whom Owens first approached with the idea. Barry said he asked Owens to put 
something in writing, but that he never did. The club never endorsed the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got mud thrown on our name and we don't know how to scrape it off. . . . 
This community is absolutely in an uproar." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, still bristling from being drawn into a political debate, club 
leaders fired off a letter to Owens saying the organization's tax-exempt status 
could be threatened by such involvement and insisting that "our association 
with the event be immediately terminated." 
</P>
<P>
 Villanueva said Johnson is interested only in speaking to the city's youth. 
She said Owens also asked Johnson to attend what she described as an already 
arranged political fund-raiser afterward, and Johnson said he would if time 
permitted. The flyers say the fund-raiser is in Johnson's honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was approached by a fellow former athlete to come down to speak to the 
children of Laguna and (he) accepted, and that's where it was left," Villanueva 
said. "His commitment is to attend the high school and greet these children, 
and that is going to take place. Whatever the misunderstandings are, it sounds 
like they've been cleared up by the appropriate people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach HIV Committee also has jumped into the fray, complaining that 
Johnson, who is HIV-positive, doesn't plan to talk about the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no gangs in this town, even though we are threatened by outside gangs 
perhaps," member Johanna Feldera said Monday. "However, we have a very high HIV 
incidence. For Magic to come to Laguna and not speak about HIV is really 
missing an opportunity to educate our students."  
</P>
<P>
 This is Owens' second stab at a Laguna Beach City Council seat. In 1992, then 
a political newcomer, he placed third after outspending all other candidates.

SANTA ANA OKS TUNNEL TO COUNTY JAIL FROM NEW CITY UNIT; JUSTICE: SOME FEAR 
OPENING DOOR FOR COUNTY INMATES TO BE HELD IN CITY CELLS. SUPERVISORS TAKE UP 
ISSUE TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council authorized an agreement with the county Monday to build a 
tunnel linking the county jail with the planned $107 million city jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement calls for the city to pay for the tunnel, which would link the 
county Intake and Release Center with the new jail. The tunnel's main purpose, 
according to the agreement, is to save costs and prevent escapes while moving 
Santa Ana inmates to the county facility. The County Board of Supervisors will 
take up the issue today. 
</P>
<P>
 A description of the tunnel project provided to supervisors by the county 
staff lists a "potential secondary use" of "housing of prisoners to relieve 
periodic overcrowding at either the city or county facility." 
</P>
<P>
 But the possibility that the tunnel could make it easier for the county to 
house inmates in the city jail worries many Santa Ana residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's all said and done, this will be a county facility, as sure as God 
made green apples," said resident Ron Heike. "The city can't afford this thing, 
and they can't afford to let it sit empty either." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the county's responsibilities include granting the city 
access to county property to construct the tunnel and providing personnel to 
help monitor design and construction. The Sheriff's Department will work with 
the city and control the tunnel doors on the county side. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the tunnel is expected to begin late this month, said Russ 
Davis, Santa Ana's jail administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 City and county officials say that there have been no discussions about using 
the city jail to help alleviate overcrowding at the county facility, and that 
the topic was mentioned in background material for supervisors only because it 
is a possibility down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was just me informing the board that secondary uses are possible. Just 
from experience, we know that there's always the possibility of sharing 
services," said Louis Scarpino, a senior analyst with the county office of 
facilities planning.  
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the city has had "no discussions with the county at all about 
leasing jail beds." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 900-foot tunnel, the project includes a 236,000-square-foot 
police administration building, a four-story jail for 420 inmates with a 
kitchen and laundry facility, and a parking garage. The $107-million bond is 
the biggest issue ever sold by the city for a single project, city officials 
said.

TRIAL OF 4TH MAN IN SPEARING DEATH OF 17-YEAR-OLD BEGINS; COURTS: PROSECUTOR 
CALLS IT A CASE OF GROUP RESPONSIBILITY, WHILE DEFENSE SAYS IT'S ABOUT 'GUILT 
BY ASSOCIATION.'

<P>
 As the trial began Monday for one of six young men charged with fatally 
spearing a San Clemente High School student in the head, a prosecutor told 
jurors the case would focus on group responsibility, while the defense said the 
case was about unfairly holding one person accountable for the acts of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Alcocer, 20, of San Clemente, looked on quietly during opening statements 
in Orange County Superior Court, where he and five others have been charged 
with killing 17-year-old Steve Woods last October during a gang attack at a San 
Clemente beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer told jurors the evidence will prove Alcocer is 
guilty of murder, based on the legal theory that all who participated in the 
deadly assault are responsible for the outcome, regardless of their individual 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about a group attack, this is about group responsibility," Paer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Gene E. Dorney told jurors he does not believe there is 
evidence to prove his client launched the fatal object, a paint-roller rod, and 
said he believes the evidence will prove Alcocer is not guilty of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about how responsible a person . . . is for the deeds of other 
people," Dorney said. "It's about guilt by association." 
</P>
<P>
 Three reputed gang members or associates have already been convicted in the 
Oct. 15, 1993, attack and await sentencing. Two others await trial. The killing 
took place as Woods and his friends were pelted with blocks of wood, bottles, 
rocks and paint-roller rods as they tried to leave Calafia Beach County Park. 
</P>
<P>
 During an earlier trial, two of the defendants claimed they attacked the 
teen-agers in self-defense because they believed they were about to be attacked 
themselves. But a judge rejected that argument and said the defendants 
instigated the tragedy.

WILSON HAILS EFFORTS OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS; POLITICS: IN A SPEECH BEFORE ASIAN

 Gov. Pete Wilson on Monday praised legal immigrants for their entrepreneurial 
spirit but continued to hammer away at illegal immigrants for costing the state 
billions of dollars in public services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Saigon is an indication of the vitality and diversity that legal 
immigrants bring to California," Wilson told a gathering of Asian American 
business leaders at a restaurant here. "We're fortunate for the kind of people 
who came here and enriched our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Repeating a campaign theme, Wilson said that providing services to illegal 
immigrants "is an insult to those who followed the arduous process" of becoming 
legal residents and U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wrong to train a blind eye to the problem of illegal immigration," 
Wilson said. "It's a violation of U.S. laws that simply can not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's call for changes in immigration law and tougher laws against crime 
drew repeated applause and chants of "four more years" from the crowd of about 
150 Asian American leaders and Wilson supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The event launched "Team Wilson '94," a coalition in the Asian-American 
community dedicated to Wilson's reelection campaign against Democratic 
challenger Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition includes representatives of Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, 
Korean, Filipino, Indian, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai, Afghan, Pakistani and Hmong 
organizations. Its members include lawyers, bankers, doctors, accountants and 
other professionals and some Buddhist monks. 
</P>
<P>
 John D. Tsu, the coalition's state chairman, said that Wilson has made it 
possible for more Asian Americans to receive public services by signing into 
law legislation that ensures a more accurate census count. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, signed in September, provides separate counts for residents of 
Filipino, Chinese, Korean and Japanese descent instead of lumping them all 
together under the category of Asians or Pacific Islanders, Tsu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inder Singh, chairman of the National Federation of Indian-American 
Associations, said he supports cracking down on illegal immigrants because they 
"downgrade the status of legal immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every immigrant becomes a suspect," Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also used the occasion to scold organizers of a rally Sunday that drew 
about 70,000 participants in Los Angeles against Proposition 187, the measure 
on the Nov. 8 ballot that would deny illegal immigrants and their children 
public education, non-emergency medical care and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who supports Proposition 187, said that opponents of the measure are 
trying to confuse people by using the "false threat that everyone becomes an 
INS agent." 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the measure would require teachers to report students and their 
parents suspected of being illegal immigrants. Doctors, nurses and the police 
would also be required to report suspected illegal immigrants, opponents say. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure has widespread support, according to recent surveys, but 
opponents say the measure is mean-spirited, violates federal law and could cost 
California taxpayers billions of dollars.

CENTRAL LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when my love affair with Los Angeles had begun to wane, I made the effort 
to visit the Central Library and celebrate its first anniversary since its 
reconstruction and addition.What a joy to behold humanity, in all of its 
guises, collecting around a central and very important part of our city. 
</P>
<P>
 The canopy in the Bradley Wing bursts forth with color and design, sending an 
energy to all who pass through. The magnificent rotunda with its fabulous mural 
is truly dazzling. The juxtaposition of the old and new is sublime. 
</P>
<P>
 You have renewed my love for you, Los Angeles, by providing me with the 
perfect jewel, the Central Library. Thank you.

MONTANA BEATS BEST OF ELWAY; PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER BRONCO QUARTERBACK PUTS TEAM 
AHEAD, CHIEF STAR WINS GAME, 31-28, WITH A TOUCHDOWN PASS WITH EIGHT SECONDS 
LEFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a classic game between classic quarterbacks, it all came down to the final 
two minutes. And after John Elway produced one of his trademark drives, Joe 
Montana answered it. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana threw his third touchdown pass of the game, a five-yarder to Willie 
Davis with eight seconds left Monday night, giving the Kansas City Chiefs a 
31-28 victory over the Denver Broncos before 75,151. 
</P>
<P>
 First, it was Elway, leading Denver on a 39-yard, six-play drive. It ended 
when he ran four yards for a touchdown on a draw play, putting Denver ahead, 
28-24, with 1:29 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The scoring run came one play after his apparent touchdown pass to Cedric 
Tillman was nullified. The officials ruled Tillman stepped out of bounds while 
running his pattern. Elway then scored despite the Broncos having only 10 men 
on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montana, who missed significant practice time last week because of sore 
ribs and a bruised hip, moved his team 75 yards on nine plays, completing seven 
of eight passes and managing the clock perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they'd concede a certain part of the field to us, so we could throw 
underneath," Montana said. "We did that and kept moving." 
</P>
<P>
 The last four plays on the drive were completions of 11 yards to Kimble 
Anders, 12 yards to Derrick Walker, 19 yards to Tracy Greene and the 
five-yarder to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis extended his arms and caught the ball at the goal line, headed toward 
the outside and slipped inside the end zone pylon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made a great catch and made a real effort to get it in the end zone," 
Montana said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just needed one more play, and we couldn't seem to make it at the end," 
Denver coach Wade Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he thought the game was over after Elway's touchdown, Phillips said, 
"You don't ever think it's over with Joe Montana. But I didn't think they had 
enough time to score if we executed our defense properly." 
</P>
<P>
 The stunning drive ended Kansas City's 11-game losing streak at Mile High 
Stadium and also gave Montana and Chief coach Marty Schottenheimer their first 
victories there. 
</P>
<P>
 Schottenheimer earned his first victory at Mile High in eight tries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said I was going to stay in this business long enough to get a win in 
Denver," he said. "This wasn't a game of execution, it was a game of the fiber 
inside you. We stayed out there and turned it around to win. Tonight was meant 
to be the Chiefs' night." 
</P>
<P>
 Denver (1-5) lost its fourth in a row at home dating to last season and opened 
with three consecutive home losses for the first time in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana completed 34 of 54 passes for 393 yards with one interception for the 
Chiefs (4-2). Elway was 18 of 29 for 263 yards with two touchdowns and no 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first quarter, each team scored two touchdowns in the second 
period for a 14-14 halftime tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the first quarter, Denver defensive tackle Ted Washington tipped a 
Montana pass and teammate Dan Williams intercepted at the Kansas City 21. Three 
plays later, Leonard Russell ran 12 yards off the left side for a 7-0 lead with 
14:16 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Dickerson returned the ensuing kickoff 62 yards to the Denver 33, and 
although the Chiefs couldn't capitalize when Montana threw incomplete on fourth 
down, they got the ball at the Denver 45 after Denver was called for a holding 
penalty and Elway was sacked for an eight-yard loss by Neil Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Anders ran for 14 yards on third and seven, and Marcus Allen capped the drive 
with a seven-yard slant off the left side with 6:57 remaining. It was Allen's 
116th career touchdown, tying him with John Riggins for fourth place on the 
NFL's career list. It also ended a Chief touchdown drought at nine consecutive 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver countered three minutes later, however. Lin Elliott's kickoff sailed 
out of bounds, giving Denver possession at the 40. Elway hit Anthony Miller on 
a 19-yard pass, then found Miller on a 27-yard pass play for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs responded by driving 62 yards in nine plays. Anders caught a 
nine-yard pass on third and nine, and Montana passed 26 yards to Davis and 19 
yards to Walker before connecting with J.J. Birden on a six-yard scoring toss 
in the rear of the end zone with 1:12 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs took the second-half kickoff and marched 76 yards for the go-ahead 
touchdown. Montana completed six passes on the drive, including a four-yard 
touchdown pass to tackle-eligible Joe Valerio to make it 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway's second touchdown pass, a 20-yarder to tight end Jerry Evans, drew 
Denver into a 21-21 tie late in the period.

HOSTETLER: NO REGRETS AFTER SHELL DISPUTE; RAIDERS: QUARTERBACK DEFENDS HIS 
DECISION TO CHANGE PLAYS, LEADING TO HEATED SIDELINE ARGUMENT WITH COACH, WHO 
DOWNPLAYS THE INCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Sunday, Jeff Hostetler changed the plays. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, he was not about to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four hours after engaging in a heated argument over play-calling with 
Coach Art Shell on the sideline at Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium in front of 
69,380 and a national television audience, the Raider quarterback stood his 
ground on the other side of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler exhibited no remorse over the incident that overshadowed the 
Raiders' 20-17 overtime defeat and threatened to upset the always delicate 
relationship between those who call the plays and those who must execute them. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Hostetler said, he did not regret how he had handled the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 No, he had not talked it over as of Monday with Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 No, he did not know if things would be different in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a situation where I changed a couple of plays," he said. "Art didn't 
like it and he's the head coach and that's his decision." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hostetler made it plain it wasn't a decision with which he agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy occurred late in the first half. Although the Raiders were 
leading, 10-7, Hostetler was having a miserable half. He had completed only two 
of nine passes for 15 yards, and had been stopped by penalties, frustrated by 
dropped passes and pounded by a ferocious pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
 After Miami had gotten on the scoreboard on a 15-yard touchdown pass from Dan 
Marino to Keith Jackson, Hostetler, upon regaining possession of the ball, 
twice overruled Shell and offensive coordinator Tom Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice they called for a run and twice Hostetler opted instead for a pass. 
Neither was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Raiders punted, Hostetler came over to the sideline to discuss his 
actions with Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to explain the reasoning," Hostetler said, "behind changing the 
plays." 
</P>
<P>
 The first discussion ended in a civil fashion. Then, Hostetler came back to 
further explain his actions and the conversation turned from calm to explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Shell pointed to himself as if to indicate he alone would make 
the final decisions on play-calling. He then yanked off his headset and told 
backup quarterback Vince Evans he was going in to replace Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously infuriated, Hostetler carried on his argument with quarterback coach 
Mike White and, via telephone, with Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a quarterback, you have a feel for the game," Hostetler said Monday. 
"You're in the huddle with the rest of the guys. Sometimes guys want certain 
things and sometimes you feel comfortable with that. Hey, I'm the quarterback. 
I take responsibility for what I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he has a basic difference in philosophy with the coaching staff, 
Hostetler didn't give a direct answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he changed any plays after returning to play the second half Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't recall any," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Would he be more hesitant to change plays in the future? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he replied. "Things look a little different out on the field 
than they do elsewhere. It (changing plays when necessary) was something that 
was always highly recommended that I do. It's kind of up in the air right now." 
</P>
<P>
 No regrets over the matter? 
</P>
<P>
 "I regret having to sit out here and talk to you guys because of something 
like that," he told reporters. "I don't regret how I handled the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a real competitor. I want to win. I throw my body out there all the 
time. I give it everything I can to help us put points on the board and to win 
ballgames. I have yet to come off the field feeling like I could have given it 
something more. . . . I'll fight to finish. I'll continue to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 After venting his fury Sunday, Hostetler wished his teammates luck, then, 
clutching his helmet, seemed to be walking off the field. Was he really leaving 
during a game in which the Raiders fell to 2-4? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no. I was just going down to get a Coke," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammates Chester McGlockton and Eddie Anderson intercepted Hostetler at about 
the 40-yard line, calmed him and convinced him to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Raiders said they had thought Hostetler was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 If the quarterback had done so, Shell might have been forced to fine or even 
suspend his quarterback, further widening the breach between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the confrontation earlier Monday, Shell did his best to downplay 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a coach and a player having a discussion," he said. "That's all. . . . 
What happened yesterday is over. Yesterday's game is gone. We move on to the 
next one. I'm trying to win. The players are all trying to win. We don't have 
time to sit around and think about what happened. I'm moving forward. I'm sure 
he (Hostetler) is too." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for further details about his face-to-face dispute with his quarterback, 
Shell closed the subject. "I'm not going to discuss that anymore," he said. 
"That's a dead issue now. You guys are going to make it bigger than what it is. 
It's nothing big." 
</P>
<P>
 That remains to be seen. A public clash between the head coach and the 
quarterback can split a team. What is now required to heal the rift? 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning," Hostetler said, "heals everything. . . . Art is the head coach. 
He's got a lot of decisions to make. I'm all for the team. Whatever direction 
that he wants us to go, I'm going to go full steam with it. That's just how I 
am. I want this team to succeed."

EVERETT IS NEXT TARGET FOR THE RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, the Rams were 2-5 and quarterback Jim Everett had recently 
criticized the coaching staff, calling the game plan obsolete as the team 
prepared for its next game, at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett was benched, T.J. Rubley started and the final score read: San 
Francisco 40, Rams 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a year later, Everett has been shipped off to the New Orleans Saints, 
Rubley is sidelined because of injury, Chris Miller is the starting quarterback 
and the Rams are 3-4 with hopes of making the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 And who should be standing between the Rams and the .500 mark but Everett, who 
goes against his former team Sunday in New Orleans for the first time since the 
Rams traded him there for a seventh-round draft pick last March. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to make this personal at all," cornerback Todd Lyght said of 
playing against Everett. "We don't care if Archie Manning is quarterbacking or 
if it's Bobby Hebert. It doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams haven't won four games by the end of October since 1989, when they 
started 5-0, finished 11-5 and made the NFC championship game with Everett at 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are two games behind NFC West leader San Francisco, they figure 
they have legitimate playoff hopes because they have completed the toughest 
part of their schedule, having already played road games at Atlanta, Green Bay 
and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being 3-4 is always better than 2-5," Coach Chuck Knox said. "We're back in 
the hunt. There are a lot of 3-4 and 4-3 teams out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are convinced that a 4-4 record would make them at least a wild-card 
contender, based on a seemingly easy final month of the season with games 
against New Orleans, at Tampa Bay, at Chicago and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we've turned the corner but we're where we need to be," 
tailback Jerome Bettis said. "If we can go into the (bye week) break 4-4, we 
can say we've turned the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett fell out of favor with Knox and his staff last season, and the team 
traded him shortly after signing Miller to a three-year, $9-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett told some of his former teammates that he would play against the Rams 
no matter what, even if injured, and he told New Orleans writers earlier this 
season that he was "looking forward to going against Knox." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a diplomatic route, Everett refused to comment on Knox to New Orleans 
reporters on Monday, saying only that he was looking forward to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to put your best foot forward when you have a chance to play your 
friends, your ex-teammates," Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox, also taking the diplomatic route, said, "I haven't thought about it. I 
know he's a good quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett has resurrected his career somewhat in New Orleans, where he is 
completing 62.8% of his passes with nine touchdowns and seven interceptions. 
But some of his statistics have been produced in the late stages of blowouts. 
All five of the Saints' losses this season have been by double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who has started two fewer games than Everett because of injuries, has 
completed 50% of his passes with six touchdowns and six interceptions but has 
played well in the last two games, against Green Bay and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Have the Rams upgraded the quarterback position? 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think we made some improvements," Bettis said. "You never know what 
Jim could have done if he had stayed here, but you have to say, 'Do you want to 
make that move in terms of where we're headed?' Jim's a quality quarterback, 
and he has shown that down there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams got their fourth victory of last season on Dec. 12, when Rubley 
started at New Orleans. Bettis rushed for a career-high 212 yards and a 
touchdown in 28 carries during a 23-20 Ram victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be hard for me to duplicate that performance," Bettis said. 
"They're going to be waiting for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis will face a Saint defense that ranks 23rd in the league against the run 
and was beaten for three touchdowns rushing Sunday by San Diego running back 
Natrone Means. Means became the first back to rush for three touchdowns against 
the Saints in 179 games. The last to do it was the Rams' Eric Dickerson in a 
30-27 victory at Anaheim Stadium in the second game of the 1983 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram offense is scoreless in the second half of the last two games and 
relied on defense and Bettis' running to protect a 17-10 halftime lead against 
the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis carried 30 times for 88 yards Sunday, 14 times for 46 yards in the 
fourth quarter, with two more carries wiped out by penalties. The Rams had the 
ball for 11 minutes 5 seconds of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerome takes a lot of pressure off me and opens up the passing game," Miller 
said. "But in the second half, sometimes we lean on him a little too much. We 
say, 'Here you go, Jerome. Here's eight or nine dudes up there, let's see how 
many yards you can get.' Those are some hard-earned yards."

JIM MURRAY: IF RAMS GO, BETTIS MUST STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They used to give guys who did what he does nicknames. In the old days, Jerome 
Bettis would have been "Bronko" as in Nagurski, or "Tank" or "Bull" or "The Big 
Bang." A few of the Rams call him "J.B." And that's as close as he gets to a 
nom de guerre.  
</P>
<P>
 Bettis with the football leaves as much devastation in his wake as anyone who 
ever carried one, but he had a hard job getting his hands on one. That's 
because Bettis doesn't look like your basic Galloping Ghost or Fourth Horseman. 
He looks more like your basic middle linebacker. He should have a quarterback 
or flanker in his paws, not the ball. He's not big -- 5 feet 11. He's fast but 
not blinding -- 4.5 in the 40. But there's a lot of him -- 245 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually a guy with that configuration gets his hands on the ball only when he 
falls on it. Coaches used to take one look at that silhouette and conclude they 
only had to decide whether he was to be on the offensive or defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 He got all the way to college before the brain trusters figured out that if 
Bettis didn't have access to the football, someone had made a terrible mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, Notre Dame didn't figure it had another George Gipp on its hands. 
The Irish put him at fullback, which is a kind of compromise. They told him, 
"Now when you see these guys come through that line, you get between them and 
the guy with the ball -- he'll be named Reggie or Ricky or something -- and you 
knock them down, then get out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, on third and one, they would let Bettis carry the ball and tell 
him to simply fall forward. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to pinpoint when the perception changed. Veteran Notre Damers think 
it was the day they gave him the ball to make a third-and-one first down and he 
made a 60-yard touchdown while he was at it. But by 1991, they were giving 
Bettis the ball enough so that he scored 20 touchdowns with it. Now that, as it 
happens, is 12 better than Gipp in his best year and two more than any other 
Notre Dame running back ever scored in any year. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a way, Bettis did his own blocking. That is to say, he did what 
blockers do -- knock the tackler down and keep going. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlined against a blue-gray sky was a lot of horse. Bettis scored three 
touchdowns in the Cotton Bowl victory over Texas A & M. He had scored three the 
year before in the Sugar Bowl victory over Florida, one on a 49-yard run and 
one on a 39-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis says that when he went to the scouting combine tryouts the next year, 
he was outrunning all the Heisman candidates. The Rams had no qualms about 
giving him the ball. They drafted him No. 1 and with no hesitation put him at 
running back. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a throwback. To the days of Nagurski, Ernie Nevers, even Marion Motley 
and Larry Csonka. A big man with the moves of a scatback and the speed burst of 
a quarter horse. The Rams had once had a backfield of Bettises. They called it 
"the bull elephant" backfield -- Tank Younger, Dick Hoerner and Deacon Dan 
Towler -- and they used it interchangeably with a small, fast backfield of V.T. 
(Vitamin) Smith and Tommy Kalmanir. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis wasted no time becoming the new bull elephant. Also rookie of the year 
and, maybe, Ram of the decade. He rolled up 1,429 yards. Those, it so happens, 
are Jim Brown-Franco Harris statistics. He carried 39 times in one game and 
averaged slightly less than five yards a carry for the season. He caught 26 
passes. He attracted more coverage than the O.J. Simpson trial when he got the 
ball but he had six 100-yard games and one 200-yard game. He was harder to stop 
than a bride's tears. 
</P>
<P>
 In a league in which the headlines go to Barry Sanders, Marshall Faulk, Barry 
Foster, Chris Warren and Emmitt Smith, Bettis has rolled up more yards than any 
of them except Sanders. He has more than any of the half-dozen running backs 
who finished ahead of him twice in Heisman balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the big reason the Rams are the junkyard dogs of the NFL this season. 
You never know whether they are going to lick your hand or bite it. The biting 
is done by the Rams' sure Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 He stood toweling off in the locker room after the Rams' home victory over the 
New York Giants on Sunday and looked out at the congress of white lights, 
microphones, notepads, pencils and cassettes thronged about him. This spotlight 
interrogation makes some players frown. Bettis enjoys it. He grinned as he 
pulled on a pair of pre-faded jeans, a bowling shirt and a pair of shoes built 
for climbing telephone poles in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your day job fixing downed telephone lines?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis smiled. "High fashion," he said. "Going to a prom." 
</P>
<P>
 Was the Giant victory a turning point? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's a plus," he said. "We can be a good team. The people we play know 
it. We have to convince our own fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Did he know the Rams were considering trading up in the draft by skipping him 
to get Garrison Hearst (third in the Heisman voting)? 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis smiled. "Nah. The Rams got what they wanted. They got a gem -- me!" 
</P>
<P>
 Does he take a position on the proposed move of the Rams to Baltimore or St. 
Louis? 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we stay," he said. "Who wants to leave California?" 
</P>
<P>
 Who indeed? Ram fans only hope if the Rams do move, they leave Bettis here.

WINNING THE POOH; FORMER UCLA STANDOUT SAYS HE FINALLY FEELS AT HOME IN THE NBA 
WITH CLIPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guard Pooh Richardson sat behind the bench dressed in street clothes as the 
Indiana Pacers came within one game of reaching the NBA finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, who had sat out the final 13 games of the regular season after 
suffering a separated right shoulder, wasn't activated for the playoffs, 
although he had recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Larry Brown, reluctant to upset the team's chemistry by activating 
Richardson after the Pacers had won their last eight regular-season games, 
played point guards Haywoode Workman and Vern Flemming as the Pacers extended 
the New York Knicks to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard watching if you're hurt, but it's even twice as hard watching if  
</P>
<P>
 you're healthy and ready to play and you're not playing," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why didn't the Pacers activate him? 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing Coach Brown, you never know," Richardson said. "I never received a 
straight answer myself. "Honestly, I didn't really care. What I wanted to do 
was just be activated and be there if they needed me. I didn't care if they 
started me or played me 10 minutes because there was a chance that we could 
have gone to the (finals)." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said it was a case of bad timing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he got hurt, Haywoode and Vern stepped forward and played great," Brown 
said. "We never could get him healthy enough to play and our team started to 
play well. There were a lot of factors. We got more comfortable with each 
other. It wasn't so much Pooh, it was where our team was going at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read a lot of stuff about my relationship with Pooh. Hey, I didn't feel any 
problems with Pooh. 
</P>
<P>
 And I still believe he's terrific and has terrific skills, but it was just an 
unfortunate situation in terms of timing. It was just a bad time to get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, when the Pacers voted on splitting playoff money, they didn't vote 
him a full share. Forward Malik Sealy, who also sat out the playoffs even 
though he, too, was able to play, received a full share. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the money's concerned, it was no big issue," Richardson said. "My 
season was over with anyway. Whatever I received, I looked at as gravy. If 
you're not playing, there's no reason to expect anything. It was fair. I'm not 
bitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said he met with Pacer General Manager Donnie Walsh and Brown after 
the season and asked to be traded. The Pacers sent him to the Clippers, along 
with Sealy and the rights to Nebraska forward Eric Piatkowski, the 15th player 
selected in the draft, for disgruntled point guard Mark Jackson and the rights 
to Louisville guard Greg Minor, the 25th player drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had a different version. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't ask to be traded. That's a lot of baloney," Brown said. "He had to 
be traded because it wouldn't have been fair for him. He might have asked 
Donnie, but he didn't ask me. But I don't think that's the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a long-term commitment to Pooh, but we almost went to the championship 
with Haywoode and Vern and it would have been a very tough situation for him 
(this season). To me this is a trade that, hopefully, is going to help him, 
Malik and Mark." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, who maintains that he always wanted to play for the Clippers, was 
elated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that can top (the trade) was when I was drafted," Richardson 
said. "That's the only thing that can top the fact that I was sent to L.A. and 
to the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone can say what they want, but I always wanted to play for the 
Clippers. Nothing against the Lakers, but they always had everything. The 
Clippers always had a lot of talent, but I think a lot of people misjudged 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The trade has revitalized Richardson, who played at UCLA and said he would 
have preferred to remain here for his NBA career. Richardson, 6 feet 1 and 180 
pounds, reported for training camp in excellent shape after working out for 
five hours a day last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 He had hoped the Clippers would draft him in 1989 but, with their second pick, 
selected Duke's Danny Ferry instead. Richardson went to the Minnesota 
Timberwolves, where he spent three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was realistic," Richardson said. "I knew I wasn't the second pick in the 
draft, but I was hoping that some kind of trade would happen and I would be 
here. When I got to Minnesota I was going to play hard and do the best I could, 
but my heart was really back in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers considered trading for Richardson in 1992, but the deal never 
materialized and Minnesota sent Richardson and forward Sam Mitchell to Indiana 
for forward Chuck Person and guard Michael Williams before the start of the 
1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honestly, I thought I had no business being in Indiana," Richardson said. "I 
thought I was coming from Minnesota straight here. Too bad this isn't like a 
regular job where you can file for a transfer wherever you want to go, or I 
would have done it earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson clashed with former Pacer Coach Bob Hill during his first season in 
Indiana, and his scoring average fell from 16.5 to 10.4, his assist average 
from 8.4 to 7.7. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown replaced Hill last season, there were reports that Richardson and 
Brown clashed. Richardson says he got along with Brown, but disliked living in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got along well with Larry," Richardson said. "I never had problems with 
Larry. I grew up in the big city (Philadelphia) and I went to school in the big 
city (Los Angeles) and it was hard coming to a small spot like Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows Coach Brown. He wants you to get better, so he's always on 
you. You just have to be tough mentally." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got along with him," Brown said. "When I got the job, based on his ability, 
I thought he'd be a tremendous player for us. We didn't win, but it wasn't 
because of his play." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, whose scoring average has declined for the last three seasons 
after a career-high 17.1 points in 1990-91, hopes to revive his career here. 
</P>
<P>
 Plagued by injuries last season, he had career lows in scoring average, 10; 
games played, 37; shooting percentage, 45.2; rebounds, 3.0, and assists, 6.4. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be easy for me to go out and play a lot of minutes and score a lot 
of points and say that I'm proving my point," Richardson said. "But I think 
that's not fair to the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I don't like about this league is that they'll say bad things about 
someone . . . and all of a sudden it becomes the gospel. If they say bad things 
about (the Clippers), all of a sudden it travels like it's the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Although players were quick to criticize the Clippers last season because of 
contract disputes, the atmosphere has been tranquil at training camp being 
conducted by new Coach Bill Fitch at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got a bunch of guys who don't want to be here, let them go," 
Richardson said. "I'm not a general manager and I don't own this team, I'm just 
a player who's committed to playing here. But I wouldn't pay guys millions of 
dollars to run around and talk bad about the organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, the guard's fifth coach in six years, believes Richardson, 28, is at a 
crucial point in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been just about everywhere you can be," Fitch said. "He's home, so where 
do you go if you get kicked out of home? And he knows that. He's had a lot of 
stops for a young career, and playing (point guard), you have to settle down 
somewhere and run some team some time for a longer period of time."

HE KNOWS TRUE MEANING OF SUCCESS; PRO BASKETBALL: AFTER NEARLY DYING IN A CAR 
CRASH 10 MONTHS AGO, SACRAMENTO'S HURLEY IS HAPPY SIMPLY TO BE PLAYING IN THE 
NBA AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He had a bad blister on the bottom of his foot from running and cutting so 
much, and a bruise on his thigh from getting kneed going through a screen in 
practice. It was wonderful how much they hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 These were basketball injuries that bothered Bobby Hurley in Honolulu during 
the weekend as the Sacramento Kings opened the exhibition season with two games 
against the Lakers. He has been waiting 10 months to be able to limp and ache 
for the right reasons. Ten months to return to basketball at this level. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing in a summer league in New Jersey, then against better 
competition in the Rocky Mountain Revue in Salt Lake City, and now better 
competition still with the Kings in training camp and the exhibition season, 
Hurley is on the verge of completing one of the greatest comebacks in sports 
history. That has become so obvious that the only question is how far he will 
come back. 
</P>
<P>
 His injuries from a Dec. 12 car crash in Sacramento were life-threatening. He 
survived a torn trachea that resulted in eight hours of surgery -- "We can't 
tell you how unusual it was because most people end up in in the coroner's 
office," one of his doctors said -- not to mention broken ribs and bones in his 
shoulders and back and torn knee ligaments. Medical personnel were worried 
whether he would leave the hospital, not whether he would play again. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hurley, although he doesn't figure to start yet at point guard for the 
Kings, a job they planned for him to take into the next century after he set 
the NCAA assist record at Duke, will be on the roster opening night, not the 
injured list. And he might play 15 minutes or so early on as Spud Webb's 
backup. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's looking as confident, or better, as he did right up to the injury," King 
Coach Garry St. Jean said. "I think he looks better now." 
</P>
<P>
 In his play or confidence? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything," St. Jean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Nick Van Exel, Hurley's counterpart in the two opening games, "I think 
right now, coming back from an injury like that and from where he was last 
season, I think he's better. He was in control out there, he got the guys in 
the right spot and he handled the ball well." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurley says he is coming along well and that even with nagging foot and thigh 
problems, he is "pretty solid right now." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, he has more strength and stamina, going 22 minutes Friday in the 
opener. He is also getting much better at driving hard to the left, another 
encouraging sign because the shoulder injury lingered the longest and had taken 
away so much strength in the arm and hand that he had trouble controlling the 
ball in traffic as he had before, resulting in an inability to penetrate down 
that side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel comfortable going either way," said Hurley, who looked good Friday 
while scoring 21 points but was limited to eight minutes the next night because 
of the blister. "Right to left is always better for me. My right hand, 
dribbling-wise, is better and I like to go right to left more, but I'm still 
able to get back to my right hand going left to right, so I'm pretty happy with 
the way that is." 
</P>
<P>
 That and other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy to be out here and competing and having a decent game," he 
said. "It's a good feeling."

MORNING BRIEFING: CAN'T STAND THE HEAT? GET OFF GRIDIRON

<P>
 In the heavyweight matchup of the year on Sunday, Dallas Cowboy guard Nate 
Newton, listed at 350 pounds, opposed Philadelphia Eagle defensive tackle 
William Perry, listed at 335. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry is nicknamed "the Refrigerator." Newton is nicknamed "the Kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, which the Cowboys won, 24-13, Newton said: "If we rub up 
against each other the wrong way, we'll start a grease fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was the first Heisman Trophy winner to play in the Rose Bowl 
game? 
</P>
<P>
 No clone: Tom Tolbert of the Charlotte Hornets on his bleached white hair and 
a "No Fear" tattoo, which has drawn comparisons to the Spurs' Dennis Rodman: 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the last person I need to be compared to. We have nothing in common. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has about 6,000 more rebounds than I do and two championship rings. And he 
has (a romantic link to) Madonna." 
</P>
<P>
 Timing problem: Boston College ran up a 35-0 halftime lead on Temple on 
Saturday before the Owls rallied in the second half, only to lose, 45-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Temple Coach Ron Dickerson: "I learned one thing. I have to save my 
pregame talk until halftime." 
</P>
<P>
 Show time: Nevada Las Vegas football Coach Jeff Horton is marketing his team 
to keep pace with the glitz of his city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our motto is: Set the pace and make them chase. This town is built on 
excitement. People can choose between Siegfried & Roy or us. We have to 
entertain."  
</P>
<P>
 The pass-oriented Rebels have a 4-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystique myth: Wide receiver Tim Brown in an interview with Armando Salguero 
of the Miami Herald on the so-called Raider mystique: 
</P>
<P>
 "I never believed in all that stuff anyway. I came from Notre Dame, which has 
more tradition probably than any other school in America, and I never got 
caught up in that. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that tradition and Raiders' mystique stuff happened years before any of 
the players now were here."  
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1924, Red Grange scored six touchdowns, four in 
the first 12 minutes on runs of 95, 67, 56 and 44 yards, as Illinois beat 
Michigan, 39-14, at Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on this day in 1924, Notre Dame beat Army, 13-7, at the Polo Grounds in 
New York, prompting this famous story lead from Grantland Rice:  
</P>
<P>
 "Outlined against a blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again. In 
dramatic lore they are known as Famine, Pestilence, Destruction and Death. 
These are only aliases. Their real names are Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley and 
Layden." 
</P>
<P>
 Shrewd thinking: Edwin Pope in the Miami Herald: "If I were booking luncheon 
speakers, the first thing would be to make sure each had a 1:30 plane to 
catch." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Halfback Frank Sinkwich of Georgia played against UCLA on Jan. 
1, 1943. Georgia won, 9-0.

 Laker assistant coach Michael Cooper has pleaded guilty to battery against his 
wife and received a deferred sentence while he continues counseling, a clerk in 
Corrales, N.M., Municipal Court said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, who attended the University of New Mexico and has a home in suburban 
Albuquerque, was arrested July 27 and charged with assault and battery, both 
misdemeanors. Under an agreement, he pleaded to the battery charge and the 
assault charge was dismissed.

 Court clerk Margaret Lumpmouth said the plea agreement with the Corrales 
prosecutor calls for Cooper to go six months without any violent incidents and 
requires continued attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in Albuquerque

 The Lakers didn't get Sedale Threatt back Monday, but they did get an 
explanation for his sudden disappearance: money. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Sexton, Threatt's agent, told executive vice president Jerry West that the 
reserve guard left the team in Honolulu sometime between late Friday night, 
after the exhibition opener against Sacramento, and early Saturday morning 
because he was unhappy with his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue apparently is not salary but rather an extension that Threatt wants 
of the deal that has two more years to run at $2.4 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what he wants because we haven't talked to him," West said. 
"Jimmy Sexton said something to the extent that (Threatt) is unhappy with his 
contract, the numbers of years on his contract. I think it has something to do 
with all these signings we're seeing these young kids sign." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers responded with a hard line. Threatt will be fined an undisclosed 
amount -- the league maximum for preseason absences is $1,000 per game skipped 
and $300 per practice -- and will not get a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not doing anything, period," West said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably the highest paid backup guard in the league at this point in 
time. . . . We're certainly not going to be held hostage by him or anyone. He's 
got two years on the contract and we expect him to honor that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sexton was not available for comment. West said the agent did not ask for a 
new deal during their phone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatt, about to begin his fourth season with the team, is projected as the 
backup to Nick Van Exel at point guard. For the time being, that job now falls 
to Trevor Ruffin, the undrafted rookie from the University of Hawaii.

 The Lakers will make their first trip to The Pond of Anaheim tonight to play 
the Clippers at 7:30.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The popular vote of callers to this desk Monday went to Art Shell over Jeff 
Hostetler. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Shell supporters were pleased that he finally demonstrated some assertiveness 
on the sideline when he benched Hostetler late in the second quarter after 
their beef during the Raider-Miami game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The coach showed the quarterback who was boss. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 My feeling is that Shell should have told Hostetler to shut up, but shouldn't 
have embarrassed the most fiery competitor on the team by removing him from the 
lineup. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the switch from Hostetler to Vince Evans didn't exactly help the 
Raiders' chances of increasing their lead before halftime. . . .

 USC is tied for third in the nation in turnover ratio with a plus-1.83 per

 The trade that sent Sam Perkins to Seattle for Doug Christie and Benoit 
Benjamin on Feb. 22, 1993, will not rank among the best of Jerry West's tenure.

week when practice opened at Pauley Pavilion."This is a special group. We have

 The coach said veterans Tyus Edney, Ed O'Bannon and George Zidek will supply

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; BETTMAN HOPES MISSED CHECKS WILL MELT THE PLAYERS' 
RESOLVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has taken a rigid stance in collective 
bargaining talks to date, but watch him get even tougher now. 
</P>
<P>
 Players would have gotten their first paychecks last Saturday, and Bettman 
figures they will crumble when they miss another. He might be right. Players 
are restless enough that some have agreed to play in Europe and risk injury 
that could void their NHL contracts. Only high insurance costs and low wages 
are keeping players from flocking to the International Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 The first rumble of discontent surfaced when some players wondered why Bob 
Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., needed five days to come 
up with his last proposal, which was hardly different from his previous plan. 
The league rejected it last Tuesday and there have been no talks since. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow has been busy keeping players informed and in line. After several 
clubs opened their books to players as evidence of their economic woes, 
Goodenow told them not to believe what they saw because the books had been 
manipulated. He also went to Chicago last week for a pep rally. 
</P>
<P>
 From here on, Bettman will try to magnify players' doubts and bludgeon the 
union into submission. 
</P>
<P>
 He had promised a new deal would include retroactive compensation for the 
economic givebacks he ordered Aug. 1, but he hinted he's no longer inclined to 
restore the givebacks. Some club officials said he went too far in proposing a 
3% levy on the gate receipts of the top 16 revenue-earning clubs, so he might 
erase that from his next proposal. No deal he offers will be as good as what 
players might have gotten two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 His lone compromise will be reducing the high end of the payroll levy rate if 
players accept a salary structure covering their first three years. In his last 
proposal, the rate topped at 122%. When Bettman brings that down, he expects 
players to back down, reasoning that it's better to have salary controls than 
no salaries at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners have been grumbling less than players. Clubs that lose money can be 
patient because they lose less in a lockout than if they played. Clubs that 
make money are fretting over potential losses, but Bettman calms them with 
promises of salary restraints. Players predicted the owners would crack when 
they had to issue ticket refunds, but Bettman delayed that by using the term 
postponement instead of lockout, and avoiding cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to other major sports, hockey always used to seem quaint. Only once, 
in a 10-day strike in 1992, did players fight for the free agency and 
arbitration that baseball players have had for so long. High salaries turned 
other athletes into overgrown, self-absorbed children, but hockey players were 
unpretentious and almost naive. The play was the thing, not the pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's just another business whose owners trample tradition in their rush 
to see the often tricked-up bottom line on their financial reports. A BUNCH OF 
CHEAPSKATES 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, Brian Downey -- a 26-year-old career minor leaguer playing in the 
Colonial Hockey League -- would have been thrilled to be promoted to the NHL. 
But when the Ottawa Senators recalled him on Oct. 7, the start of the season 
had been delayed and players were not being paid. By putting him on their 
roster, the Senators avoided paying Downey's $30,000 salary. Downey isn't a 
member of the NHLPA, so he's ineligible for union benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 That's as vindictive as it gets. If Downey's salary is the difference between 
profit and loss for the Senators, they don't deserve a franchise. An NHL 
spokesman said Ottawa would be told to rescind the promotion and restore 
Downey's salary, but the meanness can't be forgotten. THAT'S NOT THE TICKET 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings claim it's common practice for fans to pay for playoff tickets 
months ahead of time. It's a practice, but it's not commonly done that far in 
advance or by a team whose playoff prospects were as doubtful as the Kings' 
were. 
</P>
<P>
 New majority owner Joe Cohen explained early billing as standard sports 
procedure when asked why the club required fans to pay 75% of the playoff 
ticket cost by February. The Kings used that money to meet their payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no allegations that the use was illegal, but court documents 
show that Bank of America -- which had lent former majority owner Bruce McNall 
$125 million -- objected to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings missed the playoffs and did not begin issuing refunds until six 
weeks after the season. Some fans haven't gotten refunds yet. The Kings did not 
pay interest for the time they held the money. 
</P>
<P>
 A random sampling of other policies: The Mighty Ducks, who were playoff 
contenders until the final weeks of the season, did not take playoff ticket 
deposits. Nor did the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Florida Panthers didn't request 
money until late March. The San Jose Sharks, the last Western Conference 
playoff qualifier, didn't request playoff payments until March 28. The New York 
Rangers waited until March 1 to send out playoff invoices. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, Edmonton Oiler fans had an option to buy playoff tickets at 
the start of the season for $4.50 above the regular ticket price, but in the 
last two years of that program, the Oilers paid interest of a point above the 
prime rate. That program was dropped this year. EXCEPTIONS TO EVERY RULING 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey authorities in Sweden and Finland say they had no intention of obeying 
an initial ruling from Rene Fasel, president of the International Ice Hockey 
Federation, that European teams can't sign NHL players. That ruling was 
reversed on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 One likely reason is that Swedish NHL players threatened not to play for their 
homeland in the next World Championships if they were barred from playing there 
during the lockout. Finnish officials planned to sue because they feared a 
public outcry if they didn't take in the Kings' Jari Kurri and Winnipeg's Teemu 
Selanne, who are regarded as national heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL can't bar players from seeking other employment, but they won't be 
covered by NHL insurance policies. The Jets cooperated with Selanne in securing 
a policy, but Kurri is on his own. The Swedish club MoDo will buy a policy for 
Peter Forsberg, who has the Nordiques' permission to play. REPAYING FANS 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks are expected to announce a ticket-refund policy today, and 
the Kings will follow, probably Wednesday. The San Jose Sharks will also 
announce their policy today. An NHL spokesman said a quirk in California law 
requires the three clubs to announce their policies before the league-wide 
target date of Nov. 1. The league has not yet canceled games, but a source said 
that will change soon. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Selig, baseball's acting commissioner, describing Bettman to the Boston 
Globe: "He reminds me of me, but that's no blessing." . . . ESPN2 will continue 
to replace NHL games with minor league games. . . . Hockey's combatants say 
they communicate enough to make a mediator unnecessary. . . . When the schedule 
is revised, expect neutral-site games to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senators tried to send 1993 top draft pick Alexandre Daigle back to his 
junior team but failed to list him among players they wanted to send down and 
recall when the season starts. The Canadian Hockey League, which governs 
Canada's major junior leagues, will rule today. If he goes, he will earn $50 a 
week. His NHL salary is more than $2 million.

NHL SIDES ARE TALKING, SORT OF; HOCKEY: MANAGEMENT, PLAYERS ARE QUICK TO GIVE 
THEIR OPINIONS, BUT STILL ARE NOT NEGOTIATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Everyone is talking in hockey's labor dispute -- but not to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Burke, NHL senior vice president, on an eight-city informational tour, 
will be in Los Angeles today for a news conference. But there has been no 
contact between the NHL and the players' union since last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Union chief Bob Goodenow, in his Toronto office, took note of Burke's rhetoric 
and had some things to say himself. They are old friends and rivals. At 
Harvard, Goodenow played against Burke in the '70s when Burke was at 
Providence, then worked with Burke as an agent and now finds himself on the 
opposite side again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's obviously putting out the party line, saying the players are 
uninformed," Goodenow said. "He's trying to put out fires, to redirect focus. 
He knows better than anyone else that it's old-fashioned management-union talk. 
The players have never been more informed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other thing is, he is trying to overcome some of the negative press in 
the small markets -- that they don't care about the small markets." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a school of thought that a new messenger -- Burke, instead of NHL 
Commissioner Gary Bettman -- might put a different spin on the league's 
message, especially in Canada, where Bettman has been sharply criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to put a fresh face on the league because they've gotten the . 
. . kicked out of them," Goodenow said. "The image is one of distortion. We 
have a lockout. When basketball starts, they'll look even worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow is aware that several teams, including the Kings, have met with small 
groups of players. Some teams are opening the books, claiming severe financial 
problems. Others are telling the players Goodenow has not been keeping them up 
to date. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of teams are doing that," he said. "It's part of their plan to divide 
and conquer. I say the players are receiving everything (they need to know). . 
. . We had more than 100 players come in Oct. 1. We met with every team and 
we're constantly having conference calls." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, unidentified management sources have been quoted as saying the 
players' union will cave in after two or three missed paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is the owners' hope," Goodenow said. "They've got to say that. 
There's no question the players want to play. They say they want to play. But 
they should know the players are prepared for a long fight." 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, Rene Fasel, president of the International Ice Hockey 
Federation, has sent a fax to federation members, backing off on an earlier 
edict instructing them not to sign NHL players. During the weekend, the Swedish 
and Finnish federations threatened to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 The IIHF also was in danger of damaging its relationship with the union 
regarding player participation in the World Championships and Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 In Helsinki, King forward Jari Kurri and Winnipeg right wing Teemu Selanne 
practiced Monday for 90 minutes with their new team, Jokerit, in the Finnish 
League. "The situation in the NHL gets to you, and playing here calms me down 
and takes the thoughts away from the problems," Kurri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, King defenseman Marty McSorley, a member of the NHLPA's negotiating 
committee, has decided not to play for Las Vegas of the International Hockey 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley's agent, Michael Barnett, said the defenseman, 31, believed he 
couldn't devote enough time to his union responsibilities and the Thunder. "He 
felt like he didn't want to be put in a position where the PA (players 
association) had an emergency meeting and he had a game and would have to say 
no to them," Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Goodenow and Bettman, there are no immediate plans to resume 
negotiations.

 Broken Ankle Sidelines Perry for Month 
</P>
<P>
 Tests conducted Monday revealed that offensive tackle Gerald Perry has a 
broken bone above his right ankle, an injury that is expected to sideline him 
for at least four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry first suffered the injury in the fourth quarter of Sunday's overtime 
loss to the Dolphins in Miami. He returned to the field, only to re-injure it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got rolled on," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 His loss puts further pressure on an offensive line already struggling to 
protect quarterback Jeff Hostetler. The Dolphins had four sacks Sunday and 
pressured Hostetler all afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-year man Greg Skrepenak will replace Perry at left tackle. Skrepenak, 
who sat out all of last season because of an ankle injury, has been gradually 
playing his way back into shape. 
</P>
<P>
 But his recovery program has been drastically accelerated by Perry's loss. 
Asked if the Raiders were contemplating any other moves, Coach Art Shell said, 
"Right now, it's going to be Skrepenak. It's a tough thing for us, but we have 
to find a way to move on until Gerald gets back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Scott Davis, who earlier this season was absent for two weeks 
because of what were described only as "personal problems," and has been 
excused several other times from practice, was gone again Monday. Davis was 
allowed to leave the team in Miami to take care of a personal matter, but is 
expected back for practice on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton, who left Sunday's game in the third 
quarter because of a deep shoulder bruise, "should be OK," according to Shell. 
"It became kind of weak and he couldn't use it so he couldn't finish the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell said he is hoping McGlockton, who also has a leg bruise and a turf toe, 
will be ready for Sunday's game against the Atlanta Falcons at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiver-kick returner Rocket Ismail left Sunday's game because of a 
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to have to monitor him for a couple of days," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Lionel Washington and safety Eddie Anderson are not expected to sit 
out. Washington has bruised ribs, Anderson a sore knee. STEVE SPRINGER

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; BROKEN HELMET LED TO GIANT TOUCHDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said the Rams had only 10 defensive players on the field on 
Giant running back Rodney Hampton's 27-yard touchdown run Sunday because a 
player was getting his helmet fixed on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent in our short-yardage defense and a player was getting his headgear 
fixed," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Todd Lyght vented frustration at coaches on the sideline after 
chasing Hampton on the play. Lyght said Monday that he was "mad about the 
miscommunication between the players and the coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 "And I was mad at myself too, because I didn't call time out," he said. "We 
had called time out the play before because we didn't have enough guys on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wondering if we should waste another timeout, which I should have. But 
I was thinking, it was third and short and maybe we can let them get a first 
down and stop them the next series." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox did not identify the missing player. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Sean Gilbert is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against 
New Orleans. Knox said doctors plan to treat inflammation in Gilbert's 
shoulders with medication and rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Wymon Henderson, who has a groin injury, is expected to sit out two 
to three weeks, Knox said. Steve Israel, still bothered by tendinitis in a 
knee, or Dexter Davis will replace Henderson in the nickel defense. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Starting quarterback Chris Miller has been pressed by backup Chris Chandler, 
who is coming off a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox was asked if Miller's strong play against the Giants -- he completed 13 
of 26 passes for 197 yards with two touchdowns and an interception -- had 
erased any doubts about his ability to maintain the starting job or run the 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had any doubts that he could play," Knox said. "That's why we brought 
him here. The question has been: 'Will he get hurt?' He got the rib cartilage, 
then the (shoulder) and then the stinger down in his finger. But you get him 
healthy, like anybody else, he can perform at his best." MIKE REILLEY

 A rookie quarterback will start Sunday for the Washington Redskins and it 
won't be Heath Shuler. 
</P>
<P>
 Redskin Coach Norv Turner said he will start Gus Frerotte, a seventh-round 
pick out of Tulsa, against the Indianapolis Colts in place of Shuler, who has a 
sprained right ankle, and ahead of veteran John Friesz. 
</P>
<P>
 Frerotte looked sharp in the exhibition season, completing 62% of his passes, 
albeit against third-string defenses. His chief role in practice has been to 
run the scout team. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 After consulting three doctors about his second concussion in six weeks, 
Chicago Bear running back Merril Hoge has retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge, 29, was signed as a free agent in March after seven years with the 
Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 He talked with Al Toon, who also retired because of recurring concussions, and 
Lynn Swann, who had also suffered concussions. Doctors, two in Chicago and one 
in Pittsburgh, told him he risked even more damage if he tried to play football 
again.

 Giant Coach Dan Reeves will stick with Dave Brown as starting quarterback when 
New York (3-3) tries to break a three-game losing streak Sunday at Giants 
Stadium against the Pittsburgh Steelers (4-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who won the job to replace Phil Simms in training camp, was 35 of 56 
for 511 yards for four touchdowns and two interceptions in leading the Giants 
to a 3-0 start. But he has gone 54 for 98 for 571 yards, two touchdowns and 
seven interceptions in the losing streak.

 New York Jet linebacker Kyle Clifton underwent arthroscopic knee surgery and 
hopes to be available for the team's next game. The Jets are off this week, 
then play at Indianapolis. Tackle Siupeli Malamala has a sprained ligament in 
his left knee and will be sidelined for up to four weeks. . . . Tests have 
confirmed that the Pittsburgh Steelers' Barry Foster, the AFC's leading rusher 
through five games, will be sidelined up to three weeks because of a sprained 
left knee. Bam Morris, who had 82 yards in Sunday's 14-10 victory over 
Cincinnati, will start Sunday against the Giants. . . . Saint linebacker DeMond 
Winston will be sidelined four to six weeks because of a knee sprain. Running 
back Mario Bates, sidelined since teammate Lorenzo Neal broke his jaw Sept. 11, 
returned to practice last week and should be ready to play Sunday against the 
Rams. The Saints placed center-guard Jeff Davidson, who had shoulder surgery, 
and guard Baron Rollins, who had knee surgery, on injured reserve.

IF BRUINS HAVE STAR, IT MUST BE SCHAGER; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: UCLA PUNTER IS 
HAVING A FINE SEASON, BUT HE CAN'T ENJOY IT WHILE TEAM LOSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It happened again in the second quarter Saturday night. Darren Schager had 
punted 39 yards to the Oregon State one-yard line, and teammates let him know 
his status right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are telling me, 'Most valuable player,' " he said. "I'm telling them, 'A 
punter isn't supposed to be the most valuable player.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The assessment is an indictment of UCLA's 2-5 season. 
</P>
<P>
 On a team that has had defensive defections to the NFL; whose best player, 
wide receiver J.J. Stokes, has missed five games because of injury; that has 
lost its best defensive back, Carl Greenwood, to injury; that has suffered 
communication problems rendering its offense sporadically impotent and 
mistake-prone; that has frittered away opportunity after scoring opportunity, 
Schager has stood out like a beacon in the harbor. He has been the lone 
constant on an inconsistent team. 
</P>
<P>
 A punter is supposed to affect a game when he can, and Schager has. But 
control is ceded to UCLA teammates, who have lost it during a five-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 It is perhaps most telling that after Schager's punt, Oregon State needed only 
three plays -- one of them a 72-yard run by Don Shanklin -- to score en route 
to a 23-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks earlier, when Schager punted out of bounds on the one against 
Tennessee in the game's closing minutes, the Bruins got the ball back on Donnie 
Edwards' interception six plays later and saved a 25-23 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, he has punted well enough to rank second in the Pacific 10 
Conference, with a 42.3-yard average on 36 kicks, and the 17 punts that have 
been run back have been returned only 54 yards. He has pinned opponents inside 
the 20-yard line 15 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State started offensive series inside its 20 five times. So did 
Washington State, three weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
 Too frequently, however, teams that have started close to their goal lines 
have not stayed there. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it has been a good senior season for a punter whose freshman year 
included his biggest collegiate embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 He had made the team as a "pooch" punter, his duty being to punt high and 
short in close quarters, making the other team start an offensive series deep 
in its territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Keyler was the regular punter, and through two games no pooches were 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went in for my first punt, and there were 105,000 people and it was on 
national television," Schager said. "I looked over the line and there were 
about 10 Michigan helmets coming at me. Me, just a few months out of Western 
Christian High, kicking with all of this, and I rushed it and kicked the ball 
straight up." 
</P>
<P>
 The mission of a punter is to kick a wind-cheating spiral that turns over, 
like a pass. Schager's punt went end over end, 20 yards, then bounced back. "A 
12-yard kick," he said. "My first college kick went 12 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 He wondered if it would be his last. He developed tendinitis in his right leg 
and was redshirted. 
</P>
<P>
 Schager had come to the Bruins as a walk-on from Western Christian in 
Rosemead, where the school's enrollment could fit in some of UCLA's lecture 
halls. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been a football player, not just a punter, one season playing 
quarterback, though he admits he kicked more spirals than he threw. 
</P>
<P>
 Summers were spent at Ben Agajanian's camp, a pipeline for UCLA kickers and 
punters. Bruin Coach Terry Donahue asked Schager to walk on in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me they could get me into school," said Schager, whose 950 on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test ordinarily would have put his fate in the hands of an 
admissions office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the Michigan game," Schager said. "I thought about it and decided 
that I had punted for UCLA, on television, in front of 105,000 people. I wasn't 
discouraged, because I had done something I never thought I would do. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if it hadn't been for football, I wouldn't have been able to go to UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Schager looked for the good in a bad situation, and the next season, after a 
give-and-take period of five games in competition with Keyler, he found himself 
the Bruin punter for good. 
</P>
<P>
 He has never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 Schager is 28 punts from a school record for opportunities, which is 232, 
although, he said, he suspects that the record won't be his because he hasn't 
kicked as often this season as in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason has been a mistake-prone offense that has turned the ball over 14 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Five consecutive Saturdays have ended in a collision of feelings. It's 
difficult for a punter to feel a part of a team. He practices alone, until it's 
time to trot onto the field, swing his leg, then trot off again, leaving the 
business of football to the offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't block, tackles only as a last resort -- Schager has made two 
tackles, both last season -- and at game's end his contribution is reduced to 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it hits me when we lose," he said. "I don't want to take the attitude 
that I did a good job, but the team lost. I am a part of it. I feel bad when we 
lose. It's frustrating, even when you play really well." 
</P>
<P>
 What comes next? With expansion, there will be 30 NFL punting jobs available 
next season, and nowhere in pro football are positions less secure. Even the 
best punters are frequently vagabonds, bouncing from one team to the next until 
they find a niche or, more frequently, run out of teams or patience. 
</P>
<P>
 Only seven punters have been drafted by NFL teams in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's having a great season," said Donahue, who is reluctant to call him 
UCLA's most valuable player, citing efforts by tackle Jonathan Ogden, center 
Mike Flanagan and running back Sharmon Shah. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are not so reluctant, and Schager hears about it on Saturdays after he 
has put another Bruin opponent deep in its own territory.

 Alcorn State Might Get Liberty Bowl Bid 
</P>
<P>
 Alcorn State is being considered for the Liberty Bowl, the game's selection 
committee chairman says. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, expecting the host team for the Dec. 31 game in Memphis to be 
the winner of the Nov. 19 East Carolina-Memphis game, is considering Alcorn for 
the opposing team, chairman Reggie Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcorn State, which features record-setting quarterback Steve McNair, is 5-2 
and tied for second in the Division 1-AA Southwestern Athletic Conference. The 
Braves have no Division I-A opponents, and the NCAA would have to grant special 
permission for them to play in a bowl game.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; STOKES PROBABLY WON'T BE READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Wayne Cook might be losing a job, Avery Anderson is gaining one, 
in part because J.J. Stokes probably won't be available to regain one, and 
Bjorn Merten appears to be kicking himself out of one. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook is suddenly in competition with sophomore Ryan Fien to start Saturday at 
Arizona, although Coach Terry Donahue said UCLA's five-game losing streak 
should not be blamed on the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's a quarterback decision," Donahue said. "We're just going 
to try and review the situation. If a change in the quarterback is called for, 
we'll make it. I don't think Wayne is responsible for the way we're playing, 
but I also don't think Wayne is playing as well as he needs to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook completed 17 of 32 passes for 270 yards and a touchdown in Saturday 
night's 23-14 loss to Oregon State, and was sacked four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson is being promoted from third-string split end to starter after 
catching three passes for 73 yards against Oregon State. Anderson will replace 
Mike Nguyen, who has begun to drop passes. 
</P>
<P>
 The nominal starter, Stokes, was expected to be ready for Arizona but will 
have a second MRI test today after a recurrence of fluid buildup in his left 
leg. Merten, an All-American last season as a freshman, kicked field goals of 
21 and 22 yards Saturday, but he also missed one of 32 yards and has made only 
four of his last 11 tries. The option is walk-on Greg Andrasick, who has never 
kicked in a college game. JIM HODGES

FIXATIONS / ORANGE COUNTY: STREET SCENES; ARTWORKS BY THE HOMELESS FIND A 
SPECIAL PLACE IN CHARLIE COLIN'S HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are probably few art exhibits where you can find a painting accompanied 
by an info card stating "Mixed Media: Lipstick, Liquid Paper and Shoe Polish."  
</P>
<P>
 This choice of materials isn't just some chic artist's affectation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's another one of the same artist's painted on the back of two L.A. Kings 
posters," said collector Charlie Colin, pointing to a larger work. "He paints 
on whatever he can, uses spray paint and shoe polish. He goes through office 
trash bins to get Wite-Out. When he uses charcoal, it's not like art stores 
have; it's charcoal briquettes." 
</P>
<P>
 This artist, Ralph Middleton, and some 25 others whose work Colin collects are 
homeless. For the past three years the 27-year-old musician and artist has been 
combing the streets of downtown Los Angeles, befriending homeless artists and 
collecting some 200 of their works. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty of those will be displayed at Triangle Square in a vacant storefront 
next to the Susan Spiritus Gallery, opening Sunday at a "Jazz Fest" held at the 
shopping center to benefit Share Our Selves (Call (714) 538-8276 for 
information; the exhibit remains there until Nov. 15.). The Costa Mesa-based 
charity provides assistance and medical care for needy people in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the artworks address the harshness of street life. Some are about the 
artist's personal predicaments. Some are dreamscapes. All manner of scavenged 
materials are used. Whatever else might be said of the paintings' efficacy as 
art, Wite-Out certainly creates some haunting eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Colin might not seem the obvious choice for someone to be championing the art 
of society's discarded. He was raised in Newport, was on the water polo team at 
Newport Harbor High, and got his higher education at Boston's Berklee School of 
Music and USC. His mile-a-minute speech is unclouded by cynicism or doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 He points out, though, that one of the homeless artists whose work he's 
collected had been a Newport High teammate in water polo and a 4.0 student who 
experienced mental problems that left him wandering the streets of Laguna for 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real shock to see him living like that, but it brought home to me 
that it could be any of us," Colin said. "Most of these people avoid giving you 
their stories, but there are some who will tell you they're out there by 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one named Jackson-Collins for instance. He makes no apologies for 
being on the street. He chose it. He was an econ major at USC, had a live-in 
relationship with a family, was doing graphic art. He decided his talent was 
being wasted, that he wasn't being true to the gifts he was given. So he left 
his job and family and decided to live on the street. That's where he gets all 
his ideas, so he figured he should be there. He says his paintings are from 
'Real Life Studios.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Right across from the L.A. County Museum (of Art) there is a billboard which 
is backed by a wall. He has a sleeping bag and mat there. It's like his 
apartment. He goes to Fairfax, paints all day, makes enough to by his supplies 
and some food. He doesn't call himself homeless. He says he's an urban camper." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Colin began seeking such artists out after roaming L.A. looking for graffiti 
art to use for an album cover project. "I had done a lot of traveling and was 
interested in this graffiti and mural art I saw wherever I went. In each 
country it seemed to address the same basic human needs and problems. It can be 
socially poignant, and the artists doing it know it might get painted over the 
next day. I started going out with a camera to record how some walls changed 
from day to day. Some of my favorite murals, I found, were done by homeless 
artists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first one he met, Middleton, lives in the abandoned Red Car station at 
L.A.'s 2nd Street and Beaudry Avenue. Though he considers him a gifted artist, 
Colin said that after visiting him some 150 times, Middleton still can't 
remember his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started calling the area where he stays the neutral zone, because there's 
this giant seven-foot wall that has been completely covered by graffiti. The 
gangs seem to have a truce there to let everybody do their art." 
</P>
<P>
 Colin pointed to a painting of Middleton's of two youths playing with guns. 
They have rounded, peanut-shaped heads and lost Liquid Paper eyes. One wears a 
look of glee while the other appears deeply befuddled by the gun in his hands.  
</P>
<P>
 Colin said: "Here's gang members with guns. It's not just a negative 
depiction. He lives with these people. They're his friends; they help take care 
of him. He has no quarrel with them; he just sees it as being too bad, this 
situation where 12-year-olds have guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went down to see Ralph one time, and I saw these kids probably no older 
than 10. . . . They were taking huge hits from this bag filled with nail polish 
and glue, just completely gone, and they were messing around with guns."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed down in his own paint-splattered clothes, Colin roamed the streets of 
downtown L.A., eventually becoming acquainted with some 50 artists, though he 
only collects the work of half of them. Some of their works have been gifts to 
him; for most he has paid between $10 and $300. He also often brings them art 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a long time to develop trust," he said. "I've had to work on some of 
these relationships for six or seven months. And I've been very delicate about 
acquiring the art and taking it from them, because when you have literally 
nothing, the few possessions you do have have a great importance. Some persons 
may have a wadded-up napkin in their shopping cart and if you were to remove 
that, they'd go ballistic, because that might be the napkin that was under the 
wine glass of the last normal meal with their daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the homeless he encountered in L.A. was David, a Fixations subject last 
year, who was long a fixture on Orange County street corners with his cryptic, 
questioning religious signs. Colin considers his "signs art," for their 
thought-provoking qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 He tries to collect several pieces from each artist. "I want to be able to 
show the artist as a complete person. Some of their works are so compelling in 
the disturbing feeling they give of homelessness, but there are also blissful, 
hopeful ones. Some are quite aggressive and angry in addressing their 
particular circumstance -- people being shot or eating out of garbage cans -- 
then sometimes they'll be in a purely artistic phase painting their dreams and 
ideas. It seems to me that much of the art by homeless people has nothing to do 
with being homeless whatsoever. It's about being alive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Colin has had a downtown studio where he let some of the artists work for a 
while and would like to organize a location where the artists could regularly 
work. Living on the street means they rarely have more than a day to work on a 
piece, Colin said, because that work might well get lost by the next day. He's 
looking into getting a nonprofit status to set up such a studio and to find 
further ways to display their art. 
</P>
<P>
 "My favorite book when I was young was 'The Family of Man,' and I'd like to 
put together something like that with this art," he said. He was able to get 
some of the pieces displayed at a reception for Comic Relief. He's never 
offered any of his collection for sale but says that if he did, most of the 
proceeds would be funneled back to the artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these people are so committed to their art," he said. "They may not 
know where their next meal is coming from, but they'll spend what little money 
they get on art supplies, or they're out scavenging things they can adapt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's inspiring to me, but also it's kind of embarrassing because some of 
these artists work with nothing and are so resourceful and prolific under the 
most trying circumstances and under complete duress. And I have to have my 
studio and materials and everything has to be just perfect for me to paint. So 
I've been really humbled by them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the artists he deals with are clearly mentally ill, but he doesn't 
feel that diminishes their validity as artists, and certainly not the 
importance of them doing art. "I'm positive about it. I think there's nothing 
better than for a mentally troubled person than to express themselves through a 
medium such as art that doesn't have boundaries, where anything is OK and you 
can draw anything you feel and it's your version of reality. Just the process 
of doing that shows they have feelings and attitudes they want to express, 
which is saying they want to be understood or improve."  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the artists validate themselves with their art. You can see they 
have pride and respect for themselves and just have trouble functioning within 
the confines of our society. It doesn't mean that renders them completely 
helpless or that they don't want to be appreciated for what they can do."

BOOK REVIEW; HIGH-ENERGY TRIP IN HIGH-TECH WORLD; ALOHA BY MARK CHRISTENSEN ; 
SIMON & SCHUSTER $21, 287 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a perverse way, Mark Christensen's dark, funny and hyper-technological new 
novel reminds us of "Witness," the movie in which Harrison Ford plays a 
big-city cop forced to hide out among Pennsylvania Amish whose technology 
hasn't changed in 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amish put the brakes on progress in the interests of "plainness" and 
holiness, but, by accident or design, they also did it at the last moment in 
Western history when a person could carry his whole culture around in his head. 
Remember the scene in which the little boy explains to Ford how his farm's 
water system works? If everything there were obliterated -- by an H-bomb, say 
-- he could rebuild it from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the rest of us. Not anymore. As human beings' collective knowledge 
expands, the fraction of it that any individual can grasp becomes smaller and 
smaller. This breeds a sense of incompetence; hence, anxiety. It can seem, to 
give the Amish their due, downright unholy. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen, a Long Beach resident whose previous works include a novel, 
"Mortal Belladaywic," and a nonfiction book on television, "The Sweeps," is the 
latest writer to exploit our ambivalence about technology, our mixture of 
exhilaration and dread. He approaches it as most other current novelists do, 
both sci-fi and mainstream. His stock in trade isn't knowledge -- for who can 
claim much of that these days? Nor is it wisdom -- for that implies truths more 
durable than technological change seems to allow. It's expertise.  
</P>
<P>
 What distinguishes "Aloha," besides its quirky narrative voice and slam-bang 
pacing, is the detail with which Christensen describes the early 21st Century, 
the gusto with which he invents grotesqueries that are plausible extensions of 
late 20th-Century trends. Violence has slipped its Cold War moorings. The only 
ideology left is business. Korea is a corporation, not a country. Casual lovers 
give each other HIV skin tests. The ozone layer has eroded so badly that nobody 
goes to the beach without 175-SPF sunscreen. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Christensen wows us with his expertise just as Frank Crawford, 
billionaire scion of a construction empire, is wowing the narrator, his younger 
brother Tod. Tod is bright but mentally ill and woozy on medication; he can 
describe the mechanics of Frank's grandiose schemes -- just like the little 
Amish boy -- while remaining as befuddled as we are about what the big guy is 
up to. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank certainly has his sinister side. As a senior Air Force officer, he 
worked out the details of a nuclear first strike on the Soviet Union -- "a 
plan," Tod says, "just too hip for the room" at the Strategic Air Command. His 
new plan, to tap an undersea volcano and create a new Hawaiian island, is 
overkill in its entrepreneurial form: 
</P>
<P>
 "A square mile of magma, money and fax machines, it will ooze from the ocean 
13 miles off the Big Island of Hawaii and, as home of 700-plus . . . banks and 
booking centers -- and as an only-a-few-holds-barred resort -- be a penultimate 
tax and regulatory haven. And, given its location right outside territorial 
waters, it won't belong to the United States but to us . . . worth $50 billion 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Tod distrusts Frank but is used to depending on him. Besides, Frank has 
expertise in so many fields that it looks a lot like wisdom. Tod (although his 
teen-age girlfriend, Roberta, tries to remind him) forgets that expertise can 
go deep only because it's so narrow, like the hole Frank's crews are drilling 
under the ocean. Neither brother is able to remember for very long that the how 
of technology can be divorced from any defensible why.  
</P>
<P>
 So Tod lets Frank send him to the former U.S.S.R., now a vast swap meet for 
rusty military hardware. Tod thinks he's buying film that telescopes can use to 
photograph the ends of the universe, but what he's really meant to smuggle back 
is an end-of-the- world item -- a surplus H-bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Aloha" opens excitingly, with a chase. The bomb is stolen, perhaps by a 
thuggish business partner. Frank blames Tod, who feels he must run for his 
life. And it ends excitingly, with another chase, as Frank, in a last-ditch 
effort to unplug the volcano, aims to use the bomb as his corkscrew. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle sags a little. Tod struggles to manage a Waikiki nightclub. He 
fitfully tries to escape his brother's domination, to find love, to evaluate 
the dangers he faces -- although one drawback of a semi-schizoid narrator is 
that nothing he says is reliable. Christensen entertains us with raunchiness, 
cynicism and social commentary, but he's mostly just piling on the expertise 
here -- and his expertise, like Frank's, is often a substitute for something 
better that we miss. Something plain.

O.C. DEMOCRATS' 'BEATBOB' DIED TRYING, BUT SPIRIT LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BeatBob Inc., a political campaign dreamed up by two Irvine media consultants 
and later embraced by Orange County Democrats to unseat the Republican 
congressman they call "Bad Bob" Dornan, died a quiet death. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in June, 1993, amid Disneyland dazzle and Hollywood hoopla, the BeatBob 
campaign was created to amass a $300,000 war chest to attract a viable 
Democratic candidate against Dornan. Its chief fund-raising tool was to be a 
videotape compilation of the fiery Garden Grove Republican's most inflammatory 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite its untimely death following the June primary -- after having 
raised only about $50,000 -- BeatBob's ghost lives on. Its spirit has been kept 
alive by an anti-Dornan book being hawked by the media consultants, Mike Kaspar 
and John Simon, and by Dornan himself, who has propped up BeatBob as a national 
threat in order to raise money for his own reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only one not benefiting from the late BeatBob campaign is Dornan's 
Democratic opponent in the Nov. 8 election, Mike Farber, who is considered by 
some of his own party members as a long shot to unseat the eight-term 
incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 In life, BeatBob did provide a brief rally for the Democrats, and proponents 
claim they succeeded in at least calling attention to Dornan's perceived 
political foibles. And despite its demise, the Democrats are not conceding the 
election to Dornan, noting that Farber isn't pulling any punches in his 
aggressive campaign for Dornan's 46th Congressional District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, Farber unleashed the first in a series of "hit" mailers 
designed to raise questions about Dornan's "moral character." 
</P>
<P>
 The BeatBob effort also worked to the benefit of Dornan. Beginning with an 
"emergency memorandum" fund-raising letter earlier this year that elevated the 
threat of BeatBob, and culminating with an Orange County fund-raiser this week 
featuring former President George Bush, Dornan has played BeatBob like a pied 
piper leading a parade of dollar signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really felt annoyed because we proceeded to make money off of it," 
Dornan says. "We have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. They only raised 
the $40,000 and then it went for expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman gloats over his success. "(Democrats) didn't see the 
expression on my face when we passed the million-dollar point" in fund-raising, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan is only partly right, says Howard Adler, the former Orange County 
Democratic Party chairman who took on the fund-raising project. He argues that 
in firing at Dornan, BeatBob made the congressman flinch -- he reacted to the 
campaign and consequently gave credibility to the Democratic effort to defeat 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dornan is very good when he has a visible enemy, and he used (BeatBob) in his 
fund-raising," Adler concedes. "Bob Dornan was a benefit to the Democratic 
Party, and BeatBob was a target for Bob Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you know what? All of this has made the effort against Dornan more 
credible than it would have been. Bob Dornan made BeatBob more credible than it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact of the matter is, Adler says, BeatBob ultimately ran out of steam 
because he was stricken with a life-threatening neurological disease that 
forced him to step aside during the crucial start-up months. Without Adler 
piloting the fund-raising end, the campaign went into a tailspin shortly after 
its takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, though, the chance to force Dornan into retirement never 
looked as good to Democrats as it did in early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan had won reelection the previous year after garnering only 50.2% of the 
vote against Robert John Banuelos, a little-known, cash-poor Democratic 
candidate. It was the third election in a row that Dornan's winning percentage 
had declined. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 election also had provided a morale boost for the chronically 
underdog Orange County Democratic Party because of a handful of prominent local 
Republicans who had dropped their support for President Bush in favor of 
Democrat Bill Clinton. Janice Johnson -- wife of then-Western Digital CEO Roger 
W. Johnson, one of the Republican defectors -- would eventually lend her name 
to the BeatBob campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Democrats had what they believed was the best fund-raising tool of all 
-- Dornan himself. 
</P>
<P>
 During his 1992 primary contest against Judith M. Ryan, a moderate Republican 
who received funding from national women's groups, Dornan had remarked that 
"every lesbian spear-chucker in America is hoping I get defeated." Dornan 
handily won the primary, but the comment caused a stir and was added to the 
collection of quotes being compiled by Kaspar and Simon. (Dornan later amended 
that statement. "I meant to say 'spear carrier,' and everyone knows that.") 
</P>
<P>
 Kaspar and Simon remember having a brainstorm a week after the November, 1992, 
election: to produce a series of 30-second, anti-Dornan television spots that 
could air in his district, even before the '94 election season was underway. 
"We thought we could beat Dornan just by using his own quotes," Simon 
remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 The duo took the idea to Adler and others who expanded the concept. They came 
up with a gimmick to sell "shares" and issue stock certificates for BeatBob 
Inc. -- their enterprise to raise $300,000 through the sale of an eight-minute 
videotape highlighting Dornan's antics. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, key Democrats hoped that the money would entice a strong Democratic 
candidate to run against Dornan in 1994 -- such as Assemblyman Tom Umberg 
(D-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations were high in June, 1993, when the BeatBob campaign was unveiled 
at Disneyland. Tony Rodham, the brother of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
and television stars David Clennon (of "thirtysomething"' fame) and former 
"Charlie's Angel" Shelley Hack all spoke of their determination to retire 
Dornan from public office. A copy of the videotape landed on the desk of 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 But within weeks of the kickoff, Adler became ill, leaving the fund-raising 
effort without a leader. And Umberg decided to run for state attorney general 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Last February, Kaspar reintroduced the videotape at the county Democratic 
Party convention, and BeatBob "trading cards" were distributed at the state 
party meeting in Los Angeles. But the campaign was listless. 
</P>
<P>
 As he recovered from his illness, Adler says, he turned his attention away 
from BeatBob and toward Farber's campaign, which was running into rough waters 
before the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid that if Farber did not win the primary, everything we had set up 
(with BeatBob) would be lost with another weak campaign," Adler says. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the primary was over and Farber was the Democratic nominee, BeatBob Inc. 
was relegated to the political graveyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler says that the meager funds remaining in the BeatBob account were used by 
the local Democratic Party for a voter registration drive in central Orange 
County. It is in that area where Democrats hope to be competitive in four 
legislative districts -- including Dornan's -- in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan maintains that BeatBob Inc. failed because it violated the basic 
economic law of "supply and demand" -- the Democrats tried to sell BeatBob 
stock where there was no demand to get rid of him, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In politics, you live by your record, and my record is clean, and they are 
getting an ulcer getting a handle on me," Dornan boasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler says Dornan is wrong: Democrats did not have trouble raising money off 
Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a lightning rod. . . . I think it got off to a roaring success," Adler 
says. "Due to my health, and ultimately the (Farber) campaign catching up, it 
kind of drifted away." 
</P>
<P>
 Farber never fully embraced the BeatBob concept and never considered 
continuing it after he won the June primary, although he concedes "it was a 
good idea. It was a way to raise money in the district to register voters, 
that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaspar and Simon, meanwhile, have become "Dornanologists," appearing recently 
on CNBC's "Posner/Donahue Show" and radio talk shows to sell their book, "Shut 
Up Fag!" which made use of the many hours of research they had not been able to 
include in the videotape and trading cards. The title was taken from a comment 
made by Dornan's wife, Sallie. 
</P>
<P>
 Their own campaign is against Dornan, but they don't mention the Farber 
candidacy or BeatBob. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (in Orange County) have gotten used to Dornan and have accepted him, but 
as he goes around the country, people will not accept him," Kaspar says in 
defense of their book. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon echoes the sentiment. "No matter what happens after Nov. 8, the book is 
still going to be around."

PARENTS, ALUMNI DEFEND ACCUSED O.C. PRINCIPAL 
</P>

 Friends and parents of former students flocked to the defense of Msgr. Michael 
Harris on Monday, a day after news reports that the popular former high school 
principal faced allegations that he had sexually molested at least two of his 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling with their emotions, his many admirers reached for the right words, 
or the right anecdote, to describe Harris, who was the charismatic principal of 
Santa Ana's Mater Dei High School from 1978 to 1986. He then became the 
founding principal at Santa Margarita High School, which he ran from 1987 until 
he was asked to step down in January of this year pending the outcome of an 
investigation into allegations of sexual improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were standing on a football field and asked everyone who had been 
affected positively by this man to come and join us, we would fill the field, I 
know we would," said Mission Viejo Councilwoman Sharon Cody, whose son, Scott, 
attends Santa Margarita High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know him through Scott, who used to see him daily, and who will consider 
him a friend for the rest of his life. He is an extraordinary human being, with 
the amazing gift to reach children," Cody said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Winkelmann, a political consultant from Corona del Mar and parent of a 
Santa Margarita High School graduate and student, said: "This man is truly 
something incredible. I think the world of him. . . . To think that some 
second-hand accusations can ruin his career bothers me tremendously about the 
state of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Sue McKeehan of Monarch Beach graduated from Mater Dei with Harris and is the 
mother of three children who studied under him at both schools. "This man has 
had a positive effect on thousands of people, not just the students," McKeehan 
said. "He goes out of his way for so many people. I just can't say enough about 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Through his attorney, Harris, 47, has "flatly and completely denied" the 
allegations contained in a lawsuit first filed last month in Orange County 
Superior Court by former Mater Dei student David A. Price, 29, who claims that 
Harris abused him during school hours by summoning him from his classes to the 
principal's office with special hall passes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lawsuit, amended and refiled last week, was only the latest in a 
series of allegations that have rocked the communities that revolve about Mater 
Dei and Santa Margarita high schools, two large but closeknit Catholic schools 
that serve sprawling segments of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The first accusations of abuse, made by the mother of a student, came last 
December. Then, in January, Harris surprised students, their parents and the 
faculty at Santa Margarita by announcing he needed a break from the stress of 
the job and taking an indefinite leave of absence. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in March, officials of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange publicly 
disclosed for the first time that Harris had been accused of "sexual 
improprieties." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last Friday, the diocese also acknowledged that Harris had been asked to 
take a leave of absence in January while it investigated the allegations and 
that his right to "function as a priest" had been revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 To his many friends in the county, it was impossible to believe all this was 
happening to the same "Father Harris" that they had grown to love -- not only 
as a teacher, but also like a family member. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so bizarre, the whole thing," said Dina Yankoff of San Juan 
Capistrano, the mother of two boys who both played quarterback at Santa 
Margarita. Harris was known to go on the team's bus to every football game, 
home and away, and would invite the entire team to his home for pizza, ice 
cream and movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been a wonderful friend to our family and especially our boys," 
Yankoff said. "What was wonderful for us as parents was that kids can't always 
and don't always want to talk to their parents about things, and here was 
another person with whom we encouraged them to seek counsel, Godly counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 "It just kills me to see this happen," Yankoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Stevenson, 58, a printing broker from Lake Forest, has had five children 
attend the two schools under Harris, two at Mater Dei and three at Santa 
Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "My phone has been ringing off the hook since yesterday morning," Stevenson 
said. "If he says he didn't do it, as far as our family is concerned he didn't 
do it. My wife and I and kids are in his corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' friends say he is living in South County at the home of a friend, 
doing "about as well as you can do through this," and working on a doctorate at 
Pepperdine University that he expects to earn by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his friends have been critical of what they see as the diocese's lack 
of support for the man who had done so much for the Catholic community, and who 
nearly singlehandedly raised the $26 million needed to build Santa Margarita 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for the Orange County diocese were unavailable to comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Burr McKeehan, 51, a foot surgeon from Monarch Beach, called Harris "the 
most honorable person I have ever met. He has touched more lives of young 
people and helped more young people than anybody I have ever known in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the bishop has not supported him and I am disappointed at the 
diocese," said McKeehan, a Catholic who had Harris as a dinner guest with his 
family about 10 days ago. "I have not talked to anyone who does not give him 
total support." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Keane, 47, the father of three Santa Margarita students, said he worked 
with Harris on the football booster program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be honest with you. We thought he could be the Pope, that's how good he 
is. . . . It's not fair to destroy someone who is this good."

SUIT ALLEGES SEXUAL ABUSE BY O.C. PRIESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two former Orange County priests currently facing allegations of sexually 
abusing young boys have also been named in a suit filed in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Archambo, who now lives in Illinois, contends in his civil suit that 
he was molested over a five-year period by Father Richard T. Coughlin, former 
head of the Costa Mesa-based All-American Boys Chorus, and Father Gary Pacheco, 
a priest at Sts. Simon and Jude Church in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second suit filed against Coughlin and the internationally known 
chorus he started in 1970. Another former member of the chorus, Patrick 
O'Neill, filed suit in April, 1993, alleging that Coughlin fondled him and 
committed other sexual acts from 1976 to 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, at least four priests who are working or have worked in the Roman 
Catholic Diocese of Orange are currently the target of lawsuits and claims 
alleging they committed sexual improprieties with minors. At least eight Orange 
County priests or brothers have been charged or sued in regard to similar 
allegations since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stigma of suing a priest and suing the church is being washed away by the 
exposure," said Mark Roseman, the Santa Ana attorney representing Archambo and 
O'Neill. "(The victims) are starting to see the perpetrators as mortal. They're 
starting to see past the cloak and the collar." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Coughlin and Pacheco have denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin, 69, was suspended by the Diocese of Orange in January, 1993, when 
allegations surfaced that he molested five youths over a period 10 to 30 years 
ago. Coughlin was subsequently ordered to sever all ties with the chorus and 
stripped of his ability to function as a priest. 
</P>
<P>
 Archambo, now 26, alleges in his January suit that while he was a member of 
the chorus from 1978 to 1983, Coughlin fondled him during long bus trips and, 
on one occasion, in the shower. It wasn't until last year that Archambo linked 
the alleged childhood sexual abuse to psychological problems he was having as 
an adult, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin has denied the allegations by the five chorus members. He could not 
be reached for comment on Archambo's suit. The Diocese of Orange, which is also 
named in the suit, did not return phone calls Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacheco, a Franciscan who has since left the order, also is targeted in a suit 
filed last month by David A. Price, who is also suing Msgr. Michael Harris, the 
popular ex-principal of Santa Margarita High School, alleging sexual 
molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Price and Archambo allege that Pacheco molested them in Archambo's 
bedroom at his Huntington Beach home in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 John Nelson, Pacheco's attorney, said he has not yet been served with Price's 
suit, but that Pacheco has denied Archambo's "outrageous and speculative" 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Franciscan Friars of California, who are also named in both Archambo's and 
Price's suits, declined to comment. But Father John Hardin, assistant to the 
head of the West Coast province, said Pacheco has been "dispensed from his vows 
as both a Franciscan and a priest." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardin said he believed Pacheco left the order about seven years ago after 
serving in the order for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Archambo alleges in his suit that Pacheco was a friend of his family and 
frequently ate dinner at the family's home or popped in unannounced for visits. 
During these visits, Pacheco would come to Archambo's room and force the boy to 
put his hand down the priest's pants, the suit claims. 
</P>
<P>
 In sworn depositions, Archambo contends that Pacheco took him on trips to Las 
Vegas and Disneyland and he was "gratified by the attention" the priest gave 
him and feared it would stop if he told. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you understand the Catholic system, a priest is more than a man," Archambo 
said in his deposition. "I was confused." 
</P>
<P>
 Price, now 29, also alleges that Pacheco molested him at the Archambo home. 
Price said the priest molested him while he was staying with the Archambo 
family shortly after his stepmother died in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Price contends that Pacheco would come to Stephen Archambo's room at bedtime 
and would proceed to sexually molest Price in the dark. Pacheco also molested 
Price in the rectory of Sts. Simon and Jude Church, the suit says.

MORE THAN A GAME; FOOTBALL: RYAN PHELPS STARTED AT QUARTERBACK FOR IRVINE 
FRIDAY. HIS FATHER, LYLE, PROBABLY WON'T LIVE TO SEE HIS SON PLAY NEXT SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lyle Phelps made a phone call a week ago to deliver a simple message to Irvine 
football Coach Terry Henigan. They talked about Phelps' son, Ryan, a junior 
quarterback for the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
 The two go back many years. Phelps has been watching Irvine football for 20 
years -- his son, Mike, broke all the school passing records last year and 
earned a scholarship to Oregon -- and Henigan has been coach the last 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cancer doesn't look good," Phelps told the coach. "The reason I'm calling 
you is I want you to keep an arm around my boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Phelps' colon cancer is terminal. He knows there aren't many Friday 
nights left for him. Henigan knows it too, so he called the family back 
Wednesday and asked if Lyle could make one more game. He was told no, that he 
was too weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk it over," Henigan said. "I'm going to start Ryan. If you can get Lyle 
down here to watch him play, he can hear his son's name announced as the 
starter." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what he did. The first drive, damn the consequences, belonged to 
Ryan Phelps. 
</P>
<P>
 "It meant the world to me," Ryan said. "I knew he wouldn't be able to see me 
play next year. I was kind of hurt by that. But when Coach pulled me over and 
told me I was going to play the first series, I was so grateful. It was one of 
he biggest favors anyone has done for me in my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 It was no small favor. Irvine had lost three straight games and was playing 
unbeaten Newport Harbor in its first Sea View League game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ryan is our quarterback next season, I imagine," Henigan said. "(Lyle Phelps) 
may never get a chance to hear his son's name announced as a starter or see him 
quarterback a game, and I wanted him to be able to see his son play. I called 
the family to see if they could get him there." 
</P>
<P>
 That was no small task, either. Lyle Phelps, exhausted from signing some final 
paperwork earlier in the day, kept telling his wife, Carol, "I don't think I 
can make it." 
</P>
<P>
 "But we kept pushing him," Carol said, "because we knew it would be such a 
wonderful night for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle watched the game from inside a van parked on the track in the end zone. 
The Phelpses have lived in the same Irvine house for 23 years. Ryan is the last 
of four children who have gone to Irvine High School. There were many 
well-wishers poking their heads inside the van before kickoff -- parents, 
friends, former players. 
</P>
<P>
 As the drummers walked past the van, leading the football players onto the 
field, Lyle Phelps told his wife, "Boy, it's good to be home." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine won the coin flip. Even though the Vaqueros always choose to kick off, 
they instead chose to receive, and Ryan Phelps debuted as a varsity starter on 
his 34-yard line. He handed the ball to Russ Diehl five times and moved to the 
Newport 43. Sean Clark rushed for six yards, and Diehl for seven. On first down 
from the 30, Phelps dropped back and lofted a sweet pass to the right sideline 
that landed in the hands of Danny Noisy for a 16-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I got the feeling out there that the kids knew I was sick," Lyle 
Phelps said. "I can't help but believe they stepped it a notch." 
</P>
<P>
 Three handoffs later, the drive stalled at the 12 after a five-yard penalty. 
Jamie Bertolli missed a 29-yard field goal. It would be the difference in the 
game, a 9-7 victory for Newport Harbor, stopping Irvine's 17-game league 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Bertolli's kick missed to the right, the van drove away with Lyle 
Phelps inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irvine coaches don't do favors for anybody," Lyle said. "Irvine football is 
Irvine football. It was a total shock to me. When they announced his name and 
he led the squad on, it was one of biggest thrills a dad could have, and (Ryan) 
proved he could do it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a very honored parent and proud Irvine football fan. It was the biggest 
honor a father could ever have bestowed upon him. . . . The whole Irvine 
football family showed a lot of class that night." 
</P>
<P>
 When Ryan Phelps got home at 10:30 that night, he went directly to his 
father's bed, gave him a big hug and asked, "What'd you think, Dad?" 
</P>
<P>
 And Lyle Phelps said, "I'm so proud of you, Son." 
</P>
<P>
 And then both cried.

WAY TOO MUCH TIME GIVEN TO MONTANA; PRO FOOTBALL: HE TAKES CHIEFS 75 YARDS IN 
FINAL 1:29, HIS PASS WITH EIGHT SECONDS LEFT GOOD FOR 31-28 VICTORY OVER 
DENVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Even battered and bruised, Joe Montana is still the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana threw his third touchdown pass of the game, a five-yarder to Willie 
Davis with eight seconds left, lifting the Kansas City Chiefs to a 31-28 
victory over the Denver Broncos on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The touchdown, which ended the Chiefs' 11-game losing streak in Mile High 
Stadium, capped a wild finish that saw the teams exchange fumbles with less 
than three minutes left and Denver's John Elway run four yards for a touchdown, 
putting Denver ahead, 28-24, with 1:29 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway's scoring run, on a quarterback draw out of the shotgun formation, came 
one play after his apparent scoring pass to Cedric Tillman was nullified when 
the officials ruled Tillman had gone out of bounds before making the catch. 
Elway then scored even though the Broncos had only 10 men on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montana, who was hobbled by sore ribs and a bruised hip this past week, 
completed seven of eight passes to drive the Chiefs (4-2) to the winning score. 
The last four plays on the 75-yard, nine-play drive were all completions -- 11 
yards to Kimble Anders, 12 yards to Derrick Walker, 19 yards to Tracy Greene 
and, finally, the five-yarder to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis extended his arms and caught the ball at the goal line, headed toward 
the outside and slipped inside the end zone pylon as he reached the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made a great catch and made a real effort to get it in the end zone," 
Montana said. 
</P>
<P>
 It gave Montana and Coach Marty Schottenheimer their first victories at Mile 
High Stadium. Schottenheimer, the Chiefs' coach, was 0-7 going into the game. 
Montana now has won at every stadium in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they'd concede a certain part of the field to us, so we could throw 
underneath. We did that and kept moving," Montana said of the winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana completed 34 of 54 passes for 393 yards with one interception. Elway 
was 18 of 29 for 263 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver (1-5) lost its fourth consecutive home game dating to last season and 
opened the season with three consecutive home losses for the first time in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first quarter, each team scored two touchdowns in the second 
period for a 14-14 halftime tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the first quarter, Denver defensive tackle Ted Washington tipped a 
Montana pass and teammate Dan Williams intercepted at the Kansas City 21-yard 
line. Three plays later, Leonard Russell ran 12 yards off the left side for a 
7-0 lead with 14:16 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Dickerson returned the ensuing kickoff 62 yards to the Denver 33, and 
although the Chiefs couldn't capitalize when Montana threw incomplete on fourth 
down, they got the ball at the Denver 45 after Denver was called for a holding 
penalty and Elway was sacked for an 8-yard loss by Neil Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Anders ran for 14 yards on third and seven, and Marcus Allen capped the drive 
with a seven-yard run off the left side with 6:57 remaining. It was Allen's 
116th career touchdown, tying him with John Riggins for fourth place on the 
NFL's all-time list. It also ended a Chief touchdown drought at nine quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver countered three minutes later, however. Lin Elliott's kickoff sailed 
out of bounds, giving Denver possession at the 40. Elway went to Anthony Miller 
on a 19-yard pass, then found Miller on a 27-yard play for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs then went 62 yards in nine plays. Anders caught a nine-yard pass on 
third and nine, and Montana then passed 26 yards to Davis and 19 yards to 
Walker before going to J.J. Birden on a six-yard pass to the rear of the end 
zone with 1:12 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs squandered another scoring opportunity as the half ended. Elway was 
sacked for the fourth time, pushing the Broncos back to their seven-yard line, 
and Kansas City took possession after a punt at the Denver 41 with 50 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a third down at the Denver 27 with 17 seconds left and no timeouts, 
Montana completed an eight-yard pass to Walker in the middle of the field, but 
the Chiefs couldn't get lined up for a field goal before time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs took the second-half kickoff and went 76 yards for the go-ahead 
touchdown. Montana completed six passes on the drive, including a four-yard 
scoring pass to tackle-eligible Joe Valerio that made the score 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway's second touchdown pass, a 20-yarder to tight end Jerry Evans, drew 
Denver into a 21-21 tie late in the period. Elway went to Miller for 18 yards 
to start the drive, and Glyn Milburn turned short passes into 14- and 13-yard 
gains.

NEWSWIRE: TREBELHORN (49-64) IS FIRED BY CUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Chicago Cubs got rid of their 11th manager in 12 years Monday, firing Tom 
Trebelhorn after a last-place finish in the National League Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Trebelhorn, hired last October, was the fifth manager fired since the players' 
strike Aug. 12. The Cubs were 49-64. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been speculation that General Manager Ed Lynch, hired last week, 
would promote Tony Muser, the Cubs' third base coach, to manager. While an 
executive with the San Diego Padres, Lynch interviewed Muser in 1992 for a 
triple-A managerial job. 
</P>
<P>
 Trebelhorn's firing completed a Cub shake-up. Andy MacPhail was hired last 
month as the team's president from the Minnesota Twins and Lynch was hired from 
the New York Mets. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Special mediator William J. Usery will join negotiators for the players and 
owners when baseball's labor talks resume Wednesday in Washington for the first 
time since Sept. 9. Union officials are scheduled to meet with player agents 
Thursday in New York, meaning the resumption of negotiations might not get 
serious until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, pitcher Orel Hershiser of the Dodgers was among 13 players 
filing for free agency, bringing the total to 22. Fred Claire, Dodger vice 
president, said he has not had contract talks with either Hershiser or third 
baseman Tim Wallach, who filed Saturday, but expected to meet with both during 
the 15-day period when free agents can sign only with their own clubs. Claire 
said the Dodgers are still evaluating how Hershiser and Wallach fit into the 
club's future, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other players -- Tom Gordon of Kansas City, Gregg Olson of Atlanta, Chris 
Gwynn of the Dodgers and Greg Harris of Colorado -- filed for free agency. But 
they were rejected by the owners' player-relations committee on the basis that 
they lack the required six years of major league tenure because of time lost 
during the strike. Eight players have now filed and been rejected on the 
service-time issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that we're going to have to challenge that (through the grievance 
procedure), and we'll do so shortly," union lawyer Eugene Orza said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel reliever Ken Patterson and catcher Andy Allanson cleared waivers and 
elected to become free agents. The Angels filled the two roster spots with 
pitcher Mike James and utility player Luis Raven. They also took pitcher Kyle 
Sebach off the roster and sent him outright to triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Felipe Alou, who guided the Montreal Expos to the best record in the majors 
before the strike ended the season, was a near-unanimous choice as National 
League manager of the year. . . . Left-hander Jimmy Key of the New York Yankees 
will have arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder Wednesday. Jurisprudence 
</P>
<P>
 C. David Rossen, the former head of Bruce McNall's thoroughbred operation, 
pleaded not guilty to a charge that he helped the King president get loans 
fraudulently and avoid repaying them. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea was entered even though Rossen's lawyer had previously said his 
client ultimately will plead guilty. Rossen's lawyer, Robert Corbin, apparently 
entered a not guilty plea to Chief Magistrate Judge Volney Brown Jr. because 
federal law requires that only a district judge accept guilty pleas. College

<P>
 Allen Iverson, one of the country's top freshmen basketball players, has been 
declared ineligible by Georgetown for using plane tickets issued by a shoe 
company last summer, The Washington Post reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the NCAA said it probably will reinstate the 19-year-old guard 
because he reimbursed the company for the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Post said the school informed the NCAA of the alleged infraction last week 
after it learned Iverson had used tickets supplied by Nike to travel to and 
from a basketball tournament in Indianapolis in July of 1993. Names in the News

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; BROKEN HELMET LED TO GIANT TOUCHDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said the Rams had only 10 defensive players on the field 
during Giant running back Rodney Hampton's 27-yard touchdown run Sunday because 
a player was getting his helmet fixed on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent in our short-yardage defense and a player was getting his headgear 
fixed," Knox said. "We like to have 11 out there all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Todd Lyght vented frustration at coaches on the sideline after 
chasing Hampton on the play. Lyght said Monday that he was "mad about the 
miscommunication between the players and the coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 "And I was mad at myself too, because I didn't call timeout," he said. "We had 
called timeout the play before because we didn't have enough guys on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wondering if we should waste another timeout, which I should have. But 
I was thinking, it was third and short and maybe we can let them get a first 
down and stop them the next series." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox did not specify who the player was. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Sean Gilbert (sore shoulders) is listed as questionable for this 
week's game against New Orleans. Knox said team doctors plan to treat the 
inflammation in Gilbert's shoulders with medication and rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Wymon Henderson (groin strain) is expected to miss two to three 
weeks, Knox said. Steve Israel, still bothered by tendinitis in his knee, or 
Dexter Davis will replace Henderson in the Rams' nickel defense. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Starting quarterback Chris Miller has been pressed by backup Chris Chandler, 
who's coming off a sprained ankle two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox was asked if Miller's strong play against the Giants (13 for 26 for 197 
yards with two touchdowns and one interception) erased any doubts about his 
ability to maintain the starting job or run the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had any doubts that he could play," Knox said. "That's why we brought 
him here. The question has been: 'Will he get hurt?' He got the rib cartilage, 
then the AC (shoulder) and then the stinger down in his finger. But you get him 
healthy, like anybody else, he can perform at his best." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Game balls were awarded to linebackers Shane Conlan, Joe Kelly and Roman 
Phifer and quarterback Chris Miller, tailback Jerome Bettis, center Tom 
Newberry and free safety Anthony Newman. Rookie Keith Lyle was the special 
teams player of the week. MIKE REILLEY

LONG BEACH STATE NOTEBOOK / JASON REID; PARSONS SUCCUMBS TO SHOULDER PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kip Parsons thought he would have a great senior season while leading the 49er 
water polo team back to respectability. 
</P>
<P>
 In Parsons' plan, he and the team would be in top form by now, near the front 
of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation standings and getting ready to charge 
into the NCAA playoffs. The plan, he figured, was foolproof. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, not so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 What Parsons didn't count on was that his body, which had not previously let 
him down through a standout career at Villa Park High and Long Beach, had a 
plan of its own. Parsons' plan was scrapped Sept. 21 when he underwent 
season-ending surgery on his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm kind of trapped," said Parsons, 21. "For the first time, I 
feel like a young man trapped in an old man's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked so hard this summer to have a great season this year, and then this 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons (6 feet 4, 220 pounds) began experiencing pain in his shoulder last 
season but didn't think much of it. He believed the discomfort was the normal 
minor irritation one might expect from flinging a ball around a pool for almost 
half your life. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Parsons realized by late August his problem wasn't average. X-rays 
revealed strained ligaments in his shoulder, which doctors expected would keep 
him out of the pool for about a month after the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 During surgery, though, doctors discovered that Parsons' shoulder had not 
grown correctly. A screw was inserted to correct the problem and Parsons' 
season was over before it started. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so frustrating," said Parsons, who was selected All-County by The 
Times in 1990-91 at Villa Park. "I go to games and I (visualize myself in the 
pool). 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to jump in the pool and play." 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding Parsons' disappointment is that the team has struggled -- again. 
Hit by several serious injuries in addition to Parsons', the 49ers are 4-12, 
0-5 in MPSF. Long Beach did not qualify for the NCAA playoffs the last two 
seasons and is 11-38 during that span. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons was one of the guys Coach Ken Lindgren counted on to get things back 
on track. Parsons plays the two-meter position, which is similar to a center in 
basketball, Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was selected second-team All-MPSF as a junior after scoring 55 goals. 
Parsons has scored 97 goals over the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was supposed to be a real turnaround year," Parsons said, "and we have 
all these guys wind up getting hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 No injury caused more problems than Parsons'. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real big loss," Lindgren said. "Kip is one of our top scorers, and 
we needed him in the pool." 
</P>
<P>
 But Parsons hasn't sat around feeling sorry for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 A business administration major, he is using his former practice time to 
study. What's more, he's coaching a youth water-polo team in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a total blast with it," Parsons said. "I'm learning a lot of 
things about the game I wouldn't have if I was in the pool right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be fooled, though. Parsons plans to be back in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 His therapy is difficult, but going well, Parsons said. Lindgren said Parsons 
was granted a medical redshirt season by the NCAA, so he can return next season 
to complete his eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm real focused on my therapy," Parsons said, "and I can't wait to get back 
into the pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully for Parsons, this plan will go according to plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Morale boost: Lindgren's squad fought through its problems and won two matches 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers defeated Redlands, 13-5, Tuesday and UC San Diego, 17-16, in 
overtime Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing shorthanded, it's nice to win like this," Lindgren said. "They played 
hard. They could have given up a couple of times when things weren't going real 
well."

DUCKS' CARNBACK WILL PROBABLY PLAY IN SWEDEN DURING LOCKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mighty Duck forward Patrik Carnback will play for Frolunda, his former Swedish 
professional team, "unless something dramatic happens (in the NHL lockout 
situation)," his agent said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Abbott, Carnback's Boston-based agent, hoped to have the Ducks assign 
Carnback to Frolunda, his team for six seasons before coming to North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances of that were slim, according to Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira, 
who last week said: 
</P>
<P>
 "He can do what he wants, but I'm not going to assign him there. I don't think 
there is any way to stop him. But certainly he's violating his contract. If he 
were to get hurt, we wouldn't be responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Carnback had 23 points (12 goals, 11 assists) for the Ducks last season and 
played for Sweden in the World Championships last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid is in his option year," Abbott said. "He's not in a solid position. 
The risk is obviously greater long-term if he doesn't play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think at this point there's no reason not to (play in Sweden). Call me a 
pessimist, but I believe we're not going to have an NHL season in any 
recognizable form." ROBYN NORWOOD

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: AGAIN, SWEARINGEN GETS SINKING

 Ken Swearingen has been through a difficult season before, but that doesn't 
make his team's struggles this year any easier to take. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback went 1-9 in 1989, the only losing season Swearingen, the winningest 
community college football coach in the nation, has had. 
</P>
<P>
 But his program quickly bounced back. Saddleback was 10-1 in 1991, then the 
Gauchos went 11-0 in 1992 and were selected the top team in the nation by the 
J.C. Grid-Wire. Saddleback has shared a J.C. Grid-Wire national title in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback has fallen on hard times again this season. The Gauchos are 0-4-1 
and Saturday face El Camino (5-0), the top-ranked team in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a real struggle," Swearingen said Saturday after a 35-19 loss to 
Fullerton. "We're not that bad, but we keep making little mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback started the season with a 21-20 loss to Long Beach in which the 
Gauchos went for two with less than two minutes left and failed. 
</P>
<P>
 They also lost to Cerritos, 33-19, Palomar, 27-6, and tied Southwestern, 
28-28, the next three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Swearingen, looking for some change on offense, Saturday replaced sophomore 
quarterback Aron Garcia with freshman Pat Wood. Garcia had had 11 passes 
intercepted in the first four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood was 13 of 29 for 195 yards and also rushed a team-high 47 yards against 
Fullerton and is expected to start again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got better as the game went along," Swearingen said. "He did some things 
we can build as the season goes along." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fooled ya: On plays near the goal line, referees are often timid about 
signaling touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 But just the opposite occurred in Fullerton's 35-19 victory over Saddleback on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback was at the Fullerton one-yard line late in the game when 
quarterback Wood faked a handoff to running back Joshua Payseno, then started 
around the left end on a well-executed bootleg. 
</P>
<P>
 Payseno fell into the end zone and the officials signaled touchdown and blew 
the play dead. The mistake was realized when Payseno was asked for the ball. 
Meanwhile, Wood (along with the ball) was in the far left corner of the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials met, ruled an inadvertent whistle and forced Saddleback to take 
the down over. This time, the Gauchos' Payseno took the ball on the dive up 
middle and scored with 1 minute 22 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Football rankings: El Camino (5-0) beat second-ranked Cerritos, 38-35, to 
remain the top-ranked team in the weekly Southland Poll. Rancho Santiago, a 
35-14 winner over Golden West is second. The Dons (4-1) have won four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Valley (6-0) is third, Cerritos (4-1) fourth, Long Beach (5-1) 
fifth, Bakersfield (5-1) sixth, Ventura (4-1) seventh, Palomar (3-2) eighth, 
Moorpark (3-2) ninth and Grossmont (4-1) is 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Water polo: Golden West (18-1) again has established itself as the top-ranked 
team in the state. The Rustlers, which have won the last five State water polo 
titles, swept three games in the Cuesta pool-play tournament Saturday. Golden 
West beat seventh-ranked Diablo Valley, 11-9, unranked West Valley, 15-6, and 
No. 6 Cuesta, 14-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West and second-ranked Long Beach play Oct. 28 at Long Beach Belmont 
Plaza in the final South Coast Conference game. Long Beach beat Golden West, 
10-7, this season. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Padgett, a 167-pound wrestler from Rancho Santiago and Willie Green, a 
heavyweight from Cypress, will be on the South team for the North-South all 
star wrestling match Saturday at Fresno. Padgett is the defending State 
champion. Green, from Savanna High, is 18-3, including nine pins. . . 
Cross-country teams are taking the week off before the Moorpark Invitational, 
the biggest meet of the season thus far. The Moorpark race is at 9 a.m. Oct. 
29. The race is used to determine the 14 teams from Southern California that 
take part in the State meet Nov. 19 at Woodward Park in Fresno.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; SHE MOVES FROM SOFTBALL TO VOLLEYBALL, WITH A 
STOPOVER FOR TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Denise Dumble was pleased, but not particularly surprised, when she set a 
school record with seven aces in a game during her volleyball debut at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 If a sport requires a strong, overhand throwing motion, a Dumble can do it. 
Her older sister, Dawn, 22, throws the discus and shot at UCLA. Her twin 
brother, David, 19, throws the discus and hammer for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 And last season at Bakersfield College -- her first as a track and field 
athlete -- Denise finished eighth in Southern California in the shot put. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had played softball all my life until then," she said, "but I wanted to 
concentrate on volleyball and I decided to play track, uh, you don't play 
track, you participate in track, just for something to do in the off-season." 
</P>
<P>
 Never one to take the easy route, Dumble decided to compete in the heptathlon. 
Why not learn five new events instead of only one? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite an adventure," she said. "I was pretty good at the javelin, too, 
but I had no technique. I just threw it. It was a lot of fun, though. I can't 
stand to just sit around." 
</P>
<P>
 Flinging iron spheres or spears or even herself around the volleyball court 
comes naturally for Dumble. Sitting still in the classroom does not. But 
Dumble, an English major, is working diligently to emphasize the student in 
student-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very tough adjusting to school," she said. "The classes are so much 
harder. Volleyball is a challenge but it's fun. The academic side is really a 
lot of pressure, though. A lot of pressure. Everybody in this dang school is a 
genius except me." 
</P>
<P>
 Dumble is certainly no dumbbell on the court, however. She knows how to 
maximize her all-around skills and is third on the team in kills, fourth in 
blocks, second in aces and sixth in digs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Denise is a player who thinks a lot out there," Coach Mike Puritz said, 
"sometimes maybe even a little too much. Sometimes, I'd like to see her just go 
ahead and use her strength instead of trying to be too specific. She's a very 
powerful player. She hits one of the heaviest balls on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's capable of igniting this team with her serving and blocking and 
offense, but she's had to make a bit of an adjustment to playing at this level 
and, unfortunately, dealing with this level of success." 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield lost only four matches last year. The Anteaters (5-13 and 4-7 in 
the Big West) have struggled while trying to adjust to each other under the 
fire of a schedule that includes eight matches against teams ranked among the 
top 10 in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just haven't come together as a team," Dumble said. "With so many new 
players coming in, we've been trying to learn everything and learn each other 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been letting down, losing focus and letting ourselves get caught up in 
our mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine is 3-3 in its last six matches, however, and one of those losses was to 
10th-ranked Long Beach State. The Anteaters did manage to take a game from the 
49ers, who have dropped a game to only three unranked teams since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played really good that match and that game was sort of a turning point 
for us, I think," Dumble said. "It wasn't just that we found out we could 
compete with almost anybody. We played a lot harder and I think it made us 
realize where we could be and how much better we can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all get along great, off the court, too, which I think is really 
important. And we've stuck together through the losing. We just need to learn 
to win as a team. It takes more than just skills, it takes work, desire and 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lion-hearted: Dumble's favorite "movie star" is Simba, the lead character in 
the Disney movie "The Lion King." She has Simba stuffed animals, Simba 
stickers, Simba posters, even Simba bandages. 
</P>
<P>
 She also roars before every match. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just to get everyone going," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The long shot: Shooting guard Chris Brown led the nation in three-point 
shooting last year, providing the Anteaters with almost 15 points per game on 
long-range jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who did not become eligible until mid-December last season, might have 
slipped in a few over unsuspecting defenses last season. He won't sneak up on 
anyone this season, however, so Coach Rod Baker is doing his best to make sure 
his senior sharpshooter gets a decent view of the target. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris made 4.7 three-pointers a game last year and that's something you can 
easily get dependent upon," Baker said. "Hopefully, we'll be able to find a way 
to get him some shots without people hanging all over him. And hopefully, he'll 
be able to make as many as he did last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we have been able to get guys shots in the past. We tell all our 
recruits, 'We'll get you shots. You have to make them."' 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 P.J. watch: Senior P.J. Polowski racked up nine more points this weekend -- 
scoring twice in each of two games -- to boost his season total to 40 points. 
He's the second-leading scorer in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Polowski has 66 career points at Irvine in two years and is four short of the 
school record. He has at least one goal in each of the last five games and has 
scored in 13 of the Anteaters' 14 games this season. Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The men's tennis team has been ranked No. 35 in the nation in the 
Rolex/Intercollegiate Tennis Assn. ratings. Seniors Chris Tontz and Frederik 
Bach are ranked 18th in the country in doubles. Tontz is No. 67 and Bach is No. 
96 in singles . . . The fifth-ranked Anteater sailing team finished second in 
the Stoney Burke Intersectional Regatta hosted by UC Berkeley last week. Peter 
Wells and Jonathan Posner won Division A and Andy Beeckman and Carrine Palm 
took second in Division B . . . Senior striker Rich Breza is second in the 
Western Region with nine assists . . . The golf team concluded its fall 
schedule with a third-place finish in the New Mexico State Classic. Junior 
Jesse Lanham, a transfer from Long Beach College, led the Anteaters with a 
sixth-place finish, shooting 79-78-73--230 in extremely windy conditions.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: AT LAST, JORDAN CAN CELEBRATE VICTORY AGAIN

 It had been three years since Jordan High of Los Angeles won a football game. 
Despite having a high-profile coach with a lengthy list of accomplishments, the 
Bulldogs could not seem to turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
 But the skid ended last Friday, when a fourth-quarter touchdown propelled 
Jordan to a 9-8 victory at Huntington Park in a City Section game. The victory 
stopped a 31-game losing streak, second-longest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had hoped we would have had more days like this sooner," said Willie Brown, 
a seven-time all-pro defensive back with the Oakland Raiders who took over at 
Jordan last season. "Wins are very important, and this one is going to take us 
another step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 It did not come easily. Quarterback Nate Turner scrambled in from 12 yards out 
late in the game to put Jordan ahead. But the Bulldogs were penalized on the 
ensuing kickoff for an early celebration and Huntington Park drove to the 
Bulldogs' 33-yard line before turning the ball over on downs with a minute to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody (played) together," said Termell Goss, who led Jordan in rushing 
with 155 yards. "And Coach Brown really wanted to win this game." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's longest current losing streak is 35 by Huntington Beach Ocean 
View. 
</P>
<P>

 City Section officials have gone to great lengths this football season to 
transform heated rivalries into spirited ones. Locke-Fremont and 
Dorsey-Crenshaw games were tabbed "Peace Bowls" and included team breakfasts 
the morning after the games, losing players serving the winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson and Wilmington Banning will play at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach on 
Friday night in one of the section's strongest rivalries. Administrators at the 
schools decided to do a double homecoming to promote a positive relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want kids to be able to shake hands after the game," said John Newton, 
Banning's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barbara Fiege, City Section commissioner: "We want players coming away 
from games not thinking everyone on the other team is the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy has seldom followed the football program at Los Alamitos, so an 
ugly incident this season has put added pressure on Coach John Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
 During a game against Carson on Sept. 22, an unidentified Los Alamitos player 
punched assistant coach Steve Scully, who was taken to the hospital with two 
cuts that required 16 stitches, and eight chipped teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 The player, a senior, was arrested by Long Beach Police and was expelled from 
school last week. A hearing is scheduled Nov. 22 in Long Beach juvenile court. 
Scully, in his first season at the school, returned to the team two days later 
and has not missed any games. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a perception that we run a squeaky-clean program and never have any 
problems," said Barnes, whose team has a state-leading 41-game unbeaten streak. 
"But kids are kids and people are people. I can't control everything that goes 
on and, given the state of our society, I'm surprised this kind of thing 
doesn't happen more often." 
</P>

 In two seasons as the girls' basketball coach at Lynwood, Ellis Barfield 
compiled a 62-2 record and won two league titles and a State Division I 
championship. Problems off the court, however, forced school officials to ask 
for his resignation last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Barfield, 29, vows he will fight for his job over what he claims has been an 
absence of due process. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems began last July, when Barfield, assistant coach Michelle Allen and 12 
Lynwood youth players were on their way to a basketball camp at Nevada Las 
Vegas. Allen was driving a van carrying the coaches and players when it flipped 
over several times, killing 11-year-old Tracey Myricks and injuring others. The 
accident occurred 14 miles north of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen has been charged with involuntary manslaughter, and Lynwood school 
officials are anticipating civil suits from some of the players' parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Lee, Lynwood's athletic director, said Barfield did not use good judgment 
in planning the trip to Las Vegas but refused to discuss specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about more than wins and losses," Lee said. "This is about 
responsibility and reliability and taking charge for what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said he is vigorously searching for a new coach.

 The Southern Section will hold its first council meeting of the school year 
Thursday morning in Buena Park. On the agenda are controversial action items 
that could affect this year's football playoff groupings, as well as the 
possible formation of a new Orange County Section. Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Daylon McCutcheon, a running back at La Puente Bishop Amat who is regarded as 
the state's top player, did not play in his team's 49-0 victory over Mission 
Hills Alemany Friday because of a sore ankle. He is expected to play this week 
against Bellflower St. John Bosco. . . . Coach Dick Hill won his 200th game 
last Thursday when Orange defeated El Modena, 40-19. Hill, the winningest coach 
in Orange County, improved his record to 200-90-3. He is in his first season at 
Orange. . . . The Placentia Valencia football team had to forfeit two victories 
and a tie for using a fifth-year senior. The Tigers' new record is 1-4-1.

SIX CHARGED IN SCHEME TO FALSIFY SBA LOAN PAPERS; BANKING: FORMER WESTMINSTER 
LOAN BROKER CALLED CENTER OF PLAN THAT LED TO A RASH OF DEFAULTS TOTALING 
MILLIONS.

 A Pasadena banker and a former Westminster loan broker were among six charged 
Monday in a scheme that falsified Small Business Administration loan 
applications that have led to a rash of loan defaults. 
</P>
<P>
 The banker, Michael Mahoney, 29, was charged in federal court in Los Angeles 
with accepting kickbacks of $35,477 in 1990, most of it from broker Ty Huu 
Pham, 56. Four individual borrowers were also charged. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second batch of criminal actions stemming from a three-year probe 
by the SBA and the FBI of widespread fraudulent loan applications in Southern 
California.

 Pham allegedly paid Mahoney, then a loan officer at the Bank of Industry, for 
recommending approval of about 20 SBA loan applications that Pham packaged or 
assembled. Twelve of those loans have since gone into default at a cost of 
about $2 million to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney, who for the last two years has been vice president and head of the 
SBA lending department at Citizens Bank in Pasadena, did not return calls 
Monday. But at Monday's arraignment, his attorney, James Riddet, indicated that 
his client would plead guilty today. Mahoney faces a maximum sentence of 30 
years in prison and $1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham is expected to plead guilty next month to three counts of bank fraud, 
according to Nathan Hochman, the assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles who 
brought the charges against Pham and Mahoney. Pham faces a maximum sentence of 
90 years in prison and $3 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a collusive effort on all their parts, and the government was a big 
loser here," said Steve Marica, assistant inspector general for the SBA in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA officials said they looked at 24 loans that Pham helped clients acquire, 
and 16 of those loans have failed, costing banks and the SBA -- which 
guarantees 70% to 90% of business loans -- more than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, a federal grand jury indicted six borrowers -- three of them 
in Orange County -- on charges of making false statements to obtain about $1 
million worth of SBA loans. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, investigators said five of those borrowers went to the same 
Westminster loan packager, but officials did not identify him as Pham until 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal charges were filed Monday against four additional SBA borrowers who 
allegedly obtained a total of $720,000 in fraudulent business loans with Pham's 
help. All of these loans have since failed as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The four borrowers charged Monday are Dinh Nguyen, who operated a clothing 
business in Orange County and now lives in Seattle; Thuan Phuc Nguyen, who had 
a liquor store in Lake Elsinore; and Alan Nam Nguyen and Jeannie Trinh Luong, 
an Irvine couple who had a trading firm in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Thuan Phuc Nguyen and for Alan Nguyen and Jeannie Luong 
indicated that their clients would plead guilty, according to Hochman, the 
assistant U.S. attorney. Dinh Nguyen could not be reached in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA loan program has surged in recent years -- to a record $9 billion this 
last fiscal year -- while conventional lending has dried up, but the losses 
from fraud related to loan packagers and false tax returns have hurt the 
credibility of the SBA lending program. As a result of the problems in Southern 
California, the agency this month began cross-checking on a nationwide basis 
all tax returns filed in support of SBA loan applications against records at 
the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA officials and bankers said they were dismayed by the charges filed against 
Mahoney, a young bank executive who comes from a respected banking family in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly discouraging when you put this kind of trust in a bank 
official and he does something like this," said Marica, the SBA official in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Geiselmann, president of Citizens Bank in Pasadena, where Mahoney heads 
a three-person SBA lending department, said he was shocked. "He's been 
excellent here," said Geiselmann, adding that he was unaware of the criminal 
charges. Geiselman said his bank has had no problems with SBA loan defaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Marica said problems with fraud will likely lead to regulation of the loan 
packaging industry, which has grown along with the SBA loan volume. Marica 
appeared troubled by the fact that Mahoney was still working on SBA loans, and 
he said he would bring that to the attention of agency officials. He added that 
the SBA -- which has reimbursed Bank of Industry for SBA loans that failed -- 
may now seek to recover that money. 
</P>
<P>
 With numerous loans arranged by Pham, Bank of Industry was one of the top SBA 
lenders in the region in 1990, with a total volume of more than $11 million. In 
1991, the bank was acquired by Comerica Inc., a large bank-holding company 
based in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators said Pham was at the center of the loan scheme because 
he was the middleman between Mahoney and the businesses seeking the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham was well connected in Orange County's large Vietnamese community, where 
he drummed up much of his business. Investigators said he received about 3% in 
commission on the more than $4 million in loans he packaged, which would mean 
he earned more than $120,000.

KRAFT SELLING ITS BUDGET GOURMET UNIT TO HEINZ; FROZEN FOOD: SPOKESMAN FOR 
BUYER UNSURE OF PLANS FOR ORANGE HEADQUARTERS. HE SAYS ACQUISITION WILL 
COMPLEMENT ITS WEIGHT WATCHER LINE. 
</P>

 Kraft General Foods Inc. agreed Monday to sell All American Gourmet Co. of 
Orange, maker of the popular Budget Gourmet line of frozen food, to H.J. Heinz 
Co. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 A Heinz spokesman said he was unaware of any immediate plans for All 
American's Orange County headquarters, where 89 executives and other workers 
are employed. The company has total employment of about 1,000. "They haven't 
gotten around to the organizational details," explained Heinz spokesman D. 
Edward I. Smyth. 
</P>
<P>
 The frozen foods are packaged at plants in Clearfield, Utah, and in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Smyth said that Heinz is excited about the acquisition because it complements 
its other product lines. By combining raw materials, packaging and shipping 
with Heinz's other frozen foods, the Pittsburgh-based food giant hopes to wring 
more profit from the Budget Gourmet line. 
</P>
<P>
 "This acquisition gives Heinz another major brand -- the Budget Gourmet -- to 
complement its Weight Watcher brand in the growing frozen-meals category," said 
Heinz Senior Vice President David W. Sculley. 
</P>
<P>
 The All American unit will report to Michael McGrath, president of the Weight 
Watcher Food Co. division of Heinz. Smyth said that McGrath was one of the 
founders of the Budget Gourmet brand a decade ago before coming over to Heinz. 
</P>
<P>
 The two lines are complementary, he said, because Budget Gourmet is popular in 
the West, while Weight Watcher frozen foods are strongest in the East. Budget 
Gourmet is, as the name implies, value priced while Weight Watcher meals sell 
at higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 And Budget Gourmet food sales of more than $300 million in 1993 are strong 
year-round, while Weight Watcher registers its best sales during January and 
February, when New Year's weight-loss resolutions are still fresh in the minds 
of dieters. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 50% of Weight Watcher (meals) are sold to present or former Weight 
Watcher members," Smyth said. "Budget Gourmet will be a stronger market." 
</P>
<P>
 Kraft Chairman Richard P. Mayer said in a statement that its decision to sell 
Budget Gourmet "is consistent with our recently announced program to improve on 
the strategic alignment of our food portfolio." 
</P>
<P>
 Kraft is a unit of Philip Morris, which has been attempting to streamline by 
selling non-core product lines. Philip Morris confirmed earlier this month, for 
instance, that the Kraft Food Service unit was for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 A Kraft spokeswoman, Kathy Knuth , said that the company is trying to 
concentrate on such core areas as cheese, cereal, baked goods and coffee.

BRIEFCASE: RESTAURANTS AND RETAIL; TITAN STADIUM CONCESSIONS AREA TO BE 
DEDICATED TO LATE CARL'S JR. EXECUTIVE

 The late Donald F. Karcher will be honored by Cal State Fullerton on Oct. 28 
during half-time of a high school football game at the university's Titan 
Stadium. The 7 p.m. game features Servite and Saddleback high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher, a long-time Carl's Jr. executive and brother of chain founder Carl N. 
Karcher, died of cancer in 1992. Karcher was posthumously awarded an honorary 
doctorate by the Cal State system in late 1992. And, on Oct. 28, the university 
will dedicate the Titan Stadium concessions area to Karcher, a long-time Titan 
booster. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd made several generous donations over the years for the stadium and 
student scholarships," said university spokeswoman Paula Sellick. "It's 
interesting because the university has its own Carl's Jr. franchise and Carl's 
Jr. does sell food through the stadium concessions area." 
</P>
<P>
 Why make the presentation during the high school game? 
</P>
<P>
 Servite calls Titan Field home during the football season. And, Joe Levecke, a 
Servite player, is grandson of Donald and Dolly Karcher.

PEDALING VIRTUAL REALITY BIKING; FITNESS INDUSTRY: IRVINE FIRM'S MACHINE LETS 
RIDERS ESCAPE BOREDOM WITHOUT LEAVING THE GYM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tired of facing another lap on the treadmill or another bicycle ride to 
nowhere? Got 10 minutes to go and you can't wait for this workout to end? 
</P>
<P>
 Boredom, not self-inflicted torture, is the No. 1 reason most health club 
members quit after three to six months, and the industry is constantly trying 
to come up with new gimmicks to keep the customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Tectrix Fitness Equipment, an exercise equipment maker in Irvine, thinks 
that it has an answer. Judging from the response its newest machine received at 
last week's annual Club Industry Show in Chicago, it may be right. 
</P>
<P>
 Lines of fitness experts and other potential customers at the three-day event 
jammed the 18 Tectrix VR Bikes on display, waiting to take a spin through 
hillsides, down ski jumps, along city streets and inside buildings -- all on a 
stationary bicycle in an artificial, or virtual, world. 
</P>
<P>
 Those riding the VR Bike -- a combo state-of-the-art exercise machine and the 
latest virtual reality software -- bobbed and weaved, leaned sideways and 
forward, grimaced and laughed. In short, they acted very much as they might 
have had they been actually riding a bicycle outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite an exciting piece of equipment," said Mike McNeese, general 
manager of the Sporting Club at Lakeshore Towers in Irvine. "It was easily the 
top one or two most popular pieces at the trade show." 
</P>
<P>
 The recumbent bike, created with software maker CyberGear Inc. in Cambridge, 
Mass., is the first exercise machine to combine the equipment with complete 
virtual reality software and a synchronized sound system. No other manufacturer 
has anything resembling it, said fitness experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as close to reality as possible without leaving the club," McNeese said. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine has a 20-inch color monitor hooked up to it less than a yard away 
from the face of the rider, who can become quickly engrossed in directing the 
action on the screen. The rider can pedal through 440 acres of rural landscape 
and city streets in a make-believe New England setting, cycling on roads or 
grassy slopes while avoiding trees and other obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups of as many as eight bikers can be connected to travel together casually 
or to compete against one another in races, watching as each rider comes onto 
the screens of fellow riders and feeling the bumps of the road and the nudges 
of other riders. Riders also can compete against robobikers -- similar to 
playing chess against a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine's seat adjusts so cyclists can shift their weight to turn left or 
right. Thumb controls allow cyclists to shift gears, stop, view the surrounding 
area or get a map of their virtual world. A cool breeze from fans enclosed in 
the fronts of the bikes blows in riders' faces and stereo speakers provide soft 
music and sounds of wind and passing trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedaling resistance increases when going up steep terrain. Riders can coast 
downhill and unexpectedly find themselves on a ski slope that sends them high 
into the air and down through trees onto the hillside. If a biker hits a tree, 
the collision can be heard on the speakers and felt in the pedals at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, riders don't have to worry about injuries, except for pulled muscles, 
perhaps. While the bike halts when it hits a tree, it never falls. 
</P>
<P>
 It can take three hours or more to see almost everything in the virtual 
reality program, and then riders will have missed surprises hidden in pathways 
and hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeese said he'll order a VR Bike for his club and is prepared to buy two or 
three more. He said that any club that pays $7,495 for one -- about $1,500 more 
than the industry's most expensive treadmill -- should budget enough money to 
buy a few more because members will be waiting in long lines in front of the 
lone VR Bike and demanding more. 
</P>
<P>
 At such a high price, the bike was not designed for retail sale, though 
Tectrix and other exercise machine makers have been more active recently in 
selling equipment to consumers. The long secret project was always aimed for 
health clubs, said Steven Russell, Tectrix's executive vice president for sales 
and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "But consumer demand for the product (from the show) was so strong that we'll 
have to ration some of them for retail," Russell said. "We're nearly sold out 
of our production capacity for the rest of this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Shipping started this week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The VR Bike is expected to spur the company's sales next year beyond the 50% 
growth rate that it achieved this year, Russell said. The privately held 
company, which makes the ClimbMax brand of stair climber and the BikeMax 
exercise cycle, should have sales of $30 million this year, he said. It sold 
$20 million worth of exercise equipment last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tectrix, founded in 1988, said it is now the second-largest manufacturer of 
stair climbers for commercial use in health clubs, controlling 20% of that 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 This month the company placed 17th on Inc. magazine's list of the 500 
fastest-growing privately held companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just created a new category of fitness equipment, and there's nobody in it 
but us," Russell said. He figured it might take at least a year before another 
company can match the VR Bike, and, by then, he promised, Tectrix will be 
working on a new generation of virtual reality machines and adding to its 
current stock. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, CyberGear, which uses CD-ROM to display the New England 
countryside, will be coming out with another read-only disc for the VR Bike, 
this one of a Caribbean island. Russell said cyclists will be able to go up a 
volcano and into the crater, and when they ride into the water, the bike 
becomes a pedal-powered submarine that can chase fish and weave through 
underwater caves. 
</P>
<P>
 Tectrix and CyberGear also are working on a virtual reality stair climber that 
they hope to start producing late next year, he said, and one more product, 
which he declined to identify, is on the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
 "People perceive that exercise is boring, but we've turned that premise upside 
down," Russell said. "We've made it honest-to-God fun. Instead of checking 
their watches to see that they still have 10 minutes to go, they get off the VR 
Bikes after 30 minutes and wonder where the time has gone."

CLASS ACTION SUIT TARGETS ABBEY ACQUISITION 
</P>

 Abbey Healthcare Group Inc. in Costa Mesa said Monday that a federal class 
action complaint had against the corporation, Chairman Timothy M. Aitken, 
former Abbey executive Victor M.G. Chaltiel, 10 other individuals and several 
investment companies, including Prudential Ventures Partners II, Sequoia 
Capital IV and the Sequoia Capital Growth Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in the Central District of 
California by Barbara Nowack, a registered shareholder of 100 shares, alleges 
violations of the securities laws during the course of Abbey's acquisition of 
Total Pharmaceutical Care Inc. beginning in November, 1993, and seeks 
compensatory damages including interest, costs and other relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey and Chaltiel, who operated Total Pharmaceutical before the merger, have 
been suing each other for the last several months ago in connection with that 
transaction.

AST RESEARCH TO ROLL OUT NEW COMPUTER LINE; TECHNOLOGY: THE CONSUMER-ORIENTED 
MULTIMEDIA PCS ARE COMPETITIVELY PRICED BUT LATE TO THE MARKETPLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 AST Research Inc. plans to roll out its new line of consumer-oriented 
computers today, according to company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The three new models are all multimedia PCs equipped with the latest computer 
gadgetry, including CD-ROM drives, fax modems and comprehensive communications 
centers that include voice mail and call forwarding. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the initial response from retailers has been warm to its new 
Advantage line, priced competitively from $1,399 to $2,599, but analysts warn 
that the announcement should not be taken as a sign that all is well with the 
computer manufacturer, which announced Friday that it is closing its factory in 
Fountain Valley, reducing its work force by 10% worldwide and expecting a 
quarterly loss of about $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based AST is late coming to market with these Advantage models and has 
already been outpaced by competitors Compaq, IBM and Packard Bell, which 
earlier introduced similar machines. The company has also been plagued by a 
host of shareholder lawsuits and rumors of an investigation by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that they are behind the competition should not be underplayed, said 
Stephen Dube, an analyst with Wasserstein Perella Securities in New York. "They 
will not recover until they can get a great line out and get it out before 
everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a particularly crucial time for AST, added Gerald Fleming, an analyst 
with Sutro & Co., an investment bank in San Francisco. To break even in the 
next quarter, AST must have strong sales and cannot afford to continue 
suffering any of the manufacturing problems that would put them further behind 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they screw up again they are in deep trouble," said Fleming. "You can 
announce that there are new products going out but you have to be able to sell 
them and AST is losing space on retailers shelves because of what has 
happened."

 Low- and No-Fat Snacks: Newport Beach-based Pacific Snax Corp., which markets 
gourmet snacks, on Monday said that it had created a joint venture with Cuetara 
Industries, a Spanish company, that will market new lines of low- and no-fat 
snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The new venture, Balance Foods, will be jointly owned by Pacific Snax and 
Cuetara, a food manufacturer in Madrid, Spain, that has annual international 
revenue of more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuetara, which owns a 25% stake in Pacific Snax, also manufacturers snacks for 
Pacific Snax in a plant that it owns in Huntington Beach. Richard Damion, 
Pacific Snax chairman and chief executive officer, said the joint venture will 
enable Pacific Snax to manufacture the proprietary products used in the 
company's extensive lines of low- and no-fat salty snacks currently being sold 
nationwide.  
</P>
<P>
 "We expect this venture to enable Pacific Snax to exceed its revenue goal of 
$25 million to $30 million in calender year 1995," Damon said. The company 
hopes to report 1994 revenue of about $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Early next year, Pacific Snax will consolidate its production in Las Vegas. 
Pacific Snax recently acquired a 55% interest in a snack manufacturing company 
based in Las Vegas. Pacific Snax' corporate headquarters will remain in Newport 
Beach.

O.C. HOME SALES JUMP NEARLY 13% IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sales of new and existing homes in Orange County jumped nearly 13% in the 
third quarter as compared to the same quarter last year, according to TRW Redi 
Property Data. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 9,558 homes were sold in the county during the past three months, 
an increase from the 8,474 homes sold during the third quarter of 1993, the 
Riverside-based property data firm found.The average price for an Orange County 
home was up 2.1%, to $249,603 from $244,565. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, home sales in Orange County during the third quarter are down 6.3% from 
the April-June quarter this year, when 10,205 homes were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a seasonal business. I don't think it means the market is 
weakening," said Nima Nattagh, an analyst with TRW, who said that in the six 
counties that make up Southern California, both Orange and Los Angeles counties 
posted the healthiest sales gains. 
</P>
<P>
 New and existing homes sales in Los Angeles County were up nearly 14% for the 
quarter, though home prices barely budged. For the third quarter, an average 
sale price was $231,672 as compared to $231,328 reported for the same period 
last year, an increase of 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Los Angeles was especially hard-hit by the real estate downturn, 
Nattagh noted it was encouraging to see sales gains in both Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting that both Los Angeles and Orange counties are leading 
Southern California," he said. "It shows the depth of the recovery we're 
experiencing."

PAIN AS PART OF THE GAME; PLAYERS MUST TAKE AGONY WITH ECSTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sports are a last-second finger-tip catch in the end zone. A home run in the 
bottom of the ninth. A wedge of sprinters gasping and leaning toward the finish 
line. A downhill run on fresh-packed snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports are exhilaration, heartbreak, the maximized effort by the talented. 
</P>
<P>
 But sports are also a pain in the butt. And elbow. And knee. Not to mention 
wrist, ankle and hip. 
</P>
<P>
 Play any game long enough, no matter the conditions or your conditioning, and 
one thing is certain: You are bound to get hurt. The more physically demanding 
the sport, the greater the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 High school athletes are not immune. Look on the sidelines during any Friday 
night football game, and you're bound to see one or two players in casts or 
heavy bandages. Volleyball players wear a rainbow collage of bruises from 
diving on floors. Let a gymnast land awkwardly after a double somersault from 
the uneven bars, and . . . ouch. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a badminton shuttlecock, which can travel up to 110 m.p.h., can hurt if 
it hits in the right spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite tremendous strides in conditioning, technology, equipment, facilities 
and coaching, kids still go bump in the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think sports are less dangerous, but I don't know if anyone has 
proved that," said Dr. Craig Milhouse, medical director at Anaheim Memorial 
Sports Medicine. "There will be injuries, but I think in a lot of areas many 
are from overuse -- where people practice too much and won't stop when they 
feel pain. They don't listen to their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it seems like we're seeing more injuries, it's only because we're looking 
for more and are more knowledgeable. The way we approach things with more 
trainers and more sports-trained physicians, we can identify an injury that a 
kid doesn't get back on the field with." 
</P>
<P>
 That, along with conventional and unconventional rehabilitation methods, has 
saved the seasons of two key Orange Country athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos junior Kevin Feterik had earned the starting quarterback job, but 
broke his left (throwing) hand in the first half of the season opener against 
Kennedy. Feterik had been hurt before -- breaking a finger and an elbow as a 
child -- but never playing football, which he has played since he was 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was devastated; this was my first varsity game and first chance to prove 
myself," said Feterik, 17. "We were winning, and I wanted to finish. I thought 
I'd be out five to six weeks and my season was done. I was real down, although 
winning the game helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Disregarding an initial prognosis that would have sidelined him until league 
play began, Feterik sought the care of San Clemente therapist Benny Poda, who 
prescribed acupuncture, vitamin C, amino acids and herbs. Feterik did not get a 
hard plaster cast, opting instead for a soft plastic covering. He was back 
playing by Oct. 7 against Long Beach Millikan. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik said the injury gave him a new sense of his vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the time you hear about people getting hurt, but I never realized how 
lucky I was until that game. Now I'm not taking being healthy for granted. At 
any time you can be hurt. You still go 100%, but it made me realize you're not 
invincible." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, cross-country runner Jessica Corbin was expected to lead the Irvine 
girls' team to glory similar to last year's State Division I championship. But 
in late August, while attending a training camp, the junior began feeling pain 
in her left leg and hip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how it happened," said Corbin, 16. "My training was going so 
good -- I was running, lifting weights, dieting. Everything was perfect. I had 
run 11 miles once, and averaged four to five miles a practice." 
</P>
<P>
 When Corbin was first examined, the diagnosis was a pinched nerve in her back 
triggering the pain. Later, it was discovered she had Pirifomis syndrome, in 
which the muscle pressures the sciatic nerve. 
</P>
<P>
 But before that, Corbin was nearly done in by her treatment. A large daily 
dose of ibuprofen was first prescribed, but it began tearing up Corbin's 
stomach, causing internal bleeding. Corbin continued to run, wondering why her 
performance was slipping; soon she had more serious problems: anemia, a 
throat-and-sinus virus and viral bronchitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Feterik, Corbin was worried her season was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "What devastated me was coming down with the bronchitis," she said. "I could 
run with the hip irritation, the internal stuff, but I couldn't run with that. 
I came home from the trip to Stanford (Oct. 1), where we didn't do too well, 
and I was in tears. There were so many emotions; I wanted to run but I knew I 
couldn't. I knew my health comes before running, and it was now a health 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 After being told not to run for a week and changing medication, Corbin -- who 
finished fifth Saturday at the Orange County Championships at Irvine Regional 
Park -- said she's recovered, at least mentally. 
</P>
<P>
 "My confidence went down a lot when I got injured, but I had to look at it as 
it was only six days that I was out. And six days in perspective is not really 
a lot. I had to do some soul searching, regain my confidence in myself. That's 
the main thing; it wasn't the injury, it was the loss of confidence and hope. I 
thought, 'There goes college and everything.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin's injury was rare. Feterik's was not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think kids are getting hurt any more now than 10 to 20 years ago," 
said Joe Donohue, the physical therapist for the Corona del Mar and Fountain 
Valley high school football teams. "In my eight years as a therapist, I've seen 
the same type of injuries. Occasionally, you have one year of super athletes 
and the (number of) impacts are higher. But kids grow up the same; they may be 
10 pounds heavier than they were 10 years ago, but that kind of thing evens 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 According to area doctors and physical therapists, these are the types of 
injuries that most often occur in sports: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cross-country and track participants often sustain overuse injuries such as 
strained hamstrings, shin splints and tears in the plantar fascia (a fibrous 
band of tissue that connects heel to toe). Runners can get tendinitis in their 
knees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Football players sustain sprains, strains and broken bones, particularly in 
the legs. They are also vulnerable to stretched or torn ligaments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Basketball players suffer knee and ankle problems from jumping and twisting. 
They also tear up knees; there has been a rash of torn anterior cruciate 
ligament problems for both males and females in the high school and college 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 * Volleyball players have ankle problems, as well as shoulder problems from 
spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Swimmers, divers and water polo athletes have shoulder problems. There are 
occasional knee problems from the circular kick used in the breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
 * Baseball and softball players have shoulder and arm problems, primarily from 
overuse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Golfers can suffer back problems from the twisting of the trunk during their 
swings. Not as prevalent are wrist and elbow problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wrestlers sustain injuries similar to football players. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tennis and badminton players develop difficulties in elbows and shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 * Soccer players have all sorts of leg problems, including ankles and knees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every sport has its unique injuries," said Sean Higgs, a trainer at Fountain 
Valley High. "You'll find studies that support the use of every brace, and 
you'll find studies that say they don't do any good. One of our keystones is 
taping. It's mandatory for all football starters to be taped. But to say if it 
helps, how do you do a study on that? It seems to be working, but we have 
nothing to compare it to." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter, the margins of safety have been increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron La Ruffa, Fountain Valley baseball coach, remembers coaching in the 1960s 
as "taking your 10 swings and 20 ground balls." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now there are coaches for every phase of the game, even at high school," he 
said. "Strength and conditioning dramatically improved. A kid has a much better 
education from the coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 But the greatest progress is probably in football. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Fred Mueller, professor of physical education at the University of North 
Carolina, has studied catastrophic injuries -- those causing death and 
permanent paralysis -- among football players for more than 20 years. Because 
of refined equipment and rule changes, those kind of tragic incidents have 
dropped dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, there were 36 deaths in football, according to Mueller's research. 
Twenty-six of the victims were high school players. Add to that an average of 
25-30 accidents a year that resulted in paralysis in the late '60s. Among the 
reasons: "Teaching kids to block and tackle leading with their head into the 
chest," Mueller said. "That could cause major damage to spinal cords."

<P>
 Starting in 1976, a nationwide rule change eliminated initial contact with 
head or face while blocking and tackling. Four years later, standards for the 
manufacturing of helmets for high school players were established. Add improved 
medical techniques, and the difference borders on astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, there were only four direct deaths, of them three were high school 
players. (In 1990, there was none, the first time since 1931.) There were only 
eight paralyzing injuries to high school players. 
</P>
<P>
 "To bring in the numbers that low is pretty good," Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when you consider how sports continue to grow in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 But soccer and cross-country, two of the state's fastest growing participation 
sports among girls, have come under fire for the number of injuries they 
supposedly cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the Consumer Product Safety Commission reported 76,766 general soccer 
injuries nationwide, of which 56,418 came during organized activities. Nearly 
42% of these injuries occurred to players ages 15-24, with the most common 
being cuts, bruises, sprains and strains. The commission stated injuries tend 
to increase as players get older, from age 14 on, and girls generally sustained 
more injuries of all types than boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile girls' cross-country is receiving national scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Stephen Rice, a faculty member of the University of Washington's Division 
of Sports Medicine, conducted a 13-year study of about 60,000 high school 
athletes in 20 sports in the Seattle area. Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fall sports had higher rates of injury than spring sports. 
</P>
<P>
 * The highest-risk sports include football, wrestling, gymnastics, 
cross-country (girls and boys) and soccer (girls and boys). 
</P>
<P>
 * Girls' sports have higher rates of injury than counterpart boys' sports. 
</P>
<P>
 * And finally, girls' cross-country had the highest injury risk, according to 
the study. Out of 1,299 athletes tracked, 61.45% reported some type of injury. 
Football was next at 58.8%. In addition, girls' cross-country had a 17.3% 
injury rate per 1,000 practices and meets. Football again was second, at 12.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross-country "came out of the blue," Rice said. "We did not come (to this 
study) with the idea we'd find this. If it had been football first and 
wrestling second, no one would have been interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Rice believed the number of cross-country injuries -- most of them being shin 
splints and muscle strains -- came because girls had not always properly 
prepared during the summer before the season, then tried to do too much work in 
the fall. He also frowns at programs that have athletes running 50-70 miles a 
week in training. That, he contends, can lead to serious problems in 
still-developing skeletal structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls have another enemy -- body fat, or specifically too little of it. Those 
with low estrogen levels who continue rigorous training can have menstrual 
cycles interrupted. That can also lead to the body's inability to retain 
ingested calcium in the bones, which might lead to shin splints and stress 
fractures. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, naturally, was not warmly received by cross-country coaches, who 
feared hysterical reactions from parents concerned about the well-being of 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The study . . . can be misleading," said Randy Rossi, who coaches girls' 
cross-country at Irvine. "But there are some legitimate concerns he addresses. 
More often than not, kids try to do too much too soon. But at Irvine, we've had 
no great injury problem, though we have had our share of shin splints and 
variety of aches and pains. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as making sports safer, I think we're heading in that direction. 
There's more attention to preparation, and sports medicine keeps making leaps 
forward. I wasn't pleased with (Rice's) report, but it's important we address 
the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Hale has coached girls' cross-country for 35 years, the last 20 at El 
Toro High. She, argues the sheer increase in participation has plenty to do 
with the rise in injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started at El Toro in 1975, I had five girls on the team," Hale said. 
"Now I have 60. I'll have injuries because I attract kids who want to be in a 
sport but do not have the background of being in athletics over long time. Some 
of the girls are starting fresh at 14 years old. Therein lies a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I, as a runner, don't have a good summer program to build a base on, I 
won't be ready for the September workouts and break down. It's not the 
conditioned runner that has problems that knock her out for six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Rice knew some coaches would be angry once his study was published. "My 
response is I'm as surprised as anybody by the results," he said. "But 
obviously there is something going on that is creating the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though athletes today are better coached, better protected, better 
conditioned and, when necessary, more easily healed, it's still nearly 
impossible for them to avoid injury. Because if nothing else, kids will be 
kids.

JUST WHAT DOCTOR ORDERED; MODERN MEDICINE HAS COME A LONG WAY IN HELPING 
ATHLETES RECOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask Jim Karsatos, former Sunny Hills High standout who went on to play college 
and pro football, how far medical technology has come in the last decade and 
he'll point to the scars on his left and right knees. 
</P>
<P>
 On Karsatos' right knee is a 14-inch scar from an operation that repaired the 
medial collateral ligament he damaged during the 1981 Orange County high school 
all-star game. While playing for the Miami Dolphins in 1987, Karsatos suffered 
a more severe knee injury, a torn anterior cruciate ligament. 
</P>
<P>
 The scar? Two inches long. 
</P>
<P>
 Now an investment manager for John Hancock in Columbus, Ohio, Karsatos marvels 
at players who recover from arthroscopic knee surgery in three weeks and he 
wonders what kind of college and pro career he might have had if he had had 
access to present-day medicine in his day. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Karsatos two years to recover from his first injury and he never came 
back after his second injury. While reflecting on his injury-shortened career, 
Karsatos, 31, acknowledges he never did fully recover from his first scar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strength doesn't get up to what it was and you can feel it getting 
looser," he said. "Your confidence just isn't the same. I had to really gear up 
my arm more than I used to once I got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to roll out in high school. But in college, I stayed in the pocket 
strong instead of trying to get out and run. I knew I couldn't outrun anybody 
in the Big 10, so I didn't even try." 
</P>
<P>
 His surgery caused him to lose his freshman year of eligibility and to be a 
redshirt another year, but Karsatos still started for 2 1/2 seasons and led the 
Buckeyes to a share of the Big 10 championship as a senior. He also finished 
his career fourth all-time on the Buckeye passing yardage list with 5,089 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Karsatos believes he might have been higher on that list had today's 
technology been available to his surgeon, Dr. Lewis Yocum, 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The physical part was done in a year, but the mental part was also a year," 
said Karsatos, who is also working for the Ohio State radio network. "You look 
back and you say that there's fate here and fate there. And then you say, 'Move 
on.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But while he has moved on, Karsatos said whenever he and other NFL alumni get 
together, the first topic of conversation is typically the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they seem to do is talk about their injuries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Gonzalez, a Times All-County football and basketball player at Huntington 
Beach who is a freshman at Cal, also suffered a knee injury in the Orange 
County all-star football game. His injury wasn't serious and did not require 
surgery. In fact, Gonzalez recovered in less than two months and played in 
Cal's second game this season. Last week against UCLA, he caught his first 
touchdown pass in college. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal trainer Mike Chaplin, who helped treat Gonzalez, said severe knee injuries 
aren't what they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "The treatment of anterior cruciate ligaments has changed dramatically over 
the years," he said. "We know a lot more now about the workings of the knee. 
Back in the 1960s, they didn't even fix anterior cruciate injuries, because 
they didn't have the technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bernard King (former NBA All-Star) was one of the first players who came back 
from ACL surgery, but now there are people, like Mark Price and Tim Hardaway 
(NBA Dream Team II point guards), who come back in less than a year. Just by 
looking at that, you can say that things have improved." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are knees, such as Gonzalez's, that heal naturally and 
dramatically, no matter what the era. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't watch much film of him in high school," Chaplin said, "But if he 
gets any better than this, he may only be here a couple years."

CHRIS FOSTER: MATER DEI AT HEART OF ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome to the Mater Dei Section. 
</P>
<P>
 No pushing. 
</P>
<P>
 No shoving. 
</P>
<P>
 No Rialto Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
 On your left is a life-size wax figure of basketball coach Gary McKnight. 
Notice the 10 championship rings. Why only 10? He only has 10 fingers. There's 
10 more in those freebie sneakers. Next year, the nose. 
</P>
<P>
 On your right, is football coach Bruce Rollinson. Check out the snarl and the 
authentic foam bubbling from his mouth. It's Bruce getting the team pumped up 
for another championship game. That Bruce, he sure keeps people in stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the Mater Dei Section, we believe in a smooth operation. The Monarchs 
play. The Monarchs win. Everyone is happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, we have championship games. Lots of them. Last year, Los Alamitos lost. 
The year before, Esperanza. The year before . . . oh, I forget. But they lost 
to the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cha-ching.  
</P>
<P>
 What's that, you say? Why it's our cash register. And just look at this photo 
of sold-out Anaheim Stadium. Boy, Mater Dei won big that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't red a pretty color? 
</P>
<P>
 Or . . . 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Orange Section. Please come in. Please, we beg you. 
</P>
<P>
 You noticed the man with the tin cup outside? That's Katella basketball coach 
and our de facto commissioner, Tom Danley -- the guy holding the cardboard 
sign: "Will run a section for food." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we waited years to have our own little playground. Sixty schools, all 
from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Champions? We got champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Santiago was our football champion. Well, not on the field. We 
couldn't afford to have actual playoffs. So we had the coaches play a video 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Cavaliers were sure tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball? Laguna Beach won. No, not the game. The coin toss. The Artists 
called heads. We held it outside The Pond. It's cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, those Laguna Beach kids really went nuts. We had to let them cut 
down the nets. It was after a Clipper game. We sneaked in. We couldn't afford 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Roooooooaaaaar.  
</P>
<P>
 What's that, you say? Oh, that's the Mater Dei-Eisenhower Southern Section 
championship game over at Anaheim Stadium. Yeah, 35,000 people. But, you know, 
we can't stand crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why we're in the Orange Section. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There it is, choose your poison? 
</P>
<P>
 Come Thursday, a little vote will be taken at the Southern Section Council 
meeting. An Orange Section, to be or not to be? 
</P>
<P>
 It has been building for a few years. County superintendents want it. Well, 
most of them. A couple still straddle the fence. The Anaheim and Fullerton 
districts are holding out, waiting for the CIF strategic planning committee to 
finish its work. By the way, all three of its proposals have county sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, many coaches are against such a section. They see it as a little 
too neighborly, with a devalued championship trophy as the reward. 
</P>
<P>
 But a passive observer can see a bigger flaw. That cash-cow of a school known 
as Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County diocese met a couple weeks ago to discuss whether the three 
large Catholic schools would join the secession movement or remain with the 
Southern Section. A key question. 
</P>
<P>
 Lose Mater Dei and you lose some big bucks in your cash-crop sports. Keep 
Mater Dei and you play for second place. With the Monarchs, financial security. 
Without them, competitive equity. Tough choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Yup, the Monarchs are a double-edge sword. Love them or hate them, people pay 
to watch them. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange Section will either be parochial or very parochial. You'll either be 
in the red or see it.

 After running his usual blistering first mile, Sanchez had no competition at 
the Orange County Championships Saturday at Irvine Regional Park. "I heard 
someone say he was in the 4:30s in the first mile, which is pretty scary for 
the other guys," Capistrano Valley Coach Gary Gross said."A lot of people think 
he's being a maniac, but he's comfortable going out that fast." Sanchez 
finished the 3.1-mile course in 15:13 and won the race by 15 seconds. Sanchez, 
who won the Southern Section Division I-AA title last year, also ran 15:11 for 
three miles to help the Cougars to a dual-meet victory over San Clemente.

 DeVera started the week slowly, falling behind 2-5 and love-40 to Canyon's 
Shannon Wilkins, but from that point she was a different player. She beat 
Wilkins, 7-6 (7-0 in the tiebreaker), and beat her next two opponents, 6-0, to 
lead the then-No. 8 Spartans to a 10-8 victory over then-No. 4 Canyon Monday. 
Tuesday, she didn't lose a game in a 15-3 victory over Foothill. Thursday, she 
became the first player to beat El Modena's Brandi Freudenberg this

"It was really fun to watch," Villa Park Coach Sue Gardiner said. "Faye was 
just determined that she was going to play well." She won her next to sets, 
6-0, 6-1, as the Spartans won, 13-5, to improve to 10-1 and 6-0 in the Century

NOTEBOOK; SANTA ANA VALLEY GAME IS SUBJECT OF PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley officials have filed a protest as a result of the Falcons' 
21-17 loss to Canyon Friday night, Athletic Director Leon Smith said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said they are protesting a controversial and bizarre play at the end of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Smith, Santa Ana Valley's Jason Parrott attempted a pass that 
Greg Jacobs intercepted with 11 seconds left. Jacobs, the county interception 
leader, began celebrating but was never tackled. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Jacobs then threw down the ball and Santa Ana Valley's Tyson Lewis 
tried to recover it. Canyon Coach Bob Hughes then came on the field and jumped 
on the football. Lewis wrestled the ball loose and began running toward the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials whistled the play dead. They awarded Santa Ana Valley the football 
and penalized the Comanches 15 yards. The Falcons attempted a running play but 
did not score. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said officials ruled the ball dead because the ball was touched on the 
field by someone not in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley officials claim the team should be awarded a touchdown and 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Anderson, Canyon's athletic director, said Hughes picked up the ball out 
of instinct but put it right back down and the play was whistled dead without a 
Santa Ana Valley player near the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Century League officials will probably hold a hearing this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the 10 Tustin football players suspended from last Friday's game 
against Servite will be reinstated, Principal Bob Boies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 players -- eight of them starters -- were suspended last Thursday for 
violating the school's athletic code. None, however, were suspended from 
school. They are expected to be in uniform and could play Saturday when Tustin 
meets Santa Ana. At least two of the players practiced with the team Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, it was a one-game suspension," Boies said. "But we had to take a 
stand." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials are expected to decide, possibly today, the fate of three 
players who were involved in an additional incident, Boies said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Canyon girls' tennis team fell from the unbeaten ranks and from fourth to 
ninth in the Orange County coaches polls after close Century League losses to 
Villa Park and El Modena. But the Comanches (12-2) get a chance to avenge the 
first loss Thursday at Villa Park, which moved from eighth to seventh in the 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 In Canyon's 10-8 loss to Villa Park last week, No. 1 Shannon Wilkins blew a 
5-2 lead to Villa Park's No. 1 Faye DeVera, and No. 2 Kim Westerman lost a 4-2 
lead in one of her sets. Wilkins' 7-6 loss to DeVera was only her second in 39 
sets. A victory by Villa Park (9-1, 5-0) would put the Spartans in the driver's 
seat for the Century League title. 
</P>
<P>
 In another key match Thursday, third-ranked Newport Harbor plays at 
fourth-ranked Corona del Mar. The match could decide the Sea View League title 
and the second-seeded team in the upcoming Southern Section Division I 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor, led by No. 1 singles player Sarah Hawkins, was beaten by 
Corona del Mar this season. But a Sailor victory Thursday could tie them with 
the Sea Kings (9-3, 5-0) for first place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor, the top-ranked girls' volleyball team in Orange County, and 
seventh-ranked Calvary Chapel each will play two of the state's best at the 
Rams Challenge in the Spanos Center Saturday at the University of Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor, the No. 1-ranked team in the state, will play San Jose 
Archbishop Mitty, ranked eighth, at 10 a.m. Calvary Chapel, ranked 13th in the 
state, plays Archbishop Mitty at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton St. Mary's, ranked third in the state, will play Calvary Chapel at 3

 To commemorate Sonora's first victory over La Habra High since 1979, Athletic 
Director John Link sat in front of the student body Monday and let the seniors 
cut off his hair. Link's offer had been a standing one for two years at Sonora, 
and Friday's 24-12 victory let the football team collect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to think of something motivational and fun," Link said. "We were 
going to do it Friday after the game, but they forgot to bring the clippers." 
</P>
<P>
 Link said the toughest part will be to convince his wife it is him when he 
gets home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having been a coach before, she is used to me doing some weird things," he 
said. "But I still think she'll be shocked when I get in tonight."

 Earnings: Time Warner Inc., meeting analyst expectations, said its loss 
narrowed in the third quarter to $35 million, compared to a loss from 
operations of $111 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 23% to $1.88 
billion.The media and entertainment company, which owns such businesses as the 
Warner Bros. studio and the HBO cable channel, said earnings before interest, 
taxes, depreciation and amortization -- considered a key barometer for the 
debt-laden firm -- rose 2.9% in the quarter, to $747 million from $726 million 
in the year-earlier period. Filmed entertainment's earnings before taxes fell 
7.4% to $189 million in the quarter from a year earlier, when the division's 
numbers were boosted significantly by the success of "The Bodyguard" on video. 
For the nine months, Time Warner narrowed its loss to $112 million from $286 
million in the year-earlier period.
