the latest in a steady stream of reporters and anchors who have left Channel 4 
recently. Aragon, the "Today in L.A." morning anchor, had most recently been 
filling in on the 4 p.m. news. No official reason was given for her departure, 
and Aragon, who had been with KNBC since 1983, could not be reached for 
comment. Cathy Vara, a reporter with the station, will take over the morning 
news duties. Among others who have left KNBC News recently are reporter Rebecca 
Aguilar; anchor Linda Alvarez, now at KCBS; and reporter David Garcia and 
anchor John Beard, both now at Fox News.

 Schell Speaks Out: Academy Award-winning actor-director Maximilian Schell 
responded Monday to charges of sexual harassment filed against him recently by 
a Kushner-Locke post-production executive. Schell issued a statement saying he 
is "grateful" for the suit because it allows him to address "a series of issues 
which have become accepted in our society," including "witch hunts," "celebrity 
stalking" and "the hypocrisy and false morality of a television mentality which 
. . . suppresses the expression of love." Schell, 63, is accused, among other 
things, of repeatedly commenting about the breasts of former Kushner-Locke 
executive Diana Botsford, 32. He also said: ". . . our society has come to the 
conclusion that it is an offense to find the female bosom beautiful. For all 
lovers of art, this is a very sad day (when) a simple compliment now can be 
turned into a lawsuit." Schell also hinted at legal actions of his own, 
accusing Botsford of "murder of the soul" and saying: "In our profession, 
assassination of the name is assassination of the person, and it should be 
prosecuted accordingly."

Reynolds' CBS sitcom "Evening Shade." Custody of the couple's 5-year-old son, 
Quinton, must still be arranged in Los Angeles County Superior Court. QUICK

 A man carrying a love letter to Janet Jackson was arrested in New York after 
he allegedly stabbed and critically wounded a pedestrian, police said Monday. 
Darryl Wright, 28, was said to be carrying a "rambling love letter" addressed 
to Jackson, at the bottom of which were the phrases "kill everyone" and "attack 
on sight." . . . Pop star Whitney Houston will receive the Sammy Davis Jr. 
Award for entertainer of the year, and singer Barry White will get the Heritage 
Award for career achievement at the eighth annual Soul Train Music Awards to be 
held March 15 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. . . . Miramax Films' 
"The Crying Game" and "The Piano," Universal Pictures/Amblin Entertainment's 
"Jurassic Park" and "Schindler's List," and Warner Bros.' "The Fugitive" are 
the nominees for the Film Information Council's Charles M. Powell Award for the 
Best Marketed Motion Picture of 1993. The winning film will be announced Feb.

CHILDREN'S MUSIC; CRAIG 'N CO. BOOST SPIRITS

 Call him the stress buster. Walt Disney Records' dynamic children's rock 'n' 
roller, Craig Taubman, and his Craig 'n Co. band, lifted spirits with an upbeat 
sing-along concert at Burbank High School Auditorium on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 A benefit for Daniel Bridge, a young Burbank boy with a rare blood disease, 
and the American Lutheran Elementary School, the concert was also a break for 
families from the stresses of the past week. The group's next concert is at the 
Museum of Flying in Santa Monica at 1 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a decibel level that at times was too high, the foot-stompin', 
finger-poppin' songs about hair cuts, car trips, boredom, sibling rivalry and 
baby sitters won continuous smiles from children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret to Craig 'n Co.'s success, apart from the inexhaustible physicality 
of Taubman's performance, his confident vocals and and his band's musical 
expertise, is the singer's remarkable gift for involving his audience. 
</P>
<P>
 With a combination of humorous coaxing, infectious enthusiasm and the instinct 
to know when not to push it, Taubman persuades moms, dads and other adults to 
wave their arms, twist and shimmy, clap and sing in the aisles and on stage, 
right along with the kindergarten set. 
</P>
<P>
 He can also ease smoothly into a lullaby mode these days, something he wasn't 
as comfortable with in the past. On Sunday, Taubman brought his preschool-age 
son on stage, held him close and crooned a quiet ballad about unity. Closing 
the set, he and the band -- Mike Turner, Joel Bennett, Robert Aguilar and Jim 
Blazer -- deftly harmonized in a gentle, a capella doo-wop dialogue between 
father and child. 
</P>
<P>
 Always a crowd-pleaser, even in his early years, Taubman seems to have left 
behind past lyric awkwardness and what was sometimes an over-the-top nervous 
energy. He and his band have matured into one of the most enjoyable acts in 
children's music. But, do turn the volume down, please. 
</P>
<P>
 * Craig 'n Co., Museum of Flying, 2772 Donald Douglas Loop North, Santa 
Monica, Sunday at 1 p.m. $8 (ages 2 and under); (310) 392-8822.

WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; TICKET SALES UP DESPITE MOTHER NATURE

<P>
 Despite the bad weather in the East and the earthquake in Southern California, 
ticket sales were 13% ahead of the same weekend a year ago. In many instances, 
the cold weather motivated people to go out to the movies and escape cabin 
fever.

 The intersection of Richard Gere and Sharon Stone turned out to be no problem 
for "Philadelphia" and the intrepid "Mrs. Doubtfire" to pass through. All three 
films posted respectable grosses for the weekend, except that "Intersection," 
in its first weekend, only did the level of business that "Mrs. Doubtfire" is 
still doing after nine weeks in the Top Ten. "Philadelphia" is showing strength 
in national release despite what was perceived to be its off-putting 
AIDS-related storyline. 04,26,18,10,10 Weekend Gross/ Screens/ Weeks in Movie

TV REVIEW; CRONKITE TAKES A LOOK AT 'OUR FAMILIES, OUR FUTURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We know all about the disintegration of the American family and the epidemics 
in juvenile crime, teen pregnancies and child abuse. Now, for the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Our Families, Our Future" (at 11 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28), host 
Walter Cronkite takes viewers on an encouraging tour of experimental family 
support programs across the country. In innovative, cost-effective ways, 
at-risk parents and children are learning the skills necessary to function as a 
family unit, diminishing the potential for serious problems that cost the 
United States $13 billion annually for the juvenile justice system and foster 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the many programs highlighted: In Tennessee, a family preservation 
program ameliorates abusive situations that go to court with months of 
intensive crisis intervention; 70% of families are still together after a year. 
</P>
<P>
 A program in Tucson, Ariz., goes even further. Screening new parents in 
maternity wards, it determines the potential for child abuse and counsels those 
at risk for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Cleveland, Ohio, young fathers who have abandoned their children 
are taught to value them, to become part of their lives and to take legal 
responsibility for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Society tends to demand instant remedies, even when a longer view could save 
money and be more effective. This thoughtful documentary by Roger Weisberg 
shows that short-term, punitive measures are clearly inferior to inclusive, 
preventive programs that offer emotional support, information and education. 
</P>
<P>
 One question for KCET, though: Why give something so hopeful such a throwaway 
time slot?

MUSIC REVIEW; PERICK LEADS LACO IN PROGRAM OF MOZART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What better to ease earthquake jitters than a concert of Mozart? But there was 
little ease in Cristof Perick's Mozart Friday night, as he led his Los Angeles 
Chamber Orchestra at Wadsworth Theater in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The driving force behind Perick's Mozart is drive.He apparently likes his 
rhythms inflected tightly, his phrases sculpted tautly. Releases are pointed, 
trills compact, grace notes popped. In short, everything is pert. It's as if 
Mozart were a gymnast, a samurai or an earlier incarnation of Stravinsky, not 
an essentially lyrical composer. 
</P>
<P>
 One, however, certainly can't fault the conductor for not getting what he sets 
out for. These were performances polished to a sheen, if not very resplendent 
in the dull Wadsworth acoustic; the LACO responded nimbly to his every twitch, 
it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
 The program opened with the rich and charming Three Marches, K. 408 -- but 
Perick just stopped after two. Later, Ute Selbig, a soprano from Dresden, 
offered the concert arias "Misera, Dove Son?" K. 369, and "Bella Mia Fiamma, 
Addio!" K. 528. Her voice proved agile, gaining in blush as it went higher, and 
relishing leaps. She sang both works with considerable shading and poise while 
not quite registering their pathos. 
</P>
<P>
 LACO principal Kenneth Munday wrung every last bit of nuance out of the 
Bassoon Concerto, K. 191, even in cadenza cliches and cadential formulas. 
Sometimes it was too much; at others -- in virtuosic moments -- his strong 
technique won over. 
</P>
<P>
 Perick's interpretation of the "Jupiter" Symphony worked best -- buoyant, 
directional -- when Mozart's music is at its most formal. It sounded less 
effective and more limited where sprung rhythms don't count as much, where 
gentleness and a simple tunefulness can score points all on their own. TIMOTHY 
MANGAN

AL MARTINEZ: WHERE TIME IS FORGOTTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If James Barrie was correct in concluding that God gave us memory so we would 
have roses in winter, I have been to a place where there are no roses. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a home for Alzheimer patients in San Gabriel called Mission Lodge. There, 
in a tree-shaded setting whose beauty is all but lost on its occupants, abide 
victims of a disease that eats at one's very soul. 
</P>
<P>
 It erodes memory first and then time itself, trapping those who suffer its 
worst effects in a place where there is no light and there are no doors. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to Mission Lodge in pursuit of an idea whose gimmickry dulled in the 
face of reality. I wanted to write a first-of-the-year column that had 
something to do with time. 
</P>
<P>
 I do that almost every January. Last year it was a clock repairman surrounded 
by a bedlam of ticking and bonging. The year before that, a woman who had lived 
a hundred years. 
</P>
<P>
 This year I decided I would write about a place where time is forgotten, 
applying a twist to an idea that now seems inadequate. I looked around for a 
facility that dealt with Alzheimer patients; a place where there is no time. 
</P>
<P>
 I remembered a friend named Esther whom I had watched slip gradually into the 
mind's abyss, and prevailed upon her husband to take me to the home where she 
will spend the rest of her life. That brought me to Mission Lodge, a nursing 
facility founded almost a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Its hacienda setting, graceful pine trees and illustrious gardens are Esther's 
coffin. There she spends her fading days, half-smile fixed on the face of a 
mannequin, eyes staring out at a world that no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Lodge represents a small corner of Alzheimer's savagery. Four million 
Americans suffer from the disease, more than 100,000 in L.A. County. It's the 
fourth leading cause of death among older people. 
</P>
<P>
 When I arrived at the San Gabriel home, time was still the point of my being 
there, to expand an idea into a workable essay; time and memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "They remember only this moment," Carol DeMarco explained as she led me down a 
bright corridor. "That's the time that's important to them. Now. This instant." 
</P>
<P>
 She's Mission Lodge's administrator, 30 years in nursing, three years at the 
Lodge. There are 153 patients, both men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are different levels to Alzheimer's," she said. "It begins from the 
moment you feel something's wrong but can't put your finger on it, until you 
lose yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it was with Esther. First a vague notion that something was 
amiss, then a loss of memory and a loss of function . . . and a loss of self. 
Dignity died midway through the descent. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of those at the lodge are comatose. They dwell in different stages of 
the disease. Some have regressed to their childhood and clutch stuffed toys, 
living in a Peter Pan world where no one ever grows old. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas was a special time for them. They loved Santa. Later, there was no 
memory of the day, but for that moment they came alive. "It's what we hope 
for," DeMarco said. "Happiness, however brief, is important in a place where 
remembering a name is a triumph." 
</P>
<P>
 She led me through rooms and corridors of men and women walking aimlessly, of 
others in wheelchairs, some with walkers . . . and still others in the last 
stages of their lives, dying in a dementia that's dark and lonely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The disease takes strange turns. One patient, a former teacher, tried to leave 
the home every day at three in the afternoon. Research revealed it was once the 
time she left school to help children cross the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have their agendas," DeMarco said. "We just don't always know what they 
are. Those who don't go back to their childhood retreat to a time when they 
were happy or when something wasn't resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who fought to leave at three each day was assured that a crossing 
guard had been hired and the children were safe. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried without success to speak to a few of the patients. Some simply stared 
back. One repeated every last sentence. One sang an unintelligible song in a 
childlike voice from somewhere in her past. One rocked a doll in endless 
rhythm, as though it were the baby she once held in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no mirrors at Mission Lodge. The patients' own images frighten them. 
The face that looks back isn't the person they remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know who they were," DeMarco says, "but not who they are. Some have 
photos on their walls of who they were. They stare at them and seem to think, 
'I know that person. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 As I left Mission Lodge, I looked back at Esther. The half-smile remained 
fixed. The gaze was still straight ahead. She'll never get better. I wish she 
had roses.

BIGOTRY WATCH; DISGUSTING DIATRIBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson has assailed the evil, racist and anti-Semitic message 
spread recently at a New Jersey college by a representative of Louis Farrakhan. 
Jackson's welcome condemnation should help check the spread of such ignorant 
and harmful diatribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has also called on Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, to 
respond. Farrakhan insists that he wants to reach out to Jews. He says he is 
trying to present a more tolerant image. One way he could demonstrate his 
sincerity would be to denounce his representative, Khalid Abdul Muhammed, for 
the vitriolic remarks in which he irrationally and specifically blamed Jews for 
the ills of the world, attacked the Pope and advocated killing white South 
Africans including women and babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this what Farrakhan himself believes? He, too, has said some despicable 
things about Jews, particularly during Jackson's 1984 campaign for the 
presidency. Recently, however, he has insisted he is respectful. Here's a 
chance for him to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Many legitimate black leaders, most notably U.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), 
who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, Ben Chavis of the NAACP, William 
Gray of the United Negro College Fund and Mary Francis Berry, who heads the 
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, have publicly deplored the demagoguery. Their 
strong stance is admirable. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatemongers come in all colors. Bigotry knows no boundaries. The black Muslim 
who spewed this garbage should be muzzled by Farrakhan and condemned by all.

THE FIRM GRASP OF A HELPING HAND; AFTERSHOCKS FAIL TO SHAKE A WONDERFUL AND 
GROWING SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The earth is still shaking -- but Los Angeles' newfound sense of community is 
growing firmer with each passing hour. In one magnificent gesture after 
another, the people of earthquake-racked Southern California are reaching out 
with assistance to victims of last week's 6.6 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 THE 'OUTSIDERS': From all over the region people have come to Los Angeles to 
help. From as far south as San Diego, technicians arrived to aid the Southern 
California Gas Co. in restoring natural gas service. From Ventura and Orange 
counties, volunteers of all sorts -- and supplies of all kinds, from blankets 
to medicines to toys -- flowed in to meet basic needs and to lift spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles school officials initially feared that as many as 100,000 students 
might be without classrooms this week. But that distressing number quickly was 
reduced to just 9,000 -- and the number of classrooms deemed unusable dropped 
from 1,500 on Saturday to just 500 by Sunday afternoon as crews worked through 
the weekend, shoring up walls and removing rubble. Officials are hoping to get 
that number down to 300 by today or Wednesday. Great work! 
</P>
<P>
 The National Guard came with prudent alacrity. No replay of the delay that 
occurred in the 1992 riots. And what about the alert work of the Police 
Department? Remember the 1992 debacle, when agonizing hours passed before the 
LAPD could get its act together? What a difference a new police chief, and a 
new mayor, can make. And, speaking of Mayor Richard Riordan, he has been all 
over town, coordinating post-quake operations with flair and competence. 
</P>
<P>
 THE LEADERSHIP: State and city workers have performed beyond the call of duty; 
whether inspired by leaders or the challenge of the moment, sanitation crews, 
building and safety inspectors and providers of social services and housing, 
among others, have responded splendidly. 
</P>
<P>
 And the federal government's profile seems higher than in earlier disasters. 
No doubt President Clinton's visit last week set the tone. The Federal 
Emergency Management Agency already has accepted nearly 64,000 applications for 
help and disbursed $1.8 million in checks for temporary housing. The Department 
of Housing and Urban Development, which in the past steered clear of emergency 
situations, is now fully and productively involved. Housing Secretary Henry G. 
Cisneros responded with 10,000 new and coveted rental subsidies. He also 
streamlined the certification process so that poor families who lost everything 
in the quake could move quickly from tent cities and shelters to apartments. 
The first victims moved in on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD SAMARITANS: Disaster officials are also paying attention to hard-hit 
areas away from the epicenter in the San Fernando Valley. Residents of Santa 
Monica, Hollywood, Pico-Union, Inglewood and South Los Angeles lost their 
homes, too, and businesses in those areas -- notably the Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw 
Mall -- suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Crenshaw district, an elderly disabled woman stood in line for more 
than five hours Thursday at the FEMA center. She had no electricity and needed 
food. When the woman learned that FEMA normally doesn't provide those services, 
she left empty-handed. Fortunately, Carolyn Webb de Macias, the chief of staff 
for Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, intervened. She found the woman at a bus 
stop and gave her food coupons provided by the Lucky's supermarket chain. Also, 
another good Samaritan left her place in line at that FEMA center to drive a 
sobbing young woman to a nearby homeless shelter. She was only one of thousands 
who put others first at assistance centers and stores and on the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this adds up to a new spirit worth preserving -- a spirit that Mayor 
Riordan insists won't, this time, evaporate in a few weeks. We sincerely hope 
he is proven right.

GOOD RULING, BAD LAW; COURT MAKES RIGHT CALL, BUT RICO IS A WORRISOME GRAB BAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court's unanimous decision Monday permitting use of a federal 
anti-racketeering law against anti-abortion protesters sends two strong and 
clear messages. 
</P>
<P>
 The first: Militant groups such as Operation Rescue that try to blockade 
clinics and harass women seeking abortions could be engaging in a conspiracy 
even though they are motivated by moral or political principle rather than 
financial gain.In light of the ruling, these protest groups should now finally 
acknowledge that their First Amendment right to express their opposition to 
abortion does not extend to physical intimidation or violence.  
</P>
<P>
 The second: A congressional review of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act is very much in order. The 1970 statute was originally 
directed against the conspiratorial activities of the so-called crime families. 
However, the law is so loosely worded that any two instances of illegal conduct 
within a 10-year period can, if they involve telephones or mail, be prosecuted 
as a pattern of racketeering activity. The RICO act has been invoked against 
Chicago commodity brokers, Los Angeles slumlords, Wall Street financiers and 
Huntington Beach traffic cops. Absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, some RICO prosecutions under this vague and excessively 
broad statute have impinged on the due-process rights of defendants. Critics 
charge they also have led to prison sentences and assessments of damages far 
beyond the bounds of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress is moving to eliminate any doubt that might remain about the legality 
of violent anti-abortion protest. Both the House and the Senate have passed 
versions of the Freedom of Access to Clinics Act and soon will consider a 
conference version. Congress should now turn its attention to RICO.

 In response to "Ways Sought to Lead Poor Onto Information Highway," Jan. 11: 
</P>
<P>
 One only needs to look at Val Verde Unified School District to see how it can 
be done. Val Verde School District, 15 miles south of Riverside, is composed of 
a very broad socioeconomic group.In five or six years we have gone from a 
handful of computers to almost 1,000 computers in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The article quoted MacWorld Magazine's Charles Piller, saying that the 
computer in the classroom should go to the teacher first, and that there should 
be sophisticated in-service training. We have done that. Two years ago, 
teachers who completed 40 hours of training received a computer for their use. 
During the past two years we have installed a districtwide network putting a 
sophisticated workstation on 80% of the teachers' desks -- all of which are 
connected directly to the Internet. In addition to the initial training, we 
offer ongoing training.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course we haven't left the students out. The district technology trainer 
visits classrooms and assists the teachers in training the students on the use 
of the computer. We now have students in grades four through 12 using the 
computers and the network to compose and publish their school newspapers.

SINGLE-RACE, SINGLE-SEX SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Boys Only: Separate but Equal?" (Jan. 15), Janny Scott reported a 
criticism that segregating the sexes to improve the education of black males 
was unjustifiable for lack of hard research. The importance of "gut feelings" 
(of African American educators?) is undervalued, yet such feelings are often 
the result of observations that lead to hypotheses and research. The lack of 
"hard proof" in this area is more a function of the nature of research, 
particularly social research, as I found to my chagrin 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 I had posited that underachievement in minority groups was due to the fear of 
success. The results (confounded by methodological problems) suggested that 
while low achievement in blacks did seem to be due to fear of success in 
competition (for money) against whites, in females it was rather the function 
of fear of failure as women. Fourteen-year-old females and blacks competed more 
aggressively against their peer group than against the more powerful social 
groups (males, whites). 
</P>
<P>
 Collusion between the sexes was evident, in that males did not have to work 
much harder to beat the females on a task at which females traditionally do 
better (and on which they had scored higher on the pretest). Blacks (of both 
genders) continued to accept the unspoken rule that it was dangerous to compete 
with whites; but whites apparently did not realize this, as evidenced by their 
aggressive competition against blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, black males are similar in achievement orientation to females, 
particularly white females, given the fact that black females generally perform 
better professionally than their male counterparts. Consequently, separating 
the sexes in eduction may serve the same purpose for black males as for females 
in general. It may provide the opportunity to develop expectations of what is 
possible and to gain leadership experience without excessive social pressures 
related to sex and race.

 Segregating public-school classes based on race may have its justifications, 
but among them is not Jawanza Kunjufu's absurd notion that black boys have a 
racially particular learning style: "shorter attention spans, higher energy 
levels, competitiveness, and stronger motor skills." I taught elementary and 
high school classes -- 100% black, mostly boys, 60 in a classroom -- for two 
years, and found them respectful, attentive, hard-working, and cooperative . . 
. much more so than white students I know. Was it because my students were 
expected to conform to adult standards, rather than vice-versa? If so, then 
American schools and educators have a lot to learn from West African ones, and 
foremost among the lessons is that racial stereotypes are stupid.

a question comes to my mind; if single-sex education is good for one why is it

 The planned conference at Cleveland High School excluding all but black

Nineteen percent of the students are white, and there is a 57% Latino 
enrollment.

 Question: If a whites-only conference were to be proposed to enhance their 
accomplishments, does anyone want to guess at the politically correct reactions

BOBBY RAY INMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was with a huge sense of disappointment and relief that I watched retired 
Navy Adm. Bobby Ray Inman withdraw his name from President Clinton's secretary 
of defense post (Jan. 19).I was profoundly disappointed because I know 
firsthand what a capable defense secretary he would be. I worked directly for 
Inman twice in my career and I know of no other person who approaches, much 
less rivals, his integrity, leadership and vision -- qualities sorely needed in 
formulating today's national security strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My relief stems from my belief that both he and his lovely family have paid 
their public service dues many times over. The fact that within minutes of his 
withdrawal announcement many journalists, pundits and political hacks were 
whispering darkly about the probability of "other unspoken problems" with his 
confirmation only serves to emphasize Inman's point: We're in a new age of 
McCarthyism, where anyone can say anything with little or no accountability. 
Accept him at his word -- he didn't want the job! And who would? 
</P>

<P>
 Has Washington sunk so deep that no one saw from the very first day of Inman's 
nomination that this man is inordinately insecure and far too neurotic for any 
public office? No matter what his credentials (all of which are tarnished by 
consistently irresponsible behavior), has Washington become so effete that no 
one from Senate or House would point out Inman's imbalance? Is it not clear 
from interviews and press conferences that this man is aggressive, ineffectual 
and insolent? 
</P>
<P>
 Thank God that his own paranoia forced him to withdraw from nomination to this 
potentially sensitive position.

PERRY TO THE RESCUE; PENTAGON'S NO. 2 OFFICIAL IS NOMINATED TO BE PENTAGON'S 
NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to end his problems with leadership at the Pentagon, President Clinton 
has persuaded an apparently reluctant William J. Perry, its experienced No. 2 
official, to take on the top job. Influential members of Congress welcome that 
choice, and leaders of the uniformed services, whose trust and confidence Perry 
is said to have earned, should as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, at the age of 66, has long since acquired impressive credentials in 
education, industry and government service. Among his major accomplishments is 
fostering secret research during a previous stint at the Pentagon in the 1970s 
into Stealth aviation technology, over the resistance of some top Air Force 
officials. The Stealth fighter proved its worth many times over in the air war 
against Iraq in early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 As deputy secretary of defense Perry has had the demanding and unpopular job 
of reordering how the Pentagon spends about $100 billion a year on acquisition 
and research. If confirmed as secretary, he will be the lead policy-maker in 
trying to reconcile all those things the military is expected or would like to 
be able to do with its reduced means in this era of much tighter budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 In turning to the tested Perry, the President hopes to put behind him a 
disappointing and embarrassing year of searching for competent Pentagon 
leadership. Departing Defense Secretary Les Aspin, one of Congress' brightest 
defense experts, proved weak as a policy-maker. Bobby Ray Inman, who had wowed 
Washington in earlier military and intelligence jobs, chose for reasons still 
unclear to say "no" to the honor after first saying "yes." Clinton's third time 
around, with William Perry, at last should prove the charm.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARIES; THE PROBLEM UP-CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YVONNE B. BURKE, Supervisor Yvonne B. Burke represents the Second District, 
which includes Ladera Heights. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ordinance that would limit the right to solicit employment in public 
rights-of-way -- such as streets and sidewalks -- within 500 feet of a church, 
school, park or residence -- was introduced after more than a year of 
attempting to resolve this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 This ordinance resulted from a loud outcry from residents of Ladera Heights. 
More than 200 came together in a meeting demanding a stop to job solicitation 
that had become a public nuisance. Photos have been taken of people urinating 
in public. Women and children are harassed as they walk along the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 We tried a number of solutions. For one thing, we discussed it with Home Base, 
where laborers gather to solicit prospective employers outside the store. We 
asked if Home Base could select a site on their property for employment 
referrals. They responded that the property owners' insurance would not cover 
their liability. Home Base added that they are unable to ask people to leave 
without a county ordinance in place allowing them to post a notice forbidding 
employment solicitation on their property. This same problem is being 
experienced by the church and the gas station across the street.  
</P>
<P>
 It should be made very clear that this has no ethnic or racial overtones 
whatsoever. The people who reside in that community are multiethnic -- in fact, 
it's largely a minority community, and by that I mean not just African 
Americans; there are Latino, Asian and some white residents there as well.  
</P>
<P>
 There is no intent to deprive anyone of civil rights or of the right of free 
speech. We're very concerned, though, that children should not be subjected to 
the things that they're experiencing, and homeowners should not have this 
problem on their lawns.  
</P>
<P>
 We have received communications from a variety of organizations, including the 
Catholic archdiocese. We have suggested that if any of the concerned 
organizations would like to establish a hiring center on its property, we would 
work with them and get a sign placed at Home Base referring people to that 
facility. Unfortunately, these organizations prefer that the hiring stay at 
Home Base and the neighborhood lawns and parks.  
</P>
<P>
 I have been more than willing to assist with the mediation of this problem, 
and will continue to do so. Having an ordinance that prevents loitering on 
people's lawns and being hired from in front of homes, parks and churches will 
not prevent us from continuing to try to arrive at a solution. The real 
difficulty here is that the people who are involved in this conduct are not the 
ones we are negotiating with; they are attorneys and organizations concerned 
about the broad issue of day-laborer hiring, which is usually done in 
commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, government has a responsibility to protect citizens from what is 
happening in their community.

 Today, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider, 
and probably will approve, an ill-conceived law drafted by Supervisor Yvonne 
Burke. The law, in effect 30 days after board approval, is intended to 
eliminate curbside day-labor pools by criminalizing the act of asking for work 
or otherwise discussing one's availability with an occupant of a vehicle.  
</P>
<P>
 Picture yourself, one of thousands of people with earthquake-damaged homes, 
stopping your car to speak with a contractor working on a neighbor's home; 30 
days from today, if you dare to have a conversation with the contractor while 
sitting in your car, both of you will be subject to arrest, $1,000 in fines and 
six months incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke's law originated in the racially changing neighborhood of Ladera 
Heights, a middle-class, predominantly African American community adjacent to 
Inglewood. As is common throughout the county, Ladera Heights residents and 
businesses hire day laborers for short-term projects. Last year, some of the 
area's residents campaigned against the presence of the predominantly Latino 
day laborers. Responding to the few residents intent on driving the day 
laborers out of Ladera Heights, Burke proposed the drastic "solution" of 
banning curbside hiring throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous civil-rights organizations appealed to Burke, proposing various 
policy alternatives that would address the legitimate and mutual concerns of 
residents and workers and lessen the rising racial and social tensions. These 
organizations specifically offered mediated dispute resolution, which has 
proved successful elsewhere, as a viable alternative to oppressive legislation. 
Organizations with expertise in setting up and managing day-laborer programs 
offered to help create a staffed and regulated hiring site. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, Burke promised to support mediation. But in spite of her 
commitment and in spite of the efforts of residents, laborers and professional 
mediators to reach a meaningful resolution, she has decided to bring the law up 
for a vote today and effectively doom a local community's opportunity to heal 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 If unchecked, a few vocal residents of Ladera Heights also will succeed in 
eliminating the only means of support for thousands of families.  
</P>
<P>
 The racial tensions in Ladera Heights stem in part from the changing racial 
character of that community and hark back to a similar era about 20 years ago. 
In the early 1970s, new African American residents of Ladera Heights found 
themselves faced with the same intolerance facing today's Latino newcomers. 
Some residents of the then-predominantly white neighborhood sought to prevent 
the formation of a basketball league by newly arrived African American 
residents, claiming that people would be "frightened" by groups of black men 
congregating in the park. Residents today point to this same pretextual "fear" 
of groups of men, now Latino, as a justification for violating others' rights. 
Although Burke's law could conceivably apply even to neighborhood kids seeking 
to cut grass and the homeowner sitting in his car in the driveway, it is 
clearly intended to criminalize, and thereby eliminate, Latino day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 The state and federal Constitutions prevent the county from enacting a law 
that explicitly singles out one group of people. Thus Burke's vaguely worded 
law, although attempting to avoid such discrimination, in all likelihood still 
is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Day laborers have been an integral part of Los Angeles' economy for decades. 
When the San Fernando Valley was predominantly agricultural, orchard owners 
relied on day laborers to harvest their crops. In recent years, the shrinking 
economy has forced more people onto day laborer corners in an effort to support 
their families. The existence and location of day-laborer corners is a simple 
factor of supply and demand. The particular corner in Ladera Heights that 
attracted Burke's attention would disappear overnight if local residents did 
not regularly need and benefit from workers for short-term projects. 
</P>
<P>
 This law criminalizes socially and economically beneficial activity , at great 
expense to the taxpayer. A new category of crime will require the use of 
sheriff's deputies, district attorneys, public defenders, court personnel and 
jail space to enforce it. Even ignoring the cost of conducting criminal 
prosecutions and incarcerating convicted day laborers, how does one begin to 
measure the cost to the county when sheriff's deputies spend part of their days 
arresting law-abiding day laborers and not combatting violent crime? And while 
the direct financial costs of this law to the county can be measured, the human 
suffering that will be caused by needless criminal prosecutions and forced 
unemployment of thousands of workers is immeasurable. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than taking on the admittedly more difficult task of crafting public 
policy based on Burke's professed New Year's goal of furthering harmony and 
easing tensions within our community, Burke is choosing the politically 
expedient but ultimately harmful path of punishing workers and their families 
for the "crime" of seeking work.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DERBY DEMOLITION BEGINS AMID PROTESTS 
</P>

 Once the epitome of old Hollywood elegance, the Brown Derby restaurant on Vine 
Street was being demolished Monday despite protests from preservationists that 
the vacant and earthquake-damaged building could have been restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the nightspot complex where Clark Gable proposed marriage to Carole 
Lombard was ripped down after a 1987 fire, but about half was kept -- a 
temporary victory for the Hollywood Heritage preservationist group. Now, some 
state officials and aficionados of Los Angeles history fear that the Brown 
Derby's total demolition sets a bad precedent for other pre-World War II 
buildings harmed in last week's temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we going to lay down our bodies in front of the bulldozers? No. There are 
too many buildings that need to be saved. But what we are asking for is a 
sensible, orderly process to examine these buildings," said historical 
preservationist William Delvac. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that officially designated historic landmarks damaged in 
natural disasters be specially inspected with an eye toward reconstruction -- 
unless the building presents imminent danger to people and other property. The 
Brown Derby on Vine Street is on the National Register of Historic Places as 
part of a large landmark district on and near Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city inspectors ruled that the collapsing roof and crumbling brick 
walls posed immediate threats and they issued a demolition permit Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Wayne Donaldson, chairman of the State Historical Building Safety 
Board, drew a different conclusion after viewing the Brown Derby's exterior 
Thursday as part of an area tour by concerned state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our opinion is that those portions that are damaged could be reconstructed 
and strengthened. There is no need to demolish it," Donaldson said Monday. 
Danger could be avoided by cordoning off the building with protected walkways 
until further studies are done, he added.

 On Monday, workmen were tearing out roof timbers from the three-story Spanish 
Revival structure, which was designed in part by Carl Jules Weyl, architect of 
the Warner Brothers studio. Soon after its opening on Valentine's Day, 1929, 
the Brown Derby on Vine Street was a center of movie-star social life and film 
deal-making until the industry drifted further west. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't save that building. It's all cracked up," said Jodie Wilson, who 
was hired by George Ullman Jr., one of the owners, to supervise the demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson pointed through the elaborate wrought iron gate, complete with the 
initials B.D., that once opened from Vine Street to the Brown Derby's cocktail 
lounge. Insidewas a jumble of fallen beams and bricks, although it was 
impossible to determine whether most of that mess was caused by the demolition 
crew, by the earthquake, by squatters who vandalized the building after its 
1985 closure or by fires in 1987 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood historian Ken Schessler recalls happier times when the Brown Derby 
on Vine was by far the most important of the various eateries in Los Angeles 
that shared the name. "When you walked into that place, you felt like you were 
walking into some kind of sacred ground," he said Monday. "It was the hangout 
of just about everybody and a lot of business was done there, too."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The dining room was lined with autographed caricatures of stars from the 1920s 
through the '60s. Columnists Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons conducted many 
celebrity interviews there. Producers Cecil B. De Mille and Jack Warner were 
among the restaurant's financial backers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Brown Derby had representations of its namesake hat only on its 
floor and on its sign. The original Brown Derby coffee shop on Wilshire 
Boulevard, near the Ambassador Hotel, had a roof built in 1926 to look like a 
derby; that big hat now crowns a mini-mall where the Wilshire eatery once 
stood. Subsequent Brown Derby restaurants operated at various times in Beverly 
Hills, Pasadena, Los Feliz and another Hollywood location. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents Hollywood, said she hopes 
the city's Building and Safety Department does not act so hastily at other 
damaged historic sites. "I'm very disappointed. We certainly wanted to explore 
the opportunity to save the building, but we were told that we don't have a 
choice when it's dangerous," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Heritage official Christine O'Brien contended that the earthquake 
damage is a pretext to allow the owners to achieve their long-held goal of 
razing the Brown Derby for a parking lot. O'Brien alleged that the owners had 
allowed the building to decay for the past few years.  
</P>
<P>
 Calls to owners George Ullman Jr., developer Larry Worchell and the Shilling 
Trust were not returned Monday. They are affiliated with the Ullman's Grant 
Parking firm, which owns adjacent parking lots that will be extended onto the 
entire Brown Derby site. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Buckley, a managing partner of the Ramsey Shilling realty firm handling 
the property, confirmed that the owners wanted a parking lot there. But he 
asserted that they explored renovation before the earthquake and tried many 
times to attract new restaurants and other tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandals had stripped the remaining rooms of their architectural value, Buckley 
said. "It was in very bad shape before the earthquake," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Heritage activists had planned a rally in front of the Brown Derby 
on Valentine's Day, which would have been the restaurant's 65th anniversary. 
That protest over the buiding's decay is now being converted into a funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have a motorcade and roses," said O'Brien. "It will be a sad ending."

TELLY'S FAVORITE HOTEL KNEW HIM AS A REGULAR GUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunday mornings, Telly Savalas would hang around the bar at the 
Sheraton-Universal Hotel, sipping coffee, still in his slippers, watching 
football games on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the line on this one?" someone would ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Savalas would shrug. "I got 6 1/2." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the lollipops and the "Who loves ya, baby?" At this Universal City 
hotel, Savalas was one of the guys. A regular. He kept a third-floor suite and 
was around so often that the management named the downstairs bar after him. He 
spent afternoons in the lobby and evenings in the restaurant, laughing with 
friends, chatting with whoever wandered past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you kidding?" David Cocks, the general manager, says. "This was his 
hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 The past week has been a rough one at the Sheraton. The earthquake left 
substantial damage. Cocks and the regulars at Telly's bar say they were hit 
just as hard when, over the weekend, Savalas died of prostate cancer in his 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not unusual for celebrities to take extended hotel stays. At the Chateau 
Marmont in West Hollywood, owner Andre Balazs regales the inquisitive with a 
litany of guests ranging from Errol Flynn to Robert De Niro, and a tale of 
Sting wandering down to peck a tune on the lobby's piano. 
</P>
<P>
 But such tales carry an aura, the glare of a star deigning to shine among 
commoners. With Savalas and the Sheraton, it was different. He first checked 
into the hotel in 1973, when "Kojak" was taping next door at Universal Studios 
and rigorous production days sometimes stretched past midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He became sort of attached to the place," says Mike Mamakos, a longtime 
friend. "It developed into a 20-year stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was probably with him a thousand times in that hotel, sitting in the lobby, 
sitting in the bar," Mamakos says. "He could be eating a sandwich, you know, 
putting something in his mouth and someone would come over and slap him on the 
back and say, 'How ya doin?' He'd say, 'Delightful.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Savalas and the hotel's manager began chatting about the 
downstairs bar, which wasn't doing much business. Savalas offered a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Why the hell don't we call it Telly's?' " he recalled in a 1992 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor figured he spent enough time in the hotel anyway. And the bar 
combined three of his favorite pastimes: sports, gambling and people. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the football season and the basketball season," he said, "it's a real 
raucous joint." 
</P>
<P>
 Mamakos recalls that Savalas walked into the bar one afternoon and became 
transfixed with a game on the television. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stopped dead in his tracks to watch this great play" and a man cursed at 
Savalas and told him to move, Mamakos says. "The guy didn't know it was Telly 
but Telly just said, 'OK.' He could talk to princes and to the common laborer 
with the same affection." 
</P>
<P>
 So, although he had no monetary stake in the bar, Savalas became a fixture at 
Telly's. Vacationers gawked. Regulars asked which team he liked on the day of 
the game. They challenged him to shoot pool and he rarely declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Telly's will not reopen until early February, after the Super Bowl but before 
the basketball playoffs. Hotel workers say it won't be the same without The 
Man. The regulars, too, will miss him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never heard him say, 'Who loves ya, baby,' and I never saw him with a 
lollipop (Kojak's trademarks) but he was still a character," Gene Lang, a 
customer, says. "He had a presence and whenever I went to Telly's, I was hoping 
he'd be there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me feel good that he didn't pass away in the hospital," Lang said. 
"It's like the cowboy who's buried with his boots on. He died where he liked to 
be."

BOY'S FATHER IN JACKSON CASE WON'T BE CHARGED; INVESTIGATION: SINGER CLAIMED 
PARENT OF ALLEGED MOLESTATION VICTIM TRIED TO EXTORT MONEY FROM HIM. D.A. SAYS 
DECISION NOT TO PROSECUTE IS UNRELATED TO REPORTS THAT SETTLEMENT IS NEAR.

<P>
 Amid signs that a lawsuit accusing Michael Jackson of sexually molesting a 
young boy may soon be settled, prosecutors announced Monday that they will not 
bring charges against the boy's father, whom Jackson and his advisers claimed 
tried to extort money from the entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've declined to file today criminal charges of attempted extortion," said 
Michael J. Montagna, a deputy Los Angeles County district attorney who heads 
that office's organized crime unit. "The evidence does not show that any crime 
has been committed." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's decision, coming after more than five months of 
investigation, represents a major victory for the boy's family, whose 
representatives have denied the extortion allegations for months. The decision 
was criticized by Jackson's former private investigator but praised by the 
lawyer for the boy's father. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased that the district attorney has confirmed my client is innocent 
of any wrongdoing," said the lawyer, Richard Hirsch. "Now all the parties can 
focus on the real issues in this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the sexual abuse allegations surfaced last summer, private 
investigator Anthony Pellicano, then employed by Jackson, publicly accused the 
boy's father and the father's lawyer of trying to extort $20 million from the 
singer. According to Pellicano, the boy's father went public with the 
allegations of abuse only after the extortion attempt failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pellicano released two tape recordings to bolster the extortion claim, and 
Jackson later repeated the accusations. Jackson's advisers lodged a complaint 
with the Police Department, however, only after The Times reported that one had 
not been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Montagna cited the Jackson camp's slowness to act on the extortion claim and 
its willingness to negotiate with the boy's father for several weeks as two 
reasons why prosecutors did not bring an extortion case. Montagna also said the 
discussions between Jackson's representatives and Barry K. Rothman, the 
attorney for the boy's father at that time, appeared to be attempts to settle a 
possible civil case, not efforts to extort money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a crime for attorneys to try to settle a civil action," Montagna 
said. "The law actually favors trying to settle actions without going to 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Monday, Pellicano sharply disputed the argument that the 
discussions were intended to settle a claim out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 "All during the conversations with Barry Rothman, he was stating that 'unless 
we get what we want, we're going to blow the lid off, we're going to go to the 
press, we're going to ruin him,' " Pellicano said. "That's a threat. I can't 
interpret that anyway but a threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Pellicano added that neither Rothman nor Gloria Allred, a prominent Los 
Angeles attorney who briefly represented the boy, filed a lawsuit, which 
Pellicano suggested was evidence that the conversations were not about settling 
a civil claim but were an extortion attempt. But the boy's current attorney, 
Larry R. Feldman, did file such a lawsuit last year and has pursued it 
aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement Monday comes as signs appear to point to an imminent 
resolution of that lawsuit. Sources say lawyers on both sides are in settlement 
talks and that while they have nearly reached agreement, they continue to 
discuss a few issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman would not take phone calls about the case Monday. His assistant would 
say only that he is expected to talk to the media today. Howard Weitzman and 
Johnnie Cochran Jr., Jackson's attorneys, also were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 After a court hearing Jan. 14, Superior Court Judge David Rothman announced 
that the attorneys had agreed to halt their public comments. Since then, they 
have declined to talk about the case, refusing to respond to a deluge of press 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources said Jackson will pay the boy at least $10 million in return for 
dropping the lawsuit. Estimates from people close to the negotiations range 
from about $15 million to about $24 million, with some of the money upfront and 
the rest in a trust fund for the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 If a settlement has been finalized by this afternoon, lawyers are expected to 
announce it at a news conference outside the Santa Monica courthouse, though 
sources say the attorneys will not disclose the agreement's terms. If no 
settlement is reached but discussions continue, the lawyers could announce a 
deal later this week, the sources added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the civil case is settled, that would not necessarily mean the end of 
Jackson's legal troubles. The Los Angeles Police Department and Santa Barbara 
County Sheriff's Department have been investigating the sexual abuse 
allegations raised by the boy since July, and prosecutors from both counties 
are weighing the possibility of bringing criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Settling the civil case would not affect their investigations unless the 
alleged victim stopped cooperating with authorities. Legal experts say that no 
such deal would likely be part of the formal civil settlement because it is 
illegal to obstruct an investigation or to "compound a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, if the boy and his family determined that it was in the child's 
best interests to put the case behind him now that the lawsuit was resolved, 
legal analysts predicted that it could doom the criminal investigation. Under 
California law, children can be forced to testify against their will, but the 
law does not allow authorities to punish victims of sex crimes who decline to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the announcement by the district attorney's office and the reports of 
an impending settlement in the civil case appeared almost simultaneously, 
prosecutors said that was a coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rejection would have been issued last week but for the earthquake," 
Montagna said. "There is no relation." 
</P>
<P>
 Pellicano -- who no longer works for Jackson but who still fiercely proclaims 
the entertainer's innocence and opposes any effort to settle the civil case -- 
scoffed at that and suggested that prosecutors and lawyers in the civil case 
are orchestrating an effort to dismiss all the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you believe that," he said of Montagna's comments, "I'll sell you some 
bayou land."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SERVICE FOR 'AN EVERYDAY HERO'; FUNERAL: 
MOURNERS REMEMBER VETERAN MOTORCYCLE OFFICER FOR HIS HUMOR AND ADVENTUROUS 
SPIRIT. HE PLUNGED TO HIS DEATH OFF A FREEWAY AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>

<P>
 Clarence Wayne Dean was not your typical cop, and he did not have a typical 
police officer's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 people showed up Monday from as far away as Arizona to honor 
and remember the veteran motorcycle officer who plummeted to his death off the 
Antelope Valley Freeway minutes after it broke apart in last week's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Rose Hills Cemetery in Whittier, there was the traditional ceremony for 
an officer who fell in the line of duty: a helicopter flyby, a gun salute and a 
riderless horse with the officer's boots facing backward in the stirrups. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the request of his family, to remember Dean's irreverence and 
individuality, his taste for adventure and his sense of humor, the service 
ended on an decidedly untraditional note.  
</P>
<P>
 As Mayor Richard Riordan, Police Chief Willie L. Williams and other 
dignitaries looked on, loudspeakers blared his favorite song, "Born to Be 
Wild." 
</P>
<P>
 The rock tune by the group Steppenwolf began, "Get your motor running/ head 
out on the highway/ looking for adventure in whatever comes our way." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was Dean, his friends said: a man crazy for adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 A divorced father of two, Dean, 46, had left his Lancaster home and was riding 
down the freeway within minutes of the powerful 4:31 a.m. quake, even though 
his shift did not start for more than two hours. He was killed when he rounded 
a bend on an Antelope Valley Freeway overpass, where it joins the southbound 
Golden State Freeway, and could not stop from plunging 30 feet off the severed 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 The gregarious cop with a surfer's blond hair was remembered fondly by his 
colleagues and family as a practical joker whose pranks could prompt laughter 
even from the motorists to whom he was issuing speeding tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "God put Wayne in our lives as a gift," said Sgt. Ron Moen, a police chaplain, 
"to bring laughter to a hurting world." 
</P>
<P>
 A story was told of the time Dean came to work after an injury wearing white 
tennis shoes. A sergeant ordered Dean to replace them with standard-issue black 
shoes, and so he went out shopping -- for a $2 can of black spray paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made himself the best pair of black shoes around," said Officer Bill 
Harkness, Dean's colleague in the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley 
Traffic Division and a friend for 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With 26 years on the force -- 10 of them as a motorcycle officer -- Dean was a 
caring man who often seemed to think more of the welfare of his friends and 
family than of his own, Harkness said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He could have come up with a million excuses why he couldn't go in to work 
that day," Harkness said. "But he got up, put on his uniform, and went in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider Clarence Wayne Dean a hero," Harkness said. "No, he's not a 
textbook hero. He was an everyday hero; the guy who made you feel good . . . 
who knew his obligation to his city." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Ronald W. Bergmann, who commands the Valley Traffic Division, said more 
than $2,000 has been raised for Dean's family, and Harkness and others urged 
those in attendance to give more. Dean is survived by a daughter, Tracy, 23, 
and a son, Guy, 25, who wants to become a police officer.

SUPERVISORS FACE HARSH BUDGET FACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With earthquake relief efforts well under way, members of the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors on Monday shifted their attention to a man-made 
disaster: their own budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In a special three-hour meeting that marked the beginning of fiscal 1994-95 
budget deliberations, county budget analysts told supervisors that they are 
already facing a $1-billion deficit that is largely of their own making. 
</P>
<P>
 County analysts reported that by borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars on 
a high-stakes gamble that the economy would pick up by this year, the Board of 
Supervisors went seriously into debt in the past two fiscal years and much of 
the bill is now coming due. Supervisors had borrowed money from various 
sources, including employee retirement funds, to fund continuing operations 
such as public health, welfare and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would encourage our re-examining our past practices," said County 
Auditor-Controller Al Sasaki. "I believe we need to consider more prudent 
fiscal practices in order to maintain our solvency." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Sasaki reported that in addition to its borrowing, the board has been 
ignoring mounting costs of workers' compensation, long-term disability, medical 
malpractice insurance and other liabilities that will have to be paid in the 
years to come. Sasaki pegged these unfunded liabilities at about $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 County Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed, hired several months ago 
largely on the strength of her ironfisted budgeting skills, recommended that 
the supervisors take a pledge to spend only money that they have in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 In unanimously adopting Reed's recommended five-point set of budget 
principals, the board agreed to follow the same well-accepted budgeting 
guidelines now in place in most businesses and households. 
</P>
<P>
 The principles agreed to are: Fund ongoing costs with ongoing revenues; fund 
one-time costs with one-time revenues; fund liabilities when they are first 
recognized; base the budget on realistic estimates, and establish a reserve for 
contingencies of about 2% of the budget, or about $26 million -- up from the 
currently budgeted $3 million.

MAN WHO TOOK GUN TO COURT WON'T BE PROSECUTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a five-week standoff with the U.S. attorney's office, a Los Angeles 
judge Monday reluctantly bowed to prosecutors' insistence that they had no case 
and dismissed charges against a 63-year-old man who carried a loaded .357 
magnum into a Downtown federal courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I don't agree (with the government's position), I think the court has 
gone far enough," said U.S. District Judge David W. Williams. "The case is 
dismissed." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' action paved the way for Vladimir Flint to be released from the 
Metropolitan Detention Center where he has been held since his arrest Oct. 4. 
Oswaldo Parada, a federal public defender who represents Flint, said he expects 
him to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge had refused since mid-December to dismiss the case, saying federal 
prosecutors did not take seriously enough the act of bringing a gun into a 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Alicia Amador said her office took the issue very 
seriously. But prosecutors maintained that Flint, a Lennox resident, had 
inadvertently brought the gun into the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building and 
thus lacked the criminal intent required in the statute under which he was 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was so outraged that he asked U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to bring in 
a special prosecutor from Washington to handle the case, but Reno did not grant 
the request. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Amador filed a motion reiterating the government's position that 
the case should be dismissed. The motion noted that the deadline for starting 
the trial under the federal Speedy Trial Law would expire Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 83, earlier had acknowledged that although he could refuse to 
dismiss the case, he could not force the U.S. attorney's office to bring it to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Flint was arrested after a federal marshal seized the gun he was carrying in a 
briefcase as he passed through a metal detector at the Roybal building. In 
mid-October he was ordered held without bail as a flight risk, and a date was 
set for his trial. 
</P>
<P>
 However, on Dec. 13, one day before the trial was to begin, Amador told 
Williams that the charge should be dismissed because after investigation, she 
and her superiors had concluded that Flint had not knowingly entered the 
courthouse with a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Amador said Flint's neighbor, who had brought him to the courthouse that day, 
told her that Flint usually slept with a gun because of fear of crime. The 
neighbor said Flint forgot to leave the gun at home, apparently because he had 
been rushing to get to court where he had a bankruptcy case pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams branded Amador's explanation "baloney." At a subsequent hearing, 
Williams again refused to dismiss the case, contending that the U.S. attorney's 
office had bungled the investigation. Terree A. Bowers, who was then U.S. 
attorney, supported Amador's decision to drop the case, as did his successor, 
Nora M. Manella, who took over Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Manella said that shortly after she became U.S. attorney she told Williams 
that the government would not bring the case to trial. In an interview, Manella 
said she was going to re-examine the issue of security at the two Downtown 
federal courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday's hearing, Amador said she was pleased that the case was 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took some heat for what we did, and I think that's unfortunate," she said. 
"We did everything in the interest of justice. We're not in the business of 
prosecuting innocent people, regardless of whether a jury would convict them."

LYLE MENENDEZ JURY DELIBERATING AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Returning to a still-closed Van Nuys courthouse, jurors in the Lyle Menendez 
murder trial resumed deliberations Monday after a break that stretched to 10 
days because of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 All 12 jurors, who live in the hard-hit San Fernando Valley, met behind closed 
doors in the morning with Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg, apparently 
telling him in an hourlong hearing that they could go on -- if the schedule 
included some flexibility for personal business in the wake of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge assented, sending the jury off to one of several undamaged trailers 
ringing the earthquake-damaged Superior Court building. The jurors went home 
about 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 They are scheduled back at the trailer today for a full day behind closed 
doors, a 24th day of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is no verdict today, the jury will take Wednesday off and come back 
to court Thursday. Beyond that, plans are not set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some jurors have earthquake-related problems," said Jerrianne Hayslett, a 
Superior Court spokeswoman, explaining the unusual schedule. The judge figured 
that it was better to be flexible than "shut down the entire jury," which would 
lead to a mistrial in the lengthy case. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, are charged with the Aug. 20, 1989, 
shootings of their wealthy parents, Jose Menendez, 45, and Kitty Menendez, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juries are hearing the case. Weisberg declared a mistrial in the Erik 
Menendez case Jan. 13 after that jury reported that it was hopelessly 
deadlocked. Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has vowed to retry Erik Menendez for 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lyle Menendez jury deliberated for a 22nd day on Jan. 14 without having 
sent any notes to the judge signaling a deadlock. Its last note, on Jan. 13, 
asked three questions on legal definitions relating to manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts have said the delay is unprecedented in such a high-profile 
trial and speculated that jurors might have trouble concentrating. But Weisberg 
clearly wants to give the panel every chance to reach a verdict following a 
costly trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lyle Menendez jury was due to be off Jan. 17 for the Martin Luther King 
Jr. holiday. But the earthquake that day caused major damage to the courthouse, 
knocking down ceiling tiles, paneling and one marble slab. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that the shaking might have released asbestos into the air, building 
inspectors tested for fibers and sealed the building. Court officials said they 
hoped that most of the seven-story building will reopen next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg, whose fourth-floor courtroom escaped with little damage, nonetheless 
was exiled to one of the outside trailers usually used as extra courtrooms, 
complete with an elevated judge's bench and spectator seats.

PERSONAL HEALTH; BRAIN CAN START MOUTH WATERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think about pizza. Thick, cheesy pizza. Think about the smell of pizza. Is 
your mouth watering yet? 
</P>
<P>
 When your mouth waters, you're creating saliva.Saliva helps you eat. Saliva is 
produced by saliva glands. These glands pump out saliva when food is in your 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes just seeing, smelling or thinking about a favorite food can put 
those glands into high gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Saliva glands get their orders from your brain, which signals your mouth to 
get ready for a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Saliva softens food, making it easier to chew and swallow. It also contains a 
chemical that helps break down food, so it can be more easily absorbed by the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 In between meals, saliva kills mouth germs that cause tooth decay. Your body 
makes about a quart and a half of saliva a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Whew!

WERE ONE-THIRD OF QUAKE VICTIMS SCARED TO DEATH?; HEALTH: A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF 
EARTHQUAKE-RELATED CARDIAC DEATHS DOES NOT SURPRISE MEDICAL EXPERTS WHO HAVE 
NEW RESPECT FOR THE POWER OF HUMAN EMOTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When the Northridge quake struck, the woman was terrified. In less than a 
minute, the shaking stopped and her Granada Hills house remained intact. But 
the danger, for the 73-year-old, had not passed. Her chest began to ache. She 
gasped for air. She knew she was in trouble and dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
 But 911 wasn't there. The telephone lines were down. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, the woman died in a manner similar to about 20 other Southern 
Californians following last week's 6.6 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 51 earthquake-related fatalities, early reports indicate that one-third 
may be due to heart attacks, or what doctors call sudden cardiac deaths. The 
Los Angeles County Coroner's official report is not expected for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the high percentage of cardiac deaths apparently related to the quake does 
not surprise medical experts who, in recent years, say they have developed an 
awesome respect for the power of emotions. In several of the cases, the victims 
were clearly reacting to immediate danger. 
</P>
<P>
 A 52-year-old Cypress woman died while racing through her creaking house to 
shepherd her children to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 A 62-year-old Northridge man was found dead in his car of an apparent heart 
attack. He managed to free himself from his buckling house and duck into his 
car. But he couldn't escape his fright. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven other people got to a hospital before their hearts finally gave out. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the heart-attack victims were 50 and older. But medical examiners have 
not ruled out heart attack as the cause of death for a 31-year-old Rancho 
Cucamonga woman who dashed to her baby's crib during the quake, stumbled and 
died, and an 11-year-old Westside girl who had been ill prior to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear, panic and terror are among the most gripping of sensations -- feelings 
strong enough that even young and healthy people often experience their hearts 
racing and breaths shortening in the midst of a traumatic event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I felt that way," says Dr. Linda Demer, chief of cardiology at UCLA 
Medical Center. This response, she says, is the well-known evolutionary trait 
called "fight or flight." It helps us react with some success when face-to-face 
with the saber-toothed tiger. 
</P>
<P>
 "This response involves massive releases of hormones (called catecholamines) 
which stimulate receptors in many places of the body, including the heart," 
Demer says. "That is responsible for the increased heart rate that most people 
feel. The heart beats faster and pumps harder. That increases the work load on 
the heart. The blood pressure goes up as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The response is designed to trigger an increase in strength in healthy 
individuals, Demer says. But, "if someone has compromised blood flow to the 
heart, they may not be able to meet the demands of the heart muscle." 
</P>
<P>
 And, it could be that the Northridge quake was poorly timed in relation to how 
much strain hearts can withstand. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this: Monday mornings are, statistically, the highest risk period for 
having heart attack. Early mornings are risky because of "normal biological 
variations, including the blood being more likely to clot in the morning 
hours," says Dr. Howard N. Allen, an attending cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mondays are thought to be risky because the weekend has ended and people 
face the mental stress of beginning a new work week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Research has shown that severe anxiety can be the trigger for a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies following moderate earthquakes in Thessaloniki, Greece (1978), and 
Newcastle, Australia (1989), provide "weak evidence that acute emotional and 
physical stress may trigger (heart attack) and coronary death," according to 
the authors of one of the studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Another study to determine if fear caused heart attacks was begun at a large 
Israeli hospital during the days before the Gulf War in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In that analysis, a dramatic jump in the number of heart attacks was observed 
on Jan. 17, 1991, the day after the start of the war, but before the first 
missile strikes in the area. Heart-attack rates were higher throughout the war, 
although the not as high as on that very first day. This suggests that the 
stress related to fear had a greater impact than the actual missile attacks, 
the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists even think they understand the chain of events that links the 
sensation of fear to a malfunctioning heart. But what they do not understand is 
why this sensation kills some people with heart disease and not others. And how 
can fear kill a person with no detectable heart disease -- for example, a 
seemingly robust, healthy person? 
</P>
<P>
 In people who already have some heart disease -- such as narrowed, clogged 
arteries -- catecholamines can cause an imbalance between the supply and demand 
of oxygen, causing a myocardial infarction, or heart attack, says Allen, a 
former president of the American Heart Assn.'s Greater Los Angeles Affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 Catecholamines can also accelerate the blood-clotting process. And, if there 
is already plaque, or fatty deposits, in the arteries, the clot may close off 
the artery and cause a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 But another type of attack is simply called "sudden death." And it is more 
mysterious in that -- in rare cases -- it can kill people who have no 
detectable heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 In sudden death, the catecholamines flooding the body trigger an onslaught of 
electrical impulses that can shift the heart's regular pace into a chaotic, 
rapid, irregular beat, called arrhythmia or tachycardia, says Allen. The heart 
is not really pumping anymore, but convulsing. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if an arrhythmia is triggered by anxiety or fear, "it's likely you have 
an underlying (heart) problem that would predispose you," says Dr. Barbara 
Natterson, a cardiology fellow at UCLA Medical Center who is also a 
psychiatrist. But that isn't always the case. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much remains to be learned about how stress affects the heart, experts admit. 
</P>
<P>
 Some research in the past decade suggests that men with hostile, hard-driving 
personalities -- the so-called "Type-A personalities" -- are more likely to 
have heart disease and subsequent heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, recent studies indicate that women who are poor at expressing 
their emotions are more likely to have heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have heart attacks tend to be those with the traditional risk 
factors, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, hypertension and family 
history," Natterson says. "But the question remains: What ultimately causes 
that plaque to rupture?" 
</P>
<P>
 Along with putting their patients on a treadmill, doctors now commonly test 
people with possible heart disease to see how they respond to mental or 
emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
 These tests include measuring the heart rate while the patient plays a 
challenging video game or completes a tough mental task.  
</P>
<P>
 But medical experts are far from being able to predict who might be more 
likely to have a heart attack while under stress. 
</P>
<P>
 A better question for Southern Californians -- especially those with heart 
disease -- might be: Do you get extremely frightened during an earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
 "The true meaning of stress is not only the stimulus -- the earthquake -- but 
how one has learned to respond," Allen says. "We are aware, in California, that 
this is an area where earthquakes occur. We talk about preparedness and what to 
do, but when it occurs, some people handle it an organized way and some people 
panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists often advise people to cope with an anxious situation by having 
a previously thought-out, well-rehearsed plan on what to do. Los Angeles 
psychologist Robert Butterworth, who has a long history of counseling trauma 
victims, says he wonders if some of those who died of heart attacks lacked a 
coping strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't wake those people up and ask them 'Did you have an alternative 
behavior?' Did you rehearse something?' " he says. "But if you have an 
alternative plan, you might think, 'If I do this, I'll survive.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the therapy behind disaster-response drills -- to learn to adapt, to 
get used to it. So when we are frightened, we are able to overcome it."

'WEETZIE BAT' PROVES SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE LACHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first words of Francesca Lia Block's "Weetzie Bat" could be a youth 
manifesto, the opening salvo blaring the Sturm und Drang of adolescence: 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason Weetzie Bat hated high school was because no one understood. They 
didn't even realize where they were living." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Block, 31, never set out to be a bard of puberty. Like other 
young-adult fiction authors, she woke up one morning to find herself 
metamorphosed into a standard-bearer for a genre she'd never thought much 
about. On the way, the L.A. writer became one of the most highly acclaimed 
stylists in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hardened critics, who thought they had seen all the possible variants of the 
coming-of-age novel, were astonished by the freshness of Francesca Lia Block's 
voice," Patty Campbell wrote in the New York Times. Michael Cart, writing in 
the Los Angeles Times, called her "one of the most original writers in the last 
10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Block followed the 1989 "Weetzie Bat" with three other tales borrowing the 
same quirky characters and beguiling pop-magic realism -- "Witch Baby," 
"Cherokee Bat and the Goat Guys," and "Missing Angel Juan." Most are set in an 
L.A. of "skating hamburgers" and "pink-flamingo skies" -- "hot and cool, glam 
and slam, rich and trashy, devils and angels." 
</P>
<P>
 "Weetzie Bat" traces the quasi-family formed by post-punk princess Weetzie; 
her love, My Secret Agent Lover Man; her best friend Dirk, and his boyfriend, 
Duck. For all its unconventional arrangements, the Weetzie books extol enduring 
values -- "the healing power of love," as Block puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Weetzie of "Weetzie Bat" fame was inspired by an actual "punk 
princess with spiky bleached hair" who was hitching in Laurel Canyon 14 years 
ago, uniformed for the trip in a "very pink '50s prom dress and cowboy boots," 
Block wrote in an essay for the L.A. Times two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Weetzie was born as Block was edging into adulthood in a dazzling but 
uncertain L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "While Los Angeles was full of fairy-tale magic and possibility for me, there 
was also a sense of encroaching darkness," wrote Block, who now straddles L.A. 
and Joshua Tree. "My friends and I found ourselves confronted with punks 
wearing swastikas as fashion statements. People were beaten at concerts. There 
was the personal pain I was experiencing due to my father's illness. And there 
were the first terrifying signs of the disease that would later be named AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote 'Weetzie Bat' as a celebration of the beauty and sparkle I had seen 
and as a way to deal with the suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 Block's lyrical work consistently wins American Library Assn. young adult book 
awards, and her fairy tale world of "jammin' cars" and "slammin' slinkster 
bands," evoking the passions and yearnings of youth, has won fans across the 
country.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Weetzie's straying from tradition has found foes among such librarians 
as New York's Barbara Nosanchuk, who lambasted "Weetzie Bat" as a 
"glorification of pathological neurotics" in a letter to the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Block thinks such criticism misses the point. And while her editors once 
considered -- and eventually decided against -- a disclaimer that they did not 
advocate the characters' freewheeling lifestyle, Block believes "parents should 
use their discretion and kids will use their judgment.

COMING OF AGE ON THE PRINTED PAGE; SOME GIVE YOUNG ADULT FICTION AN 'A' FOR THE 
FAMILIAR VOICE IT GIVES YOUNG PEOPLE. OTHERS FLUNK IT FOR 'DUMBING DOWN' 
LITERATURE.

 Paul Zindel never set out to make cultural history. So he was as surprised as 
anyone when he ended up a hero in the literary potboiler that became known as 
young adult fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 That chapter in Zindel's career opened in the mid-'60s, when his Pulitzer 
Prize-winning play, "The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-In-The-Moon Marigolds," 
was making a splash in theatrical circles. One of the zillions who saw it was 
Charlotte Zolotow, a legendary editor and author at Harper & Row. She saw 
beyond the play's portrait of a brutal mother and her two anguished daughters 
to a resonantly true voice that had only rarely been heard in fiction -- the 
Angst- filled adolescent. 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked me if I had any stories to tell for young people," says Zindel. 
"She saw that in my work before I was aware of it. I said, 'I do,' because I 
had been a chemistry teacher on Staten Island for 10 years and I'd kept notes 
on the kids, which should have told me I was interested in the kids, but I 
didn't know." 
</P>
<P>
 His faculty for student-speak materialized in his 1968 novel, "The Pigman," a 
cruelly realistic tale of friendship, betrayal and death told from the 
perspective of two high school outsiders. The book helped spawn a new literary 
genre -- young adult fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the turbulent '60s saw not only the emergence of the new brash voice 
of youth but also a literature to contain it -- and, when it was very, very 
good, to give it immortality. Seminal young adult novels such as S.E. Hinton's 
"The Outsiders" and Robert Cormier's "The Chocolate War" have joined "The 
Pigman" on middle-school reading lists nationwide. Educators hope to lure kids 
into the elusive reading habit with books that hold up a mirror to their own 
often fractured lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "What those books have in common are . . . someone feeling isolated, alone, 
misunderstood, separate, alien from authority, and that seemed to be the 
beginning of what became known as the world of young adult books," says Beverly 
Horowitz, editor in chief of Bantam, Doubleday, Dell Books for Young Readers 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Young-adult-paperback sales have soared over the years -- Time magazine 
reported a 300% jump in a two-year stretch in the early '80s -- partly because 
of the wild popularity of softcover series and teen horror novels (a relatively 
new subgenre that sprang up in the wake of Stephen King's huge teen following). 
But sales of hardcovers, primarily bought by schools and libraries, have 
declined, publishers say, partly because young adult fiction goes first when 
public-library budgets are slashed. As childhood seemingly gets shorter, so 
too, the age of the genre's audience has gradually dropped from high school to 
middle school and even younger. 
</P>
<P>
 While young adult fiction's essentially linear plots have come under fire from 
critics who complain they're simplistic, the same quality has captured the eye 
of Hollywood for its storytelling ease. The current monster hit "Mrs. 
Doubtfire" sprang from the young adult novel "Alias Madame Doubtfire" by Anne 
Fine, and other novels of the genre resulted in such critically esteemed films 
as "The Outsiders," featuring a younger Matt Dillon and Tom Cruise, and "Gas, 
Food, Lodging." 
</P>
<P>
 "The case for (young adult fiction) is that people want to read about 
themselves," says Roger Sutton, executive editor of the University of Illinois' 
Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Velasquez, 13, an eighth-grader at Southgate Middle School, says that's 
precisely why she reads teen fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adult books don't tell much about kids, so I just read teen-ager books," she 
says. "Sometimes they teach lessons of what we're going through during our teen 
years, like people making fun of you because of the way you are. It makes me 
feel that there are other people going through the same things I'm going 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Young adult fiction (YA, in the trade) came of age at a time when the divorce 
rate was spiking, when drugs and experimental sex were burrowing into a typical 
adolescence. And novels that gave that tumultuous reality an accurate voice 
have sometimes been controversial, drawing criticism from some educators, some 
religious groups and some parents. Censorship attempts have peppered the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave a presentation in Missouri and talked about the most exciting books in 
20 years," Sutton says. "A woman came up and was telling me, 'Thanks for 
telling me what not to buy in my library.' She'd get in trouble if she bought 
books about homosexuality or two kids smoking a joint and nothing happened.  
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Have you ever had trouble?' And she said, 'No, because I'm careful.' 
She's dug herself that pit." 
</P>
<P>
 Grown-ups had less to fret about in the decades before the genre's birth. With 
the rare exception of such feisty coming-of-age novels as "The Catcher in the 
Rye," by J.D. Salinger, and "Lord of the Flies," by William Golding, considered 
YA's spiritual forebears, typical teen novels were formulaic morality tales 
meant to control unruly youth. Novels by such '50s and early '60s authors as 
Rosamond du Jardin and Betty Cavanna sided with parents, who of course, always 
knew best. 
</P>
<P>
 Which was nothing like the lives adolescents were living by the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at 'The Pigman,' it's about two kids who befriend an old man (Mr. 
Pignati) and betray him," Sutton says. "That shows how little parents have to 
do with teen-age social interaction. The last person you'll confide in when 
you're 17 is your parent." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some earlier works were criticized for casting all adults as bad 
guys. Because YA fiction is not merely literature about youth and for youth, it 
has to have a certain raw, adolescent sensibility, the ambiguous teen's eye 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rise of youth culture created a power base for that perspective, the 
concurrent preeminence of TV created a life vacuum to accommodate it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Television was becoming the third parent, the only parent that militated 
against reading but also created a loneliness which softened up young people 
for reading," says award-winning YA author Richard Peck. "It's a warmer and 
more intimate relationship than television." 
</P>
<P>
 In his forthcoming examination of YA fiction, "Love and Death at the Mall: 
Teaching and Writing for the Literate Young," Peck writes: "We were to create a 
literature of family life for a generation who didn't have to be home on a 
school night, or had no home. It would be a literature of fathers for the 
fatherless, a literature to question girls who thought they had to demean their 
mothers in order to be women. A literature of the young looking everywhere for 
the stroking and structure of family." 
</P>
<P>
 Peck had an orchestra seat on adolescence as a middle- and high-school teacher 
in New York, a vocation that, not surprisingly, has sprouted many YA authors. 
He left his job in frustration in 1971 and tried his hand at fiction that would 
corral his former pupils' interest. The result was "Don't Look and It Won't 
Hurt," later filmed as "Gas, Food, Lodging." 
</P>
<P>
 Peck has continued to guide kids through the minefields of adolescence in his 
18 YA novels, taking an unflinching look at such issues as peer-group pressure, 
teen suicide and rape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an instructive agenda because I'm an old schoolteacher," Peck says. 
"I'm always thinking, 'What's my lesson?' My first message is 'Books can be 
about you' and that can be exciting for some kids, the idea that fiction is not 
reality with the names changed, but that fiction is this parallel reality in 
which you can learn something true about life. Because they don't know those 
things. They've read very little. I get letters from kids who say, 'Yours is 
the first novel I've ever read.' 
</P>
<P>
 "My other agenda you see in the background is the continual challenge of the 
power of the peer group, because it's even more mighty today. The peer group 
leader now has the power over you that parents used to. That should call for 
the whole literature questioning it. Are you going to be led by people no more 
mature than yourself? Will you let them tell you how to dress, how to appear, 
who to hate?" 
</P>
<P>
 The helping hand inherent in much of YA -- replacing the generational swat -- 
draws praise from admirers of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sincerely like YA books," says Elizabeth Devereaux, who reviews them for 
Publishers Weekly. "There's something about YA fiction that's different from 
adult fiction. Very often there's this generous impulse prompting it. You have 
an adult writer wanting to pass something on to younger people. I don't think 
sincerity is a literary virtue, but there's a generosity of spirit that I warm 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 But some critics complain that YA fiction goes too far in catering to its 
sometimes reluctant audience, that it oversimplifies prose and contemporary 
issues so much that kids learn the wrong lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something people want to talk about, the dumbing-down of 
literature," says Mary Warner Marien, a fine-arts professor at Syracuse 
University, who made that controversial case in the Christian Science Monitor. 
"You create intolerance for difficult language, and for difficulty itself. Some 
ideas are hard to understand -- you have to read them several times, but not 
these books. I read one waiting on line at the bank. They go like melting 
butter." 
</P>
<P>
 Author Bernie MacKinnon found that when one of his YA efforts was judged too 
challenging, it went unrewarded. His first novel, "The Mean Time," an 
exploration of racial friction that weighed in at 181 pages, was named to the 
American Library Assn.'s list of best books for young adults from 1966 to 1986. 
He spent 3 1/2 years on his second novel, "Song for a Shadow," more than 300 
pages of fiction about generational conflicts. But when the novel came before 
an ALA awards committee, its length knocked it out of the running. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone I hear had good things to say about it, but they thought it was too 
long," MacKinnon says. "I was given to understand that that's what tripped it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 MacKinnon agrees that YA authors feel some pressure to over-streamline issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a burden on adults to take a didactic role with the young," he says. 
"Even though we often don't know what the hell we're talking about, we want to 
be able to hand out unambiguous law. And in this, religion gets into the act, 
P.C. (political correctness) gets into the act . . . what's currently perceived 
as the healthiest, just ways of thinking that don't lend themselves to an 
ambiguous view of an essentially ambiguous world." 
</P>
<P>
 While its defenders acknowledge a broad spectrum of quality in YA, as in any 
genre, broad-brush criticism of its usefulness in literacy raises hackles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people paint (the state of youth literacy) as disastrous," says Dale 
Buboltz, a teacher-librarian at Southgate Middle School. "I don't think it's 
disastrous. Do I care if a kid is reading material off a computer screen? 
Doesn't bother me. Sears Roebuck catalogue? Doesn't bother me. Comic books? No. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of well-intentioned adults are excluding reading material when our real 
task should be to encourage reading of all kinds, because you can get to a 
point in this society where you do no reading, or very little reading. And 
that's where you have the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Some YA authors complain that many adults are so dismissive of the genre that 
it's unfairly tagged as "the B-team of literature," as author Chris Lynch put 
it in School Library Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music industry treats the 16-to-19-year-old group as an important, 
powerful consumer block," Lynch writes. "So does the fashion industry. So does 
the film industry. The publishing industry? There is enough skepticism about 
late-teen fiction that the store I frequent most in Boston does not stock a 
single hardcover title in the young adult section." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Zindel, one of the titans of the field, found himself dissed as a YA 
author during a BBC radio program. He recalls the interviewer asking him, " 
'One of these days, do you think you will write a proper book?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have called him on that. I said, 'I have written for adults, if 
that's what you mean.' " 
</P>
<P>
 HarperCollins editor Antonia Markiet believes that nose-thumbing attitude says 
more about the adults who adopt it than it does about the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a reflection of our society's view of children, which is a B-class 
human being, that they're stupid, that they're limited, that they don't 
understand, that they don't feel as strongly," she says. "It trickles down. Our 
attitude toward our kids affects what we do for kids. Movies are silly and 
trite. 
</P>
<P>
 "But (Patricia MacLachlan's) 'Sarah, Plain and Tall' is damn good. 'The 
Pigman' could be read by anybody. And Judy Blume. . . . They're wonderful, 
wonderful writers. Period." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more disturbing to YA proponents are censorship efforts on the local 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very serious issue for us right now," says publisher Horowitz. "I'm 
willing to let an author explore any subject as long as it's not to exploit or 
titillate." The genre's critics include such bulwarks of the right as Phyllis 
Schlafly, who encourages parents "to stand up for their rights" and have their 
schools ban YA novels. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are so badly written," Schlafly says. "I don't think children are helped 
by reading about depressing, unattractive, disagreeable people. There's nothing 
educational or inspirational or uplifting, and it's no wonder children are 
depressed. Anybody would be who reads that kind of thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I've never read any of these books. I consider myself well educated 
and don't consider them important enough to waste my time reading them." 
</P>
<P>
 Peck had to cross police barriers to speak at a Decatur, Ill., school he 
attended as a child after Schlafly's supporters targeted his book "The Ghost 
Belonged to Me." The novel -- about a relationship that straddles generations, 
as an adolescent listens to his uncle's ghost stories -- was criticized for 
supposedly encouraging participation in the occult. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're a writer for young people, you realize how terrified parents are 
and some act inappropriately," Peck says. "They realize their kids are out of 
control and some look for scapegoats and find them in books. It's easier to 
attack fellow adults. It's easier to threaten a librarian than it is to 
challenge their own child's authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Buboltz, who objects to book banning, says Southgate Middle School's official 
procedure for entertaining complaints deters most aspiring censors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hand them a two-page form to fill out," he says. "The first question is, 
did they read the book? Usually they take the form with them and go because 
they haven't read the book. They seldom return." 
</P>
<P>
 One parent who did return tried to get a Time-Life book on extra-sensory 
perception banned because, she said, it promoted devil worship. The school 
denied the request. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what that mother did was she created so much interest in that Time-Life 
book that it wasn't two months before the book was totally worn out," Buboltz 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 There have more subtle attempts as well. Buboltz noticed that one book that 
kept disappearing off the shelves was "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," a 
YA progenitor that's on the ALA's list of 15 most-censored teen books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had three copies when I first came to this library 11 years ago," Buboltz 
says. "I noticed the copies were gone. I got a couple more and put them on the 
shelf, and one of my library-practice students said a teacher had taken it. I 
went to the teacher files, and no teacher had checked it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The teachers) had taken it. The objection was the use of the word 'nigger'. 
To make sure it wasn't used by students, they solved it by self-censoring." 
</P>
<P>
 Some authors fear that principle will be taken to its contemporary conclusion, 
that censors, hoping to shield kids from the unpleasantries of the real world, 
will sterilize the fictional one. Author Lynch wrote about his concerns when a 
mother complained about salty pubescent language in his novel "Shadow Boxer": 
</P>
<P>
 "As the father of a linguistically nimble 3 1/2-year-old, I don't like every 
single word either. . . . Even the offending parties themselves, the 11-, 12-, 
13-year-old boys, don't pop off in conversation with their parents or other 
respected elders. . . . Where they 'take the gloves off' is when they are 
alone, or with peers, or with rougher-edged adults. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "My plea is authenticity. . . . My job is to look at the thing and tell it. I 
am sorry if parents are displeased to hear about what goes on out of their 
earshot. I know I am not looking forward to someday hearing my daughter speak 
in purple, only to follow it up with, 'Well, you wrote it, Dad.' But I feel I 
have an obligation beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
 That obligation is to create a parallel world that is inviting, not because it 
is utopian, not because it is protected, but because it is truly wrought. And 
Peck says it has never been more pressing to help children choose reading, 
especially YA fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are novels that will give them some guidelines in survival, because 
we're losing too many young people now, to suicide, to murder, to drunk 
driving, to drugs," he says. "These are books that encourage life, not death."

 BIG BLIMP: In the shadow of one of Tustin's historic blimp hangars, county 
officials envision an "urban park" with meandering paths for biking and 
jogging. . . . The park is part of the county's application to the federal 
government for converting the soon-to-close Marine Corps Air Station at Tustin, 
but one question remains: what to do with the huge hangar? "The blimp hangar 
has complicated the planning process," says the county's proposal.

 BACK ON TRACK: Fast-food pioneer Carl Karcher talks to University of Southern 
California business school alums on the "Entrepreneurial Spirit" today at the 
Irvine Marriott hotel.The appearance marks his first talk since battles with 
the board of Carl Karcher Enterprises forced him to cancel several speeches and 
a radio show last year. . . . "He's just going to talk about the trials and 
tribulations of being an entrepreneur in today's world," said USC's Bob Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 BIG TENT: Representatives of Taco Bell are at the Newport Beach Country Club 
parking lot today constructing a 46,200-square-foot tent to seat 1,500 people. 
. . . The canvas monstrosity will be the site of Friday's "Hog Wild For Hoag 
Hospital," a gala fund-raising event for the hospital featuring a 
Harley-Davidson biker bar motif, dinner by five chefs and a performance by rock 
and roll star Huey Lewis (above) & The News. Cost is $200 per person, "but 
there's complimentary valet parking," a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 MEDICAL HELP: Last week's earthquake was the first opportunity to test a new 
law, drafted after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, that allows physician assistants 
to render minimally supervised emergency care during such disasters. . . . A 
spokeswoman for the Anaheim-based California Academy of Physician Assistants 
said it's too early to tell how many members assisted, but "I would be 
surprised if it wasn't in the hundreds."

 LINK TO FUTURE: The good news is that Metrolink service from Antelope Valley 
to Los Angeles began Monday, offering a refuge from the overcrowded freeways. . 
. . The bad news is that the trip took almost 2 1/2 hours. The service may 
become permanent a decade earlier than anyone expected (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 CARDIAC DEATHS: Of the 57 earthquake-related fatalities, one-third are 
believed to have resulted from heart attacks, which doesn't surprise medical 
experts. . . . During a traumatic event like a quake, "the heart beats faster 
and pumps harder," said Dr. Linda Demer, chief of cardiology at UCLA Medical 
Center. "That increases the workload on the heart." (E1). 
</P>
<P>
 MAGIC AIRLIFT: Magic Mountain, normally reserved as an escape for those 
seeking daring thrills and chills, has been pressed into real-life duty as a 
landing zone for hundreds of deputies and firefighters who can't afford to 
waste time on the overcrowded routes between Los Angeles and Santa Clarita. . . 
. Helicopters, such as the one above, arrive each day for a shift change of 
emergency personnel. (B2). 
</P>
<P>
 DOUBLE WHAMMY: The quake will cost the insurance industry at least $1.5 
billion in property claims, though it could have been much worse. Most 
homeowners played the odds and passed up expensive quake coverage. Many 
insurers, however, such as 20th Century Insurance in Woodland Hills, suffered 
extensive damage to their structures . . . Meanwhile, financial institutions 
are offering programs to assist consumers who had major losses. See Valley 
Business, Pages 3, 5. 
</P>
<P>
 NO GAMES: Another casualty of the quake has been high school sports, and there 
is no relief in sight. The City Section has postponed all athletic events for 
the second week in a row, and might be forced to cancel the rest of the winter 
season. Altogether, 24 of the City's 49 schools were affected by the temblor 
(C7).

 NORMAL TIMES: Ventura County is getting back to normal after last week's 
earthquake (B1), and so is The Times' Ventura County Edition. Newswatch is 
back, the Ventura County Focus pages are back (B2-3), and the front of Section 
B is again devoted to your part of Ventura County. . . . Businesses in hard-hit 
Simi Valley may be affected for months (Valley Business, Page 11). . . . Bright 
side: "Tragic as the earthquake was," Cal Lutheran economist Jamshid Damooei 
said, "it could mark the beginning of a long-term business improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 SOCCER BOOST: Oxnard College is by far the smallest of Ventura County's three 
community colleges. But it will take a big leap in prestige this week with the 
expected announcement of its selection as training site for Cameroon's World 
Cup soccer team. . . . "To say we are excited is an understatement," said 
college spokeswoman Barbara Gilmore. . . . The west African nation will send 35 
players, trainers and coaches. . . . In 1990, Cameroon shocked defending champs 
Argentina and then Colombia, but lost to England in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 ON TRIAL: It has been 20 months since he was arrested in Hollywood, his car 
allegedly littered with $10,000 in small bills and traces of cocaine. Now 
opening statements have begun in Father David Piroli's trial (B1). . . . Piroli 
is accused of stealing $60,000 from churches in Simi Valley and Saticoy, but a 
few parishioners believe in him so strongly that they have put up his bail. 
</P>
<P>
 CHANGING CHANNELS: Ojai's Scott Bakula starred for 4 1/2 seasons on NBC's 
"Quantum Leap," then became a recurring character on CBS's "Murphy Brown." Soon 
he'll pop up on ABC in "State of Terror," a movie being filmed in Vancouver. . 
. . Sounds like a docudrama on the earthquake, but it's a thriller about a 
woman who learns the mob is out to kill her. . . . Speaking of network-hopping, 
John Madden will definitely be broadcasting Fox's NFL games next season (C4). . 
. . Madden's paycheck: $365,000 per game.

SAFE BICYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It makes good sense to wear a helmet while bicycling, as you pointed out 
(editorial, Jan. 15). It is especially important in the Los Angeles area, where 
bicycling is inherently dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 When in Amsterdam recently, I was surprised to see no helmets at all, in a 
city where bicycles are everywhere. Yet they have a much better safety record 
than we do. How can this be? They have a better record because they have strong 
programs to provide safe pathways in order to prevent bicycle-car crashes, 
rather than focus on what will happen to cyclists when they get hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Without letting up on the campaign to protect cyclists' heads, we need to give 
more attention to making Los Angeles a safe place to ride bikes. It will be 
safe only when we make sure that the bicycle rider is treated as the equal of 
the car driver.

MALATHION SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The State Department of Agriculture's decision to blanket the city of Corona 
with malathion eight to 10 times shows a callous disregard for public safety 
(Jan. 14). 
</P>
<P>
 This is a procedure that has proven to be both ineffective in eliminating the 
Medfly and extremely dangerous to all living things. 
</P>
<P>
 Speak to people in areas where the spraying has been done and you will find 
that the poison kills indiscriminately. Don't count on hearing any crickets 
chirp in the city after the applications. 
</P>
<P>
 The spraying is harmful to anyone and anything that happens to be outdoors or 
breathing air from (where else?) the outdoors or eating anything that happens 
to be exposed to the spray. Family pets, livestock and even fish in fish ponds 
or streams are affected and often killed by the spraying. Oh yeah, and for 
those out there that don't have a garage, the spray eats the paint off your 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the pilots doing the spraying are forced to make a field judgment on 
whether the wind conditions might blow the spray into other areas. The city of 
Norco, with its cattle and agriculture, could also be severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Corona 
</P>
<P>
 * The statement issued by the Malathion Public Health Effects Advisory 
Committee that "concerns about eye disease were found to be unwarranted, and 
pesticide poisoning and other serious effects did not occur" is, quite simply, 
incorrect. Documented cases of pesticide poisoning did occur -- I am one of 
them, as I have stated many times, and I am aware of dozens of other seriously 
affected citizens. As for eye damage, we all know the case of a young boy 
blinded as a result of the 1989-90 spraying, and I, and many others, are now 
forced to wear glasses at all times, when we never had to before our exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that the governor's office and the state health department officials 
feel that if they repeat a falsehood often enough it will make it true. It 
doesn't.

KINGS MAKE THEIR POINT IN THE END; HOCKEY: KURRI SCORES WITH THREE SECONDS TO 
PLAY TO TIE FLAMES, 3-3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one would have been surprised if Wayne Gretzky had been a bit distracted 
here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 There was really nothing special about Game No. 46 on the Kings' schedule -- 
that is, until they played the game. In the last week, Gretzky's house was 
virtually ruined and, in St. Louis, his mother-in-law was seriously injured. 
But for at least one night, Gretzky escaped from his off-ice troubles with some 
help from his favorite linemate, Jari Kurri. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky and Kurri displayed some of their on-ice magic in the Kings' 3-3 tie 
against the Calgary Flames at the America West Arena before a crowd of 14,684. 
Kurri had the big goal of the game with 3.5 seconds remaining in regulation, 
slapping a one-timer off a cross-ice pass from Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 All three King goals were on the power play and Gretzky had a hand in all 
three, scoring once and adding two assists. Kurri's goal came with the Kings 
holding a five-on-three advantage with goaltender Kelly Hrudey pulled for an 
extra attacker and Flame defenseman Chris Dahlquist off for cross-checking Luc 
Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have much time to get rid of the puck," Kurri said. "I got rid of it 
as fast I could. We wanted to win the faceoff, try to get the puck to Wayne. 
When you have a guy like him passing you the puck, that makes it easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Hrudey had a closer look than usual at the Gretzky-Kurri combination and could 
only shake his head in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gretz and Jari were so good it was ridiculous," said Hrudey, who faced 42 
shots. "I continue to shake my head sometime." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Hrudey ticked off the things that Gretzky has been through in the last 
week -- the destruction of his home, the serious injury to his mother-in-law, 
the crazy travel schedule and no real break because of the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
 "A game like that -- he doesn't get paid enough money," Hrudey said. "Night in 
and night out, he never denies. He has nothing to prove and he continues to 
prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings (18-23-5) had lost consecutive games before Monday night and wanted 
to start the post All-Star break on a good note. With the three-point night, 
Gretzky widened his lead in the NHL's scoring race, moving eight points ahead 
of Detroit's Sergei Fedorov, 85-77. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I've said many times before, without question Jari is the best one-timer 
to ever play the game," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kurri, it was one of those nights he would not give up. With 14.6 seconds 
remaining, his slap shot hit the crossbar and popped out. His teammates and the 
crowd -- with a heavy King loyalty -- thought the goal was in. It was reviewed 
and ruled no goal. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it went for the Kings. In overtime, it appeared as though they 
won it when Tony Granato circled behind the net, came out to the side and put 
it past Flame goaltender Andrei Trefilov with 3:56 remaining, but referee Bob 
Shick blew the whistle because the net was dislodged. King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 First, the earthquake rendered Wayne Gretzky's home in Beverly Hills 
uninhabitable when he was in Philadelphia a week ago. His wife Janet Jones and 
his children and mother-in-law, Jean, then packed up and went back to St. 
Louis, which is where Jones grew up. In St. Louis, Jean was hit by a car, 
landed in a ditch and suffered a broken collarbone and needed a second skin 
graft for her leg on Monday. So far, there has been no infection, but Gretzky 
said if it happens, she may lose the leg. "It's hard because her mom is a young 
74," Gretzky said. "She's kind of our nanny." Gretzky spent Sunday in St. Louis 
before joining the team here. He might have to live in a hotel when he returns 
to Los Angeles. The Gretzkys did have earthquake insurance. "The deductible is 
so high, we're talking about a lot of money," he said. "You're almost hoping 
the house has to come down." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' practice facility, Iceoplex, in North Hills -- owned in part by Luc 
Robitaille and former Steve Duchesne -- suffered damage as well and the team 
will be practicing at Culver City the rest of the week. Due to the power loss, 
Iceoplex lost its ice and several tiles from the roof shook loose.

BLUES BRING DOWN DUCKS IN OVERTIME, 3-2; HOCKEY: HULL SCORES ONCE AND SETS UP 
TWO OTHER GOALS FOR ST. LOUIS. DUCHESNE RETURNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Coming off the All-Star break, most of the players on the Mighty Ducks and St. 
Louis Blues were fresh Monday night, when the Blues took a 3-2 overtime victory 
before a sellout crowd of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Hull, who played in the All-Star game at Madison Square Garden on 
Saturday, wasn't so fresh, but it didn't matter. He scored the Blues' first 
goal, then set up the tying goal and Kevin Miller's winner at 1:10 of the 
five-minute extra period. 
</P>
<P>
 There were a lot of rested players on the ice, but none was more rested than 
St. Louis defenseman Steve Duchesne. 
</P>
<P>
 He hadn't played since April 28, a break of nearly nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Monday morning, Duchesne hadn't even skated since last week's 
earthquake, because the Iceoplex, the North Hills rink he co-owns with the 
Kings' Luc Robitaille, was damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Duchesne, a former King and an Encino resident, had refused to report to the 
Quebec Nordiques all season after a salary dispute and bitter arbitration 
hearing and was traded to the Blues in a five-player deal Sunday. He hadn't 
played since April 28, when the Nordiques lost to Montreal in six games in a 
first-round playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the trade, Duchesne was rumored to be headed several places, even on 
the final day of talks; and Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira said he had 
talked with Quebec General Manager Pierre Page about a deal but didn't believe 
he was close to acquiring Duchesne. 
</P>
<P>
 No one expected Duchesne to play Monday night, but the Blues were a bit 
shorthanded and Duchesne was eager. But the transition wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt so slow," Duchesne said. "I wanted to take a shot, and all of a sudden 
there'd be a stick there." 
</P>
<P>
 Duchesne, 28, who had 82 points last season for the Nordiques, started the 
game and played on both the power play and penalty-killing units, trying five 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is apparently going to take a while for the Blues to adjust to 
losing defenseman Garth Butcher and forwards Ron Sutter and Bob Bassen in the 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "They traded the heart and soul of the team out," Hull said. "We just lost 
three really close friends. Steve coming in played really great for us. He's so 
talented offensively and he moves the puck well. For a guy who hasn't played 
(this season), he played great." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Duchesne: "It feels a little awkward, coming in the locker room. I know 
those guys were liked by everybody. Sure, it will take a few games, a few 
weeks, to adjust and be accepted. I understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blues managed to win despite the wandering ways of their all-star goalie, 
Curtis Joseph. Both Duck goals -- by Troy Loney and Tim Sweeney -- were scored 
after he wandered far out of the crease. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks led, 2-1, after two periods, but Joseph kept it tight, and beat his 
former backup, the Ducks' Guy Hebert, for the first time in three tries this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blues made the score 2-2 at 1:54 of the third period when Hull carried the 
puck in on a two-on-two rush, then sent it across the slot to center Jim 
Montgomery, who had beaten defenseman Don McSween down the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Duchesne was happy to have his debut victorious -- and behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never ridden my bike so much in my life," he said of his layoff. "I know 
I wouldn't be able to retire right now. It was just eating me away. Every time 
I watched a game on TV, the Kings or something, I was going nuts. I wanted to 
be there." Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Goaltender Ron Tugnutt's wife, Lisa, gave birth Sunday to the couple's first 
child, Jacob Ronald Alfred.

NHL ROUNDUP; BURE'S THIRD GOAL IS A WINNER FOR CANUCKS IN OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pavel Bure scored his third goal of the game 54 seconds into overtime to give 
the Vancouver Canucks a 5-4 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Monday night at 
Saskatoon, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Bure blasted a slap shot from the faceoff circle past Edmonton goaltender Bill 
Ranford to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The game began awkwardly for the Canucks, who lost the services of center 
Jimmy Carson because of a coaching blunder by Pat Quinn. On his lineup sheet, 
Quinn wrote the name Dixon Ward, instead of Carson's, beside the No. 17. Ward 
was traded to the Kings for Carson on Jan. 8. Because he was not listed on the 
lineup sheet, Carson had to leave the Canucks' bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Gelinas and Trevor Linden also scored for the Canucks. Jason Arnott 
scored twice, and Bob Beers and Zdeno Ciger had one each for the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice the Oilers came back from two-goal deficits. Vancouver jumped out to a 
2-0 first-period lead on goals by Linden and Bure. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciger and Arnott lifted the Oilers back into a tie in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Bure and Gelinas moved Vancouver back into the lead with goals early in the 
third period, but Arnott and Beers pulled the Oilers even with two goals in the 
final five minutes of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 8, Montreal 3 -- The expansion Panthers scored three goals in a span 
of 1:49 in the second period at Miami in improving their record against the 
defending Stanley Cup champions to 3-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida won its franchise-best fourth in a row and extended its unbeaten 
streak to six games. Its eight goals was also a franchise record. The Panthers 
(20-17-8) scored six in a one-goal victory over the Kings on Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida scored five goals on seven shots during its second-period barrage, 
another club mark. Scott Mellanby led the offense with two goals and an assist. 
Andrei Lomakin also scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay 4, Buffalo 0 -- Danton Cole scored two goals and Daren Puppa made 23 
saves at Orlando, Fla., for his third shutout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 2, Hartford 1 -- Adam Oates had a goal and an assist to lead the Bruins 
at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Cam Neely also scored as the Bruins extended the Whalers' winless streak to 
six games. 
</P>

MORNING BRIEFING: RUNNING AN ERRAND FOR BONDS MAKES FORMER MVP SAY 'HEY!'

 Willie Mays went to a dinner in New York on Sunday to receive Barry Bonds' 
National League most valuable player award and criticized his godson for not 
showing up himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave him $47 million," said Mays, a special assistant to San Francisco 
Giant President Peter Magowan. "For that, he ought to pick up his (own) award." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds won the NL MVP for the third time in four seasons. Mays is a two-time 
MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you win an award, you (should) have to pick it up," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Mays: Mays also said he told Bonds not to compare himself with his 
godfather quite yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played 20 years," Mays said he told him. "Then you can talk about it."

 Tough league: Manager Johnny Oates of the Baltimore Orioles says the only 
thing he knows about realignment is that a good team is going to finish last in 
the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, if you'd asked me five days ago, I couldn't even have 
told you which teams are in our division," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FYI Johnny: The teams are Baltimore, Boston, Detroit, Toronto and the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Remember Perez: Orlando Cepeda received a lot of sympathy when he barely 
failed to make baseball's Hall of Fame in the recent voting. But how about Tony 
Perez, the Cincinnati first baseman who was overshadowed by Big Red Machine 
teammates Johnny Bench, Pete Rose and Joe Morgan? 
</P>
<P>
 Perez had more hits than Ted Williams and more runs batted in than Mike 
Schmidt.

</P>
<P>
 Good excuse: High school track athletes usually must post impressive marks to 
be invited to invitational indoor meets such as next month's Sunkist scheduled 
for the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 When Riverside Poly Coach Shane Wiley requested a spot for shotputter Smitty 
Diecks, he had no good mark, but Wiley had a novel reason. Diecks was hit by a 
shot in training, which is why his coach said he didn't reach his potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Al Franken of the Sunkist says he's in.

 Fast Freddie: Defenseman Al Iafrate of the Washington Capitals retained his 
title as the hardest shooter in the NHL in All-Star game skills competition. 
Iafrate topped the NHL All-Stars at 102.7 m.p.h., the only player to break 100 
m.p.h.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In boxing, the title rematch is rarely as good as the original. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But I am going out on a limb and predicting that the first Super Bowl rematch 
will be more exciting than the game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Buffalo 
Bills last January. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Before the inception of the Super Bowl, there were eight NFL and two AFL 
championship game rematches. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Decisions were reversed five of the 10 times. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 One of them was the 1951 NFL title game won by the Rams over the Cleveland 
Browns, 24-17, at the Coliseum. Each Ram was paid $2,108 after receiving $686 
for a 30-28 loss the previous year at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders should note that the winning teams Sunday were penalized a total 
of 29 yards. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Am I the only one who thought Joe Montana got hit late on the play that 
knocked him out of the game? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Key statistic: Emmitt Smith had more receiving yardage than Jerry Rice on 
Sunday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Instant-replay review advocates got more ammunition when the NBC tape 
indicated that the ball hit the ground on what was ruled a Dave Krieg-to-J.J. 
Birden completion to the two-yard line that set up Kansas City's only 
touchdown. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan will become the first defensive coordinator ever to be a guest on 
"The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" on Wednesday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Robert Fiske, who has been appointed special counsel for the Whitewater 
investigation, represented the NFL in its case against the USFL in 1986. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders might be interested in Barry Word, the running back who will not 
be re-signed by the Minnesota Vikings. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis Blues got high-scoring former King defenseman Steve Duchesne 
from the Quebec Nordiques cheaply enough. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to Riddick Bowe for paying $360,000 to 3,600 people in Washington, 
D.C., who turned in their guns. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez is training at Campo for his rematch with Michael 
Carbajal on Feb. 19 at the Forum.I presume that Gonzalez and another Campo 
regular, Terry Norris, are working hard to improve the durability of their 
chins. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Another title bout at the Forum -- one of three shows there in 19 days -- will 
match World Boxing Assn. junior lightweight champion Genaro Hernandez against 
Cocas Ramirez on Monday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Best fight on the MGM Grand card Saturday night in Las Vegas could be Simon 
Brown against Troy Waters. Brown knocked out Norris -- and Waters knocked 
Norris down. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Each of the four leading jockeys in the Santa Anita standings probably will be 
on suspension this week. Co-leader Kent Desormeaux and third-place Chris Antley 
will begin their five-day suspensions on Wednesday and fourth-place Chris 
McCarron will begin his on Thursday. Co-leader Alex Solis probably will be set 
down beginning Friday after being disqualified in the third race Sunday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Telly Savalas, who died Saturday at 70, was co-owner of Telly's Pop, the 
winner of the California Derby and fifth-place finisher in the Santa Anita 
Derby in 1976. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 You could come up with a pretty good basketball team of NBA television and 
radio analysts -- Bill Walton at center, Tom Heinsohn and Walter Davis at 
forwards, and Bob Cousy and Walt Frazier at guards. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The San Antonio Spurs, who need a point guard to become a strong contender, 
should trade with the Orlando Magic for Scott Skiles. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 One of the better guards in college basketball is B.J. Tyler of Texas, who 
spent time at John Lucas' drug rehab center in Houston. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Mavericks have seven picks in the next two NBA drafts. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It's not too early for college basketball fans to circle Dec. 4 on their 
calendars -- UCLA vs. Kentucky and Kansas vs. Massachusetts at the Anaheim 
Arena. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The last time Kentucky played UCLA, the Bruins won, 92-85, in the 1975 NCAA 
championship game at San Diego. It was John Wooden's final game as coach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Mike Warren, a consensus All-American guard at UCLA in 1968, called to 
say that he was flattered by the comparison of him to Tyus Edney. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Edney is better than I ever was," Warren said. "Remember, I had the big man 
(Lew Alcindor) and could afford to make mistakes. I was quick, but Edney is 
also fast. He's a blur. He's a born leader and a lot more demonstrative this 
season." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, who are generous to most veteran players, should not penny-pinch 
Mike Piazza simply because he is a sophomore.

<P>
 Orange, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball / Guard 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales led Orange County with 92 three-point baskets last season. Although 
that pace has slowed, Orange coaches are happier with Gonzales' play because of 
his improved defense, rebounding, passing and shooting percentage. Friday, 
against then-No. 3 Santa Ana Valley, Gonzales had 22 points, including five 
three-pointers, and a season-high 12 rebounds as the Panthers won, 64-58, and 
moved into sole possession of first place in the Century League. Wednesday, 
Gonzales had 15 points and seven rebounds in a 61-56 victory over El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 Other notables: 
</P>
<P>
 * Greg Abbott, Troy, who averaged 22 points in Freeway League victories over 
Sunny Hills and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jason Fikse, Esperanza, posted his third and fourth consecutive Empire 
League shutouts, a 0-0 tie with Los Alamitos and 2-0 over Loara. 
</P>
<P>
 * Judd Nester, Capistrano Valley, scored two goals in a 4-0 soccer victory 
over Dana Hills and one in a 3-0 victory over then-No. 1 Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ali Ton, Los Alamitos, had 24 points and 11 assists in a 77-59 victory over 
Katella and seven points and 10 assists in a 69-41 victory over Esperanza.

PREP NOTES: ORANGE HIGH'S MARTINEZ TO RUN AT AZUSA PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ROHWER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jaime Martinez, standout cross-country runner from Orange High School, has 
made an oral commitment to Azusa Pacific, Orange Coach Ed Cantu said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, The Times Orange County runner of the year, received offers from 
more than 20 colleges, including Notre Dame.But Martinez wanted to stay close 
to home, Cantu said, deciding on Azusa Pacific after visiting the campus. Azusa 
Pacific, an NAIA university, is giving Martinez a five-year scholarship to help 
ensure his graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Azusa Pacific has a good program, especially in the middle and long 
distances," Cantu said. "They've competed against and defeated a lot of 
Division I schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez qualified for his second consecutive Foot Locker Nationals this 
season (finishing 12th). This spring he will run track for Orange, where he was 
the Southern Section Division II mile champion as a junior. BOB ROHWER

TENNIS / AUSTRALIAN OPEN; GRAF TOO TOUGH FOR DAVENPORT IN QUARTERFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Top-seeded Steffi Graf won a duel between two of the hardest hitters in 
women's tennis, defeating Lindsay Davenport, 6-3, 6-2, Tuesday to reach the 
semifinals of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, who has not lost a set in the tournament, used a booming forehand and 
repeatedly sent passing shots beyond the reach of the 17-year-old from 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport, 6 feet 2 and 165 pounds, was seeded No. 16 and playing in her first 
Grand Slam quarterfinal. She often froze Graf with blistering forehands and 
sharply angled two-handed backhands, but she was too slow to give Graf much 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport got an early service break to go up 3-1 in the first set. But the 
German won the next five games to win the set and was in command throughout the 
second set. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf's next opponent will be No. 10 Kimiko Date, who became the second 
Japanese woman to advance to a Grand Slam semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheered by fans with red and white Japanese flags painted on their faces, Date 
turned back a third-set rally by third-seeded Conchita Martinez to reach the 
semifinals. Date won, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, taking advantage of repeated backhand 
errors by Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Date took a 4-0 lead in the final set, then lost three straight games. But 
Martinez lost her touch again, missing several easy shots while dropping the 
last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Date was backed by supporters holding signs in Japanese and one in English 
saying, "You Can Do It!" Some fans bowed to her after the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario also won, reaching the semifinals of this event for 
the fourth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario ended the Grand Slam career of Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere with 
a 7-6 (7-3), 6-4 victory. Maleeva-Fragniere is retiring next month after a 
13-year pro career. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-seeded Sanchez Vicario played erratically, losing her last two 
service games, but No. 8 Maleeva-Fragniere made even more mistakes -- hitting 
several easy overheads into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario will face No. 4 Gabriela Sabatini or No. 5 Jana Novotna in the 
semifinals. Sabatini woke up feeling ill and it was unclear whether she would 
be able to face Novotna. 
</P>
<P>
 The men finished their fourth-round matches Monday. Ninth-seeded Todd Martin 
kept cool in the 102-degree afternoon heat, and Mal Washington warmed up in the 
cool evening air. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, covering his head and legs with iced towels during changeovers, 
defeated Xavier Daufresne of Belgium, 6-7 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-3, in a 
match that lasted 3 hours 24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington reached his first Grand Slam quarterfinal by outlasting Mats 
Wilander in five error-filled sets. He overcame early sloppiness and rallied to 
win, 6-7 (9-7), 6-2, 6-7 (7-3), 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 When the four-hour match ended, the temperature had dropped to 66 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were out there in the heat, there's no way we could have gone five 
sets. Someone would have keeled over," Washington said. "If it was in the heat, 
one of us would have died in the third or fourth set."

 Nicole Erickson's free throws to open the second half of Brea-Olinda's 65-49 
victory over Mater Dei on Saturday gave her the school's career-scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson surpassed Aimee McDaniel, who scored 1,797 points from 1987-90, with 
her 10th point of the night. She finished with 20 points, giving her 1,808 with 
six regular-season games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 If she maintains her 16-point average, her projected 2,032 points would place 
her 10th on the Southern Section all-time career scoring list. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, she downplayed the record. "It's nice," she said, "but what 
I'm looking for won't be until March." 
</P>
<P>
 The State finals are March 19. MARTIN HENDERSON

 Grant Pearsall of Villa Park, one of the most highly recruited defensive backs 
in the county, said he has made an oral commitment to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearsall, a 6-foot-1, 190-pound senior, chose the Trojans over Arizona State, 
Oregon and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough decision," Pearsall said. "(USC Coach) John Robinson has won a 
national championship before and that's always been a dream of mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Pearsall, who earned Times all-county first-team, Southern Section Division IV 
and Century League MVP honors, rushed for 1,551 yards and scored 23 touchdowns 
-- five on kick returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearsall will play safety and also return kicks for the Trojans, said his 
father, Jim. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Robinson is a nice man," Jim said. "He came in early and offered Grant a 
scholarship early, and how can you forget that?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three other Times all-county football players -- Foothill's Chris Hoke, 
Fountain Valley's Ken Foersch, and Huntington Beach's Nick Ziegler -- also have 
made oral commitments. 
</P>

to Fresno State after a visit to the campus last weekend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went up there with a list of things and Fresno had nothing negative," 
Foersch said. "The students are really gung-ho."

also is a standout for the Oilers' volleyball team. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: COACH PICKS PERFECT TIME TO LEAVE CAL LUTHERAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Dunlap is going Down Under at a time when his men's basketball program at 
Cal Lutheran is at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran, 15-0, is off to its best start and is ranked No. 1 in the NCAA 
Division III West Region. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous best was last season, when an 8-0 start helped propel the 
Kingsmen to a share of the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference title. They also went 8-0 in 1983, but finished 14-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a collapse, the Kingsmen will have their most successful season. They 
are only five victories away from the school-record 20 set last season, when 
they lost seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap will leave after the season to coach professionally in Adelaide, 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap has been consulting with professional Australian teams for the last 
five years, taking a trip to do so each May. His interest was piqued by some 
Australian players who were on the Cal Lutheran team when he took over as coach 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations developed to the point that he was offered a job in August. With his 
wife's approval, he accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of this year's squad has not prompted regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of look at it as our last dance together," Dunlap said. "We 
appreciate our time together more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're basically a senior-laden team, and I was upfront with them through this 
whole process. I'm not naive enough to think that some wouldn't feel a little 
bit of a betrayal. But they know it was too good to pass up. I think they are 
happy for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through the season, the Kingsmen haven't missed a beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Damon Ridley leads the team with an average of 20 points -- he 
scored 42 against Pomona-Pitzer on Saturday -- and the Kingsmen (4-0 in SCIAC) 
have six players who average of 10 points or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cal Lutheran and LaVerne tied for the SCIAC championship last season, 
LaVerne was the conference's representative in the NCAA playoffs after having 
beaten the Kingsmen in a conference playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran went to the playoffs as an at-large team and LaVerne beat the 
Kingsmen again in the Division III Regionals.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Kingsmen are not motivated by revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know that every loss counts the same, no matter who you play," Dunlap 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it was a late-season upset by Redlands that allowed LaVerne to tie for 
the SCIAC championship. A coin flip gave LaVerne home-court advantage for the 
conference playoff game, which led to LaVerne having home-court advantage in 
the Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy to be where we are," Dunlap said. "But to win the SCIAC, you have 
to win on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LaVerne, which made it to the final 16 last season, was expected to be Cal 
Lutheran's toughest competition. But at 6-8, things have not been going as 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona-Pitzer has been a surprise, getting off to a 11-4 start (3-1 in SCIAC). 
Bill Cover, a senior forward, set the school record for points in a career 
before the holiday break. Phil Kelly and Brendan Fallis have been able to step 
up when Cover is double-teamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental (8-6, 2-2) returns with Blair Slattery, the SCIAC player of the 
year, who is leading the conference in scoring at 23.8 points per game and 
rebounds at 13.8. Like LaVerne, Occidental has suffered from losses to 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Anderson and Jason Bragg, who are among the SCIAC leaders in steals 
and scoring, lead running Redlands. The Bulldogs use an offense similar to the 
one Paul Westhead ran at Loyola Marymount several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a major upset if Claremont-Mudd (5-9), Caltech (8-4) or Whittier 
(2-13) finished in the top four in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech is 0-4 in the SCIAC, but the Beavers have a chance to win their first 
conference men's basketball game since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers have lost 56 in a row since rejoining the SCIAC at the varsity 
level in 1989. Their last victory was by 48-47 over LaVerne on Jan. 23, 1985. 
The next season, the program was dropped to the junior varsity level. 
</P>
<P>
 But this season, Caltech has five quality starters and took off to an 8-0 
nonconference record.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was great scheduling," Caltech Coach Gene Victor said with a laugh. 
"None of these kids came here to play basketball, but they work hard and we 
played some teams that were not as good as teams we see in the conference. But 
it's been fun for them." 
</P>
<P>
 It appears the first good shot at an upset will come at Whittier on Wednesday.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; TAR HEELS TOO MUCH FOR BUTLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many visitors to the Dean E. Smith Center at Chapel Hill, N.C., Butler 
Coach Barry Collier knew he was in trouble when he found himself in a building 
named for his counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a bad seat in the house -- unless you're sitting on the visitors' 
bench," said Collier before the Bulldogs took to the court Monday against 
fourth-ranked North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's Tar Heels quickly proved him right, taking a 22-8 lead en route to a 
104-64 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an over-under situation," Collier said. "We were underdogs and they 
overwhelmed us." 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely shooting outside of eight feet, North Carolina (15-3) made 42 of 69 
shots and limited Butler (8-9) to 26-of-68 shooting. When it did shoot outside, 
North Carolina made six of 12 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were everything you'd expect," Collier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Eric Montross led the Tar Heels with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 24 Missouri 89, Nebraska 73 -- Melvin Booker scored 22 points to help the 
Tigers (14-2, 5-0) celebrate their return to the top 25 with a Big Eight 
Conference victory over the Cornhuskers (12-4, 2-2) at Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada Las Vegas 87, UC Santa Barbara 85 -- The Runnin' Rebels came back from 
an 84-80 deficit with 48 seconds remaining to pull out the victory at Las 
Vegas. Earlier, the Gauchos had rallied after trailing, 66-52.

NBA ROUNDUP; BULLS ARE BEST IN EAST AFTER BEATING PISTONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen scored 23 points and the Chicago Bulls overcame a 14-point 
deficit to defeat the Detroit Pistons, 92-86, on Monday night at Auburn Hills, 
Mich., for their seventh consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen also finished with nine rebounds and nine assists, barely missing his 
third triple-double of the season. His efforts were enough to send the Pistons 
to their 16th loss in 17 games, and their ninth in a row at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave the Bulls the best record in the Eastern Conference, a 
half-game ahead of the Atlanta Hawks and one game in front of the New York 
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Dumars scored 25 points and Terry Mills 19 for Detroit, and they combined 
for 21 points in the first quarter, helping the Pistons take a 30-18 lead. 
Detroit pulled ahead, 36-22, early in the second period before Pippen scored 
eight points and Steve Kerr six as Chicago ended the half with a 24-10 run, 
tying the score, 46-46. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first half, we were very active defensively, and we gave a great 
passing exhibition," Piston Coach Don Chaney said. "Neither was there in the 
second half. Maybe our defense let up, and gave them easier shots. Maybe their 
defense picked it up, and stopped our passing game. I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 95, Seattle 90 -- Karl Malone had 26 points and 16 rebounds, John 
Stockton had 18 assists at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics, 4-4 after starting the season 26-3, came out strong against 
the Jazz, taking a 31-19 lead after one quarter. But Utah pulled ahead for good 
with a 19-1 run in the first 5:35 of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Payton scored 18 points and Detlef Schrempf, Shawn Kemp and Ricky Pierce 
each scored 14 for the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 110, Dallas 102 -- Rick Fox scored 22 points at Boston to help the 
Celtics beat the Mavericks for the second time in six days and extend their 
season-best winning streak to five games. 
</P>
<P>
 It was much easier than last Wednesday's 89-84 victory in which the Mavericks 
had a chance to tie with 17 seconds left, but Jamal Mashburn's three-point shot 
went long. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Celtics took the lead for good with a 6-0 run that made the 
score 61-56 with 8:57 to play in the third quarter. They extended the margin to 
75-65 with a 7-0 run that ended with 4:11 remaining in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks (2-37) have lost their last 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 96, Indiana 88 -- Jon Barry came off the bench to score a 
career-high 23 points, 12 of them in the final nine minutes, to help the Bucks 
rally at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 With his father and brother taking a night off from the CBA to attend, Barry 
came off the bench to make six of eight shots and 11 of 13 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Barry, an NBA Hall of Famer, coaches the CBA's Ft. Wayne Fury, where his 
son Scooter is a starting guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the first time my dad has seen me play in the NBA," Jon Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
 He treated his family to a career night, also making five steals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks came back from a 10-point deficit with less than nine minutes to 
play to win for the third time in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller led the Pacers with 26 points, but did not get off a shot in the 
fourth quarter against Barry.

 Treasury Bill Rates Drop: The Treasury Department sold $12.7 billion in new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 2.96%, down from 2.99% last 
week.Another $12.7 billion in new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 3.14%, down from 3.15% last week. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors: 3.02% for three-month bills, with a 
$10,000 T-bill selling for $9,925.20, and 3.23% for a six-month bill selling 
for $9,841.30. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value.

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-chip stocks closed slightly lower Monday, and the broad market also lost 
ground. Utility stocks took a surprising hit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond yields inched up as energy and lumber prices surged. But gold continued 
to ease. Stocks 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials gave up a 20-point early-afternoon gain by the close, 
finishing down 1.69 points at 3,912.79, after Friday's surge to new highs. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday was only the Dow's fourth losing session of 1994. But once again, the 
broad market diverged significantly from the Dow's performance. The New York 
Stock Exchange composite index sank 1.37 points, or 0.5%, to 261.75, and losers 
topped winners on the NYSE by 12 to 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular concern was another steep drop in electric utility shares. The 
Dow utility index tumbled 2.64 points, or 1.2%, to 217.11, the lowest since 
November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Weakness in utilities historically signals rising market interest rates down 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the Dow industrials' selloff late in the day was mostly the fault 
of computer-driven program trading. But they noted that, fundamentally, stocks 
are due for profit taking anyway, after their strong January run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has talked about how high the market is," said Tom Gallagher, chief 
trader at Oppenheimer & Co. "It would not be unusual to see the market roll 
over and have a couple weeks or a couple months of a correction." 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders said a stock selloff in Japan may have cooled enthusiasm in the 
U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's Nikkei index plunged 954.19 points, or 4.9%, to 18,353.24 on Monday, 
the largest one-day drop since Aug. 19, 1991. The slump was attributed to the 
surprise failure of political reform proposals in Japan's parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere overseas, London's FTSE-100 index eased 2.8 points to 3,481.4, while 
Frankfurt's DAX index added 16.64 points to 2,090.58. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index hit a new high, rising 10.53 points to 
2,693.71. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow lost ground despite a surge in IBM, which jumped 3 3/8 to 58 5/8 on 
optimism about the firm's 1993 earnings report, due today. 
</P>
<P>
 Also gaining in the Dow were Caterpillar, up 1 5/8 to 100 1/4 on the heels of 
its strong quarterly earnings report Friday; Alcoa, up 1 3/4 to 75 5/8, and 
Chevron, up 1 1/4 to 92 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, profit takers clipped Procter & Gamble 1 1/8 to 58 1/4; 
United Technologies was down 1 1/8 to 64 and GM fell 3/4 to 60 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Metal and mining stocks helped stoke another rally in heavy-industry shares. 
Nucor rose 1 3/4 to 58 3/4, National Steel jumped 1 3/4 to 15 7/8 and Reynolds 
Metals shot up 2 3/8 to 50 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among companies reporting earnings Monday, pinball-game maker WMS Industries 
gained 1 1/2 to 25 1/4 and apparel maker Tommy Hilfiger jumped 2 3/8 to 32 1/2. 
But insurance firm SunAmerica eased 7/8 to 37 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Software retailer Egghead gained 7/8 to 9 3/4. Paul Allen, co-founder of 
Microsoft, said he has purchased a 7.5% stake in the firm for investment 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Modular classroom builder Modtech leaped 1 1/16 to 2 1/16. Some investors 
bet the firm will benefit from school reconstruction after the Southland 
earthquake. Other Markets 
</P>
<P>
 Bond market trading was described as technically driven, with little news to 
propel yields from the narrow range that has dominated recent trading action. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose to 6.30% from 6.28% on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, crude oil prices jumped, reversing earlier losses, 
after the U.S.'s fourth-largest refinery was forced to cut its output following 
a weekend fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Amoco Oil shut three crude-processing units at a refinery in Whiting, Ind., 
after three fires struck the facility during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 West Texas intermediate crude futures jumped to $15.17 a barrel, up 23 cents 
on the New York Merc.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, lumber futures again rose their daily limit as improved weather 
conditions in the eastern U.S. raised hopes for a resumption of building 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumber for March delivery settled up $10 to $417.80 per thousand board feet. 
The March contract has risen its maximum daily limit three times in the past 
four sessions.

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-chip stocks closed slightly lower Monday as the market paused to catch 
its breath after its recent string of record closes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term bond yields rose slightly as investors played it safe ahead of 
upcoming note auctions and economic reports. Stocks 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 1.69 points at 3,912.79. It was 
only its fourth losing session of 1994 and ended a run of five new highs in the 
previous six trading days. The indicator had risen nearly 20 points in early 
trading before falling back. 
</P>
<P>
 While that drop on paper appeared small, analysts said there were reasons to 
be concerned. A bigger drop was prevented only by gains in a handful of issues, 
while other market indicators were uniformly lower. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has talked about how high the market is," said Tom Gallagher, chief 
trader at Oppenheimer & Co. "It would not be unusual to see the market roll 
over and have a couple weeks or a couple months of a correction." 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by 
about 4 to 3. Big Board volume totaled 299.99 million shares, down from 
Friday's 346.23 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The market seemed poised for a weak opening. Overseas, the Japanese stock 
market suffered a steep decline of almost 5%. Share prices finished narrowly 
lower in London, with the Financial Times 100-share average falling 2.8 points 
to 3,481.4. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 closed up 16.64 points at 2,090.58 after a floor 
close of 2,080.01. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index closed up 10.53 points at 2,693.71, surpassing its 
previous closing record of 2,684.17, set Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM jumped 3 3/8 to 58 5/8 in anticipation that its fourth-quarter earnings 
report, to be released Tuesday, would show the computer giant's first profit in 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caterpillar rose 1 5/8 to 100 1/4 on the heels of higher than expected 
earnings reported Friday. Chevron, another key Dow component, gained 1 to 92 
5/8. Alcoa finished up 3/4 at 75 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nynex said it will cut its work force by 16,800 by the end of 1996 and 
reported a net fourth-quarter loss of $1.24 billion, or $3 a share. The stock 
ended down 1/4 to 39 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple Computer was the most active Nasdaq stock, rising 1 5/8 to 35 after 
announcing a deal with BellSouth for its Newton MessagePad. 
</P>
<P>
 * Compuware gained 2 1/2 to 33. After the close, it reported a rise in 
third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boeing posted fourth-quarter earnings that were above Wall Street 
expectations, but analysts said a full recovery at the aerospace company is 
still a ways off. It fell 7/8 to 44 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among decliners, American Telephone & Telegraph fell 1/2 to 55 1/2, 3M fell 
1 3/8 to 111 and Procter & Gamble lost 1 1/8 to 58 1/4. Other Markets 
</P>
<P>
 Bond market trading was described as technically driven, with little news to 
propel prices from the narrow range that has dominated recent trading action. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose to 6.30% from 6.28%, while 
its price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 5/16 point, or $3.13 per 
$1,000 in face value.  
</P>
<P>
 Prices of short-term Treasury securities, meanwhile, were 1/32 point lower to 
unchanged, and intermediate maturities fell by up to 5/32 point, the Telerate 
Inc. financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the scattered price declines were not linked to any single 
factor but instead reflected the sentiment that the market has little room to 
further advance after last year's powerful rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in currency trading, the dollar finished mixed in light trading, as 
some traders sold the currency to lock in profits from its rise Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar stayed within narrow ranges against most European currencies, 
traders said. After rising against the Japanese yen during Tokyo trading, the 
dollar began to fall, closing just above its Friday level. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, gold prices weakened. On the New York Comex, gold for 
current delivery closed at $381.10 an ounce, off 30 cents from Friday, while 
silver for current delivery closed at $5.106 an ounce, up 0.4 cent. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, light, sweet crude oil for March delivery rose 23 cents to $15.17 a 
barrel.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: GRAMERCY SHINES AS CINDERELLA OF SUNDANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If past Sundance Film Festivals are remembered for launching individual 
careers, this one may become equally well known for helping to launch an entire 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Gramercy Pictures has emerged as a Cinderella of Sundance, thanks to two 
high-profile films. "Four Weddings and a Funeral," an offbeat comedy starring 
Andie MacDowell, got the prized opening-night slot. And "Backbeat," which 
traces the formative years of the Beatles, is so much in demand that the 
festival has scheduled a rare extra screening. 
</P>
<P>
 With both movies opening in the spring, the independent marketing and 
distribution company hopes the positive buzz from Sundance will translate into 
financial success. "You never know which movies are going to click, but 
festivals can be pretty good gauges," said Russell Schwartz, Gramercy's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen-month-old Gramercy, a joint venture of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment 
and Universal Pictures, is still looking for its first breakaway hit in the 
specialized film market. Last year's "Posse" did modestly well, taking in $18 
million at domestic box offices. But "King of the Hill," "A Dangerous Woman" 
and "Dazed and Confused" got cool receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 People who follow the rough-and-tumble world of independent film distribution 
see better potential in this year's 13-picture slate from Gramercy, which also 
includes the controversial comedy-thriller "Romeo Is Bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
 Gramercy celebrated its Sundance success Sunday with a dinner at Adolph's, one 
of the most exotic restaurants in this snow-ringed ski resort -- with entree 
offerings such as pheasant, bison, venison and medallion of elk. 
</P>
<P>
 On hand was Michael Kuhn, president of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, as well 
as executives from other PolyGram film labels and the producers of "Backbeat" 
-- the same team responsible for last year's surprise hit "The Crying Game." 
</P>
<P>
 In a show of support, London-based PolyGram Chairman Alain Levy even dropped 
in on the festival after taking the Concorde to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn said PolyGram is optimistic that its investment in Gramercy will begin to 
pay off this year. "It's hard to judge a company based on so few movies," Kuhn 
said, "but they've certainly got some good stuff in the can." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz avoided making any predictions. He said the past year taught him a 
lot about the vagaries of the business. In the case of "Dazed and Confused," a 
look at the drug-hazy lives of high school students in the 1970s, Schwartz said 
he learned that young people no longer necessarily respond to antiheroes. 
</P>
<P>
 One marketing ploy aimed at the young, however, has the industry buzzing: a 
decision to recruit members of cutting-edge bands such as Nirvana, Soul Asylum, 
R.E.M. and Afghan Wigs for the "Backbeat" soundtrack, under the direction of 
music producer Don Was. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still honing the process," Schwartz said, "but we've learned a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fears that last week's earthquake might cut into business at the festival 
appear to be unfounded. While many Hollywood deal makers won't arrive until the 
second half of the 10-day event, business is already well under way.  
</P>
<P>
 Sony Pictures Classics got things rolling Friday, the second day of the 
festival, when it acquired domestic and other rights to "Martha and Ethel." 
Marcie Bloom, co-president of the company, said she first heard about director 
Jyl Johnstone's look at former nannies while it was being processed at the lab. 
</P>
<P>
 She attended the first screening Friday morning, before her partners arrived, 
and made the deal later in the day -- before she had even picked up her 
festival credentials. "It's just terrific!" Bloom said of the movie. "It's 
really a sly social commentary on the family. Once people start talking about 
the movie, the rest will take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Goldwyn Co. followed on Saturday by acquiring worldwide rights to "Go 
Fish," an inside view of lesbian life shot in black and white by director Rose 
Troche. Goldwyn's Tom Rothman said the company moved quickly to preempt other 
bids. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the old expression, 'You snooze, you lose,' " said Rothman, who had to 
fly back to Los Angeles when aftershocks threatened his home. "This gives us 
the entire festival to publicize the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothman called "Go Fish" one of the liveliest pictures at the festival. He 
said it also poses "an exciting marketing challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 The buying continued Monday, as I.R.S. picked up the rights to the Canadian 
film "I Love a Man in Uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 Many films have come to the festival with distributors attached, but deal 
makers are still hunting for fresh directing and writing talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one: "They like to play up the artsy aspects of the festival, but what 
everyone is looking for is people with commercial potential." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sundance also acknowledged technology's growing influence on film, with a 
seminar on Sunday called "Interactivity and Cinema." 
</P>
<P>
 Panelists Joe Miller, head of production for Sega America, noted that the 
domestic video game business last year caught up to the domestic box office 
business, with about $5 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Miller extended an olive branch to the entertainment 
community by saying the video game industry desperately needs Hollywood's 
storytelling skills. 
</P>
<P>
 That brought an icy response from producer Sean Daniel. He said advancing 
technologies threaten to make second-class citizens of conventional filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rebels of the future are going to be those struggling to make linear 
movies -- that's going to be the fringe," Daniel said.  
</P>
<P>
 Referring to all the options offered by interactive technology, Daniel added, 
"I don't want an interactive 'Grand Illusion' or 'Godfather.' "

 Film: Hit-starved Columbia Pictures says it finally has a winner in the Mike 
Nichols-directed "Wolf," a romantic thriller starring Jack Nicholson and 
Michelle Pfeiffer. The studio maintains that's why it moved the movie's release 
date from March 30 to June 24, the height of the summer season."We were 
convinced at the most recent screening that we've got a big movie that can 
withstand summer competition," said Jeff Blake, president of distribution. 
Nicholson plays a Manhattan book editor who is bitten on the wrist by a wolf 
and tries to resist being transformed into a beast. The new opening date puts 
the picture up against "The Lion King," an animated Walt Disney musical 
feature, opening nationally that day. "We're willing to trade increased 
competition for better play time," Blake said. TERRY PRISTIN

ART / CATHY CURTIS; UNNATURAL HISTORY; 'PARTIAL RECALL' ENCOURAGES VIEWERS TO 
QUESTION WHAT THEY SEE

 Nothing is black and white about photographs except the effect of light on the 
film emulsion.  
</P>
<P>
 Although filled with concrete details, photographs may exude intangible, 
between-the-lines emotions. They may show real people in settings or activities 
that are a figment of the photographer's imagination. The passage of time may 
expose their lies or deepen their mysteries -- or both. 
</P>
<P>
 At the UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery through Feb. 12, "Partial Recall: 
Photographs of Native North Americans" -- organized by the Tyler Galleries at 
the Tyler School of Art, Philadelphia -- consists mostly of historical 
photographs of Native Americans drawn from various museums and archives. 
</P>
<P>
 Art critic Lucy Lippard, co-curator with Tyler Gallery director Don Desmett, 
sets the tone of the show with an essay about the mixture of nostalgia (for 
ethical values no longer in vogue), historical vagueness and awareness of 
exploitation that colors the ways we perceive these photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than condemning them all as lies, however, Lippard points out that the 
sitters do communicate on a human level, if we allow ourselves "a physical, 
tangible, sensuous experience of the image." 
</P>
<P>
 There is also another key issue. By today's standards, most photographers of 
Native Americans were exploitative or at least irritatingly paternalistic. But 
for better or worse, their photographs are among the few images we have of a 
vanished past, of civilizations extinguished forever. 
</P>
<P>
 By mingling the fragmentary information written on the photographs with 
historical facts and latter-day commentaries by Native American writers and 
artists, the show offers an unpredictable range of viewpoints. But most 
important are the images themselves. Viewed from a vantage of 50 to 100 years, 
they are remarkable in terms of what they include as well as what they leave 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in photographs obviously meant to celebrate assimilation into white 
society, facial expressions can reveal a psychic loss. At Battleford Industrial 
School in Saskatchewan, Native Americans were separated from their families, 
forbidden to speak their own languages, or even to wear their hair in the long 
tribal fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Posing in letter sweaters and knee pants, members of the school's 1897 
football team seem to have unusually hardened or pensive expressions for boys 
of their age. (On the other hand, if you didn't know about their backgrounds, 
you might think they were simply thinking about Saturday's game. Such is the 
intrinsically elusive, malleable quality of photographic imagery.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many images in the show are studio shots. Some show Native Americans posed 
against a plain backdrop, giving the effect of captured "savages" displayed to 
amuse civilized gawkers. (Ishi, the last survivor of the Yahi tribe of Northern 
California, is seen bare-chested, with gleaming, uplifted eyes in a photo from 
about 1913, rather like a reformed sinner or prisoner in a silent movie.) 
</P>
<P>
 Other subjects were shot in outdoor settings altered to suit contemporary 
notions of picturesqueness. "Before and after" versions show that the Ute 
gathering in "The Messenger: Severo on Horseback Telling Buckskin Charlie" was 
originally photographed in a nondescript suburban area. Paint turned the 
background into a snowy mountain wilderness, and a fire and a ceramic pot were 
gratuitously added to the foreground. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the anthropological straightforwardness of "A Dying Mojave" by 
photographer Ben Wittick appears suspect (as does the breezy comment on the 
label). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Were the people gathered around the skeletal man in a loincloth really 
smiling? Were the pot and bowl part of the last rites, or a photographer's 
window dressing? And what does it mean, exactly, to say that the Mojaves' 
religious beliefs "centered on the acquisition of power by dreams"? 
</P>
<P>
 Some Native Americans were shown doing incongruous, "all-American" things 
(like the Ute Girl Scouts who hold absurdly long twigs with wienies attached, 
as if they needed campfire training) while other sitters were pressed into 
service as passive symbols of assimilation (a smiling elderly woman in native 
dress getting a beauty-shop manicure). 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the photographers were white. Frank Matsura, a Japanese immigrant, 
shot such images as "Two Girls on Couch," from about 1910. The two young Native 
American women in long white dresses reclining on a Victorian chaise longue, 
presumably in Matsura's studio. One seems lost in thought while the other 
exudes calm strength and rests a supportive hand on her friend's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsura may have requested these poses, of course, yet something about the 
women seems truly intimate and genuine. Did his own heritage allow him to be 
more attuned than most to the tact and trust required to reveal a private state 
of mind? 
</P>
<P>
 Commentator Rayna Green writes: "Generations survived after them because they 
were tough, flexible, sound. Matsura saw it." 
</P>
<P>
 But what are we to make of the plate with a reproduction of James Frazier's 
stereotyped sculpture, "End of the Trail?" seen in the contemporary home of 
Julian Kills in Sight, whose tribe is not specified? Does he admire the image 
of his people conveyed by this drowsy fellow on horseback? Or did he buy it in 
the spirit of African Americans who collect Aunt Jemima dolls? 
</P>
<P>
 Some apparent contradictions are savvier than they seem. In a 1904 photo, 
Geronimo, the elderly Apache leader, glowers under a glossy top hat as he sits 
at the wheel of an automobile, surrounded by passengers in native dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Held prisoner at Ft. Sill in Oklahoma for a decade by the U.S. government, he 
adapted shrewdly to certain customs of his exploiters. He became a member of 
the Dutch Reformed Church and hawked photographs and his signature when, 
accompanied by a guard, he attended the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Native American Jimmie Durham writes about this photograph that "no matter 
what has been taken from (Geronimo), he has given up nothing." The chief's 
piercing expression, Durham adds, is a "challenge" to the viewer's "personal 
integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Commentator David Seals perceives a similar triumph -- in this case, a strange 
complicity between sitters and photographer -- in a contemporary shot by Sarah 
Pennon. Three hostile-looking Lakota men are shown in the snowy landscape of 
Wounded Knee Creek -- site of the infamous December 1890 massacre that reduced 
a once-mighty nation to a handful of scattered tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think these three people wanted this white woman to take their 
picture," Seals writes. " 'So what, they're mad at me,' this picture says. 
'Show me your anger because that is righteous and beautiful, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition also includes a small group of contemporary photographs by 
three Native Americans, including warmly intimate portraits of tribal elders by 
David Neel and more elaborate projects that seem short on subtlety or 
freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, these photographs cannot offer the inadvertent aura of mystery 
that makes the historical images so sadly, provocatively captivating. 
</P>
<P>
 The true strength of this show is its encouragement to viewers to question 
virtually everything they see in it -- to hold what passes for history up to 
the light to check for the tiniest flaws and holes.

THE WEEK AHEAD: KIEV; BIG WEEK FOR NUKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ukraine's Parliament opens debate today on the nuclear disarmament agreement 
that President Leonid Kravchuk signed earlier this month with Russia and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk insists that the agreement -- which would rid Ukraine of all nuclear 
weapons within seven years in exchange for secure borders, nuclear reactor fuel 
and more than $1 billion in U.S. aid -- does not require Parliament's 
ratification.But he is lobbying to avoid an outright rejection that would make 
it politically hard to fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reaction among lawmakers was hostile to the pact. But they decided to 
have four legislative committees examine it and report to Parliament. A vote is 
expected by Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 (An item published in this column last week incorrectly stated that the debate 
would began earlier.)

THE WEEK AHEAD: SAINT-OUEN; SEEKING A NEW LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The French Communist Party, in decline for 20 years, opens its annual congress 
in the suburbs of Paris today, with the top agenda item election of a successor 
to veteran leader Georges Marchais, 73, who is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 The party has seen its support drop from 25% in the 1972 election, when 
Marchais took over and the Communists were the dominant force on the French 
left, to less than 10% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there is no heir apparent, many in the party hope that a new leader 
will revitalize it by modernizing and softening what has been an ideological 
hard line.

THE WEEK AHEAD: MADRID; CLASH OVER LABOR LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unions say they'll shut down Spain for 24 hours Thursday in a general strike 
against government attempts to abolish labor laws that gave workers four 
decades of ironclad job security.  
</P>
<P>
 The unions hope to force Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to scotch new laws 
that make it easier for employers to fire, transfer and change job descriptions 
of their workers.Foreign investors and Spanish businesses claim that the old 
laws are the main reason that Spain has Europe's highest jobless rate -- 23%. 
Employers, they say, are encouraged to keep payrolls at a minimum because 
once-hired, never-fired laws mean they can't prune staff when the economy 
slows.  
</P>
<P>
 Unions say loosening job protection won't create jobs but rather will enable 
employers to replace veteran workers with cheaper new ones.

ELECTION UMPIRE CALLS THEM AS HE SEES THEM; SHYNESS ISN'T A PROBLEM FOR INDIA'S 
T. N. SESHAN, WHO IS PROUD OF DRIVING 'THE FEAR OF GOD' INTO LAW-BREAKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 India's mandarin-like civil servants? No better than "polished call girls." 
</P>
<P>
 His own baldness? "God made some heads beautiful. The others he covered with 
hair." 
</P>
<P>
 It's virtually certain that if you live outside India, you've never heard of 
T. N. Seshan. But if you reside here, you simply can't ignore his outspoken, 
often outrageous views. For three years, the bull-necked career bureaucrat with 
the gleaming toffee-hued dome has served as India's chief election 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest accomplishment? "I have driven the fear of God into people who 
broke the system," he says proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the world's single largest democracy -- so huge that a nationwide election 
mobilizes 550 million voters and more than 350 registered parties, generates 
20,000 tons of paper ballots and requires 700,000 polling booths and an army of 
3 million to 4.5 million poll workers -- Seshan is the self-defined "umpire." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Indian election system is one of the greatest marvels of the world, after 
the Taj Mahal," he has mused. So how's the umpire doing?  
</P>
<P>
 If controversy is the measure, he's doing well indeed. For in the past year, 
though Seshan commands a full-time staff of only 192, he arguably became the 
most important, and certainly the most exasperating and hotly debated, figure 
in Indian public life. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Delhi building that houses the Election Commission is now guarded by a 
squad of soldiers armed with automatics, and its bulky 60-year-old master is 
chauffeured around in a limo armored to stop a 5.6-millimeter bullet fired from 
a yard away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the danger, it's important to realize that intimidating 
violence, ballot-box stuffing and official manipulation of results used to be 
as much a part of elections in India as the ritual garland of bright yellow 
marigolds for the victor. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before the "Seshan factor' kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, 143 million people across northern India were called to the 
polls to choose their local assemblies. The Times of India approvingly observed 
that for the first time in years, "the electoral process in five major states 
was conducted without officially inspired rigging and malpractices." 
</P>
<P>
 In Uttar Pradesh, a state particularly notorious for election shenanigans and 
bullying, there were only two murders. In 1991, there had been more than 190. 
</P>
<P>
 What did Seshan do? "In U. P., I had 40,000 central policemen all over the 
place," he confides. That virtually ended the usual intimidation of voters, and 
as a result a coalition came to power that favors the disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the job he holds is mandated by the constitution, chief election 
commissioners before Seshan were little more than glorified errand boys for the 
government, which manipulated the electoral process to further its grip on 
power. Seshan refuses to do what people working for Prime Minister P. V. 
Narasimha Rao order. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I am a subordinate of government, God save this country's elections," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Subordinate is a word few would apply to Seshan, although he is a 36-year 
veteran of India's prestigious civil service -- the same bunch he now claims is 
"98% corrupt" and likens to prostitutes. He held a succession of plum 
government jobs and even served nine months as Cabinet secretary, or India's 
No. 1 bureaucrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics carp that if Seshan had complaints about public administration, he 
certainly kept quiet for a self-servingly long time. Bhuvnesh Chaturvedi, a 
member of Parliament for the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, says 
Seshan's headline-grabbing comments are those of an "abnormal man." 
</P>
<P>
 For almost a year, Seshan and India's government have been waging a dispute so 
acrimonious that the commissioner is boycotting all official functions. In a 
nutshell, the government rejects Seshan's contention that he has the 
constitutional authority to order its staff to run and keep order at elections 
and that he can punish bureaucrats who won't comply. "That is something I was 
not willing to stomach," Seshan says. 
</P>
<P>
 He struck back last August by postponing all elections. The Supreme Court then 
gave him the interim powers he sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a leaf from Franklin D. Roosevelt's notebook, Rao's government moved to 
dilute Seshan's authority by appointing two additional commissioners. But 
Seshan, who as commission chief enjoys special status conferred by the 
constitution, is uncowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way you can send me home is by going through the process of 
impeachment," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He now is going after 20 members of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of 
Parliament, for allegedly falsifying their places of residence so they could 
get elected from states they don't live in. If those allegations are true, 
Seshan wants charges brought. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hardly a move that will earn him brownie points with India's already 
alienated government -- one of the probe targets is Finance Minister Manmohan 
Singh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seshan wants photo identity cards for voters introduced by Jan. 1 of next year 
-- a laudable undertaking to cleanse often suspect voter rolls of the dead and 
departed, but dauntingly ambitious given the size of the electorate and the 
fact that millions of Indians have no fixed address and sleep on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely out of the headlines, Seshan in the past few weeks has ordered 
political parties to remove the posters and graffiti from the last election and 
has banned the licensing of new firearms during campaigns.  
</P>
<P>
 Bare-chested and armed with a constable's iron-tipped lathi, or stave, he 
robustly kept order at the January funeral of a Hindu holy man, barking orders 
at policemen and using his beefy torso to block entry to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 A scandal threatened to engulf the "Mr. Clean" of Indian politics when it 
became known that Seshan flew to the funeral aboard a jet he requisitioned from 
a leading industrialist. But Seshan said he had paid for the flight, and 
produced the photocopy of a $3,000 personal check he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Most significantly, in a 12-page order, Seshan has directed district election 
officers throughout the country to scrutinize candidates' campaign spending. 
For a typical parliamentary seat, spending is supposed to be limited to 200,000 
rupees, or about $6,500. 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, he says, candidates shell out up to 80 million rupees, or almost 
$2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't get rid of them by saying they've spent more money," Seshan admits. 
"But I intend to expose them." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the source of that bankroll -- official corruption -- that really 
preoccupies Seshan and gets him worrying about the future of Indian democracy. 
Corruption, he says, is endemic because almost every big purchase or decision 
involves politicians or government officials who can skim money off contracts 
or demand kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can buy a condom from X instead of Y in the United States," Seshan says 
with his usual flair for the outrageous. "If you want a condom in India, you 
have to largely buy from the public sector." 
</P>
<P>
 What has evolved in his country, Seshan explains, is a three-sided, incestuous 
process. First, elections serve as the source of power. Through corruption, an 
officeholder can then accumulate "black money." He can then use his stash to 
finance reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 And so on, ad infinitum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't seem to have a way to break this triangle," Seshan complains. But 
he's striking where the triangular process begins -- elections -- to enforce 
spending limits and try to minimize incumbents' use of the perks of office 
while campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor of Himachal Pradesh learned the hard way that Seshan was serious. 
He borrowed an official car to campaign for his son, Seshan says. The 
commissioner roundly condemned the father and announced he was delaying local 
elections for three months. Two days later, the governor was replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, India's chief election commissioner does not vote himself -- he 
believes it would harm his impartiality.  
</P>
<P>
 Once, he says, when he worked for India's Oil and Natural Gas Commission, he 
did try. "The man read through the list and said, 'Yes, name correct, yes, 
address correct, yes, age correct,' " Seshan recalled. "And then he said, 'But 
this list says you're a female.' "

 For some, last week's San Fernando Valley earthquake reminded them that they 
too are vulnerable. Others saw in the aftermath cause to feel superior. For 
still others, it was a chance to muse about humankind's relationship with 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at world press reaction to the quake: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "In California, major earthquakes are assumed by a well-prepared population 
that makes planning for disaster both a public and a personal priority. Here, 
most of us live in dreamland. We don't really believe that any of this will 
happen to us, although the geological record says it can and science suggests a 
high degree of probability for a shock up to a hundred times more powerful 
(than the one which shook the San Fernando Valley)."

 "The nightmare seems to continue for this state that represented America's El 
Dorado . . . the dream, a magic blending of strass (paste jewelry), sun and 
Pacific sea spray, has turned into a nightmare. . . . Social and economic costs 
come on top of an emotional cost, generated by repeated catastrophes, that 
cannot be overlooked. Since 1993, more than three hundred thousand people have 
left California, and the economic recession, linked to the severe blows dealt 
by fate, has generated a loss of eight hundred thousand jobs in what used to be 
a Golden State."

dictates. On 9 January 1857, a large earthquake gave the village of Los Angeles 
an indication that it was poorly founded. Tokyo has been reminded of its faults 
roughly every 70 years. Yet still these cities have grown. Perhaps the human 
lifespan is simply too short and the Big One too infrequent to persuade people 
to live wisely rather than dangerously."

NATIONAL AGENDA; FREE MARKET PERILS VIETNAM'S HEALTH; WORLD AGENCIES WORRY THAT 
THE COUNTRY MAY DIVERT RESOURCES AWAY FROM SOCIAL NEEDS, JEOPARDIZING HUGE 
GAINS MADE IN RECENT YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY NELSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Nelson, a former Times medical writer, 
was one of three U.S. journalists in Vietnam recently on a UNICEF-sponsored 
fact-finding tour. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vietnam's efforts to open up the country to foreign trade may well improve its 
flagging economy, but health experts fear that the pace of the free-market 
reforms is threatening gains made in recent decades in improving the health of 
the Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 Already international health agencies like the United Nations Children's Fund 
are reporting a drop in the use of health centers as services get worse and 
facilities deteriorate. Rural areas, where 85% of the country's 71.5 million 
people live, are especially affected, according to UNICEF. 
</P>
<P>
 After many years of central government support, provinces and rural villages 
now must handle local problems alone as the government diverts funds away from 
health and social programs to projects aimed at building the gross national 
product. It's all a part of Doi Moi , the free-market fiscal reforms first 
announced in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors, nurses and community health workers in Vietnam's extensive network of 
primary care centers now must charge fees in order to supplement their 
vanishing salaries, thus building a barrier to easy access by the poor. The 
average income in Vietnam is $250 a year; it drops to $85 in mountainous rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Many unregistered physicians, often without scruples, are taking advantage of 
entrepreneurship and joining the ranks of doctors who are quit the public 
system and go into private practice in places where there is money, due in part 
to foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam made great strides improving literacy and creating a credible health 
system in the decades after independence from France in the 1950s. Eighty-five 
percent of the people are literate. A U.S. government report states that 
between 1945 and 1979, Vietnam built an extensive network of hospitals as well 
as 10,000 maternity clinics and rural health centers. The number of doctors 
grew from one physician for every 180,000 people in 1945 to one physician per 
1,000 people by 1979. The average life expectancy grew from 34 years to 63 
years during that period. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 UNICEF statistics show that some major health indicators continued to improve 
into the 1990s. Life expectancy, for example, had grown to 67 years by 
1990.Child death rates were reduced by half between 1980 and 1991, and 
immunization rates against measles and other childhood diseases rose sharply, 
due in part to World Health Organization and UNICEF programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite those improvements, 43% of children under age 5 are malnourished, 
and deaths from diarrhea and respiratory diseases, malaria and dengue fever are 
high among the young, according to UNICEF, which has health activities in 23 of 
the country's 53 provinces. The organization also reports that only 21% of the 
rural population has access to safe drinking water and 17% to adequate 
sanitation; cholera is endemic in many places; 20% of newborns have low birth 
weight -- a growing trend -- and six out of 10 pregnant women have iron 
deficiency anemia. The concern among international agencies is that the 
government's concentration on becoming an effective participant in the world 
community will result in damage to health and social infrastructures, which are 
key requirements for a prosperous future.  
</P>
<P>
 " Doi Moi is indeed improving the general situation of Vietnam's people but 
the reform pace is also placing in jeopardy social services for women and 
children -- society's most vulnerable," UNICEF recently reported.  
</P>
<P>
 There is an urgent need, the agency says, for greater international assistance 
to help maintain the social and welfare gains of the past and to ensure that 
the economic reforms benefit all. 
</P>
<P>
 UNICEF is the only major organization currently helping the government to 
provide people with safe drinking water and improved sanitation. It also is 
engaged in improving nutrition, education and living arrangements for women. 
Poor sanitation and lack of safe water are the major factors jeopardizing the 
health of children in Vietnam.  
</P>
<P>
 On the outskirts of Hanoi, a Vietnamese factory that once made armaments is 
turning out water pumps for UNICEF partially paid for by village communes. They 
are used to draw clean ground water from wells dug by villagers, sometimes with 
outside help. Well drilling occurs simultaneously with health education 
programs and latrine projects so that the people will avoid using surface water 
for both drinking and elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 In the commune of Tu Ly, several hours by road northwest of Hanoi, an 
assistant doctor shows visitors through his primary care health center, which 
serves 5,000 rural residents. The three major health problems, he says, are 
malaria, malnutrition and goiters, the last due to lack of iodine in the diet. 
The center is sparsely equipped with the tools of medicine and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 A midwife displays a rusty obstetrics table, a relic of the past, where 54 of 
the 55 babies born in the commune were delivered this year. The midwife, who 
has worked there for 10 years, is paid $6.25 a month.  
</P>
<P>
 In another commune, UNICEF is partially funding a pilot teacher training 
center that will supply instructors for first- through fifth-grade students in 
mountain villages as far as 60 miles away. The trainees, as well as the 
inhabitants of villages where they will teach, are members of ethnic minority 
tribes whose members are among the country's poorest citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is an example of how the agency works with the government to 
further improve the literacy rate. The 50 trainees range in age from 15 to 20 
and are students themselves in the eighth and ninth grades. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers, like doctors, have been quitting the profession because of low pay 
-- $6 a month -- and the schools are deteriorating, an official explains. 
Schooling is supposed to be free but is now subsidized only during the first 
four years, he says. Many youngsters stop at the fourth grade and go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Duong Quynh Hoa, director of the Center of Pediatrics, Development and 
Health in Ho Chi Minh City, is one of the most outspoken critics of the 
government's diversion of funds away from health and social programs. As 
minister of health in the north from 1966 to 1974, she played a role in 
developing the primary health care network that now is crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoa once was accused of being a dissident for insisting publicly that Vietnam 
had a serious malnutrition problem, a stand that few other critics could take 
safely at the time. She survived probably because of her longtime relationships 
with many of the nation's leaders, which date to the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from seeing to adequate funding of the health system, Hoa's efforts 
today include encouraging young health workers to become more politically 
active in opposing government policies that harm health. She also encourages 
the return of more Vietnamese exiles, whose goal is to help build their 
country.  
</P>
<P>
 A former Communist Party member, Hoa said in an interview that most Vietnamese 
still believe it is not possible to fight government policies. This is a 
mistake, she said, because "the government is very realistic and pragmatic" and 
there is a greater chance of quick change from old conformist ways of thinking 
than there is, for example, in China, which has a longer history of socialism. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she added, it is a mistake for the government "to say that we must 
commercialize health. There are two fields that cannot be commercialized -- 
health and education. The lives of all the people must be improved. You can't 
improve only at the top."

MEDIA; PUBLISHERS REACHING OUT TO NOUVEAUX READERS; MAGAZINES RUSH TO TELL 
RUSSIA'S NEW RICH HOW TO SPEND THEIR MONEY TASTEFULLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH KNOBEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the old days, Soviet magazines like Rural Life and Worker Woman offered 
readers such mundane articles as "Tips for Fixing Your Tractor" and "How Our 
Factory Fulfilled its Production Quota." 
</P>
<P>
 But today, there are Russian magazines with a very different goal: Telling the 
nouveaux riches how to spend their money. 
</P>
<P>
 Trendy Americans with money to burn, after all, have upscale publications like 
Architectural Digest, Vanity Fair, Connoisseur and Vogue -- all full of 
articles and advertisements suggesting ways to spend copious amounts of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 So why not Russians, bent on catching up with their shopping after years of 
empty shelves? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people here with a lot of money sitting in their pockets," Igor 
Grigoriev, editor of the new Imperial magazine, said. "It's suicidal to keep a 
lot of money around because you don't know what's going to happen here. The 
government could pass laws taking it all away. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we want to explain to Russians how to spend their money tastefully 
-- what to wear, what perfume is good, which car is prestigious." 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance of publications like Imperial underlines how quickly some 
Russians are progressing toward a Western-quality lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 And how quickly capitalism is developing here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While there is much hardship as Russia tries to reform its economy, BBDO, an 
international advertising agency, estimates that in Moscow alone there are also 
more than 10,000 Russians who make more than $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are other wealthy Russians, particularly in 20 other Russian cities 
with more than 1 million population.  
</P>
<P>
 Russia's new rich include entrepreneurs who have started successful businesses 
and people working for foreign firms who draw a Western-size salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wealthy Russians -- members of organized crime gangs, racketeers and 
smugglers stealing valuable natural resources -- make their money through 
illegal means. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the new publications appealing to the rich:  
</P>
<P>
 * 4WD Live, a German magazine devoted to four-wheel drive vehicles, which 
launched a Russian edition last June. The glossy magazine, on sale for "hard" 
currency only, profiles the latest off-road vehicles from around the world.  
</P>
<P>
 * The weekly newspaper Inostranets (Foreigner) is "for those (Russians) who 
are leaving forever, those who are leaving for a while and those who are 
staying home," according to the paper's masthead. The paper's regular 
departments include "Work," "Tourism" and "Repatriation" as well as features on 
Russians living abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most (Bridge) is a slick monthly business magazine that attracted intense 
interest with a list of the 50 richest Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two other magazines were created with the specific goal of educating Russians 
about conspicuous consumption.  
</P>
<P>
 Grigoriev's Imperial is the more ambitious of the two, covering business, 
fashion, travel and leisure. "Our magazine is for the beautiful people," the 
26-year-old editor, who met with magazine editors in London while planning 
Imperial, explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for people who drive BMWs, who buy clothes by Hermes and who wear 
cologne from Pierre Cardin." 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial's thick, glossy pilot edition, published in September, was like 
nothing Russians have ever seen. One article featured Hawaiian vacations. 
Another showed off collections of designers Christian Dior and Giorgio Armani. 
There was also an investigation into whether delicate Japanese bonsai trees can 
survive in Moscow homes.  
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's ads come from Western companies including Panasonic, Bose and 
RJR Nabisco. It even scatters English words, printed in the Latin alphabet, 
throughout its Russian Cyrillic text. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grigoriev explains that Russian lacks the equivalents of such words as 
"style," "promotion," "contributors" and "features." 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag, too, is distinctly un-Russian. Imperial's first bimonthly 
issue, which is about to hit newsstands, will sell for $5 a copy, with 50,000 
issues printed. Future press runs depend on the success of the magazine's 
agreement with BBDO, which plans a cooperative effort to fill Imperial's pages 
with snazzy ads.  
</P>
<P>
 Domovoi, a bimonthly similar to Imperial, was introduced last autumn by 
Moscow's Commersant Publishing House. Commersant, one of Russia's leading media 
companies, produces the pre-Revolutionary journal of the same name, which was 
revived in 1990 and is now considered must reading for Russians in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than having to start from scratch, Domovoi will be given free of charge 
to Commersant's 25,000 daily subscribers. Domovoi draws much of its staff from 
Commersant, with which it shares offices in a refurbished school.  
</P>
<P>
 Domovoi, named for a mythical elf that allegedly guards each Russian home, 
aims to provide practical advice on how to spend money "to the greatest 
satisfaction," according to its pilot issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magazine is for the nouveaux riches. They got rich a week ago, a month 
ago, and want to know what to do with their money," Igor Svinarenko, one of 
Domovoi's editors, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Svinarenko added that Domovoi hopes to reteach skills that atrophied during 
Soviet rule. "We were a classless society. Under communism, no one ever needed 
to know, say, how to talk to a maid. But now our readers need to talk to their 
maids, and it's not clear how they're supposed to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Domovoi's 98-page pilot issue contained one article exploring the new suburbs 
popping up around Moscow, discussing the pros and cons of each new community. 
Another feature described Russia's growing New Age movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers also learned how to get a credit card from Russian banks that have 
started issuing Visa and MasterCard. A section called the "Yellow Pages" 
offered classified advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Imperial, Domovoi has its sprinkling of English words, also often printed 
in Latin script.  
</P>
<P>
 Both magazines are printed in Finland, and neither seems to mind competition. 
Imperial's editor, in fact, says the two publications will complement each 
other.

MEDIA; PUBLISHERS REACHING OUT TO NOUVEAUX READERS; A SMALL PARIS PAPER PACKED 
WITH GRAFICS AND SHORT ARTICLES IS A HIT WITH YUPPIES.

<TEXT>
<P>
 As with so many good ideas in France, this one was born over dinner. Four 
friends, all collectors of first-edition newspapers, asked each other: What 
type of newspaper would they most like to read? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, they concluded, it would have to be a paper with news . No commentary. 
No political slant. Only a little advertising. And lots of short articles and 
colorful graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, a newspaper like no other in France. 
</P>
<P>
 That dream paper, InfoMatin, is on the streets now, its 24 pages more 
colorful, its size smaller and its price half that of nearly every other daily 
on the crowded news racks. And, in just a matter of days, it has become one of 
the country's better-selling dailies, shaking some of the long-accepted 
conventions of French newspapering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make ourselves very different from other papers," said 
Geraldine Sartin, 29, one of InfoMatin's 30 reporters. "We give the news, 
explain what it means and that's it. No commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shorter sentences, shorter stories, but not shorter ideas," she added. 
"What's wrong with that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing at all, apparently. The paper, whose name means Morning News, debuted 
on Jan. 10, with national sales of 345,000 and the biggest circulation of any 
daily in Paris. Since then, sales have leveled off at about 195,000 -- nearly 
twice what it needs, the paper's officials say, to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 French newspapers have long been famous -- some say notorious -- for serving 
their news salted heavily with opinion, a repast that French readers have come 
to accept. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading national morning paper, Le Figaro, with daily sales of 380,000, 
has an unabashed fondness for the conservative prime minister. Balancing Le 
Figaro on the newsstands is the left-leaning tabloid Liberation, with about 
half the circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the founders of InfoMatin, which is financially supported by the venerable 
intellectual French daily Le Monde, contend that the French press has lost 
touch with its readers. And the figures suggest they may have a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper circulation has been in decline for some time. More and more people 
get their news from radio and television. Only one in 10 people buys a 
newspaper today, according to recent studies. Readership has fallen even among 
the most highly educated people, less than a quarter of whom now read a 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 It was for those non-readers, most of them young urban professionals, that 
InfoMatin was created. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, it would have been impossible to publish this kind of paper," 
said Marc Jezegabel, InfoMatin's 37-year-old editor in chief. "But now we are 
meeting the expectations of the younger readers. They want something with no 
political color." 
</P>
<P>
 Other newspaper editors and publishers, facing falling circulation and 
advertising revenues, are watching InfoMatin's gamble warily. 
</P>
<P>
 Of more than a dozen daily newspapers in Paris today, the youngest is 
Liberation, which was founded 21 years ago. And the country's history is 
littered with newspaper failures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for competitors' concern is InfoMatin's price. The paper is selling 
for 3 francs, about 50 U.S. cents, less than the price of un cafe . Liberation 
and Le Figaro each cost twice that much. Le Parisien, a popular, working-class 
tabloid, recently launched a 60-cent national version called Aujourd'hui 
(Today). 
</P>
<P>
 "InfoMatin is very professional, and it does what it does perfectly," said the 
head of another Paris daily, who asked not to be named. "But I think their 
concept is completely mad." 
</P>
<P>
 "People buy a newspaper to get more than they get through TV or radio," the 
newspaperman added. "In that paper, you don't get much more. It won't last." 
</P>
<P>
 Alain Schott, 33, one of the co-founders, said it's probably too early to 
claim that InfoMatin is a success. But the sales figures "certainly are a big 
victory for the daily press," he said. "We have shown there is still a 
curiosity out there for the press. The press is not dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, total newspaper purchases in Paris have soared, by nearly 50%, since 
InfoMatin's debut. And the other major newspapers appear to be holding their 
readers in the face of InfoMatin's challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are filling a void that was created by the other papers," said Alain 
Carlier, another of the founders and now president of the company that 
publishes InfoMatin. "Those papers are unattractive, their stories are too 
long, they don't have practical information and they're too expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think we have any competition," Carlier added. "We are creating a 
new market." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the paper's success may be its marketing campaign, the largest 
ever undertaken to launch a new newspaper. Across France, InfoMatin occupies 
117,000 billboards -- about twice the number used in the typical launch of a 
new car line. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper's slogans, if not necessarily the newspaper, have been read by 
nearly every person in France. The most popular is "Toute l'Info, Rien que 
l'Info." All the News, Nothing but the News. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even on the newsstand, InfoMatin looks different from most of the other French 
dailies. It is smaller than a tabloid, only about an inch bigger than the size 
of a letter, and printed on whiter paper, similar to that used by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 The front page features the paper's name, written in two shades of blue; one 
or more large color photographs, and headlines and synopses of eight to 10 of 
the stories contained inside. The articles inside are short, ranging from brief 
paragraphs to a couple of hundred words, though a two-page section is devoted 
to one topic. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the paper, advertising is intentionally limited to just 12%, compared 
to more than 50% in most American newspapers. The owners say they can make a 
profit with that amount of advertising and a circulation of 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That could protect the paper from one of the biggest threats to the industry. 
In the last two years, advertising revenues for French papers have fallen 25%, 
and another 10% drop is expected this year due to the recession.

 InfoMatin's newsroom is located in the southeast Paris suburb of 
Ivry-sur-Seine, occupying one floor in a building owned by Le Monde. 
</P>
<P>
 InfoMatin's editors and reporters brush off suggestions that the paper is a 
"popular" tabloid, such as the crime sheets that appeal to some readers in 
Paris. Rather, they see InfoMatin as a shorter, more colorful version of their 
patron, Le Monde, a gray, hugely respected afternoon daily given to lengthy 
analysis of domestic and international issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not fast food," said Jezegabel, the editor. "It is fast, but there is 
a lot to read. And we are based on serious news. There's not one important bit 
of news that is not in the newspaper every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlier, InfoMatin's president and an administrative officer at Le Monde for 
20 years, said that when Le Monde's editor read the InfoMatin prototype, he 
jokingly suggested that a line be added to the bottom of each page. It would 
say: "For further information, see Le Monde this afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 "The editors at Le Monde are very proud of us," Carlier said.

CULTURE; HERMITAGE SINKING UNDER LAX SECURITY; RUSSIA'S FAMOUS ART MUSEUM IS 
PILLAGED BY VANDALS AND WORKERS ALIKE AND UNDERMINED BY RIVERBANK SOIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the world's greatest museums was nearly destroyed a few months ago by a 
forgotten cup of tea. 
</P>
<P>
 A worker in the fabric section of the Hermitage's Russian History Department 
had plugged in an electric tea kettle but then forgot about it. The water 
boiled away, the kettle burned up, the curtains caught fire, and suddenly the 
Hermitage -- home of Rembrandt and Rodin, Matisse and Manet, Scythian gold and 
Egyptian sarcophagi -- was in mortal danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The alarm and sprinkler system wasn't yet fully installed -- it still isn't -- 
so no warning sounded as flames crept closer to a dress owned by Czarina 
Catherine the Great. Smoke pouring from the window finally alerted a passerby; 
luckily, he was a former museum security officer and knew whom to call. Museum 
firefighters quickly put out the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-finished sprinkler system did eventually work, but for no good. It 
kicked on without cause one night, pouring more than 100 tons of water into the 
newly restored Hermitage Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Both events underline what many specialists here call a disgracefully lax 
security system for the Hermitage's wondrous 3-million-piece art collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps just as alarming about the two mishaps is how the museum's leadership 
reacted. 
</P>
<P>
 For Alexander Baturin, head of security at the Hermitage, the fire is proof 
that all is working wonderfully. Baturin proudly states that "one of our guys" 
noticed the smoke and called it in smartly. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhail Piotrovsky, director of the Hermitage, has a different take. He 
accuses the press of sensationalizing the fire. Never mind that the incident 
has been mentioned in print just once in Russia, at the bottom of a 
39-paragraph story in the St. Petersburg Bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the sprinkler malfunction, well, Piotrovsky explains, that's Finland's 
fault. The sprinkler system is Finnish-made and Finnish-installed, he says, "so 
this has been a lesson to us, a reminder that the West brings us as much bad as 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Others concerned about security at the Hermitage say Piotrovsky shoulders much 
of the blame himself. The testimony of current and former museum workers, 
police officers and cultural officials suggests that -- despite its proud 
history -- the Hermitage is no longer capable of caring for its treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Hermitage is a complex of stately buildings strung along the banks of the 
Neva River. At its core is the czar's 535-room Winter Palace. In summer, about 
30,000 people a day wander down its miles of halls to view one of the world's 
finest collections of Western painting. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum was founded in 1764 by Catherine the Great, who collected European 
art for her "hermitage" -- a cozy, private room closed off from the rest of the 
palace. Later the Bolsheviks swelled the museum's assets by nationalizing 
hundreds of private collections after the 1917 Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Famous for its Rembrandts, the museum also boasts at least 25 major works by 
Henri Matisse and 30 by Pablo Picasso. Many of those works hang in direct 
sunlight, fading. Although in czarist days sunlight was filtered with colored 
paper glued onto the Hermitage's windowpanes, not even that primitive 
precaution is taken today. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum also lacks air conditioning, and in summer the upper-story windows 
are thrown open. Paintings are exposed to cool breezes thick with humidity from 
the bordering Neva River and car exhaust from nearby Nevsky Prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 Basements are undermined by flooding and long-forgotten tunnels and drainage 
systems, some 250 years old.  
</P>
<P>
 "Do you feel how damp this wall is?" asked engineer Tatyana Yakusheva during a 
tour of the subterranean rooms and corridors. "Think about it: This humidity 
creeps upward along this wall to the pictures above. Meanwhile, this wetness -- 
these stalactites, pools of water, this damp air -- it's eating away the 
foundations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hermitage is actually sinking, at a rate of a half-centimeter a year, into 
ground that grows more sodden with the passing of each season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finnish government has promised to help with $100,000, while the Hermitage 
has put up $120,000 for Yakusheva to solve the water problems. Moreover, the 
Dutch government, in an agreement brokered by UNESCO, has pledged the Hermitage 
$1.2 million over the next 10 years for modernization and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "But although that sounds generous and impressive, most of that money is just 
a promise for now," Yakusheva said. "This is a project that can't wait for 
paperwork." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is that security problem.  
</P>
<P>
 Guards stationed in the display halls are almost all elderly women; the salary 
is too low to attract anyone else. Some doze at their posts while vandals pry 
crystal and metal details off the luxurious furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 In October 1992, when two 18th-Century crystal flagons worth $18,000 each were 
stolen from a display cabinet, it was a visitor to the museum -- not an 
employee -- who first noticed. Last summer, when auditors from the Ministry of 
Culture removed a painting from the wall, intentionally tripping the alarm, no 
one arrived to check on it for eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous known major theft at the Hermitage occurred in 1991, when a 
marble sculpture of Dionysus, valued at tens of thousands of dollars, 
disappeared from its display case. Police discovered the statue in the baggage 
check room of Vitebsky Train Station, and the thief -- a recently hired 
security guard -- was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yulia Andreyeva, a crime reporter for the St. Petersburg Bulletin, has 
catalogued dozens of petty thefts, the latest being the disappearance of a 
crystal pendant from a chandelier in the exhibit called "The Century of 
Catherine II." The reporter is aided by letters from the museum's ardent fans. 
</P>
<P>
 One letter was signed E.M., who has led tours at the Hermitage for 19 years. 
"In the Ministerial Corridor of the Winter Palace, bronze details have 
disappeared from the marble figures," the letter says. "There are some large 
mosaic cabinets there, and medallions have (also) been pried off and stolen 
from them. Once security guards stood there, but not today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same in the Rembrandt Hall. There's a chair on the left coming into 
the room. There were medallions of (different) types of stone (on that chair); 
now there are hardly any left." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers of the Dzerzhinsky neighborhood police precinct, where the Hermitage 
is located, have urged the museum to tighten security. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts show that in the Hermitage the security regime is flagrantly 
violated by the very people charged with guarding the museum," they wrote in a 
report last April to Piotrovsky and the Russian government. "There is an 
absence of necessary control by the (museum) leadership for discipline. If the 
faults noted above are not hereafter eliminated, the theft of valuables will 
continue." 
</P>
<P>
 Piotrovsky's reaction to the report was curt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police should search for thieves. That's their job. As to what we should 
do, that should be indicated by a special commission" of the Ministry of 
Culture, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a commission audited the museum recently. Among the recommendations: new 
policies on inventory and storage, a tighter museum pass system, better control 
over who has keys to various rooms and "development of the concept of 
'Hermitage Security,' on the basis of centralized administration, strict 
division of duties and coordinated activity between all departments." 
</P>
<P>
 What prompted such sweeping condemnation? Employees are tight-lipped -- with 
the notable exception of Irina Printsova, a petite 59-year-old former security 
guard. Women of her generation make up the front line of the museum's security 
system. Shod in bathroom slippers, often dozing in their chairs, they are 
stationed in almost every hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Baturin refused to extend Printsova's contract because he wants to build a 
team of younger and more energetic guards. However, finding someone more 
energetic than Printsova would be tough. When Baturin, 62, fired her, she 
challenged him to a race through the Hermitage stairwells, with the condition 
that she could keep her job if she won. Baturin declined. Printsova is suing 
for her job back. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at the Hermitage are horrified at how slack security has become, 
Printsova said, but are afraid to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much unemployment in Russia now, and in the cultural fields 
unemployment is much, much worse," she said. "At the Hermitage, people are 
clinging to their jobs in terror." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Printsova, a self-admitted busybody, has documented her case against the 
Hermitage and intends to take it to UNESCO, which works closely with the 
museum. "While others went shopping, I spent my work breaks wandering the halls 
of the Hermitage, and if I saw something wrong I reported it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw other workers asleep at their posts, and I reported them. But they keep 
those people and they fire me. Why? Because I'm a nuisance. Because I don't 
keep quiet and doze off in my chair." 
</P>
<P>
 Three times, Printsova said, she has caught tourists creating a fire hazard by 
smoking around stacks of crates containing art. Other times, construction 
workers have been caught drinking on the job or in the museum after hours -- a 
hazard to the sensitive renovations they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We write down in a journal who arrived when and who left when," she said. 
"I've seen workers crawl out of here on their hands and knees. They're so drunk 
they can't even tell me their names. Once I wrote just that: 'Too drunk to 
identify himself, left on hands and knees.' No one ever read it. I don't even 
know why we keep that book."

JIM MURRAY: SUPER BOWL XXVII: BUFFALO BILLS VS. DALLAS COWBOYS; IT'S TOUGH TO 
DEAL WITH IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oh, no! Not again! Not them ! 
</P>
<P>
 What did we do to deserve this?! 
</P>
<P>
 Listen! When you go to the movies, do you want to see the faithful sidekick 
get the girl? Want to see John Wayne losing the war? Want a leading lady with 
buck teeth? A serial where the hero really does fall off a cliff? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Buffalo Bills in the Super Bowl is cut from the same script. It's 
not even an adult western, an anti-hero flick. It's baggy-pants comedy. A part 
for the Three Stooges, the Keystone Kops. Charlie Chaplin Goes to the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 They should carry a cane and have shoes too big with holes in them and a dirty 
derby and torn clothes. They do a pratfall every year. But they keep coming 
back for more. It's a cartoon.  
</P>
<P>
 Every year, it's like going to answer a knock on the door and there stands 
your mother-in-law with her suitcase in hand. The Bills are America's 
mother-in-law.  
</P>
<P>
 The price of Super Bowl tickets just took a nose-dive. In addition to 
everything else, the game is a rerun. I mean, didn't we see this plot last 
year? 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the matchups we could have had in the Super Bowl, this one is the least 
dramatic. Hey, we could have had Joe Montana against his old team and Steve 
Young. We could have had an all-Texas shootout at the OK Corral -- Houston vs. 
Dallas. Billy the Kid vs. Wyatt Earp.  
</P>
<P>
 What do we get? The same old story. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Bills have gone to three consecutive Super Bowls. The cumulative 
score is Buffalo 60, NFC teams 109.  
</P>
<P>
 Can't we get an injunction? A restraining order? 
</P>
<P>
 The other big losers in Super Bowls are the Minnesota Vikings and Denver 
Broncos. But their record of 0-4 is very likely to be tied this week. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what Minnesota's gimmick was, but Denver's trick was to get its 
opponents in the rarefied Colorado mile-high altitude. The Broncos would lose 
maybe one game every two years in the mountains. Then they'd get down to sea 
level and turn into pumpkins. They lost Super Bowl games 42-10 and 55-10. They 
weren't games, they were track meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo's gimmick was to get its opponents at zero degrees. While they were 
blowing on their fingers or trying to keep icicles from forming, Buffalo ran up 
the score. When the Bills got to Pasadena or Tampa, they thawed out. In 
Buffalo, they were the Abominable Snowman. In Pasadena, a puddle on the Rose 
Bowl floor.  
</P>
<P>
 They're the kind of guests, when you see them coming, you lock the doors and 
turn out the lights and pretend you're not home.  
</P>
<P>
 But enough carping. They know they're not America's Team. Their fans hung out 
a sign "We're Back! Deal With It America!"  
</P>
<P>
 OK, let's deal with it. The score last year was -- what? Dallas 52, Buffalo 
17? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what we have to do: Play the Pollyanna. Write copy like: 
</P>
<P>
 "The mighty Buffalo Bills, who fell only 35 points short of winning their 
first Super Bowl game in three tries last year, brought a smile to every fan's 
face when they qualified for their fourth straight chance this year. Their win 
caused dancing in the streets as far away as Tonawanda and Olean with some 
sporadic cheering in Utica.  
</P>
<P>
 "An official at City Hall told Channel 2 that the rumor someone had asked the 
team to remove 'Buffalo' from their logo and substitute the 'Bad News Bills' 
was not true.  
</P>
<P>
 "The city did recommend to the league a series of changes for this game that 
might be in order: 
</P>
<P>
 "1. Buffalo would need only five yards for a first down while Dallas would 
need at least the standard 10 -- and if ahead at the half, at least 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "2. Touchdowns would count only three points if scored by Dallas but nine if 
scored by the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "3. Dallas' quarterback would be required to throw passes left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 "4. If the Buffalo quarterback is sacked three or more times, he is entitled 
to football's version of the penalty kick -- in other words, the Cowboys are 
taken off the field and Jim Kelly gets a free throw for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "5. Emmitt Smith is required to play in leg chains, and after he has carried 
the ball or caught the ball five times, he is ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 "6. Michael Irvin has to run pass patterns backward. 
</P>
<P>
 "7. Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson must wear a muzzle or go read a whole bunch of 
Tom Landry sayings. 
</P>
<P>
 "8. Cowboy owner Jerry Jones has to furnish Buffalo owner Ralph Wilson with a 
complete copy of the Dallas playbook with all the plays and the order in which 
they will be called. " 
</P>
<P>
 If none of this works, well, it just goes to show you the Bills' motto is 
probably correct: If at first you don't succeed, you probably never will.

BODY IDENTIFIED AS THAT OF MISSING JOCKEY HANSEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A badly decomposed body found last week on a levee near the San Mateo Bridge 
in Northern California was identified Monday as that of Ron Hansen, the jockey 
who has been missing for more than three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Confirmation that the body was Hansen's came from the Alameda County sheriff's 
office after a comparison of dental records. The body was discovered by a truck 
driver last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen, who would have been 34 on Jan. 5, had been missing since an early 
morning accident on the bridge on Oct. 2. Hansen's white English sports car was 
reported to be traveling at speeds of 100 m.p.h. when it rear-ended another car 
in the eastbound lane. The other car flipped over, causing minor injuries to 
the occupants, while Hansen's car continued about a mile on the bridge before 
stopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hansen's car was headed in the direction of his home in Alameda, he 
had called his wife, Renee, about an hour before the accident to say that he 
would be spending the night with friends on the San Mateo side of the bridge. 
Hansen was reported missing the next day after he failed to report to ride at 
Bay Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Apperson, supervising coroner for Alameda County, said Monday that a cause 
of death would not be known for three to six weeks. Det. Frank Daley of the 
Hayward police said that an investigation into Hansen's death would be based on 
the autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks as though the body had been under water all this time," Daley said. 
"We have no idea what the cause of death might be. Until we get the coroner's 
report, everything's in the realm of speculation." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen's body was found about a quarter of a mile from the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make sense that he would have attempted suicide," said Randy 
Keenan, a sergeant with the Alameda police. "There's only about a 10-foot drop 
from that end of the bridge, and the water in that area is only between two and 
eight feet deep." 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan said that nothing in his investigation indicated that Hansen had been 
murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we can tell, he received no threats," Keenan said. "We've found 
nobody that had an ax to grind. There's been nothing that would link this to 
foul play." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and relatives of Hansen were disappointed that his body was not found 
sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Coast Guard went over that area, and so did Cal Trans," Keenan said. "All 
I can think is that maybe they did their searches too soon, before the body 
wound up where it was. As it was, the body was hardly visible. If the truck 
driver hadn't seen the clothing with it, I don't think he would have spotted it 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen rode more than 3,600 winners and his horses earned more than $40 
million. A native of Idaho, he broke in at tracks there in 1976 before moving 
to Canada, where he was that country's leading apprentice in 1978 and the 
third-leading apprentice in North America. The next year, he was Canada's 
leading rider. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in the 1980s, Hansen rode in California, winning five titles at 
Golden Gate Fields and Bay Meadows and leading the Los Angeles County Fair meet 
in Pomona four consecutive years. Hansen rode six winners on a card at Golden 
Gate in 1990 and in 1991 he finished with 342 winners, fifth nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen rode Video Ranger to a fourth-place finish in the Kentucky Derby in 
1990, the same year Golden Gate ruled him off the track for five weeks during a 
race-fixing investigation. Hansen was reinstated by the California Horse Racing 
Board in time to ride in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen's survivors include his wife, a 2-year-old son and his parents. Burial 
is expected to be later this week in Idaho. A memorial service is scheduled to 
be held after the races Wednesday at Bay Meadows.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII: BUFFALO BILLS VS. DALLAS COWBOYS; HE'S ALL SET TO RUN LAPSE; 
COWBOYS: AIKMAN IS CLEARED TO PLAY AFTER SUFFERING A CONCUSSION, BUT DON'T ASK 
HIM TO RECOUNT SUNDAY'S VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys were dealt the first setback of Super Bowl week Monday when 
their quarterback acknowledged that he can't use the NFC championship victory 
as inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Troy Aikman doesn't remember it. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't remember completing 14 of 18 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't remember throwing for two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't remember leading the Cowboys to a 38-21 victory over the San Francisco 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys were lucky he even showed up at their training facility Monday in 
preparation for their trip here. 
</P>
<P>
 Because, for several frightening hours after suffering a concussion Sunday, he 
didn't even remember that the Cowboys will play the Buffalo Bills in the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman spent Sunday night in a hospital undergoing a variety of tests. Doctors 
have cleared him to play next Sunday, although he will do so with a sore neck. 
</P>
<P>
 And with a new view on the fragility of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had a real fear of death, but not anymore," Aikman said. "Because 
after what happened to me yesterday, I realized, when you go, you go quick." 
</P>
<P>
 The end of Aikman's afternoon happened as quick as a knee from Dennis Brown to 
the back of Aikman's head early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran one more play, a draw to Emmitt Smith. Or so he was told. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea what I was doing . . . I guess I must have gotten the signal 
from the sidelines and put in the play, but I don't know how," Aikman said. "We 
do that play so much, maybe I can run it in my sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 When he came to the sidelines after that play, it became obvious to the 
Cowboys that he had to leave the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first clue, perhaps, was when he saw center Mark Stepnoski sitting on 
the bench in civilian clothes and asked him why he wasn't playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepnoski suffered a season-ending knee injury a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the pregame introductions, I remember throwing one ball deep to 
Alvin Harper, but I remember nothing else," Aikman said. 
</P>
<P>
 With four minutes remaining in the game, team doctors sent Aikman to the 
hospital. He was soon joined there by agent Leigh Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they spent what they agree was the longest, weirdest night of their 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a scene out of the movie, 'Rain Man,' " Steinberg said. "It's 
scary to realize how the mind's grip on memory is so fragile." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg knew things were serious a couple of hours after Aikman checked in. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden he jumps up, puts on his clothes, and tries to leave," 
Steinberg said. "He forgot why he was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman not only forgot the whys, he forgot the whos and the whats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time he remembered that he played for the Cowboys," Steinberg 
said. "But in the beginning, he thought he was still playing for Henryetta High 
in Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
 While doctors passed through Aikman's room with no answers, he began peppering 
Steinberg with questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked who he just played, and if they won, and how come there wasn't a bye 
week before the Super Bowl," he said. "He had no idea they were playing in the 
Super Bowl, and no idea it was against the Bills." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg would give the answers, but then Aikman would forget again. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, shortly after midnight, Steinberg wrote an account of the Cowboy 
victory and its ramifications -- much like a sportswriter -- on four pieces of 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 He left the papers at Aikman's bedside for his constant perusal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't even remember phone numbers," Aikman said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he finally looked at a list and saw a phone number and coach he 
recognized, he immediately called offensive coordinator Norv Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had forgotten the time. It was 12:30 a.m., and Turner's wife would not 
rouse him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aspects of it were hilarious," Steinberg said. "But aspects of it were very 
frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman phoned his mother early in the evening, then again four hours later, 
because he forgot he had called her. 
</P>
<P>
 By his reckoning, he finally came to his senses at 4 a.m., more than 12 hours 
after the original hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done a lot of things that I can't believe, and this is one of them," he 
said. "But I'm fine now. And I'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates have seen a lot of those things. Some of then must have shrugged 
Monday when hearing about his problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stuff happens," guard Nate Newton said. "The way I understand it is, you 
got all your memory in the back of your head and if you get hit there -- boom 
-- it's all gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Newton looked at a reporter and smiled. "Come over here and I can 
demonstrate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith also took a lighter view. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, man, the same thing happened to me before, but when I was hit, I wasn't 
wearing a helmet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the next play, I was running, and I went blind," he said. "I had to hold 
on to my blocker to get down the field. Serious." 
</P>
<P>
 They laugh now, but Aikman wasn't laughing Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every football player, just by playing, exposes themselves to risks that the 
rest of us would find unacceptable," Steinberg said. "This is one of those 
times when you realize just what those risks are."

SUPER BOWL XXVIII: BUFFALO BILLS VS. DALLAS COWBOYS; IT KEEPS GETTING WORSE; 
HISTORY: THE BILLS COME BACK FOR MORE AFTER THREE INCREASINGLY BAD LOSSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time, they were welcomed enthusiastically, the new guys on the block 
who offered a refreshing change. 
</P>
<P>
 The second time, they were welcomed back because they deserved another 
opportunity, the guys who had missed the winner's circle by a foot. 
</P>
<P>
 The third time, they were welcomed with some apprehension, the guys who were 
beginning to try the patience of a nation of football fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth time, they are about as welcome in Atlanta as was General Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the Buffalo Bills of the 1990s, the NFL's biggest winners and the 
Super Bowl's biggest losers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the Bills have a 58-18 record in the '90s, counting all games played, 
best mark in the league. Over that span, Buffalo has won three AFC titles and 
nine consecutive AFC playoff games since losing in 1990. But the only record 
that counts this Super Bowl week is 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere they go in Atlanta, the Bills are trying to put that record behind 
them. But everywhere they go, it is waved in their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
 How did it happen? 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo fans beware, it may be too painful to read any further. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SUPER BOWL XXV 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa, 1991 
</P>
<P>
 New York 20, Buffalo 19 
</P>
<P>
 It was a euphoric time for the Bills. They had won a club-record 13 games, 
going 13-3 to win the AFC East, then blew past both the Miami Dolphins, 44-34, 
and the Raiders, 51-3, in the AFC playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants, featuring a powerful, stifling defense, stuck their collective 
noses up at the high-powered team from that little city across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have to have seven guys break legs and everybody else come out 
totally unprepared for a team to score 51 points against us," Giant linebacker 
Pepper Johnson sneered. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's job was made easier by New York's ball-control offense, which 
maintained possession for an impressive 40 minutes 33 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, the Giants, with Jeff Hostetler at the controls, took 
the ball on their initial drive and went 75 yards in 14 plays, consuming 9:29 
before Ottis Anderson went over from a yard out. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't all Giants. Somehow, in the 19:27 in which they had the ball, 
quarterback Jim Kelly, running back Thurman Thomas and their offensive 
teammates also found time to put points on the board. The Bills totaled 371 
yards, Thomas a big part of that with 135 yards rushing and 55 yards receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the end, it came down to a field-goal attempt by Buffalo's Scott 
Norwood from 47 yards with four seconds remaining. If he had made it, the 
entire course of franchise history might have been different. 
</P>
<P>
 But he missed, wide right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Power," Giant Coach Bill Parcells said, "wins games." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SUPER BOWL XXVI 
</P>
<P>
 Minneapolis, 1992 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 37, Buffalo 24 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the war was one of words featuring several prominent Bills. Thomas 
complained about being underappreciated. Defensive line coach Chuck Dickerson 
filled up the Redskins' bulletin board by poking fun at Washington's offensive 
linemen, calling them everything from "Neanderthal" to "ugly," talking about 
one player having "bad breath" and claiming another "slobbered." 
</P>
<P>
 On a more serious note, defensive end Bruce Smith, citing racist hate mail, 
said he might leave Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy hardly ended with the opening kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The game started two plays later for Thomas than for the rest of the Bills' 
offensive unit. He spent that time looking for his helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills needed hard hats to dodge the criticism when the game had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Redskin quarterback Mark Rypien completed 18 of 33 passes for 292 yards and 
two touchdowns on a day when Washington had 417 yards in offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Down, 17-0, at the half, the Bills contributed to their own demise and helped 
seal their second consecutive Super Bowl loss on their first play of the third 
quarter. Kelly was picked off by Kurt Gouveia, who returned the ball 23 yards 
to the Buffalo two. One play later, Gerald Riggs scored to give the Redskins an 
insurmountable lead. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of negative numbers for Buffalo. Kelly was intercepted four 
times. The Bills also lost a fumble and dropped nine passes. Thomas gained only 
13 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 SUPER BOWL XXVII 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena, 1993 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 52, Buffalo 17 
</P>
<P>
 Where to begin? 
</P>
<P>
 For linebacker Darryl Talley, another Super Bowl worth forgetting was preceded 
by an incident no one seemed willing to forget. That was the mysterious run-in 
he had or didn't have in an L.A. night spot with a man who was identified as 
Magic Johnson's bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no doubt, however, about the beating Talley and his teammates took 
in the Rose Bowl on Super Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was there anything mysterious about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Any team that turns the ball over nine times figures to get beaten badly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys intercepted four passes, two from Kelly and two from Frank Reich, 
who took over when Kelly got hurt. Dallas also recovered five fumbles, the nine 
turnovers resulting in 35 Cowboy points. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas had its offensive weapons operating at peak efficiency. Troy Aikman 
threw four touchdown passes and Emmitt Smith rushed for 108 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Bills are back, hoping to write a new chapter in their history rather 
than reliving the old one again.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII: BUFFALO BILLS VS. DALLAS COWBOYS; PART COACH, PART COUCH; 
PSYCHOLOGY PLAYS IMPORTANT ROLE IN JIMMY JOHNSON'S LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Phillip Trapp, retired chairman of the University of Arkansas psychology 
department, said he couldn't say for sure if James William Johnson was "an A, 
B, C, D or F" student. 
</P>
<P>
 "But's it like I told all our psychology majors at the time," Trapp said by 
phone from Fayetteville on Monday. "Other things being equal, you should have 
an edge in dealing with people." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 38, San Francisco 21. 
</P>
<P>
 James William Johnson, who once had been more interested in Freud and Jung 
than Lombardi and Halas, had already been exposed to abnormal behavior and 
child and adolescent psychology before becoming Jimmy Johnson, the football 
coach, destined to deepen Buffalo's depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "My decision to major in psychology," Johnson wrote in his book, "Turning the 
Thing Around," "was also the decision that would eventually make the difference 
between a good Xs-to-O's college coach and a national championship coach; 
between a good, solid NFL coach and a Super Bowl coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, the aspiring industrial psychologist who passed on the pursuit of a 
master's degree to become an assistant football coach in order to pay his 
bills, has risen to the very top of his profession with an uncompromising 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll crush you like a squirrel in the road," Johnson once said when asked 
about his drive to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys won Super Bowl XXVII because Jimmy Johnson ordained it to 
be so. Emmitt Smith's contract holdout might have sabotaged their return visit 
to the Super Bowl, but complacency never had a chance against Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 While head coach at the University of Miami, Johnson's teams not only went 
five for five against opponents who were ranked No. 1 at the time, but 31-0 
against competition that had been unranked. There is no sneaking up on Jimmy 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are about to read and learn more about the egotistical, selfish coach of 
the Dallas Cowboys," Dallas Morning News columnist Frank Luksa wrote before 
this season began. "To describe Jimmy Johnson in those terms is not a 
criticism. It is to repeat his self-portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnson is bone-cutting honest on the subject of himself. He is without 
pretense. This is me, he says: a single man who likes his beer, loves his job, 
wants and needs few close pals, thinks he's a hell of a coach, knows he will 
win and doesn't mind being quoted about any of it since he's said it before." 
</P>
<P>
 The folks in Dallas, who looked upon Tom Landry's fedora as if it were part of 
the Texas landscape, have now come to know and even accept the outsider, who 
vacations in the Bahamas, doesn't believe in exchanging Christmas presents, 
hates baseball and pets, and wins football games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody in the country understands the pressure of coming to 
the Cowboys after Tom Landry," says Johnson, who makes more than $1 million per 
year and is signed through 1999. "You know deep down what the expectations are, 
and everyone is looking at you in a cockeyed way. 'Can this guy do it?' 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a long way to go here. But no one is looking at us with cocked 
eyes anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, he had the fans on their feet cheering before the game had begun, 
as he had asked them to do earlier in the week. Those who had booed him in 1989 
after guiding the Cowboys to a 1-15 mark in his first year as Landry's 
successor were now his buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Jimmy Johnson came here to coach the Cowboys, no one could be certain 
how long it would take for him to get the football team turned around," said 
Jerry Jones, a former Arkansas football teammate of Johnson's who hired him to 
coach after buying the Cowboys. "We knew we might have to have a little 
patience for a little while. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you knew Jimmy, you knew the job would somehow get done. You just 
plain knew it." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning football games is what Johnson is all about, and anything short of 
that earns a harsh response. Running back Curvin Richards fumbled twice last 
season against the Bears and was immediately cut. Linebacker John Roper fell 
asleep in a meeting, and was unemployed a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a run-up-the-score kind of guy, who was accosted by then-New York Jet 
Coach Bruce Coslet this season for blitzing and hurting quarterback Boomer 
Esiason while leading by 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's tantrums and demand for hard work in training camp garner headlines 
each July. In December, he still is yelling and prodding the players for more. 
After winning a franchise-record 13th regular-season game last season, he 
stormed off the field and went wild in the locker room because he was unhappy 
with his team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't even think for a second that I don't know what I am doing," Johnson has 
said. "Don't ever think this stuff just flows off the tip of my tongue. I 
didn't get to the point where I am today by allowing the wind to blow me left 
and right." 
</P>
<P>
 He walks through life like a man who always knows exactly where he is going, 
and there is no concern for speed bumps. He is tough, he can be charming, and 
he has been vindictive. 
</P>
<P>
 When Arkansas Athletic Director Frank Broyles passed on Johnson in 1983 and 
hired another former Razorback, Ken Hatfield, to be head coach, Johnson added 
Arkansas to Miami's schedule. And in 1987, Miami handed the Razorbacks a 51-7 
defeat, their worst loss ever in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not a good idea to let Jimmy Johnson down. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Boys," writer Skip Bayless' account of the Cowboys' 1992 run for the 
Super Bowl, he detailed Johnson's tirade on the team's return charter flight 
from Washington after a 20-17 defeat. Bayless wrote that Johnson loudly scolded 
players, ordered assistant coaches to sit down and stopped dinner service. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayless later quoted quarterback Troy Aikman about the trip: "A lot of players 
were extremely upset. (After the incident) there was just so much discussion 
and bitterness by so many guys. Here we'd done everything we could for this 
guy. We'd played our guts out, and it was only our third loss. It was like he 
sold us out." 
</P>
<P>
 If the troops were considering mutiny, they changed their minds. The Cowboys 
won their next five games, including Super Bowl XXVII, and love him or despise 
him, Johnson got his team to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't manipulate people like I would puppets," Johnson has said. 
"It's just that I like my life structured, and what I say to be structured. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really do like to think about what I say and do. I'm a rigid planner. I 
don't like shooting from the hip. Part of the reason for that is that I know 
when I'm talking to the media, I'm talking to the players and to the fans, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago he spoke to the 49ers through the media with his, "We will win and 
you can put it in three-inch headlines" outburst on the radio. Outburst? The 
man with the psychology degree had planned it all out, and while loosening up 
his own team he whipped his finesse-minded opponents into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times when players need a kick in the rear, and at other times, 
like during the playoffs last year, they need stroking. I pride myself on 
knowing when and how to react to each situation." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not Xs and O's, it's knowing people, and yet he goes through life for the 
most part as if he preferred living on an island. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't have time for other people," Johnson has said. "I don't have 
time to get close to many individuals outside the team and the staff. I think a 
lot of people perceive me (as impersonal) because I have had very little 
contact with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Determination highlights his impersonal approach to achieving success. There 
is something there that almost makes winning football games more important than 
family, friends and life beyond the videotape of next week's opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to have a rush," Johnson has said. "My whole life is an extreme. I 
live it that way on purpose. I'm either at the depths of despair or the heights 
of ecstasy. There's nothing in the middle."

HULL HAPPY BEING BLUES' SET-UP MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's a sniper to be sure, but there's so much more to Brett Hull's game than 
simply firing shots at goaltenders. 
</P>
<P>
 He's here one minute, about to be suffocated by a defenseman, and then he's 
gone in a flash. Just try to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks tried and failed Monday night at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Hull scored one goal, an almost ordinary-looking shot from the high slot that 
beat goalie Guy Hebert 3 minutes 18 seconds into the game. Ordinary because it 
looked so easy, so natural. 
</P>
<P>
 He assisted on the other two, including Kevin Miller's game-winner 1:10 into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, he set up a hard-charging Jim Montgomery with a perfect cross-ice 
pass on a two-on-one break. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, when the St. Louis Blues had rallied to defeat the Ducks, 
3-2, in overtime, somebody pressed Hull about his role as a set-up man. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're just as happy setting up goals as scoring them?" the reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Hull said. "Winning is all that matters, though." 
</P>
<P>
 So Hull moves in a relentless blur across the ice, seeing open teammates and 
getting them the puck. He won the game for the Blues simply by giving up the 
puck. 
</P>
<P>
 You know he can score goals. No one with 31 goals in 45 games walks quietly 
into an opponent's arena without notice taken. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hull worked his magic by feeding Montgomery and then Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a pass through center and I grabbed it," Hull said of the Blues' 
second goal. "Jimmy just went hard to the net." 
</P>
<P>
 All Montgomery had to do was put his stick out. The puck glanced off his stick 
and into the net. Goal. And a 2-2 tie with almost 18 minutes left in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 In overtime, Hull cruised through the Duck defense until he found Miller, who 
was too close to miss. Hebert, Hull's former teammate, never had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Another goal and a St. Louis victory that wouldn't have been possible without 
Hull. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's winning that drives him, then? 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit of excellence perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 Both are highly likely, but Hull insisted Monday that it boils down to one 
human emotion: Fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Not from any outside source, mind you. It's all from within, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fear of never scoring again is what drives me," he said. "I wake up with 
the fear of God in me every morning. That's what motivates me."

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; THREE OF LAST SEASON'S FINAL FOUR SEEM READY TO RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All four of last spring's playoff semifinalists struggled during the first 
half of this season. But whereas the Kings, Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal 
Canadiens appear poised to regroup after the All-Star break, the New York 
Islanders are sinking deeper into the depths of the Atlantic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries brought the Maple Leafs down to earth after their record 10-0 start. 
They were 11-14-7 over the next two months and only recently bounced back with 
a 6-0-2 streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every team is going to go through a slump, but we've been picking it up the 
last couple of weeks," said goaltender Felix Potvin, who shook off a personal 
lull and led Toronto's revival. "We know it's a long season. Nobody was 
worried." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, who defeated Toronto in last year's Campbell Conference final, were 
eight games under .500 through Dec. 23. They have shown recent signs of life, 
but they're still not sure of a Western Conference playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a successful season, we and Montreal had two months off, and in that 
time you tend to forget why you were successful," King Coach Barry Melrose 
said. "Other teams are hungrier, too. Chicago and Boston are more motivated 
after (not getting far in the playoffs) last season. But we're playing a lot 
better and Montreal is playing a lot better, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries and disappointing performances by Pierre Turgeon and Ron Hextall have 
left the Islanders 12th in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to say it, but we are exactly where we belong," General Manager 
Don Maloney said. "Every one of the players who has put on the uniform this 
year should be embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 Fatigue and a tinge of complacency were the Canadiens' problems. They endured 
a 2-5-2 stretch in December and are a mediocre 14-10-2 at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see maybe after winning the Stanley Cup, it's tough for the players to 
get back on track," Coach Jacques Demers said. "The players felt empty when the 
season was over because it was very long and they were tired mentally. They 
also had a very demanding summer. But I think we're playing better now. We're 
holding teams to 24, 25 shots a game and we're playing the way we were playing 
last spring." 
</P>
<P>
 Said goalie Patrick Roy: "Guys came back not in as good shape as they were 
last year and we struggled. . . . Jacques asked the guys to go back to what 
made us so successful last year, playing solid on defense, and we're doing 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Demers hopes the Kings and Canadiens will rebound to stage a rematch of last 
year's Stanley Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Barry Melrose. He's a good friend and I don't want to see him suffer," 
Demers said. "They've got Wayne Gretzky, who's having a Gretzky year, so you 
can't count them out." WEARING OF THE GREEN 
</P>
<P>
 Given a chance to enhance his team's public image, owner Norm Green of the 
Dallas Stars instead chose to enhance his bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stars recently sold a stockpile of jerseys and equipment left over from 
their previous incarnation as the Minnesota North Stars. It was a perfect 
opportunity to help local charities or youth hockey programs. Nope. Green kept 
the proceeds, saying the income would help recoup expenses for new equipment 
the Stars had to buy when they moved. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the man who wants the city of Dallas to build him a new arena. Let's 
hope city officials remember his lack of generosity when he comes around for a 
handout. LEAVING ON A JET PLANE 
</P>
<P>
 The dismissal of Winnipeg General Manager Mike Smith was no surprise. Although 
he is considered one of the NHL's brightest executives and an authority on 
Russian hockey affairs, his trades largely misfired and left the Jets with a 
soft and plodding defense. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that trading Dave Ellett to Toronto for Mark Osborne and Ed 
Olczyk did "irreparable damage" to the Jets' defense, and that's true. They 
have no reliable, experienced backliners besides Stephane Quintal and Teppo 
Numminen, and since trading Phil Housley, they have no one who can move the 
puck up quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith also dealt Bryan Marchment and Peter Taglianetti for next to nothing and 
alienated goalie Bob Essensa by withdrawing a contract offer last November. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paddock, Winnipeg's coach and interim general manager, maintains that the 
playoffs are still within reach. That he's right is a sad commentary on the 
quality of play this season. WHEELS AND DEALS 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit Red Wings are still looking for a trustworthy playoff goalie, and 
word is they have set their sights on Calgary's Mike Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
 Every other piece has fallen into place for Scotty Bowman, who is within three 
victories of becoming the first NHL coach to total 1,000 regular-season and 
playoff victories. Sergei Fedorov continues to dazzle, Paul Coffey is in high 
gear, the power play ranks second in the league and the defense has improved. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bowman isn't entirely comfortable with Tim Cheveldae, who was horrible 
last spring against Toronto. The Flames, blessed with Trevor Kidd and the 
promising Andrei Trefilov in goal, can afford to deal Vernon. NUMBERS GAME 
</P>
<P>
 As the NHL had hoped, a close All-Star game produced decent TV ratings. 
Saturday's 9-8 East Conference victory drew an overnight rating of 3.5 on NBC, 
up 6% over last year's 16-6 Wales Conference rout. The ratings, which measure 
viewership in 29 U.S. markets, included a 3.2 in Los Angeles, a 3.6 in New York 
and a high of 7.3 in Philadelphia. Complete national ratings are due Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ratings held throughout the three hours, which means people stayed with 
it because it was exciting and compelling," said Stephen Solomon, the NHL's 
senior vice president and chief operating officer. "We're happy." SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Gordie Howe, who followed Gretzky for several games so he could be present 
when the King center broke his record for points, might not be on the scene 
when Gretzky breaks his record of 801 goals. "He took one extra game and I 
couldn't get to see the grandchildren," Howe said. "He'll do it on his own. His 
dad is feeling better (after suffering a ruptured aneurysm), so Walter 
(Gretzky) can follow him around." 
</P>
<P>
 New York Ranger right wing Mike Gartner used the All-Star break to have bone 
chips removed from his right elbow in an arthroscopic procedure. He probably 
will sit out only four games. . . . Forget the Marty McSorley trade rumors. 
Mario Lemieux told the Pittsburgh Penguins he wants McSorley around to protect 
him when he returns from his back injury. Lemieux said he hopes to be back by 
early February. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit's Steve Yzerman has at least one point in each of the 12 games he has 
played since coming back from a neck injury. . . . Draft prospect Jason 
Bonsignore plays for Niagara Falls of the Ontario Hockey League and not the 
University of Michigan, as reported in this column last week.

TYSON, PROSECUTORS ARE SAID TO BE WORKING ON RELEASE DEAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Tyson would admit raping Desiree Washington in exchange for his early 
release from prison under a proposed deal with Marion County prosecutors, 
WTHR-TV reported Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It said a willingness of both sides to negotiate might be linked to the fact 
that the Indiana Court of Appeals has granted the former heavyweight champion a 
hearing to consider whether the prosecutor's office withheld important 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 WTHR said neither side was talking publicly about the deal, and it did not 
disclose its sources for the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson's attorney, Alan Dershowitz, speaking from his home in the Boston area, 
said: "I've had no discussions (with the prosecutor's office). I am going ahead 
and preparing for the hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Smith, a spokesman for Prosecutor Jeffrey Modisett, could not be reached 
for comment late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson was convicted of assaulting Washington, a contestant in the Miss Black 
America pageant in Indianapolis, in July of 1991. He is serving a six-year term 
at the Indiana Youth Center in Plainfield, 15 miles west of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 WTHR also reported that attorneys for Tyson and Washington are discussing an 
out-of-court settlement of their civil case.

LIFE HAS BEEN ANYTHING BUT EASY; CLIPPERS: DESPITE HIS NICKNAME, ROOKIE ELLIS 
HAS HAD DIFFICULTY PROVING HIS ABILITY SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rookie Clipper forward Harold Ellis was nicknamed "Easy" by his childhood 
buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made everything look easy," said Rico Adkins, who grew up with Ellis in 
northwest Atlanta. "We called him Easy Ellis or Easy E." 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't easy for Ellis to reach the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have the easy way to the NBA, from star in high school to star in 
college to the first round (in the NBA draft)," said Ellis, 23. "Some people 
have to just get there the hard way, and I took the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't recommend a lot of people taking the hard route. Hey, if you can, 
be a star the whole way through. But I think that you will appreciate it more 
with the hard work and I think it will prepare you better in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis was cut from the Frederick Douglass High basketball team three years in 
a row, finally pleading with the coach to put him on the team as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got cut my sophomore year because the coach said I didn't have the skills 
to play high school basketball, but I wasn't disappointed because I figured if 
I worked hard I'd make it the next year," Ellis said. "When I was cut my junior 
year, I knew I only had one more shot at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis' mother, Mary, told him not to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he could play," she said. "After he kept getting cut, I told him to 
keep playing recreational ball and do other things. He was first alto sax in 
the marching band and played on the chess team." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis tried out again as a senior, but was cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was ready my senior year, and after I got cut I went home crying," 
Ellis said. "That's the year that hurt me the most. But I asked the coach just 
to let me wear the jersey. He let me be on the team, but he told me that he 
probably wouldn't play me because he had to get the other guys scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the first semester, we had two guys (declared academically 
ineligible) and I moved up to 16th man. We'd be beating people by 40 points and 
I'd get in with 10 or 15 seconds left. It was embarrassing. But I was happy to 
be there." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ellis became the team's top reserve during the state tournament, and 
helped Frederick Douglass High reach the semifinals in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coach apologized to me after the season because he realized he'd made a 
mistake by not playing me more," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis then went to Morehouse College in Atlanta, the alma mater of the late 
Martin Luther King and Olympic gold medalist Edwin Moses, on an ROTC 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, whose parents are both principals at Atlanta elementary schools, 
stressed education over basketball, making the dean's list at Morehouse and 
graduating on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know they had a basketball team, but I found out they had a team and 
when I went out for the team I went up to dunk and tore down the rim in my 
first practice," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was voted to the all-conference team four years in a row and was the 
conference MVP his last two seasons. However, he wasn't drafted after attending 
the NBA pre-draft camp in Chicago and playing well at several postseason 
all-star games in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think it was fair because I thought I outplayed some of the guys," 
Ellis said. "But I just knew that I had to prove myself again. 
</P>
<P>
 "People back home told me that I should quit playing basketball and start 
graduate school when I didn't get drafted." 
</P>
<P>
 He did begin graduate school, but he didn't give up trying to make the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 He was invited to play for the Utah Jazz in a summer league but wasn't invited 
to the Jazz training camp and played for the Quad City (Moline, Ill.) Thunder 
in the Continental Basketball Assn. last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the year, the coach said in a newspaper article that three guys 
on the team were ready for the NBA, but that I would definitely be back in the 
CBA because I needed another year," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept that article on my wall because I thought it was an insult." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis looked at the article for inspiration every day last summer and worked 
with a personal coach to improve his shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Invited to the Clippers' training camp last October after having played well 
in the Los Angeles Summer League, Ellis' work ethic impressed the players and 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hate me in practice because I go hard," Ellis said. "But believe it or 
not, it helps the other guys to get better to have somebody out there going 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis had 25 points in the Clippers' exhibition opener against the Golden 
State Warriors, but he didn't play much after that and was the final player cut 
before the season opened. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to Quad City, where he had to earn his job back. But he played 
well, averaging 21.4 points, six rebounds and 2.9 steals in 21 games and was 
selected to play in the CBA All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with the Clippers in the midst of a seven-game losing streak, Ellis was 
signed again on Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Quad City Coach Dan Panaggio pulled Ellis aside before practice on Jan. 6 and 
told him that he was being removed from the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it, but then he told me that I was being taken out of the 
starting lineup because I was going to Los Angeles to play for the Clippers," 
Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried, because it was a dream come true. I thought of all the work I'd put 
in and all the people who told me I'd never make it. I almost gave up in high 
school because the coaches would just run me and work me and then not play me. 
But my mom told me never to give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis has impressed Clipper Coach Bob Weiss with his tenacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's only got one speed, which is fifth gear," Weiss said. "I never dreamed 
he'd get this many points, but that's what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 During the closing moments of a 21-point loss at New York on Jan 11, Ellis was 
assessed a flagrant foul after an altercation with Knick forward Eric Anderson. 
Ellis was fined $3,500 by the NBA, so he didn't get his first paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was worth it because I was playing hard," Ellis said. "I look at it like 
this: The money will always come, but I was doing something for the team. 
Somebody had to do something for the team, because the Knicks were just beating 
us up and I wanted to let them know that they weren't going to beat us and then 
beat us up." 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring 23 points in 27 minutes as a reserve in a 19-point loss the next 
night at Philadelphia, Ellis started his first NBA game against the Boston 
Celtics at the Boston Garden on Jan 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so nervous that whole day that I couldn't eat," Ellis said. "I almost 
said, 'Why are you starting me when you have other guys here?' But I finally 
said to myself, 'If it's meant for me, I'll know tonight.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis scored a season-high 27 points and had five steals as the Clippers ended 
their losing streak. Ellis, at 6 feet 5, dunked over 7-0 Celtic center Robert 
Parish. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's fearless," Parish said of Ellis. "I like that. He plays with a lot of 
aggressiveness, and he has a big heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis has averaged 12.6 points. 3.6 rebounds and 2.4 steals in eight games 
with the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is making the NBA minimum of $150,000, he has outplayed some of 
his higher-paid teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to have one or two guys on every team who are just starving and 
who'll do anything for you, and Harold is that guy," Clipper guard Mark Jackson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clippers have several players, such as Danny Manning and Harper, 
who are eager to leave because of contract disputes, Ellis enjoys playing for 
the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you signed a contract with a team, I feel you should be obligated to that 
team," Ellis said. "You shouldn't even think, 'I want to leave.' It's hard to 
win when you start thinking like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be here. I like L.A. Why would you want to leave L.A? They gave me 
a chance, and I'll never forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I talk to kids at my dad's school, I tell them, 'Work hard and 
your dreams will come true. Don't give up, because you can make it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So many kids give up. But if you don't give up, you can make it -- because 
dreams come true." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis is living proof of that.

SERVITE EXPECTS COACH TO STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Hamilton, Servite basketball coach, probably will be reinstated after 
serving a suspension for the rest of this season, Principal Raymond Dunne said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, in his second year at Servite, was involved in an altercation with 
game officials Wednesday after the Friars' 62-61 loss to Marina at Marina High. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton was suspended Friday and assistant Kevin Reynolds became acting 
coach, Dunne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I misrepresented the school and myself," Hamilton said. "My actions 
should not be condoned by any means. I feel bad about the situation, and I wish 
I could take it back." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dunne: "Once the season is over, I fully expect him to continue with the 
program. I feel in this case a mistake was made, and Scott will learn from that 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Athletic Director Tom Vitello, there will be no ramifications 
from the incident for the Servite basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a school matter and we handled it with the suspension," Vitello said. 
"As far as the Southern Section is concerned, it's a dead issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton will continue to teach algebra at Servite. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

FOX HIRES MADDEN; SALARY COULD BE $8 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is John Madden worth $8 million per year? Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the 
Fox television network, apparently thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, it was announced Monday that Madden will be Fox's lead football 
analyst beginning next season, and sources are now saying he got a four-year, 
$32-million contract. Initially, it was reported as a $30-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 If the $32-million figure is right, he will make $325,000 per game . Few 
network analysts make that much a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fox hasn't announced it yet, Pat Summerall will join Madden at Fox 
and make about $2 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Goren, a senior producer at CBS, also will join Fox as its executive 
producer of sports, sources say. Earlier, it was reported that producer Bob 
Stenner and director Sandy Grossman, who worked with Madden and Summerall at 
CBS, will move over to Fox as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Bradshaw, appearing with Jay Leno on the "Tonight Show" Monday night, 
implied he is also going to Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some news this week," Bradshaw said. "I'm going to have a gig 
-- you could say it's the littlest network. There's a strong possibility I 
could bump into John Madden." 
</P>
<P>
 However, a source said Bradshaw may be headed for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hill, the president of Fox's new sports division, would not comment on 
future hires, saying: "This is John's day." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Madden, Hill said: "We not only wanted him, we needed him. If, as we say, 
we're going to put on the best football telecasts, then we need the best 
football analyst." 
</P>
<P>
 Madden said he met with Murdoch the night after the Cowboys and New York 
Giants closed the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Murdoch reportedly offered Madden a yearly salary $4 million. 
Later, there were reports that Madden would spurn the Fox offer in order to 
work "Monday Night Football" for ABC at $2.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, NBC made a $5 million offer to Madden. A source said half of that 
would be for serving as a spokesman for General Electric, which owns NBC. Then 
Fox doubled its offer. LARRY STEWART

DOLPHIN SALE WOULD NEED RULE WAIVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 H. Wayne Huizenga, who agreed Monday to buy the Miami Dolphins, faces 
uncertain prospects in trying to persuade the NFL to waive a longstanding rule 
against ownership of teams in other leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a slam dunk," Huizenga acknowledged at a news conference announcing 
the proposed sale.The Palm Beach Post and the Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale 
quoted unidentified sources as saying it would be for $138 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule is the biggest obstacle to league approval of the deal. Huizenga 
already owns baseball's Florida Marlins and the NHL Florida Panthers and might 
wind up with a large percentage of stock in a company bidding to control the 
parent of the New York Knicks and Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be a big change in the rule," said New Orleans Saint owner Tom 
Benson, chairman of the NFL's finance committee. "It's not going to be an easy 
task getting that done. But I'm not saying it won't get done, either." 
</P>
<P>
 The finance committee, made up of seven NFL owners, will visit with Huizenga 
before submitting a recommendation to the other 21 owners. Approval by 21 of 
the 28 owners is required to change the rule, Benson said.

SUPER BOWL / DAILY REPORT; JOHNSON PLAYS HEAD GAME ON KELLY, POINTS OUT HE 
HASN'T WON BIG ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Johnson wasted no time in resuming his head games Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the target was Buffalo Bill quarterback Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 As he did with the San Francisco 49ers' Steve Young last week, Johnson just 
happened to remind everyone that Kelly has not won a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 And the poor guy, you might think that bothers him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime a quarterback goes out there and has something hanging over his head, 
it takes away from his play," Johnson said. "I don't know if he can be as 
effective as he could be if he goes out there with total confidence. Jim Kelly 
would have much more confidence if he had a Super Bowl victory behind him." 
</P>
<P>
 How does Johnson know this? Because his players tell him, of course. "Our 
quarterback doesn't have that problem," Johnson said. "Our program doesn't have 
those problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Note his use of, "program," a word normally reserved for college coaches. 
Maybe he really is trying to turn the Cowboys into the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson also noted that his players revel in this week's media attention -- 
something that always seems to bother the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Johnson, the attention is less than surrounds the Cowboys during 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is actually easier for my guys than other times," he said, rather 
amazingly. "My big-name players, they like this week because they have to do 
fewer one-on-one interviews." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson also said that his players don't have to worry about saying anything 
outlandish. "They can say anything they want, because they know that I'll 
probably say something more absurd."  
</P>
<P>
 Unspoken was the fact that the Bills are frequently fined for outlandish 
remarks by their quiet head coach, Marv Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One difference from last year that may actually make a difference is the 
shortening of the time between the championship game and the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, with both teams having two weeks to prepare, the Cowboys were able 
to hone their timing against the Bills' no-huddle offense during practice. 
</P>
<P>
 During that same stretch, the Bills lost their timing. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, because Johnson does not want to risk injury to starters, he will 
not put together a "scout" team to simulate the no-huddle offense. 
</P>
<P>
 And that worries him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think the extra week last year helped us in preparing for an 
offensive system that is a little bit foreign," he said. "Not having that 
luxury . . . is going to be a little bit of a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Levy said that those fans who look at the Bills' fourth consecutive attempt at 
their first Super Bowl title as an exercise in futility are missing the point. 
"I see this more as an American epic," he said. "This game, for us, is about 
what it takes to endure. What it takes to come back, to keep fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith said that his separated shoulder was sore, but that it is sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "It held up for 26 carries on Sunday and I even sat down some of the fourth 
quarter, so I feel very good about my shoulder right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the reason he has downplayed the injury is because other players are 
playing with worse. "You think about my shoulder, then you should be thinking 
about Ken Norton's torn (biceps), and Kenny Gant's shoulder, which pops in and 
out of joint the whole game," he said. "Me, I'm just one of the guys." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps feeling it was too early in the week to start ripping the Bills, 
Cowboy defensive back Kevin Smith satisfied himself with a dig at former 
defensive coordinator Dave Wannstedt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were more aggressive this year," Smith said. "That was the biggest 
difference between Butch (Davis, current defensive coordinator) and Coach 
Wannstedt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A revealing moment in the relationship between Johnson and Cowboy owner Jerry 
Jones took place during Monday's press conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was preparing to take the podium as the first Cowboy to speak when 
Jones hopped up on the stage and spoke instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got upstaged," Johnson said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones spoke for a few minutes and then asked if there were any questions. He 
was met with silence. According to longtime observers, it was the first Super 
Bowl press conference where there were no questions. BILL PLASCHKE

<TEXT>
<P>
 June Jones was hired Monday to coach the Atlanta Falcons and Joe Bugel was 
fired as coach of the Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who succeeded Jerry Glanville, was the Falcons' assistant head coach 
for offense, and once spent four seasons as the club's backup quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Falcon President Taylor Smith said he'd known Jones, 40, a long time and "we 
felt June's the guy we'd like to run our football team." 
</P>
<P>
 The only other coach considered seriously was former Redskin coach Joe Gibbs. 
But, Smith said, the Redskins refused to allow the Falcons to talk to Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bugel, who received an ultimatum before the season to produce a winning team, 
was fired after a 7-9 finish. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the fourth NFL coach to be fired since the end of the regular season, 
joining Bruce Coslet (New York Jets), Richie Petitbon (Washington) and 
Glanville.

 Falcon quarterback Bobby Hebert will undergo surgery to repair a damaged 
tendon in his right arm. . . . Defensive line coach Mike DuBose, whose career 
includes moves from Alabama to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and back to the Crimson 
Tide, is headed to the NFL again for a second stint with the Buccaneers.

 Canyon High offensive lineman David Pratchard has made an oral commitment to 
attend USC. Pratchard, 6-foot-5, 263 pounds, had narrowed his choice to the 
Trojans and San Diego State. "I felt like USC had a lot more to offer," he 
said. "It has more of a tradition in the football area. I feel it can help me 
reach my goals in trying to get to the pro level and academically become 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Aubrey, a defensive back at St. Francis, has made an oral commitment to 
play at USC. Aubrey, 6-3, 210 pounds, said he was told he will play outside 
linebacker for the Trojans. He chose USC over Stanford and California.  
</P>
<P>
 "My parents went there," Aubrey said. "There was a lot of sentiment for me to 
go there. It's kind of been a boyhood dream of mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Tetzlaff of Westlake has orally committed to Arizona. A defensive 
end/linebacker, Tetzlaff (6-3, 220 pounds) was selected Ventura County 
defensive lineman of the year by county coaches. Arizona State and California 
also were among the teams that recruited Tetzlaff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arizona's defense is really tough and I want to be a part of that," Tetzlaff 
said. "Watching their defense gave me a rush. I can't wait." Figure Skating

 Tonya Harding basked in the applause of shoppers while skating at a mall in 
Portland, Ore., amid reports that authorities have enough evidence to arrest 
her in the attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities refused to comment on the Oregonian newspaper's report that 
investigators have enough evidence to charge Harding in the plot, but don't 
want to act until they feel more sure of getting a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 After skating, Harding drove to the cabin in the rural community of 
Beavercreek she once shared with ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and packed up her 
things with the help of a girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit Free Press reported that Harding and Gilloly are trying to 
implicate the other. "They're finger pointing at each other," said an unnamed 
investigator. "It's all finger pointing back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
 Another source said: "Gilloly has told investigators that he would serve her 
up on a silver platter." Baseball

 Chicago Cub outfielder Sammy Sosa received a nearly four-fold salary increase 
when he agreed to a $2.95-million, one-year contract.

contract, a cut of $50,000.

against Cal State Sacramento. The Matadors will play at Sacramento on Feb. 5 
and play host to the Hornets on Feb. 19.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: SEASON MIGHT BE OVER FOR VALLEY SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All athletic events in the Los Angeles Unified School District have been 
postponed for the second week in a row, and at least two schools have expressed 
interest in canceling their seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 As the nation's second largest district attempts to get back on track after 
last week's earthquake, the news has not been good for sports. A meeting has 
been scheduled for this afternoon at Grant High in Van Nuys to discuss options. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toy store of life has been put on hold," said Dick Browning, district 
senior high superintendent. "It's too difficult to focus on athletics right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Fiege, district athletic commissioner, said administrators from Van 
Nuys and San Fernando told her that their teams might not want to continue 
because of mounting problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the circumstances, we certainly cannot mandate that teams continue to 
play," said Fiege, who has been the commissioner since last October. "In many 
cases, gymnasiums have been condemned or are being used as shelters. Some 
athletes are homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said 23 of the district's 49 high schools have been affected by the 
quake. Gymnasiums at Granada Hills Kennedy, Sepulveda Monroe, Chatsworth, 
Verdugo Hills, Reseda and San Fernando are damaged and closed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools will resume classes today for the first time since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The winter season, which is half completed, includes boys' and girls' 
basketball, boys' and girls' soccer and wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many coaches want to continue the season, it might be difficult for 
the majority of schools in the heavily hit San Fernando Valley. Several 
gymnasiums that are not damaged are being used as shelters, leaving few 
facilities available for games or practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, playing games is nice, but not at the cost of making them into a 
negative situation," said Jeff Halpern, boys' basketball coach at Reseda. 
"Basketball is a good diversion, but will the kids have their hearts in it 
after all that has happened? I'm not sure it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Miller, boys' basketball coach at North Hollywood, said he favors trying 
to salvage the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people take the time and have flexibility, schools that want to play 
should be able to," he said. "Kids and coaches have invested a lot of time in 
the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said she will attempt to accommodate all schools that want to continue. 
She said schools with available gyms might have to share practice time with 
other teams. Games might even be played on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 All schools, whether back in session or not, may begin practicing today. 
Practice was not allowed while the district was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several Southern Section schools have also been affected by the quake. Mission 
Hills Alemany, a Catholic school with 1,600 students, has been condemned, with 
most buildings severely damaged. Classes will resume on double shifts Feb. 1 at 
the nearby Queen of Angels Junior Seminary. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's boys' and girls' basketball teams will continue with their 
seasons, however. The boys will practice at Woodbury University and the girls 
at Burbank Bell-Jeff High. Game sites are still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alemany girls have one of the top teams in the Southern Section with a 
16-0 record. Coach Melissa Hearlihy said she and her players are looking 
forward to resuming the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a very close-knit group and we all want to continue," said Hearlihy, 
whose Granada Hills apartment was demolished. "We're going to lose our 
home-court advantage, but at this point we're just happy to be playing. We're 
excited at seeing each other again." 
</P>
<P>
 Gymnasiums at L.A. Baptist in North Hills, Simi Valley, Crescenta Valley and 
Newhall Hart are also closed indefinitely and administrators were scrambling 
Monday to decide what to do. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 With one week remaining before the national football signing day, two of the 
Southland's top prospects have made unwritten commitments. Quarterback Keith 
Smith of Newbury Park said he will attend Arizona. Running back Rodney Sermons 
of La Puente Bishop Amat chose USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 5-10, 175, led Newbury Park to a 15-0 record and the Southern Section 
Division III title last season. He is the state's career passing leader with 
9,715 yards, including 3,988 yards and 38 touchdowns in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I got off the plane, I saw myself being there," Smith said of his 
trip to Tucson in mid-January. "I think there's a real great opportunity for me 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Sermons, 6-0, 185 pounds, was one of the area's most recruited running backs. 
In his two seasons as a starter, Bishop Amat had a 26-1 record, including the 
Southern Division I title in 1992. He finished with 2,844 rushing yards and 38 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 USC has also received a commitment from defensive back and kick returner Grant 
Pearsall of Villa Park. Prep Notes Paul Muff, athletic director and boys' 
basketball coach at Encino Crespi, died last Thursday of an infected leg. He 
was 46. Muff started at Crespi in 1976 and coached basketball for 14 seasons. 
He had a record of 204-124, including four Del Rey League championships. The 
Celts postponed all games last week. . . .The Irvine University wrestling team, 
one of the best in Orange County, forfeited 11 dual-match victories for using 
an ineligible athlete. The Trojans are 11-13-1. . . .Jaime Martinez, a standout 
cross-country runner from Orange, has made an unwritten commitment to Azusa 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Quinn, an assistant junior varsity boys' basketball coach at Mater Dei, 
was suspended for two games last week for his part in a fight during a game 
against Dana Hills at UC Irvine on Jan. 7. Quinn instigated a fight with 
assistant coach Dennis Dickens of Dana Hills and the two had to be separated by 
campus police. Dickens was not punished. . . . John Reardon, football coach at 
Oxnard Rio Mesa since 1967, has resigned. He had a record of 154-119-4 in 26 
seasons with the Spartans, including a Southern Section championship in 1971.

SIMI VALLEY'S BRADSHAW FACING SUSPENSION FOR UPCOMING GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Basketball coach Dean Bradshaw of Simi Valley High, who was involved in an 
on-court altercation with a player, will probably not be allowed to coach the 
Pioneers if the team plays its scheduled game Wednesday at Royal, Simi Valley 
Athletic Director George Ragsdale said Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 If Bradshaw is prohibited from leading the team, junior varsity coach Steve 
Johnson and sophomore coach Christian Aurand would share coaching duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Bradshaw) is suspended until we have an outcome, and I don't think we're 
going to get anything resolved by (Wednesday)," Ragsdale said. "I'm not sure if 
we'll have anything settled before the middle of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd hoped to bring this to a head in a timely fashion, but we haven't been 
able to get all the people together because of the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw pushed senior guard Sam Rodriguez, a reserve, in anger late in the 
fourth quarter of the Pioneers' 51-44 victory over Westlake during a Marmonte 
League game Jan. 14.

NEWBURY PARK'S SMITH SELECTS ARIZONA; FOOTBALL: RECORD-BREAKING QUARTERBACK, 
WHO ALSO WILL PLAY BASEBALL, LOOKS TO FLOURISH IN SPRINT-OUT OFFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 All-American Keith Smith of Newbury Park High -- the state's all-time leading 
passer -- has orally committed to Arizona, he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I got off the plane, I saw myself being there," said Smith, who 
visited the Tucson campus Jan. 14-16. "I think there's a real great opportunity 
for me there, and the academic facilities and support are great." 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers' record-setting quarterback also took recruiting trips to 
Colorado, San Diego State and UCLA. Smith -- Cal-Hi Sports player of the year 
-- made his decision Sunday evening after returning from Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that Smith was the only quarterback recruited by Arizona. Smith 
said the football staff has agreed to let him play for Arizona's baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who plans to major in communications, said the Wildcats' offensive 
style was paramount in his decision. Arizona quarterbacks are typically gifted 
athletes adept at throwing on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-feet, 180 pounds, Smith fits the mold perfectly. He has an exceptionally 
strong arm and covers 40 yards in 4.5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're going to use my ability real nice," Smith said. "They roll 
out a lot, which will let me get out into the open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to like that -- a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA also was initially high on Smith's list, but he was unsure he would play 
in the Bruins' system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't see myself there," Smith said. "All of their (quarterbacks) are 
like 6-3 or 6-4. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "And I don't know if they're willing to change their offense for one player." 
</P>
<P>
 Also ranked No. 2 nationally on the career list with 9,971 yards, Smith led 
Newbury Park to a 14-0 record and the Southern Section Division III title. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who has a 3.07 cumulative grade-point average, was selected both the 
Division III player of the year and The Times' Ventura County back of the year 
after completing 66% of his passes for a state-record 4,244 yards with 40 
touchdown passes and only 13 interceptions. He also rushed for a team-leading 
774 yards and 11 touchdowns in 104 carries (a 7.44-yard average). 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, Smith batted .347 and led the Panthers with nine doubles and 20 
stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is the third player from the region to commit to the Wildcats, joining 
L.A. Baptist receiver Jim Romero and Westlake defensive lineman Mike Tetzlaff.

CITY EVENTS POSTPONED FOR 2ND WEEK; REST OF SEASON COULD BE CANCELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff Writers

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All athletic events in the Los Angeles Unified School District have been 
postponed for the second consecutive week and City Section officials might be 
forced to cancel the rest of the winter sports season in the aftermath of the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, City Commissioner Barbara Fiege said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from schools affected by the earthquake will meet today at Grant 
High in Van Nuys to consider various options, including the holding of 
tournaments in place of the remainder of the regular season. Last week, all 
City Section athletic events were postponed because of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our options range from canceling the season to making all attempts to hold 
games," Fiege said. "This involves not only basketball, but soccer, wrestling 
and possible changes in the spring sports schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Practice for spring sports is scheduled to begin Feb. 15, but might be 
postponed, Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fiege, 24 of the City's 49 schools have been affected by the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Six San Fernando Valley schools -- Chatsworth, Kennedy, Monroe, Reseda, San 
Fernando and Verdugo Hills -- have basketball gymnasiums that suffered either 
structural or water damage and are unavailable indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, schools being used as shelters are Belmont, Birmingham, Canoga 
Park, Fairfax, Granada Hills, Hollywood, Manual Arts, North Hollywood, Sylmar 
and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando, which had been used as a shelter, was evacuated over the weekend 
when engineers discovered structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The gyms at Cleveland, El Camino Real and Hamilton suffered minor damage and 
had been unusable until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the options being considered to save the winter season would be to play 
double-, triple- and quadrupleheaders once the affected schools reopen. The 
City also is considering playing games on Saturdays, holding them at alternate 
sites or shortening the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The final option would call for single-elimination tournaments in boys' and 
girls' basketball and boys' and girls' soccer. Preliminaries and finals would 
be scheduled for wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing games is nice, but not at the cost of of making them into a negative 
situation," said Jeff Halpern, boys' basketball coach at Reseda. "Basketball is 
a good diversion, but will the kids have their hearts in it after all that has 
happened? I'm not sure it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Miller, boys' basketball coach at North Hollywood, said he favors trying 
to salvage the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people take the time and have flexibility, schools that want to play 
should be able to," he said. "Kids and coaches have invested a lot of time in 
the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Monroe's gym suffered substantial water damage and was deemed 
unusable for the rest of the season, Coach Paul Graber has no reservations 
about playing elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see the girls and boys double up at each of the sites," Graber 
said. "If you have a site to play at, you play there." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Coach Howie Levine concurred. "I want to see us get as many games in as 
possible."

 Inspectors on Monday closed the gym at Crescenta Valley of the Southern 
Section's Pacific League because of structural damage, according to basketball 
Coach John Goffredo, who said the gym will be unusable for at least a month.

<P>
 The Falcons will play the remainder of their home games at Glendale College. 
The game scheduled for Tuesday against Muir will be played Wednesday at 
Glendale College. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mission League, the eight athletic directors are scheduled to meet 
today at Notre Dame to discuss the rescheduling of games. Besides disruptions 
caused by the earthquake, Crespi postponed two games last week because of the 
death of Coach Paul Muff.

<P>
 In the Foothill League, Burbank will play its scheduled game at Burroughs 
tonight but the Hart-at-Canyon game has been postponed and the two sides appear 
to have different contingency plans. Canyon Coach Greg Hayes told his team it 
would play Hart either Wednesday or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a call from (Hart Principal Laurence Strauss) and that's not going to 
happen," said Hart assistant Gary Spindt. "But we're practicing and we'll play 
any time, any place." 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague action, tonight's game between Santa Paula and Oak Park (17-2) 
has tentatively been moved to Wednesday, but Oak Park Coach Rob Hall said the 
game might be canceled. Times' Top 20 Basketball Polls

PAC-10 WILL NOT PENALIZE LESLIE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pacific 10 Conference said Monday it would not penalize USC's Lisa Leslie 
for an altercation during a game at Oregon State on Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie struck Oregon State's Kristina Lelas with a backhand punch that Oregon 
State Coach Aki Hill said knocked out a tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill called for a two-week suspension of Leslie, but the conference said that 
no action would be taken.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious (Leslie) struck (Lelas) . . . but whether it was flagrant or 
deliberate . . . that can't be determined by what's on the tape," Pac-10 
spokesman Jim Muldoon said.  
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for taking no action, he said, was that game official Mary 
Whatford was in position directly in front of the incident and made no call. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape also shows Lelas holding Leslie's arm shortly before the punch.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; ANTEATERS MUST REMEMBER THEIR ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finals are over, but the men's basketball team is facing a very important 
chemistry test this week. The Anteaters are a team of role players, and knowing 
those roles and putting the team ahead of the individual is a key to their 
chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody on this team plays so hard, man," forward Jermaine Avie said. "We 
don't need nobody trying to do more than they can do. That's the kind of thing 
that causes friction. We don't need that attitude here, and we're not going to 
let it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Avie, a junior transfer from the College of Eastern Utah, is the Anteaters' 
top rebounder, with a 7.9 average and is fifth in scoring (9.5). He is the only 
Anteater to have started all 14 games and leads the team in minutes played 
(408). 
</P>
<P>
 When a team is losing, though, players on the end of the bench tend to start 
believing they deserve more playing time and an opportunity to see if they can 
help turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rod Baker continues to substitute freely -- 10 Anteaters are averaging 
at least 13 minutes -- but in three of the last four games, only eight have 
been in double figures in minutes played. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Zuri Williams and forwards LaDay Smith, Shaun Battle and Elzie Love are 
among those whose playing time has diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they feel bad about not playing as much," Baker said. "I certainly 
hope they do. But LaDay and Shaun are ones who will come back and compete, and 
that's what you want. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're losing, things tend to become fragmented and what we have to do 
now is get that back together. The question is who will step up and do 
something to change what's going on?" 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the season, the Anteaters' problems seemed to center on their 
inability to get the ball through the hoop. They were playing intense defense, 
rebounding pretty well and running their offense. They got good shots; they 
just didn't make them. 
</P>
<P>
 But in losses last week to Pacific and San Jose State, Irvine seemed 
emotionally flat for extended periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened," forward Mark Odsather said, "but it was like if 
there was a loose ball on the floor, I wasn't sure if we would be the first 
ones to dive for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, who was so unhappy with his team's play against San Jose Saturday that 
he held a 44-minute postgame team meeting, said he spent a good portion of 
Monday morning's practice on the same subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we addressed again," Baker said. "All of a sudden, we lost 
some of our focus and it's something we have to get back. A lot of the time 
this season, we have dictated the way the game was going. We did that only in 
spots against Pacific and at no time against San Jose State did we dictate the 
tempo." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Road warriors? The Anteaters came down out of the Wasatch Mountains last week 
feeling pretty good about themselves after a victory at Utah State. The season 
wasn't even half over and they were one game shy of equaling last season's 
victory total. 
</P>
<P>
 But after losses at home to Pacific and San Jose, Irvine is 5-9, 2-4 in the 
Big West, and Baker is talking about "going back to the drawing board." 
</P>
<P>
 Things don't figure to get better in a hurry, either. The Anteaters are facing 
four consecutive road games -- at Long Beach State, at UC Santa Barbara, at San 
Jose State and at Pacific -- and there's the distinct possibility that the lost 
weekend of Jan. 20-22 could be the beginning of another season of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody's celebrating: Forward Jinelle Williams, who had a season-high 18 
points and 12 rebounds during the women's team's 59-42 victory over Nevada 
Saturday night, walked past a group of reporters waiting for Baker to emerge 
from the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't you guys talk to us, we won," she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a junior forward from Brea-Olinda High, can be excused for taking 
the shot. The women's team, which has finished 2-24 the last two seasons, ended 
an 11-game losing streak and a 12-game Big West slide that was almost a year 
old. The Anteaters' hadn't won a conference game since Feb. 11, 1993, when they 
beat Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's defense held Nevada to 17 points and 24% field-goal shooting in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our press started to take its toll," Coach Colleen Matsuhara said. "That's 
the way it's supposed to work. Hopefully, we can build on this, but we have two 
tough games (Nevada Las Vegas and New Mexico State) coming up this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players seemed geared up and ready to let it loose before the (Nevada) 
game. We had a 12-point lead in the first half, but then we allowed them to get 
within three at halftime. But I would like to think our defense was the 
difference in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess all of our biorhythms were on the upswing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ouch patrol: Center DeForrest Boyer, who injured his right leg Jan. 8 against 
Cal State Fullerton, continues to play with a knee brace and enough tape to 
make his leg look like something out of a mummy movie. He also suffers from 
tendinitis in both knees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can play with the pain," he says, "but you know what hurts the worst? When 
they pull all that tape off after the game. I've shaved my whole leg and 
everything, but it doesn't seem to help. Man, that's pure torture." Anteater

AMERICAN EXPRESS TO SPIN OFF LEHMAN BROS.; FINANCE: THE INVESTMENT BANKING UNIT 
WILL BECOME AN INDEPENDENT COMPANY, LEAVING A CORE OF SERVICE BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stripping away the last of its ill-starred Wall Street acquisitions, American 
Express said Monday that it will spin off its Lehman Bros. investment banking 
unit into an independent company owned by American Express shareholders and 
Lehman employees. 
</P>
<P>
 What will remain is a core of service businesses -- the signature charge card, 
corporate services, travel and financial planning -- that can be marketed under 
the American Express brand name, said Chairman and Chief Executive Harvey 
Golub, who took over a year ago with a mandate to streamline and invigorate the 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the $1-billion sale last March of the Shearson retail brokerage 
business to what is now Travelers Corp., the long-predicted Lehman spinoff will 
complete the reversal of what had been the strategy of Golub's predecessor, 
James D. Robinson III. Robinson had acquired disparate financial services 
companies in what proved to be a vain hope that they would fit together. 
</P>
<P>
 American Express said it will inject $1.09 billion in capital into Lehman to 
make the newly independent company financially viable and assure it an "A" 
credit rating. In exchange, American Express will get a share of Lehman's 
potential future profits, as well as the share of Travelers profits Lehman 
receives as a result of the sale of Shearson. But the former parent will have 
no directors on Lehman's board. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman employees will pay $160 million for newly issued shares of Lehman 
stock, boosting the total capital infused into the new company to $1.25 billion 
-- the amount Golub said credit ratings agencies told him was needed to get the 
good rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong ratings are critical for securities firms, in part because they depend 
on short-term borrowing in their day-to-day business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will end up with two separate entities at the end of the day, both of 
which are prudently and adequately capitalized and both of which will end up 
with excellent ratings from the ratings agencies," Golub said. American Express 
said its shareholders will receive a dividend in the form of stock in the newly 
independent Lehman. 
</P>
<P>
 The spinoff will be completed in May or June, Golub said. 
</P>
<P>
 When American Express sold Shearson to Travelers, Travelers Chairman Sanford 
Weill did not want the Lehman segment of the business, which specializes in 
investment banking, trading and underwriting new issues of stocks and bonds. So 
American Express held on to the unit while taking steps to shore it up for an 
eventual sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The spinoff will give Lehman executives what they have dreamed of for years: 
freedom from American Express. 
</P>
<P>
 Long an independent pillar of Wall Street, the august Lehman Bros. was 
acquired by American Express in 1984 and merged with Shearson. But the Lehman 
culture never fit with Shearson or American Express, and the firms never 
developed the synergies that Robinson envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, during crisis periods for Shearson Lehman, American Express had to 
pay more than $2 billion in capital to the securities businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 American Express also announced its fourth-quarter and year-end earnings 
Monday. For the quarter, it reported income from continuing operations of $291 
million, or 57 cents per share, compared to $255 million, or 51 cents, for the 
same period in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 The spinoff was not announced until after the markets closed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 American Express stock closed up 62.5 cents at $31.50 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Back to Basics 
</P>
<P>
 The landscape of American Express Co. has changed dramatically over the past 
few decades as the company sought to diversify. Here is a brief chronology of 
events.

travel services become a wholly owned subsidiary, American Express Travel 
Related Services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1984: Purchases Investors Diversified Services, a financial planning 
company. Shearson acquires Lehman Bros. Kuhn Loeb, a brokerage firm, and

American Express' formal exit from the insurance business.

purchases over time. 
</P>
<P>

the biggest ever by a securities firm. 
</P>

Golub is named to replace him. 
</P>
<P>

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; SOME INSURANCE FIRMS STRADDLING FAULT LINE; 
LIABILITY: UNPRECEDENTED SERIES OF DISASTERS HAS LED SOME EXPERTS TO PREDICT 
THAT CERTAIN SMALL COMPANIES MAY FAIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some insurance experts think the Northridge earthquake could sink a few 
smaller insurance companies, especially ones heavily focused on commercial 
coverage in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has also revived questions about the industry's overall soundness, 
given the unprecedented string of catastrophes stretching back to the 1989 Loma 
Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 A.M. Best Co., one of the leading insurance rating firms, based in Oldwick, 
N.J., has begun an "informal review" of about 20 carriers whose business is 
concentrated in California, John H. Snyder, vice president for 
property-casualty insurance, said Monday. He declined to name the companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I expect 20 companies to become insolvent?" Snyder said. "No, but there 
might be a few, especially companies that are quite small and commercially 
oriented." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss Research, a consumer-oriented rating firm based in West Palm Beach, 
Fla., issued a dire report -- coincidentally released the day after the 
earthquake -- saying that "major property and casualty insurers may not have 
enough capital to pay the claims that could result from . . . an unexpectedly 
large natural disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss did not mean to imply that the Northridge quake was the sort of disaster 
that could precipitate that kind of an industry crisis, Weiss analyst Ted 
Brownstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance payouts from the Northridge quake are not expected to come close to 
the $18 billion in insured losses from Hurricane Andrew, because much of the 
damage was done to uninsured public property such as freeway overpasses and 
because earthquake policies carry high deductibles -- usually 10% of coverage 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade publication Business Insurance on Monday quoted catastrophe 
underwriters at Lloyd's of London as estimating the insured losses from the 
quake to be up to $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers have yet to estimate their individual dollar losses from the quake, 
saying it is too early to be accurate. State Farm, California's largest writer 
of homeowners and earthquake coverage, said it had received 50,000 loss reports 
as of Monday and expected the total to reach 115,000 claims. That compares with 
31,000 claims for State Farm in the Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Brownstein said Weiss' concerns stem from insurers' tendency to "fight the 
last war" -- acting as though the worst disaster losses in the past indicate 
likely losses in the future, and setting their reserves accordingly. But he 
says that disaster losses may be spiraling upward and that an $18-billion loss 
like that of Hurricane Andrew may be exceeded by another disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss gave weak safety ratings of "D+" to Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. and "D" 
to Reliance Insurance Co., large national carriers that write extensive 
earthquake insurance in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weiss firm tends to be conservative. Aetna's rating from A.M. Best is "A" 
(excellent). 
</P>
<P>
 Best's Snyder said he doubts that the Northridge earthquake will result in 
premium increases soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi has softened his stance against rate 
increases, however. On Jan. 12, he quietly approved a 6% increase in homeowners 
rates for Allstate Insurance Co., California's second-largest carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate hike, which will average $24 a year per policyholder, was approved 
without a hearing. It was the first hike in homeowners' rates for any large 
carrier since Garamendi took office in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 William Ahern, deputy commissioner, said one factor in granting the increase 
was that Allstate has paid rebates to policyholders under the Proposition 103 
insurance rollback initiative.

 Flagstar Cos., operator of the Denny's and El Pollo Loco chains, plans to sell 
or close as many as 180 of those restaurants -- including many California 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartanburg, S.C.-based company said Monday that it will close or sell up 
to 45 of the 212 El Pollo Locos. It would not specify the locations, but 137 of 
the 139 company-owned El Pollo Locos are in Southern California. The rest are 
owned by franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the company also plans to close or sell up to 135 of the 1,515 
Denny's. It will also shut down 90 of its 213 Quincy's Family Steakhouses, 
located in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar said the actions are in response to declining customer traffic, 
increased competition and adverse economic conditions. The company said it will 
take about $1.7 billion in charges to pay for the moves. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the targeted restaurants have had poor earnings. Outlets put on the 
sales block will be sold to franchisees, Flagstar said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually all the (targeted) Denny's tend to be in good business locations," 
said Coleman Sullivan, a spokesman for Flagstar. "For that reason, we expect to 
sell those stores or generate a sales turnaround at those locations." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the company is expected to have more difficulty selling its El Pollo 
Locos, which sell broiled chicken. Sales have been rising, but El Pollo Loco 
has been losing money because the unit has been forced to engage in heavy price 
cutting to compete with other restaurants.  
</P>
<P>
 "Restaurants face a lot of stress and competition because of the weak economic 
situation in Southern California," said Gerald Breitbart, a consultant for the 
California Restaurant Assn. "We're talking about discretionary spending, and 
restaurants in this area are struggling for that business." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, El Pollo Loco faces increased competition with other 
restaurants that offer chicken products. Carl Karcher Enterprises, operator of 
Carl's Jr. restaurants, recently announced plans to open as many as 300 Boston 
Chicken outlets in Southern California and Sacramento. Koo Koo Roo, another 
Southland-based broiled chicken chain, has been expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar has had to contend with controversy as well as more competitive 
markets. The company spent $4.2 million on advertising in 1993 to counter 
adverse publicity stemming from allegations of racial discrimination at some 
Denny's locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny's was founded in 1953 in Lakewood, and Flagstar acquired it in 1987 from 
a private company based in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1993, Flagstar reported a loss of $1.72 billion, or $40.93 a share, on 
revenue of $3.97 billion, compared to a loss $225 million, or $9.29 a share, on 
revenue of $3.72 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar shares fell 25 cents after the announcement Monday to close at $10.25 
on the Nasdaq market.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; POST-QUAKE REBUILDING FUELS 'BOOMLET' IN 
CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since 1990, Rito Alvarez has dangled from the tail end of Southern 
California's depressed economy. He is a man who, with his two sons, uses his 
hands to build things of cement, a skill in little demand when little is being 
built.  
</P>
<P>
 Now Alvarez finds himself on the leading edge of what will become an economic 
boomlet as the region rebuilds from last week's earthquake. Even as the ground 
continues to shift, people are clamoring for his services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the earthquake, we didn't have a single job," Alvarez said. "Then 
people I had done work for started to call. Now I have seven jobs already 
signed up and I have 15 estimates to give before the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a terrible thing that happened," he said. "But the situation has been 
so bad for the last four years, this is a blessing for us." 
</P>
<P>
 While economists argue whether the rebuilding will prove to be a net gain for 
the regional economy, it is elevating thousands of carpenters, drywallers, 
electricians, masons and other skilled workers to the first rank of commercial 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the jobs don't show up on the radar screens of employment statistics, 
so it's hard to know how many there are. But about 33,000 construction jobs, or 
one-fourth of the total, have vanished in Los Angeles County alone since 1990. 
At Laborers Local 300, three of five members are out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost apologetically, workers report that suddenly their phones are ringing 
off the hook, customers are approaching them on the street and they are 
scrambling for supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be very busy," carpet installation contractor Santiago Vanegas 
said last week as his two workers ripped water-drenched carpeting from a large 
apartment complex in the San Fernando Valley. "We want to do business, but 
that's not so important. We want to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Little actual rebuilding has begun. With continued aftershocks, the 
painstaking inspection process and insurance and government paperwork to be 
overcome, contractors said it will be a month before money begins to flow and 
large-scale work and significant hiring begin. For construction workers, the 
most prized jobs will be those rebuilding freeways, because of the pay and the 
long-term nature of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 But cleanup jobs and emergency repairs are making it a go-go time for big and 
small operators alike -- from construction firms and their subcontractors to 
specialized independent contractors with a couple of work crews to individuals 
(once called "handymen") with a contractor's license. 
</P>
<P>
 Masons such as Alvarez scramble to get from appointment to appointment. One 
job Alvarez obtained is for Fred Das, whose Sherman Oaks home lost 150 feet of 
concrete block wall in the earthquake. Das said he settled on Alvarez after two 
others wanted to do more work than was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 At Warner Center, a vast office park in Woodland Hills, Valley Construction 
Co. took on more than 15 subcontractors to quickly make the office space usable 
and shore up parking garages, hiring dozens of drywallers, concrete masons and 
ceiling crews. 
</P>
<P>
 With the construction slump, Valley's contracts at Warner Center and other 
commercial properties "kept us in business," owner John DeWeese said. "We've 
only got one new building under way. But since the earthquake, we are getting 
calls on new jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Big concerns such as Valley Construction sent out calls for about 300 
carpenters, millwrights, pile drivers and other members of the Carpenters Union 
and another 200 workers from Laborers Local 300, union officials said. But most 
such temporary work is non-union and therefore harder to measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor pool for rebuilding Los Angeles is vast. About 10,000 members of the 
Carpenters Union alone -- or more than 30% of its members in Southern 
California -- are out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 And many others who had found non-construction work are rejoining the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hale, a Santa Monica carpentry contractor, has been driving a taxi in lieu 
of construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the earthquake, he and his construction partner have begun preparing 
estimates for repair work in Santa Monica, Pacific Palisades and Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until the ground stops shaking, nobody's going to want to do anything," Hale 
said. "But it's inevitably going to help us out."

 CalFed Records Loss: As expected, California Federal Bank reported a 
$53.7-million fourth-quarter loss and a $145.5-million loss for all of 1993.The 
red ink was caused by continued write-downs of the value of CalFed's problems 
loans and foreclosures, owing to California's troubled real estate markets. The 
thrift set aside $60 million in loan loss provisions for the quarter and took 
nearly $250 million in charge-offs for the entire year. Bright spots were lower 
administrative costs in 1993 and a reduction in bad loans.

 Atlantic Richfield Co. Sees $330-Million Loss: The Los Angeles-based oil 
company posted the loss after setting aside $487 million in onetime 
extraordinary charges.Arco's fourth-quarter loss came to $2.06 per share on 
revenue of $4.76 billion. A year earlier, the company had a profit of $372 
million, or $2.30 per share, on revenue of $4.98 billion. The huge charge 
included $450 million to pay for the company's restructuring of its continental 
U.S. operations. The charge represents lower values for oil and gas holdings 
and money set aside for staff reductions. For the year, Arco had a profit of 
$269 million, or $1.66 per share, on revenue of $18.49 billion.

 Boeing's 4th-Quarter Earnings Down 15%: Due to fewer commercial airplane sales 
and costs of developing the new 777 twin jet, Seattle-based Boeing Co. reported 
earnings of $304 million, or 89 cents a share, in the final three months of 
1993, compared to $357 million, or $1.05 per share, a year earlier. Revenue for 
the quarter sank 24% to $5.7 billion, from $7.5 billion, for the comparable 
1992 period. Boeing said it expects total sales in the 
$20-billion-to-$21-billion range this year and plans to deliver 250 to 260 
commercial jetliners this year, compared to 330 in 1993 and 441 in 1992.

 Nynex Corp. Posts Big Loss, Plans Jobs Cuts: The New York-based phone company 
said it lost $1.24 billion in the fourth quarter after taking a $1.6-billion 
charge for a restructuring of its phone operations that will result in the 
elimination of 16,800 jobs by the end of 1996. The job cut is smaller than was 
suggested by news accounts in December that, citing a company memo, said up to 
one-third of the 66,000 jobs in Nynex's local phone operations could be 
eliminated.Between 11,000 and 12,000 of the cuts will be in New York, with the 
rest in New England. Nynex's fourth-quarter loss amounted to $3 per share. A 
year ago, the company earned $324.2 million, or 79 cents per share.

NEWS ANALYSIS; POLITICAL CONCERNS DRIVE TOKYO'S MARKET DOWN 954 POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japanese stock prices, which on Monday took their biggest plunge in more than 
two years, are expected to continue their volatility in the coming days as long 
as political turmoil threatens to delay economic stimulus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nikkei index fell 954 points, or 4.9%, to close at 18,353 Monday. This was 
the steepest fall since Aug. 19, 1991, when a 1,358-point drop was touched off 
by the attempted coup in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In morning trading today, prices rebounded modestly on the strength of foreign 
investors' and brokerage account dealers' purchases, and the index rose 99 
points to 18,452. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's selloff came in reaction to the parliamentary defeat Friday of a 
political reform package that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had made the 
centerpiece of his coalition government's legislative efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The setback not only guaranteed further delay of any economic stimulus 
program, it also threatened the unity of the seven-party ruling coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors betting on imminent passage of the political reform program, which 
would have cleared the way for Hosokawa to concentrate on the economy, bid up 
the market last week. Thus, to a large degree, Monday's plunge was a reaction 
to this disappointment, as investors liquidated those positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a natural rebound, since the fall yesterday was a little 
overdone," Daniel Marull, a trader at Bridge Trading Co., said during morning 
trading today. "But the political scene is still unclear and people are still 
worried." 
</P>
<P>
 New political factors, rather than economic fundamentals, are likely to drive 
the market until the future of the Hosokawa Cabinet and its policy options 
become more clear. There is still a small possibility, for example, that 
Hosokawa might reach a compromise with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
to achieve passage of a revised political reform package later this week. 
Investors would almost surely treat that as good news. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volatility is going to be extremely high, and the reason for that is the 
political situation is filled with opinions but is unpredictable," said Jesper 
Koll, an analyst with S.G. Warburg Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This week really could spike down to 17,500 (on the Nikkei) and could easily 
spike back up to 19,500," he said. "If politicians find the magic bullet . . . 
on political reform, that means a green light for economic stimulus, and that 
means the market is going to go through the roof." 
</P>
<P>
 Downward pressure on the market comes from fears that the political deadlock 
will become so severe that Hosokawa will call for elections. 
</P>
<P>
 That would not only bring uncertainties of an exceptionally fluid political 
situation, but could delay any serious economic program for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Monday that the government 
will try to work simultaneously on political reform and economic stimulus, tax 
reform and the fiscal 1994 budget, which takes effect April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "No firm schedule has been established," Takemura but the government still 
aims to reach decisions in all these areas before Hosokawa's Feb. 11 Washington 
summit with President Clinton, Takemura said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said Monday that Japan's economic 
conditions remain in the doldrums and that recovery is likely to take more 
time. Analysts at Salomon Bros. Asia Ltd. predicted that the Bank of Japan may 
respond to the political disarray, and the resulting delay in implementation of 
an overall economic stimulus package, by cutting interest rates more quickly 
and deeply than has been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The key question for the market now is whether the ruling coalition can muddle 
through, survive in office and enact a stimulus program, or whether Hosokawa 
will give up on that approach and call elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is no election . . . the market will be stabilized, and even from 
now I think there would be some recovery," said UBS Securities analyst Shigeru 
Akiba, "but if there is an election in the next few weeks, the market will go 
down more."

NEW FARE WAR SPURRED BY NORTHWEST PRICE CUTS; AIRLINES: SIX MAJOR CARRIERS SAY 
THEY'LL MATCH THE 30% CUTS ON TRAVEL TO AFRICA, INDIA, MIDDLE EAST AND EUROPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's top airlines joined in the latest air fare war Monday, matching 
30% price cuts on overseas travel set by Northwest Airlines over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines, American Airlines, Trans World Airlines, Delta Air Lines, 
Continental and USAir said they will match the cuts initiated by Northwest and 
partner KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest on Sunday unveiled the fares on tickets to 80 destinations in 
Africa, India, the Middle East and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 For African and Asian destinations, tickets must be purchased by Feb. 11, and 
for Europe by Feb. 28., for travel between April 1 and Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 As with most recent sales, passengers who book tickets early get the biggest 
discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first coordinated action on fares by the two airlines, which are 
operating in a business alliance. Northwest Airlines Corp. is a subsidiary of 
NWA Inc. KLM owns 49% of Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Paul, Minn.-based air carrier has often been a pacesetter in air fare 
price cuts, and most other carriers are typically forced to follow its lead in 
order to be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northwest flights will connect with KLM Royal Dutch flights out of 
Amsterdam. Northwest said a ticket between Detroit and Paris would cost $638; 
San Francisco and Amsterdam, $758; New York and Bombay, $1,258, and Boston and 
Tel Aviv, $898. 
</P>
<P>
 The discounts took some industry experts by surprise because they occurred 
unexpectedly early and covered an unusually long period. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have preferred to have waited to see if we needed to stimulate the 
market," said Bill Berry, a spokesman for Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 Weak overseas traffic plagued U.S. carriers in 1993, especially in Europe, 
where the sluggish economy has cut into leisure travel. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northwest and United, the one exception has been the Far East.

 Pacific Telesis, Hewlett-Packard in Pact: The two firms said they have agreed 
to develop technology that will let California customers call up movies and 
other programs "on demand" by late this year or early next.Computer maker 
Hewlett-Packard will supply large "video servers," powerful computers that will 
distribute digital video to consumers' homes. Pacific Bell will provide the 
dial tone network over which the service will be offered. If the FCC approves, 
the service will be available initially in San Diego, Orange County, Los 
Angeles and Silicon Valley.

 AT&T Seeks to Raise Business Rates: The company said it has proposed increases 
averaging 4% on its business long-distance service and 800 lines. It also 
suggested a restructuring of rates for small businesses under which they could 
receive volume discounts on domestic and basic international long-distance 
services. With FCC approval, the higher rates will be effective Friday and the 
new rate structure will begin March 1.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: WINTER OLYMPICS ADVERTISERS IN A SPIN OVER MIRACLE 
ON ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a few months ago, the Winter Olympics seemed about as thrilling to 
marketers as watching a Norwegian iceberg melt. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many Americans who cannot identify a luge -- even if one were to ram 
them from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 With viewership of the Winter Olympics far less than the Summer Olympics, 
skeptics have said that sponsors who invest big bucks in Winter Games are 
tossing their money into the snow. But when Coca-Cola, Visa and six others 
agreed to pay a fee of $40 million each to globally link their products to 
Atlanta's 1996 Summer Olympics, the rights to the Winter Olympics were thrown 
in for free. And for the 1994 Winter Olympics, that could prove to be as good 
as gold. 
</P>
<P>
 As Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding bone up for their own World Heavyskate 
Championship next month in Lillehammer, Norway, the industry buzz is that the 
Olympic sponsors may have stumbled upon the sports marketing gig of the year -- 
if not the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are compiling evidence to determine whether Harding helped plan an 
attack earlier this month by a man who tried to disable Kerrigan at a Detroit 
skating rink. While it remains unclear whether Harding will be permitted to 
compete in the Games, marketers say that even without her presence, Kerrigan 
will attract a huge viewing audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a Winter Games countdown each evening on the nightly news," said 
Brian Murphy, publisher of Sports Marketing Letter. "It will be a ratings 
titan." 
</P>
<P>
 The Winter Games have always been the "weak sister" of the Olympics, said Lesa 
Ukman, publisher of IEG Sponsorship Report, a Chicago newsletter. But the 
publicity the attack on Kerrigan has generated, she said, "is the best thing 
that has ever happened to the Winter Games." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, CBS has only "a few" available spots left for its entire 120 hours of 
Olympics broadcast, from Feb. 12 to 26, said George Schweitzer, senior vice 
president of the network. It expects to be sold out of commercial time by the 
end of this week, he said. In 1992, the network was still selling air time on 
the day the Winter Olympics began. 
</P>
<P>
 Since most Winter Olympics viewers will probably focus on the women's skating 
finals, CBS is expected to tease curious viewers with an avalanche of updates 
on everything from Harding's latest pool hall exploits to the color of 
Kerrigan's tutu. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will raise the ratings through the roof," said Don Franken, president of 
the Los Angeles sports marketing firm World Class Sports. "The trick now is for 
sponsors to heavily market their sponsorships." Sponsors who do it right, he 
said, could see sales increase. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not be that easy to figure out who is a real Olympic sponsor and who 
is simply running ads that seem to tie the advertiser to the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Good ol' Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's hamburger chain, will appear in TV 
spots in which he dreams of "winning gold" in everything from ski jumping to 
bobsledding. In one ad, he even asks 1992 Olympic gold medalist Kristi 
Yamaguchi to skate with him in competition.  
</P>
<P>
 But Wendy's is not a so-called global sponsor. Those companies have paid $40 
million each just for the rights to say they are "official" worldwide sponsors. 
Some of them will spend up to $40 million more for the production of ads and 
for air time. Other sponsorships are far less costly. Since Wendy's has 
purchased air time during the CBS telecast -- and paid the network a stipend -- 
it can refer to itself as a "sponsor of the CBS telecast" of the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Won't some viewers be confused? "It's possible, but that's not our intention," 
Wendy's spokesman Mike Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the largest global sponsors is Coca-Cola, which will air 165 TV spots 
during the Winter Olympics. "In terms of enhancing our global leadership 
position, the Olympics make perfect sense," Coke spokesman Bob Bertini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Xerox is putting an Olympic spin on almost every marketing or promotional 
campaign it has going. "The ice skating incident has put the Winter Games smack 
in front of everyone's eyeballs," said Terry Dillman, Los Angeles-based manager 
of Olympic marketing for Xerox. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to 'Olympicize' every program we have," Dillman said. At trade 
shows, Xerox brings along banners, T-shirts and pins that have the Olympic 
insignias. And its ads include the familiar Olympic rings. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, every package of Kodak film sold has also featured the 
rings. "We're leveraging our association with one of the world's most 
recognized symbols," explained Gregory Walker, marketing manager at Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most recognized symbol of the 1994 Winter Olympics might be Kerrigan. 
And two sponsors that have link-ups with her are taking full advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Reebok was in Los Angeles last weekend filming a new Kerrigan TV spot to be 
aired during the Games. In the ad, which shows Kerrigan in training, she talks 
about all the obstacles she had to overcome to make it to the Olympics. But 
Kerrigan will make no mention of the incident in Detroit in the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may see the ad and think it was created in response to the events in 
Detroit," Reebok spokesman Dave Fogelson said. "But it was planned months ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Soup, meanwhile, has been airing a spot that shows Kerrigan -- in 
full hockey uniform -- knocking a hockey player to the ice. The idea for the 
spot was concocted 18 months ago when Kerrigan told executives at Campbell's ad 
agency that -- when she was very young -- she preferred playing hockey with the 
boys to figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Detroit nightmare, Campbell asked Kerrigan if she wanted them to 
stop running the ad. She said no. In the meantime, grocers are having a tough 
time holding on to 15,000 life-size cardboard cut-outs of Kerrigan that 
Campbell distributed to them this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're disappearing," said Kevin Lowery, a Campbell spokesman. "And we don't 
know where." Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>

 Eight major marketers have signed on as "global sponsors" of the 1994 Winter 
Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, and the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Each 
sponsor must pay at least $40 million in cash and services to be linked to the 
Olympics. (A number of other companies have signed on for limited sponsorships 
that are not global.) Here are the global sponsors and their marketing plans 
for the winter Games.

its ties to the Games.

sweepstakes.

'SANKOFA' TAKES A DIFFERENT ROUTE TO THEATERS; MOVIES: INDEPENDENT CO-PRODUCERS 
BECAME ENTREPRENEURS TO HELP GET 'SANKOFA,' THEIR CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED BUT 
STUDIO-IGNORED FILM, DISTRIBUTED.

<P>
 To complete their feature film on slavery, independent producers Haile Gerima 
and Shirikiana Aina pleaded for foundation grants, bartered for plane tickets 
and lodging and charged supplies on their credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 They finished the film near the end of last year for less than $1 million. But 
making "Sankofa" was the easy part. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the rounds of film festivals around the world, director Gerima and 
co-producer Aina reaped critical praise and a few prizes for the film, which 
examines slavery through the eyes of a young African American woman. But from 
the hundreds of distributors who saw the film, they got nary a nibble. "We did 
not get a peep," Aina said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, that speaks of the unreadiness of the industry in certain issues," 
Gerima said. "I think it has to do with the racism within Hollywood that 
pretends to parade as liberal." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, the lack of interest is no surprise to industry 
observers. What's unusual is the back door that Aina and Gerima -- husband and 
wife who are also professors at the communications school at Howard University 
in Washington -- used to get the film into a few theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a not an interest in Hollywood to make African American-targeted 
films unless they can make money," said Byron Lewis, chairman of New York's 
Uniworld Group, an advertising firm that specializes in marketing to 
minorities. The screenplays that demonstrate moneymaking ability have been "the 
urban psychodramas, the films that talk about young people, gangs (and) 
violence," said Lewis, whose firm has aided major studios in marketing movies 
to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sankofa" had another built-in risk for a distributor looking for a return on 
investment in promotion and distribution costs: No big stars. The lead roles 
are played by Ghanaian actress Alexandra Duah and Washington actress Oyafunmike 
Ogunlano, both virtually unknown. Studios spend an average of $11.9 million 
marketing a film. And they don't want to risk losing money by experimenting 
with anything outside the tried-and-true format, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced there was an audience for their film, Gerima and Aina turned to 
friends in their hometown of Washington for help. They formed a committee of 
local supporters who helped throw a fund-raising premiere that pulled in more 
than $20,000. With that they rented a Washington movie theater in October, and 
the film played there for 11 weeks, outlasting many other discount-priced films 
at the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sankofa," Gerima's seventh film, has become something of a phenomenon in 
Washington, drawing a steady stream of moviegoers largely through word of 
mouth. Its advertising campaign includes a simple black-and-white poster, 
leaflets and local radio and TV appearances by the filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerima and Aina made enough of a profit (which they split with the theater 
owners) to make copies of the film and release it in a second city. On Jan. 21, 
it premiered at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and on Friday, it will open 
at a Boston movie theater for an indefinite run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be interesting in Boston. They had to turn away over 
500 people the first night it premiered," Gerima said, adding that the interest 
in Boston stemmed from the film's success in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is scheduled to be shown in a Baltimore shopping mall in February and 
later in New York. Gerima also expects to show the film in Los Angeles, 
Chicago, Detroit and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The studios' decision to overlook films such as "Sankofa" can be a big 
mistake, warned Ken Smikle, publisher of Target Market News, a Chicago-based 
newsletter that tracks developments in marketing to black consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This lack of risk taking is going to come back to haunt distributors," 
because blacks are a fast-growing segment of the nation's movie audience, he 
said. "The future really belongs to those who know how to serve those markets." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Gerima's and Aina's grass-roots distribution may be the only option 
for black independent filmmakers, said Mary Schmidt Campbell, dean of Tisch 
School of the Arts at New York University. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent "filmmakers have to be extraordinarily resourceful in finding a 
venue where they can begin to build a public. Spike Lee (a graduate of NYU's 
film program) tells students when he comes to talk to them not to wait to be 
discovered, but to make it happen on your own," she said. "That's the 
entrepreneurial approach we try to convey."

BACKUP NEEDED FOR SOME CD VERSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I enjoyed reading Jennifer Pendleton's article (Dec. 28) on Digital Theater 
Systems. However, I'd like to point out that a claim made in the article is 
somewhat misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 The article states that with the DTS system, studios will save money by only 
having to send a foreign language version CD for overseas markets. This is not 
entirely correct. Since the backup track for the DTS film is the traditional 
soundtrack printed on the film, if the foreign language CD should fail, the 
international audience would then hear the backup track, presumably in English. 
Obviously, this wouldn't be an acceptable presentation. Therefore, studios will 
still be required to provide foreign-language-dubbed prints to ensure 
trouble-free presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 While this is a small point in comparison to the large achievement of DTS, I 
thought you might appreciate the added information.

EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE MAY SLOW SLUGGISH SOUTHLAND RECOVERY; ECONOMY: LESS O.C. JOB 
GROWTH IS FORECAST, BUT COST OF REPAIRS IS NOT LIKELY TO PLUNGE THE REGION BACK 
INTO RECESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Southern California's sluggish economic recovery will be even slower this year 
as earthquake recovery takes precedence. 
</P>
<P>
 But as steep is it may be, the cost of recuperating from the Jan. 17 
Northridge quake is not likely to drive Southern California back into a 
recession, according to area economists. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said employment growth that had been predicted in Orange County 
this year is likely to flatten out a bit -- perhaps a net gain of only 1,500 
jobs instead of the 2,200 previously forecast by economists at Chapman 
University in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sustained most of the quake damage and that has resulted in 
predictions of big increases in construction spending and employment. But Los 
Angeles, which was faring worse than Orange County even before the earth moved, 
should still lose about 30,000 jobs this year. The post-quake difference, 
economists said, is that there will be less trauma in the construction industry 
and more in retailing, services and manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake -- and the flood of speculation about how soon it will be until 
the long-awaited "Big One" hits -- also is likely to speed up the manufacturing 
industry's exodus from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But even that should not be enough to knock the region back into a full 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week I would have been much more inclined to say we were looking at a 
significant economic setback," said Bruce DeVine, chief economist for the 
Southern California Assn. of Governments. "But the key is the transportation 
system, and it is starting to look like they'll have much of it operating in a 
week or two." 
</P>
<P>
 The region will suffer from "the very expensive replacement of fixed assets, a 
lot of which won't be covered by insurance or government, but at least there 
won't be an ongoing, daily shock to the economy because people simply can't get 
to places they need to go," he said. "If there was a recovery coming, this 
probably won't slow it down too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Esmael Adibi, director of Chapman University's Center for Economic Research, 
estimated quake-related damage to structures and building contents at $7.8 
billion but said insurance and government programs should pay for about half of 
that. In addition, Chapman economists last week estimated that the earthquake 
will throw a chill on Southland tourism for the rest of the year -- resulting 
in a loss of as much as $4.6 billion from reduced spending. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles County alone has an annual economy of $300 billion or more, 
and Orange County's annual economic output is about $70 billion. The $8 billion 
or so in uncovered losses, Adibi said, amounts to just 2.7% of the total 
regional economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs of digging out and rebuilding "will have a major impact," said Anil 
Puri, dean of the economics department at Cal State Fullerton. "We had seen 
some good signs of real growth in Southern California, and signs that 
business's attitude was becoming more optimistic, and this will hurt . . . but 
not enough to keep us in recession." 
</P>
<P>
 For Puri and other economists, the long-term question is what impact the quake 
will have on business decisions to move out of the area -- or to stay out if 
they were considering relocating to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts, however, subscribe to the theory that business relocation 
decisions are made for other, more tangible reasons. "They look for market, 
transportation, the availability of trained employees, tax benefits and things 
like that," said Adibi. 
</P>
<P>
 If companies evacuated a place every time there was a natural disaster, the 
economists say, then Florida and much of the Midwest would be vacant. 
Hurricanes, tornadoes, sub-zero winters and massive flooding don't permanently 
damage those regions' economies, and the Northridge quake isn't likely to spawn 
a major exodus from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Renzas, executive vice president of Paragon Decision Resources Inc., an 
Irvine-based business relocation consulting company, said that there was a 
short-term movement out of the San Francisco area immediately after the Loma 
Prieta earthquake in 1989. "But there has been absolutely no major change in 
the business base there." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies most likely to move are companies already considering it -- heavy 
industry and other businesses with large, relatively low-paid labor forces that 
are having problems remaining competitive in California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1990, a year after Loma Prieta, there was a significant blip in San 
Francisco companies opening branches or, in some cases, relocating entirely, to 
Sacramento and Reno," Renzas said. "And I'd expect next year to see a blip of 
Southern California companies relocating to Phoenix and Las Vegas and probably 
some California areas outside the greater L.A. basin." 
</P>
<P>
 But tracking those movements back to the earthquake is impossible, he said, 
"because nobody, but nobody would ever admit that's why they moved. It doesn't 
play well from a publicity standpoint, so there always will be some other 
reason (given for why) they moved." 
</P>
<P>
 Renzas said he would not be doing his job if he didn't caution clients about 
the threat of a bigger earthquake hitting Southern California sometime in the 
next 30 to 40 years, but he still remains bullish on the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smaller, younger, 'knowledge' industries in technology, software and 
biotech are what carry the economy and they are very unlikely to relocate," 
Renzas said. "They need to be where the employment and knowledge base is at, 
and that's here."

POST-QUAKE REBUILDING FUELS 'BOOMLET' IN CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since 1990, Rito Alvarez has dangled from the tail end of Southern 
California's depressed economy. He is a man who, with his two sons, uses his 
hands to build things of cement, a skill in little demand when little is being 
built.  
</P>
<P>
 Now Alvarez finds himself on the leading edge of what will become an economic 
boomlet as the region rebuilds from last week's earthquake. Even as the ground 
continues to shift, people are clamoring for his services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the earthquake, we didn't have a single job," Alvarez said. "Then 
people I had done work for started to call. Now I have seven jobs already 
signed up and I have 15 estimates to give before the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a terrible thing that happened," he said. "But the situation has been 
so bad for the last four years, this is a blessing for us." 
</P>
<P>
 While economists argue whether the rebuilding will prove to be a net gain for 
the regional economy, it is elevating thousands of carpenters, drywallers, 
electricians, masons and other skilled workers to the first rank of commercial 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 The kinds of little jobs -- such as redoing a cracked interior wall -- that 
small contractors do are usually handed out to local businesses. So the 
Northridge quake won't provide much work for the small operators in Orange 
County, according to contractors here. Says Mario Valadez, a drywall contractor 
from Fullerton: "I went up there a few days after the quake, and there's quite 
a bit of drywalling going on. But it seemed to be all local guys doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the jobs don't show up on the radar screens of employment statistics, 
so it's hard to know how many there are. But about 33,000 construction jobs, or 
one-fourth of the total, have vanished in Los Angeles County alone since 1990. 
At Laborers Local 300, three of five members are out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost apologetically, workers report that their phones are ringing, customers 
are approaching them on the street and they are scrambling for supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be very busy," carpet installation contractor Santiago Vanegas 
said last week as his two workers ripped water-drenched carpeting from a large 
apartment complex in the San Fernando Valley. "We want to do business, but 
that's not so important. We want to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Little actual rebuilding has begun. With continued aftershocks, the 
painstaking inspection process and insurance and government paperwork to be 
overcome, contractors said it will be a month before money begins to flow and 
large-scale work and significant hiring begin. For construction workers, the 
most prized jobs will be those rebuilding freeways, because of the pay and the 
long-term nature of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 But cleanup jobs and emergency repairs are making it a go-go time for big and 
small operators alike -- from construction firms and their subcontractors to 
specialized independent contractors with a couple of work crews to individuals 
(once called "handymen") with a contractor's license. 
</P>
<P>
 Masons such as Alvarez scramble to get from appointment to appointment. One 
job Alvarez obtained is for Fred Das, whose Sherman Oaks home lost 150 feet of 
concrete block wall in the earthquake. Das said he settled on Alvarez after two 
others wanted to do more work than was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the rodents come out of the woodwork in situations like this," warned San 
Fernando Valley carpentry contractor Craig Stevens.

 At Warner Center, a vast office park in Woodland Hills, Valley Construction 
Co. took on more than 15 subcontractors to quickly make the office space usable 
and shore up parking garages, hiring dozens of drywallers, concrete masons and 
ceiling crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Big concerns such as Valley Construction sent out calls for about 300 
carpenters, millwrights, pile drivers and other members of the Carpenters Union 
and another 200 workers from Laborers Local 300, union officials said.

 Bob Hale, a Santa Monica carpentry contractor, has been driving a taxi in lieu 
of construction projects. But since the earthquake, he and his construction 
partner have begun preparing estimates for repair work in Santa Monica, Pacific 
Palisades and Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until the ground stops shaking, nobody's going to want to do anything," Hale 
said. "But it's inevitably going to help us out."

ACOUSTICAL SURGE; UNPLUGGED IS IN, ELECTRIC IS OUT: UNAMPLIFIED GUITARS BACK ON 
TOP 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 People aren't buying as many new pianos these days. Clarinets and trumpets 
aren't doing so well either, what with all those school-band budgets running in 
the red. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the guys with the big hair and the leather trousers running around 
on MTV, even electric guitars are down. 
</P>
<P>
 What is selling are unamplified, acoustic guitars: Old-fashioned, 
folk-singer-guy-with-a-crew-cut, let's-have-a-hootenanny-type guitars. 
</P>
<P>
 Just five years ago, all the world's guitar makers shipped only 250,000 
acoustics to U.S. stores. Now it's 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, for the first time ever, acoustic guitars were outsold by 
the more modern electric ones -- many of them rakish heavy-metal shark fins in 
exotic colors that exist nowhere in nature. Now the acoustics are back on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Kent Everett, a small guitar-maker from Atlanta. Everett manned a 
tiny booth at the National Assn. of Music Merchants trade show at the Anaheim 
Convention Center over the weekend and complained about how he had to switch to 
electric guitars in the 1980s because his acoustics didn't sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he sells every one of the 60 acoustic guitars he makes by hand each year. 
And at an average $1,800 a pop, they're not cheap. Among his customers are one 
of the folk-singing duo Indigo Girls and the guitarist for the rock band 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not getting rich," says Everett, 37, who has the credentials for a hip 
business like guitar manufacturing -- including dropping out of college and 
motorcycling cross-country in his youth. "But I'm making a comfortable living, 
even with spending $10,000 a year for advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm a much happier guy making acoustics."  
</P>
<P>
 Or consider the venerable Martin Guitar Co. of Nazareth, Pa., across an acre 
or so of guitars and upstairs from Everett at the trade show, which ended 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin has made guitars since 1833 for everyone from folk singer Don McLean to 
the bluesy Bonnie Raitt to Gene Autry. Martin -- whose most expensive 
production-line guitar retails for a scary $7,000 -- is to acoustic guitars 
what Roll-Royce is to cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Martin, though, ran into serious trouble in the early 1980s as electric 
guitars overwhelmed the quieter, more sedate acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
 By last year, though, Martin says it was having its best year ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the guitar business is relatively small -- $400 million worth of 
sales, or less than a fifth the $2.2-billion cost of a single Stealth bomber -- 
hardly anybody outside the business notices whether it's doing well or not. In 
fact, hardly anybody noticed the passing of this uniquely American industry 
when -- in the 1970s -- most guitars started being made in the Far East. Today, 
only a fraction of all the world's guitars are made in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been around over a hundred years, and we just made our 500,000th 
guitar," says Richard DeWalt, Martin's national sales manager. "The Koreans 
probably make that many in a year or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if the 900 or so exhibitors at this trade show hadn't been so busy 
selling, they would probably have agreed that a big theme this year is the 
contrast between instruments so high tech they'd look at home in "Star Wars" 
and stuff so retro it could be in an Elvis movie. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Roland Corp.'s exhibit, for instance, you can plug an electric guitar 
into a book-sized purple box and -- presto! -- out comes the keening, synthetic 
wail of a synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Over here is something even snazzier called the Intelligent Synthesizer, a 
keyboard that can produce the sound of any instrument, including eight kinds of 
drums. Press another button and the machine will even harmonize with what 
you're playing. There are as many computer terminals in this room as there are 
keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, even IBM had a booth at the show, where IBMers in black T-shirts and 
jeans grooved to the fab sounds being pumped out via CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, when they get the information superhighway up and running, it will 
have a soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are outfits like Tube Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitar amplifiers, like radios, once used vacuum tubes to control the flow of 
electricity. In the 1960s and 1970s, manufacturers began using less expensive, 
solid-state transistors. 
</P>
<P>
 Transistors made amps cheaper and more convenient -- the glass vacuum tubes, 
after all, broke or burned out. But aficionados declared the new amps to have a 
colder, thinner, less luscious sound than the old tube amps. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, a guy named B. K. Butler began making a little foot pedal 
with a tube in it that a guitarist could hitch up to his transistor amp to get 
a tube-type sound. (In fact, you can still buy one for $165.) But six years 
ago, Butler's Tube Works in Denver went the distance and began making tube 
amplifiers again. Some of them even look like old amps that might have been 
used by the Ventures or surf guitarist Dick Dale. 
</P>
<P>
 The amps, though more expensive and decidedly retro, are even popular with 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids know all about tubes these days," says Brad Lillard, a salesman for Tube 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us back to the acoustic guitar, the most retro item of them all. 
Why is it so popular again? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a folkie-coffeehouse-hippie thing," says Doc Pittillo of Costa Mesa, a 
craftsman who makes a handful of first-rate, fairly expensive electric guitars 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought all that stuff would happen again, but by God it has." 
</P>
<P>
 John Hall is owner of Rickenbacker guitars, the quintessentially '60s electric 
guitars once played by the Beatles and the Byrds. He says: "It's the popularity 
of country music. It's 'MTV Unplugged.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see (rock guitarist Eric) Clapton playing an acoustic, you can be 
sure it's cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Rickenbacker is famous for making electric guitars. With acoustic guitars all 
the rage, though, the Santa Ana company is now making them, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Even ultra-classy acoustic guitar-maker Martin has had to change with the 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, its expensive guitars are selling pretty well; a good many customers, 
for instance, are thought to be middle-aged yuppies indulging themselves in a 
luxury they couldn't afford in their youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, to make ends meet, Martin has had to peddle a second line of less 
expensive guitars, instruments with a good deal less cachet. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because they're made in Indonesia, Taiwan and Korea -- just about as 
far from Pennsylvania as you can get.

INDEPENDENT O.C. BANKS REPORT LOSSES TOTALING $28.9 MILLION; RECESSION: THE 
FIGURES, FOR FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 1993, REFLECT RESULTS OF THE LONG-RUNNING 
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's community banks, reflecting the long-running recession, 
recorded a combined loss of $28.9 million through the first nine months of 1993 
and will probably report a significant loss for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 10 of the 27 independent banks based in the county posted profits for the 
period, and losses cut into capital -- the final cushion against losses -- at a 
number of institutions, according to federal statistics compiled by Sheshunoff 
Information Services Inc. in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of it is economy-related," said Robert P. Zingg, president of Colonial 
Bank in Santa Ana. Foreclosures in the county, for instance, rose to a record 
level last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the problems at the banks stem from the erosion of real estate values, 
said Edward J. Carpenter, an Irvine banking consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate typically is used as collateral for loans, he said, and the long 
decline in property values has undermined the safety of numerous loans, forcing 
banks to stash huge chunks of money in reserve for possible losses. Those 
reserves typically come from would-be profits and capital, Carpenter said, and 
banks should have enough in reserve now to cover problem loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Zingg noted that the recession has crippled banks' commercial customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had companies today that have been hanging on by their teeth for two 
years," he said. "Now, as the economy is starting to turn, they don't have the 
staying power. When a commercial client goes out of business, it hurts the 
lender." 
</P>
<P>
 Colonial, which is liquidating itself and turning in its charter soon, was the 
biggest moneymaker for the nine-month period, with $1.1 million in earnings. 
Landmark Bank in La Habra, which shook off the shackles of restrictive 
regulatory orders last fall, earned $1 million. None of the other profitable 
banks came close to those amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Colonial has set Feb. 28 as its target for turning in its charter. The 
6-year-old bank has found that increasing regulations and paperwork have become 
too burdensome for smaller community banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Zingg said, the operators have been mortgage bankers, which has been 
a profitable area for the institution, and will continue those operations as a 
private mortgage company unfettered by banking regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Money-losers were led by one-time model institution CommerceBank in Newport 
Beach, which lost $9.4 million. Following it were Sunwest Bank in Tustin, 
Commercial Center Bank in Santa Ana and Pioneer Bank in Fullerton, which had 
losses of $7.2 million, $4.23 million and $4.18 million, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 CommerceBank's basic capital fell to 3.18% of its assets, and Sunwest's 
dropped to 4.12%. Regulators require a 3% minimum, but bankers say they need 5% 
to carry on normal banking functions without restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 CommerceBank and Pioneer are awaiting federal approval for public stock 
offerings to existing shareholders and the public. The money will be used to 
shore up sagging capital levels.  
</P>
<P>
 The local banking industry hasn't had a money-losing year since 1986, then the 
last of four consecutive years of red ink as banks struggled out of the 1982-83 
recession.

 Though it has yet to sell any drugs on the market, Oncotech Inc. is 
nonetheless expanding its product line. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-year-old, privately held biotechnology firm in Irvine just signed a deal 
with UC Irvine and its Orange-based medical center to develop a vaccine for 
deadly ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which earns income by providing lab work on biopsies for local 
cancer centers, is working to develop two cancer-fighting drugs -- one with 
Cornell University, Chief Executive Frank Kiesner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiesner said that the newest development deal is based on research by Morrie 
Granger, professor of molecular biology and biochemistry at UCI. The company 
will provide funding as well as laboratory help in developing the drug.

SUIT AGAINST TRW DISMISSED BY JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TRW Inc. said Monday that a Wyoming federal judge has set aside a $290,000 
judgment and dismissed a lawsuit brought by a consumer who had alleged that 
errors in his TRW credit report led to rejection of his application for a car 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Clarence A. Brimmer last month 
after TRW discovered new evidence that showed that Paul K. Jacques' credit 
report was accurate, and not inaccurate as he had claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques had argued that TRW had put negative information on his credit report 
that actually belonged to his father. TRW, whose credit reporting unit is based 
in Orange, found that the negative information actually belonged to the Wyoming 
plaintiff.

 ICN Investment: Viratek Inc., a subsidiary of Costa Mesa-based drug giant ICN 
Pharmaceuticals Inc., is starting off the new year with a promise to 
shareholders that it will get more buck for its bang. 
</P>
<P>
 The research and development company Monday said that it has sent a letter to 
shareholders, telling them that it is sinking some $6 million into 26 separate 
clinical trials, including tests to find cures for several types of cancer, 
bronchitis and several strains of hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
 The company hopes to parlay that investment into millions more as new drugs or 
new ways to use drugs already on the market eventually find their way into 
pharmacies, hospitals and clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notable test this year will be the final phase of trials to 
eventually receive approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for 
Virazole as a treatment for debilitating hepatitis C in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug is currently sold in 47 countries, including the United States, 
eastern and western Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America for various 
uses. 
</P>
<P>
 It is primarily used by U.S. doctors to fight RSV, a form of pneumonia that 
can be fatal to infants. It is also being used under a special FDA guideline to 
treat hantavirus, the often-deadly, rodent-borne disease that struck the 
Southwest last year, killing at least 27 people.

BECKMAN INSTRUMENTS REPORTS $37.6-MILLION LOSS AFTER CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beckman Instruments Inc. said it lost $37.6 million in 1993 after taking a 
$115-million charge against the cost of a two-year restructuring program that 
will lop about 800 jobs from its worldwide payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the charge -- the largest of two annual charges the company plans to 
take -- Beckman earned $46.8 million from ongoing operations, up nearly 7% from 
$43.8 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual loss amounts to $1.35 per share, compared to a profit of $1.53 a 
share, or $43.8 million, in 1992. To fully account for the costs of the 
restructuring, which it announced in October, Beckman said it will take a 
further $20-million charge this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the medical instruments maker said Monday that about 350 of 
the jobs to be cut will come from the company's California operations and will 
result from a combination of an early-retirement plan, normal attrition and, if 
necessary, layoffs. The remaining jobs will be cut from payrolls in the 
company's divisions in Europe, which has been hard hit by a recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifics of the job cut plan have not been made public. Beckman has 6,600 
employees, including 4,500 in the United State. Of those, 1,700 are in Orange 
County at the corporate headquarters and bio-technology instrumentation 
facility in Fullerton and a diagnostics instruments plant in Brea; and 1,110 
are in Northern California, predominantly at Beckman's Palo Alto research and 
manufacturing plant for its centrifuge division. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckman officials said a number of other jobs, mostly in Europe, will be 
affected by the restructuring as positions are transferred among locations. "We 
expect that many of the people will not want to transfer," said spokesman Jay 
Steffenhagen. "Those jobs will be filled, but the people holding them will 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's financial report held no surprises, said John Putnam, a medical 
technology analyst with the Alex. Brown & Sons investment research company. 
"They announced their reorganization in October, so the charge was anticipated. 
It is part of what the good companies are doing in the health care area right 
now. They are getting costs under control to reflect an evolving environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Louis T. Rosso, Beckman's chairman and chief executive, said Monday that the 
company expects its reorganization to "begin paying dividends with significant 
savings in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Beckman is shifting focus to its medical diagnostics and centrifuge devices 
operations. "We are putting our investment in our bio-technology businesses, 
because that is the fastest-growing part" of the market, Steffenhagen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales for the company's U.S. diagnostic systems unit grew 5%. Beckman 
officials have said that the restructuring is a response to numerous factors 
including the European recession and medical cost containment efforts overseas 
and in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the recession in Europe lowered the value of many currencies when 
converted to U.S. dollars, Beckman said its annual sales dropped 3.6% to $875.7 
million from $908.8 million in 1992. Had currency values remained unchanged 
from 1992 levels, the company said, its sales would have increased by about 1%. 
Beckman Reports Loss 
</P>
<P>
 Beckman Instruments Inc. reported a $67-million loss for the fourth quarter, 
giving the company a $37.6-million loss for 1993. The company attributed the 
shortfall to a one-time, $115-million restructuring charge. Figures are in 
millions of dollars except data per share: 05,19,09,09,11,11 4th qtr 4th qtr 12

 Rafi M. Khan, the disgruntled shareholder who is trying to oust the board of 
ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. and its chairman, Milan Panic, filed a $210-million 
libel suit Monday against the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Khan alleges 
that the newspaper has run a series of erroneous articles beginning in October, 
when Khan and ICN officials were in the heat of a proxy battle.That battle is 
expected to reach a conclusion on Feb. 1, when the Costa Mesa pharmaceuticals 
company holds its annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan alleges in his suit that New York Times business writer Susan Antilla 
wrote "maliciously libelous" statements about him. Among other things, 
Antilla's stories said that Khan was fined for stock fraud in Canada in 1974, 
was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission and did special favors for 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan denies all of those statements, calling them baseless. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Times Executive Editor Sally Hoffmeister, also named in the suit, 
would not comment Monday, referring inquiries to the newspaper's public 
relations office. That office did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan, a stockbroker who once touted ICN shares, has been trying since March to 
unseat Panic, who is a former prime minister of Yugoslavia. Khan alleges that 
Panic and the rest of the company's top management are not in tune with 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN officials, however, say that Khan is a stock promoter with a shady 
reputation. The company successfully forced Khan into a hearing on whether he 
was a fugitive from Scotland Yard. A New York judge has asked federal 
authorities to investigate Khan to find out if he lied on the stand or is 
fleeing British law. 
</P>
<P>
 That investigation is ongoing.

JUDGE ORDERS SPLIT OF KEATING ASSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge on Monday told lawyers for the government and for those 
involved in civil lawsuits against Charles H. Keating Jr. to work out a plan 
for splitting his assets and to return to court Feb. 28 for her approval. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer in Los Angeles delayed until then a 
ruling on forfeiting the assets of the one-time operator of Lincoln Savings & 
Loan, which became the nation's costliest thrift failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating stands to lose six lots in Canada, two cars, numerous bank and 
securities accounts, furniture and other personal property as a result of his 
year-old conviction for racketeering, fraud and conspiracy stemming from the 
1989 collapse of the Irvine thrift.

FROM VIETNAM REFUGEES TO HER EXTENDED FAMILY; RELATIONSHIPS: COUNSELOR ANNE-THU 
PHAM OF SANTA ANA KEEPS IN TOUCH WITH MANY OF THE AMERASIANS SHE MET 5 YEARS 
AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Anne-Thu Pham heard the boy singing a song in perfect Vietnamese, she was 
impressed. His looks seemed very "American" to her, so she complimented him in 
English on his command of her native language. But the boy merely stared at 
her. Irritated, Anne-Thu muttered to herself in Vietnamese, "How rude!" 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's face brightened. In Vietnamese, he quickly apologized, explaining 
that he did not speak English. The boy, an Amerasian from Vietnam, had just 
arrived at the Philippines Refugee Processing Center where Anne-Thu had begun 
working as a counselor.  
</P>
<P>
 That was five years ago. Since then, Anne-Thu, 29, of Santa Ana has met 
hundreds of Amerasians who look "American" but are Vietnamese. Still, she has 
never forgotten the boy she heard singing in the refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Hai Duy Pham. Now 21, he is a college student in Kent, Wash. He is 
one of about 35 former refugees who have become part of Anne-Thu's extended 
family. She calls them "my Amerasian kids." They call her aunt or sister. And 
although most of them are now scattered across the United States, Anne-Thu 
keeps in touch with them by letter and by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as Hai, who spent several days recently with the Anne-Thu's family, 
plan their vacations so they can visit. Occasionally Anne-Thu also visits them. 
"I've made a deal with all of them that when they graduate, I'd go to their 
graduation wherever it is," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She kept that promise when Hai graduated from high school. And when he got 
ready to enroll at college, he asked her to go to Washington to help him 
register. "He said, 'I don't think I can go to college. Can you help me?' So, I 
went." 
</P>
<P>
 Anne-Thu is proud of Hai's accomplishments, but Hai is quick to give Anne-Thu 
credit. "I went to college because of her," says Hai, who now speaks fluent 
English. "I planned to go to work one year and then back to college, but she 
told me, 'No, that's not a good plan.' I trust her judgment and know that she 
cares about me." 
</P>
<P>
 During Hai's recent visit, another of the refugees Anne-Thu keeps in touch 
with came to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Phong Tran, 20, from San Jose, drove all night so that he could spend a day or 
two visiting with Hai and Anne-Thu before returning to his job at a furniture 
store.  
</P>
<P>
 While the two young men were here, Anne-Thu, who now works as a youth and 
family counselor for the Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc., took them 
to one of the local schools where she counsels students and showed them off. 
"They are my pride and joy," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anne-Thu's original commitment as a guidance counselor to the Amerasian 
youngsters in the Philippines was for six months.  
</P>
<P>
 She never imagined that she would establish such long-term personal 
relationships with so many of them. And she has a hard time explaining even to 
her own family why she cares so much for young immigrants such as Hai and 
Phong. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother yells at me a lot because I volunteer a lot," says Anne-Thu, who 
lives with her parents and two younger sisters. "Vietnamese have a 
misconception that Amerasians are bad kids," she says. "But I don't think so."  
</P>
<P>
 Anne-Thu's own family -- including her Vietnamese parents and seven sisters 
and three brothers -- came to America 18 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 The sons and daughters of Vietnamese women and American men stationed in 
Vietnam during the war began coming to America in 1988 as a result of the 
Amerasian Homecoming Act, which made them eligible for quick resettlement in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then about 2,000 have settled in Orange County's Little Saigon area of 
Westminster, according to Peter Daniels, coordinator of Amerasian Services at 
St. Anselm's Cross Cultural Community Center in Garden Grove. Thousands more 
have settled in other parts of the country.  
</P>
<P>
 In the years following the Vietnam War, Amerasian children lived in Vietnam as 
impoverished castaways, rejects in a society that referred to them as "the dust 
of life."  
</P>
<P>
 The Amerasian Homecoming Act was designed offer the children a better life in 
America, however, it had the unintended side effect of turning some into a 
commodity. Families who wanted to move to the United States would often pay 
gold for the opportunity to pose as part of the Amerasian's family so they 
could accompany the youngster to the U.S. The Amerasians who were traded upon 
in this way became known as "gold children." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Amerasians had little formal education in Vietnam, some were ill-treated, 
and many "gold children" were abandoned once they arrived in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne-Thu recalls one gold child who moved to America, only to be kicked out by 
his "parents" after he became too old to qualify for government aid. "I gave 
him my address and I said, 'No matter what happens, contact me,' " she says. 
"His family abused him, so he contacted my family, and my family told me about 
it. I knew he had uncles here, and they took him in."  
</P>
<P>
 At the refugee center in the Philippines, Anne-Thu says, she was never sure 
whether an Amerasian was with his real parents or his "gold" parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Vietnam, Amerasians encountered prejudice because they were of mixed 
heritage. And in the United States, many have discovered that prejudice still 
exists, according to Anne-Thu. She recalls taking a sister-in-law, who is 
Amerasian, to English classes recently. "I enrolled her in a class, and she is 
the only Amerasian in the class. The others say, 'Get all Amerasians away. They 
are nothing but troublemakers."' 
</P>
<P>
 But Anne-Thu says that attitude is changing, especially as Vietnamese 
immigrants become "Americanized" and intermarry. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, she cites her own family. "My niece and nephew are Amerasians," 
she says. And even though Anne-Thu's brother has since divorced, she says her 
niece and nephew will always be part of the family. "Once they are in our 
family, they are in for life," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Amerasians often do not look Vietnamese, many have a hard time fitting 
into the Vietnamese community. And because many do not speak English, they can 
have an equally hard time fitting into American culture. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Phong still does not speak English very well and often does not 
understand when English-speaking people ask him questions. "I really scold 
him," says Anne-Thu. "I said, 'Phong, you can't speak English and you don't 
look Vietnamese. You're going to be the owner of a business one of these days, 
but you cannot communicate. What kind of future are you going to have?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Anne-Thu's prodding, Phong, who did not finish high school, has 
promised to work on his English so that he can get a GED. "She calls me and 
checks up on me," he says with a smile. "I never met a good sister like her." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Phong and Hai rely on Anne-Thu for advice. "I sometimes call her and ask 
her who am I going to be in the future," says Hai, who is searching for his 
American father. And, if he gets serious about a girlfriend, Hai says he'll ask 
Anne-Thu what she thinks.  
</P>
<P>
 "They trust me more than their families," Anne-Thu says matter-of-factly. "I 
really stick with them, and I really help them out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Anne-Thu heard that one of her Amerasian kids had dropped out of school 
and joined a gang, she called him and had a heart-to-heart talk. "I got very 
upset," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she is still concerned about him, she says that the boy has since 
gotten out of the gang and into a good job. "Once a month I call and check up 
on him to see what is going on," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-distance phone calls and trips to attend high school graduations are part 
of the necessary expenses of having a continuing relationship with so many of 
the young refugees, Anne-Thu says. "I talk to my mom a lot about my Amerasian 
kids. Sometimes she gets mad because I spend a lot of money on travel." 
</P>
<P>
 But, for the most part, her family is supportive of her continuing 
relationships with the young people she met in the Philippines. In her wallet, 
she carries photos of her Amerasian kids alongside photos of her own family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here," she says, taking out a photo of a beautiful teen-age girl. "This is 
one of my kids who lives in Mississippi." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl will graduate from high school this summer, and Anne-Thu plans to 
attend the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look what she wrote on the back," Anne-Thu says with a proud smile. 
</P>
<P>
 On the back of the picture, in English, the girl wrote: "I always pray to God 
and God has answered by bringing you to me. Don't worry because no matter what 
I do in my future, you will always be the first person to know. I promise that 
I will never forgetting you."

GETTING THE JOBS DONE; THE REVIEW: 'RUHR-ORT' AIMS TO FUSE IMPRESSIONS OF THE 
GERMAN INDUSTRIAL HEARTLAND WITH A FEMINIST APPRAISAL OF THE WORKERS FROM THAT 
REGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The structuralist, task-oriented modern dance that evolved in the 1970s meets 
the hyperathletic, object-obsessed movement metaphor of the '90s in "RUHR-ORT" 
("A Place Called the Ruhr"), an ambitious, 70-minute male septet by German 
choreographer Susanne Linke. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented Sunday in the brand-new Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts 
Center at Cal State Long Beach -- and perfect for the stadium-style anonymity 
of that 1,162-seat venue -- "RUHR-ORT" aims to fuse impressions of the German 
industrial heartland with a feminist appraisal of the workers from that region. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins with the ominous mechanical clatter and rumble of Ludger Brummer's 
soundscore, followed by the dimmest, smokiest glimpses imaginable of a bleak 
workplace designed by Frank Leimbach. Soon, Linke's men are climbing ladders, 
pounding a metal platform with sledgehammers and moving heavy steel ingots to 
the rhythm of quasi-military cadences, with time off for fishing, fistfights 
and a communal shower. 
</P>
<P>
 In one segment, her dancers may portray workers operating a machine; in the 
next, they'll become the machine itself or competitors from the sports world, 
or prison inmates or army recruits in training. Running-in-place becomes a 
central image, with the runner sometimes collapsed forward, holding himself off 
the floor on clenched fists. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilfred Kreisiment's stark overhead and side lighting enhances the sense of 
weight and the desperate camaraderie of what Linke portrays as a dual 
"Gotterdammerung": both an industrial apocalypse and the last gasp of brute 
masculinity. 
</P>
<P>
 Without seeing her companion "Frauenballett" ("Woman's Ballet") of 1981, it's 
impossible to judge fairly her political stance, although she seems to give men 
points for sheer endurance and certainly includes enough vignettes depicting 
exhaustion and fearful isolation to absolve these men of any complicity in 
creating the living hell on view. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also probably unfair to complain that "RUHR-ORT" recapitulates the 
achievements of a whole modernist sub-genre -- with glints of the stagecraft 
and thematic preoccupations of everything from Twyla Tharp's "Fait Accompli" to 
Lin Hixson's Goat Island repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Linke and her collaborators give us not a personal vision of the 
Ruhr so much as the house style of the Frankfurt Ballet under William Forsythe. 
Elsewhere, the workers she wants to evoke vanish and what we see is merely a 
grandiose Teutonic gloss on the great American postmodernists. 
</P>
<P>
 Troublesome as this sense of deja vu may be, it in no way diminishes the 
remarkable power and dedication of the cast: Reinhold Behling, Urs Dietrich, 
Ari Fastman, Karsten Itterbeck, Avi Kaiser, Henry Montes and Thomas Stich.

REPORT OF SETTLEMENT SURPRISES JACKSON FANS; LEGAL: SOME BELIEVE PAYMENT WOULD 
BE AN ADMISSION OF GUILT, OTHERS SAY HE WANTS TO GET ON WITH HIS MUSIC. BUT CAN 
HIS CAREER SURVIVE THE CONTROVERSY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Startled by reports that Michael Jackson is near a monetary settlement with 
the 14-year-old boy who has accused the star of molesting him, fans, radio 
programmers, celebrity publicists and professional scandal-watchers debated 
Monday what such a move would mean for the superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those interviewed expressed surprise at the reported eight-figure 
settlement since Jackson had recently vowed on national TV to prove his 
innocence, but still felt his career would survive the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you pay a settlement (in a case like this) I think most people perceive 
it as an admission of guilt," said Tom Joyner, a syndicated radio host whose 
show is heard on Los Angeles station KACE-FM and in more than 30 other urban 
markets. "Personally I feel it is an admission, but if it is, I'm still a fan." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Joyner and his band, Uncle Butchie and the Live House, recently 
recorded a song in support of Jackson, "We Believe in You," and he said that 
the latest chapter in the matter does not diminish that sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I said when we did the song that if the accusations turned out to be true, we 
still stand by the song, which simply says that we support him. I even support 
him more if he's guilty, because he needs support from people like us so he can 
get help and get back to being the entertainer we all know and love." 
</P>
<P>
 The general feeling was that an innocent person would not pay such a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was innocent of a charge like this, I'd fight it like hell," said Ken 
Schlessler, the author of "This Is Hollywood," a guide to show-biz scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlessler notes that past scandals, such as those involving early filmmaker 
Fatty Arbuckle, rocker Jerry Lee Lewis and director Roman Polanski, hurt their 
careers.  
</P>
<P>
 Arbuckle, though acquitted of charges of murder and rape in 1921, was ruined 
professionally. Lewis, poised for superstardom when he legally married his 
13-year-old cousin, was blackballed in the music industry in the late '50s and 
early '60s, before re-emerging as a major attraction in country rock. Polanski, 
sentenced in 1977 for having intercourse with a minor, fled the United States 
and although he has continued to make high-profile movies has never fulfilled 
the promise of his early career. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson, he said, may well survive this episode no matter what the public 
perception is, due to the magnitude of his stardom and the current social 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got too many fans who believe in him," he said. "And moral standards are 
not what they were even 10 years ago. People are bombarded with this on TV . . 
. it's sensational one day and the next it's old news and you go on to the next 
scandal." 
</P>
<P>
 James Miller, manager of the Tempo Records store on Crenshaw Boulevard, 
concurs. "This is the '90s and things that would have killed an artist in the 
'50s and '40s don't now. The attitude is that if that's his lifestyle, that's 
his lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller notes that though the charges against Jackson continue to be a big 
topic among customers, it hasn't cut into sales of his albums and videos.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there's a feeling that the settlement, even if construed as an 
admission of guilt, would allow Jackson to get going again as an artist because 
he would avoid fighting the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, it's seen by Jackson fans as a matter of expediency. At the 
National Assn. of Music Merchandisers convention in Anaheim on Monday, Jerry 
Jones, a guitar maker from Nashville, said, "It sounds like a no-win situation 
to me. As a businessman I can understand it's sometimes best to bail out of a 
situation. It doesn't change my opinion. I think he's a great entertainer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Duncan, program director of KYSR-FM (STAR 98.7), said that the story is 
growing old for his audience. That, he said, not the question of what Jackson 
may or may not have done, is what's hurting him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our research has shown that people are tired of hearing about it and the 
appeal of his music has diminished a little," he said. "If anything, (the 
settlement) keeps him in business, whereas if a jury found him guilty, he'd be 
out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, some feel the public will find this an unsatisfactory 
conclusion to the story.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's anticlimactic," said Dana Kennedy, who has covered the scandal for 
Entertainment Weekly magazine. "If there was going to be a settlement, why not 
back in August? They could have saved a lot of grief. But if nothing ever comes 
out in trial and charges are never brought out in criminal court, it will just 
fade." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Van Buskirk, senior features editor for US magazine, agrees. "This 
isn't so much an admission of guilt as an admission of him just wanting it all 
to go away," she said. "And as much as people want to believe the worst, they 
also want to believe the best. Everybody knows (the reported eight-figure 
settlement) is not a lot of money for him." 
</P>
<P>
 But many feel that the very fact of his wealth and vulnerability itself may 
draw out the matter further. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another boy could easily come forward saying, 'Hey, he just got millions,' " 
said KYSR's Duncan. "If there are other victims you can bet this won't be the 
only check he's writing. I don't think this will even be totally dead."

Q&A WITH JIMMY SMITS AND WANDA DE JESUS; TAKING A 'MAIDEN' VOYAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Smits and Wanda De Jesu s, an offstage couple for more than eight years, 
play an onstage couple in "Death and the Maiden," the Ariel Dorfman political 
thriller opening Thursday at the Mark Taper Forum.  
</P>
<P>
 Smits, best known as Victor Sifuentes on "L.A. Law," portrays another lawyer, 
this time in an unnamed South American country. When he brings home a stranger 
he has met on the road, his wife -- played by De Jesu s -- is convinced that 
their new acquaintance is the doctor who tortured her under the country's 
former military regime. De Jesus has performed on Broadway, Off Broadway and in 
Los Angeles at the Ahmanson and has been a series regular on "Mariah" and 
"Santa Barbara." * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Was your concentration on this play affected by the earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
 WDJ: It took me at least a day to get back into the mind-set. 
</P>
<P>
 JS: I do think that what this woman (in the play) has gone through is a kind 
of trauma. The trauma we suffered in the last couple of days. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 WDJ: Only feeds the play on some minor level. The feelings of being powerless 
and not knowing what's going to happen next. 
</P>
<P>
 JS: So as the director would say, "Use it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: When this play was done on Broadway, Equity protested the non-Latino 
cast. Is it important for the cast to be Latino? 
</P>
<P>
 JS: Although it takes place in any country in South America that has gone 
through a democratization process after an oppressive government, the wonderful 
aspect of the play is that it does speak to South Africa, Bosnia, Germany after 
the Second World War -- anyplace there has been that kind of repression. 
Inherent in the fact that we are Latino actors, we do bring a sense of our own 
culture to it. Our take on it is different. It's much more politically 
oriented, much more. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 WDJ: About the passion of the political realities the people live with. There 
are certain textures of the culture that we understand. But it shouldn't be an 
issue. It's important that people see the universality. It would be nice if 
people who come to the theater don't say "That's a great Latino cast," but that 
"these are good actors." 
</P>
<P>
 JS: An actor tries to be versatile, to immerse himself in a different culture. 
But what was at issue with the people who protested is that the playing field 
is not equal. So why not be in control of at least your own image, of something 
that speaks to your own culture? But then there is the whole artist's 
sensibility. We're actors. We should be able to. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 WDJ: Imagine and create. But this is not an ideal world. There are many 
projects that are Latino and haven't been cast that way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: The United States is not an ex-dictatorship. How do the play's 
issues speak to us? 
</P>
<P>
 JS: Just on a humanistic level, it's something I hope people are concerned 
about. And although the play doesn't really deal with this aspect, I hope 
audiences acknowledge that this government, albeit indirectly, supported a lot 
of these repressive regimes in the name of keeping communism out of our back 
door. We tend to think of World War II and all the atrocities that happened, 
and people say "Never again." But these things are still happening. The Amnesty 
International files are big. 
</P>
<P>
 WDJ: On a more human level, it's a play about silence and accommodations, 
about denials, how those who have been victimized may or may not have recourse 
to go and get help or be acknowledged. Torture is an abuse of power, and that 
happens here -- be it that of women, racial tensions, police beating or 
Reginald Denny beating. 
</P>
<P>
 JS: But at its best the play does function on this did-he-do-it level. 
</P>
<P>
 WDJ: As far as I'm concerned, he did it! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You're speaking on behalf of your character? 
</P>
<P>
 JS: The arguments from each character's point of view are fairly strong. 
</P>
<P>
 WDJ: In the construction of the play the ambiguity is there, but I'm fighting 
for my life to convince (the others) that this is not just that I'm being 
hysterical or crazy or emotional, that this really did happen. And that's the 
struggle that's going on in these countries. 
</P>
<P>
 JS: For the first couple of weeks we were immersed. Wanda had taken tapes home 
-- she's got a VCR in the dressing room. There was a point where I couldn't do 
it any more. We would rehearse lines at home and then she would say, "I'm going 
to watch my tapes now." I would go "OK." I guess we internalized a lot of the 
character. Because that's what happens with this particular man. He doesn't 
want to deal. 
</P>
<P>
 WDJ: "Tape time -- OK, honey, I'll see you later." 
</P>
<P>
 JS: You could hear in the bedroom these sounds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 WDJ: Of the women who were struggling to find the disappeared. Those women are 
heart-wrenching. They look very weak, but they're very strong. These women are 
true heroines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Were you cast here as a unit? As a package? 
</P>
<P>
 WDJ: Absolutely not. Let's get this clear for the record. Please, Jimmy, 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
 JS: Both Wanda and I have worked with (the play's director) Bob Egan before. 
I've been talking about "going back to my roots and doing theater." It became 
like a line. Agents said, "You've got to keep the (screen) momentum going." 
Last summer, I told Wanda I'd try to block out some time. But then Wanda was 
cast to do this same show at Arizona Theatre Company. 
</P>
<P>
 WDJ: The role was offered, and I was ready to pack. 
</P>
<P>
 JS: I was going to do a replacement job on Broadway. Please don't ask (which 
show). 
</P>
<P>
 WDJ: (to Smits) Then (The Taper) spoke to you about (this play). For some 
reason (Egan) opened up auditions for a couple of people. I came in because I 
was ready to do it somewhere else. He made his decision as a director. So no, 
we were not a prepackaged deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Would you have been willing to do it without Wanda? 
</P>
<P>
 JS: The fact she's involved is a major reason for doing it. I do like the 
play, and we've wanted to work together. It just hasn't worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You two are not married? 
</P>
<P>
 WDJ: It'll happen. We know why the institution of marriage. It's been good. In 
many respects it's a commitment. Are you committed, honey? 
</P>
<P>
 JS: It's an ongoing discussion. It'll happen.

MUSEUMS SHAKE, ARTWORKS SAFE; ART: INSTITUTIONS SUFFER FEW DAMAGES IN 
EARTHQUAKE BECAUSE OF AN OBSESSION WITH SAFETY MEASURES. PRECAUTIONS PAY OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Part of the commotion heard by Southern Californians in the wee hours of Jan. 
17 was the sound of artworks turning into rubble. When the earth quaked, 
paintings jumped off walls, sculptures took a tumble, ceramics cracked and 
glass shattered in hundreds of residences, offices and galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground shook under art museums too, but the results were strikingly 
different. When local museum administrators and staff rushed in to assess the 
damage, they found that only a few of the hundreds of thousands of works in 
their collections were in need of repair -- and fewer still were destroyed or 
seriously damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 What made the difference? An obsession with the safety of artworks. Museum 
collections are protected by everything from high-tech methods such as 
shake-table tests and isolator bases -- complex mechanical devices that can 
absorb up to 80% of ground movement while allowing sculptures to remain 
relatively still -- to adhesive wax and bubble wrap. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the J. Paul Getty Museum's 7 1/2-foot limestone and marble statue 
of Aphrodite didn't budge from its place of honor, and entire cases of fragile 
Greek vases, ancient sculptures, glass and ceramics were completely unscathed 
at the villa in Malibu. The access panel to electrical controls above one 
display case was hanging by a single screw after the quake, but the artworks 
were in perfect order. A marble bust of a Roman boxer rotated on its mount and 
struck its pedestal, chipping a shoulder.  
</P>
<P>
 Even a freak incident that might have been a disaster ended well. In that 
case, a marble head that normally sits atop a Roman statue -- lodged in place 
by an elongated neckpiece that fits into the figure's chest cavity -- shot into 
the air and landed on the floor about seven feet away. The damage? "A chip in 
the forehead that can be repaired," said Jerry Podany, the Getty's antiquities 
conservator.  
</P>
<P>
 The story was much the same at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, although 
the damage incurred was more severe. A larger than life-size sandstone figure 
from Cambodia, a Buddhist sculpture from Thailand, an Italian wood statue of 
St. Catherine and an Italian marble vase decorated with mosaic horses all fell 
from their bases and sustained serious fractures, while a contemporary glass 
and metal sculpture by Howard Ben Tre appears to have been broken beyond 
repair. About a dozen sculptures require first aid and others need to be 
remounted, but no artworks were harmed in gallery after gallery of 
pre-Columbian ceramics, ancient glass, porcelain, paintings and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Southwest Museum, which resides in an 80-year-old building on Mt. 
Washington, the temblor rearranged display cases, threw 500 books on the floor 
of the library and opened cracks in walls that had been patched after previous 
earthquakes but only broke 11 pieces of pottery out of a 12,000-piece ceramics 
collection. The most valuable casualty was a Zia bowl, worth about $4,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Still other museums -- including the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Norton 
Simon Museum, the Huntington Library and Galleries, the Santa Monica Museum and 
the Armand Hammer Museum -- reported no damage to artworks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's astonishing," Sara Campbell, director of the Norton Simon Museum, said 
of the institutions' collective good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, her colleagues all across Southern California are mightily relieved 
that their collections came through the quake so safely. But no one is chalking 
it up to an accident or a miracle. Although some museum officials have 
particularly sturdy buildings or fortuitous locations to thank, all are reaping 
the rewards of having taken precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has any excuse (for being unprepared)," said Pieter Meyers, chief of 
conservation at LACMA. "We all knew an earthquake would come; we just didn't 
know when or how strong it would be. The measures we used for earthquake 
mitigation worked almost beyond our expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 During the last decade Southern California conservators, scientists and 
technicians have reconsidered the risk to virtually every object in their 
museums' collections, upgrading the mounts, pedestals and hanging devices of 
works on display and improving methods of storage. Leading the way -- with the 
help of the Getty Conservation Institute and structural engineers from USC and 
the firm of Lindvall-Richter -- the Getty Museum has carried out a 10-year 
program to strengthen its building, establish emergency procedures and train 
the staff to carry them out, study earthquake risks to artworks and install new 
protective devices. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a big effort for us. It has been a top priority," said Deborah 
Gribbon, associate director and chief curator of the Getty.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One place the effort paid off was at a Santa Monica high-rise, where the J. 
Paul Getty Trust leases space for several of its programs and stores the 
museum's vast collection of photographs, Gribbon said. The photographs are 
stored in acid-free boxes, in a shelf system designed by Bruce Metro, head of 
the museum's preparation and machine shop. Without those shelves, which are 
tipped backward (into the walls) and lined with skid-proof foam, some of the 
boxes would surely have fallen into water from a broken pipe, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the photographs remained on their shelves, security officers 
covered them with plastic and within a few hours staff members had dried the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Getty's photograph storage is only one example of the new world of 
earthquake protection for artworks. At museums all around Southern California, 
paintings and other framed objects are fitted with hard rubber bumpers and 
heavy duty hardware that attaches to wall hooks or suspension wires. Vessels 
and small sculptures are tethered to display cases by monofilament (plastic 
fishing line) or attached to shelves with microcrystalline wax and form-fitting 
brackets. Larger sculptures are bolted or wired to bases that are loaded with 
25-pound lead bricks to lower their centers of gravity, then set on Teflon pads 
so that they will slide instead of tipping over. Particularly vulnerable and 
valuable sculptures, such as the Getty's Aphrodite statue, are installed on 
isolator bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these devices go unnoticed by the public. While the wax and 
monofilament that saved thousands of glass and ceramic objects in the recent 
quake are nearly invisible, unsightly cables, weights and isolators are tucked 
away in pedestals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of aesthetics versus physics," as Meyers puts it. And the 
problem of protecting art without impinging on its visual appeal can lead to 
heated arguments between conservators and curators. Saving Ben Tre's sculpture 
from destruction would have meant installing it with an obtrusive mount, he 
said, so the museum took a calculated risk. But the piece might have been lost 
anyway because of inherent weakness in its engineering, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the generously endowed Getty, where conservators Podany and Brian Considine 
work with technicians Mark Mitton and George Johnson to ensure the safety of 
the collection, mechanisms that prevent sculptures and other three-dimensional 
objects from toppling to destruction are particularly ingenious and well 
crafted. Shelves holding Greek vases are suspended by free swinging metal rods 
in plexiglass cases that sit on isolators. In the gallery of Cycladic art, 
sculptures appear to float, while a lid that seems to lean against a stone 
vessel is actually held in place by transparent wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's something I was really worried about," Podany said, pointing out a 
life-size Roman statue of Apollo that has no visible means of support. "But 
when the earthquake came, it did its stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 "It" in this case is a system of thin stainless cable that runs through the 
marble sculpture's legs. The cable attaches the figure to an isolator, hidden 
behind marble panels that flip back when the earth trembles. A replica of the 
sculpture and its support system had been tested on a shake table with 
promising results. 
</P>
<P>
 As they assess the nature of the earthquake and the damage it wrought, 
conservators say that some problems can be explained while others are puzzling. 
The County Museum apparently sustained its heaviest jolt in the southwest 
corner of the top floor of the Ahmanson wing where the fallen Asian sculptures 
once stood side by side. The large Cambodian figure should have been placed on 
an isolator, Meyers said, but funds weren't been available.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the smaller sculpture from Thailand, Meyers said he saw no inherent 
problem in the way it was displayed, so it must have been hit extremely hard. 
The same is true of the marble vase, which yanked its metal bracket out of its 
pedestal when it fell. The demise of the Southwest Museum's Zia pot also is a 
mystery because it was one of 20 or so that are installed identically. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whittier earthquake in 1987 destroyed 208 pieces of pottery at the 
Southwest Museum, Wilson said, and most of them fell from storage shelves in 
the museum's tower. Soon afterward, every fragile item in storage was sheathed 
in bubble wrap or Styrofoam, put in a cardboard box and set back on the metal 
shelves with cotton webbing tied across open spaces to prevent the boxes from 
falling.

CBS' OLYMPIC GOLD; TELEVISION: NETWORK, WHICH SOLD 95% OF ITS ADVERTISING TIME 
BEFORE THE ATTACK ON NANCY KERRIGAN, EXPECTS TO TURN A PROFIT WITH COVERAGE OF 
WINTER GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 CBS expects to make a profit with its TV coverage of the Winter Olympics next 
month, and not because of heightened public interest in the ladies figure 
skating competition following the attack on U.S. figure skater Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the network had sold about 95% of the advertising time before the Jan. 
6 assault in which the ex-husband and bodyguard of Kerrigan rival Tonya Harding 
have been implicated. CBS' Olympic advertising sales plan bundles commercial 
time in packages, giving sponsors spots at different times of the day, rather 
than in specific slots or sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, the network could not have profited from the attack on Kerrigan 
without overhauling its plan and risking offending already committed sponsors, 
said George Schweitzer, the CBS Broadcast Group's senior vice president for 
marketing and communications. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are at least two ways that CBS does figure to benefit from the 
attack on Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the network has scheduled a prime-time special Feb. 5, one week before 
the Olympics begin, featuring exhibitions by Kerrigan and other top skaters 
taped a day earlier. That will be her first performance in front of spectators 
since the attack. CBS expects the ads to sell out for that show and is looking 
forward to high ratings.  
</P>
<P>
 Second, with CBS having won the bidding earlier this month for the exclusive 
U.S. television rights for the 1998 Winter Games, the network figures to be 
able to sell commercial time for that event at higher rates because of the 
anticipated higher ratings for next month's competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feb. 5 exhibition came about after the network was approached by ProServe, 
the Arlington, Va.-based sports marketing, management and television company 
that represents Kerrigan. CBS is paying an undisclosed fee to ProServe for the 
broadcast rights. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS said it also has an agreement with Kerrigan and ProServe for prospective 
post-Olympic events with her. Figure skating, for example, may be an element in 
CBS' Sunday sports programming this fall as a replacement for the National 
Football League games it lost to Fox Broadcasting, and Kerrigan would be a 
likely participant. 
</P>
<P>
 Network officials and advertising executives say the prospects for CBS turning 
a profit on the Feb. 12-27 games -- it reportedly broke even two years ago -- 
are due to a variety of factors: the improved economy, the fact that these are 
the year's only Olympics, the ratings and production success for CBS' coverage 
of the 1992 Games (its first Olympics since 1960) and the continued trend of 
rising interest in the Winter Olympics in general, plus the Winter Olympics' 
unique ability to draw certain hard-to-reach viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a significant amount of new money from advertisers who were in the 
Summer Olympics last time, but not the Winter Olympics," Schweitzer said, 
citing as examples IBM, Xerox, Nestle, Lee Jeans and the John Hancock insurance 
firm. "We were able to get more money this year versus two years ago from less 
advertisers, (because the advertisers) are spending more money. Two years ago, 
we had to cut our prices dramatically to fill up the time. This year, we're 
going to have more demand than time." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the stand-alone nature of these Olympics, the first to benefit 
from an October, 1986, International Olympic Committee vote to place the Winter 
Olympics in the even-numbered year between the Summer Games, instead of holding 
them in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have the year's one major sporting event gives you a big advantage in 
selling it," said David Poltrack, the CBS Broadcast Group's senior vice 
president for planning and research. "In 1992, there was confusion among some 
viewers when, during Christmas week, NBC was promoting its TripleCast and a lot 
of people thought the Winter Olympics were going to be on pay-per-view." 
</P>
<P>
 Poltrack also pointed out that these Winter Olympics won't have to compete 
with the so-called Dream Team of National Basketball Assn. stars who were to 
compete for the first time in the 1992 Summer Olympics, who were already being 
hyped in the weeks prior to the 1992 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the ratings for this year's games, CBS has guaranteed advertisers it 
will average an 18.6 rating for its prime-time coverage, with each point 
representing 942,000 homes. (The guarantee was set about 18 months ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Winter Olympics are one of the few examples of television programming to 
record higher ratings in an environment of increasing choices that has led to 
falling ratings for nearly all other programming. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1984 Winter Games, carried by ABC and held in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, 
averaged a 15 rating in prime time. The 1988 Games, carried live by ABC from 
Calgary, Canada had a 19.3. CBS' coverage of the 1992 Games from Albertville, 
France averaged an 18.7. (The prime-time coverage of both the 1984 and 1992 
games was seen on a delayed basis in the United States because of the time 
difference with Europe. Next month's games, which will take place in 
Lillehammer, Norway, will also be carried on a delayed basis here.) 
</P>
<P>
 Figure skating has been the sport that has keyed the ratings increase. In the 
1988 Games, the coverage of the long performances, featuring the duel between 
American Debi Thomas and eventual two-time gold medalist Katarina Witt of the 
former East Germany, received a 26.4 rating, the highest for a Saturday night 
program since the next-to-last night of ABC's epic "Roots" miniseries 11 years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the ladies long performance drew a 25 rating, the highest of the 
games, as Kristi Yamaguchi became the first American since Dorothy Hamill in 
1976 to win the gold medal. (That telecast also included coverage of the U.S. 
hockey loss to players from the former Soviet Union.) 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the popularity of figure skating was also illustrated by the fact 
that the only night of the 16 that CBS did not win the prime-time ratings race 
during the Games came on one it did not have any figure skating to show.

SPIELBERG MAKES THE DGA LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fresh off his multiple Golden Globe wins for "Schindler's List," Steven 
Spielberg on Monday found himself nominated for the prestigious Directors Guild 
of America award in the company of Jane Campion for "The Piano," Andrew Davis 
for "The Fugitive," James Ivory for "The Remains of the Day" and Martin 
Scorsese for "The Age of Innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 The five directors are the same group nominated for the Hollywood Foreign 
Press Assn.'s Golden Globes, which were awarded on Saturday. Spielberg picked 
up an award for best director and his movie about the Holocaust was also 
awarded best dramatic film and best screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Directors Guild and the Foreign Press overlooked Jonathan Demme, the 
winner of the Oscar and Directors Guild prizes for "The Silence of the Lambs," 
whose AIDS drama "Philadelphia" is one of the high-profile year-end Oscar 
hopefuls. The film has drawn mixed reactions from the critics, while receiving 
high praise for co-stars Tom Hanks, who won the Globe's best actor in a drama 
award this weekend, and Denzel Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 If history is any indication, the Directors Guild nominees will likely be the 
same individuals nominated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
for the Oscar. The Oscar nominations will be announced Feb. 9; Directors Guild 
prizes will be awarded March 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three times since 1949 has the winner of the Directors Guild failed to 
also take home the Oscar. And more often than not, the Academy voters also give 
the Oscar for best picture to their best director winner. For Spielberg, an 
Oscar win would be his first. 
</P>
<P>
 Campion, a New Zealander, is a first-time nominee and only the fourth woman 
ever nominated by the guild (before her: Lina Wertmuller in 1976, Randa Haines, 
1986, and Barbra Streisand, 1991). Campion's film, "The Piano," which stars 
Holly Hunter and is the story of a Scottish woman finding love outside of an 
arranged marriage in 19th-Century New Zealand, has been widely praised by 
critics groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, another first-time guild nominee, was named for "The Fugitive," which 
was based on the 1960s television series and starred Harrison Ford. "The 
Fugitive" was 1993's second-highest-grossing movie, collecting $180 million at 
the box office, surpassed only by Spielberg's monster hit "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivory's "Remains of the Day" is another pairing of Emma Thompson and Anthony 
Hopkins and it follows his 1992 Directors Guild and Oscar nomination for 
"Howards End," which also starred the duo. Ivory also was nominated by the 
guild in 1986 for "A Room With a View." 
</P>
<P>
 Scorsese received his fourth guild nomination for his opulently styled "The 
Age of Innocence." Although a popular and widely praised director, Scorsese has 
never won a guild award or Oscar, despite such contenders as "Taxi Driver," 
"GoodFellas" and "Raging Bull." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg's guild nomination for "Schindler's List" is his seventh time at 
bat. His one guild win came in 1985 for "The Color Purple," but he was 
overlooked in the Oscar race -- one of the three years when the guild winner 
did not go on to win the Oscar. Sydney Pollack won the Oscar that year for "Out 
of Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 With seven Directors Guild nominations, Spielberg is now in the company of 
John Huston, Elia Kazan, Sidney Lumet and William Wyler. Only Alfred Hitchcock, 
Billy Wilder and Fred Zinnemann received eight nominations. Spielberg's other 
nominations for the guild prize were for "Jaws," "Close Encounters of the Third 
Kind," "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "E.T.," and "Empire of the Sun."

<P>
 A pair of local producers say they will stage Stephen Sondheim's "A Little 
Night Music" in March at the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove, possibly as a prelude 
to mounting an eventual season there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're renting the theater for this first show, and we're raising the money 
ourselves," Beth Hansen said."We're also in negotiations with the Gem for a 
1994-95 season. If all this works out, we would be an independent company in 
residence there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen would star as Desiree in the musical. She is a partner with George 
Quick, who would direct, in a small production company called Actors' Cabaret 
Ensemble. "A Little Night Music" would run March 25-April 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking to raise between $35,000 and $50,000 for the show," Hansen 
said. Phone calls to the Gem went unanswered Monday. The theater has been 
largely inoperative since the collapse of its managing company, 
GroveShakespeare, in June, 1993.

QUAKE DIDN'T KEEP 'EM AWAY OVER WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Although quake-shattered nerves undoubtedly kept some patrons away from local 
arts and entertainment venues late last week, it was virtually business as 
usual at live performances over the weekend. However, movie attendance was down 
substantially because many movie theaters were closed. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard," which was not 
performed last Tuesday while damage to Century City's Shubert Theatre was 
assessed, said there were about 100 no-shows for Wednesday's and Thursday's 
previously sold-out performances, but that the Friday through Sunday the 
performances "were sold out -- period." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles Music Center reported more 
cancellations than usual since Wednesday night's gala opening of the opera "El 
Gato Montes," starring Placido Domingo. Spokesman Tom Jacobs said patrons have 
been calling in rather than simply not showing up, so that tickets have been 
resold. Although no figures were available, he said cancellations were highest 
for Wednesday's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ahmanson at the Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood resumed performances of 
"Fool Moon" Friday, after postponing Thursday's planned opening. Doolittle 
spokesman Tony Sherwood said that the 500-seat balcony has been closed pending 
cosmetic repairs but that balcony ticket holders are being relocated 
downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend performances at UCLA's Royce Hall were moved to the Wadsworth Theater 
because of structural damage. Friday's Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra 
performance, which drew 800 patrons to the 1450-seat theater, started 30 
minutes late to allow patrons time to make the switch. Saturday night's 
performance by the King's Singers drew a crowd of 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the large movie theater complexes in Los Angeles County, particularly 
those in the San Fernando Valley, remained closed for most of the weekend. One 
source estimated that the closures caused a 40% drop in business from a typical 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 John Krier, of the box-office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations Co., said any 
estimate of how many theaters were closed and of how much was lost would be 
difficult to measure. But, he added, "whatever the loss was, there was 
substantial drop-off in overall business." 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, business was reported off 25% for Brazilian 
singer-songwriter Dori Caymmi at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks, but off only slightly 
at the Palomino in North Hollywood for the Blazers on Friday and Dread Zeppelin 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds for Pharoah Sanders at Catalina's in Hollywood were described as 
"excellent." The Alligator Lounge in Santa Monica reported business as 
"average" on Friday and Saturday and "very good" on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood's most popular comedy clubs experienced a busy weekend after a 
post-quake week of light business; Budd Friedman's Improv had overflow crowds 
at both Friday and Saturday shows, but many clubs in the Valley were closed 
because of quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners and managers of home-video stores reported that business was up 
moderately over the weekend. The biggest increase in business seemed to be from 
areas hardest hit by the earthquake. The manager of the Wherehouse in Encino 
said she received a lot of weekend business from customers of the chain's store 
in Northridge, which was closed because of damage.

L.A. OPERA'S 'ROSENKAVALIER' TAKES A DIFFERENT DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Financial pressures have caused the L.A. Opera to cancel announced plans to 
present a new Gotz Friedrich/Berlin staging of "Der Rosenkavalier" in May and 
June of this year and, instead, to co-produce the same Richard Strauss opera 
with three other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friedrich production -- with designs by Robert Israel and Jan Skalicki -- 
will be replaced by a version that originates next month at the English 
National Opera in London, staged by British director Jonathan Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 As a reported consequence of the change, soprano Karan Armstrong (Friedrich's 
wife) has withdrawn from the Music Center performances and will be replaced in 
the role of the Marschallin by Ashley Putnam, who sang it with San Diego Opera 
in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 With sets and costumes by (respectively) Peter J. Davison and Sue Blane, 
Miller's ENO "Rosenkavalier" moves the action of the opera from the 18th 
Century to about 1910, the year of its composition. In London, it will be sung 
in English. 
</P>
<P>
 David Ritch will restage Miller's production locally -- using the original 
German libretto, and with a different cast than the ENO -- for six performances 
at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion from May 29 to June 12. Also sharing costs and 
eventual use of the production: New York City Opera and Houston Grand Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Opera General Manager Peter Hemmings explained Thursday that he 
reconsidered his plans to co-produce Friedrich's "Rosenkavalier" staging with 
the Deutsche Oper, Berlin, when he saw the production and found it "in our 
view, not appropriate for Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was extremely modernized," he said, "and as I said to him (Friedrich), one 
needed a knowledge of the social and artistic history of Europe to appreciate 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemmings said that he then discussed with the renowned German opera director 
the idea of creating "a new production more in line with what we needed, and I 
looked for a partner to enable us to afford it." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, the estimates we got for doing this (proposed) production, even 
with a partner, defeated us in a year when all arts organizations in the 
country are facing financial difficulties. I thought that it was inappropriate 
and, indeed, impossible for us to spend this sort of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemmings declined to be specific about the amount involved, saying only that 
"it was substantially more than we had in our budget for a co-production with 
Berlin. . . . In the past, when money was more available, you could sometimes 
risk something like this, but nowadays you can't." Contracts with Friedrich and 
Armstrong have been "mutually settled," he said, again not providing details. 
</P>
<P>
 In other L.A. Opera news, Paula Rasmussen replaces Stephanie Vlahos as Suzuki 
in the upcoming (Feb. 23 to March 8) Pavilion performances of "Madama 
Butterfly."

NEWS ANALYSIS; EL TORO PANEL POISED TO TAKE ON REUSE ISSUE; POLITICS: ALL SIDES 
DIDN'T ARRIVE AT TABLE AS EQUALS, BUT MEMBERS TOGETHER MUST FACE CRITICS WHO 
FEEL BOARD'S MAKEUP IS BIASED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With a great deal of trepidation and no guarantee of success, nine local 
politicians on Wednesday will take their seats at a table to begin deciding the 
post-military use of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the past holds lessons about the future -- jockeying over who should 
sit at the table kept the matter mired in controversy for six months -- then no 
one should expect either quick or easy solutions to the largest land-use issue 
facing Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 So tedious and contentious is the process expected to be that there is not 
even agreement yet among the board members on who should be allowed to occupy 
the posts of chairman and vice chairman of the new El Toro Reuse Planning 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The county wants its two South County supervisors to be in charge throughout 
the life of the agency, but Irvine, which has land-use authority over a small 
portion of the base, wants city officials to share the leadership positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the bigger task that the panel faces, the question of who will call the 
meetings to order may be the least of its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 With the county generally split over whether a commercial airport should be 
developed at the 4,700-acre site, the agency board -- including the five county 
supervisors, three Irvine council members and one Lake Forest council member -- 
may find its decisions constantly challenged by critics who feel the makeup of 
the panel is biased against an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 North County cities favoring a commercial airport at El Toro were left out of 
the decision-making process and are now trying to decide what their attitude 
and action plan should be. They could decide to "watchdog" the work of the 
agency by serving on subordinate advisory committees, or may decide to submit a 
competing redevelopment plan to the Defense Department, which makes the final 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 A pro-airport coalition of business and community groups is still weighing a 
proposal to circulate petitions to place the El Toro issue on the November 
ballot. While it may not be legally possible to require through a ballot 
measure that El Toro become an airport, the petition gatherers could ask for 
another planning agency that could undo the work of the group starting work on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the board members are looking over their shoulders at their critics, 
they are not letting it show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are going to do such a good job that I think everybody will be 
happy," predicted Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who is 
expected to be the El Toro agency's first chairman. "If I didn't think we could 
be successful, I guess I would not have voted for the plan" establishing the El 
Toro agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose district borders the base, said: "Being an 
optimist, I like to be a forward-looking person. . . . I think we need to move 
forward and focus on that and recognize that diversity of opinion is one of the 
strengths in our society." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine and Lake Forest officials publicly voice confidence in the work about 
to be undertaken, even though all sides did not arrive at the table as equal 
partners, and some resentment remains over the leadership issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has proposed that Riley, whose 5th District includes the base, be 
chairman and that Vasquez, the 3rd District supervisor, serve as vice chairman. 
In succeeding years, the leadership positions would shift back and forth 
between the supervisors from those two districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the county has land-use authority over all but 300 acres of the base, 
county officials argue, the supervisors have a right to the two positions.  
</P>
<P>
 But Irvine wants the county and one of the two member cities to share the 
leadership positions at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it sends a bad signal, and I think the county would readily agree it 
sends a bad signal to a lot of people" if the county insists on reserving for 
itself the two top positions, said Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond. By 
refusing to share these leadership posts, Hammond said, the county is 
essentially saying "that they are the only show in town." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the ultimate resolution is on that, so I would rather not 
comment on that," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the five supervisors make up a majority of the nine-member board 
and could easily vote to keep those titles. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that voting bloc that worries Lake Forest Councilwoman Ann Van Haun, who 
wants written assurances that no vote can be taken without a member from each 
agency being present. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities left off the decision-making board will be invited to serve on a 
50-member advisory panel that will pick the top three redevelopment options. 
The "executive council" will include the county, all 31 cities and 
representatives of seven unincorporated areas of South County, seven business 
groups and four universities. 
</P>
<P>
 While the North County cities may participate on the council, some are 
considering developing a competing base conversion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would advocate an alternative plan. In order to be a watchdog, you have to 
have something other than to just sit there and be a watchdog," Newport Beach 
Mayor Clarence J. Turner said. "The future of the county is so dependent on 
that base for an economic shot in the arm that the rest of us have really got 
to fight for our rights. It's no longer a matter of noise, it's a matter of 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if there is no further controversy, the planning will take a long time. 
Consultants must be hired and all of the buildings on the base must be 
inventoried to determine their condition and future use.

ANCIENT BONES STIR CONTROVERSY; WETLANDS: FOES OF BUILDING AT BOLSA CHICA 
ACCUSE DEVELOPMENT FIRM, ARCHEOLOGIST OF FAILING TO MENTION FINDINGS OF HUMAN 
REMAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of developing the Bolsa Chica wetlands charged Monday that the Koll 
Real Estate Group and its private archeologist withheld information about the 
discovery of 8,000-year-old human bones at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 A Koll official and the archeologist denied the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of long bone shafts and cranial fragments were disclosed by Judy 
Myers Suchey, a forensic anthropologist and Cal State Fullerton instructor. She 
examined the fragments at an excavation site and at the laboratory of 
Scientific Resource Surveys Inc., a private archeological firm hired by Koll. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report, Suchey wrote: "The skeletal remains coming from this site are 
very old, approximately 8,000 years old as indicated from some current dating 
procedures . . . the bone comes from a uniform layer, the upper part of the 
Pleistocene terrace deposit. For this reason, the bone is clearly prehistoric 
and cannot be confused with modern skeletal material of forensic interest to 
the Coroner." 
</P>
<P>
 Suchey was hired by the Orange County coroner's office to investigate the 
fragments after Nancy Desautels, an archeologist and owner of Scientific 
Resource, told the coroner that human bones had been found during an 
excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 What has angered environmentalists is that no mention of the bones, their age 
or possible archeological significance was made to county planners and thus did 
not appear in the county's recently released draft of an environmental impact 
report on the Koll development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's alarming, to say the least, that the EIR released by the county 
says that no human bones have been reported on the Bolsa Chica Mesa," said 
Flossie Horgan, president of the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, the main opponent of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact," Horgan said, "in the EIR, they gave the right designation for the 
particular site, but under the column of any human remains, it said, 'None 
reported.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Koll proposes to build 4,286 homes on 400 acres of the site in exchange for 
the company spending $48 million to restore 1,100 acres of wetlands. Project 
foes argue that the wetlands should remain undeveloped, especially now that the 
area may have archeological importance. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Horgan's criticism, Lucy Dunn, Koll's senior vice president, 
said Monday that she had not seen Suchey's letter, but she denied that the Koll 
company or Desautels hid information about the bones after they were unearthed 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dunn: "The Land Trust group is really making much ado about material that 
is still under scientific review." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Dunn said that publicizing the finding might jeopardize the 
integrity of the dig by enticing souvenir seekers to the site. Guards have been 
hired as security at the site, whose location the company did not disclose. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Matthews, director of planning for the county's Environmental Management 
Agency, said Monday that he was not aware of the information in Suchey's 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will look into that and I will ask our technical staff who prepared the 
environmental studies to address that," Matthews said. "But (the Land Trust's) 
comments should have been made to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews and the county recently were criticized for refusing to hold public 
hearings on the draft environmental impact report. However, interested parties 
still have until Feb. 18 to submit written comments about the report. 
</P>
<P>
 After the report is revised and completed, Matthews said, the county will hold 
a series of public hearings on the project in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently we have a group or groups that are questioning the draft's 
veracity and we would be happy to address that and answer their questions," 
Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 Desautels, the private archeologist hired by Koll, said she did not inform the 
county planning agency about the human bone fragments because she had not 
finished her own analysis and report. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you find bone it's very fragmented, heavily mineralized and really 
difficult to know what you're dealing with," Desautels said. "Now we do have 
human bone fragments mixed in with animal bone. But due to the nature, it's 
very difficult to determine what you have." 
</P>
<P>
 Desautels and David Kice, a human osteologist working with Desautels, have 
been finding small shells and other deposits dating back 6,000 to 7,000 years 
at a 30-foot-square site on the wetlands. Up to now, bone fragments have been 
only from small animals, Desautels said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Patricia Martz, a member of the State Historical Resources 
Commission and professor of anthropology at Cal State University at Los 
Angeles, the finding of human skeletal remains is potentially significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to scientific value, they have value to Native Americans," Martz 
said. "The value of a prehistoric site increases if they have a cemetery 
involved. And, the fact that some human remains were found would suggest that 
perhaps more are scattered around the area."

'EXEMPLARY' TEEN DIES OF CANCER; OBITUARY: BRICE DICKERSON INSPIRED MANY FOR 
EARNING FOUNTAIN VALLEY HIGH DIPLOMA DESPITE HIS ILLNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Brice Dickerson, whose quest for a high school diploma in the face of terminal 
brain cancer won the hearts of students and teachers at Fountain Valley High 
School, died Sunday. He was 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickerson died at home here after a nine-year battle with medulloblastoma, a 
form of brain cancer.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was an exemplary young man," said Tom Antal, assistant principal at 
Fountain Valley High. "He was very much a model to a lot of kids. . . . He 
earned a diploma under conditions that many others would have given up." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, flags at Fountain Valley High School flew at half staff. An 
announcement of Dickerson's death was made over the school's public address 
system and a tribute to the young man was given by a school dean. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was definitely a sadness around campus today," Antal said. "There was a 
sense that this was a very significant event." 
</P>
<P>
 Dickerson became an inspiration to many students and teachers at the school, 
not only because he was determined to earn a diploma in spite his illness, but 
also because he remained optimistic even though the cancer ravaged his body. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time of his death, Dickerson had become a quadriplegic. But even that 
condition didn't dampen his spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fought to the very end," said Ellen Saenz, a teacher who worked with him 
for the past four years. "Brice just had a wonderful soul." 
</P>
<P>
 When Dickerson was first diagnosed at age 9, he was given only six months to 
live. He was determined, however, to beat the odds and was always willing to 
undergo experimental medical treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brice never had that attitude that he was going to give up," said his father, 
Mike Dickerson. "Never." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Dickerson used his situation to help others. Occasionally, he gave 
inspirational speeches to medical or business groups, telling them about his 
long ordeal with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 But he didn't like to dwell on his condition either, friends said. He 
preferred to ask others how they were feeling. His father said the happiest 
time of his son's life was last July when he went on a two-week church mission 
in a poor section of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those two weeks, he said he never thought of his cancer," Mike Dickerson 
said. "Material things didn't mean anything to him after that. He was so 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Saenz: "He was always concerned about others."  
</P>
<P>
 And others were concerned about him. 
</P>
<P>
 Several student groups at Fountain Valley High held fund-raisers to help the 
Dickersons with Brice's medical bills. The mayor of Williamsport, Pa., where 
the Little League World Series are held, gave him a key to the city after 
learning that the teen-ager had always wanted to participate in the event. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to baseball, Dickerson was interested in football and had a dream 
of his realized when he attended the 1986 Rose Bowl. After the game, UCLA coach 
Terry Donahue awarded him the game ball. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was at school where Dickerson found much of his pleasure in life. He 
enjoyed the social aspect to it and even attended the homecoming dance last 
October. Two months ago, high school officials, sensing that Dickerson would 
soon succumb to his illness, held a special graduation ceremony for him, 
complete with a chorus and speeches. More than 700 people attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here was a student who touched so many people," said Saenz, who added that 
the mortuary was so moved that it donated the funeral costs to his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickerson is survived by his parents, Mike and Cindy Dickerson, and three 
brothers, Shawn, 20, Brandon, 15, and Ryan, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 A viewing will be held Wednesday between 4 and 8 p.m. at Pacific View Memorial 
Park, 3500 Pacific View Drive in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services are scheduled for Thursday at 2 p.m. at the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints at 8702 Atlanta Ave. in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions be sent to the Brice 
Dickerson Memorial Fund at Fountain Valley High School, 17816 Bushard St., 
Fountain Valley, Calif. 92708, in care of Ellen Saenz.

PARKS HAVE WORN OUT THE WELCOME; RECREATION: ONCE SEEN AS NEIGHBORHOOD ASSETS, 
THEY ARE NOW VIEWED BY SOME IN DANA POINT AS HAVENS FOR CRIME AND VIOLENCE.

 Shouts and catcalls interrupted the speakers, and as the crowd grew even 
angrier, Bob Wilberg became edgy. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point, I thought I should shut the meeting down, but I thought I might 
have a riot in the audience," recalled Wilberg, then-board president of the 
Capistrano Bay Park and Recreation District. 
</P>
<P>
 The heated debate last month did not center on a proposed jail, city dump or 
anything flagrantly ominous. No, these days in Dana Point, residents are 
haranguing elected officials that they don't want city parks and soccer fields 
-- the very amenities most other cities crave. 
</P>
<P>
 Five sites are slated for parks, and plans to develop the first two parks have 
drawn outcries that the recreational areas will destroy neighborhoods by 
bringing in traffic, congestion, noise and -- as residents stated at the 
meeting -- "outsiders" and "undesirables" in their "low-riding cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the protests have touched a nerve. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Olvera, a city planning commissioner, said: "Although many people 
express themselves in a politically correct manner, there's a certain undertone 
that appears to be racial discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 Although residents flatly deny that is behind their objections, one thing is 
clear: 
</P>
<P>
 "Parks are not the warm fuzzies they used to be," said City Councilman Mike 
Eggers. "The perception now is that they attract crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Although an October, 1993, consultant's study shows that Dana Point has only 
three acres of parkland for each 1,000 residents -- a lower ratio than most 
neighboring cities -- many homeowners have a different idea what to do with the 
once precious land: Sell it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "All government is in a fiscal crisis now," said Bill Shepherd, president of 
the Lantern Village Assn., which is lobbying to stop a park in its crowded 
neighborhood. "I think this is a good opportunity for the city to step back and 
look at the bigger picture. . . . Maybe some of this land should be sold off." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more to this than fiscal worries. People say they're afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, highly publicized problems of late-night drug dealing and crime at 
Dana Point's small Shipwreck Park in the Lantern Village caused it to be closed 
at dusk. More frightening was the October incident at Calafia Beach County Park 
in San Clemente where a teen-ager died after a confrontation with another group 
of youths, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many of you want a paint roller in your child's head?" parent Chris Daiy 
asked the park board. "That's what happened over there in San Clemente. . . . I 
moved from that. I don't want that here." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he concedes there have been isolated problems, such anti-park and 
anti-soccer field sentiment amazes Lynn J. Muir, who remembers how it was only 
a few years ago, when the Capistrano Bay Parks and Recreation District 
aggressively scrounged for property within the six-square-mile city to turn 
into parks before it was lost to development. 
</P>
<P>
 The small, independent district was created in 1965 but was dissolved late 
last month after state budget problems left the district with little revenue. 
The city has now inherited the five park sites, which the now-defunct park 
district bought for $5 million, and will decide how to develop them. 
</P>
<P>
 When the old park district surveyed community residents only three years ago, 
"more parks were identified as the No. 1 priority," said Muir, who served on 
the district's board. 
</P>
<P>
 In what now seems like a distant past, parks were perceived as amenities that 
lured people to buy homes in local developments, knowing their children would 
have a place to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "People loved them. We never had a park nobody wanted," Muir said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was then. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is happening virtually everywhere, Olvera believes this community 
of 33,000 people has an especially strong case of wanting things, as long as 
they are in someone else's neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's NIMBY (not in my back yard), pure NIMBY," Olvera said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Olvera also hears hints of something more serious when some park foes use 
terms like "outsiders" and "undesirables." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very upset about it, very concerned," said Olvera, the U.S.-born son of a 
Mexican immigrant. "From my viewpoint, it's a Catch 22. We want to give the 
kids something to do, so they are not sitting around with time on their hands, 
but people don't want them in their area." 
</P>
<P>
 At the tumultuous Dec. 7 park board meeting, the subject that raised the 
residents' ire was a proposed soccer field at a three-acre parcel next to their 
homes and San Juan Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 But peppered into the discussion of problems with lights, traffic and parking 
was a more chilling discussion about the field maybe attracting gangs to cruise 
into the neighborhood and threaten local children. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Lockwood-Larson, a six-year resident of the Marlborough Seaside tract 
near the three-acre parcel, acknowledged the sometimes nasty tone of the 
meeting, which she attended, but chalked it up to the heat of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very strongly my neighbors are not racists," Lockwood-Larson said. 
"People are concerned about bad elements, but I think we need to be supportive 
of our cultural diversity and all work together." 
</P>
<P>
 Another park controversy has arisen in the crowded cluster of apartments and 
duplexes called the Lantern Village, just behind Dana Point's downtown, where a 
community center and park have been proposed for a small parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepherd and others in the community association are convinced a park of any 
sort there will only add to the area's crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to see open space, not a park that is difficult to control," 
said Shepherd, 46, who lives a block and a half from the proposed park. "The 
solution here is to make the community a cleaner, safer place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 With the old park district gone, now the decisions on what to do with the park 
sites fall to the city. City Manager Stephen B. Julian said he understands the 
difficulty, and the protests, he has inherited.  
</P>
<P>
 The city needs parks and ball fields, but determining what kinds of parks and 
where to locate them will not be an easy task, Julian said. People in the 
community don't want city dollars spent on parks that simply become "a hangout 
spot for folks with nothing better to do but drink and carouse," Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people have a good reason to be concerned about problems in parks, 
but we still have to provide recreational facilities for our residents," Julian 
said. Saying No to Parks 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Point is more densely populated than surrounding cities but various 
measures of park and open space do not differ greatly:

 Irvine Valley College's annual invention fair over the weekend drew more than 
750 people, who examined the creations of local elementary and junior high 
school students. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 students from Irvine and Tustin schools on Saturday displayed their 
often unusual inventions, which ranged from a toothbrush for people with braces 
to a bike-riding visor. 
</P>
<P>
 Allyson Pizula, a fourth-grader at Santiago Hills Elementary School in Irvine, 
won the grand prize for the most practical invention: a locking holder for a 
helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Bodylski, a student at Loma Vista Elementary School in Santa Ana, won a 
prize in the first- and second-grade category for his solar-powered food and 
drink cooler. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Rossiter, a student at Brywood Elementary School in Irvine, won a prize 
in the fifth-grade category for his see-through toaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those who attended the fair also took part in an invention contest in 
which they were given a bag of common household items and asked to transform 
them into something useful. 
</P>
<P>
 One inventor attached two inflated balloons to a paper plate to create an 
"earthquake air bag." The device protects fragile valuables that are placed 
between the two balloons. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; WIPING OUT THE WRITING ON THE WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's sprawling 310-mile network of flood control channels were 
built to handle rising waters from storms, but in recent years, they have met a 
different sort of deluge: graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Although two county paint crews work full time removing graffiti, in addition 
to court-ordered work hours, volunteers are needed to turn back the tide of 
tagging. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an important step toward reclaiming our community from these vandals," 
said Chaz Ferguson, county graffiti abatement coordinator. "And the people who 
volunteer get a great deal of satisfaction from the work. They get a feeling 
they are making a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors in August approved a package of anti-graffiti 
tactics, among them the creation of the volunteer program. Since then, half a 
dozen groups, ranging from a homeowners' association to a Girl Scout troop, 
have helped repaint the channels. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of February, the total wall area covered by county crews and 
volunteer groups combined will probably top half a million square feet, 
Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But graffiti vandalism, which reached a fever pitch in late 1992 and early 
1993, has dipped in recent months, Ferguson said. He and other officials 
attributed that to stiffer penalties, stepped-up police efforts resulting in 
more arrests and the increasingly violent tendencies of taggers, which have 
scared away novice vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Only South County seems to be bucking the trend, with graffiti incidents on 
county property increasing in cities such as Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Lake 
Forest and Mission Viejo, reports show. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of agreements worked out with 15 cities, county workers patrolling the 
channels in those cities are allowed to paint over graffiti on adjacent public 
property, and even private property with owner consent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our attitude is, if we're there, let's go ahead and take care of it; let's 
get it down off the wall," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community volunteers are outfitted with paintbrushes and rollers, disposable 
orange safety vests and work gloves. A county employee, often accompanied by a 
court-ordered worker, ferries the volunteers and their five-gallon drums of 
paint through the channels in a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers are typically civic or community organizations, but school 
classes and corporate groups also participate. 
</P>
<P>
 To report graffiti on county property, call (714) 834-3400. To volunteer a 
group or get more information about the program, call Ferguson at (714) 
567-6280. GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; RESIDENTIAL HOTEL VOTE DUE TONIGHT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of debate, the City Council tonight is scheduled to decide the 
fate of a proposal to build a residential hotel next to an industrial area off 
Jamboree Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission last year rejected the plan, saying the hotel's 
proposed location near a rock-crushing plant and garbage facility was not 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 But others in the city continue to support the project, arguing that the hotel 
would provide an attractive living arrangement for people who work in Irvine 
but can't afford to live there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co., Shawnatana Development Corp. and HomeAid Orange County seek to 
jointly develop the three-story, $12-million Irvine Inn. The hotel would have 
265 rooms -- each complete with a bathroom and small kitchenette. A furnished 
room would cost about $370 a month, hundreds less than a one-bedroom apartment 
in most parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have expressed support for the Irvine Inn concept, but some 
said the proposed location is too isolated from shopping and lacks adequate 
public transportation. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TRAINS' IMPORTANCE IN QUAKE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County residents would need a variety of ways to commute in the event 
of an earthquake and would be especially reliant on Metrolink trains, the 
chairman of the county's top transportation agency said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake in Los Angeles County demonstrated the need to have a 
multi-mode transportation system, with elements that can fill the gap when 
major roads and arteries are out," Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, chairman of the 
Orange County Transportation Authority, told the OCTA board. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the supervisor singled out Metrolink, adding that the "earthquake brought 
Metrolink to the forefront," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA operates one commuter train daily on a round trip between Orange County 
and Los Angeles; although the train is painted with periwinkle and white 
Metrolink markings, technically Metrolink won't officially come to the county 
until March, when three additional trains will join the route. The existing 
service is run by Amtrak crews under contract to OCTA. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA board member Sarah Catz said she is confident that the additional trains 
will be available even though Los Angeles has borrowed rail cars to serve in 
the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said he and OCTA Chief Stan Oftelie will discuss the need for OCTA to 
maintain full service in the event of an earthquake similar to the one centered 
in Northridge a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said he has been reassured that the office building in Orange where 
OCTA is headquartered has been strengthened, and he intends to press his 
inquiry to be sure that OCTA's satellite facilities -- including bus yards and 
depots -- will also be serviceable after a significant quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance communications and planning are important, Vasquez said, because of an 
earthquake's "devastating economic and social impact." JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; YARD WASTE TO BE PICKED UP AT CURB

<P>
 The Midway City Sanitary District will begin curbside pickup of yard waste 
such as grass clippings and tree and brush trimmings under a six-month pilot 
program that will start next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Don Snavely said residents should put their waste in separate 
containers from their household trash to make it easier for work crews. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged residents to use trash bins for the green waste rather than plastic 
bags. The collected waste will be taken to a compost facility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the six-month trial period, the program will be evaluated to 
determine if it will be continued, Snavely said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will help the district comply with state recycling requirements," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitary district serves about 75,000 households -- about 85% of 
Westminster and the western portion of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; NEW VIDEO PRESERVES THE HISTORY OF A CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city Community Development Department has produced a video that provides a 
glimpse of the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-minute video features historic residences and buildings in the Old Town 
area and describes efforts being made to preserve them.It includes anecdotes, 
tales and interviews of longtime residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the video started in September, 1992, when the city received a $7,500 
grant from the state's Office of Historic Preservation. It was completed in 
November, 1993. The filming took nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Planner Dana Ogdon said the video is intended to be an educational and 
promotional tool to be presented at schools, libraries, historical societies 
and neighborhood organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogdon said the video is available for $5.65 at the Community Development 
Department at City Hall, 300 Centennial Way. Residents may also borrow the 
video, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A video company from Newport Beach, Videography, produced the video with the 
assistance of members of the city's Cultural Resources Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The interviews were conducted in March and April of longtime residents who 
reminisced about Tustin at the turn of the century and provided some anecdotes 
about Columbus Tustin, who founded the city in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the video is a collection of photographs of such historic 
structures as the Tustin Bank building and the old high school and hotel, which 
were demolished in the 1960s. There are also shots of a blacksmith shop, a 
ballet studio and Stevens Square, which were created in the early 1900s. BERT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; PARK RESIDENTS TO PREPARE AID REPORT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of mobile home park residents seeking assistance to purchase their 
park will give a detailed report of their needs to the city within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members expressed skepticism last week about guaranteeing a $6-million 
loan on behalf of residents at the Kimberly Gardens mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
 However, representatives of the tenants in the 159-space park maintained that 
they aren't looking for a handout. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't going to cost the city a red cent," said Jim Froelich, speaking 
for the Kimberly Gardens Mobile Home Owners Assn. "All we want is to get your 
support in acquiring the property." 
</P>
<P>
 Froelich said the tenants want the city to guarantee a private loan for the 
park and "act kind of like a father in co-signing the loan." 
</P>
<P>
 However, council members expressed reluctance to be responsible for a 
multimillion-dollar loan. "Let's be real," said Councilman Richard T. Dixon. 
"If you guys could qualify for a loan, you wouldn't be here. If you forfeit on 
the loan, the city would be forced to fork out the money" to pay it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Froelich admitted that "there is potential exposure" for the city in 
co-signing the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenants have also expressed an interest in purchasing the park, which city 
officials estimated would cost about $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Gardens is one of four mobile home parks in the city that are pushing 
for rent control, claiming that landlords have overcharged for rents in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 A rent moratorium failed on a 3-2 vote last month. Council members turned it 
down, saying that most of the approximately 1,200 mobile home dwellers in the 
city are currently on one- to five-year leases and wouldn't be affected by a 
rent moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The council asked tenants and landlords to continue their 18-month 
negotiations over space fees and rent rollbacks. FRANK MESSINA

<P>
 The future Bolsa Chica Wetlands Research and Education Center arrived by truck 
Monday at a parking lot of the ecological reserve and is waiting to be 
transformed into a science lab and visitors center to increase public 
appreciation of the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,440-square-foot, double-wide mobile home, purchased and outfitted 
through a $138,000 grant from the California Coastal Conservancy, is scheduled 
to open in a festival-like atmosphere in mid-April during the return of the 
California Least Tern from Mexico and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening also is expected to coincide with visits to the wetlands by third- 
and fourth-graders from throughout Orange County as part of the county 
Department of Education's environmental studies program. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will house a visitors center, a wetlands library and a laboratory 
for the Volunteer Scientists Program, which will study methods for future 
wetland restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Fish & Game Department and the Bolsa Chica Conservancy will 
have offices in the center. The Bolsa Chica Conservancy, which will operate the 
center, is a nonpolitical, nonprofit organization dedicated to wetlands 
education, research and restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Smith, the Bolsa Chica Conservancy's executive director, said there will 
be displays on wetlands, ecology, migratory birds, history and endangered 
species of the area that include the Belding Savannah sparrow, the light-footed 
clapper rail, the California brown pelican, the California least tern and the 
Peregrine falcon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real step forward," said City Councilman Victor Leipzig, who was on 
hand for the arrival of the mobile building at the parking lot on Warner 
Avenue, just east of Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a growing awareness of the wetlands but a new generation needs 
educating every year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Louann W. Murray, a wetlands scientist and research director for the local 
conservancy, said that more than 90% of the wetlands in California have been 
destroyed by development. The proposed restoration would be the largest in 
Southern California, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll Real Estate Group is seeking to build more than 4,000 homes in the 
area while restoring 1,100 acres of wetlands and open space. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is equipped with several security systems and shatter-proof 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand opening has been delayed until April so that displays of the Bolsa 
Chica wildlife and habitat can be completed. ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; CLERK GETS PETITIONS TO RECALL 2 ON COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recall petitions with more than 24,000 signatures seeking the ouster of City 
Council members Molly McClanahan and Don Bankhead were presented Monday to the 
city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 The two council members, along with Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin, are targeted by 
residents who are unhappy with the council's July, 1993, approval of a 2% 
utility users tax. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Deputy City Clerk Audrey Culver, a rough count showed 12,512 
signatures on the petitions against McClanahan and 12,541 on the Bankhead 
petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents need 8,329 signatures from registered voters -- 15% of all voters 
-- to require the city to set a recall election, which could be held as soon as 
June 7. It would be the first recall election in city history. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver on Monday took the signatures to the county registrar of voters, where 
they will be checked at a cost of $1.03 per signature. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the campaigns against the mayor and council members, residents 
are circulating petitions to remove City Clerk Anne M. York because she had 
rejected some recall petitions that were longer than the law allows. 
</P>
<P>
 W. Snow Hume, secretary of the Fullerton Recalls Committee, said his group is 
"confident that we will get the required number" of valid signatures. He 
pointed out that recall campaigns in other cities have seen from 10% to 30% of 
their signatures invalidated, and his group can afford to have up to a third of 
its signatures disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Recalls Committee has until next Monday to present petitions to 
remove Catlin and York. The committee recently announced that it has more than 
11,000 signatures against each of these officials. 
</P>
<P>
 McClanahan said Monday that she is upset by the campaign against her but will 
fight to remain in office. "I guess I feel that this is out of character for 
Fullerton," she said. Her term ends in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead, whose term ends in November, 1996, said he also will campaign to 
stay in office. He said he is confident he made the right decision to vote for 
the utility tax. Bankhead said he was concerned that the city would have to 
make drastic cuts in the Police and Fire Department budgets, which were 
shielded from much of the cutting demanded of other departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall proponents argued in July that the council should have placed the issue 
on a special ballot, so city voters could voice their opinion. The vote would 
only have been advisory, since voters cannot legally impose a tax; only the 
council can. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin said there was no need for an advisory ballot, adding that he supported 
the tax after studying the city's economic situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to make tough decisions," Catlin said recently. "If you have to go 
to the voters all the time to get their input, then you shouldn't be in 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 The tax is expected to raise about $1.6 million this fiscal year. The city 
general fund budget is about $45 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin said he had not planned to run for reelection after his term expires in 
November. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; EATERY SEEKS TO ADD PATIO AT END OF PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ruby's is seeking to add a patio seating area to its restaurant at the end of 
the Seal Beach Pier, but there's concern the project could limit space for 
public fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has postponed a decision on the proposal until Feb. 9 
so that city officials can gather additional information about the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruby's wants to use 780 square feet of the pier to build a patio dining area 
that can seat about 55 people. The restaurant chain would rent the land from 
the city, which owns the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission last week requested that the city examine how the expansion 
would affect people who fish off the pier. The project "basically takes away a 
portion of the pier from those who walk on it and restricts it to customers of 
the restaurant," said Planning Director Lee Whittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials plan to contact the Department of Fish and Game to get its 
opinion on the issue. In addition to city approval, Ruby's must also get 
permission from the California Coastal Commission before building the patio. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruby's shares the end of the pier with a bait shop and charter fishing 
business. The prime location offers ocean views from inside the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittenberg said the expansion would be the largest new development on the 
pier in several years. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA; WOUND CARE CENTER TO HOLD OPEN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the La Palma Wound Care Center officially opened earlier this month, it 
became the second such medical facility in the county and one of 50 nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wound Care Center specializes in the treatment of slow-healing 
wounds.Nearly 6 million people nationwide suffer from chronic, non-healing 
wounds caused primarily by poor blood circulation, diabetes or long-term 
immobilization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wound Care Center will hold an open house Wednesday from 2 to 5 p.m. The 
outpatient center will offer a brief tour and free foot, blood sugar and blood 
pressure screenings. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-healing wounds are usually on the lower parts of the legs and on the 
bottom of the feet, say center officials. More than half of amputations are the 
result of complications arising from non-healing wounds, officials add. 
</P>
<P>
 At the facility, patients receive care from a medical team, which includes the 
patient's referring physician, surgeons, podiatrists, endocrinologists and 
nurses -- all of whom are specially trained in healing wounds. The center also 
instructs patients on how to care for their wounds at home, providing 
information about diet, hygiene and exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to open the center was about $220,000, officials say. The center, at 
a medical office building at 5471 La Palma Ave., began treating patients 
earlier this month. For more information, call (714) 994-2241. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; SKI-A-THON PLANNED IN BROTHER'S MEMORY 
</P>

<P>
 It was an annual trip they had made since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Shellie Woods and her brother, Steve, would head to Mammoth Mountain each 
February for a weekend of skiing in celebration of their birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really important that we'd always put that together," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since her brother's slaying last fall in San Clemente, Woods said, it is more 
important than ever to continue the tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 So she is seeking volunteers and sponsors for ski-a-thon set for Feb. 26 at 
Mammoth Mountain in memory of her 17-year-old brother. Proceeds from the event 
will go to local gang-prevention programs and bring attention to the Oct. 15 
crime that resulted in her brother's death and shocked the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school senior was fatally injured when someone plunged a paint roller 
rod through his head as he and a group of friends were trying to drive from a 
confrontation at Calafia County Beach Park. Six people, all alleged members or 
associates of a San Clemente gang, were charged in connection with the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to send the word about what happened," Woods said. "Instead of it 
being 'Save San Clemente,' let's save California." 
</P>
<P>
 For information on how to help with the event, contact Woods at (714) 
443-9482. ANNA CEKOLA

COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT CALLS FOR COPTERS; PUBLIC SAFETY: REPORT ON EMERGENCY 
PREPAREDNESS URGES SUPERVISORS TO SUPPORT $500,000 IN REPAIRS TO MAKE TWO 
MILITARY-SURPLUS CRAFT AIRWORTHY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An Orange County helicopter program, grounded during the Laguna Beach 
firestorms, is being recommended for takeoff, according to a county Fire 
Department review of local emergency preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was completed after last week's catastrophic Northridge earthquake 
but provides few details about cost and operation of a firefighting air force. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the proposal is expected to get general support today when it is 
presented to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28-page report also called on officials to strengthen a network of county 
fire stations long at risk of future earthquake damage, and to pay a consultant 
to review the county emergency plan. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the list, however, fire officials asked for aerial support to 
aid in rescue, firefighting and transportation operations in isolated areas of 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "This last week has provided living examples of how helicopters could increase 
our efficiency in times of emergency," board Chairman Thomas F. Riley said. 
"We'll see what miracles we can work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Only last month, fire officials complained that much of the $435 million in 
damages at Laguna Beach could have been averted had the two county-owned 
helicopters been operational during the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "The need for the helicopters stands on its own," county Fire Chief Larry 
Holms said Monday. "But the earthquake just increases the value of having 
helicopters available." 
</P>
<P>
 Holms declined to discuss details of the Fire Department's plan, but county 
officials have estimated that it could cost up to $500,000 to refurbish the two 
helicopters and at least a year to place them in service. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Vietnam War-era helicopters were provided to the county four years ago 
as part of a military-surplus program, but budget problems have prevented their 
conversion to firefighting aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials have said the choppers could have played a key role in ferrying 
water to remote areas on Oct. 27 just as flames began to spread and ground 
crews had exhausted their water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "In looking at what happened in Los Angeles last week," Holms said, 
"Helicopters were used to fight fires in areas cut off (to ground units). They 
would be beneficial here in a similar type of event." 
</P>
<P>
 The report on the county's overall preparedness was ordered last week when 
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said she was "embarrassed" that the county had 
not set deadlines to complete renovations to 14 firehouses deemed to be at 
"high" or "very high" risk of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 County documents had shown renovation plans for only two of the stations. Six 
stations were in the process of relocation, and four were city-owned with 
remodeling responsibilities falling to those cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report to be considered by the board today, Wieder said she was 
satisfied with fire officials' call to proceed with remodeling work and 
"incorporate progressive seismic design strategies" in new and remodeled 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of helicopters, Wieder said she supported the "concept" but 
"school is not out on whether it is cost-effective." 
</P>
<P>
 "This earthquake was a wake-up call for all of us," Wieder said. "It's 
something that we tend not to think about on sunny days. I want to make sure 
that our planning doesn't fall through the cracks."

MALL BOMB SCARE MAY BE LINKED TO BANK ROBBERY; CRIME: AS A FAKE INCENDIARY 
DEVICE WAS BEING REMOVED FROM A NEWS RACK IN LAGUNA HILLS, A HOLDUP WAS TAKING 
PLACE HALF A MILE AWAY.

<P>
 A shopping plaza was evacuated during a one-hour bomb scare Monday that Orange 
County sheriff's investigators believe may have been a diversion for a nearby 
bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sheriff's bomb squad was removing a fake incendiary device from a Los 
Angeles Times news rack at about 11:30 a.m., two men were robbing a Bank of 
America about half a mile away from the shopping center at El Toro Road and 
Moulton Parkway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at the possibility they could be linked," said Sheriff's Lt. 
Dan Martini. "It's a logical avenue to investigate." 
</P>
<P>
 An FBI spokesman said that two men threatened bank customers, brandishing 
pistols and waving what appeared to be a hand grenade before they escaped with 
an undisclosed amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a takeover," said FBI special agent Gary Morley. "One of them had come 
in and talked to (a bank employee) about a home loan. As soon as the second guy 
came in, they pulled out their guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "One also yelled out that he had a bomb and produced what looked to be a hand 
grenade." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries, Morley said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1978 Oldsmobile believed to be the getaway car was found a short distance 
away in a residential neighborhood at Verdugo and Alcalde drives. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI investigators are "aware of the bomb scare and we're looking into it to 
see if (the incidents) are related," Morley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first suspect is described as in his 30s, 5 feet, 10 inches tall and 
weighing about 180 pounds. The second man is about six feet tall, with a thin 
build, a beard and gray hair. Both are black, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bogus bomb was discovered in a news rack outside a Vons grocery store. The 
bomb squad found two road flares, a 9-volt battery and a stopwatch wrapped in 
black tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like a couple of sticks of dynamite," said Ella James, who walked 
past the grocery store shortly after the device was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The supermarket and several stores on each side of the market were evacuated 
and closed for about an hour.

STORM BRINGS WARNING ABOUT MUDSLIDES IN BURNED AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fire-ravaged areas of South County were bracing Monday night for a fast-moving 
storm system that brought rain throughout the county just after 7:30 p.m., four 
hours after the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The service also issued an urban and small stream flood advisory for the 
Laguna Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the rain began, police in Costa Mesa had to block off the 
intersection of 19th Street and Anaheim Avenue, a usual flooding location. 
Several minor collisions occurred at Westminster intersections, which police 
attributed to rain-slick roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're expecting a quarter of an inch to half an inch in the coastal areas" 
through this morning, with decreasing clouds through the afternoon, said Curtis 
A. Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData, which provides forecasts for the 
Times. The rain was expected to stop this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "These showers are associated with a strong but fast-moving upper-level 
disturbance which will move over the forecast area tonight," according to a 
National Weather Service statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The California Office of Emergency Services, in cooperation with the National 
Weather Service, advises that an inch or more of rain in a six-hour period may 
cause mud and debris flows in recently burned areas," the statement said. 
"Large areas of loose, unstable ash and topsoil may wash or flow during heavy 
rainfall."

GUNMAN SLAIN IN FOILED ROBBERY OF ARMORED TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gunmen dressed as women tried to rob an armored truck courier in front of a 
supermarket here Monday, and during a shoot-out one robber was killed and the 
courier was critically wounded, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two robbers escaped and were still at large, Corona police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the attackers appeared to be men dressed in women's clothing, 
Cpl. John Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 The courier, whose identity was withheld, had picked up money from an 
Albertson's market at Sixth Street and Lincoln Avenue about noon and was 
walking out to an armored truck parked in front when he saw one of the robbers 
pulling out a handgun, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 The courier pulled out his gun and shot several times at the robber, who was 
struck and died at the scene, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 But another robber, apparently unseen by the courier, fired a number of shots, 
hitting the courier in the left arm and lower torso. The second robber fled in 
a car, possibly with an accomplice, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead bandit, whose name was not released pending notification of 
relatives, was wearing a woman's wig, a jumpsuit and makeup on his face, Burns 
said.

SWASTIKA SCARS OFFICE OF JEWISH ORGANIZATION; VANDALISM: PAINTING OF NAZI 
SYMBOL IN ORANGE IS FIFTH ANTI-SEMITIC INCIDENT REPORTED IN THE COUNTY THIS 
YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A swastika found spray-painted under the sign of the Jewish Family Service 
office on Monday is the fifth reported anti-Semitic incident in Orange County 
this year, and follows a record number of such crimes in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report released Monday by the Orange County Anti-Defamation 
League, 41 anti-Semitic acts were reported last year, up from 17 the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 That 141% increase compares to a national increase of 8%, the ADL's Audit of 
Anti-Semitic Incidents found. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another display of a cowardly act, someone who is just trying to take 
out his frustrations on someone else," said ADL Regional Director Jonathan 
Bernstein of Monday morning's vandalism.  
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the incidents last year were vandalism. The rest were 
assaults or threats, Bernstein said. Nationwide, the trend is the opposite: 
personal attacks outnumber attacks on property, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anti-Semites in Orange County are more cowardly and more comfortable just 
graffitiing a building and no one knows who did it," Bernstein said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mel Roth, executive director of Jewish Family Service, which provides 
counseling and social services, said this was the second such incident there 
this month; a swastika was found on Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it's harassment and it's part of the larger, larger wave of 
anti-Semitism I think is occurring both in the country and in Orange County," 
Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Police Sgt. Barry Weinstein said officers "are taking this very, very 
seriously. We are monitoring the area and increasing the patrols there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein said the ADL will "continue to work vigorously with victims and law 
enforcement, alerting them to trends that we see, and we plan to strengthen 
education efforts, getting speakers into schools to discuss these issues and 
make it a more tolerant society." Pinpointing Anti-Semitism 
</P>

 Reported anti-Semitic incidents in Orange County rose from 17 in 1992 to 41 in 
1993, with vandalism being the most prevalent act. Property incidents largely 
involved swastikas painted on public and private buildings; verbal and written 
anti-Semitic remarks made up most of the acts against people. A look at where 
anti-Semitism occurred in 1993: (map)

MAN DIES IN CRASH WITH AMBULANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 82-year-old man was killed Monday when he made a U-turn against a traffic 
light and collided with an out-of-service ambulance, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 James L. Breen of Laguna Niguel was traveling west on Alicia Parkway just 
before 10:30 a.m. when he turned onto Via Fabricante, said Lt. Dan Martini of 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department. Breen's 1987 Camaro was struck 
broadside by an out-of-service Life Fleet ambulance, which had a green light, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Breen was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, where he was 
pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambulance driver and a passenger were treated at the scene for minor 
injuries and complaints of pain, and were released.

GETTING THE JOBS DONE; THE SCENE: ONCE ATTENDEES LOCATE THE NEW RICHARD AND 
KAREN CARPENTER CENTER, THEY FIND IT AN IMPRESSIVE -- THOUGH A LITTLE STERILE 
-- VENUE.

 The new Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Center aced its first 
really, really big test last week, enduring the Northridge earthquake 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fared well," center executive director Rich Kerlin said between recent 
aftershocks. "We had no broken glass, no structural damage." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,162-seat hall at Cal State Long Beach seemed to handily survive another 
trial Sundaywith the presentation of its first touring troupe, Susanne Linke's 
modern-dance company of Frankfurt, Germany. While not their without gripes, 
many in attendance gave the place a thumbs-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a nice theater," said Neil Elliott, a Redondo Beach engineer. 
"It's impressive, it's big." 
</P>
<P>
 "The seats are really comfortable," said Michelle Wilson, a CSULB 
communications major. 
</P>
<P>
 The $27-million center, a crescent-shaped, streamlined facility completed in 
December, will present events ranging from Tex-Mex music to film to comedy. It 
operates under a public-private partnership with the university, where siblings 
Karen and Richard Carpenter majored in music in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Just beside it sits the Martha B. Knoebel Theater, a 245-seat venue designed 
exclusively for dance and which will be used mostly for campus events. It is 
expected to open in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of signage on the center itself or posted on nearby streets was a 
common complaint Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent 15 minutes driving around" before finding it, said Los Angeles 
choreographer Rose Polesky. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior signs identifying seat rows would help too, patrons said. And, while 
many admired the theater's gently curved, floor-to-ceiling glass facade, its 
airy lobby and muted purple, aqua and burgundy color scheme, some wished for 
adornment on its expansive blank walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need a Chagall mural," like that inside New York's Metropolitan Opera 
house, said Ricardo Trimillos, a UCLA visiting professor of world arts and 
culture. "When you look in from outside, it's very sterile." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kerlin, the theater will soon have signs installed at its main 
entrance, at street entrances to its 700-space, front-yard parking lot, as well 
as signage inside, guiding patrons to restrooms and to seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Artwork will be added to the walls, he said, and the theater may ask Long 
Beach city officials for street signs as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Many patrons, however, praised the new facility, named in honor of Richard 
Carpenter's $1 million donation toward its endowment. It was designed by Irvine 
architect Kurt Gibbs, who designed CSULB's new arena, still under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Steeply raked seats providing easy viewing and its acoustics won high marks.  
</P>
<P>
 "Both speaking voices and recorded sound were very clear," said Trimillos, who 
also is a musician and ethnomusicologist. "The sight lines were very good too. 
We sat about eight rows back, near stage left, but we took a walk around the 
entire hall" before the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased with the sound," Kerlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 CSULB dance department chairwoman Joan Schlaich, who hatched the idea for the 
center and the Knoebel hall 22 years ago, said Sunday that design plans to 
"make the audience feel very close to the performers" succeeded -- at least 
from where she sat in the middle of the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The capacity can be scaled back to 765 seats for smaller events. The center's 
large stage, modeled after the New York State Theater's, is 70 feet wide by 65 
feet deep, officials said, and has a so-called floating floor, identical to 
those in seven new dance classrooms adjacent the Knoebel Theater, named for a 
Long Beach philanthropist. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancers in Linke's athletic piece, "RUHR-ORT," who tromped, jogged and flung 
their bodies onto the stage, pronounced it "perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's big and wide and like a stage for dance is supposed to be," said Ari 
Fastman, who has performed around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Large dance troupes, from New York City Ballet to the Martha Graham Dance 
Company, may be booked at the center, Kerlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But much of its programming will target the area's "underserved and 
underrepresented audiences," he said, including gays and lesbians, Latinos and 
seniors, in order to avoid competition with local producing arts organizations 
or other nearby theaters. The Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, the 
Terrace Theater in Long Beach and the Orange County Performing Arts Center are 
each roughly within a 20-minute drive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a definite need in the region for a mid-size hall that's 
professionally operated," Kerlin said. Ticket prices will be kept between $12 
and $20, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Construction was financed with state bonds, but it will operate without 
additional government subsidy. Its initial operating budget, Kerlin said, will 
be about $500,000 annually, generated from facility rentals, ticket sales, 
parking fees and other revenue sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's first full season begins Feb. 12 with the Nat Adderley jazz 
quintet. It will proceed with comedian Paul Rodriguez (March 12), the San 
Francisco Girls Chorus (March 27), the Joe Goode Performance Group (April 16), 
and country/Tejano singer Tish Hinojosa (May 5). 
</P>
<P>
 An official grand opening and gala will be held in the fall with an all-star 
tribute to the Carpenters' music, Kerlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most CSULB music productions will continue to be held in the 278-seat Gerald 
R. Daniel Recital Hall in the University Music Center adjacent to the new 
facility. College theater productions will be held in the 387-seat University 
Theater, on the school's south end. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Center is at Cal State Long 
Beach, 6200 Atherton Drive, just west of Palo Verde Avenue at the northeast end 
of the campus. Parking, in front of the theater, is $2 per vehicle. (310) 
985-7000.

FOURPLAY'S SECRET: THEY'RE ALL FOR ONE, ONE FOR ALL; JAZZ: GUITARIST LEE 
RITENOUR ATTRIBUTES THE SUCCESS OF THE GROUP, WHICH PLAYS THE COACH HOUSE 
TONIGHT, TO ITS 'CONTINUOUS DIALOGUE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guitarist Lee Ritenour is enjoying the best of both worlds. His solo project, 
the Wes Montgomery tribute album "Wes Bound" (GRP), as well as his group 
recording, Fourplay's "Between the Sheets" (Warner Bros.), have been firmly 
entrenched on Billboard's jazz albums charts since their releases last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Long popular as a contemporary guitarist, Ritenour, who appears with Fourplay 
tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, has never been more visible. 
</P>
<P>
 His career "has evolved a lot farther than I thought it would when I was first 
starting out," Ritenour said in a phone conversation from his home in Malibu. 
"I'm surprised that I've made 20 albums and come this far. It's interesting 
that in my early days I was aspiring to be a studio musician, but aspiring to 
an artist as well -- I always had dreams of playing live." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Ritenour's recent success has come via Fourplay, the big-name 
amalgamation of crossover artists that includes Ritenour, keyboardist Bob 
James, bassist Nathan East and drummer Harvey Mason. Both of the band's 
recordings, including "Between the Sheets," have spent record lengths atop the 
contemporary jazz charts. Critical response to the band has been another 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fourplay gets trashed a lot," Ritenour explained, "and we're used to that 
one. Unfortunately, reviewers kind of lose sight of certain aspects of 
Fourplay, they miss a lot of the elements that come together in Fourplay. 
</P>
<P>
 "One is the extreme rhythmical tightness of the band. Another is the 
interplay, the way we fit together, and the interplay that happens both 
rhythmically and melodically in the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times, four superstar jazz guys get together and they all go off in 
their own directions. I could name numerous units as examples of that kind of 
thing. But when you see Fourplay work together, you see this continuous 
dialogue going on, a sponsorship and appreciation of each other that results in 
this extreme interplay. No individual ego at all. There are four distinct 
stylists, but those four styles work so well together. That's the amazing thing 
about our chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourplay came about when keyboardist James gathered Ritenour, East and Mason 
to record his 1990 album "Grand Piano Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt really nice, and we began to wonder if we could get together and do a 
group project," he said. "Along the way it worked out and the first record 
(1991's "Fourplay") went through the roof. So then we had to make room for 
Fourplay in our individual careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It usually happens the other way around," he added. "People join groups when 
they are young, and then they want to go off and have solo careers. But that 
wasn't the case with Fourplay. We were all very firmly established." 
</P>
<P>
 Ritenour, 41, was born in Hollywood and first came before the public eye 
recording with Sergio Mendes, Gato Barbieri, Herbie Hancock and Carly Simon, 
among others. He's released a string of successful solo albums, beginning in 
1976 with "Guitar Player" and continuing through "Captain Fingers," "Rit" and 
the acoustic "Rio." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ritenour's solo career took a turn from the commercial this year with the 
release of "Wes Bound." 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly didn't try to copy Wes," he said of the project. "There's still 
Lee Ritenour written all over it." 
</P>
<P>
 There are, nevertheless, parallels between Montgomery's career and his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wes had these really deep roots and was a strong, straight-ahead player, but 
he also opened up the music to other possibilities. He was tremendously 
criticized for his pop-crossover work, and in some cases, rightfully so. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he was really the first, back in 1966 and '68 to create the kind of 
pop-jazz crossover that later really started to happen. Wes could get into rock 
'n' roll rhythms or straight eighths or the Brazilian styles with a fluidness 
that hardly anyone else could do at that time. The contemporary flavors that he 
created still hold up today." 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of thinking, Ritenour said, influences his own approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that I'll be doing another tribute album. But I feel a strong 
attraction to Wes' music, and I want to continue to explore the straight-ahead 
style, combining it with the kind of contemporary style that I've done in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lately, it seems like there are two camps on this. . . . A lot of young 
players (are) doing strictly straight-ahead, and then there's the guys who 
blazed the early fusion trails. And I think those styles are going to merge 
again, as they did in the early '70s." 
</P>
<P>
 That direction may also influence Fourplay's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like digging into the past and exploring the traditional guitar styles. And 
I wouldn't be surprised if Fourplay starts to dive into that area a little bit 
as well. But for now, we'll do what we do best, which is come up with a lot of 
great grooves along with a lot of great melodies." 
</P>
<P>
 * Fourplay performs tonight at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San 
Juan Capistrano, 8 p.m., $25. (714) 496-8927. Also Wednesday at the the Strand, 
1700 S. Pacific Coast Highway, 7 and 10 p.m., $23.50. (310) 316-1700.

PHILIPPE ENTREMONT IS PLAYING HIS NUMBERS RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Self-conducted performances of Beethoven's Triple Concerto are uncommon at 
best. It's rarer still that a visiting orchestra should offer a work that 
requires not one traveling soloist, not two, but . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Two and a half, as I say," said Philippe Entremont, who leads the Dresden 
Philharmonic Orchestra and serves as piano soloist, tonight in Costa Mesa in an 
Orange County Philharmonic Society-sponsored concert. Violinist Cho-Liang Lin 
and cellist Carter Brey account for the whole numbers in his equation. 
</P>
<P>
 As for leading the middle-period Beethoven work from the keyboard, Entremont 
said, "I have never done it another way. This is like a chamber-music work, not 
an overblown piece at all, and we do it like we're doing chamber music." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dresden Philharmonic was founded in 1870. In its early years, Brahms and 
Tchaikovsky conducted their own music with the orchestra; Entremont has also 
scheduled works by those composers, the "Academic Festival" Overture and 
"Little Russian" Symphony, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I am a little worried by tradition," Entremont, 60, admitted, "but 
you must not be too affected by it. Most of the time, composers are not great 
conductors." 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in France, Entremont is lifetime music director of the Vienna 
Chamber Orchestra, and last year he assumed the post of principal conductor of 
the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra. He outlined his status with the Dresden 
orchestra, now on its first U.S. tour: "The best position you can dream of -- I 
am guest."  
</P>
<P>
 With his extensive background in French music (among a plethora of 
distinctions, he is former president of the Ravel Academy in St. Jean-de-Luz), 
Entremont admits it's a switch conducting "middle-European" ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still play French music as much as I can," he said. "But I am not going to 
Vienna and say we don't do Schubert and Mozart. I am not stupid. I would last 
two weeks!" 
</P>
<P>
 Entremont's birthplace is Rheims, the center of the Champagne region. Though 
he grew up in Paris and has visited Rheims just once in the past 40 years, he 
retains a sparkling enthusiasm: "You can have Rheims in your own home," he 
pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, much that he feels seriously about. "Your country has to 
realize that if nothing is done about the arts, there will be a slow process of 
disintegration," he warned. "You cannot count on the private sector anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Entremont knows of what he speaks. In addition to leading the Vienna Chamber 
Ensemble since 1976, he spent nearly a decade at the helm of American 
orchestras, first the New Orleans Philharmonic, later the Denver Symphony. The 
Denver group dissolved amid money troubles shortly after Entremont resigned in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not richer in Europe, but we care. Everything is subsidized, so it is 
inconceivable in Europe for an orchestra to go under. (In the United States) 
even well-known orchestras are on the edge of the razor all of the time. The 
number of American musicians looking for jobs outside of America is terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Entremont has earned five Grand Prix du Disque awards, most notably for his 
recordings of the complete piano music of Ravel, and for piano concertos of 
Ravel and Bartok. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, he downplayed those accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am highly suspicious of the way these decisions are made," he said. 
"Everything is arranged in advance -- come on, let's be candid. The recording 
companies, I think, have a lot to say in that. Just like the Grammy." 
</P>
<P>
 "The same with books, the Prix Goncourt in France. . . . I am not impressed 
with these kinds of awards." 
</P>
<P>
 Then such decisions are often political, as in the case of, say, dog shows? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no -- you see the dog, eh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Entremont feels very differently about being named a Knight of the Legion 
d'Honneur, and about the First Class Cross of Honor for the Arts and Sciences 
recently bestowed on him by the Austrian government. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's OK," he said. "That one I think I deserve richly. I have done enough 
for Austria. They give you that if you have been long enough surviving Vienna, 
and I am on my 18th year with the orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
 * Philippe Entremont leads the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra in works by 
Beethoven, Brahms and Tchaikovsky tonight at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Entremont will also be piano 
soloist, along with violinist Cho-Liang Lin and cellist Carter Brey, in 
Beethoven's "Triple Concerto" in C, Opus 56. Presented by the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society. $15-$45. (714) 740-2000.

PRECAUTIONS PROTECT O.C. ART COLLECTIONS

 At Orange County museums, officials say they use standard techniques and 
equipment to help guard against earthquake damage -- although, of course, none 
are guaranteed against the force of a major upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Gray, director of design and facilities at Newport Harbor Art Museum in 
Newport Beach, explained that the storage area for paintings and large 
sculptures is padded, and "everything is strapped down or bungee-corded." 
Smaller items sit on carpeting so they won't shift, and netting is placed 
around steel storage bins to catch anything that might fall out. All the 
shelving units and files are bolted to the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the exhibition galleries, Gray said, portable wall systems are strapped 
to the ceiling and objects are "as well attached as possible to the floor or 
exhibition furniture." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Laguna Art Museum, according to Bolton Colburn, curator of collections, 
the on-site vault contains a compact storage system for paintings. The rows of 
racks rest on wheels that are stabilized so as not to sway or jump out of their 
tracks in the event of seismic tremors. Drawings are stored in boxes nestled on 
metal racks with safety lips guarding their edges. 
</P>
<P>
 In the galleries, the Laguna Beach museum adheres small objects to their bases 
with museum wax or silicone. Paintings are secured with double sets of hooks 
(screw eyes and D-rings, the museum term for metal picture hangers). In some 
cases, the works are also attached with a plastic strap resembling an 
extra-strength hospital bracelet, which must be cut to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Langston, marketing and public relations director at the Bowers Museum 
of Cultural Art in Santa Ana, said the 1992 addition to the building was 
designed "to exceed all modern earthquake codes," and the collection storage 
system was specifically designed to be earthquake-resistant. Shelving rests on 
big rubber wheels with miniature "shock absorbers," and all of the shelves have 
attached netting. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibition cases in the galleries were designed with most of their weight 
concentrated on the bottom, Langston said. Thick plexiglass covers the objects. 
Particularly valuable items are secured to their cases in four directions with 
lengths of monofilament line clad in a clear, bumper-like plastic tube and 
fastened with thin wire nails. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole case would have to (topple) over for an object to be damaged," 
Langston said. CATHY CURTIS

PROPERTY VALUES: EARTHQUAKE LEAVES MORTGAGE CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RON GALPERIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Rose recovered from the initial shock of last week's earthquake, she 
began to worry about her two-bedroom Tarzana condo and how the earthquake would 
affect her plans to refinance her mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, who does not want her last name used, was one of the lucky ones. The 
interior of her condo suffered only cosmetic damage, and the complex itself 
seems to have fared pretty well. Getting a new loan on the condo will probably 
be more complicated now, however. Plus, Rose's tenants packed up and moved two 
days after the quake because they couldn't stand the shaking anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to sort through what I'm going to do," Rose said. "I was hoping a new 
loan would be approved soon so that I could save money on my mortgage," she 
said. "But my gut feeling is that it's going to be put on hold." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners who sustained serious damage from the Northridge temblor are 
obviously in a quandary about what to do. There are many more people lucky 
enough to have suffered very little damage, but they are still worried about 
their property values and prospects for getting their mortgages refinanced, and 
whether pending sales of property will actually go through. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still figuring out what our policy is going to be," said Kathy 
Marshel, Los Angeles regional manager at Chase Manhattan Personal Financial 
Services, which has offices in Encino. "The process is going to get delayed -- 
especially in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision of what to do with particular loans is being made on a 
"case-by-case basis," Marshel said. "We want to make sure we have a solid piece 
of collateral." In some cases, Chase Manhattan will send out an appraiser for a 
second look. If an initial review suggests there may be a problem, she said, 
then an inspector will be asked to take a close look at any earthquake-related 
damages. Figuring what a property is worth after all the earth movements is 
very uncertain, Marshel conceded. "It's a very tough judgment call to make." 
</P>
<P>
 "The procedure that we're going to be following is what's required by the VA, 
FHA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other investors," said Ann Pennywitt, vice 
president at ARCS Mortgage Inc. in Calabasas. "We're all going to be driven by 
what the secondary mortgage market requires," she added. "Secondary market 
investors (those who buy mortgages) don't want a re-verification of value, they 
want to know if there has been substantial damage to the property." 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are going through the process of getting a loan with us will have 
to show that there are no visible signs of damage to their property from the 
earthquake." Some properties will have to be inspected, others will need 
reappraisal. When there is a reassessment of the appraisal, Pennywitt said, 
"the appraiser will have to address . . . what market value losses may have 
occurred as a result of the quake." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be other new demands. Because many businesses have been adversely 
affected by all the shaking, Pennywitt said, "we'll require reverification of 
employment for certain loans." On government-backed loans, she said, lenders 
will generally want any damage to a property to be repaired before the loan is 
made. If damage to a property is not substantial, she said, lenders may agree 
to close a loan so long as repair money is set aside in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 All this extra work will lengthen the loan process, Pennywitt predicted. At 
ARCS' headquarters last week, staffers and outside contractors were using hair 
dryers and clotheslines to dry out documents that were soaked when its building 
was flooded. Pennywitt remains optimistic about moving things along, though. 
"We're hearing from some of our loan officers that they can accomplish the 
extra paperwork in just a few days," she said. And, loans that were supposed to 
close within the next two weeks will have their loan-rate lock-in period 
extended. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis B. Ellman, a real estate partner at the Century City law firm 
Greenberg, Glusker, Fields, Claman & Machtinger and a resident of Encino, 
reports that he has received numerous calls from clients with questions about 
pending sales and other real estate transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a residence is significantly damaged or destroyed, buyers generally have a 
right to cancel a sales contract and tenants can terminate their lease," Ellman 
said. "I think there will be purchasers who will attempt to either terminate 
their escrows or obtain a reduction of the purchase price based on the fact 
that the neighborhood has changed because of the earthquake. I don't believe, 
however, that the law will give them relief in this situation," Ellman said. 
Most courts will only allow the sales transaction to be canceled if there has 
been serious damage to the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 While the risk of a property being destroyed traditionally passed to a buyer 
as soon as a purchase contract was signed, that's no longer the case. The risk 
does not pass from seller to buyer until escrow closes or until a buyer takes 
possession -- whichever comes first, Ellman said. Real estate contracts were 
also traditionally not considered to be time sensitive like other types of 
contracts. Most residential sales contracts in California, however, provide 
that "time is of essence" in closing the deal. If a seller can make needed 
repairs within a reasonable time beyond the intended closing date of a sale, 
most courts will still consider the buyer obligated, Ellman said. If the 
repairs would take a long time, the buyer is more likely to get off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 These are confusing times and all the rules are uncertain, said Joe Conrad, 
president of the Spectrum Group, a Woodland Hills-based mortgage brokerage, and 
a board member of the California Assn. of Mortgage Brokers, Los Angeles 
chapter. Lenders will continue to make money available, Conrad said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're in the process of getting a loan, lenders are not overly concerned 
with cosmetic cracks but with structural damage. They want to know the impact 
on property value," Conrad said. "The majority of lenders don't want to know 
about damage to the neighborhood but damage to the structure." Besides, he 
averred, "you could make an argument that the value of properties in damaged 
neighborhoods has gone up because there's less to choose from." 
</P>
<P>
 A house that was worth $200,000 two weeks ago is probably still worth 
$200,000, assuming there has been no structural damage, Conrad said. "The 
current level of concern will pass," he said. "If anything, the earthquake may 
create a shortage of available housing and in the long term, all this may help 
fuel the local economy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody really knows where values are going except by complete conjecture," 
said Mark Soroko, manager and vice president of the Bank of Hollywood in Toluca 
Lake, which makes commercial loans and brokers residential loans. "I don't 
think we have a true handle yet on the damage," Soroko said. "Time will tell 
what the trend will be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, "people are still in a state of shock."

 William C. Markham, president and chief executive officer of Antelope Valley 
Newspapers Inc., earlier this month purchased the shares of Richard Lamont 
Odett Jr., bringing an end to the Odett family's partial ownership in the 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides declined to say how many shares were sold and at what price. The 
company publishes the Antelope Valley Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the Markham family owned the Valley News, predecessor of the Daily 
News, which they sold to the Tribune Co. In 1985, the Tribune Co. sold the 
Daily News to financier Jack Kent Cooke.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; VALLEY 'TENT CITIES' ENDURE RAIN AS RESIDENTS 
REFUSE TO GO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER and TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
 Cold rain poured down Monday night on four San Fernando Valley "tent cities" 
erected to shelter about 4,000 earthquake refugees -- many of them driven by 
fear of aftershocks to remain outdoors even though their apartments and houses 
had been declared safe to reoccupy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were still so afraid of the gradually dwindling tremors that they 
insisted on sleeping on the cold ground, refusing cots offered by the Salvation 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people don't want anything but the ground," said Salvation Army Maj. 
Darvin Carpenter at the center in Lanark Park in Canoga Park, where about 1,200 
people were huddled under canvas for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be difficult if it rains long and hard. I wish I could tell you 
it won't be messy, but it will," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvation Army officials estimated there were another 1,000 to 1,500 people in 
tents at the Winnetka Recreation Center and Park, where Roman Catholic Cardinal 
Roger M. Mahony urged some of them to return to their homes if they had been 
declared safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they're afraid to go," traumatized by their narrow escapes and the 
continuing rumbles in the earth, Mahony said as he stood under an umbrella in 
the rain outside a Salvation Army canteen. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Federal Emergency Management Agency officials who said they had been 
working since 7 a.m. continued filling out application relief forms as refugees 
lined up for supper of tuna sandwiches and soup. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain began falling shortly before 8 p.m. Hail struck Agoura Hills and snow 
closed the Grapevine, the pass carrying Interstate 5 over the mountains about 
50 miles to the north of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,500 people gathered in the tents at Reseda Park, said Red Cross site 
Manager Bill Fletcher. From 600 to 1,200 others occupied tents at Valley Plaza 
Park in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 A dwindling number hung on in private tents and other makeshift shelters in 
parks outside the tent cities -- erected by the National Guard when rain was 
forecast. In the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill Division, which 
covers Arleta and Pacoima, the number shrank to about 200 -- about 60 at Paxton 
Park, another 35 at Devonwood Park and 125 at Hansen Dam, a police spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While much of the attention about last week's 6.6-magnitude earthquake has 
been focused on places of large-scale destruction and places where people died 
near the epicenter, the quake's destructive force left no Valley community 
unaffected, leaving thousands homeless and touching off reactions ranging from 
gas main explosions to street floods to a train derailment and even an oil 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Water supplies were cut and contaminated in many parts of the Valley after the 
quake, and reports of illness from drinking water persisted Monday even in 
those areas previously declared safe, although city water officials maintained 
that factors other than water -- such as food handling -- might be to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times computer analysis of statistics released Monday by the city Building 
and Safety Department showed that inspectors declared unsafe 45% of the nearly 
17,000 dwellings inspected so far on the Valley floor. Citywide, 40% of 35,000 
dwellings inspected were found unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sheer size of the catastrophe -- which damaged areas in Los Angeles, 
Ventura and Orange counties -- began to cause some dissension. Residents in 
some communities complained that other areas had received speedier attention 
from the government. For example, while city officials in Glendale and San 
Fernando were able to persuade federal officials to open FEMA application 
centers in their cities Monday, some San Fernando Valley residents complained 
that they were being ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 In the northeast Valley, about 30 residents of a quake-damaged Pacoima 
neighborhood traveled in a caravan to City Councilman Richard Alarcon's Sylmar 
office, where they demanded -- and got -- promises from the councilman's 
surprised staff that they would receive deliveries of blankets, food, 
disposable diapers and medicine. About one-quarter of the more than 2,000 
dwellings inspected in Alarcon's district have been deemed unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters also charged that city and FEMA officials had passed over 
Pacoima when they located disaster assistance centers, and called for the 
establishment of a center there. 
</P>
<P>
 Protest organizer Efren Olvera, a local Neighborhood Watch activist, said many 
of the protesters -- who live in quake-damaged units near the intersection of 
Haddon Avenue and Mercer Street -- do not have cars and could not easily reach 
existing disaster assistance centers in Sunland and San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 While the protesters asserted that their community was being neglected by 
disaster officials because the people who live there are among the poorest in 
the Valley, Alarcon said he and other officials simply didn't know services 
were needed in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, there are people congregating at many, many sites throughout 
the district," Alarcon said. "There are going to be small groups of people who 
are going to be missed. I would only encourage more and more people to give 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said that FEMA is considering setting up a disaster assistance center 
in Pacoima and that he will continue to press for one. In the meantime, his 
office has made arrangements for Metropolitan Transit Authority buses to 
transport people to disaster assistance centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Francine Oschin, an aide to Councilman Hal Bernson, sees things a little 
differently. Oschin said Bernson's district, which includes Chatsworth, 
Northridge and Granada Hills, deserves special treatment because it suffered 
some of the most devastating damage, but is not getting its fair share of 
community services. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two-thirds of 6,230 homes inspected so far in the northwest Valley 
were found unsafe, but Oschin said there is only one FEMA center in Northridge, 
providing just 900 housing vouchers. She said some areas with very little 
damage are getting as much attention and services as Northridge, the epicenter 
of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Oschin complained that the FEMA services are being distributed "based on 
equality and not based on urgency." 
</P>
<P>
 But most other Valley council members said their districts are getting a fair 
share of the services and attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to charges that her West Valley district -- where half of the more 
than 5,400 dwellings inspected are considered unsafe -- is getting more 
attention than it deserves, Councilwoman Laura Chick said: "If they think we 
are getting too much attention then they need to get into a bus and see the 
devastation we have here. I have no tolerance for this tug of war." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Hamlin, public affairs officer for FEMA, said the agency is doing the 
best it can, given the wide swath of destruction created by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working disasters with FEMA since 1981, and this is the quickest 
response I've ever seen. Even though we live in the microwave age, we can't 
push a button and make it better overnight. There are going to be a lot of 
people who are upset and angry because they have been through a very serious 
situation and it takes some time to help people put their lives back together. 
We are providing assistance equally. We are honestly doing the best that we 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the reopening of many schools, two Valley charter schools in the 
northeast Valley -- Fenton Avenue Elementary in Lake View Terrace and Vaughn 
Street Elementary in Pacoima -- opened their classrooms to students Monday for 
the first time since the quake. Teachers and administrators rallied to address 
the needs of students traumatized by the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the temblor struck from beneath a Northridge street corner, 
killing 57 and leaving thousands homeless, damage estimates are still only 
preliminary, but estimates reflect the widespread damage caused by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Pacoima, a neighborhood has become like a ghost town after residents 
packed up and left, fearing another strong jolt would finish the job of 
knocking down their apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Glendale, official damage estimates exceed $20 million as workers have 
counted more than 500 damaged buildings and declared 33 of them unsafe -- 
including two large parking garages. 
</P>
<P>
 * In San Fernando, 63 buildings were destroyed, 22% of the city's housing 
stock was damaged and there was about $31 million in damage. The Los Angeles 
County Superior Court building, which houses 12 courtrooms, suffered extensive 
damage and will be closed for about a year, said court officials. Much of the 
San Fernando operations will be relocated to Van Nuys, which is undergoing its 
own earthquake cleanup. "It honestly looks like someone set a bomb off," said 
Superior Court Judge Judith Ashmann, who supervises operations in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Burbank, more than 200 earthquake victims are staying overnight at the 
American Red Cross shelter at McCambridge Park, refugees from at least 20 
uninhabitable buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Calabasas, city officials estimate $325,000 in damage, including 20 units 
in a 100-unit condo complex that were left uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Along Ventura Boulevard -- the Valley's main thoroughfare -- from Warner 
Center to Studio City, shopping malls are closed, restaurants have been gutted 
by fire, and hundreds of homes have been "red-tagged," declared uninhabitable, 
leaving thousands homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 As communities wrangled over distribution of earthquake aid, some said they 
would prefer that the quake had spared them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not in competition with anyone," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who 
represents parts of Sherman Oaks and Studio City. "We would have been happy not 
to get any damage at all." 
</P>
<P>

Johnson, and special correspondents Scott Glover, Jill Leovy and Teresa Ann 
Willis contributed to this story.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; ANTELOPE VALLEY GETS METROLINK A DECADE EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER and ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The plan was to start commuter train service to the northernmost reaches of 
Los Angeles County in about a decade. But that plan didn't include a 6.6 
earthquake that would knock freeways out of service. 
</P>
<P>
 So in the pre-dawn darkness Monday, one week nearly to the minute after the 
devastating Northridge quake, Metrolink service began in the Antelope Valley, a 
service that will probably remain in effect even after the freeways are 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 For Palmdale resident Mark Collison, the conversion from motorist to train 
rider took only a few attempts last week to reach his job in Burbank by 
freeway. He switched to the Metrolink out of Santa Clarita last week and on 
Monday was among the first 400 people to board the train in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of the 250-person work force at the stainless-steel manufacturing 
firm where Collison works live in the Antelope or Santa Clarita valleys. "We'll 
be having production meetings on the train," Collison said. 
</P>
<P>
 With repairs on the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways not expected to 
be completed for a year, Richard Stanger, executive director of Metrolink, said 
commuters from north Los Angeles County have become a captive audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink ridership has soared since the earthquake, with nearly all of the 
increase from the Santa Clarita and just-opened Antelope Valley stations. Total 
ridership from the two stations was expected to reach 16,000 Monday, compared 
to 13,000 Friday and 1,000 before the quake from Santa Clarita. Ridership 
systemwide has jumped from 10,000 to 25,000 since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great. It was very non-stressful, very relaxing," said Timothy 
Velasquez, 40, of Quartz Hill, as he stepped onto the platform at the newly 
built Palmdale station about 6:30 p.m. Monday, ending a day that began with a 3 
a.m. wake-up to catch a 4:26 a.m. train. 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez said he is considering sticking with Metrolink, even though the 
round trip to his job in Glendale takes more than four hours, about an hour 
more than in the van pool he previously used. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena, who was helicoptered to the 
Antelope Valley for a short visit Sunday and then on Monday rode the Metrolink 
from Santa Clarita to Downtown Los Angeles, said auto ride-sharing also will be 
critical in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Necessity, he said, should put an end to the predominance of single-occupant 
cars, at least in some parts of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley commuters, already contending with lengthy commutes to their 
San Fernando Valley and Downtown work sites, are facing very long travel times. 
Monday morning, traffic through the southbound Golden State and Antelope Valley 
freeways' detour was backed up as much as two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol Officer Glen Dominguez credited the relative calm on 
commuter familiarity with the alternate routes, employers instituting flexible 
schedules, increased car-pooling and the Metrolink expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning last week, Lancaster resident Dennis Marks spent four hours trying 
to get to work. Other mornings it took him three. On Monday, Marks boarded a 
Metrolink train in Lancaster for the first time and said he was "going to try 
it and see" if it was a viable solution to get him to his Studio City job. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they came out in droves Monday, some riders expressed concern about 
the cost of Metrolink. Riders who catch the train in Lancaster or Palmdale must 
pay $208 for a monthly pass, $65 for a 10-trip ticket or $14 each for 
round-trip tickets, which will be on sale at the Lancaster and Palmdale 
stations beginning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink head Stanger noted that for residents who ride from Lancaster to 
downtown Los Angeles, the cost of a monthly pass is equivalent to 7 cents per 
mile, compared to 5 cents per mile for the cost of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means getting up earlier and leaving sooner," said Daniel Curvin, who 
lives in Valencia and teaches at a Burbank elementary school. "I'm getting 
tired of this, and I think a lot of other people are too." 
</P>
<P>
 "How safe is this if there is an aftershock?" asked Jane Roffi, a financial 
consultant who lives in Saugus, answering her question: "It's got to be better 
than driving on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 While the train is competitive on a time basis for now because of the 
horrendous traffic, Stanger said work is already under way to reduce the 
two-hour, 25-minute travel time between Lancaster and Union Station. Within 
just a few weeks, the trip will be reduced to two hours by signal and track 
improvements, Stanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, Burbank debuted as a major transportation connection point 
as hundreds of commuters from Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley stepped off the 
Metrolink platform there and stepped into waiting shuttles, vans, buses, cabs 
and car pools to make connections to their jobs or classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ironic thing is that I lived in New York City for two years and never had 
to take a train or subway," said Ed Burke of Santa Clarita, as he waited for 
his car pool to his advertising job at Sony Pictures in Culver City. Monday was 
the first day since the earthquake that Burke tried to get to work. Last week 
he worked from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Mclawyer, Metrolink line supervisor at Burbank, estimated that there were 
1,500 to 1,700 passengers from Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley getting off at 
Burbank on Monday morning. About 400 got off the first train, arriving just 
before 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Some employers arranged shuttle service for their workers, and drivers held up 
placards with company names on them for commuters to find their way. Other 
commuters had arranged for a car pool or a friend to meet them, or lined up at 
the pay phones to call someone to pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had about eight buses here," said Jerry Broomfield, a bus driver for UCLA, 
as he read the morning paper spread over the steering wheel at the midpoint of 
the morning rush. "We've only used two of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Broomfield guessed that not everyone was aware of the service, free to UCLA 
students or faculty members who buy Metrolink tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the new train riders missed the freedom, independence and flexibility 
of using their own automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink workers were handing out flyers explaining how to buy tickets, with 
a listing of departure and arrival times on the back -- along with detailed 
instructions on how to read a timetable. 
</P>
<P>
 G. William Lundgren, transportation administrator for the city of Burbank, 
said passengers were having a smoother time making their connections than last 
week. "There's a lot of people helping each other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just disappointed that there were no restrooms or free coffee," said Marc 
Gagnon, who lives in Santa Clarita and works in the wardrobe department at 
Warner Bros. He said he especially misses being able to drive to Burbank, where 
he can stop at a coffee shop and read the paper before going into work in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 He also missed driving his Honda Civic, which costs him $40 a month for gas. 
"This is costing me $144 a month," said Gagnon, who got out of bed at 3 a.m. 
and left the house at 4 a.m. to catch his train. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they're taking into account the total cost of an automobile," 
said Judith Johnston-Weston, executive director for the Burbank Media District 
Transportation Management Organization, which saw the ridership on its shuttles 
between the station and employers increase sixfold because of the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 She argued that the train still costs a lot less than a car, considering the 
payments, maintenance, insurance, parking and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been waiting for at least a half an hour," said Joe Kennedy, a driver 
for Celebrity Cab Co. "They put too many cabs on the stand." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, who picked up fares from the station last week, said that business 
was slower than expected for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between all the vans and shuttles, I think people are being served quite 
adequately," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metrolink station parking lot was nearly full Sunday night, with the cars 
of commuters who had parked them there for convenient use once they got off the 
train. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patience is running thin," said Kris Benavidez, of Santa Clarita, as she 
waited in line to use a pay phone to call someone to take her to her job in 
Burbank as a sales manager. "It's hard to get up early in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, state lawmakers Monday approved a $400,000 grant toward the 
construction of the Sylmar Metrolink station and an adjacent child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate passed a bill by Herschel Rosenthal (D-West Los Angeles) that would 
make $300,000 immediately available to the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority for station construction and $100,000 for the child-care center next 
to the commuter train stop at 1st and Hubbard streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire amount had originally been earmarked for the child-care center and 
was included in the 1992-93 state budget. But because of federal guidelines 
governing use of the money, which comes from a special account, lawmakers had 
to amend its distribution and rushed to approve its disbursement in advance of 
the 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), who represents Sylmar, said the 
money was especially vital because "the region's damaged transportation network 
threatens the economic stability and tens of thousands of jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill has been sent to Gov. Pete Wilson's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials hope the $1.7-million construction project, which has 
been plagued by delays, will be completed within a few months.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CHARTER SCHOOL STUDENTS RETURN TO CAMPUSES; 
AFTERMATH: MANY EXPRESS FEAR OF ANOTHER QUAKE. SOME PARENTS ADMIT WORRY ABOUT 
BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One week after a powerful earthquake rocked their homes and jangled their 
nerves, students at the Valley's two charter schools returned to campus, some 
talkative, others withdrawn, but all offering a preview for the rest of the 
mammoth district of the struggles that lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Using their flexibility as charter schools, Vaughn Street Elementary in 
Pacoima and Fenton Avenue Elementary in Lake View Terrace opened their doors 
Monday morning, one day before regular schools in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 At both schools, attendance was low, but teachers and counselors still 
scrambled to assess the psychological and physical needs of the students who 
showed up, as administrators attempted to determine the whereabouts of those 
who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students expressed fear of another quake, and some parents admitted that 
they were worried about being separated from their children. At Fenton, which 
suffered significant cosmetic but no structural damage in the quake, about 100 
of nearly 775 students showed up for the first full day of class. Principal 
Joseph Lucente attributed the low turnout to miscommunication. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Vaughn -- now called the Next Century Learning Center -- where teachers 
and administrators went door to door last week with flyers announcing the 
opening of school, 397 of nearly 700 students arrived for the first of two 
consecutive half-days. Administrators at Vaughn identified 47 students rendered 
homeless by the quake who dressed for school in the parking lots, cars or parks 
where they are now living. They anticipated that many of the absent were 
homeless as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high number of absentees, the atmosphere on campus before school 
appeared normal, with many children playing with soccer balls and talking to 
friends on the playground. But after the morning bell rang, clusters of 
students, parents, and teachers gathered and lingered, comparing quake stories 
and sharing fears. 
</P>
<P>
 For some students, school offered a comforting change from the disruption 
caused by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, it simply meant more worries.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy and sad," said 10-year-old Arnulfo Villalobos, who is sleeping in a 
parking lot with his parents, brothers, nieces and nephews. "If the big one 
comes and my family dies, I want to be over there with them when they die." 
</P>
<P>
 But Faviola Rangel, a 12-year-old, said she felt safer at school than at her 
grandmother's house, where she moved when her family's Pacoima apartment was 
destroyed by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just staying in the house I get scared," Faviola said. "I wanted to come to 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 For parents, some of whom stayed at school after the bell, talking to one 
another or helping in the school's parent center, emotions about the quake and 
its aftermath were also mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Alvarez, who has spent every night since the quake sleeping with her 
three children and her husband in the family's van outside their San Fernando 
home, said she hated to leave her sixth-grade daughter at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want her to come because I was scared something was going to 
happen," Alvarez said. "But I don't want her to miss more school." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the classrooms, which were stocked with bottled drinking water, 
counselors took turns encouraging children to express their fears about the 
quake by talking to one another and drawing pictures of their experience. 
Teachers led earthquake drills and emphasized lessons on the science of a 
temblor and the unpredictable power of Mother Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodolfo Vega, one of three counselors making the rounds at Vaughn Monday, held 
a teddy bear as he introduced himself to a classroom of fifth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all scared," Vega said. "It's OK to be nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Several children stood and shared -- some in elaborate detail -- what happened 
to their homes, their families and their lives when the quake hit. Others 
listened, not uttering a word. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the challenges the schools already face -- calming the 
children's fears, assisting those rendered homeless by the quake and repairing 
damaged buildings -- absorbing students displaced by closed schools will 
present some administrators with yet another test. "We can do it if we have 
to," said Vaughn Principal Yvonne Chan, who calculated that the school could 
accommodate nearly 100 additional students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to be strong enough to stand up to whatever happens."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; COMMUTERS BACK TO WORK; SIMI WATER DECLARED 
SAFE; RECOVERY: A WEEK AFTER THE QUAKE, PROGRESS TOWARD NORMALCY GAINS 
MOMENTUM. YET THOUSANDS MORE VISIT DISASTER RELIEF CENTERS.

 Commuters returned to work and Simi Valley's water was declared safe to drink 
Monday as Ventura County lurched back toward normalcy a week after the huge 
Northridge earthquake staggered the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridership was 15% higher than usual on the county's Metrolink trains to 
Downtown Los Angeles, and car-pools were so popular that some commuters said 
their drives were smoother than before the 6.6-magnitude quake struck last 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep looking for heavier traffic every morning, and we just haven't seen 
it," said Thousand Oaks resident Rita Romano, whose 5:45 a.m. van-pool commute 
to Los Angeles took only 35 minutes. The evening rush-hour return took the 
usual 60 minutes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a similar Downtown destination, Frank Valdez of Simi Valley said his 
12-person van reached work in 70 minutes despite a 12-mile detour around a 
fallen portion of the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our commute was just like normal except for the detour," Valdez said. "My 
wife rides the Metrolink to Burbank, and she said the trains were full." 
</P>
<P>
 But evening commutes were not hassle-free, since Metrolink trains bound for 
Ventura County were bulging for most of the trip with San Fernando Valley 
residents determined to avoid the snarls created by portions of closed freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ride in was pleasant, the ride back was not," said Dave Koch of Simi 
Valley. He said he arrived at the Burbank Metrolink station at 4 p.m., waited 
for an hour as security police held back anxious boarders, and finally arrived 
home at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Some commuters also reported evening tie-ups at the junction of the Moorpark 
and Ventura freeways in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about 2,000 more quake victims streamed to federal disaster relief 
offices in Simi Valley and Fillmore to fill out applications or make 
appointments to meet with aid workers. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,700 quake victims have visited the centers since Thursday, including a 
small percentage who have come to Simi Valley from Los Angeles County because 
of the shorter processing time, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid officials said lines moved more quickly Monday because there were more 
relief workers on the job and a shorter application form is being used in 
response to complaints about delays. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several developments around a still-jittery Ventura County were promising 
Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Simi Valley officials were notified by state health officials that residents 
can drink their tap water without boiling it first. But supplies depleted by 
pipeline breaks remained low, and outdoor watering was prohibited until further 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
 * The federal government and the Red Cross mailed hundreds of checks and 
vouchers to Ventura County quake victims for emergency housing after several 
frustrating days of delays. The first checks were issued Sunday, with Federal 
Emergency Management Agency officials saying that 100 to 200 checks were mailed 
to Ventura County applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross officials in Fillmore said they had paid two to three months' rent 
for 100 families in Fillmore, but only a few of the 140 families that received 
Red Cross food and clothing in Simi Valley requested emergency housing. 
</P>
<P>
 * State agencies that regulate mobile home parks agreed to waive a $120 
inspection fee for coaches damaged during the quake. Between 500 and 600 
coaches have been red-tagged as being too damaged to enter in Simi Valley and 
117 in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura County and Thousand Oaks were preparing emergency ordinances for 
meetings Tuesday to provide earthquake relief, including waiving fees for 
rebuilding. The Simi Valley city manager made a similar move last week, and 
ratification is expected by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the mood at disaster centers in the San Fernando Valley, good spirits 
and good deeds continued to characterize federal and Red Cross aid centers in 
Fillmore and Simi Valley, aid workers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi, for example, child psychologist and Red Cross volunteer Judy Welch 
rallied young children who had lived for a week at a shelter by asking them to 
draw their old shattered homes and the new ones they are hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my house," said 12-year-old Danielle Maston as she drew. "I want to 
remember it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, individual donors and church organizations have contributed up to 
15,000 pounds of food for quake victims, said Barbara Taylor, a parishioner at 
St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church, where a federal relief center is 
located. 
</P>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks woman arrived with food after overhearing another shopper at 
an Oxnard outlet store discuss the needs of earthquake victims, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had never been to Fillmore before, but she followed this woman with her 
truck loaded with food and ended up spending the day volunteering," Taylor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Southern Baptist group from Missouri also showed up at a Red Cross center at 
Fillmore Middle School Sunday and began serving three meals a day to 400 quake 
victims. For lunch they cooked chili in large metal vats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do this all the time. We're happy to help," said Gary Morrow, a plumber. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Fillmore Middle School students -- Anthony Camarillo, Lupe Flores and 
Frank Venegas -- were lauded by their principal for volunteering to sleep 
outside on mats next to donated food to chase away thieves who threatened the 
Red Cross food supplies Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank, 14, continues to stand guard "because we need to save the people," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While efforts to aid earthquake victims continued, local officials continued 
to tally their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 With inspections completed in Fillmore, officials said 517 buildings sustained 
moderate or severe damage, including 198 red-tagged as extremely dangerous. Of 
the most seriously damaged, 117 are mobile homes, 53 are other types of 
residences and 28 are businesses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, more that 1,100 damaged buildings had been inspected by Sunday 
evening, and officials said the tally of structures with moderate or severe 
damage rose from 376 on Saturday to 482 Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that, 417 had moderate damage and their safety was questionable. 
Sixty-seven were red-tagged. Inspectors have yet to reach at least 2,000 
buildings that owners have reported as being significantly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 500 and 600 severely damaged mobile homes are not included in the city 
tally because a state agency has jurisdiction over them. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday brought a breakthrough of sorts for mobile-home owners. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) said that Gov. Pete Wilson told her 
over the weekend that he would agree to waive the $120 state inspection fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor agreed with me that charging this kind of money is crazy when 
we're talking about elderly people in mobile homes," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright is hoping to speed the process by getting inspectors to open temporary 
offices in Simi Valley and Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Two such offices opened in Los Angeles County today, but none have been 
arranged for Ventura County, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My office is trying to get ahold of one of the mobile units," Wright said. 
"We'd like to get it going as fast as possible."

TRIAL BEGINS FOR SIMI PRIEST CHARGED WITH EMBEZZLEMENT; CRIME: POLICE TESTIFY 
ABOUT ARRESTING FATHER DAVID PIROLI 20 MONTHS AGO. THEY FOUND CASH, COCAINE AND 
COLLECTION ENVELOPES IN HIS CHURCH CAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley priest accused of embezzling $60,000 from two Ventura County 
churches went on trial Monday, nearly 20 months after police found him in his 
church car surrounded by cash, collection envelopes and cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 His clerical collar straight and gaze steady, Father David Dean Piroli 
listened attentively as Hollywood patrol officers described the arrest to a 
jury of 10 men and two women. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 29, 1992, Los Angeles Police Department officers found Piroli as he 
drove a man named Israel Palacios across the parking lot of the Sears store on 
Santa Monica Boulevard, testified Officer Ignacio Verduzco of the Hollywood 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 A large amount of money was sticking out from beneath the driver's side floor 
mat, and Verduzco lifted it and found more, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I questioned the defendant about the currency under the floor mat, and he 
replied that it was his -- that he had just withdrawn $500 from the bank, and 
$100 of that was in $1 bills," Verduzco testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used it to buy airline tickets and travelers' checks for Israel Palacios, 
who was going on emergency leave to visit his family in Mexico," Verduzco 
testified. Piroli said he hid the money because of the high crime rate in 
Hollywood, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also found more than $1,000 in a cardboard box under the driver's seat, 
including some in an envelope marked with the name of Sacred Heart Church, he 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The priest explained that the money was saved up from years of fees 
parishioners paid him to say special Masses, Verduzco told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli had served as assistant pastor at Sacred Heart in Saticoy for four 
years before moving in 1990 to St. Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley -- his 
assignment until church officials suspended him following his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found two matchboxes containing rock cocaine in the console between the 
seats, along with an airline ticket, travelers' checks and a brown paper bag 
filled with more cash, Verduzco testified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Verduzco said Piroli denied owning or using the cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 The priest explained, " 'It's not mine. The cocaine which was packaged in the 
matchbox, I confiscated from an individual last Thursday. The other, I have no 
idea where it came from,' " Verduzco testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Chantelle Koch testified that she searched the back seat of the 
Chevrolet Lumina, owned by St. Peter Claver Church, and found $2,046 in yet 
another paper bag. 
</P>
<P>
 In the trunk, she found a paper bag containing boxes that held still more 
cash, Koch testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Koch said she also found four folded $1 bills containing traces of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 But under cross-examination by defense attorney Richard Beada, Koch testified 
that the cocaine was found on the passenger's side of the car and Piroli was in 
the driver's seat when police stopped him. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace opened the trial by telling jurors that she 
would prove Piroli skimmed thousands of dollars from the two churches and spent 
some of it on cocaine and on his friend Palacios, upon whom he lavished the 
plane ticket and travelers' checks. 
</P>
<P>
 After police tallied $10,640 found in the church car and parishioners bailed 
Piroli out, church officials searched his room and found $47,666 in small 
bills, plus parishioners' checks worth $3,000, Peace told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace said a forensic accountant will testify that when Piroli was at Sacred 
Heart in 1986, he kept about $12,000 in three bank accounts -- an amount that 
swelled by the time of his arrest to $54,000 in nine separate accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The churches' records also will show that collections from parishioners 
dropped noticeably when Piroli was at Sacred Heart, and even more when he was 
at St. Peter Claver, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is basically what the people's evidence will show," Peace said. "That 
the defendant stole smaller amounts at Sacred Heart, that he went to St. Peter 
Claver where the pastor was not as financially astute and that he stole $50,000 
of the money there and he spent some of the money on cocaine and on Israel 
Palacios." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli fled after his arrest, but was rearrested more than a month later at 
the Mexican border in Calexico and brought to Ventura County for trial, Peace 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beada waived his right to make an opening statement to jurors until later in 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the jury left for the day, Beada laid out a theory he hoped would 
explain Piroli's swift departure from Simi Valley on June 2 or 3, a few days 
after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli feared for his safety after hearing of bad experiences suffered by a 
series of assistant pastors before him, Beada told Superior Court Judge Allan 
L. Steele. 
</P>
<P>
 One unnamed priest died in a car wreck while another, Father Steve Vecsey, was 
assaulted 10 years ago by the husband of Eileen Slavin, the church secretary, 
Beada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Beada said, Slavin is expected to testify that she let the air 
out of Piroli's tires after finding the cash in his room -- a statement with 
which prosecutor Peace agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Beada also alleged that Slavin had had an affair with head pastor Father 
McKeon, which led to Vecsey's beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached for comment Monday, McKeon denied the latest defense allegation, 
calling it "a big joke." He said the allegation of his purported affair with 
the church secretary "has been going on for years. It first started in the 
1970s, then it died down, then it came up again." 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks ago, Beada alleged in court that McKeon was actually stealing 
the church's money to spend on a gay lifestyle and planted it on Piroli because 
he feared the younger priest would expose him. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon said of these allegations, "I have no comment." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Slavin nor her husband, whose name was not mentioned, could be reached 
for comment Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace protested Beada's remarks, telling the judge: "He's just trying to dirty 
people up and confuse the jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Steele said he will let Piroli testify that he was frightened because his 
tires were deflated, but he will not let jurors hear evidence about Piroli's 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony is to continue today at 10 a.m.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; EARTHQUAKE WILL BRING METROLINK TO CAMARILLO; 
TRANSIT: THE TEMBLOR DOES WHAT CITY OFFICIALS COULDN'T DO -- SPEED THE ARRIVAL 
OF COMMUTER TRAIN SERVICE. 
</P>

<P>
 Plans to extend regular Metrolink train service to Camarillo -- a move aimed 
at easing post-earthquake commuter problems in the county -- were greeted by 
city leaders Monday as an unexpected "silver lining" to last week's disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials said they will be given between $500,000 and $900,000 in 
Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster funds to establish a passenger 
stop on Lewis Road on the city's east side. 
</P>
<P>
 Service to Camarillo could begin by the end of February, and a small station 
will be built at the site later, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, nobody wants to see disasters happen, but in this case some good 
will come of it," said Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose. "I've chatted about this very 
possibility with other people and they all said they would be inclined to ride 
the train if it made stops in Camarillo." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing Gose was Camarillo City Manager Bill Little, who said the city has 
long sought the extension of Metrolink service to the central county city. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Metrolink service was provided briefly during the Ventura County Fair 
last summer from Camarillo to Ventura and was very popular. Before the 
earthquake, however, Metrolink officials viewed a regular stop in Camarillo as 
too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've inquired about service here for some time and have always been told 
that money was tight and that we had to wait our turn," Little said. "I guess 
you could look at this and say this is one of the silver linings to come from 
the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Travis, manager of transit programs for the Ventura County Transportation 
Commission, said that Metrolink service to Camarillo will help relieve pressure 
on heavily congested, quake-hobbled Los Angeles-area freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have to work out schedules and logistics, but we are very excited 
about establishing a Metrolink stop in Camarillo," Travis said. "We believe 
that it will have a noticeable impact on reducing traffic into L.A. We see this 
as a crisis opportunity to benefit Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 Travis said that on Monday, Metrolink ridership was up 15% out of the two 
existing stations in the county, Moorpark and Simi Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 At the Lewis Road site, a small strip of asphalt running adjacent to the 
tracks is the only improvement to distinguish the location as a train stop. A 
dirt lot next to the tracks will eventually be paved for use as a parking lot. 
Other improvements at the site will include a wheelchair ramp and a station 
canopy. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we would like to see is the station up and operating as soon as possible 
in order to relieve as much traffic as we can," Travis said. "Over time, we 
will make the other improvements. The key is to get this thing running 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Camarillo city leaders in hailing the announcement was Ventura County 
Supervisor John K. Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said that while establishing a Metrolink stop in Camarillo is a start, 
he will continue to push for additional stops in Oxnard and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first priority should be to do anything that we can to help relieve the 
quake-related transportation problems," Flynn said. "But I still firmly believe 
that we need at the very least a Metrolink stop in Oxnard. It only makes sense 
-- it already has a fully developed train station there." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Peter Hidalgo, a Metrolink spokesman, transportation officials on 
Monday were studying whether federal emergency funds will be extended to pay 
for a Metrolink stop in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oxnard is still in the running," Hidalgo said. "We are just not at the point 
where we can say whether it will happen now or in the future. We'll know soon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Camarillo City Councilman Michael Morgan, establishment of service there 
means an extra measure of convenience for city residents, including himself. 
Morgan now rides the train from Moorpark to his Downtown Los Angeles office 
three days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you'll find that people who might not want to drive to Moorpark or 
Simi to catch the train will take advantage of it here," Morgan said. "I think 
it's great."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE DAMAGE FORCES 2 LARGE HIGH SCHOOLS TO 
SHARE CAMPUS; SIMI VALLEY: STUDENTS FROM SIMI AND ROYAL WILL DOUBLE UP. MOST 
YOUNGSTERS IN THE DISTRICT ARE ALREADY BACK IN CLASS. 
</P>

<P>
 While most Simi Valley students returned to school on Monday, officials were 
hurriedly mapping plans for the district's two largest high schools to 
temporarily operate under one roof beginning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley High School is not ready to reopen, so the school's 2,100 students 
will double up at 1,800-student Royal High School on split shifts until damage 
from last week's quake can be repaired, Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine other schools that were not fixed by Monday will open their doors today, 
including two of the schools hit hardest by the 6.6-magnitude temblor: Township 
Elementary and Valley View Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't look pretty, but we're safe," Township Principal Barbara Marino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Structural damage at those schools and Simi Valley High was not as bad as 
officials first feared. But at Simi Valley, workers over the weekend found 
asbestos in the ceiling tiles, requiring a special contractor to remove it, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the high school reopens, both schools will run on shortened schedules of 
six 40-minute periods, rather than 50 minutes each. Royal will be in session 
from 7 a.m. to 11:35 a.m. and Simi will start at 12:15 p.m. and run to 4:50 
p.m. Optional lunch for both schools will be from 11:40 a.m. to 12:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Information booths will be set up today in front of both schools to answer 
questions from the community, Wolford said. In addition, school and city buses 
will be available at the Simi High parking lot at 11:15 a.m. to transport 
students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get the kids back into a school schedule," Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolford said she expects to know by today how long the two schools might have 
to operate as one. The timeline depends on how quickly the asbestos is removed 
so that district maintenance workers can resume tearing out loosened stucco and 
patching cracked walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley High students were warned not to return to their lockers to get 
books or other supplies. "The campus is a restricted area," Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, officials took pains to reassure parents of children at 
Township Elementary that heavy ceiling-light fixtures that fell onto desks in 
every classroom have been reattached with special bracing to sway rather than 
detach in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're looking at one of the worst-hit schools, and it's in great shape," 
Assistant Supt. Ralph Wilson said on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Districtwide damage, initially estimated at about $5 million, has been revised 
downward to about $3 million, Wilson said. One-third of that will be spent 
fixing the badly damaged gym and multipurpose room at Simi Valley High, Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials do not know how much federal or state aid will be available to 
reimburse the district, which already faces a $2.5-million deficit for the next 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we're hoping someone will drop it out of the sky," school board 
member Judy Barry said as she watched construction at Township. "I really don't 
know where the money is going to come from." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, thousands of Simi Valley children at 17 of the district's 27 
schools returned to class on Monday for the first time since the quake hit a 
week ago. Teachers encouraged students to talk about their fears so they could 
come to grips with them. 
</P>
<P>
 From first-graders up, students wrote stories and stood up to tell tales about 
what happened at their house during the earthquake. Others drew pictures to 
represent their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 In her class at Crestview Elementary, fifth-grader Rochelle Frederiksen drew a 
picture of children hiding under their desks to illustrate how it feels to be 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 10-year-old stood up to show it to classmates, Rochelle said: "If 
there's an earthquake, I don't know where my family is, and I want to be with 
my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Christina Goodman felt differently. She shared her picture, "Happy," a design 
of bright colors. "My picture is happy because everybody in my family came out 
OK," said 10-year-old Christina. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Often just as shaken as the students arriving at school were their parents, 
said Crestview Principal Ronda Oster. Many mothers came to tour the campus 
before leaving their children in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could go right in the room and see it was OK and see the walls were 
still standing, and that helped," Oster said. "But I think the moms had a 
harder time leaving than the students had returning." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students seemed more skittish than usual, but that is to be expected, 
teachers said. Returning to a routine adds to their sense of normalcy, said 
kindergarten teacher Charlotte Kasten. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to be with their friends and they want to play, but they notice 
every crack in the ground," Kasten said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-grader Melissa Lee seemed to confirm that view. The 11-year-old was 
shaken by a minor aftershock shortly after 10 a.m. But she still was glad to be 
back at school, Melissa said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I can get life back to normal," she said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; EMERGENCY CREWS GET A BIG LIFT OVER CLOSED 
FREEWAYS; TRANSPORTATION: UP TO FOUR CHINOOK HELICOPTERS DAILY FERRY ABOUT 160 
FIREFIGHTERS AND 240 DEPUTIES INTO AND OUT OF THE HARD-HIT SANTA CLARITA 
VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cut off from the Santa Clarita Valley because of downed freeways and clogged 
roads, hundreds of additional sheriff's deputies and firefighters are being 
airlifted to duty in helicopters in what officials say is an unprecedented 
aerial effort. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past week a squadron of California Army National Guard helicopters has 
been ferrying the deputies and firefighters between Los Angeles and a landing 
zone at Magic Mountain in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 The twin-rotor Chinook helicopters, large enough to carry two pickup trucks, 
set out every morning to haul firefighters between the two areas, and then 
perform the same service later in the morning and evening for sheriff's 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation has won praise from county fire and sheriff's officials for 
providing quick and reliable transportation for the emergency crews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been going extremely well," said Sheriff Sherman R. Block, who requested 
the helicopters after realizing that ground transportation would be a problem. 
"It's certainly proven itself to be a very valuable approach to moving 
significant numbers of personnel as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Sheriff's Department often uses its smaller Sikorsky helicopters 
to move special weapons teams, and the county Fire Department has its own fleet 
of water-dropping and paramedic helicopters, officials said neither agency has 
ever before airlifted such large numbers of personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the National Guard transport helicopters can carry more than 30 
passengers, two or three times the number that the county's helicopters can 
accommodate. 
</P>
<P>
 Using up to four helicopters at a time, the airlifts have been carrying about 
160 firefighters and 240 deputies to and from work every day. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters are picked up at El Monte Airport, while the deputies are 
collected from among about half a dozen locations for the flight to Magic 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 The airlift is necessary because the Sheriff's Department has reinforced the 
Santa Clarita Valley -- the area hardest hit by the quake in its jurisdiction 
-- with about 120 extra deputies per shift. The Fire Department has beefed up 
shifts by about 80 extra people. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the Sheriff's Department typically has relied on its fleet of 
buses to move deputies in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 When assigned to remote stations in emergencies, county firefighters sometimes 
car-pool. But neither of those approaches looked appealing after last week's 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And because the Santa Clarita Valley has continued to be hit by sizable 
aftershocks, county fire and sheriff's officials are keeping their 
reinforcements assigned to the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Block said the airlifts may continue for some time unless other alternatives 
are found. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Los Angeles riots, the National Guard Chinook helicopters were sent 
from their Stockton base to Southern California, but saw little use, said 1st 
Lt. Erik Thiesmeyer, the guard's aviation liaison in Los Angeles. He said the 
craft were not called in during last year's massive wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, with sections of the Antelope Valley and Golden State 
freeways that provide access to the Santa Clarita Valley closed by earthquake 
damage, Thiesmeyer said the squadron of five Chinooks was made available last 
Tuesday, the day after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were looking at a three-hour drive each way and, when you're running on 
a 12-hour shift, you're looking at a 20-hour day," the lieutenant said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; RENTAL TRUCK AND MOVING FIRMS SCRAMBLE TO MEET

 It took U-Haul Co.'s truck rental store in Northridge a few days to get back 
in business after last week's earthquake. But as soon as the doors were opened 
Thursday, a line formed to the end of the parking lot. And the phone hasn't 
stopped ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business has increased at least tenfold," said manager Andrew Couplin. 
"I've had people yelling at us, crying, 'This is an emergency!' Well, it's an 
emergency for a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for other major rental companies and moving firms said they do not 
have statistics for the increase in business since the quake, but local 
managers said volume is extremely heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at both Ryder Trucks and U-Haul said they are bringing in several 
hundred additional trucks to meet the increased demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Most customers planned to move locally, from quake-ravaged areas such as 
Northridge to other parts of the Los Angeles Basin, moving company officials 
said. But a few left the San Fernando Valley for Ventura County, elsewhere in 
California or to other states. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been very busy and hectic," said Scott Brontsema, manager for U-Haul 
in Canyon Country in the Santa Clarita Valley. "I have a waiting list for 
trucks with 70 names on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people, Brontsema said, have failed to return trucks, causing him to 
speculate that they may be living in them. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers from Santa Monica-based Western Moving & Storage have been moving two 
or three families daily since the earthquake, said company President John 
Black. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been running on maximum capacity," Black said. "We had every truck 
that we had out in the area, doing local moving or helping offices move out. It 
is such a huge increase, I can't even put it at a percentage." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's Chatsworth office was slightly damaged but remained open, with 
trucks sent from an office in Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to move people out before the rains catch us," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lym Tecson said she rented a Ryder truck in Northridge to move from her Reseda 
apartment to a house in Oxnard. "I was really scared (by the quake)," she said. 
"I thought I was going to get crushed. I just want out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 At the U-Haul truck rental lot in Northridge, one of the areas hit hardest by 
Monday's quake, local residents waited in line Sunday for a chance to move 
their belongings out of the San Fernando Valley and into homes or garages of 
friends and relatives. To get trucks to as many people as possible, managers at 
the store limited the time customers could keep a truck to six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we got the last (truck)," said Lyle Kurtz, 31, a doctor from Sherman 
Oaks who was moving to his brother-in-law's house in West Los Angeles. "Our 
building is not in good shape, and I need to get my valuables out." 
</P>
<P>
 U-Haul officials spent much of the weekend coordinating the arrival of trucks 
from throughout Southern California to areas hit hardest by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 For trucks bound into Los Angeles, the company offered the cargo space to 
relief agencies such as the Red Cross. The agencies filled them in places such 
as San Diego and Riverside with goods for quake victims, and brought them to 
the Valley and other stricken areas. Once here, the trucks were emptied and 
then rented out. 
</P>
<P>
 For some quake victims, however, success in renting a truck or hiring movers 
did not mean that precious belongings were saved. A spokesman for El Segundo's 
A Gentle Giant Moving Co. said movers must consider their own safety before 
agreeing to work in dangerous areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy scheduled a move with us and went crazy when we wouldn't enter a 
red-tagged (condemned) building," the spokesman said. "It's sad he's losing his 
belongings, but it's not worth anybody's safety." 
</P>
<P>
 The worst situation, said Steve Boross, an operations manager for Diversified 
Moving/Allied Van Lines in Chatsworth, is having no trucks available and being 
unable to suggest an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they call, crying, and I can't even refer them anywhere because the 
whole industry is maxed out," he said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; MAN CHARGED WITH THEFT OF COMPUTER FILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County prosecutor on Monday asked a jury to convict a former 
maintenance supervisor at Camarillo-based Siemens Solar Industries of stealing 
confidential computer files from the company. 
</P>
<P>
 George Stockhausen, 46, is charged with burglary and unlawful access of a 
computer. He faces up to three years in state prison on each count. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 27, a Siemens security guard saw Stockhausen, 46, illegally 
downloading computer files in the company's legal office, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Donna W. Thonis told the Superior Court jury Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 She played a tape-recorded interview in which Stockhausen admitted to Siemens' 
private investigators that he entered the locked office from a rooftop and 
copied some computer files. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglary of the legal office occurred hours after Siemens filed a lawsuit 
against Atlantic Richfield Co. alleging that Arco had failed to disclose 
problems at its Arco Solar plant before selling it to Siemens in 1989. Siemens 
attorney Dana Chambliss said the burglary may have been intended to get 
information about the suit.  
</P>
<P>
 But Stockhausen, who was fired, said he was just trying to get information on 
another Siemens employee rumored to have failed a drug test, according to the 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambliss testified that she had warned Stockhausen and other Siemens 
employees against entering the private legal office. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Thonis told the jury that Stockhausen should be convicted 
regardless of his intent because it is illegal to copy computer files without 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Thonis has not implicated Arco in the burglary. Atlantic Richfield officials 
have denied charges in the civil lawsuit but could not be reached Monday for 
comment on the Stockhausen case. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief, one-minute opening statement, defense attorney Kenneth B. Frank 
said Stockhausen "was operating in the scope of his duty" when he copied the 
files, which Stockhausen said he later discarded on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is expected to go to the jury in Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr.'s 
courtroom this morning. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; SCHOOL BOARD TO HEAR OPPOSITION TO BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark school board member Tom Baldwin tonight will seek the support of his 
fellow board members in an ongoing battle to remove "The Clan of the Cave Bear" 
and other works by popular novelist Jean Auel from a recommended high school 
reading list. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin has for more than a year been pressing to have four Auel works taken 
off the 11th-grade reading list because of concerns over their explicit sexual 
content. 
</P>
<P>
 The board member's crusade against the books has already failed to find favor 
with a high school committee, a district advisory panel and Supt. Tom Duffy. 
Baldwin said that if his colleagues on the board also reject his appeal, he 
will accept the decision and drop the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that the school board is the place to make this decision," 
Baldwin said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, Baldwin could appeal an unfavorable board ruling to the county 
Board of Education. The district could similarly appeal a decision by the board 
to remove the books from the list. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will consider the matter at its 7 p.m. meeting in the Moorpark 
Community Center, 799 Moorpark Ave. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; KRISHNAMURTI LAND DEAL TO BE REVIEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deal that would spare 72 acres from development but allow 12 to 15 homes on 
neighboring property will be reviewed tonight by the Ojai City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was submitted by the Krishnamurti Foundation of America, a charitable 
trust that spreads the writings and teachings of its philosopher founder, J. 
Krishnamurti. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation owns about 150 acres just west of the city, some of which is 
slated for eventual annexation. Under the plan, the trust would give 
development rights to the 72-acre parcel just north of California 33 to the 
city of Ojai or the Ojai Land Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the promise to keep the acreage as open space, however, the 
foundation would receive zoning concessions that would allow housing units on a 
neighboring 25-acre lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan has drawn criticism from many residents, who feel that all the land 
should remain undeveloped. Nearly a dozen speakers opposed the deal at a 
Planning Commission meeting in November. 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrew Stasse, a consultant retained by the foundation, said the proposal 
is a good deal for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Stasse said that under current zoning, his clients could develop 25% of both 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the Krishnamurti Foundation of America wants to do is develop a plan 
that has environmental integrity but also retains the value of the land," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the issue is a statewide bond measure on the June ballot that 
would set aside almost $2 billion for parkland acquisition and restoration. If 
the bond issue wins approval, Ojai could receive as much as $3 million that 
could be used to buy the Krishnamurti land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to wait until after June to make any decisions and hope for the best 
for the initiative," Mayor Steve Olsen said. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNCIL TO NAME NEW PLANNING BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council today will name a new Planning Commission, weeks after 
voting to eliminate two positions and restructure the terms of its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an ordinance adopted last month, members of the Oxnard Planning 
Commission will be selected by individual council members.The number of 
commissioners was cut from seven to five. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission is an advisory panel that forwards land-use and other 
planning recommendations to the City Council. Its members must be registered 
voters and live within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Each appointee also must be approved by the remainder of the City Council and 
will serve on the advisory panel for the balance of the term of the council 
member who made the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine people have applied for appointment to the Planning Commission, including 
incumbent commissioners Albert G. Duff, Dean Dale, Edward Castillo, Arthur J. 
Lopez and Ralph C. Schumacher. The other applicants are James J. Connor, Robert 
C. Moore, Fred Schwartz and Ray C. Tafoya. 
</P>
<P>
 Two commissioners, Edward Flores and Victor Fontaine, declined to seek 
reappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision late last year to restructure the terms and conditions of 
appointments to the Planning Commission and other advisory panels was 
criticized by Flores and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores quit his position in disgust, saying the City Council had stripped the 
panel of what little authority it had. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; MISSING MAN, 74, IS FOUND SAFE IN TRUCK 
</P>

<P>
 A 74-year-old Camarillo man who had been missing since Friday was found 
sitting in his pickup truck in Santa Clarita and has been returned home, the 
man's wife reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Corsetti was reported missing after he left his Camarillo home about 3:30 
p.m. Friday to get gasoline, authorities said.Corsetti is at times forgetful 
and can be disoriented, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Corsetti said she received a call from a Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputy Sunday night, reporting that her husband was healthy and safe at a 
sheriff's station in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Angeles County authorities became involved when a clerk in a Santa Clarita 
mini-mall spotted Corsetti sitting in his truck in the parking lot for an 
unusual length of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he just got disoriented," Dorothy Corsetti said. "He never had any 
connections in Santa Clarita. He must have gotten on the 126 and kept driving." 
A Ventura County sheriff's deputy confirmed his safe return. "He's home and 
happy and healthy," said Senior Deputy Joe Evans. "He's a delightful man."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; TEXTILE PLANT OWNERS ADMIT TO POLLUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The operators of a defunct textile manufacturing plant in Simi Valley have 
pleaded guilty to two felony charges related to the discharge of hazardous 
pollutants from their Easy Street plant, which closed in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Virgil Bates, 54, and Kenneth Arthur Baber, 46, entered their pleas in 
federal court Jan. 18 and will be sentenced April 4, said Marc Harris, 
assistant U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates faces 10 to 16 months in prison and Baber six to 12 months. Their former 
company, Melody Knitting Mills, has agreed to pay $45,000 in fines and 
restitution to the Simi Valley County Sanitation District for violating the 
federal Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency became involved in the case against Bates 
and Baber in 1988, after the city of Simi Valley had made repeated attempts to 
reduce the hazardous flow from the plant where textiles were dyed and printed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simi Valley went to such great lengths to try and get these people to come 
into compliance and they basically thumbed their noses at the local 
authorities," Harris said. The company continued to allow solvents, chlorine 
and acidic fluids to flow into their waste water even after the EPA ordered it 
to stop in 1988, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Melody Knitting Mills, also known as Travelin' West Textiles, discharged 
between 200,000 and 500,000 gallons of waste water per day before the company 
closed in January, 1989. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

 The Ventura County Crime Stoppers program is offering two rewards of up to 
$1,000 each for information that helps apprehend thieves in a rash of car 
burglaries and a bird heist at a pet store. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Jan. 1, five cars have been broken into and looted at night in the 
Campus Park area of Moorpark, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Items stolen include cellular phones, jewelry, stereo equipment and a purse, 
police said. A resident said he chased off a Latino male with close-cropped 
hair during one incident, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second case, burglars pried open the door of Furs N Feathers Pet Store 
in Thousand Oaks on Jan. 15, police said. The burglars got away with three 
parrots and a cage worth a total of $1,750, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the parrots were green with gold chest feathers, police said. One of 
them can say "pretty bird" and "meow." The other green bird does not talk. 
</P>
<P>
 The third parrot, an African gray, says "hi, Zack," "hello" and cries "ouch" 
when he falls down, police said. This bird bites any woman who tries to pick it 
up. Also taken was a 4 1/2-foot wrought-iron cage, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information should call 494-TALK. Callers may remain anonymous, 
police said. BRENDA DAY

MAN IS ARRESTED IN LICENSE PLATE THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's investigators said they have arrested a man suspected 
of stealing license plates from cars at the Wilbur Oaks Apartments in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said they arrested 34-year-old Robert Michael Greene Monday after 
finding 110 license plates and street signs in his Wilbur Oaks apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a tip, the detectives said they searched Greene's apartment and 
found the plates, which were packed in a box. Greene offered deputies no 
explanation as to why he had them, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene was booked into the Ventura County Jail for possession of stolen 
property, deputies said. His bail was set at $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies had been receiving reports of stolen plates since Thanksgiving, said 
Sgt. Ken Warren. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have had 12 in one night," Warren said. "And they're not vanity 
plates, they're any plate." 
</P>
<P>
 Desiree Biesterfeld, a Wilbur Oaks resident whose license plate was stolen in 
December, said she met a deputy one night at the apartment complex who looked 
weary from responding to calls there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a policeman and he said, 'I've been out here so many times,' " she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were unsure just how many people had reported their plates stolen, 
and suspected that many hadn't. Warren said the plates would probably be 
destroyed because most of the victims had re-registered their vehicles. "These 
will be taken off the computer and dumped," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Biesterfeld said the theft was mainly an inconvenience, costing her time and 
$8 to re-register her car. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some weird people out there," she said of the odd crime. "Nothing 
surprises me anymore." TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CHASE ENDS AS STOLEN VEHICLE RAMS TREE 
</P>

<P>
 An Oxnard man driving a stolen utility vehicle led Ventura County sheriff's 
deputies on a wild chase between Camarillo and Moorpark on Monday, which ended 
when he crashed the vehicle in an orchard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrested Robert Ramirez, 20, on suspicion of auto theft after Ramirez 
rammed the vehicle into a tree and attempted to flee on foot, said Sgt. Ken 
Cozzens.The chase began shortly after 2 p.m. when deputies received a call from 
a witness who saw a green Chevy Suburban with torn ignition wires leaving a gas 
station in the 600 block of Las Posas Road in Camarillo. The vehicle had been 
stolen from a private residence in Oxnard, Cozzens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies found Ramirez driving the Suburban on Lewis Road in Somis, Cozzens 
said. When the driver saw the deputies, he took off heading east on California 
118, Cozzens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two deputies' cars followed the Suburban to Moorpark, where three sheriff's 
units and a helicopter joined in the pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez then fled the Moorpark area and headed back to Somis, traveling west 
on Broadway. Cozzens said the 15-minute chase ended when Ramirez crashed the 
Suburban into an orange tree in the area of Stockton Road and Broadway while 
attempting to maneuver a tight turn at high speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez then leaped out of the vehicle and ran into the orange orchard, where 
he was apprehended on foot by Deputy Bill Schierman, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez was not injured in the crash. TRACY WILSON

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DISTRICT ATTORNEY SEEKS NEW LAW TO HALT PRICE 
GOUGING; AFTERMATH: ABOUT A DOZEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED ABOUT COUNTY BUSINESSES 
RAISING PRICES OF FOOD, GAS AND OTHER SUPPLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Taking steps to limit price gouging after last week's earthquake, the Ventura 
County district attorney's office will ask the county supervisors today to 
adopt an ordinance making it a crime to inflate prices in the wake of a 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 quake, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's office received 
about a dozen complaints about county businesses raising prices of food, gas, 
lumber and plumbing supplies, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the free-market concept envisioned that you would be able to 
charge someone $8 for a gallon of milk just because their home has been 
destroyed," said Colleen Toy White, the county's chief assistant district 
attorney. "We are convinced here in our office we do need a strong ordinance to 
prevent this for future (disasters). 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just unconscionable conduct for those who would take advantage of these 
types of disasters." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury will also ask the board at its meeting today to push for state 
legislation to outlaw price-gouging throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 "As public officials, it is incumbent that we take all necessary steps to 
protect Ventura County citizens from excessive and unjustified increases in 
prices charged for goods and services vital to their health and welfare," 
Bradbury wrote in a letter to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Vicky Howard, Maria VanderKolk, John K. Flynn and Maggie Kildee 
agreed that the county should take steps to protect residents from 
opportunists. Supervisor Susan K. Lacey could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are very few of them out there, but I think it's outrageous 
that they would take advantage of someone's misery during this type of 
disaster," Howard said. "I heard of one company that was charging $1,300 to 
install a water tank. We've heard of people gouging on rents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is something we can do about this with a countywide ordinance, I'm 
absolutely 100% in agreement with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn added: "It's a terrible crime against society . . . especially against 
people who are desperate. If it's going on, it should be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 White said the district attorney office's Consumer and Environmental 
Protection Division began receiving complaints almost immediately after the 
disaster from residents who felt they had been victimized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got about 10 reports within the first few days," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the reports were complaints that one hardware store, located just over 
the Los Angeles County line, was selling an $8 piece of plywood for $200. 
Another caller reported that a gas station in Thousand Oaks had marked up gas 
by 20%, White said. And yet another resident said one east county store was 
selling milk for $8 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had people calling us asking for some sort of assistance in this," White 
said. "There was nothing we could do except sympathize with them and indicate 
we would seek some sort of ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely frustrating when you have people who were already victimized 
by a natural disaster, then they are victimized again by someone in the corner 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 If the supervisors adopt the ordinance as an emergency measure, it could go 
into effect immediately, White said. Offenders could face fines for violations, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would suggest that we at least have a significant fine," White said. "You 
would at least have to take the profit out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 County counsel was still working out details of the ordinance late Monday and 
was expected to have a definition of what would be considered gouging in time 
for today's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 White said the city of Los Angeles and several states have adopted ordinances 
against price gouging of emergency supplies, food, water and other consumer 
goods necessary for the health and safety of citizens.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; HIGH SCHOOLS TO SHARE CAMPUS DUE TO QUAKE; SIMI 
VALLEY: STUDENTS FROM SIMI AND ROYAL WILL DOUBLE UP. MOST YOUNGSTERS IN THE 
DISTRICT ARE ALREADY BACK IN CLASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While most Simi Valley students returned to school on Monday, officials were 
hurriedly mapping plans for the district's two largest high schools to 
temporarily operate under one roof beginning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley High School is not ready to reopen, so the school's 2,100 students 
will double up at 1,800-student Royal High School on split shifts until damage 
from last week's quake can be repaired, Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine other schools that were not fixed by Monday will open their doors today, 
including two of the schools hit hardest by the 6.6-magnitude temblor: Township 
Elementary and Valley View Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't look pretty, but we're safe," Township Principal Barbara Marino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Structural damage at those schools and Simi Valley High was not as bad as 
officials first feared. But at Simi Valley, workers over the weekend found 
asbestos in the ceiling tiles, requiring a special contractor to remove it, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the high school reopens, both schools will run on shortened schedules of 
six 40-minute periods, rather than 50 minutes each. Royal will be in session 
from 7 a.m. to 11:35 a.m. and Simi will start at 12:15 p.m. and run to 4:50 
p.m. Optional lunch for both schools will be from 11:40 a.m. to 12:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Information booths will be set up today in front of both schools to answer 
questions from the community, Wolford said. In addition, school and city buses 
will be available at the Simi High parking lot at 11:15 a.m. to transport 
students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get the kids back into a school schedule," Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolford said she expects to know by today how long the two schools might have 
to operate as one. The timeline depends on how quickly the asbestos is removed 
so that district maintenance workers can resume tearing out loosened stucco and 
patching cracked walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley High students were warned not to return to their lockers to get 
books or other supplies. "The campus is a restricted area," Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, officials took pains to reassure parents of children at 
Township Elementary that heavy ceiling-light fixtures that fell onto desks in 
every classroom have been reattached with special bracing to sway rather than 
detach in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're looking at one of the worst-hit schools, and it's in great shape," 
Assistant Supt. Ralph Wilson said on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Districtwide damage, initially estimated at about $5 million, has been revised 
downward to about $3 million, Wilson said. One-third of that will be spent 
fixing the badly damaged gym and multipurpose room at Simi Valley High, Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials do not know how much federal or state aid will be available to 
reimburse the district, which already faces a $2.5-million deficit for the next 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we're hoping someone will drop it out of the sky," school board 
member Judy Barry said as she watched construction at Township. "I really don't 
know where the money is going to come from." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, thousands of Simi Valley children at 17 of the district's 27 
schools returned to class on Monday for the first time since the quake hit a 
week ago. Teachers encouraged students to talk about their fears so they could 
come to grips with them. 
</P>
<P>
 From first-graders up, students wrote stories and stood up to tell tales about 
what happened at their house during the earthquake. Others drew pictures to 
represent their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 In her class at Crestview Elementary, fifth-grader Rochelle Frederiksen drew a 
picture of children hiding under their desks to illustrate how it feels to be 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 10-year-old stood up to show it to classmates, Rochelle said: "If 
there's an earthquake, I don't know where my family is, and I want to be with 
my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Christina Goodman felt differently. She shared her picture, "Happy," a design 
of bright colors. "My picture is happy because everybody in my family came out 
OK," said 10-year-old Christina. 
</P>
<P>
 Often just as shaken as the students arriving at school were their parents, 
said Crestview Principal Ronda Oster. Many mothers came to tour the campus 
before leaving their children in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could go right in the room and see it was OK and see the walls were 
still standing, and that helped," Oster said. "But I think the moms had a 
harder time leaving than the students had returning." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students seemed more skittish than usual, but that is to be expected, 
teachers said. Returning to a routine adds to their sense of normalcy, said 
kindergarten teacher Charlotte Kasten. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to be with their friends and they want to play, but they notice 
every crack in the ground," Kasten said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-grader Melissa Lee seemed to confirm that view. The 11-year-old was 
shaken by a minor aftershock shortly after 10 a.m. But she still was glad to be 
back at school, Melissa said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I can get life back to normal," she said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SURVIVORS TOLD TO GET IN AND GET OUT -- FAST; 
DISASTER: FORMER RESIDENTS OF NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS ARE ESCORTED INTO SMASHED 
APARTMENTS TO GRAB WHAT THEY CAN AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN.

<P>
 Breathless from the mad dash up three flights of stairs, Beverly Reading held 
on to her hard hat Monday and burst into Apartment 333 at Northridge Meadows. 
It was dark, it was creaky, and the cloying stench of rotting food filled the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reading, 58, wasn't looking for the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. 
She was searching for her clowns. 
</P>
<P>
 She had just 15 minutes to clear out a place that had been home for two years 
-- until the 6.6-magnitude Northridge earthquake knocked her out of bed and 
tossed her worldly possessions into an unholy mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading made a beeline for the clowns, then headed toward the dining room. 
From there, she moved to the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be a clown collector and I bet they're all gone," she said. Indeed, 
a headless harlequin lay among the shards of glass, scattered books and broken 
furniture. But another clown was intact, and Reading stashed it under her arm. 
The Emmett Kelly prints, too cumbersome to carry, remained behind. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a scene reminiscent of a supermarket sweep in hell, repeated Monday in 
the 40 apartments deemed safest to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading worked from a mental list of things she wanted to retrieve most, if 
she got the chance. The instructions to her daughter, Lee Edwards, were clear: 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's my typewriter. And these chairs. I want to look for that book. I want 
my phone book. . . . My kids' pictures are under here. And my pictures of my 
parents and my brother. I want their pictures. I don't have my parents' 
picture. It must be under there," she said, pointing to a pile of papers by the 
sofa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my God, mother. You have too much stuff," Edwards groaned. 
</P>
<P>
 In small groups, each accompanied by an inspector with the city's Department 
of Building and Safety, dozens of former residents returned to the scene of the 
temblor's highest death toll to salvage their belongings. Makeshift wooden 
ramps allowed them access from an alleyway through a break in a wall. Survivors 
piled their belongings, making mini-encampments in the alley before loading 
them into pickups and utility vehicles. Meanwhile, a crane plucked cars from 
the collapsed parking structure at the west end of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 They were spared aftershocks as they entered the building that has sagged 
lower each day since Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, a resident paused to remember a neighbor who didn't make it out, 
to wipe away a tear. But Monday was a day for fast and furious work. 
</P>
<P>
 The building inspectors were put to use as laborers, carrying armloads of 
possessions such as microwaves, television sets -- and even stuffed animals -- 
from the apartments of the residents they accompanied inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to organize an orderly withdrawal," building inspector Jim Ashby 
said. "We don't know when more aftershocks are going to come. A lot of these 
exits aren't safe. They could run off the end of the building and be gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the salvaging occurred on the north side, which building inspectors 
said was the most stable and accessible section. Later, they will shore up 
other sections so other residents can retrieve their belongings, said senior 
building inspector Ronald Black. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, we're alive. A lot of people aren't. We are the lucky ones," Reading 
acknowledged. "I rented my apartment because of the color of the kitchen sink. 
I could have rented one in the front, where it collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Saturday, angry survivors had pressured city officials and the 
building's owners to let them return. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, someone has left flowers along Reseda Boulevard, in front of the 
apartments where many of the victims died. The makeshift memorial grows daily, 
according to a National Guard soldier assigned to patrol the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, building inspectors were gleaning the first clues to why the 
complex at 9565 Reseda Blvd. collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Harder, chief of the plan check division at the Van Nuys office of the 
Department of Building and Safety, said that based on preliminary 
investigations the collapse of the Northridge Meadows Apartments can be 
attributed mostly to the lack of plywood in the building's walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that the lack of plywood was a major contributor" to the 
collapse, he said. But the builders have disputed that finding. 
</P>
<P>
 Harder said plywood in the walls provides for lateral support and helps keep 
buildings from shifting and collapsing during a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Harder said his conclusion was based on inspections of the collapsed building 
and on a study of blueprints for an adjacent apartment building that was 
designed and built by the same engineer and contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harder added that the engineer and contractor on the building most likely 
followed the building codes that were in place in 1971 when the city issued a 
permit to build the Northridge Meadows Apartments. Those codes were upgraded 
after the 1971 Sylmar quake to require stronger reinforcement in the walls and 
ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment complex was built on support beams over ground-level carports 
and, therefore, received less support than would a complex built over a more 
traditional underground garage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week, Brian Heller, whose company built the apartment 
complex, said he was searching for the blueprints to investigate for himself 
what may have caused the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Heller disputed reports that his company did not use plywood to support the 
walls. "My recollection is that we used some plywood in the shear walls," he 
said, referring to the building's support walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Heller added that his company built other structures throughout the San 
Fernando Valley that did not collapse in Monday's earthquake.

CHANGES URGED TO KEEP THOUSAND OAKS JUST THE SAME; DEVELOPMENT: CITY COMMISSION 
DEVISES SCORES OF GENERAL PLAN REVISIONS TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO IN A 
COMMUNITY THAT LIKES ITS HORSES AND ITS HILLSIDES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After two years of town meetings and citizen surveys, Thousand Oaks Mayor 
Elois Zeanah says she has heard one message loud and clear: Most residents like 
their city just fine, and they want to preserve it pretty much as is. 
</P>
<P>
 They want to keep their hillsides empty and their skylines crisp, she says. 
They want to keep their buildings short and their neighborhoods quiet. They 
want to keep their horses at home and their bicycles on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 And they want the city to retain its peaceful, semirural atmosphere well into 
the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve that goal, a four-member city committee has recommended scores of 
revisions to the city's General Plan, a blueprint for future development. The 
group -- including Zeanah, Councilwoman Judy Lazar and Planning Commissioners 
Irving Wasserman and Marilyn Carpenter -- will present suggestions at a study 
session tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have reached a community consensus as to the vision of what our city will 
look like 20 years from now, at build-out," Zeanah said. "If adopted by the 
council, these recommendations should eliminate a lot of controversial 
hearings" about future development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The committee was set up two years ago to overhaul the General Plan. Among its 
recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
 * Change the zoning on both the Raznick and Cohan properties in Newbury Park 
to allow only low- and medium-density residential construction, no more than 
seven units per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 * Designate Fireworks Hill, a 27-acre parcel behind the former City Hall on 
Hillcrest Drive, as a "protected ridgeline" to prevent future development from 
marring the skyline. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reaffirm the 35-foot height restrictions and extensive landscaping 
requirements for the vacant parcels at the intersection of Westlake and 
Thousand Oaks boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Study whether Lynn Road, Wendy Drive and Old Conejo Road need to be widened 
-- and if so, figure out how to achieve better traffic flow and build new bike 
paths without affecting nearby trees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preserve the equestrian community by retaining zoning for ranch-style homes 
with horse stables.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not compiling recommendations that will sit in a file cabinet 
somewhere," Wasserman said. "These will become absolute action items." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite Wasserman's optimism, several council members have already 
signaled their distaste for at least a few recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Alex Fiore and Frank Schillo oppose the "protected ridgeline" zone 
for Fireworks Hill, for example, because they believe such a move would deny 
the property owner a fair use of the parcel. Instead, they suggested that the 
city purchase the land and keep it pristine. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo noted, however, that the city may not have the funds to buy Fireworks 
Hill -- or to carry out other recommendations, like widening certain streets 
and building more trails and bike paths. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be interesting to see where we're going to get the money for all these 
ideas in the General Plan," Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just holding the public hearings required to adopt all the recommendations 
could cost the city roughly $25,000. Despite the expense, committee members 
said it was crucial to update the General Plan, which has not been overhauled 
in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of concern about ensuring that the community looks and develops 
the way it was originally intended," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, she cited traffic circulation issues. The committee recommended 
improving several congested intersections, including the Ventura Freeway 
interchanges at Hampshire Road, Wendy Drive and Westlake Boulevard. But they 
stopped short of recommending drastic public-works improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had to remove landscaping or affect oak trees, the community indicated 
they would take a lesser level of service," Lazar said. "They want to preserve 
the amenities. If it takes a little longer to get through, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 After tonight's study session, the City Council will send the proposed General 
Plan revisions to the Planning Commission for discussion and endorsement. The 
council will then formally consider adopting the document. Each specific zone 
change will require a separate public hearing.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; LAWYERS WARN OF QUAKE-DAMAGED ROUTE TO NEW SITE 
OF CHILD HEARINGS; COURTS: BAR GROUP IS CONSIDERING A LAWSUIT AGAINST A JUDGE'S 
DECISION TO MOVE DEPENDENCY CASES FROM LANCASTER TO MONTEREY PARK. 
</P>

<P>
 Antelope Valley parents may soon have to make a 70- to 80-mile trek over an 
earthquake-damaged route to attend critical child dependency hearings in 
Monterey Park, local attorneys warned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Antelope Valley Dependency Attorneys Bar Assn. said they are 
considering a lawsuit to challenge Los Angeles County Juvenile Court Presiding 
Judge Marcus Tucker's recent decision to move hearings from Lancaster to 
distant Monterey Park. The judge said he made the decision to relocate the 
cases because of overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the earthquake, Tucker has delayed the transfer order for now, but 
Antelope Valley attorneys fear that the reprieve is only temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe there's a viable federal class-action lawsuit that can be filed," 
said Hans F. Berg, president of the local association, made up of attorneys who 
handle cases in which children are removed from their home, often amid 
allegations of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg said he believes that parents are being denied their legal rights when 
key hearings are held at a court they cannot easily reach. Monterey Park, at 
the western edge of the San Gabriel Valley, is south of Pasadena and east of 
Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Berg at a news conference Monday were the mayors of Lancaster and 
Palmdale, representatives of social service groups such as United Way and an 
aide to Assemblyman William J. (Pete) Knight (R-Palmdale). 
</P>
<P>
 Local attorneys said the drive to Monterey Park, if the parents had a car, 
took at least two hours before the earthquake. They estimated that it will take 
twice as long now. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Knight asked Tucker to rescind the transfer of cases 
because of the inconvenience that it will cause local parents and children, who 
have been able to attend hearings at the Lancaster courthouse since July. 
</P>
<P>
 "This discontinuance of services is not only very disturbing but is 
unacceptable," Knight said, "especially in light of the earthquake, which has 
rendered travel to Monterey Park to be difficult, if not impossible, for most 
residents." 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, dependency hearings for Antelope Valley families were heard in 
Van Nuys courtrooms. These cases were moved to the county's new Monterey Park 
court complex in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the soaring number of child abuse cases in the Antelope Valley 
and the area's distance from Monterey Park, the county opened a satellite 
dependency court in Lancaster last summer. Dependency courts decide whether 
abused or neglected children should remain with their families or be placed 
elsewhere, such as in foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview Monday, Tucker said he decided to move all initial 
dependency hearings from Lancaster to Monterey Park for a three-month tryout 
because the small Lancaster courtroom is clogged with cases. Under his plan, a 
judge in Monterey Park would decide whether subsequent hearings would be held 
in Lancaster or Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court was being overloaded with cases in Lancaster," he said. "The 
problem is the facility is inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tucker added, "We obviously hadn't counted on the earthquake. It has 
interrupted our experiment. Right now it's on hold." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he will reinstate the transfer of cases when he determines that 
travel conditions between Lancaster and Monterey Park have improved. 
</P>
<P>
 He and the Antelope Valley attorneys said the best solution would be expanded 
county court facilities in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors recently voted to postpone construction of a new Lancaster 
courthouse because of lack of funds. But some county officials said space could 
be leased elsewhere in the Antelope Valley to relieve the overcrowding.

VENTURA COUNCIL CONSIDERING CHANGE IN INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT; DEVELOPMENT: 
OFFICIALS DISCUSS ZONING THAT WOULD ALLOW COMMERCIAL, RESIDENTIAL USE FOR A 
PROJECT AFFECTING 77 ACRES OF THE OLD SECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council on Monday began to discuss changing the zoning for a 
proposed development in the northern Ventura Avenue area that could 
significantly alter the city's old industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Monday evening, the council was considering a change in the zoning 
from heavy industrial to commercial and residential uses for a proposed project 
affecting about 77 acres in the Ventura Avenue neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Monahan, who owns a welding company in the area, is a strong 
opponent of the proposed change.  
</P>
<P>
 "The north end of Ventura has traditionally been industrial, and we need to 
keep it that way," Monahan said in an interview before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neel and Huntsinger families and Kinko's -- the copy service company 
headquartered in the area -- want to develop their land by filling vacant lots 
and razing a lemon grove for 330 residential units, a park, business offices 
and industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been looking for investment in that area for a long time," Councilman 
Steve Bennett said in an interview. "You have to give careful consideration to 
anyone who wants to bring investment dollars to the Avenue because so few 
dollars have gone there recently." 
</P>
<P>
 The area is bounded by Stanley Avenue on the south, Seneca Street on the 
north, Ventura Avenue on the east and California 33 on the west. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some property owners in the area spoke against the proposed project Monday, 
saying they do not want their land rezoned for a development in which they are 
not participating. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neels, Huntsingers and Kinko's own about 52 acres, but they are also 
requesting city officials to change the zoning on about 25 acres of their 
neighbors' properties as well because it would spruce up the neighborhood and 
complement their project plans, said Steve Perlman, a land-use consultant hired 
by Kinko's and the Neel and Huntsinger families. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any quarrel with their right to develop their parcels. Just 
leave us alone," said Bill Kendall, partner in a real estate management firm 
that owns property nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Although businesses in the industrial area would be allowed to continue 
operating, they would be restricted to certain standards if they wanted to 
expand, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall said industrial-zoned land is already scarce in the city, and if the 
area is changed, manufacturers and heavy industry would have a more difficult 
time finding locations for new plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall said landlords are likely to become very selective in leasing to 
long-term tenants if the zoning changes. Under the proposal, landlords must 
begin leasing to light-industrial tenants if a heavy-industrial tenant leaves 
and the space is left vacant for more than six months. Light-industrial 
properties have a higher vacancy rate than their heavy-industrial counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every city, in order to survive, needs some heavy-industrial-zoned land," 
Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members echoed Kendall's concerns and said they want to preserve 
some of the industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always need a place to do your heavy work, clean out your paintbrushes, 
that type of thing," said Monahan, a longtime advocate of the Ventura Avenue 
industrial sector. His welding company is not in the affected area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Avenue needs that project, but I want to hear about protecting the other 
businesses out there," Councilman Jack Tingstrom said before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, Tingstrom said city leaders will be eager to try to accommodate the 
business needs of Kinko's, one of the city's largest employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed development, Kinko's would build a 60,000-square-foot 
addition to its headquarters, said President Dan Frederickson. The company 
employs about 400 people and is hoping to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's officials said if the project is rejected, the company may decide to 
build elsewhere in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be very interested in having Kinko's expand and stay here," Tingstrom 
said. "I'm sure we can work out some kind of compromise."

VENTURA COUNCIL APPROVES BAN ON SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council on Monday gave final approval to a sweeping law that 
bans smoking at all businesses and restaurants except bars. 
</P>
<P>
 The law would take effect in three months for most businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But under the ordinance law, restaurant owners with bars will have a year to 
wall off their bars and provide a separate ventilation system if they want to 
permit smoking at their bars. City officials decided to give restaurants with 
bars until February, 1995, to comply because of the time involved in permitting 
and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval of the smoking ban was delayed because restaurateurs launched a 
last-minute lobbying effort after the ban received preliminary approval in 
December. In hours of public testimony, restaurateurs argued that the ban will 
drive away customers. They also submitted a petition with more than 4,300 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council sided with anti-smoking activists, saying the health hazards 
of secondhand smoke have been well-documented. 
</P>
<P>
 By adopting the ban, Ventura joins Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Ojai and the 
county, which have passed similar laws.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; MOST PUBLIC SCHOOLS REOPEN IN SANTA CLARITA; 
RECOVERY: THREE DAMAGED SITES REMAIN CLOSED. CALARTS DAMAGE, ORIGINALLY 
ESTIMATED AT $50 MILLION, IS PUT AT $10 MILLION. 
</P>

<P>
 Most public classrooms opened for the first time here since last week's 
6.6-magnitude earthquake scattered desks, toppled bulletin boards and damaged 
some school facilities beyond immediate repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Good news was also heard at the California Institute of the Arts campus in 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Contradicting an earlier report by city officials that CalArts had suffered 
$50 million in damages, Anita Bonnell, CalArts director of public affairs, said 
the figure was less than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 City Public Information Officer Gail Foy said the city's numbers were based on 
a preliminary assessment by the city's building inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators and faculty toured the campus Monday to survey the damage and 
discuss when classes can resume. Bonnell said arrangements are being made for 
satellite classrooms at several Santa Clarita locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damage was widespread throughout the (campus)," said Bonnell. "It's just a 
lot of mess right now. Like your own home, only across 1,300 rooms." 
</P>
<P>
 CalArts was in the first week of its spring semester when the earthquake 
struck. Graduation has been postponed from May 13 to May 27. 
</P>
<P>
 While most Santa Clarita public schools reopened Monday, a few -- Hart High 
School and Placerita Junior High School, of the William S. Hart Union High 
School District, and Rosedell Elementary School, of the Saugus Union School 
District -- remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart district schools suffered almost $8 million in damages, Supt. Walt 
Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 School staff who returned to work Monday kept watch for any psychological 
impacts the quake may have had. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to tell what the impact of the quake and its aftershocks have 
had on students, said Mary Morris, school psychologist for the Hart district. 
</P>
<P>
 "The comments we're getting are more of 'Let's get back to the business at 
hand,' " said Morris. "Some (students) we are watching. They're not saying 
anything, but you can see it in their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosedell remains closed while officials in the Saugus Union School District 
check for uncontained asbestos. Three other schools were checked for asbestos 
last week and were found to be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus district Supt. Troy Bramlett estimated that it will take $1.5 million 
to repair schools, with the bulk of the cost for asbestos removal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably, because of this kind of shake, we may need to go in and take all of 
the asbestos out," Bramlett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes were back in session throughout the Newhall School District, which 
sustained $750,000 in damages, said Supt. J. Michael McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
 "All buildings have been inspected and are structurally sound. All repairs 
that are important have been completed and are ready to go," McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canyon Country-based Sulphur Springs School District suffered the least 
damage among Santa Clarita schools -- about $75,000 in cosmetic damages, Supt. 
Robert Nolet said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% of the district's 4,100 students returned to classes Monday, higher 
than administrators expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottled water has been placed in most Santa Clarita classrooms for students. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those children found the taps in their homes now working, as the 
Valencia Water Co. has restored water to most of its 15,000 customers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we'll probably have just about everyone up in the next 24 hours," 
Greg Millemanof Valencia Water Co. said at midday Monday. "There will be 
pockets of areas that are still out." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson Ranch and Sunset Pointe, west of the Golden State Freeway, remain 
without water and are not expected to have service restored until the end of 
the week.

OBITUARIES ; * ROBERT R. NYE; ROAD BUILDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert R. Nye of Ventura, a longtime Ventura County road builder, died 
Saturday at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Nye, who founded the Robert R. Nye Inc. road construction company in Ventura, 
received one of the state's top construction awards in 1988 for his work on the 
Ojai Valley Trail. He was honored for transforming an abandoned railroad track 
into a landscaped and well-used bicycle and equestrian trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Carrizozo, N. M., Nye moved to Ventura County in 1923 with his 
parents. He attended Ojai schools and obtained a bachelor of science degree in 
civil engineering in 1943 at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 After college, he joined the Naval Construction Battalion and built airstrips 
in the South Pacific during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, he worked for several engineering companies in Los Angeles, 
then founded his own company in 1955. In 1988, he helped his son, Ruric Nye, 
establish another road construction company, Nye & Nelson Inc. of Ventura, in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Nye was a charter member and past president of the tri-counties chapter 
of Associated General Contractors of America and was a state board member. 
Active in the Rotary Club, he was a Rotary Paul Harris fellow, the highest 
Rotarian award. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his son, survivors include his wife, Pilar; daughter Pamela, of 
Marin County; sister Mary Nye Pierpont of Ojai, and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Services will be at 2 p.m. Wednesday at the Ted Mayr Funeral Home in Ventura.

CENTURY FREEWAY GETS HIGH MARKS IN 1ST QUAKE TEST; SAFETY: NO STRESS CRACKS OR 
OTHER DAMAGE ARE FOUND IN THE 17.3-MILE ROADWAY. STATE-OF-THE-ART DESIGN IS 
CITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The infant Century Freeway apparently has passed its first tremor test with 
flying colors, Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary inspection of the 3-month-old freeway found no stress cracks or 
other damage after last week's magnitude 6.6 earthquake. The 105 Freeway has 
some of the county's highest overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans engineers said they were not surprised that the 17.3-mile roadway 
between Norwalk and El Segundo withstood the earthquake, while portions of the 
Santa Monica Freeway (10) buckled and an Antelope Valley Freeway (14) overpass 
collapsed onto the Golden State Freeway (5). 
</P>
<P>
 "We've learned from every earthquake we've had in California, and we've 
changed the design standards each time," said Caltrans district director Jerry 
B. Baxter. "The Century was built using the most modern standards, and 
obviously, they worked."  
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said the key factor is that additional steel bars were used to 
reinforce concrete columns supporting the Century Freeway's 12 lanes and 
numerous overpasses, on-ramps and off-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans began requiring steel reinforcement in freeway bridges and overpasses 
following the 1971 Sylmar quake, which toppled freeway overpasses. The agency 
is in the middle of a $1.5-billion reinforcement program designed to shore up 
bridges and overpasses with steel encasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Columns supporting the bridges and overpasses along the Santa Monica Freeway 
-- including the three that buckled and partially collapsed Monday morning -- 
were scheduled to be retrofitted this spring, Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we knew (the Century Freeway columns) didn't need to be 
strengthened," Baxter said. "They are about as strong as they come, and were 
built with every safety feature we know of." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Baxter said, the Century is probably more seismically safe than many 
homes in the communities it traverses.  
</P>
<P>
 "People might be afraid to go back on the freeways," he said. "But most of 
them are living in homes that were built . . . when earthquake standards were 
virtually unheard of. If I were them, I'd rather be on the (Century) freeway 
when the next one hits." 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.2-billion highway opened in October, with computerized traffic monitors 
and closed-circuit television cameras to alert officials to accidents. The 
freeway was built to serve as another east-west route for commuters, but Baxter 
predicts it will become a primary thoroughfare as drivers seek detours around 
the closed sections of the Santa Monica Freeway.

TEMBLOR IS A DOUBLE HIT FOR MANY INSURERS; RECOVERY: BESIDES SCRAMBLING TO 
HANDLE CLAIMS, A NUMBER OF COMPANIES SUFFERED DAMAGE TO THEIR FACILITIES. 
REINSURANCE WILL CUSHION THE PAYOUT BLOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Just three months ago, 20th Century Insurance Co. was counting its blessings 
as it escaped the Southland wildfires with relatively few claims. But this 
time, the company got whacked -- and in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Monday morning of the earthquake, it looked like a bomb had exploded 
inside 20th Century's 11-story headquarters building in Woodland Hills. Roughly 
100 panes of glass were blown out, beige drapes hung out windows like unmade 
bed sheets, and the building was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 By the morning after the earthquake, 20th Century's parking lot had been 
converted into a makeshift claims center. Anxious homeowners who drove in saw a 
cardboard sign that read "Customers" directing them to a dozen claims adjusters 
who sat at tables filling in by hand claims forms and passing out bottled 
water. As soon as a form was done, it was handed to another worker who promptly 
faxed it to 20th Century's catastrophe claims office in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's building has since reopened and as of Monday it had received 
more than 15,000 homeowner claims, plus another 2,500 damage reports from car 
owners. 20th Century has 200,000 homeowner policies, with about 40% of them 
carrying earthquake coverage. But the financial damage for 20th Century figures 
to be relatively light because its earthquake policies typically have a 
deductible of 10% of a home's value -- excluding land costs. So payments won't 
kick in unless damage to a home exceeds that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bear didn't eat us on this one, but it got a good piece of our leg," said 
Rick Dinon, 20th Century's senior vice president. Dinon said 20th Century's 
damage claims on the 6.6-magnitude temblor will run between $10 million and 
$100 million, well more than the $6.5 million in claims it paid out from the 
1987 Whittier quake, which measured magnitude 5.9. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century wasn't the only insurer hit hard by the quake. Structural cracks 
and falling ceiling panels made Allstate's regional office in Woodland Hills 
unusable; the company improvised by using mobile homes as claim centers. State 
Farm, the state's largest insurer, flew agents in from out of state after 40 of 
its agents' offices in the San Fernando Valley were damaged. And Farmers 
Insurance's five-story regional facility in Simi Valley had yellow tape around 
it all last week. 
</P>

 "We're still not sure of the level of damage to that building," said Farmers' 
spokesman Jeff Beyer. But the building has been cleared by safety inspectors, 
he said, and most of the 1,000-plus employees returned to their jobs Monday. 
Last week the company established a 24-hour claims center in Pasadena. Farmers 
and other insurers wanted to be seen as providing rapid service, especially to 
people such as state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, who has been very 
critical of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Financially, insurers face proportionately larger losses than they did in the 
Bay Area's Loma Prieta quake in 1989, because about 40% of Southern California 
homeowners have earthquake insurance, contrasted with about 25% for the rest of 
the state, said Steve Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance Information 
Institute, a trade group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein estimated that total insured losses from the Northridge quake will 
be about $1.5 billion -- 50% more than the Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Few homeowners buy earthquake coverage because it generally doubles their 
insurance premium and carries that hefty 10% deductible. Also, some homeowner 
policies have smaller, but separate deductibles, for content losses. 
(Comprehensive auto insurance includes quake damage.) 
</P>
<P>
 For homeowners in Southern California, quake insurance costs $2 per $1,000 of 
coverage, Goldstein said. With the average price of a house in the San Fernando 
Valley at about $253,000, the typical homeowner who has full quake coverage 
would have to pay out-of-pocket the first $25,300 of damages before the 
earthquake insurance kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 70,000 loss reports have been filed so far, and the destruction of 
insurance company offices and the lingering aftershocks have made it hard for 
claims adjusters and engineers to enter homes. That means a potentially long 
wait for those filing claims. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning after the earthquake, 20th Century's chief executive, Neil H. 
Ashley, dressed in jeans, a plaid shirt and a baseball cap, hiked up to the 
seventh floor of his scarred building. The place was still closed, save for a 
few workers inside. The elevators, computers and electricity were out, plaster 
dusted the floors, cracks marred the walls, and notes were taped to doors 
telling repair crews where other people were. "We've been giving out additional 
living-expense checks right out there in the parking lot" for the worst claims, 
Ashley said, as aftershocks kept wobbling the building. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those waiting in 20th Century's parking lot claims line was Greg 
Maksimenko of Chatsworth. He had earthquake insurance. He also used to have a 
block wall running around his property, but the wall had caved in. "There are 
six neighbors who are sharing a common yard now," he said, wondering aloud: "Is 
that wall part of the structural policy or not? Guess I'll find out." 
</P>
<P>
 But many who filed claims a week ago are still waiting for a visit from a 20th 
Century appraiser, because the insurer is handling claims in the usual 
triage-like manner, with the worst cases getting first attention. "We're 
prioritizing the claims. On the worst cases, we're responding if possible on 
the same day," Dinon said. 
</P>
<P>
 For some insurance companies, the financial blow from the earthquake will be 
softened by catastrophe reinsurance, which insurers buy to spread their own 
risk. But those big earthquake insurance deductibles are tough on both 
homeowners and on insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider that 20th Century's Lloyd's of London earthquake reinsurance policy 
costs it $13 million in annual premiums, and before Lloyd's pays out its first 
farthing, 20th Century has to pay out $10 million in claims -- in effect a 
deductible. Only then does Lloyd's pay 75% of additional claims -- up to a 
maximum of $75 million -- with 20th Century paying the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Which means that if 20th Century reaches the maximum of its earthquake policy 
it must first pay $48 million in premiums, deductibles and co-payments just to 
get $75 million in coverage from Lloyd's -- or roughly $1.50 back for every $1 
spent for earthquake reinsurance. "That isn't particularly generous," Dinon 
said, "But earthquake reinsurance premiums are kind of supply and demand." 
</P>
<P>
 His company's tab for earthquake reinsurance almost doubled in its latest 
policy, Dinon said, because of "storms in Europe, Hurricane Andrew and 
worldwide catastrophe losses." Certainly the bad news from Northridge made its 
way to London in a hurry. Lloyd's of London is already struggling with years of 
heavy claims: In the most recent report available, Lloyd's in 1990 posted a 
record loss of 2.9 million British pounds, or about $4.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 For most companies, however, reinsurance won't help nearly as much in the past 
because the spate of major disasters in recent years, including the Los Angeles 
riots and the recent wildfires, has caused the cost of reinsurance to 
skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Big firms such as State Farm don't even buy reinsurance, and for them the 
financial effect of the Northridge earthquake will be relatively modest. But 
the quake will have a big impact on small insurers such as Associated 
International Insurance Co. The tiny Woodland Hills-based company specializes 
in selling quake coverage to business owners, who, because of the cost, are 
even less likely to buy catastrophe insurance than homeowners. (Unlike 
homeowner's insurance, earthquake coverage for businesses must be sold as a 
separate policy.) 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in 1972, a year after the devastating Sylmar quake, Associated has 50 
employees and about 3,000 policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 In its latest report filed with the state, Associated earned a handsome profit 
of $6.3 million in 1992 on premium revenue of $43 million. It currently has an 
"A" or excellent rating from A. M. Best. 
</P>
<P>
 But that rating is in jeopardy. Matthew Peller, a senior vice president, said 
he expects the Northridge quake to hit his company with about $30 million in 
claims. Two of Associated's customers are Rocketdyne in Canoga Park, and 
Northridge Fashion Center. Both facilities sustained heavy damage from the 
quake. At the Northridge mall, the parking garage caved in and the Bullock's 
department store has been condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phone has been ringing constantly," Peller said. A bit frantically, he 
added last week: "We're working with a short staff, we're having aftershocks, 
things are falling out of the ceiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Reinsurance through Lloyd's and other firms in Europe and Bermuda will 
significantly cut Associated's losses, just as it did after the Loma Prieta 
quake in 1989, when Associated reported a gross loss of $32 million but a net 
loss of only $2.2 million after reinsurance payments. But Peller suggested that 
last week's quake will probably be more costly to Associated because of the 
dramatic increase in reinsurance rates since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Graham, executive vice president at E. W. Blanch Co., a reinsurance 
broker in San Francisco, said the onslaught of disasters in recent years has 
basically doubled catastrophe reinsurance premiums in 1993 from 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance firms now pay about 30 cents in reinsurance premiums to get back $1, 
Graham said. But premiums are not expected to increase because of the latest 
quake, he said, because eight new reinsurance companies were formed last year 
in Bermuda, where tax rates are favorable, thus greatly adding to the supply of 
reinsurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the magnitude of last week's earthquake, 20th Century figures to have 
plenty of money to cover its claims. The company has a $600-million capital 
surplus, Dinon said, and it posted an $89.8-million profit on revenues of 
$817.3 million for the nine months that ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Among insurers that escaped with relatively few claims was TIG Insurance in 
Woodland Hills, formerly known as Transamerica Insurance Group. Its latest 
tally was just 700 quake claims, said spokeswoman Cheryl Friedling. But the 
company's parking lot is unusable, and one of TIG's buildings in Woodland Hills 
sustained "significant structural damage," forcing the company to transfer 
dozens of workers elsewhere, Friedling said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another insurer that escaped with few claims was Unico American in Woodland 
Hills. Through its Crusader Insurance subsidiary, Unico insures about 2,200 
mom-and-pop businesses in the Valley area, but it does not offer earthquake 
insurance. Unico also has about 200 homeowner policies, but only 16 of them 
included earthquake coverage. As such, Unico says it expects just a handful of 
claims and minimal losses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Unico's headquarters' building wasn't so fortunate. Cary Cheldin, Unico's 
executive vice president and son of the company's founder, Erwin Cheldin, 
arrived at 6 a.m. on the morning of the quake, carrying a flashlight. The 
building's air conditioning and heating equipment was knocked loose, he said. 
Fallen ceiling tiles were everywhere. File cabinets were overturned by the 
jolt, and about 100 computer terminals and 100 typewriters had fallen from 
desks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheldin spent most of last week cleaning up and, until the plumbing was fixed, 
he and other Unico executives made frequent trips to a creek behind the 
building for pails of water so the toilets could be manually flushed. Cheldin 
said there was no structural damage to the building, but Unico still expects to 
have big repair bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheldin said Unico has a $9-million earthquake policy for the building through 
Associated International, for which Unico pays $20,000 annually. But that 
policy came with a 5% deductible, so Unico must pay the first $450,000 in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put Associated on notice," Cheldin said. "But odds are whatever losses we 
have are under that deductible."

PROMENADE MALL BEATS ITS RIVAL TO THE PUNCH; RETAIL: CREWS WORKING FEVERISHLY 
MANAGE TO OPEN THE SHOPPING CENTER THE FIRST WEEKEND AFTER THE QUAKE, BEFORE 
COMPETITOR TOPANGA PLAZA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A shaky but mostly intact Promenade mall reopened for business Saturday, 
getting a jump-start if not a symbolic advantage over its more successful 
neighbor, Topanga Plaza, which is only one block away but remains closed due to 
damage suffered in last week's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-two of the Promenade's approximately 60 stores and restaurants were 
open during the weekend, with others scheduled to reopen later this week, 
including two of its three anchor stores, Bullocks and Saks. It is not known 
when I. Magnin, the third anchor store, will reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Promenade manager Kim Solomon said the cost of the damage caused by the 
6.6-magnitude earthquake has not been tallied but she expect's the mall's 
earthquake insurance to cover most of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Jittery earthquake survivors began trickling back to the mall on Saturday, but 
most merchants said business was slow over the weekend. Nevertheless, Solomon 
was encouraged by activity during the first weekend after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business was fair," she said. "We didn't set the world on fire, but people 
are ready to get their lives back to normal, and shopping is part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old Promenade, which underwent a $40-million renovation in 1993, 
came out of the earthquake in much better shape than Topanga Plaza, which is 
likely to remain closed for several weeks. The Promenade's trademark skylight, 
which gives it a bright and airy appearance, suffered nary a crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers and the mall's owner, the New York-based O'Connor Group, hope the 
Herculean effort to bring the shopping center back to life will quickly give 
the Promenade a head start in its fierce competition with Topanga Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor officials are unofficially marketing the Promenade as the Rodeo Drive 
of the San Fernando Valley, catering to affluent shoppers with plenty of 
disposable income. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the broken windows, cracked tiles, crooked letter E on the exterior 
Promenade sign and upended merchandise resulting from last week's earthquake 
gave the Promenade an appearance that was no different from the hundreds of 
other retail malls throughout the Valley that were damaged by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The only consolations to Solomon and Promenade merchants were that Topanga 
Plaza and other major malls in the Valley fared much worse, and that the 
Promenade escaped any structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we should be thankful that we're not at Topanga Plaza. At least here 
when we open depends on how fast we can get this store back together," said 
John Robertson, as he helped his mother, Martha Wilcox, owner of Martha's Leg 
Fashions, clean the damaged store. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, an army of construction workers and cleanup crews worked with 
military efficiency to prepare the mall for Saturday's scheduled opening. 
Platoons of workers and employees of the various stores worked at a feverish 
pace to sweep up debris, replace shattered windows and tiles, rehang buckled 
doors and restock shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "People at the malls are getting organized. Work is starting to pick up. We're 
working 14-hour days not just here but at strip malls throughout the Valley," 
said Paul Wilson of Redondo Beach, an employee of RAS Builders. Wilson and his 
partner, Jose Lopez of Inglewood, were boarding up Bullocks' second-floor 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The pungent smell of garlic and pizza sauce wafted throughout the second 
floor. It did not take long to trace the odor to the Williams-Sonoma store, 
where the floor was stained and littered with olive oil, sauces and glass from 
broken cookware and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 About half a dozen workers hired by the store were making no attempt to save 
anything that toppled to the floor during the quake. Using wide shovels, the 
workers scooped the floor clean and dumped the stuff into oversized plastic 
garbage cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's garlic city, but it smells good," said a mall employee who happened by. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside Williams-Sonoma, the store manager, who had been supervising the 
odorous cleanup for three days, joked about the pervasive smell of garlic, 
herbs and spices. "We've all decided we won't be eating any of our pizza sauce 
anytime soon," said the woman, who declined to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
 While most retailers struggled mightily to clear away debris, restock 
merchandise and deal with contractors hired to fix the lights and replace 
windows, Anne Cohen, manager of the D. Laurenti men's store, occupied herself 
with more mundane matters, like writing signs for the store's weekend 
"EARTHQUAKE SALE!" 
</P>
<P>
 The native of Brighton, England, cleaned her store, put the shirts back on the 
racks and hand-rolled dozens of bright floral ties and wedged them back in 
display cases. The store, located on the ground floor, suffered very little 
serious damage save for merchandise that toppled over. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, Cohen was ready for customers and waited patiently for the 
weekend. "I'm a very organized person. We're trying to make the store look like 
nothing happened," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, D. Laurenti stood out like an island of organization in a sea of 
confusion, dust, buzzing saws and the smell of freshly cut wood. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second floor, a crew of young women walked around Victoria's Secret, 
picking up hundreds of bottles of shower gel and lotion and other merchandise 
that littered the floor of the lingerie shop. The manager methodically 
inventoried every item that was picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so lucky was the owner of Lolita's, a crystalware shop that opened about a 
month ago. Although the store had been cleaned by Thursday, mall employees said 
it looked like it had been ransacked by a raging bull. Shards of fine crystal 
were swept up along with jagged pieces of glass from the store's broken windows 
and display cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was glass everywhere. It was so sad to see the owner's face," said 
Victoria Hagopian, manager of the Mondi women's apparel shop next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for broken windows, Hagopian's store was ready for business last 
Thursday. By Thursday afternoon, Hagopian had already restocked the shelves, 
put the clothes back on hangers and swept up debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Her most pressing problem was figuring out a faster way to get to work from 
her Santa Clarita home. With the closure of the Antelope Valley and Golden 
State freeways, her 45-minute commute had turned into a three-hour nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first floor, Yvette Valencia, manager of the Joan Vass store, and 
employee Jasan Klepp were busy putting clothes back on racks and getting the 
store ready for the Saturday reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on in," Klepp said to a visitor who walked through an opening where a 
window should be. "We may get our windows back by tomorrow, depending on how 
fast this guy can work," she added, nodding toward a worker who was measuring 
for windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other store employees throughout the mall, Klepp was drawing a salary 
while the mall remained closed. "Our company is paying us, even though the 
store has been closed. That has eased the stress brought on by the earthquake a 
little bit," said Klepp, a resident of Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup at the Nature Co. store, a gift shop with an environmental theme, 
on the first floor was speeded along with the help of employees brought down 
from the company's Santa Barbara store and with the unexpected help of Gordon 
Maybury, the company's vice president in charge of retail, and other officers 
from the corporate office in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybury had just landed in New York when he heard about the quake and turned 
right around and flew out here," said store manager Judi Morales, who commutes 
from Costa Mesa. "Our corporate people got it together very quickly. We 
couldn't have completed the cleanup this fast without their help."

LENDERS OFFER FLEXIBLE HELP TO QUAKE VICTIMS; BORROWING: INSTITUTIONS BIG AND 
SMALL ARE WILLING TO ADJUST REPAYMENT SCHEDULES AND PROVIDE STREAMLINED LOAN 
APPLICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Small business owners and consumers whose buildings or homes were damaged or 
destroyed in last week's earthquake may benefit from flexible repayment 
schedules on any outstanding installment loans and a streamlined application 
process for new loans offered by some local banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Both large financial institutions such as Great Western Bank and smaller ones 
such as California United Bank are stepping in with special programs to assist 
consumers who suffered major losses in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they have to do is ask. In the majority of cases there is something that 
can be worked out to help people who need more time to repay a loan or quick 
cash to repair a damaged business," said Marshall Milligan, chief executive 
officer of Ventura County-based Bank of A. Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's portfolio of commercial loans, including small business loans, is 
about $150 million, Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Bank of A. Levy is allowing forbearance to people unable to keep 
current on loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Each case is looked at individually to determine how much time the borrower 
needs to catch up on loan payments, said Milligan. 
</P>
<P>
 "You also have cases where business owners need quick cash to begin repairs. 
In these cases, we're trying to speed up the process by making unsecured loans, 
again on a case-by-case basis," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton released another $240 million in Small Business 
Administration loans last week to help local businesses rebound from the 
earthquake, and several local banks will play a role in getting some of those 
funds out where they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 American Pacific State Bank, based in Sherman Oaks, is the fourth biggest 
issuer of SBA loans in the country, and already has a sizable SBA loan 
portfolio in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 American Pacific has contacted every one of its SBA loan holders to offer help 
if they need it, said Jim Degnan, executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're open to any reasonable request made of us by our customers," said 
Degnan. "We've instructed our managers to go outside of individual loan limits 
if it makes sense right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Degnan added: "We're also offering our customers an opportunity to make 
interest-only payments on their (SBA) loans so they can use the rest of the 
money to replenish their inventory. And if they have to extend themselves with 
other creditors who may be nervous about our customers' financial situation, 
we're asking them to have these creditors call us and we'll tell them what kind 
of people our customers are." 
</P>
<P>
 American Pacific has six branches throughout the Valley and an SBA portfolio 
of $100 million and community loans totaling $110 million, said Degnan. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that other customers who have installment loans with the bank are also 
eligible for the interest-only payment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 CU Bancorp, the parent of California United Bank based in Encino, with only 
three SBA loans on its books, has also been approached by SBA officials and 
asked to help finance the rebuilding of businesses in the battered Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been asked to do bridge financing, and we're anxious to help in any 
way. We've also offered to donate office space to SBA officials who are out 
here," said Dave Rainer, California United Bank chief operations officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA loan application process can be lengthy and cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
 Some applicants, whose damaged or destroyed businesses are their sole source 
of income, simply cannot wait for the normal application process to run its 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 "The approval and documentation process on an SBA loan takes time. But there 
are people out there who are in immediate need of a loan, and we can help them 
with bridge financing," said Rainer. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a bridge financing plan, California United Bank will make an SBA loan to 
a pre-qualified applicant shortly after the application is submitted and before 
all of the paperwork is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank will be repaid when the SBA completes the paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Large banking institutions such as Great Western have been running newspaper 
ads to advise their customers in Los Angeles and Ventura counties affected by 
the earthquake of special programs designed to help them with credit card or 
loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Great Western customers may be eligible for a moratorium on their monthly 
mortgage payments for up to three months without late charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bank's credit card customers could be eligible for an 
increase in their credit limit or payment deferrals of up to 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 But many banks and S&Ls who are giving borrowers deferrals on their payments 
still must come up with those overdue payments in a lump sum once these payment 
schedules resume. Some consumers have said this is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 And given the long slump in residential real estate values even before the 
earthquake, and because even those homeowners with earthquake insurance have 
large deductibles on their policies, it seems likely that some people will just 
walk away from their homes, boosting the number of foreclosures in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "For people with major damage, I'd expect them to walk away. Wouldn't you?" 
said Ben Hunnicutt, who runs Southland Financial Network, a Woodland Hills 
mortgage broker. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows several families in the area whose homes will "have to be bulldozed. 
It seems the number of foreclosures has to increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western spokesman Ian Campbell said it was "reasonable to expect some 
losses," particularly from foreclosures stemming from homeowners who decide 
that it would be too expensive to rebuild a damaged or destroyed home and 
instead walk away from their mortgage loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, our preliminary analysis indicates that our losses will be small. If 
past experience is an indicator, you'll find that a surprisingly large number 
of people are so attached to their homes that they will rebuild and keep up 
their loans," Campbell said.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: NEW IMAGE REPORTS FLAT EARNINGS, HIGHER REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Image Industries Inc., a Canoga Park company that sells intraoral cameras 
and dental imaging equipment, reported that its fiscal second-quarter earnings 
were essentially flat at $1.42 million, compared to $1.44 million in net income 
a year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's revenue for the three months ended Dec. 31 rose 36%, to $10.9 
million from $8.03 million.It said the results reflected growing demand from 
dentists for its products. 
</P>
<P>
 It also said that its fiscal second-quarter profit would have increased 71% 
from a year earlier without the results of Styles on Video, its former 
subsidiary that was spun off to shareholders last March. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months, New Image earned $2.1 million, down 6% from $2.23 million 
a year earlier. Its revenue rose 21%, to $16.4 million from $13.5 million.

 Vitesse Semiconductor Corp., a Camarillo maker of gallium arsenide computer

 Cherokee Inc., the Sunland-based maker of apparel and footwear, reported a 
fiscal second-quarter loss of $4.9 million because of a $6-million charge to 
restructure and implement a new operating strategy.

other assets.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: MORTGAGE AND REALTY TRUST REPORTS LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mortgage and Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust with offices in 
Burbank and Elkins Park, Pa., reported larger net losses for its fiscal fourth 
quarter and year ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust's three-month loss was $23.3 million, up from a $12.6-million loss a 
year earlier. For the fiscal year, it lost $54 million, in contrast with a 
$37.5 million loss in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest fiscal year, the trust's provision for losses totaled $37 
million. Deteriorating real estate values caused by generally lower rental 
rates, an oversupply of space and a lack of liquidity in the real estate 
industry continued to hurt its income-producing properties, Mortgage and Realty 
Trust said.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: NEWHALL LAND DOUBLES EARNINGS IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newhall Land & Farming Co., a Valencia real estate developer, reported that 
its fourth quarter earnings more than doubled, to $9.6 million from $4.26 
million a year earlier. Its revenue in the quarter that ended Dec. 31 was $49 
million, down 11% from $55.3 million in the same period of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of 1993, the company had a profit of $12.8 million, down 26% from 
$17.2 million in net income in the previous year. Its revenue fell 18% to 
$105.5 million from $128.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land also said that its four-story office building in Valencia Town 
Center had some structural damage due to the Jan. 17 earthquake, but that it 
would take several days to determine the extent of that damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia Town Center, the company's shopping mall, which opened in 1992, had 
minor damage and was expected to reopen within a few days after the quake. The 
company said that it has earthquake insurance, which will limit its losses. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the collapse of parts of the Golden State and Antelope Valley 
freeways pose a long-term problem for the company because of lack of customer 
access to the Santa Clarita Valley.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: PLAYERS INTERNATIONAL TO BUILD RIVERBOAT CASINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Players International Inc., a Calabasas-based operator of riverboat casinos, 
said Maryland Heights, Mo., has approved the company's bid to develop a 
riverboat casino in the St. Louis suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 Players now has riverboats in Metropolis, Ill., and Lake Charles, La. 
</P>
<P>
 In Maryland Heights it plans to operate a boat with 25,000 square feet of 
gambling space. Shore-side facilities would include a sports complex, retail 
shops, restaurants, nightclubs and other attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, real estate magnate Donald Trump is negotiating for an extension 
of an option he bought last summer from Players to develop a casino in 
Gulfport, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Trump paid $250,000 to Players and Las Vegas-based Jackpot 
Enterprises Inc. for an option to purchase rights to the site -- which Players 
and Jackpot co-owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the original agreement, Trump was to close the transaction on Jan. 11 by 
paying Players and Jackpot $2 million each and $250,000 each annually for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Aranow, chief financial officer at Players, said the agreement with 
Trump was still on. 
</P>
<P>
 But in December plans by Trump and Lady Luck Gaming Corp. to develop two 
separate casinos at the Mississippi port were temporarily denied by the state 
gaming commission after Dole Fresh Fruit, a unit of Dole Food Co. of Westlake 
Village, told the gaming commission that more gambling halls would hinder the 
movement of its trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lady Luck said it was trying to negotiate a solution with Dole and the gaming 
commission. Trump officials could not be reached for comment.

 Fortune Petroleum Corp. in Agoura Hills said it will take a onetime special 
charge of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter to reflect lower oil prices, 
resulting in a significant loss for its just-completed fiscal year.

the company said its earnings will be higher in 1994 and in the future.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: QUAKE MAY HAVE ECONOMIC UPSIDE: THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the destruction that hit much of Ventura County as a result of last 
week's earthquake and its aftershocks, the quake's long-range financial impact 
on the county should be positive, in the view of Cal Lutheran University 
economics professor Jamshid Damooei. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of jobs will be created to repair the damage to homes, industrial 
plants, stores and public facilities, predicts Damooei, an expert on the 
county's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The construction industry will be the main beneficiary, but numerous other 
fields, such as retailing and finance, will benefit, too," he said. "A great 
many support services prosper when building activity expands." 
</P>
<P>
 Damooei expects the upsurge to last through the rest of this year and to 
continue into 1995. "By then, Ventura County's slowly developing comeback could 
kick in. Tragic as the earthquake was, it could mark the beginning of a 
long-term business improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the gains, however, the county will suffer all-too-apparent losses, 
the economist noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Millions of dollars in assets have been destroyed. Some of it will never be 
recovered. Even state and federal aid, as welcome as it is, must be paid for by 
somebody somewhere," he said.

Chamber of Commerce President Mike McCaffrey believes it will be six to 12 
weeks before business returns to near normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "By then, most companies will be back in operation," he said. "However, I 
would guess that it will be six months before things are completely normal." 
</P>
<P>
 McCaffrey declined to estimate how many people were thrown out of work because 
of damaged facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But he reported that even companies that seemingly sustained only minor damage 
face delays in getting back to work, since their buildings must first pass 
official inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the largest facilities closed down in Simi Valley was Farmers Insurance 
Group's Los Angeles regional office on Cochran Street, where 900 are employed. 
Most of the workers were told to stay home throughout last week. About 250 were 
permitted to return to the five-story building to help clean up damaged 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of computers and filing cabinets were tossed around," said Farmers Vice 
President Jeff Beyer. "We also had some burst pipes on the third floor. The 
water caused damage on the first three floors." Farmers expects to have its 
building fully operational this week, Beyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Simi Valley warehouse of Pacific Beverage Co., branch manager Burt von 
Bieberstein said 25,000 cases of beer in bottles and cans had to be destroyed 
after crashing to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had three small bulldozers working most of the week cleaning up the mess," 
he said. Employees from other Pacific warehouses helped get the plant ready to 
reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 The main damage at clothing manufacturer Bugle Boy Industries was a shattered 
atrium at the plant's entrance. In addition, thousands of garments were tossed 
about in the firm's main headquarters and a nearby retail distribution center. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Arnie Carr said most of Bugle Boy's 700 employees in Simi Valley 
worked without interruption, though some stayed home because of damage to their 
residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Simi Valley businesses that were closed for at least part of last week 
included Micom Communications Corp., which employs 325, and Whittaker 
Electronic Systems, which closed one of its two plants in the city.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: HOME SALES EXPECTED TO BOUNCE BACK BY '95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Both commercial and residential brokers feel the county's real estate market 
will come back from a near standstill that followed the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some changes may have to be made in the terms of home sales that are in 
escrow," said Stephanie Schieltz, general manager of the five countywide 
offices of Coldwell Banker Town & Country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lenders in the east county are demanding new inspections before escrows 
close. If there's damage, it will be up to the seller to have it repaired." 
Some prices may be renegotiated, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schieltz, whose offices employ 200 agents, said Coldwell had 300 deals in 
escrow when the earthquake hit. She expects a large majority to go through with 
the transactions anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offices in Camarillo and Ventura are doing well and should continue to do 
so. Newbury Park is doing all right, too. In Thousand Oaks, cracks developed in 
some houses, and that could affect sales and closings. The worst problems are 
in eastern Simi Valley. " 
</P>
<P>
 Schieltz predicted that the east county's real estate market will bounce back 
in a manner reminiscent of the San Fernando Valley's resurgence following the 
1971 Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big surge in sales won't come until 1995, she suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Newton, commercial marketing director for First American Title Insurance 
Co. in Oxnard, predicted that the disaster will accelerate the migration to 
Ventura County of businesses from the Valley and other parts of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two days of the quake, a commercial agent in Ventura county received an 
inquiry from a Valley firm seeking a 40,000-square-foot plant, Newton reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, the quake caused postponement of the forthcoming Ventura County 
Real Estate Forum from Feb. 3 to Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Newton, who is co-chairman of the commercial panel, explained: "We expect 
people to be coming from L.A. They'll need time to regroup."

COURT BACKS AIRPORTS ON FEE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision that is likely to lead to a major victory for Los Angeles 
airport officials, the Supreme Court ruled Monday that local authorities have 
broad power to impose "reasonable" charges on airlines for use of their 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 7-1 vote, the court rejected a claim by the airline industry that courts 
should carefully review landing charges and limit fees that might be considered 
excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling rebuffs a challenge by Northwest Airlines to higher fees imposed at 
the Grand Rapids, Mich., airport but the case has been closely watched because 
the major airlines made a nearly identical legal attack on the sharply higher 
fees imposed last year at Los Angeles International Airport, the nation's third 
busiest. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court said that federal law puts only two clear limits on airport 
fees. First, municipal officials may not impose a per-passenger charge. Second, 
they may not divert money from airport fees to pay for non-airport expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, an airport's fees are legal so long as they are "based on some fair 
approximation" of its costs, the court said. An airport board may even 
accumulate a substantial surplus because the money could be needed for future 
building costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The law "does not authorize judicial inquiry focused on the amount of the 
airport's surplus," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsburg also said that the courts should not substitute for federal 
regulatory oversight, which is provided by the Department of Transportation. An 
airline attorney said Monday that air carriers may now ask transportation 
officials to review the fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the major airlines protested after the Los Angeles Department of 
Airports decided to impose a threefold increase, to $1.56 per 1,000 pounds 
gross weight on landing. Under the new fee schedule, a typical Boeing 747 would 
pay $900 to land at LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the new fees at LAX remain well below the levels at other major 
airports, such as Kennedy International in New York ($2.21 per 1,000 pounds), 
O'Hare International in Chicago ($2.27 per 1,000) and Washington Dulles ($2.70 
per 1,000). 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the airlines initially refused to pay the higher fees at LAX, and 
airport officials threatened to bar them from landing. In December, a showdown 
was averted when the airlines agreed to pay the fees under protest while they 
fight them in federal court in Los Angeles. The case is pending before U.S. 
District Judge A. Wallace Tashima. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, airport officials said that they were delighted with 
Monday's decision and predicted that it will lead to the dismissal of the 
pending lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This validates what we were saying from the beginning, that municipalities 
can set reasonable rates and charges for the airport," said Ted Stein, 
president of the Los Angeles Airport Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead lawyer for the airlines agreed that his clients are not likely to 
prevail in the federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear the (Supreme) court really didn't want to get into the business of 
scrutinizing rates at airports," said Walter A. Smith Jr., who represents 
Northwest Airlines in the Los Angeles case. He noted, however, that the 
airlines remain free to file a complaint with the Transportation Department 
alleging that the fees are unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling also came as no surprise to lawyers who have followed the case 
closely. Repeatedly, the justices have taken a hands-off approach to complex 
matters of federal regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 During the oral argument in the Michigan case in November, Chief Justice 
William H. Rehnquist wondered aloud why federal judges should be presumed to 
have the expertise to scrutinize the mathematical formulas for assessing fees 
charged to commercial airlines, general aviation and concession operators. That 
job would be handled better by officials in the Federal Aviation 
Administration, a branch of the Transportation Department, he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its legal authority, the FAA has not aggressively examined airport 
fees. In December, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena announced that his 
department will act promptly in the future to resolve a dispute, such as that 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's opinion in the case (Northwest Airlines vs. Kent County, 92-97), 
stops short of ordering judges to drop any cases involving airport fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our opinion in this case emphasizes that the (Transportation Department) has 
regulatory authority to enforce the federal aviation laws," Ginsburg wrote. 
"There is no cause for the courts to offer a substitute for conventional public 
utility regulation." 
</P>
<P>
 In their appeals, the airlines argued that fees for using the nation's 
airports rose 83% in the last decade, while their profits plummeted. In 1991, 
the commercial airlines paid $3.4 billion in airport fees, amounting to 4.5% of 
their total costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Their lawyers urged the Supreme Court to rein in the fees but federal law does 
not set distinct limits. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, Congress barred airports from charging per-passenger fees but it also 
said that airport authorities may "collect reasonable rental charges, landing 
fees and other service charges from aircraft operators for the use of airport 
facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsburg said that those words give judges little authority for intervening. 
Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, charging that the majority opinion appears 
to give federal regulators a "broad mandate" to review airport charges.

SCHOOLS' HIGH DENSITY AREAS HARDEST HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS and DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than half the Los Angeles schools that flunked their safety tests and 
will remain closed today suffered significant earthquake damage to cafeterias 
or other places where large numbers of students tend to gather, inspection 
reports disclosed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 76 schools deemed uninhabitable, at least 56 were found to have 
unusable cafeterias because of structural damage or other problems, such as 
natural gas leaks, according to reports compiled by the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said much of the damage occurred in kitchens rather than in student 
eating areas. 
</P>
<P>
 At 23 campuses, auditoriums were found unusable, and at eight schools the main 
offices were rendered useless by last week's 6.6-magnitude earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight schools in the hardest-hit sections of the San Fernando Valley will 
remain closed indefinitely, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the damage suffered by schools throughout the city, state and district 
officials said that the buildings fared well overall during the temblor and 
that much of the damage was cosmetic. Even the cafeterias and buildings 
considered unusable did not collapse and may have been relatively safe had they 
been occupied during the quake, said Bonnie James, the district's director of 
building design and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Unusable' does not mean 'unsafe,' " said James, who stressed that district 
officials have not completed their analysis of damaged structures. "We have 
cracked walls, (fallen) plaster, fallen ceiling tiles. We have buckled floors, 
broken windows, damaged ceilings (and damaged) air-conditioning vents. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) all of our buildings are standing. To our knowledge -- and we have not 
had any structural engineers say differently -- we have had no buildings fail 
to the point where students would not have been (safe)." 
</P>
<P>
 James said officials know of no classrooms or buildings where heavy sections 
of ceiling fell, although in some cases light fixtures dropped and gas lines 
broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspection reports showed that at many schools, portable classrooms shifted 
off their foundations during the quake. In several instances, damage was 
reported to the supports of arcades that provide cover for outdoor eating areas 
and shade over walkways. Gas and heating problems were found more than half the 
schools that remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Gary McGavin, a member of the California Seismic Safety Commission, 
visited more than a dozen of the damaged school sites in the Valley and 
concluded that in some locations, poorly maintained arcades could have injured 
or killed students. McGavin said heavy ovens and other unsecured equipment 
tended to bounce around cafeteria kitchens, ripping gas and utility lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as teams of building engineers, architects and inspectors continued to go 
from site to site, state officials raised questions about whether all the 
schools could be repaired and returned to use. "By far the majority (of the 
known damage) is non-structural," said Joe McRonald, who is coordinating a 
damage evaluation for the state architect's office. "Most likely (the 
buildings) can be cleaned up and reused." 
</P>
<P>
 But a few schools suffered "very serious damage," he said. Officials said 
eight schools near the Northridge epicenter would remain closed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspection reports obtained Monday identified 102 unusable classrooms at El 
Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills, where the auditorium and cafeteria 
were declared unfit for use. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kennedy High School in Granada Hills, 100 classrooms were found unusable. 
The auditorium, cafeteria and main office all were uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby Van Gogh Street Elementary School, also in Granada Hills, fared no 
better. "Entire site structurally unsafe," a report noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Granada Hills campuses suffered substantial damage: Robert Frost 
Middle School and Danube Avenue Elementary School. Ernest Lawrence Middle 
School in Chatsworth lost the use of its auditorium, cafeteria and 34 
classrooms. Castlebay Lane Elementary School in Northridge lost the use of its 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Middle School lost the use of 50 classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools that are closed today may reopen later this week or soon 
afterward, officials said. Overall, more than half of the district's 640 
campuses were virtually unscathed by the quake, and some were only partially 
unusable. District officials scrambled throughout the past week to allow 
students to return to many campuses this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Understanding the full scope of the temblor's impact on schools may take time, 
McRonald said. He stressed that it is too early to say whether the destruction 
will force changes in California building codes for schools -- more stringent 
than the structural standards for virtually any other type of building. 
</P>
<P>
 At this time, he said, "everyone feels comfortable with the standards." 
</P>
<P>
 Duwayne Brooks, director of school facilities planning for the state 
Department of Education, agreed. "There were (no buildings) that absolutely 
collapsed and every district has said the same thing," she said. "The Field Act 
works." 
</P>
<P>
 The Field Act, enacted in 1933, was one of the first responses to the 
devastating 1933 Long Beach quake, in which a number of school buildings were 
seriously damaged. Named after Southern California Assemblyman C. Don Field, 
the measure initially applied only to new school construction. It was not until 
the 1960s that state law required older schools to be brought up to modern 
seismic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Field Act virtually stopped the construction of unreinforced masonry 
schools and that in and of itself was a tremendous improvement," said L. Thomas 
Tobin, executive director of the state Seismic Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, often as a result of damage left by a major quake, school 
standards have been upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of California schools are our safest buildings," Tobin 
said. "There are some that are not so safe." 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, a number of school districts re-examined 
buildings, especially those built close to major faults, and some districts 
shut down selected facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But a measure to require the state architect's office to do a systematic 
review of buildings constructed before the 1970s died in the Legislature. So it 
has been left to each district to look at its own buildings and take whatever 
corrective action is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of last week's quake, particularly the unexpectedly strong vertical 
thrusts, caused some engineers to question the adequacy of the Field Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the Field Act was designed to deal with the majority of quakes, which 
are horizontal," said the state Department of Education's Henry Heydt. "One of 
the questions is whether (the vertical movement standards) need to be 
upgraded." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael), a civil engineer, is promising hearings to 
review school building standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene said it is not possible to build an earthquake-proof building. "There 
is no perfection in design in terms of resisting earthquakes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if weaknesses in building codes are uncovered, Greene said a major 
obstacle to upgrading schools still remains: lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing new schools to house an additional 150,000 to 190,000 students a 
year in the state and replacing older buildings will cost $2.5 billion a year, 
Greene said. The lawmaker is carrying bills to ask voters to approve $2 billion 
in school construction bonds this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But to upgrade schools to the highest earthquake-resistance standards will 
take even more, Greene said. "You can't just fix things that are broken," he 
said. "That just gets you back to where you are. If the same thing happened 
again, you'd get the same result. What we want is to improve our knowledge and 
improve our preparation for an earthquake."

COLUMN ONE; CRIME HITS HARD ON CAPITOL HILL; ONE SENATOR'S WIFE FLED A GUNMAN. 
OTHER LAWMAKERS HAVE BEEN MUGGED, STALKED OR ROBBED. FOR MANY IN CONGRESS, 
VIOLENCE HAS STRUCK CLOSE TO HOME, STEELING RESOLVE TO PASS TOUGH LAWS.

 "A fellow with a .45 automatic put a gun to my wife's head and said, 'We're 
leaving in your car,' " recalled Kent Conrad, relating a horrifying episode 
that unfolded two years ago in front of his home a few blocks from the U.S. 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad rushed out of the house, but the assailant, a convicted rapist serving 
the end of his term in a halfway house, waved him back inside with his gun. 
Then the gunman dragged Lucy Conrad two blocks before she managed to escape, 
bruised and shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conrads are more than just another statistic in the rising spiral of urban 
violence. Kent Conrad is a Democratic senator from North Dakota, and that puts 
him in a position to do more than just complain that crime is mounting 
uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am ready to do something very serious about crime," Conrad told the Senate 
recently. "We have to get tough. People who commit violence need to be put away 
and need to be separated from the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad is one of a growing number of lawmakers whose personal experiences are 
a major force in forging a more hard-line stance on crime in both the Senate 
and the House. With dozens of legislators, their families and aides sharing the 
experiences of victims across the country, Congress seems likely to pass the 
most comprehensive crime bill in history by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Senate debated such legislation in November, members made clear that 
their determination to do something about violent criminals extended beyond the 
strong public call for action and intense media attention that the issue had 
attracted. They also spoke solemnly about family members or close friends who 
had been victims of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of members (of Congress) and staff people who have been mugged has 
created a sense of urgency in dealing with crime," said Rep. Chet Atkins 
(D-Mass.), who was robbed at gunpoint in 1988 in front of the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 What emerged from the Senate was the most sweeping and costly crime-fighting 
bill in history. The measure, adopted by a 95-4 vote, would set aside $22.3 
billion to put 100,000 more police officers on the street, build more prisons 
and stiffen sentences for using a gun in a crime. The House will take up the 
Senate-passed bill shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters are demanding action. In a just-completed Los Angeles Times Poll, 90% 
of respondents said that crime was a "very serious" problem for the nation. And 
a recent poll by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News found that 76% of those 
surveyed favored mandatory life sentences for repeat violent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 As if they needed any more reminders, the personal experiences of lawmakers 
brought that message home in a compelling way. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitol Hill, the neighborhood of stately turn-of-the-century townhouses where 
many legislators live, is close to some of Washington's poorest and most 
violent areas. It's a combination that makes this neighborhood a hotbed of 
crime that draws national media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 In one particularly bloody episode only blocks from the Capitol, then-Rep. Bob 
Traxler (D-Mich.) was clubbed unconscious and robbed of $8 in the spring of 
1992 as he was walking to his car. Like other violent crimes involving members 
of Congress or their aides, Traxler's mugging received far more attention than 
any of the two dozen robberies that occur on an average day in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 slaying of Tom Barnes, an assistant to Sen. Richard C. Shelby 
(D-Ala.), also drew national attention. Barnes' murder -- he was shot while 
walking to a convenience store near his Capitol Hill home -- sparked a movement 
to authorize a death penalty in Washington. Voters rejected the proposal in a 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder of another congressional aide, Abbey McCloskey, in the same 
neighborhood that year also drew demands for additional anti-crime legislation. 
Her killer was the first person sentenced in the District of Columbia to life 
in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 So common has street crime become here that Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa 
Barbara) did not bother to tell police after he was robbed on a northwest 
Washington street last May. Huffington disclosed the episode eight months after 
it occurred, brushing it aside as insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the grand scheme of things, this didn't seem that important," Huffington 
said. "I mean, there's rape, there's murder . . . there's a lot worse things 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Important or not, Huffington said, the episode had a searing impact on his own 
way of looking at crime. "Every time I read a newspaper about another crime, it 
just makes me madder," he told States News Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers have special protection from the Capitol Police force, whose 1,200 
officers keep close watch on their homes. Nonetheless, many acknowledged that a 
growing fear of becoming a crime victim has caused them to change their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now do not go to the automatic teller after dark," said Senate Judiciary 
Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), a main author of the 
Senate-passed crime bill. "My wife tells me we are not going to do the shopping 
on Friday nights anymore. . . . It is unsafe for my mom (in Delaware) to walk 
out into the parking lot of the shopping center in my middle-class 
neighborhood, and I have to do something that changes that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) has been a hawk on the crime issue since his son, 
Gray, and his daughter, Elizabeth, witnessed the murder of a 16-year-old girl 
during a $20 robbery at a bank teller machine near Vanderbilt University in 
Nashville last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the first on the scene to give her aid and comfort," Sasser said. 
"They came home and told their mother and myself the story, and I think every 
parent would know the fear and anger that I felt at that moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to bring this nightmare to an end. We need a blueprint to put more 
police on the streets, to take back our neighborhoods from the hoodlums, from 
the thugs, from the murderers, to put the violent among us behind bars and to 
try to deter our young people from taking the first wrong step to a life of 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think there is anybody here who is soft on crime," said Sen. John 
Kerry (D-Mass.), noting that FBI statistics indicate 83% of Americans can 
expect to be a crime victim. Kerry, a former prosecutor, has suffered three car 
thefts and a break-in at his Washington home. 
</P>
<P>
 But his most vivid memory is of the night recently when he was walking along 
the street a block and a half from the White House. A car screeched past him 
and someone inside threw a beer bottle that broke at his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I yelled at them, then realized I made a mistake," Kerry said. "They drove 
around the corner, stopped and started backing up. I walked into a restaurant. 
. . . The car drove up and I saw them glaring at me. I am confident if I stayed 
out on the street, I might be a statistic today." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar experience was recounted by Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.), who said 
that he and his son, Christopher, were menaced on a Washington street by young 
men in a car with darkened windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car made a quick U-turn and started coming over to our side of the road," 
Cohen said. "They were about to pile out and attack the two of us. The only 
thing that stopped them from doing so is that we happened to be walking by a 
building with a security guard standing outside who was armed. Once they 
spotted the security guard, they got back into the car and took off." 
</P>
<P>
 Crimes against members of Congress are not new. In 1978, two men beat and 
robbed Rep. Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), who was then the House minority whip, 
behind his home on Capitol Hill. Michel, who fought back, suffered cuts on his 
head and face, requiring seven stitches on his tongue, and a fractured rib. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two weeks earlier, then-Sen. Robert Morgan (D-N.C.) was robbed of 
$300 by three teen-agers while window shopping in downtown Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But the frequency of these Capitol crimes has increased along with the 
explosion of violence in schools and drive-by shootings that have sent the 
Washington homicide rate soaring to record rates in recent years. Crime and 
violence grew so bad last year that Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly asked President 
Clinton for permission to use the National Guard to help the police control the 
streets of the District of Columbia. Clinton refused the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Few lawmakers have been closer to violent crime than freshman Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein (D-Calif.), who became mayor of San Francisco after the assassination 
of her predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Senate debate on crime legislation, she told how she learned to use 
a gun after terrorists tried to bomb her San Francisco home and shot out her 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, a man accused of stalking Feinstein while she was mayor was 
convicted in September of violating a court order to stay at least 150 yards 
away from her, her staff, her home and her office. Michael Magday had served 
six years in prison for weapon violations when he was arrested in 1981 outside 
San Francisco City Hall with a loaded shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes an encounter with crime can pay unexpected political dividends. Rep. 
Mike Synar (D-Okla.), returning from a morning jog a few years ago, discovered 
a burglar in his Capitol Hill home. When the culprit leaped from a second-floor 
window to make his escape, Synar gave chase, climbing fences and running 
through alleys as he urged his neighbors to call 911. Finally, with the aid of 
a 17-year-old ally, Synar tackled the burglar and held him until police 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Synar said he asked himself afterward: "What are you doing? Are you crazy? He 
might have had a weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 His exploit proved beneficial back in Oklahoma, where he had been pictured by 
critics as soft on crime. Said Synar: "It solved that problem overnight."

NEW ROUTES, HABITS HELP AREA TRAFFIC SYSTEM PASS INITIAL TEST; COMMUTE: NETWORK 
OF DETOURS AND HIGH RIDERSHIP ON METROLINK EASE CONGESTION. BUT OFFICIALS WARN 
THAT START OF SCHOOL AND MORE MOTORISTS COULD OVERLOAD ROADS.

 Transportation officials applauded the emergence of an uneasy new equilibrium 
on Los Angeles streets and freeways Monday, saying a patchwork of detours and 
commuters' willingness to break old habits had kept traffic flowing grudgingly 
just a week after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our commuters here in Los Angeles are innovative and resilient. They react 
and they respond well to a crisis," said Jerry B. Baxter, Caltrans district 
director. "If they hadn't responded, we would have had mass, mass confusion and 
tie-ups." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, officials said Monday's commute was far from normal and they warned 
that drives from the Santa Clarita Valley and the Westside toward Downtown 
could still be tied in knots in coming days. Facing drivers will be the 
reopening of schools, the expected arrival of rain and the return to work of an 
untold number of commuters who have so far remained on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear how many of the 5.6 million drivers who usually traverse county 
highways and freeways stayed off the road Monday, on what had been billed as 
the first full commuter day since the 6.6-magnitude Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a settling-in period that is most of this week," said Tom Conner, 
assistant general manager of the city's Department of Transportation. "We are 
going to need some real behavioral shifts for it all to work out." 
</P>
<P>
 In other post-earthquake developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Seventy-six schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District remain closed 
today, nearly all of them in the West San Fernando Valley. About 65,000 
students who attend the closed schools will have to stay home until alternative 
plans are made, possibly relocation to another campus. The district will make 
announcements daily on additional campus openings. 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of buildings declared at least partially uninhabitable in the 
city of Los Angeles jumped to 4,322, encompassing a total of 14,576 housing 
units. Officials said damage to buildings in Los Angeles was approaching $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it had taken 40,000 
applications for aid and issued checks totaling $1,766,400 to 1,100 families. 
</P>
<P>
 * President Clinton planned to announce today that he will waive a federal law 
that requires state and local governments to pick up 25% of the cost of 
repairing roads, schools and other facilities damaged in natural disaster. 
Under the waiver, the federal government would pick up 90% of those costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is expected to ask for an aid package of more than $5 billion, up from 
the earlier estimates of between $4 billion and $5 billion. The exact number 
remains in doubt as damage estimates continue to change. U.S. Transportation 
Secretary Federico Pena, still in Los Angeles on Monday to help with recovery 
efforts, estimated that $1 billion may go to transportation repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters in the two hardest-hit corridors -- the Santa Monica Freeway and the 
intersection of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways -- seemed to have 
reached a tenuous accommodation with their new circumstances Monday. But the 
evening commute had bogged down badly with backups of nine miles and up to two 
hours to get through the Newhall Pass into the Santa Clarita Valley and 
half-an-hour delays in reaching the Westside from Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Most drivers on alternates to the closed Santa Monica Freeway, linking the 
Westside and Downtown, said they were delayed 15 to 30 minutes. Motorists were 
experimenting with a variety of east-west alternatives, from Wilshire and 
Olympic boulevards in the north, to Adams and Jefferson boulevards south of the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected worse, given what I was hearing on car radio," said Donn Ehrlich, 
a fashion designer, of his trip to the Mid-City area. "I'm just going to have 
to get up earlier and get out earlier to make good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were less sanguine. "It's bad, it's real bad but it's moving," said 
Alexandria Morris, after picking up her daughter and stopping for gas near 
Robertson Boulevard Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's busiest freeway should receive a boost this morning with the 
opening of car-pool lanes in both directions, transportation officials said. 
The lanes will allow buses and cars with two or more riders to stay on the 
damaged freeway for about a mile longer and to take detours half the length of 
those riding in single-passenger cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The detours will be able to handle about one-quarter of the volume normally 
provided by the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The striping of the freeway to create the new car-pool lanes, ironically, 
created one of Monday's greatest traffic snarls. Several lanes on the westbound 
Santa Monica Freeway were closed for the morning, leading to a three-mile 
backup and as much as a half-hour delay. But the roadway had been returned to 
its previous La Brea Avenue-to-Robertson Boulevard closure by midday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials attributed the manageable commutes on the Westside in part to "very 
heavy" loads on MTA buses along several Westside-to-Downtown lines. 
</P>
<P>
 But ridership on express routes is still lagging. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Municipal Bus Lines reported that ridership on its No. 10 express 
had not returned to normal levels. And the MTA had fewer than 30 riders on a 
new line it created between Downtown and Pacific Palisades. Some of the nine 
buses leaving a beach parking lot at Temescal Canyon Road and Pacific Coast 
Highway did not have a single rider. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bottlenecked Golden State Freeway from the Santa Clarita Valley, cars 
were moving at relatively speedy 30 m.p.h. for much of the morning, compared to 
last week's gridlock. After 7 a.m., the pace had slowed so that it took up to 
an hour and 15 minutes to traverse the Newhall Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Any improvement over last week was due in large part to the increasing number 
of train commuters into the heart of Los Angeles, said Edward G. LaFond, an 
assistant chief with the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink train ridership reached an all-time high of 25,000 Monday, up from a 
pre-quake peak of 10,000. Leading the jump is the now bustling Santa Clarita 
Valley route, which had an estimated 16,000 riders Monday, compared to 13,000 
Friday and just 1,000 before the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials had added 1,000 parking spaces at the Santa Clarita 
station and another 1,000 spaces are available at the new Palmdale and 
Lancaster stations. And more expansions were promised: 
</P>
<P>
 The partially built Sylmar-San Fernando station is scheduled to open Wednesday 
at Hubbard Street and San Fernando Road, although there will be no parking 
there for now. On Thursday, the Lancaster-Los Angeles line will add another 
stop south of Palmdale near the Antelope Valley Freeway and Angeles Forest 
Highway interchange, where Navy Seabees are working feverishly on an 
800-parking-space station. Next, Metrolink officials plan on adding a station 
in the north end of the Santa Clarita Valley, to complement the existing 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials were jubilant about the public's sudden enthusiasm 
for train travel, and they were hopeful for more community spirit on other 
fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 Car-pooling assistance organizations have reported a mixed response from the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter Transportation Services said inquiries about car-pooling had jumped 
to 500 a day, a fivefold increase. However, officials with Team Rideshare -- a 
Caltrans-funded organization that helps companies set up car-pool programs -- 
say they have not experienced any increase in calls since the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses are just beginning to react to Mayor Richard Riordan's call for 
altered work schedules, ride-sharing and for trucking companies to send their 
deliveries at night. A similar plan reduced peak-hour truck traffic by 14% 
during the 1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwindale-based Home Savings & Loan officials dispatched two rented vans 
Monday to pick up workers who had taken Metrolink commuter trains to Glendale. 
"People are happy we are just finding a solution for them," said Monica Price, 
a transportation coordinator for the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 At Arco, with 4,000 employees in the county, executives are considering 
whether to adopt a staggered workweek at several facilities, said spokesman 
Albert Greenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Express delivery officials vowed to cooperate "if a special directive 
is issued." But a United Parcel Service spokeswoman said that off-hour 
deliveries could crimp business. "Many customers are paying a premium for 
delivery at special times -- we are not able to choose delivery times," said 
spokeswoman Gina Ellrich. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the mayor's appeal, Lockheed Corp. executives offered their 5,000 
employees in Los Angeles County flexible work schedules, including four-day, 
10-hour workweeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly on Monday joined Riordan's call, passing a resolution urging 
state, local and federal agencies and departments to adopt staggered and 
flexible work hours for non-emergency-related employees to help relieve traffic 
congestion caused by the Northridge earthquake. The resolution, authored by 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), now goes to the Senate.

<P>
 Navigating the quake-mangled freeway system will take planning and 
perseverance, probably for many months to come. Here are the major road 
closures and some alternate routes: 
</P>
<P>
 A one-way southbound lane will be opened later in the week at Sepulveda 
Boulevard between San Fernando Road and the Golden State Freeway on ramp at 
Roxford Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning today, the shortest westbound detour will be reserved for car pools 
and buses only. Non-car-poolers headed west will need to take the La 
Brea-to-Pico-to-Robertson detour. To ease congestion on the major east-west 
streets, officials are instituting a computerized system known as the "smart 
corridor." The boulevards involved are Pico, Washington, Venice and Adams.

COURT ALLOWS ABORTION SUITS UNDER RICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court gave abortion providers a new legal weapon Monday by ruling 
that militant foes of abortion can be forced to pay crippling damage verdicts 
if they are found to have led a campaign of violence and threats against 
abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-0 decision reinstates a lawsuit filed by the National Organization for 
Women against Joseph Scheidler and his Pro-Life Action League, and Randall 
Terry and his Operation Rescue. The suit charges the abortion opponents with 
leading a nationwide conspiracy to shut abortion clinics through bombings, 
arson, break-ins and threats. 
</P>
<P>
 If the charges are proven, the high court said, Scheidler and his allies 
violated the federal anti-racketeering law and can be required to pay damages 
three times greater than the total losses suffered by the abortion providers. 
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, the ruling also gives government prosecutors the power to use 
the law against any terrorist organization that uses violence for political 
reasons. Similarly, it would permit lawsuits against animal rights activists, 
environmental extremists or others who use force or violence to achieve their 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Most lower courts have dismissed such suits on the grounds that the Racketeer 
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act applies only to mobsters, crooks or 
con artists who prey on legitimate business. Since the abortion foes acted for 
moral reasons, not for "an economic motive," a federal appeals court in Chicago 
had dismissed NOW's suit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, concluded that 
the 1970 law does not require that criminals be motivated by money. 
</P>
<P>
 The law covers "any enterprise . . . individual (or) association" which 
engages in a pattern of criminal activity, such as robbery, murder, arson, 
fraud, drug dealing or the use of violence and threatened force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowhere in (the language of the law) is there any indication that an economic 
motive is required," Rehnquist said. A targeted group "need only be an 
association in fact that engages in a pattern of racketeering activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's ruling is also noteworthy because the legal outcome is not 
necessarily in line with the personal preferences of the justices. Several of 
them, including Rehnquist, have repeatedly expressed concern about the broad 
reach of the RICO law. While the justices have urged Congress to amend the law, 
they have also said that they have no authority to rewrite it on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally enacted as a weapon to combat organized crime, during the 1980s the 
law became a favored means of attacking regular businesses that engaged in 
fraud. The targets included the executives of failed thrift institutions, 
stockbrokers who deceived customers, city officials who took bribes, even 
accountants, travel agents and insurance sellers who put their names on 
misleading statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics now say that the law has become a dangerous tool in the hands of 
greedy lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices could have invoked the First Amendment and ruled that a 
racketeering suit such as the one in this case violates the free-speech rights 
of abortion foes. But as Rehnquist noted in his opinion in the case (NOW vs. 
Scheidler, 92-780), lawyers for abortion foes did not raise that issue in this 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Given previous interpretations of the RICO law, attorneys for Operation Rescue 
presumably thought that they could win without a First Amendment argument. Now, 
however, as the case returns for trial in Chicago, the anti-abortion leaders 
are free to argue that their activities are protected as free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the justices also announced that they would review a Florida 
judge's order that limited anti-abortion picketing near a clinic. A ruling in 
that case, due by July, should clarify the free-speech rights of the abortion 
foes. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of NOW praised Monday's decision and predicted that it could help 
quell the "escalating anti-abortion terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision allows us to go after the leaders, the kingpins of this 
conspiracy," said Helen Neuborne, executive director of the NOW Legal Defense 
Fund. "We believe we can connect them to these bombings and the other acts of 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-abortion lawyers denounced the decision and said they feared that it "may 
bankrupt not only pro-life organizations but other political activists 
throughout the nation," said Clarke Forsythe, general counsel for Americans 
United for Life, who represented Scheidler. Defending itself in the 8-year-old 
case has already cost Pro-Life Action League more than $1 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect a costly abuse of RICO . . . will threaten all activists that 
oppose various businesses," Forsythe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the House and Senate have passed bills that would make it a federal crime 
to block the entrances to an abortion facility. A final version of that 
legislation is expected to gain congressional approval by spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion rights lawyers said that the new measure would permit authorities, 
including federal judges, to intervene against ordinary protesters who break 
the law. Last year, the Supreme Court stripped federal judges of their power to 
intervene in these disputes by ruling that federal civil rights laws do not 
protect women seeking abortion.

PERRY, PENTAGON DEPUTY, IS NAMED DEFENSE SECRETARY; CABINET: CLINTON NOMINATES 
AN EXPERT ON TECHNOLOGY AND PROCUREMENT -- BUT WITH UNTESTED POLITICAL SKILLS. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton on Monday nominated Deputy Defense Secretary William J. 
Perry, a respected administrator with largely untested political skills, to 
take over the Pentagon's top position. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton praised the 66-year-old expert in defense technology and procurement 
as "a real pro," saying that "he has the right skills and management experience 
for the job. He has the right vision for the job." 
</P>
<P>
 And Perry, who served as a high-level Pentagon official in the Jimmy Carter 
Administration and has broad experience in business and academia, comes with 
strong support from the military, from Congress and from defense industries. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, his nomination is expected to win easy confirmation in the 
Senate, apparently ending an embarrassingly public struggle to find a 
replacement for the present defense chief, Les Aspin. The nine-week melodrama 
saw retired Adm. Bobby Ray Inman accept, then reject the nomination, and two 
other candidates, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and 
former Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.) tell the White House that they were not 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
 But it remains to be seen whether Perry, a loyal, soft-spoken member of the 
Administration team, can meet the White House's other urgent need at Defense -- 
for a forceful leader who can blunt criticism of the national security team and 
build public support for difficult policy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In an afternoon press conference, Clinton sought to underscore the scope of 
Perry's experience, citing his work on the Stealth program, procurement reform 
and the defense budget, as well as his contribution to the recent agreement 
with the Ukrainian government to eliminate its nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry has been on the "cutting edge of defense issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the President put a positive face on the announcement, the search for a 
defense secretary had become a particularly thorny issue since Aspin's 
departure was first contemplated last Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid widespread criticism of its handling of foreign policy, lingering 
disquiet within the armed services about the President's draft record and 
continuing controversy over the policy on gays in the military, the 
Administration hoped to find a candidate with enough star quality to buffer it 
against future attacks -- particularly from conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House thought Inman could provide those qualities and some aides 
believed that Nunn or Rudman could. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with Perry, the White House believes it has found a steady managerial 
hand and it hopes that he will develop into a public presence, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton tried Monday to dismiss suggestions that this selection -- like so 
many earlier ones -- had been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an interview with one person," Clinton said. "I asked him if he would 
take the job, and he did. I don't think that qualifies as difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, who has been, in effect, the department's operations manager under 
Aspin, acknowledged that the national security problems facing the country in 
the aftermath of the Cold War are "complex and difficult." And he said he had 
nearly turned down the job offer on Saturday because of his family's hesitation 
about the loss of privacy and potential criticism that could come with such a 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry met with Clinton Friday morning to talk about the job, then spent Friday 
evening discussing the promotion with his wife, Lee, and five children. On 
Saturday morning, when he was to meet White House Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) 
McLarty, the family was still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, if I had to accept the job at that time, my answer would have to 
be no," he told reporters at the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perry said that he met with Vice President Al Gore at Gore's home in 
Washington and Gore urged him to take more time. By Sunday afternoon, he called 
Gore back and told him: "If you still want me for your secretary of defense, 
I'm eager to serve." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Brown, Perry's boss as secretary of defense under Carter, said that 
Perry talked to him over the weekend and confided his concern about the 
criticism that might be aimed at him in the post. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody likes to get shot at, especially if he's a low-key person," Brown 
said. "He saw me get shot at -- he saw Les Aspin get shot at." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Perry said that the decision to move up was also difficult 
because in his current job as the Pentagon's No. 2 official he has been able to 
pursue his key interests -- in defense technology and procurement, for example 
-- without having to spend a lot of time as the defense agency's public 
spokesman, a role he does not particularly relish. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of defense post is difficult in the best of times. Perry would 
inherit it at a particularly trying moment. Amid strict budgetary constraints, 
he would oversee an anguishing downsizing of the 1.6-million-member armed 
services, manage new policies toward women and homosexual members, reform 
procurement and reshape security policies at a time when the nature of future 
defense needs is unclear and the nation is deeply divided on how broadly its 
security umbrella should be spread. 
</P>
<P>
 The complexity of those tasks apparently tripped up Aspin, despite his long 
years as one of the most powerful congressional overseers of the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did Perry devote much time to broader defense policy-making issues either 
during his time at the Pentagon during the Carter years or in his current tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Perry's nomination was praised by lawmakers ranging from Sen. 
Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), ranking minority member of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, to Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), one of the senior members of 
the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Cheney, secretary of defense under former President George Bush, said 
that Perry has an "excellent reputation" and is "very knowledgeable about 
defense matters," adding that it would be "vital for him to stand up to the 
President and the White House on defense matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those who praised Perry Monday focused on his skills in management and 
procurement, while others pointed to his experience as a defense strategist. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's nomination to be deputy defense secretary was approved unanimously by 
the Senate last March and lawmakers do not foresee any obstacles this time 
around.

ALL BUT 76 L.A. SCHOOLS TO OPEN DESPITE JITTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 All but 76 campuses in the Los Angeles Unified School District will reopen 
today as the nation's second-largest school district labors to restore normalcy 
for more than half a million quake-jittery youths after an unprecedented 
weeklong emergency break. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the closed campuses are in the hard-hit West San Fernando 
Valley, and school officials are scrambling to open even some of those schools 
before the end of the week. About 65,000 students who attend the closed schools 
will have to stay home until alternative plans are made, including possible 
relocation to another campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will make announcements daily on additional school openings. 
Supt. Sid Thompson said Monday that he and the Board of Education decided to 
reopen West Valley schools on a day-to-day basis rather than keep them all 
closed for the remainder of the week because "we've made it a priority that 
these kids need to be in school." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want our students who have missed school for a week to please know that 
their education is our No. 1 concern," said Thompson, adding that schools will 
adjust exam schedules and will likely make up lost time by lengthening the 
school day or year. 
</P>
<P>
 He said about 50 of the 76 schools are closed because of lack of utilities but 
anticipates that services will be restored quickly so that those campuses can 
reopen by Friday. About eight schools have suffered severe damage and are 
closed indefinitely. Officials hope to open safe sections of other schools as 
soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 All school operations are subject to last-minute changes if significant 
aftershocks cause additional damage or cuts in utilities, officials said. 
Parents are asked to call their schools for more information. 
</P>
<P>
 Updated lists of school closures will be shown on the school district's 
television station, KLCS Channel 58, on a continuous basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who are bused to school should meet their buses at the same time and 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators and classified employees at the closed schools are to report to 
work today to assist with parent questions and continued cleanup. Teachers, 
many without a classroom to work in, can stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the sprawling district Monday, faculty and staff met for the first 
time since the magnitude 6.6 quake badly pounded half of the district's 640 
schools, causing damages estimated to run as high as $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Eastside to Northridge, school employees reviewed and revised their 
emergency evacuation plans to be prepared in case significant aftershocks hit 
during the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 They organized staff search-and-rescue teams, first-aid stations and parent 
pickup sites. Teachers will make sure there is plenty of space inside their 
classrooms for every child to "drop and hold" beneath their desks -- a drill 
they say is often the brunt of student jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there will be a whole new attitude and awareness over the drops now," 
said University High School teacher Patty Peisner. 
</P>
<P>
 At senior high schools, teachers voted to postpone finals scheduled to start 
today, a temporary relief to thousands of students who have been too nervous to 
study. Teachers cleaned their classrooms, custodians finished sweeping rooms 
and administrators dealt with bus routes, cafeteria openings and final campus 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 At all campuses, teachers -- many nervous themselves -- will take time to 
allow students to share their feelings about the quake. Crisis counseling teams 
have been assembled at most schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at her desk in Room 3 at Balboa Boulevard Gifted/High Ability Magnet 
in Northridge, teacher Emily Taitz flipped through a book titled "Earthquakes" 
and prepared a lesson for her second-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to talk about it, we're going to write about it, we're going to 
draw pictures -- we'll probably write books called 'The Day the Earth Shook,' " 
Taitz said. "We need to get back to a routine because that's what gives kids 
security." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathie Aihara, who also teaches second grade at Balboa, echoed concerns of 
teachers throughout the city about coping with aftershocks. "A lot of it will 
depend on the way their parents are dealing with it," Aihara said. "If their 
parents have been very panicky and upset about every aftershock, then I'm sure 
the kids will be too." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students, especially in the Valley, will return to safe but bare-bones 
conditions in classrooms where a semester's worth of supplies and projects may 
have been damaged or lost. 
</P>
<P>
 All extracurricular activities, including clubs, sports and field trips, have 
been canceled or postponed this week. Districtwide meetings have also been 
called off. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials are expecting attendance to be low in the Valley, while 
other parts of the sprawling system, such as the Harbor area, are gearing up 
for full classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Drops and fluctuations in enrollment can also be expected because of the 
thousands of homeless and displaced families. "We've told principals not to 
hesitate, just enroll children as they come in," said Assistant Supt. Sally 
Coughlin, who oversees Valley elementary schools. "We're going to have enormous 
changes in student population." 
</P>
<P>
 The district also is considering bus service to shuttle homeless students from 
parks and shelters to their local schools, but plans have not been finalized, 
Coughlin said. The nine Red Cross shelters on district campuses will remain in 
operation even with students on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for reopening schools today, district officials and Red Cross 
workers urged families informally camping on school fields and playgrounds to 
move to official tent cities and shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although district officials had feared that many Valley teachers would not 
report to work because of personal troubles related to the quake, Coughlin does 
not expect high absenteeism. On Monday, she had to only call in 39 substitutes, 
lower than the 50-plus usually needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those teachers whose schools are indefinitely closed found comfort in 
being back in class temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been kind of therapeutic, getting things back together and doing 
this physical work," said Kay Krattli, after picking up volumes of books in the 
Frost Middle School library. "We're all having trouble focusing on anything for 
a period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students also are eager to restore routine in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want everything to move on now. I want to get on with things," said 
Sue-Jean Chang, 17, of Northridge, who attends Bravo Medical Magnet School on 
the Eastside and is not fazed by the long commute to school with a friend. "I'm 
just getting kind of worried about my classes. Everything has been thrown off 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Chang, like thousands of other seniors, is enrolled in advanced placement 
courses with national tests this spring. She said she is hoping that her 
teachers will offer extra tutoring to help her make up for missed study time. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two of the district's charter schools, which are semi-autonomous 
operations, resumed class Monday, offering a preview of the struggles that lie 
ahead today. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fenton, which sustained significant cosmetic but no structural damage in 
the quake, only about 100 of nearly 775 students showed up for the first full 
day of class. Principal Joseph Lucente attributed the low turnout to 
miscommunication. 
</P>
<P>
 At Vaughn Next Century Learning Center in Pacoima, slightly more than half the 
700 students arrived for the first of two consecutive half-days. Some of the 47 
newly homeless students dressed for school in the parking lots, cars or parks 
where they are living. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy and sad," said 10-year-old Arnulfo Villalobos, who is sleeping in a 
parking lot with his parents, brothers, nieces and nephews. "If the Big One 
comes and my family dies, I want to be over there with them when they die." 
</P>
<P>
 But Faviola Rangel, a 12-year-old, said she felt safer at school than at her 
grandmother's house, where she moved when her family's Pacoima apartment was 
destroyed by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just staying in the house I get scared," Faviola said. "I wanted to come to 
school." 
</P>

contributed to this story. Closed Schools 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Monday, the Los Angeles Unified School District said 76 schools -- 
most in the West San Fernando Valley -- will not reopen today; parts of some of 
these campuses may be cleared for reopening later this week, and others may 
remain closed much longer. Closures include any magnet schools on the same 
campus. District officials will update the school closure list daily. Parents 
should call their child's school for more information.

BALLOT DRIVE TARGETS LOCAL SMOKING BANS; INITIATIVE: MEASURE SUPPORTED BY 
PHILIP MORRIS AND SOME RESTAURANT OWNERS WOULD INVALIDATE NO-SMOKING LAWS IN 
LOS ANGELES AND OTHER CITIES. TOBACCO INDUSTRY WANTS LOOSER STATEWIDE CONTROLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Philip Morris U.S.A., the nation's largest cigarette manufacturer, and some 
Los Angeles area restaurants plan to sponsor a November ballot initiative that 
would abolish local anti-smoking ordinances in California, The Times learned 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, called the California Uniform Tobacco Control Act, would place 
the responsibility for regulating smoking in the hands of the Legislature, and 
invalidate smoking bans in Los Angeles and more than 100 other cities and 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry long has sought a statewide smoking standard, ending the 
authority of cities and counties to regulate smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Stitzenberger of the Dolphin Group, a Los Angeles political consulting 
firm, said his firm had been hired to qualify the measure for the ballot and he 
expects to have a $1-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have every indication that Philip Morris will be a player," Stitzenberger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed initiative is similar to legislation supported by the tobacco 
industry and carried last year by Assemblyman Curtis Tucker (D-Inglewood). That 
bill, which stalled in the state Senate, also sought to preempt local 
government from regulating smoking and impose statewide regulations looser than 
those adopted by many localities. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the tobacco measure met Monday in an attempt to come up with a 
strategy for battling it. Chances are slim that they would have time to raise 
the money necessary to place a countermeasure on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's outrageous," Tony Najera of the American Lung Assn. of California said 
after reading the proposed initiative. "I have all the confidence that the 
voters will not be fooled by the desperate tactics of the tobacco industry." 
</P>
<P>
 In documents filed last week with the state attorney general, the proponent of 
the Uniform Tobacco Control Act is listed as Donna Maret-Fahrenholtz, a 
restaurant owner in Playa del Rey. Maret-Fahrenholtz, who could not be reached, 
has been involved in fights against local smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 Stitzenberger said he expects to receive donations from Los Angeles restaurant 
owners opposed to Los Angeles' smoking ban, and from a group of small 
restaurant and bar owners known as the California Business and Restaurant Assn. 
The California Restaurant Assn., the state's largest restaurant association, 
has called for a statewide smoking ban and is likely to oppose the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran consultant involved in the initiative industry said other tobacco 
companies and the industry-funded Tobacco Institute are not involved. "There is 
no other company involved with this" other than Philip Morris, said the 
consultant, who asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Philip Morris U.S.A., the tobacco arm of the food and 
tobacco conglomerate, did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the initiative, the Legislature would need a two-thirds vote to make any 
changes in smoking laws. Tobacco industry lobbyists are influential in 
Sacramento and cigarette manufacturers are heavy contributors to legislative 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 cities and counties in California have banned smoking in 
restaurants and at least 70 have prohibited smoking in all enclosed workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed initiative would permit smoking in 25% of the dining area of 
restaurants so long as they provide ventilation set forth in the initiative. 
The ventilation standards listed in the initiative are not designed to protect 
against the ill effects of second-hand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure also would permit smoking in bars, private offices, ventilated 
conference rooms, 25% of the seating areas in employee cafeterias, designated 
smoking lounges in workplaces, portions of bowling allies, hotel lobbies and 
conference rooms, card clubs and racetracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would permit business and restaurant owners to ban smoking in 
their establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general has 45 days to analyze the initiative, write a summary 
and give the measure a title. Once the measure has a title and summary, the 
proponents can begin gathering signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphin Group will have to rush to get the measure on the ballot because 
the secretary of state suggests that signatures for a measure headed for the 
November ballot be submitted by April 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure needs 385,000 valid signatures of registered voters, and 
Stitzenberger said he is negotiating with the two major California firms that 
gather petition signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd have to be very lucky to make the '94 ballot," Stitzenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the initiative does not qualify this year, he said, his company will 
attempt to place the measure on a 1996 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the politically influential Sacramento law firm of Nielsen & 
Merksamer, which represents Gov. Pete Wilson, wrote the measure. Wilson's 
campaign staff was unaware of the planned initiative.

 Stitzenberger said the initiative would clarify the situation in which 
individual cities and counties have created a complicated "patchwork quilt." 
"There is no level playing field" for businesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the measure is on the ballot, Stitzenberger said he believes he will 
obtain campaign money from the organizations that supported Tucker's bill, 
including the California Hotel and Motel Assn., California Manufacturers Assn., 
and perhaps the state Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a brutal assault on local control," said Assemblyman Terry Friedman 
(D-Brentwood), who carried a bill last year to ban smoking in virtually all 
indoor workplaces but was stalled in the Senate. "This would be a huge retreat 
just at a time when the evidence is overwhelming that secondhand smoke kills."

EPA RESCINDS ORDER, WON'T BLOCK STATE ROAD FUNDS; ENVIRONMENT: DISPUTE OVER 
SMOG PROGRAM IS DEFERRED. THE AGENCY RELENTS BECAUSE OF EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE. 
</P>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration retreated Monday from a threat to withhold hundreds 
of millions of dollars in federal highway aid to California because of a 
dispute over how to reform the state's automobile smog control program. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Gov. Pete Wilson, EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner said that 
because of the urgency of rebuilding damaged roads and restoring the California 
economy after the Northridge earthquake, she will cancel an administrative 
order that would have denied California about $800 million in federal highway 
construction aid starting this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Epstein, a political adviser to President Clinton who had sought a quick 
resolution of the smog program issue, said, "Obviously, we don't want to stop 
highway funding from coming into Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials said, however, that the smoggiest regions of California 
still do not meet federal clean air requirements and that sanctions will be 
imposed next year if an acceptable smog program is not implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 The action delays an impending clash between the Environmental Protection 
Agency and the state over reforming the program for checking automobile 
emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations between state and federal officials collapsed Jan. 7 when the 
agency announced it had started the process of imposing sanctions, including 
the cutoff of transportation funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to cancel the threat came almost immediately after the earthquake 
last week as officials met at the White House to determine how best to help the 
state recover, Administration officials in Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her letter, Browner told Wilson that the earthquake underscored the 
"importance of all levels of government working together to meet the health and 
safety needs of our constituents." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, she urged Wilson to veto a bill approved by the 
Legislature last week that would enhance the state's ability to check vehicles 
for smog-causing emissions. EPA officials have insisted that California 
separate Smog Check and repair facilities, a feature not included in the bill 
on Wilson's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that if (the bill) is set aside, that by working together, we can 
reach a sensible solution," Browner told Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman described Wilson as "gratified" that Browner had backed off, but 
said the governor still intends to sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, in Sacramento, Browner's action won general support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a goodwill gesture," said V. John White, a Sierra Club lobbyist 
who supports the EPA's position. "The imposition of sanctions seemed to drive 
people away from the negotiating table. I think EPA is using the pretext of the 
earthquake to send a more conciliatory signal." 
</P>
<P>
 White and others said that federal highway funds earmarked for health and 
safety are exempt from the EPA sanctions. Even so, he said, he believed for 
political reasons that the Clinton Administration had to cancel the threat of 
EPA administrative sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), a lead negotiator and architect of the 
California bill, said that "given the fact that the EPA has backed off, I think 
the appropriate response is to take another run at getting a solution. I think 
we can resolve it in a relatively short time." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who led an environmental fight against 
passage of the bill, said canceling the sanctions merely delayed the showdown 
for another day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means they are asking for the confrontation to be delayed in light of the 
earthquake," Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Browner separately noted that continued failure by California to comply 
with federal anti-smog standards would trigger a series of penalties mandated 
in federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that as of June, 1995, the law imposes new restrictions on industrial 
sources of air pollution that expand their facilities or move. Such 
restrictions are widely feared as potential inhibitors of economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, if California's smog program is still found unacceptable by the EPA 
in January, 1996, the law imposes automatic cuts in highway construction funds 
to the state, said Doug Eisinger, an EPA official in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the issue is EPA insistence that California's vehicle 
inspection and repair system be centralized. Currently, it is operated by 9,000 
garages and service stations statewide where mechanics perform both inspection 
and repair functions. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA maintains that the system is inefficient, too costly and contains an 
inherent conflict of interest for mechanics. Federal officials want repairs and 
inspections done at separate locations, an arrangement bitterly opposed by 
garage operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the EPA program, inspections would be performed by a centralized network 
of about 200 facilities. Repairs would be done elsewhere. 
</P>

 Times staff writers David Lauter in Washington and Daniel M. Weintraub in 
Sacramento contributed to this report.

NEWS ANALYSIS; ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE TURNS TOUGH; CRIME: THE 
ONCE-LIBERAL PANEL TOOK A BEATING IN THE NEWS MEDIA AFTER THE POLLY KLAAS 
MURDER. RECENTLY IT HAS APPROVED A SUCCESSION OF LAW-AND-ORDER BILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For conservative lawmakers, it is an oft-spoken adage -- the Assembly's 
Democrat-dominated Public Safety Committee is the killing field for legislation 
meant to clamp down on criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 But in these tough-on-crime times, the powerful panel has become a target of 
scorn from many quarters, and the longtime bastion of liberal views on criminal 
justice has shown signs of altering course. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of high-profile crimes such as the kidnaping and murder of 
12-year-old Polly Klaas in Northern California, newspaper columnists and 
editorial writers bludgeoned the panel in print. Radio talk show hosts heaped 
on ridicule. Criticism is likely to come next month at Gov. Pete Wilson's 
"crime summit" in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruised by the attacks and wary of alienating voters in an election year, 
members of the committee returned to Sacramento for the start of the 1994 
session and a majority promptly approved a succession of tough law-and-order 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting bills out I never thought we'd get out," said Assemblyman 
Richard K. Rainey (R-Walnut Creek), a former Contra Costa County sheriff and 
current committee member. "It's definitely a different year." 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the legislation that has survived safety committee scrutiny is a 
Rainey bill making it a felony for convicted sex offenders to avoid registering 
with police, and another once-stalled Republican measure toughening the state's 
pornography laws. Most notably, the panel approved several different versions 
of the headline-grabbing "three strikes and you're out" proposal, which would 
put repeat felons behind bars for life. Last year, the idea was waylaid in the 
public safety committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The string of GOP successes is largely the product of a key shift in the 
committee's power base with the recent addition of Assemblyman Mike Gotch, a 
moderate Democrat from San Diego. With Gotch aboard, the eight-member committee 
now has two Republicans and three moderate Democrats offsetting a trio of 
liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings an interesting new dynamic," said Assemblyman Ross Johnson 
(R-Placentia), a 15-year Assembly veteran who served on the committee during 
his first term. "How it will play out I'm just not sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans predict that once public attention turns away from crime, the 
committee will revert to its old ways. "We've got to strike while the iron is 
hot," Rainey said. "As soon as the heat is off, they'll go back to the way they 
were." 
</P>
<P>
 Rainey's words proved prophetic last week when the committee, acting like its 
old self, dashed a measure from one of the panel's own Democratic members. The 
bill by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) would have prohibited inmates 
imprisoned on a murder conviction from having overnight visits with spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that rebuff, Umberg remains hopeful the panel will take a harder line 
on crime. "This firestorm (of public opinion) has caused the Legislature to 
refocus and has hopefully changed some attitudes," Umberg said. "In my view, 
that's a positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Even moderates like Umberg, a former prosecutor planning a run for state 
attorney general, have felt the heat from those critical of the committee's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, a pair of radio talk show hosts on KFI-AM in Los Angeles 
spent several days whipping up their audience with discussion of the Klaas 
tragedy. Umberg and other members of the Public Safety Committee, they growled, 
had failed the electorate by refusing to approve the "three strikes" measure 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that the Legislature would have needed to pass such a law nearly a 
decade ago to snare Richard Allen Davis, the repeat felon accused of murdering 
Klaas while on parole after an eight-year stint behind bars. "The blood of 
Polly Klaas" is on the hands of the committee members, the talk show hosts 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, not every listener distinguished radio overkill from reality. 
Umberg, who debated the issue on air with the two hosts, received several death 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Such ugly utterances convince many liberal Democrats that the Klaas case has 
ignited the sort of mob mentality that will not produce intelligent, reasoned 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now it's like everyone is just piling on, trying to dream up the most 
Draconian proposal they can," said Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-Oakland), a liberal 
on the safety committee who has continued to oppose many of the anti-crime 
measures. "People need to understand that we've made our sentencing laws in 
California the toughest in the world and it simply has not worked. It hasn't 
made us safer." 
</P>
<P>
 Such beliefs have helped guide the Assembly Public Safety Committee for about 
a quarter-century. The panel has consistently stopped legislation the 
Democratic majority deemed reactionary or unconstitutional -- everything from 
measures to strengthen death penalty laws to bills that would relax controls on 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have long clung to a general philosophy that the way to stop crime is to 
address it as a social welfare issue, not to punish people who do wrong," the 
GOP's Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many former staffers, Democrats and Republicans alike, say the panel has 
often performed a worthy service by killing half-baked legislation whipped up 
by lawmakers out to appear tough on crime. Rejected out of hand, for example, 
was a proposal some years ago to castrate repeat rape offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, critics contend, the committee also has slammed the door on 
good ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reason did not always prevail," said Judge Gary Mullen, who was appointed to 
the Sacramento County Superior Court in 1990 after staff stints with the state 
Senate and the California District Attorneys Assn. "Historically, the committee 
has been absolutely stacked, in some years to such a degree that it's 
essentially been controlled by the ACLU and the criminal defense bar. Even 
moderate legislation was killed." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's actions have been oriented as much toward politics as policy, 
insiders say. By scuttling bills before they reached the Assembly floor, the 
panel has protected Democratic members -- particularly those in vulnerable 
districts -- from having to cast politically damaging votes that Republicans 
might use against them on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have consistently groused about the makeup of the committee, which 
has a smaller percentage of GOP representatives than any other in the Assembly. 
Under rules calling for proportional representation on all committees, the 
eight-member panel should have three Republicans, but in recent years has had 
only two. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, Republicans say, is simple: Assembly Speaker Willie Brown has 
historically packed the panel with liberals, often from safe districts, so 
tough crime legislation stays bottled up while moderate Democrats like Umberg 
and Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos), the committee chairman, can cast 
law-and-order votes that play well in their blue-collar districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg rejects such Machiavellian characterizations. "I've had my own 
frustrations in that committee. I've had bills watered down or killed," he 
said. "But I think those actions are born of true philosophical differences 
between members of the committee and not political machinations." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some critics concede the committee gauntlet has occasionally yielded 
legislation pleasing to the toughest crime fighter. Prison construction bills 
usually trundle through, and help for law enforcement agencies is routinely 
embraced. When a rash of freeway shootings hit Southern California a few years 
ago, the committee reacted within weeks to produce new legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullen was consistently irked by the panel's actions, but he retains fond 
memories of working with Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco), a former 
safety committee chairman who remains a liberal heavyweight on the panel, on a 
pair of bills in 1990 to reform the state penal code from top to bottom. The 
legislation was vetoed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He, of all the past chairmen, was a realist," Mullen said. "You could sit 
down and talk to the man. We didn't get a lot, but what we did get was 
extremely significant." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as liberals and conservatives in the Legislature continue to disagree on 
solutions, Burton suggests the gulf may be narrowing. "Times have changed," he 
said. "People realize you can't give criminals cookies and milk and a pat on 
the head and say, 'Now be good boys.' In the same vein, I don't think most 
Republicans really believe you've got to lock them up on the first offense and 
throw away the key. You've got to take a shot at rehabilitating these 
first-time offenders." 
</P>
<P>
 Bates hopes the Legislature will get beyond the current fervor and seize on 
innovative programs that provide focused help to "at-risk" families and 
struggling youngsters. The liberal lawmaker also wants to see alternatives to 
prison such as well-supervised work programs for drug dealers and other 
nonviolent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are vengeful and have blood in their eyes, politicians will reflect 
that," Bates said. "I have to hope the electorate will come off its emotional 
frenzy and realize that the direction we're now in hasn't worked."

HOME ON THE RANGE; RANCHO MISSION VIEJO OWNERS RESIST DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON 
THEIR 40,000-ACRE SPREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a densely populated county where living space is usually measured in small 
lots and tightly arranged apartments and condominiums, the vast Rancho Mission 
Viejo might seem a mythical place in a dime Western. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch sprawls over 40,000 acres of amber hills and grasslands that is pure 
cattle country. Since 1882, cowboys have ridden the brand of the Rancho Mission 
Viejo, repairing fences and rounding up cattle for market. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the inexorable tide of development wipes out much of Orange County's 
pioneer heritage, family members say the last roundup at the rancho will not be 
anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Patriarch Richard O'Neill Sr. bought the ranch more than a century ago. In 
recent decades, real estate interests have come to the O'Neills with proposals 
to build everything from an amusement park to a garbage dump on the ranch 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most influential families in southern Orange County, the O'Neills 
own the Santa Margarita Co., builder of Rancho Santa Margarita, a planned 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a number in the clan are major land developers in the county, when it 
comes to building on the family ranch, their answer has been a flat "No." 
</P>
<P>
 "All these people have designs on the land," said Gilbert Aguirre, who runs 
Rancho Mission Viejo. "Our world is getting smaller, but the family is 
dedicated to being in the cattle business for the next 110 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The family also has strong links to the historic mission town of San Juan 
Capistrano. Dick O'Neill, 70, a grandson of the ranch founder, is trying to buy 
and redevelop a block of downtown commercial property there. O'Neill, who owns 
the El Adobe restaurant in town, has been heavily involved with the Orange 
County Democratic Party over the years. The O'Neill family's wealth was 
estimated at $500 million by Forbes magazine in 1992. Both the ranch and the 
city share a rough-and-tumble legacy that lasted through the 1950s, when 
old-timers say it was not uncommon to see cowboys riding their horses through 
the saloons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were golden times," said Tony Moiso, the grandson of Richard O'Neill 
who oversees ranch operations. "San Juan Capistrano was so isolated in those 
days before (Interstate 5) was built in the early '60s. We feel very much tied 
to the town." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, 15,000 head of cattle were raised at the Rancho Mission Viejo. 
Today, about 6,000 head graze there, still making it the largest cattle 
operation in Southern California, said local historian Jim Sleeper. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, development has whittled down the amount of prime 
grassland available for cattle and even the Rancho Mission Viejo has been 
forced to buy acreage in northern Nevada, where the herd is sent to feed each 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Although beef prices have been good for the last few years, "historically, 
it's not been very profitable to raise cattle for most people," Aguirre said. 
"You can't control the prices set on your product." 
</P>
<P>
 To generate income to run the ranch -- which is about three times the size of 
San Francisco -- the family, headed by Moiso, began planning the community of 
Rancho Santa Margarita at the foot of the Saddleback Mountains in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered over development of the pristine canyon area, the plans drew heavy 
criticism from residents and environmentalists. But it was approved, and today 
20,000 residents live in the half-completed development. Meanwhile, company 
officials established a 1,600-acre nature conservancy on the ranch that is open 
to public tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could throw a fence around the place and keep everyone out, but that would 
be terribly irresponsible," Moiso said. "I feel blessed to be able to develop a 
portion of the land and remain a rancher on the rest." 
</P>
<P>
 However, local environmentalist Sherry Meddick is torn about the Santa 
Margarita Co.'s environmental record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt so funny that someone could donate incredible resources and 
also be responsible for the development coming behind it that impacts these 
preserves," said Meddick, a Silverado Canyon resident who works for Greenpeace 
in Los Angeles. "They donate the parkland but unfortunately, the flood plain 
from the (housing) developments flows into the park area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I frankly think Dick and Donna O'Neill have concerns for the land . . . but 
if the area's ecological integrity is disturbed, I don't see the point of 
donating" parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 The family patriarch, Richard O'Neill, was a former butcher who, after 
arriving in the United States from Ireland, operated a ranch in Merced County. 
When the 200,000-acre estate of John Forster was put up for sale, O'Neill saw 
an opportunity he could not pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 It was truly the big country. Stretching from Oceanside to Aliso Creek in what 
is now Lake Forest, O'Neill was looking at 359 square miles of prime grazing 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 He found a financier in silver magnate James Flood, who was willing to put up 
$457,000. In 1882, the men purchased the vast plot of land. O'Neill lived 
another 24 years, surviving to see the Santa Fe Railroad lay tracks through the 
ranch, greatly increasing its worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch passed through the hands of three generations of O'Neills. The 
immense property was divided in the late 1930s when the Flood heirs decided to 
leave the cattle business. 
</P>
<P>
 The O'Neills kept the Orange County portion of the ranch, a decision that soon 
proved prescient when the federal government in 1942 enacted the War Powers Act 
and, through its eminent domain powers, took over what became Camp Pendleton, a 
training base for the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 The family started the planned community of Mission Viejo in the mid-1960s, 
but sold the 10,000-acre development in 1972 to the Phillip Morris Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout their dealings, the family has been determined to remain in the 
cattle business. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual spring roundup, when calves are born and branded, remains a deeply 
ingrained ranch tradition. The El Viaje de Portola, where several hundred 
riders re-create the trail of Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portola in southern 
Orange County, is another way the family celebrates the area's heritage.

RAIN, COURT DELAY MALATHION SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The aerial application of the insecticide malathion over an 18-square-mile 
area of Corona and Norco -- which had been slated to begin Monday night -- has 
been postponed at least until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 State agricultural officials announced Monday morning that they had postponed 
plans to begin aerial spraying for a week because of inclement weather. In the 
afternoon, a Superior Court judge ruled that the aerial spraying warranted 
further review, guaranteeing that the helicopters would not fly until Feb. 2, 
when he will hear further arguments on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial spraying is necessary, state officials maintain, because the discovery 
of a mated Mediterranean fruit fly in Corona last month required quick and 
dramatic action before the fruit-ravaging pest spreads into agriculture-rich 
lands elsewhere in the state. The aerial application is part of a massive 
effort to eradicate the Medfly; in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Orange 
counties, billions of sterile insects will be released to combat the pest. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona city officials filed a lawsuit Friday, asking that the spraying be 
blocked, at least temporarily, until the public health consequences of using 
the insecticide could be debated. Critics of the use of malathion say studies 
show there is a potential for danger to human health. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before Monday's hearing before Riverside County Superior Court Judge 
Victor Miceli began, state Department of Food and Agriculture officials said 
the spraying would be delayed a week because of the threat of rain, which would 
nullify its effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Miceli said he wanted to study the issue more and give attorneys the 
chance to provide him with additional information and arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 He rescheduled the hearing for the morning of Feb. 2, when he could either 
order the helicopters grounded or allow that night's spraying to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the spraying said the delay marked a victory for them because the 
longer the spraying is delayed, the less serious the appearance of a single 
Medfly -- with no additional findings -- would seem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Medfly has already gone through two life cycles without additional 
sightings, so I don't know what the emergency is anymore," Corona City 
Councilman Jeff Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials said that with the judge's blessing, the sprayings would 
occur sooner or later, weather permitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't walk away from this," said Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the 
food and agriculture department. Because the life cycle of the Medfly is slowed 
during winter months, hundreds of Medfly pupae may be in the ground, on the 
verge of hatching, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A nine-day delay would not be fatal in the state's attack on the Corona 
infestation, Siddiqui said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the city of Corona contend that the aerial spraying jeopardizes 
public health. Furthermore, they argue, the state failed to abide by its own 
guidelines by wanting to spray without conducting an environmental impact 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Charles W. Getz said outside the courtroom that Corona's 
lawsuit was similar to more than 35 others filed in previous years against the 
state, attempting to keep the helicopters from flying over various communities. 
In 1989-90, the state sprayed more than 500 square miles of Los Angeles, Orange 
and San Diego counties in an attempt to rid the region of the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 The state prevailed in each of the previous court challenges, Getz said, and 
the sprayings went forward. 
</P>

 "Corona did a very good job (in preparing the court challenge) in the time it 
had, but the theories they've raised have been heard before," Getz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state did not need to file an environmental impact report, Getz said, 
because Gov. Pete Wilson last week issued an emergency declaration allowing the 
spraying to occur.

 It took the U-Haul Co.'s truck rental store in Northridge a few days to get 
back in business after last week's earthquake, but as soon as the doors were 
opened Thursday a line formed to the end of the parking lot. And the phone 
hasn't stopped ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business has increased at least tenfold," said manager Andrew Couplin. 
"I've had people yelling at us, crying, 'This is an emergency!' Well, it's an 
emergency for a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for major rental companies said they do not have statistics for the 
increase in business since the quake, but local managers said volume is 
extremely heavy. Officials at Ryder Trucks and U-Haul said they are bringing in 
several hundred additional trucks to meet the increased demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Most customers planned to move locally, from quake-ravaged areas such as 
Northridge to other parts of the Los Angeles Basin, the moving company 
officials said. But a few left the San Fernando Valley for Ventura County, 
elsewhere in California or other states. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been very busy and hectic," said Scott Brontsema, manager for the 
U-Haul in Canyon Country in the Santa Clarita Valley. "I have a waiting list 
for trucks with 70 names on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people, Brontsema said, have failed to return trucks, causing him to 
speculate that they might be living in them. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers from Santa Monica-based Western Moving and Storage have been moving 
two or three families daily since the earthquake, said John Black, the company 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been running on maximum capacity," Black said. "We had every truck 
that we had out in the area, doing local moving or helping offices move out. It 
is such a huge increase, I can't even put it at a percentage." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's Chatsworth office was slightly damaged but was open, with trucks 
sent from a facility in Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to move as many people out before the rains catch us," Black 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lym Tecson said she rented a Ryder truck in Northridge to move from her Reseda 
apartment to a small house in Oxnard. "I was really scared (by the 
earthquake)," she said. "I thought I was going to get crushed. I just want out 
of here." 
</P>
<P>
 At the U-Haul truck rental in Northridge, one of the areas hit hardest by 
Monday's quake, residents waited in line Sunday for the chance to move their 
valuables out of the San Fernando Valley and into homes or garages of friends 
and relatives. In order to get trucks to as many people as possible, managers 
at the store limited the length of time customers could rent a truck to six 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we got the last one," said Lyle Kurtz, 31, a doctor from Sherman Oaks 
who was moving to his brother-in-law's house. 
</P>
<P>
 U-Haul officials spent much of the weekend coordinating the arrival of trucks 
from throughout Southern California at areas hit by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 For the trip to Los Angeles, the company offered to lend them to relief 
agencies such as the Red Cross. The agencies filled them in places such as San 
Diego and Riverside with goods for quake victims and brought them to the Valley 
and other stricken areas. Once here, the trucks were emptied and rented to 
people who needed to move their belongings.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DOCTORS TRY TO HEAL PRACTICES THAT SUFFERED 
SEVERE SHOCK; HEALTH: PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS CONTEND WITH UNUSABLE OFFICES, 
WRECKED EQUIPMENT, JUMBLED FILES -- AND ANXIOUS PATIENTS.

 By the time Dr. Farid Farid reached his Sherman Oaks medical officeafter last 
week's earthquake, the floor was knee-deep in water. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of patient records were scattered everywhere. All the windows were 
broken. There was no telephone service, electricity or heat. And when Farid 
refused to pay a plumber $300 to fix the water heater, the man cut the pipe he 
had just fixed and left. 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, Farid, a family physician who runs another office near Koreatown, 
was still struggling to get his practice back to normal, trying to reassemble 
his clinics while soothing patients anxious about their next examinations or 
prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're kind of shaky, of course. Nervous wrecks. That's understandable. But 
unless it's a real emergency, high fever or pain, they've had their 
appointments postponed," Farid said. 
</P>
<P>
 His experience is hardly unique. Across Los Angeles, hundreds of doctors, 
dentists and other medical practitioners have seen their offices damaged or 
closed by the quake. Combined with the damage it wreaked on local hospitals, 
the temblor has seriously disrupted the city's medical network. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients have missed kidney dialysis treatments, psychotherapy sessions and 
dental appointments. They have developed infections from untreated cuts and 
been unable to get prescriptions refilled. At some medical offices in the San 
Fernando Valley, the phone goes unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with customers without prescriptions, some pharmacists have given 
away small amounts of non-narcotic drugs. X-rays have been ruined and patient 
files upended, turning records rooms into vast heaps of jumbled paper and 
leaving physicians without vital data about patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything twisted and turned and they all came down," said Doris Skouros of 
the 90-doctor Facey Medical Group in Mission Hills, as she ruefully watched 
more than a dozen workers painstakingly replace thousands of fallen file 
folders on shelves Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hillman, executive director of the Unified Medical Group Assn., a Seal 
Beach-based organization that represents large doctors' groups, said Facey and 
two other San Fernando Valley-based medical groups were the hardest hit by the 
quake. Combined, the three groups serve more than 170,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem they have now is finding exam rooms and adequate space to see 
patients," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Facey, doctors worked two to an office because the front portion of the 
building was badly damaged by the quake. They worked in shifts, one physician 
seeing patients from 8 a.m. until 2 p.m., and another taking over from then 
until 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At a front desk, sick people crowded a waiting room while nurses frantically 
tried to reschedule appointments. There was no heat, and a large rooftop air 
conditioner sat in what had once been a garden atrium. The machinery had 
toppled from two stories above. 
</P>
<P>
 Facey was forced to close down its Porter Ranch office indefinitely because of 
heavy damage, and other offices in Canyon Country and Valencia were also 
damaged. Because the group's regular medical courier service was not operating, 
Facey employees had to carry needed medications to Santa Clarita Valley 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Dellavedova, executive administrator of Greater Valley Medical Group, 
which has 30 doctors, nine offices and 50,000 patients in the San Fernando and 
Santa Clarita valleys, said the group's buildings and equipment may have 
suffered $1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Its offices in Granada Hills and Mission Hills could be condemned, but its 
other offices were being reopened Monday. The group has no earthquake 
insurance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Displaced group doctors have been offered temporary office space by both Holy 
Cross Hospital and Granada Hills Community Hospital, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Calverley, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Medical Assn., said that 
so many doctors were knocked out of their offices that the association is 
sending faxes to its 1,000 members listing space to lease elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Walter Murrell, a psychologist, got hit with a double blow. His offices in 
Sherman Oaks and in West Los Angeles were both ruined by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 At his West Los Angeles office, in the condemned Barrington Building, all his 
patient records were destroyed. But he hopes to be able to salvage some records 
in his Valley office. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Murrell is already seeing patients again at newly leased offices 
in Santa Monica and the Valley. And he is turning the move into a test of sorts 
for his patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offices were a stable influence in my patients' lives, a place where they 
could go and let their hair down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they are gone. But it's been a good barometer for me of how well they are 
doing. It shows who can adapt to change and who cannot." 
</P>
<P>
 Many pharmacies were shut down for several days last week, while telephones at 
others were still tied up continually Monday, as pharmacists continued to 
reshelve medications. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy P. King, a pharmacist at Patton Pharmacy in Santa Monica, said his 
building was so badly damaged that he moved to another a mile away, where he 
shares space with St. John's Medical Plaza Pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our roommates are going to get real sick of us. It's stressful but I 
try to remind myself this is an adventure," he said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DAMAGE REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some facts and figures on the aftermath of last week's magnitude 6.6 
earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 * DEATHS: State estimate increased from 55 to 57 
</P>
<P>
 * INJURIES: More than 7,315 people have been treated and released at 
hospitals; about 1,241 were admitted for care. 
</P>
<P>
 * AFTERSHOCKS: There were at least five aftershocks of 3.0 or greater 
magnitude on Monday. Since the initial magnitude 6.6 quake, scientists have 
recorded more than 2,500 aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * DAMAGE: More than 10,000 buildings had been inspected. Officials have 
declared 4,322 buildings, including 14,576 dwelling units, at least partially 
unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARRESTS: The Los Angeles Police Department has taken 342 people into custody 
in a 5 1/2-day period. Most were general arrests and not for curfew violations 
or looting. On a typical day, there are about 550 arrests in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOMELESS: Hundreds remained housed in Army tents at six San Fernando Valley 
parks as the storm approached. 
</P>
<P>
 * NATIONAL GUARD: Officials said some of the 6,300 National Guard troops 
mobilized to help in disaster-relief efforts will begin moving out of the city, 
but some of them will be replaced by guardsmen from other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * UTILITIES: Electricity has been restored to all but a handful of customers. 
Boil-water directives remained in effect for the Santa Monica Mountains, 
Pacific Palisades and the West San Fernando Valley. At least 80,000 customers 
have had gas service restored since the quake, but several thousand more 
remained without gas. 
</P>
<P>
 * TRANSIT: Metrolink trains began stopping Monday in Lancaster and Palmdale. 
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority set up a line called the Westside 
Special to help commuters cope with the shutdown of the Santa Monica Freeway 
(I-10). Buses on Line 634 leave every 20 minutes during weekday morning and 
evening rush hours, or as demand warrants. The one-way fare is $1.50. A 
commuter hot line, (800) 286-RIDE, has been set up to provide information on 
car pools, road closures and other information. 
</P>
<P>
 * SCHOOLS: Counselors will be available to speak with parents and/or students 
at the following hot lines: in the San Fernando Valley: (818) 997-2640, (818) 
997-2398 or (818) 997-2545; in Central and South-Central Los Angeles, (213) 
754-2856 or (213) 753-4551; in South and Harbor areas (310) 832-7545; West 
(310) 444-9913; East (213) 625-6190; middle school and senior high school 
students: (213) 742-7551 or (213) 625-6335.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; 1990 FUNDS TO BOLSTER BUILDINGS IN LIMBO; BOND 
ISSUE: THE STATE IS STILL TRYING TO DETERMINE WHICH GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES ARE 
MOST IN NEED OF STRENGTHENING. OF $300 MILLION OKD IN MEASURE, ONLY ABOUT $60 
MILLION HAS BEEN APPROPRIATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even as lawmakers propose new taxes and bond issues to repair Los Angeles' 
earthquake damage, about $240 million that voters approved nearly four years 
ago to strengthen government buildings remains in bureaucratic limbo while the 
state struggles to determine which of thousands of structures are most in need 
of repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally expected to take two years, the process of doling out the money 
from Proposition 122, approved by voters in 1990, has taken far longer and is 
not complete. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start, a survey of 14,000 state buildings was hampered by a lack of 
response from building managers and the hassle of thinning the voluminous list, 
which included structures such as restrooms at state parks and warehouses used 
to store sand and salt dumped on Sierra highways during snowstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeated turnover among the people in charge of the program has further slowed 
progress. An elaborate computer program written to rank the state's buildings 
had to be redone when it produced illogical results. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $300-million bond measure, about $60 million has been appropriated, 
though only about $5 million has been spent, according to the state Department 
of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of the $60 million has been set aside for pet projects of state 
lawmakers: a Sacramento office building for legislative employees, preliminary 
plans for new state buildings in Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's San Francisco 
district, and repairs on a Los Angeles museum that is favored by several 
prominent Democratic lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials defend the time lag, saying they want to make sure they do the 
job right, if not quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've taken as much time as we need on this," said General Services 
Department spokesman Greg Sandin. "It's a very involved process." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials now say they expect to make a partial list of recommendations 
public by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say the job has taken too long. 
</P>
<P>
 In a strongly worded letter to Gov. Pete Wilson, Sen. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles) on Thursday urged the governor to make the expenditure of bond funds 
"one of your highest priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no excuse for the failure to make the timely expenditure of these 
approved funds," Torres said. "We simply cannot wait much longer for a detailed 
expenditure plan for bond funds." Torres threatened legislative action unless 
the Administration acts swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres persuaded the Legislature to put the measure on the ballot in the wake 
of the devastating 1989 Loma Prieta quake. It was designed, in part, to raise 
money to repair several severely damaged state buildings in Oakland and San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure authorized the state architect to probe the seismic safety 
of all state buildings, excluding campuses of California State University and 
the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 There was considerable damage on the Cal State Northridge campus, but no other 
state buildings were seriously damaged by the Northridge quake. Because the 
state is still putting together its list of buildings in need of retrofitting, 
the status of state buildings in the quake area is not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the process of finalizing the list was expected to be finished by 
the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 L. Thomas Tobin, executive director of the state Seismic Safety Commission, 
said that panel's members saw Proposition 122 as the first installment of a 
10-year program to keep state and local government buildings standing during 
severe earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought that the money would be spent rather quickly," Tobin said, "and we 
knew, from the vulnerability of government buildings, that we were priming the 
pump. It was our full expectation and intention that we would be writing the 
'Son of Prop. 122' for the 1992 ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is made up of 17 members, 15 appointed by the governor and two 
by the Legislature, and was established to advise Wilson and lawmakers on 
seismic safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobin was reluctant to blame anyone for what has happened since. But he said: 
"The slowness and delays have been a real frustration for us." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for state architect Harry C. Hallenbeck said the agency met 
numerous unforeseen snags that have slowed its progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it could have been done in less time," said Joel McRonald, chief of 
special programs in the architect's office. "There were some miscues when it 
got started. There was a change in administrations." 
</P>
<P>
 McRonald, the third official in the past three years to oversee the program, 
acknowledged that his office has received reports for only half the state's 
14,000 buildings. However, he insisted, "we believe we have gotten all the big 
buildings into our process." 
</P>
<P>
 The original two-year time estimate was inaccurate, McRonald said. "Somebody 
just totally misread what was required." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientific errors also contributed to the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Cluff, a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. geologist and member of the Seismic 
Safety Commission, said the mathematical model devised by the architect's 
office to rank the buildings did not work. Buildings that clearly should have 
been ranked high were not, and structures that experts agreed were sound were 
near the top of the list, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, a new ranking system was devised and the process started anew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we're all to blame," Cluff said. "You just can't point your finger at 
the other guy . . . it's within the earthquake community. We're not focused 
enough to keep this moving. . . . I'm a businessman and I just get fed up with 
all this paperwork these guys have to go through." 
</P>
<P>
 While the state architect has had difficulty ranking the state buildings, 
lawmakers have not. They have earmarked some of the money for projects favored 
by some of the Legislature's most powerful members. Although each allocation 
has been justified as needed for earthquake safety, the projects have been 
funded without having to compete with other state buildings, as the 
voter-approved measure envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest chunk of money, about $41 million, has been set aside to restore 
70,000-square-feet of exhibit space at the California Museum of Science and 
Industry in Los Angeles that was closed in 1990 by seismic safety officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Glad, a deputy director at the Exposition Park complex, said the 
museum was able to win the appropriation with the help of Sen. Teresa Hughes 
(D-Los Angeles) even though the process of prioritizing the state's needs had 
not been finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody pretty much agreed we would have been in the top 10" buildings in 
need of seismic improvements, she said, noting that two aging structures at the 
museum were condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-largest appropriation, $10 million, was designated to help convert 
a state office building across from the Capitol for use by the Legislature. 
Legislative staffers are using the building, but the money for retrofitting has 
never been spent. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Seismic Safety Commission criticized both proposals, contending that 
the allocation of quake safety funds was premature until the list was 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission said the best approach would be to spend small amounts at many 
buildings in order to improve safety in as many locations as possible. The 
legislative office building, the commission said, would cost too much for the 
benefit that would be derived. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Sacramento building conversion was debated in 1991, Sen. William Craven 
(R-Oceanside), who carried the proposal in the Senate, maintained that "there 
is not one scintilla of politics involved in it" and that the money would only 
be spent on seismic work. 
</P>
<P>
 A third appropriation of about $4 million was set aside for plans to replace a 
state building damaged in the San Francisco district of Speaker Brown in the 
1989 temblor. Another portion of the funds is for a building in Oakland, named 
after Elihu Harris, a former assemblyman now serving as mayor. About $3 million 
has been set aside for the Seismic Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Department of General Services on Friday estimated that of the 
$300-million bond, only $5 million has been spent since passage of Proposition 
122, officially known as the Earthquake Safety and Public Buildings 
Rehabilitation Bond Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason only $5 million of the $60 million appropriated has been spent is 
because of the slow process of planning for retrofitting, which can include 
environmental reports and agreement on the retrofitting scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 The $300-million fund was split into two portions. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest share, $250 million, was designated for state buildings, with the 
remaining $50 million aimed at buttressing local government buildings that 
provide essential police and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 McRonald of the architect's office said that the list of eligible local 
government structures has been whittled down to fewer than 200 buildings but 
has not been finalized.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; STATE SAYS NO RETROFIT COULD HAVE SAVED ROAD; 
DAMAGE: OFFICIALS RECANT CLAIM THAT I-5 AND ANTELOPE VALLEY FREEWAY INTERCHANGE 
MIGHT HAVE SURVIVED QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Reversing initial assessments, California transportation officials 
acknowledged Monday that even if the interchange of Interstate 5 and the 
Antelope Valley Freeway (California 14) had been fully retrofitted, it probably 
would not have withstood the shaking it took from the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 James Roberts, Caltrans' chief bridge engineer, said it is doubtful that any 
retrofitting plan could have strengthened the structures at the interchange 
sufficiently to hold up under the kind of horizontal movement that occurred 
during the early morning temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you could retrofit it," said Roberts. "You'd have to at least 
take a chunk of the span out and rebuild it entirely." 
</P>
<P>
 He said new data gathered at the site of the interchange collapse indicates 
that during the quake, the extent of lateral swaying may have been as much as 
10 feet, a figure that is three or four times higher than the greatest movement 
recorded at similar structures in previous California quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the retrofit plan being formulated for the interchange before the 
earthquake anticipated movement of only two or three feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts' comments came as the Assembly Transportation Committee began a 
hearing to scrutinize the department's seismic retrofitting program and its 
plans for rebuilding bridges that collapsed in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans Director James Van Loben Sels told lawmakers that with 
round-the-clock construction work, the department expects to have some of the 
bridges rebuilt much earlier than initially expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the quake, the department estimated that the replacement bridges 
would be ready in about a year, but now Van Loben Sels said some can be 
completed in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Targeted for that six-month timetable, he said, will be bridges to replace 
collapsed structures at the Golden State Freeway and Gavin Canyon interchange. 
He said new bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway will probably be ready in nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take as long as a year, he said, to repair the Golden State Freeway 
and Antelope Valley Freeway interchange because of problems with unstable 
soils. Likewise, structures on the Simi Valley Freeway will take about a year 
but in the meantime will be replaced by temporary bridges, Van Loben Sels said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will require our contractors to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to 
get this finished," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the optimistic rebuilding forecasts, lawmakers at the hearing grilled 
Caltrans officials on the causes of the freeway failures. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts conceded that engineers were unprepared for the strength of the quake. 
And he acknowledged that retrofitting alone probably could not have worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Had engineers known that the higher forces could strike the bridges, he said 
they probably would have opted to tear down and rebuild, rather than retrofit, 
some of the structures. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Roberts said he still believes that the state's retrofitting 
technology is sound and has proven that it can protect large highway structures 
from collapse in a major temblor. The exception, he said, is the combination of 
a strong quake occurring directly beneath a roadway structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the bridges that collapsed in the Jan. 17 temblor, in fact, he said, 
are in this category. They include structures on the Antelope Valley Freeway, 
at the I-5 and Gavin Canyon interchange and the I-5 and California 14 
interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "You literally had a fault zinging right through the middle of it that we 
didn't know about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as engineers know, he said, those are the only bridges in the state 
that face that kind of danger. 
</P>
<P>
 With new construction and design techniques, he said bridges can be built 
today to withstand those kind of forces.

FAA AND ASPEN IN DOGFIGHT OVER AIRPORT CURFEW; THE COUNTY CITES SAFETY FOR 
BANNING PRIVATE PLANES AFTER SUNSET. RESIDENTS WANT QUIET EVENINGS. BUT THE 
GOVERNMENT WANTS EQUAL ACCESS.

 The roar of jet engines plowing through a snowstorm near the 12,000-foot 
granite peaks surrounding this ski resort's busy airport gives Pitkin County 
Sheriff Bob Braudis the willies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in charge of mass casualty response," Braudis said, "and there's no doubt 
that a big jet calling a distress signal late at night in a driving snowstorm 
would eclipse our ability to respond." 
</P>
<P>
 But that is not the only reason Braudis says he will fight to keep a 
controversial sunset curfew at Aspen Airport, the only airport in the nation 
with a two-tiered curfew that bars charter and private aircraft after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 For four years, the Federal Aviation Administration has tried to halt the 
curfew, contending that private pilots should be allowed to fly in and out 
until 11 p.m., just like commercial planes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The safety issue is partially a straw dog," Braudis said. "The real issue is 
environmental -- the easier it is to get in here, the more people will come." 
</P>
<P>
 In what locals see as a showdown over Aspen's ability to control its 
environment -- in the air and on the ground -- the Pitkin County Board of 
Commissioners this month made a final offer to resolve the bitter dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the county's compromise, private pilots would be allowed airport access 
until 11 p.m. if they have the same training, safety equipment and power 
capabilities required of commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 After repeated warnings to end the curfew, the FAA last year halted Aspen's $1 
million in annual federal funds for improvements at the airport -- the third 
busiest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the FAA will go along with barring lesser equipped private pilots -- 
which could set a precedent for airports elsewhere -- is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a community known as a getaway for the rich and famous, they'd just as 
soon foot the bill to keep extra air traffic out. Warned Pitkin County 
Commission Chairman Bill Tuite: "If our compromise is not accepted by the FAA, 
we'll move to take the airport private and pay for improvements and maintenance 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Aspen enacted its two-tiered curfew in 1978 after a series of plane crashes 
and numerous injuries and deaths -- most of them attributed to pilot error. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA tacitly allowed the system to exist for more than a decade but changed 
its tune after private and business aircraft owners' groups started lobbying 
heavily in 1989. Their argument: The earlier curfew denied equal access to 
private and charter planes. The FAA agreed, contending that airports receiving 
federal dollars could not discriminate between commercial and private carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitkin County's proposed compromise is similar to one recommended this week by 
the General Accounting Office after a lengthy study of safety at high-altitude 
airports. While noting that the FAA has the authority to spike the sunset 
curfew, the GAO study advised the county that if private planes meet the same 
rigorous requirements for instrument flight as commercial airlines, then they 
should be permitted access until 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the GAO concluded that significant safety issues are associated 
with the airport. Fourteen general aviation accidents occurred between October, 
1982, and September, 1992, within 15 miles of Aspen Airport, the study found. 
That rate of 4.1 accidents per 100,000 operations at Aspen Airport was 78% 
higher than at four similar mountain airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond safety issues, county officials admit that their well-to-do residents 
don't want more noisy aircraft interfering with dinner chats in 
multimillion-dollar chalets. 
</P>
<P>
 Among longtime residents who cherish the peace and quiet is environmentalist 
and rock star Don Henley, who owns a farmhouse near the flight path. So far, he 
has spent more than $250,000 to bankroll the county's legal war with the FAA, 
county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Henley is a man who lives by his lyrics. Remember the line in his song, 'Call 
someplace paradise, kiss it goodby'?" said Pitkin County Commissioner Wayne 
Ethridge. "He just wants to preserve the community he loves." 
</P>
<P>
 But many business owners object to the county's stand, saying their 
livelihoods depend on the planeloads of skiers who fuel the resort's financial 
furnace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is hurting itself by encouraging people to go to other airports 
(and ski resorts) in the region who want the business," said Dan McCarty, a 
pilot of 23 years and spokesman for Tailwinds Aviation in Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspen Chamber of Commerce President Tom Hines agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pitkin County Commissioner Mick Ireland figures the residents of a resort 
town where home values average $1.2 million can easily absorb a property tax to 
raise the $1 million a year it would cost to operate the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA officials contend there is room for compromise but declined to comment on 
the county proposal pending a detailed study.

WHEN IS A SECRET NO LONGER A SECRET? DEBATE RAGES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The federal government is preparing to issue new rules that would declassify 
millions of secret documents and overhaul the entire defense industrial 
security system, setting off a fierce debate over whether the regulations go 
too far or not far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a proposed executive order prepared for President Clinton, federal 
agencies will be required in most cases to declassify top secret documents 
automatically after 15 years and secret documents after 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The 53-page draft order would require federal officials for the first time to 
weigh the public's right to know against the need for secrecy. The new rules 
also would clamp down on a rapidly growing area of secrecy known as special 
access programs, which operate with their own more stringent rules for physical 
security and personnel clearances. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Cold War, three separate federal panels are working to 
streamline the huge federal security system. A dozen federal agencies have 
authority to create secret documents, operate secure facilities and administer 
clearances for workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of this security apparatus for the defense industry alone is 
estimated at $13.8 billion annually. Major contractors have argued for years 
that these costs, borne by taxpayers, could be substantially pared if agencies 
would adopt uniform security standards and eliminate the current tangled web of 
rules. The first federal panel issuing recommendations is the Information 
Security Oversight Office, which was asked by Clinton to develop new rules 
governing the creation of classified documents and the declassification of 
existing secret papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very controversial issue," said Steven Garfinkel, director of the 
office. "You are going to hear criticism from those who want greater openness 
and those who say that greater openness will damage national security." 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of Garfinkel's draft order was leaked by the Federation of American 
Scientists, a major proponent of liberalization. After the leak, a senior 
Clinton Administration official said that the order will be revised and made 
bolder. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Aftergood, a research analyst at the scientists' group, criticized the 
draft order, saying the declassification takes too long under the new rules and 
liberal exceptions allow documents to remain secret indefinitely. The group has 
called for declassification of every secret document after 20 years, with very 
limited exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "While it is an improvement over the status quo, it does not go far enough," 
Aftergood said. "Somebody needs to decide whether the Cold War is over or not. 
Judging by this draft order, the Cold War is not yet over." 
</P>
<P>
 Garfinkel disagrees with that assessment, adding that the draft rules would 
reduce the creation of new secrets by 10% initially and by up to 50% in the 
long run. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate federal panel, known as the Joint Security Commission, has a much 
wider scope of authority to overhaul the entire security apparatus, covering 
personnel clearances and government facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Smith, commission chairman and a private attorney in Washington, said 
the group would issue "sweeping recommendations" on Feb. 1, but he declined to 
identify any of the proposed changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is studying changes to personnel clearance rules that minority 
groups say are discriminatory and congressional demands for appeals procedures 
for special access programs. 
</P>
<P>
 A third group, the National Industrial Security Program, is developing a new 
security manual for the defense industry. It was scheduled to release the 
manual this month, but has postponed the new regulations until June, according 
to Harry Volz, the group's chairman and head of security at Grumman Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Volz, Garfinkel and Smith said they are encountering significant resistance to 
liberalization from the defense and intelligence communities, although those 
opponents have never made a public statement against liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are folks just opposed to change," Volz said. "Some are opposed because 
they see a change to the status quo as a threat to their rice bowl. There are 
others who feel that change could jeopardize the security of information they 
are trying to protect."

MEXICO ACCUSED OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES DURING REVOLT; REPORT: AMNESTY 
INTERNATIONAL SAYS SOLDIERS TERRORIZED INDIAN VILLAGERS. ARMY HAS DENIED 
VIOLATING THE LAW, BUT GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO HELP WITH PROBE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A leading human rights group charged Monday that Mexican soldiers terrorized 
Indian villages -- beating, torturing and kidnaping inhabitants -- in the 
aftermath of the New Year's uprising in the southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Amnesty International investigators, in a report expected late Monday, accused 
the army of gross human rights violations and cited disappearances and summary 
executions among the abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to probe suspected executions have been stifled by the government's 
failure to allow foreign forensics experts to examine bodies or autopsy files, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has also refused to exhume corpses from 48 unmarked graves in a 
cemetery in the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez, said investigators from other 
human rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The army has issued blanket statements denying any violations of the law but 
refused repeated requests for information about specific charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges came as U.S. and Canadian politicians and citizens groups are 
questioning their countries' closer economic ties to a government that may have 
permitted brutalization of civilians in its efforts to put down the rebellion 
by an estimated 2,000 Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Amnesty investigators said about 70 Indians are being held without charge in 
the Chiapas state prison. Most claim to be victims of army roundups of 
villagers suspected to have ties to the Zapatista National Liberation Army, the 
rebels who on New Year's Day took over four county seats in Chiapas, an 
impoverished state on the Guatemalan border. 
</P>
<P>
 As the guerrillas pulled out of the towns into the jungle a few days later, an 
estimated 15,000 troops moved in. The army closed off the roads into formerly 
rebel-held areas and, according to eyewitness accounts cited by Amnesty, began 
a brutal search for insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.) has scheduled a hearing for Feb. 2 on 
allegations of army abuses. Clinton Administration officials have also 
expressed concerns that Mexico is not demonstrating the sensitivity to human 
rights that they would expect from a partner in the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, which took effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The government struck a conciliatory tone toward the rebels after a chorus of 
national and international protests greeted the army's attempts to defeat them 
during the first week of the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 That change in strategy came after Jan. 7, the morning soldiers entered the 
village of Morelia, near the previously occupied town of Altamirano, residents 
told Amnesty investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 That day, the men of Morelia were assembled and told to lie face down on the 
basketball court that also serves as the town square, townspeople said. Three 
men were taken into the church; their screams could be heard for the next three 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Amnesty report, the men were then taken away in an army 
ambulance, one of them bleeding profusely, and have not been seen since. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group was taken to the state prison, where Amnesty investigators 
interviewed them Friday. The rest lay on the court until the soldiers left at 
about 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a general brutalization of people," said Amnesty investigator 
Carlos Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 The human rights group based its findings on photos of bodies, interviews with 
villagers and a visit to the state prison, he said. Following a week of futile 
attempts, human rights workers were allowed into the prison Friday after 
Torricelli complained directly to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is 
not related to the human rights investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with prisoners also provided important evidence, said human rights 
activist Salinas, that seven bodies found in the market of another town, 
Ocosingo, site of the rebellion's fiercest fighting, were victims of 
executions. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies were found lined up with their hands behind their backs and bullet 
wounds in their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Prisoners reported having been bound with yellow cord similar to that found 
next to the Ocosingo bodies, and cuts on their wrists were similar to those in 
photographs of the corpses, Salinas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amnesty had to base its report on photos taken by the first news photographers 
to arrive in Ocosingo after the fighting, because the government's National 
Human Rights Commission refused to let the organization see autopsy reports.

 The Paris public prosecutor's office has concluded that Iran's secret service 
organized the 1991 murder of exiled former Iranian Prime Minister Shapour 
Bakhtiar, justice sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor's report recommended that three Iranian suspects held in France 
be brought before a court and that six other suspects on the run be tried in 
absentia, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is the final step in a nearly 30-month investigation of the killing 
of Bakhtiar, a leading figure in Iran's exiled opposition movement, near Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iranian Embassy in Paris denied any involvement by Iran or its secret 
service in the killings.

ARAB-ISRAELI TALKS RESUME IN WASHINGTON; DIPLOMACY: SITES OF MEETINGS ARE KEPT 
SECRET. SESSIONS ARE TERMED 'LESS STRUCTURED' THAN EARLIER. 
</P>

<P>
 Israeli and Arab negotiators resumed their Middle East peace talks Monday in 
an expectant mood after a four-month lull. But, persuaded that public exposure 
hinders progress, they kept their meeting places here secret. 
</P>
<P>
 The lull has proven productive: When it began, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat shook hands 
at the White House over an agreement for Palestinian autonomy. Near the end of 
the four months, Syrian President Hafez Assad, after meeting with President 
Clinton in Geneva, pronounced himself ready to negotiate a peace agreement with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the break has also made it clear that the key players and plays in the 
Middle East peace process operate outside the structure of the formal peace 
conference that opened in Madrid in October, 1991, and then moved to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, although Israeli negotiator Danl Rothschild reportedly met with 
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat in Washington on Monday, far more 
significant negotiations were conducted by the two sides in the Egyptian resort 
of Taba and were scheduled for the Swiss town of Davos this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said Israeli negotiators were 
meeting separately with Palestinian, Syrian, Lebanese and Jordanian 
negotiators. She described the sessions as "less structured, more streamlined" 
than those in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the exact sites of the Washington sessions were withheld from the 
media because "we felt that they would be most productive if the emphasis was 
on making progress and not just on making publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 "All of those who are participating . . ," she said, "simply felt that they 
did not want to be absolutely hammered every time they came and went with a 
whole bunch of questions." 
</P>
<P>
 In Egypt, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met for three hours to discuss 
control of telecommunications in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, then adjourned for 
a week. The more contentious issue of security -- who will guard the borders of 
the enclaves -- was left for Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian self-rule in Jericho and the Gaza Strip has been delayed because 
of the failure of both sides to agree on how Israel can monitor borders of the 
Palestinian enclaves without trampling on the Palestinians' sovereign feelings. 
The Palestinians do not want Israeli guards at the borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and Peres met over the weekend in Oslo, the site of their original 
agreement, but failed to iron out a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, Peres sounded optimistic, telling Israeli radio, "We are at the 
heart of negotiations, and I think we are fairly close to an agreement." Rabin 
told reporters: "There are signs of coming together. There is progress, but it 
will take time." 
</P>
<P>
 PLO sources said Arafat was less optimistic. He and Peres will meet at the 
Davos World Economic Forum and presumably will take up the security issue 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amir Moussa, who conferred with Arafat and 
other PLO officials Sunday, arrived in Jerusalem on Monday for talks. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials obviously hope the discussions between Israeli negotiator 
Itamar Rabinovitch and Syrian negotiator Mowaffak Allaf will test the sincerity 
of Assad's pledge that he is prepared to establish "normal peaceful relations" 
with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first session in Washington, Rabinovitch told Israeli television, 
"We opened a new round in a new place and a new atmosphere, with a good chance 
for progress, but we have to be realistic that it will be a long haul." 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis have been skeptical about the Assad overture. But Rabin has talked of 
the possibility of a military withdrawal from the Golan Heights.

POPE CALLS ON TV TO IMPROVE ITS IMAGE; MEDIA: THE PONTIFF SAYS TELEVISION IS 'A 
PUBLIC TRUST.' HE URGES GOVERNMENTS, VIEWERS AND THE INDUSTRY ITSELF TO POLICE 
IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Pope John Paul II took a hard look at television Monday and saw a bad picture. 
</P>
<P>
 He called on viewers, governments, parents and the industry itself to police 
and improve a medium he described as "a public trust" that must "serve the 
well-being of society as a whole. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "In fulfilling its public responsibilities, the television industry should 
develop and observe a code of ethics which includes a commitment to serving the 
needs of families and to promoting values supportive of family life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Media councils, with members from both the industry and the general public, 
are also a highly desirable way of making television more responsive to the 
needs and values of its audience," John Paul said in a written message released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roman Catholic Church supports freedom of speech and of the press, John 
Paul noted, but believes that individuals, families and society itself have a 
right to privacy, public decency and the protection of basic moral values. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public authorities are invited to set and enforce reasonable ethical 
standards for programming which will foster the human and religious values on 
which family life is built, and will discourage whatever is harmful," John Paul 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The papal remarks were issued in the context of his visit to the Vatican Press 
Room on the feast of St. Francis de Sales, a 17th-Century French bishop and 
Reformation preacher whom the Catholic Church calls the patron saint of 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking fit and relaxed, the 73-year-old pontiff reiterated longstanding 
desires to visit the Holy Land and China. John Paul also stressed the 
importance he attaches to his planned midyear trip to Lebanon, and he again 
decried barbarism in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 His most pointed thoughts on the media, though, came in the text of remarks -- 
"Television and the Family: Guidelines for Good Viewing" -- prepared for a 
church World Social Communications Day in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope, whose own TV viewing is restricted to the evening news and an 
occasional soccer game, called television the "spearhead of a communications 
revolution" that can help draw families and communities together. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another side, the Pope warned: "Television can also harm family 
life -- by propagating degrading values and models of behavior; by broadcasting 
pornography and graphic depictions of brutal violence; by inculcating moral 
relativism and religious skepticism; by spreading distorted, manipulative 
accounts of news events and current issues; by carrying exploitative 
advertising that appeals to base instincts, and by glorifying false visions of 
life that obstruct the realization of mutual respect, of justice and of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, he said, TV can "isolate family members in their private worlds, 
cutting them off from authentic interpersonal relations; it can also divide the 
family by alienating parents from children, and children from parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being discriminating in what they watch themselves, it is up to 
parents to shape their children's viewing habits, John Paul said. 
</P>

 "Forming children's viewing habits will sometimes mean simply turning off the 
television set. . . . Parents who make regular, prolonged use of television as 
a kind of electronic baby-sitter surrender their role as the primary educators 
of their children," John Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-regulation by the TV industry is a key step toward a healthier product, 
in the papal view. 
</P>
<P>
 "Television personnel all have serious moral responsibilities to the families 
that make up such a large part of their audience. . . . Recognizing the 
influence of the medium in which they work, they should promote sound moral and 
spiritual values," John Paul said.

RUSSIA CABINET FENDS OFF PREDICTIONS IT'LL ABANDON TIGHT MONEY, REFORMS; 
ECONOMY: ASSERTIONS COME IN THE FACE OF INTERNATIONAL ALARM THAT PERSONNEL 
CHANGES PRESAGE SHIFT AWAY FROM RADICAL MOVES OF LAST TWO YEARS.

<P>
 Russia's new Cabinet, fending off predictions that it will try to run the 
country Soviet-style, maintained Monday that it will stick to free-market 
reforms and tight spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tough financial policy will not be eased to any degree," Prime Minister 
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin said. "Nobody has changed the program of reforms." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander N. Shokhin, the new economics minister, told reporters, "There's no 
basis for the agitation in the media that the government's policy and the 
government's composition have altered." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabinet assertions came in the face of international alarm that the 
resignation of reform architect Yegor T. Gaidar and the possible departure of 
Boris G. Fyodorov, the tightfisted finance minister, presage a shift away from 
the radical reforms of the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernomyrdin is pushing for increased subsidies to industry and agriculture to 
boost plummeting production, while the Gaidar camp complains that freer 
spending will bring to naught all attempts to control inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is based on economic figures, the battle over the free-market 
reforms increasingly appears to be political. 
</P>
<P>
 Shokhin complained that Gaidar's supporters were purposely besmirching the 
government to discredit it in a "serious political game" aimed at "organizing a 
nationwide political strike in April or May, overthrowing the government and 
taking power." 
</P>
<P>
 In a reminder of the hopeless economic confusion that reigned under Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Russian government is now planning to work 
out plans for the reforms' continuation in a competition among various teams of 
economists. 
</P>
<P>
 Shokhin said that the teams, which include groups headed by Gorbachev-era 
economists Leonid Abalkin, Nikolai Petrakov and Stanislav Shatalin, will 
present their plans to the government in February and that the government will 
"generalize" them into one program. 
</P>
<P>
 Abalkin and Petrakov "are the most worrisome factor," said economist Pavel 
Bunich. "They are inclined to reverse the movement of the entire economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Shokhin, a former Gaidar ally who has shifted toward somewhat less radical 
reform, explained that when the new Cabinet talks about "non-monetarist" 
methods of improving the economy, it does not mean a return to the Soviet style 
of running the country by fiat with set wages, fixed prices and state-run 
supply networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, it means focusing more on ways to back up budget cuts with 
financial discipline -- by improving tax collection and making sure that 
government money for industry and agriculture reaches its targets instead of 
ending up in factories' foreign bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must dramatically increase the revenues coming into the treasury, perhaps 
even by resorting to administrative methods -- that is, to order all 
enterprises to report all their accounts, including overseas accounts, in 
filing their tax declarations," Shokhin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that 1994 is likely to be the year when Russia's 5 million 
"hidden unemployed" -- people on unpaid vacations and shortened workweeks at 
troubled businesses -- become real unemployed and that the government has to be 
prepared to spend what it takes to avoid a "social explosion." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabinet, and President Boris N. Yeltsin as well, became more willing to 
dilute the reforms after the Dec. 12 elections, in which Russians' economic 
hardship translated into far more votes for ultranationalist Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky's party than for Gaidar's reformers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin met with Chernomyrdin on Monday for talks that reportedly dealt with 
the still-pending government budget for 1994. The Russian president had also 
been expected to meet with Fyodorov to discuss his resignation, but the meeting 
apparently never happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Fyodorov has said he will stay in the government only if a Communist deputy 
prime minister and the head of Russia's Central Bank are removed. Yeltsin has 
not agreed to his conditions but has also seemed to reject Fyodorov's 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar resigned Jan. 16, complaining that he was being held responsible for 
the economy while being denied the power to carry out his policies. The Russian 
government's two top Western advisers, economists Jeffrey Sachs and Anders 
Aslund, also quit last week, saying they could not work with the new Old Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Washington on Monday, the Clinton Administration's top Russia expert 
urged "patience and steadiness" in U.S. policies toward the reform movement, 
the Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many in the West are concerned that what has sometimes been called the second 
Russian Revolution has failed and that counterrevolution has set in," Strobe 
Talbott, special adviser to the secretary of state on the former Soviet 
republics, told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee.

JUDGE ORDERS PACKWOOD TO GIVE UP DIARIES; ETHICS: OREGON SENATOR'S CLAIMS OF 
RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND TO AVOID SELF-INCRIMINATION ARE REJECTED. RULING IS 
VICTORY FOR INVESTIGATING PANEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In another rebuff to embattled Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), a federal judge 
Monday ordered him to turn over personal diaries to the Senate Ethics Committee 
for its investigation of charges that he sexually harassed more than 20 women. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled against Packwood's claims 
that a Senate subpoena for the last five years of his memoirs would violate his 
constitutional right to privacy and to avoid self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson decided that the diaries were "unquestionably relevant" to the Ethics 
Committee's inquiry into possible misconduct by the 61-year-old senator and 
said that special procedures can be imposed for reviewing them that would give 
reasonable protection to Packwood's privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood and his lawyer, Jacob A. Stein, withheld immediate comment on the 
decision -- a victory for the Ethics Committee in its three-month battle over 
access to Packwood's diaries. In the past, the Oregon Republican has indicated 
that he would appeal court rulings against him to the Supreme Court, if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Jackson scheduled a hearing Thursday to discuss procedures for 
inspection of the diary entries by investigators for the Senate panel. The 
diaries, consisting of tape recordings made by Packwood and transcripts of 
them, have been in the court's possession for weeks. Jackson ordered them 
turned over to the court to prevent tampering after the senator's part-time 
transcribing secretary said that she had discovered alterations in some of the 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ruling, Packwood would be required to turn over diaries from Jan. 1, 
1989, to the present under safeguards against leaks suggested by the Ethics 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the material sought to be examined is acknowledged to be extremely 
personal and private in nature and merits an appropriately exalted degree of 
constitutional protection, the manner in which the Ethics Committee will review 
these diaries respects Sen. Packwood's legitimate expectations of privacy and 
is, therefore, 'reasonable. . . . ' " Jackson held. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, Sen. Packwood enjoys no Fifth Amendment privilege to avoid 
surrendering his personal diaries to the Ethics Committee, the act itself 
presenting no risk of incrimination beyond that he has already reduced to 
written or recorded form," the judge added. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee began a preliminary inquiry last Feb. 4 into allegations that 
Packwood made unwanted sexual advances to female staff aides, lobbyists and 
others over two decades. While declaring that some of his conduct was "plain 
wrong," Packwood declined to discuss specific charges. 
</P>
<P>
 During the inquiry, Packwood allowed the ethics panel to examine earlier diary 
entries but he balked when Senate investigators expressed interest in writings 
that indicated he had asked lobbyists to provide a job for his estranged wife. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point he halted cooperation with the committee and defied a subpoena 
for the diaries, setting off a two-day debate on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate, by a vote of 94 to 5, upheld the ethics panel's request and 
authorized it to seek court enforcement of the subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department also issued a subpoena for the diaries shortly after 
friends of Packwood said that he was considering resigning from the Senate seat 
he has held since 1969, an act that would have freed him to destroy the diaries 
if he wished. Since then, however, Packwood has declared that he intends to 
remain in office to fight the charges against him, despite demands by several 
senators that he step down.

AGENT TELLS OF RETRIEVING BODIES AFTER WACO SHOOTOUT 
</P>

<P>
 A federal agent testifying Monday in the murder trial of 11 Branch Davidians 
described how he climbed, wounded, to the roof of the cult compound during a 
cease-fire Feb. 28 to retrieve the bodies two colleagues slain in the gun 
battle with the cult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said . . . 'We need to go back and get our dead,' " said Gerald Petrilli, 
who was wounded in the hands and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Four agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were killed and 16 
were wounded in the 45-minute firefight, which led to a 51-day standoff between 
David Koresh's followers and law enforcement officers. Six Branch Davidians are 
believed to have died in the gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Koresh and about 80 followers died April 19 when a fire engulfed the compound 
outside Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrilli said he saw Conway LeBleu on the roof, then "rolled him over. He had 
a 12-gauge shotgun clutched in his hands. He was dead." He said Todd McKeehan 
also was still holding his gun when agents took his body from the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Agent Larry Shiver, who was wounded in both legs, limped into court and 
testified that he saw shots fired at an ATF medic who attempted to reach slain 
agent Steven Willis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I basically told the medic there was no use in coming any further," Shiver 
said, wiping away tears. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 defendants being tried on murder and murder conspiracy charges could 
face up to life in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys say their clients were acting in self-defense. The 
government says the agents were attempting to search for illegal weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have displayed a cache of nearly 400 firearms recovered from the 
burned compound, but have not said whether they are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to previous testimony, 76 officers poured out of trailers driven up 
to the compound on Feb. 28. About two dozen more were in nearby houses.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON NEEDS STATE OF THE UNION TO JOLT A STATE OF MOTION; 
SPEECH: SINCE CONGRESS RECESSED, THE PRESIDENT HAS WADED INTO A BOG OF BOTHERS. 
TONIGHT HE HOPES TO PULL AHEAD ON HEALTH CARE AND OTHER PRIORITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, who takes the short ride from the White House to the 
Capitol tonight to deliver his State of the Union address, is a man in search 
of momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 He needs it badly to realize his ambitious agenda for the coming year, which 
centers on the plan to remake the nation's health care system and also includes 
an effort to renew the country's violence-torn spirit and other initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration ended 1993 with a flurry of legislative successes, from an 
unexpectedly strong victory on the North American Free Trade Agreement to a 
satisfying defeat of Republicans and the National Rifle Assn. on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nine weeks since Congress adjourned, however, Clinton has been hit with 
new revelations about his private life. He has been compelled to acquiesce in 
the appointment of a special counsel to investigate his involvement in the 
Whitewater development deal. And, after a largely upbeat round of summitry in 
Europe and the former Soviet Union, he was forced into an embarrassing scramble 
for a new defense secretary when Bobby Ray Inman bailed out with a blizzard of 
bizarre accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, the sense of urgency and public pressure for change that helped 
bring Clinton victories last year has seeped away. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, his popularity appears undented. His 55% approval rating in the 
latest Los Angeles Times Poll is as high as at any point in his presidency 
since shortly after his inauguration a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But his legislative wish list pushes the limits of the possible, especially in 
a congressional election year. He wants to reform the health care and welfare 
systems, win more aid for Russia, stiffen penalties for crime and put more 
police on the street, and overhaul the rules of campaign finance and lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he confronts a tightening budget, with some in his own party 
calling for further spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent setbacks have taken a toll on Clinton's political fortunes on 
Capitol Hill, where he cannot count on his own majority party for unwavering 
support for initiatives that drive wedges between the party's ideological 
wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the deterioration of the Administration's position more clear than 
on health care reform. As last year's congressional session closed, a consensus 
seemed to be forming that major changes were inevitable. Now that is far from 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats in Congress appear to be laying the groundwork for something far 
less comprehensive. "We're not going to do the Clinton plan," one senior 
Democratic congressional aide said bluntly. "The Clinton plan is terrifying to 
legislators and it is terrifying to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), whose 
panel has principal jurisdiction over health care reform in the Senate, 
delivered what is perhaps the deepest wound by echoing GOP contentions that the 
nation's health system is not in crisis after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, meanwhile, have become emboldened in their criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last September, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) was 
endorsing a GOP-sponsored health care proposal that is almost as sweeping as 
the President's and warning that his party would suffer if it was perceived as 
a roadblock to reform. 
</P>
<P>
 While Dole still officially supports the broadest Republican proposal, he also 
is sponsoring a much narrower one. "The more (lawmakers) learn about how vast 
this change would be, I think they are going to come back here saying maybe we 
ought to slow down a little bit," Dole told a group of reporters last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's allies hope he can quickly regain the form that led to his victories 
on the budget, gun control and NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look back at the highlights of his first year, his greatest successes 
occurred when he was able to generate the kind of public attention and support 
for his policies that moved the Congress," said Sen. Thomas A. Daschle 
(D-S.D.), a member of the Senate Democratic leadership and the Finance 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, Clinton will try to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to use the occasion of the set-piece State of the Union speech to 
re-establish himself as the tribune of the embattled middle class by delivering 
a message of moral rebirth, according to White House officials. 
</P>
<P>
 George Stephanopoulos, senior adviser to the President, said the speech would 
be both programmatic and thematic. Clinton's plan for the coming year is to 
seize the high ground on health care, crime, welfare and other pressing social 
issues and leave the legislative log-rolling to lesser officials and 
congressional leaders, Stephanopoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main focus will be that we are making progress, renewing the country and 
keeping the commitments we've made," he said in an interview. "You have to 
remember this is really his first State of the Union and he will use the chance 
to talk about the journey he's been on with the American people since the 
election and report to them on what he's done as well." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to focusing new attention on health care and other priority 
topics, Clinton will try to use the speech to defuse a potential controversy 
over delay of his welfare reform proposals to allow his health care program to 
take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearful that it would alienate liberals it needs for the health reform vote, 
the Administration had held back on the welfare package that, among other 
changes, would put a deadline on how long recipients could draw benefits. In 
recent days, however, complaints about the delay from Republicans and some 
Democrats -- most notably Moynihan -- have prodded the Administration back 
toward faster action. Clinton will emphasize that he plans to submit welfare 
reform legislation by mid-April, giving Congress time to vote on it this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the shift is partially rhetorical. Administration officials are sticking 
with their insistence that Congress first work on health care, which Clinton 
believes is the more urgent problem. And while congressional leaders say that 
action on welfare will be possible this year, others are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanopoulos, pointing to poll results that show little loss of support for 
Clinton since mid-December, said that he did not believe that the White House 
needed to regain momentum after a difficult month. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not really fair," he said, noting that Congress had been out of 
session so that Administration bills could not move forward. He described 
Clinton's summit meetings in Western Europe and Russia as successful, adding 
that "people think the President is doing a pretty good job." 
</P>
<P>
 But Republican pollster and political analyst Frank Luntz argues that 
Clinton's political prognosis is mixed at best. 
</P>
<P>
 He says Clinton enters the new year with five chief strengths and five 
offsetting weaknesses. The advantages: his empathy for common people, his 
communication skills, an economy that is improving with little government 
intervention, a strong team of political advisers and White House leadership on 
the health care issue. 
</P>
<P>
 His shortcomings, in Luntz's view, are questions about his character and 
integrity, a string of broken promises to middle-class voters, a poor record on 
foreign policy, lack of a comprehensive anti-crime package and public doubts 
about the Administration's health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet with Clinton's come-from-behind victories last year on the budget, NAFTA 
and gun control, his opponents in Congress have learned the power of the 
President's sheer determination to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "That which he had to do, he did very effectively," said former GOP Rep. Bill 
Frenzel, who assisted the White House on its NAFTA effort. "Having shown that 
he can win those tough ones, nobody's going to underestimate him for a while."

UP TO 133 TIED TO SCANDAL AT NAVAL ACADEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighty-one Naval Academy students confessed to cheating and as many as 133 
midshipmen may have had an advance look at a 1992 electrical engineering test, 
a Navy report released Monday said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the midshipmen involved "repeatedly lied until confronted with 
irrefutable proof of their involvement," said the report, which criticized the 
Naval Academy's handling of its largest cheating scandal ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy Secretary John Dalton removed the academy from further involvement in the 
investigation because of a widespread perception among midshipmen that the 
original investigation was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of midshipmen interviewed did not feel truth was found, or even 
seriously sought," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rear Adm. Thomas C. Lynch, the academy superintendent, did not respond to 
questions about the handling of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said many midshipmen believe that Lynch, a former academy football 
player, gave special treatment to a football player who was cleared of cheating 
even though a midshipmen honor board determined that he had cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was conducted by the Navy Inspector General's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also said many midshipmen do not live up to the honor code, which 
says they must not lie, steal, cheat or tolerate such actions by their 
classmates.

'3-TIME LOSER' BILL A POLITICAL WINNER, BUT CRITICS ABOUND; CRIME: CLINTON IS 
EXPECTED TO BACK THE PLAN FOR MANDATORY SENTENCES IN HIS SPEECH TO CONGRESS. 
PROSECUTORS AND PRISON OFFICIALS SEE DRAWBACKS.

 While lawmakers are sure to applaud President Clinton's expected State of the 
Union endorsement tonight of legislation that would require those convicted of 
three felonies to spend the rest of their lives in prison, many law enforcement 
specialists question the measure's value in crime prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and prison directors said they fear such a law would mean life 
terms for many more lower-level drug dealers or drug addicts than for the 
violent criminals who are targets of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, who spent 15 years as a prosecutor, has expressed 
only qualified support for the idea, which calls for sentencing all violent 
offenders to life in prison after their third conviction. "It depends on how 
it's structured," she said recently of the Senate-passed provision described as 
"three strikes and you're out." 
</P>
<P>
 While they realize they are bucking strong political winds, critics of the 
"three-time loser" bill and other mandatory sentencing measures expect to make 
their case next month at House hearings on the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism also is likely at the American Bar Assn.'s "summit on crime and 
violence" this week in Washington. The ABA and 27 other organizations involved 
in criminal justice have called for an end to mandatory minimum sentences. They 
say the mandates result in "irrationality, disparity and discrimination in the 
enforcement of criminal laws, and decrease certainty and deterrence in 
sentencing." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew L. Sonner, state's attorney for Montgomery County, Md., who has been in 
elective office 23 years, said he understands the politics of the "three-time 
loser" provision but regards it as off-target. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been shown in the last 12 years that imprisoning more people is 
solving our problem," Sonner said. "There's a huge price tag on it, and you 
can't build these prisons overnight. . . . We'll be getting a lot of punishment 
out of it but not much crime prevention." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver J. Keller, past president of the American Correctional Assn., declared: 
"Many of the people who wind up with mandatory sentences are small-time drug 
dealers who are taking up valuable prison space. This country has been on a 
prison-building binge for over 20 years, and if that were the answer (to 
crime), we'd be crime-free by now." 
</P>
<P>
 It now costs about $20,000 a year to keep each prisoner locked up, Keller 
said, so initial construction costs are only a fraction of the tax funds spent 
on prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph D. Lehman, commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, 
said that lawmakers are taking the responsibility for setting sentences from 
judges without being able to consider cases on an individual basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unfortunate thing is we politicize the issue so much," Lehman said. 
"Congress needs to be aware that it's going from punishment to preventive 
detention on the basis of what we think someone's going to do in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of mandatory sentences, along with some sentencing guidelines, 
has resulted in sending too many people to prison, Lehman contended. He said 
that Pennsylvania recorded a 171% increase in incarceration from 1980 to 1990 
after showing virtually no increase in the previous 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel L. Feldman, who chairs the Correction Committee of the New York State 
Assembly, argued that the law would move in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only rational approach is to use prison space far more efficiently than 
we have been doing," he said. "We should be locking up violent criminals far 
longer than we are doing . . . rather than locking up so many street dealers of 
drugs who are instantly replaceable." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Wallace, special counsel to the National Legal Aid and Defender Assn., 
warned that "three-time loser" laws eventually would make prisons look like 
nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have a nation with geriatric prisoners -- comatose guys in 
oxygen tents -- and nobody will be able to turn those guys loose until they 
die," Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the criticisms, however, the Clinton-backed provision is among the 
most politically appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), chairman of the Democratic Caucus, cheered on the 
President: "Those individuals who have been convicted of three separate violent 
crimes have forfeited their rights to be members of our society. They should be 
off our streets, in jail, forever, never to plague us again."

NEWS ANALYSIS; LOW-KEY PERRY BEING ASKED TO MASTER HIGH-FLYING JOB; PENTAGON: 
NOMINEE FOR TOP DEFENSE POST WAS CONSIDERED IDEAL AS NO. 2 MAN. NOW HE HAS TO 
SHOW HE CAN SHAPE BOLD NATIONAL POLICY AND SELL IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Clinton Administration first considered William J. Perry for a top 
Defense Department job a little more than a year ago, the low-key Stanford 
University engineering professor seemed the perfect choice -- for the 
Pentagon's No. 2 slot. 
</P>
<P>
 The quiet-spoken mathematician was regarded as a careful manager, capable of 
running the day-to-day operations of a huge department. He was a recognized 
authority on crucial issues, such as military technology and arms control. And 
he was highly respected on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, nominated by the President to be secretary of defense after the 
embarrassing withdrawal by Bobby Ray Inman, the 66-year-old Perry still must 
overcome the perception that he is better suited to be second-in-command than 
the Pentagon's chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Californian is widely credited with having done a workmanlike job 
as deputy secretary of defense, even friends conceded that he is largely 
untested in the realm of shaping policy for the nation's future security and 
selling it to Congress and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 He also lacks the "star" persona and political stature that some White House 
officials had said Clinton was seeking to help him regain credibility with the 
military and to serve as a forceful spokesman for Administration policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that he's going to have to broaden himself," a onetime colleague 
said of Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 There is considerable skepticism in some quarters about whether Perry will be 
able to exert the kind of forceful influence within the Administration's 
policy-making team that some say is needed. Clinton's relations with the armed 
services remain uneasy at best. And, beyond the Pentagon, there is continuing 
criticism of the Administration's handling of immediate crises such as Bosnia 
and its efforts to shape a comprehensive strategy for national security in the 
post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Snider, a military analyst with the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies, said that Perry is apt to find it "hard to work in that kind of 
Cabinet with that kind of entree. It diminishes the stature of defense within 
the Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it is not even clear what new policies the secretary-designate would 
be likely to promote. Although Perry's outlook on technology and defense 
procurement are well-enough known, virtually no one is familiar with his views 
on broader defense and foreign policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said that he has agreed with outgoing Defense Secretary Les Aspin on 
most of the new policies that he has put into effect. "I don't think you're 
going to see many major changes," one longtime friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, supporters insisted that Perry may prove to be a sleeper when it 
comes to strengthening the Administration's national security team. Although 
Perry has concentrated mainly on overhauling the Pentagon's Byzantine 
procurement system this past year, he also has become more conversant with 
issues ranging from budget priorities to military preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 John D. Steinbruner, a Brookings Institution defense expert who has known 
Perry for years, said that behind the new nominee's friendly demeanor and 
straightforward style is a man with a clear vision about how to resolve 
long-term problems and the determination to follow through. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tendency to believe that nice guys can't accomplish anything," 
Steinbruner conceded. "But he has a lot of competence and sense of purpose and 
he's not easily deflected. When he decides to do something, he's formidable." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, defense analysts pointed out that Perry is one of the few Democrats 
that Clinton could have named who have built reputations in the defense arena. 
The rest already are in lesser slots in the Defense Department or the Central 
Intelligence Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 And Perry clearly was the favorite of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had been 
fearful that Inman -- who withdrew his name from nomination last week after 
complaining of excessive criticism from the press -- might concentrate too much 
on intelligence issues. Inman had a long career as a senior intelligence 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 A brainy yet pragmatic man, Perry was undersecretary of defense for research 
and engineering during the late 1970s, playing a key role in launching the 
development of radar-evading Stealth aircraft that performed so well during the 
Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 He later served as director of Stanford's Center for International Security 
and Arms Control and headed Technology Strategies and Alliances, a Menlo Park 
consulting firm. In the early 1980s, he managed Hambrecht & Quist, an 
investment firm specializing in high technology. 
</P>
<P>
 During his 10 months as deputy secretary, he has become a leading advocate of 
defense procurement reform, calling for greatly simplified contract regulations 
in an effort to make government practices more like those in the commercial 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his proposals, the military services would buy commercial products off 
the shelf wherever feasible, rather than pay extra for custom designs. And he 
has promoted efforts to keep critical defense industries alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Once confirmed, Perry would face a broad array of challenges: He would have to 
help hammer out a more coherent, broad-scale foreign policy, manage the 
continuing reduction in the size of the military without sacrificing readiness 
and deal with day-to-day problems, such as Bosnia and Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry told the Senate Armed Services Committee during a confirmation hearing 
last year that the biggest challenge facing the Pentagon is how to sustain 
military preparedness in the face of the current effort to reduce the size of 
the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 But he eschewed any quick-fix solutions, saying only: "We have never 
successfully managed a drawdown of this size."

HEALTH INSURERS AND WHITE HOUSE AIDES CONFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Top White House officials met Monday with representatives of the Health 
Insurance Assn. of America, among the harshest critics of the President's 
health care reform agenda, in a search for common ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-minute meeting, arranged by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of 
the House Ways and Means Committee, may herald something of a detente between 
the Clinton Administration and the insurance organization. The association 
represents most of the nation's smaller insurance companies and has already 
poured nearly $10 million into an advertising campaign critical of health care 
reform that has infuriated the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting also was widely seen by analysts as part of an accelerated White 
House effort to reach out amid new signs that there may be less business 
support for the President's reforms than the White House had assumed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent round of meetings with chiefs of corporations the White House had 
thought were supportive, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton instead was told 
about their serious reservations, informed sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The White House clearly is beginning to reach out in a way that it had not 
before," said onetime Clinton adviser Bruce Fried, now an independent analyst 
and health care lobbyist. "These discussions with the insurance and business 
communities seem to indicate a renewed effort by the Administration to find a 
consensus among the major interests in the health care debate." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior presidential assistant Monday put little stock in the expressions of 
doubt by the business leaders, ascribing their motives to posturing for 
bargaining leverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The aide also downplayed the meeting, which included former Willis D. Gradison 
Jr., a former congressman who heads the insurance association, White House 
Deputy Chief of Staff Harold M. Ickes and senior Clinton advisers Ira Magaziner 
and George Stephanopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really just an attempt to begin to understand each other," the aide 
said, noting that Gradison and Magaziner met several times in 1993, although 
have not since the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's meeting raised eyebrows because the Administration and the insurance 
association were bitterly at odds throughout Clinton's first year in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the association aired a series of television ads featuring a couple 
who attacked what they called excessive big government, restrictions on 
consumer choices of physicians and caps on insurance premiums under Clinton's 
plan.

TEACHERS GROUP CALLS SIGOLOFF UNQUALIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's largest teacher organization announced Monday that it opposes Gov. 
Pete Wilson's appointment of Los Angeles businessman Sanford C. Sigoloff as 
state superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have found no evidence that Mr. Sigoloff has the qualifications or the 
experience or that he meets any of the major normal and customary 
prerequisites" to be state schools chief, announced D.A. (Del) Weber, president 
of the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber also said that Sigoloff, if approved by the Legislature, would serve in 
the position less than a year. "He would have, at best, a minimum amount of 
time for on-the-job training and that is not sufficient to warrant 
confirmation," Weber said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber described Sigoloff, a physicist by training, as "extremely articulate" 
but said he failed to demonstrate the background needed to handle the 
"extraordinarily complicated duty" of providing education to 6 million 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigoloff, 63, a corporate turnaround wizard, was nominated by Wilson in 
November after the schoolteachers union helped scuttle the governor's first 
choice for the post, Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach). Wilson has been 
trying to fill the spot since former Supt. Bill Honig was forced to step down 
last spring after his conviction on conflict-of-interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigoloff, who does not plan to run for the superintendent's job in this year's 
election, said he was not surprised by the CTA's action. "It would have taken 
enormous courage for them to do anything else," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he described the decision as "disappointing" and "an indication of how 
fearful they are of challenging the status quo. If we are to get our schools 
back on track, we must be willing to accept change." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, because of the short time left in the vacancy, indications were 
that Sigoloff would win confirmation. But the CTA opposition is a setback for 
Sigoloff, especially among Democrats who rely on the teachers group for 
campaign support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It clearly doesn't help his cause," said Assembly Republican Leader Jim 
Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga. "There are a lot of members of the Democratic 
caucus who don't do anything that the CTA doesn't like." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brulte said that although Democrats turned opposition to the Bergeson 
nomination into a highly partisan fight, he has "not heard that same drumbeat 
against Mr. Sigoloff." 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Majority Leader Thomas Hannigan (D-Fairfield) agreed that the CTA 
action has "some significance" but that he expects a special committee he 
chairs to conduct a fair and balanced hearing on Sigoloff. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a Feb. 16 deadline for legislative action, the Senate Education 
Committee has set an informational hearing for next Tuesday to quiz Sigoloff on 
education issues. The next day, Hannigan's committee plans a broader hearing, 
including a look at Sigoloff's background.

JUSTICES RULE JUVENILES CAN BE HELD LONGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court held Monday that juveniles can be detained for as 
long as 72 hours without a judicial determination that their arrest was 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 The divided court ruled on a case in Los Angeles County, where juveniles 
arrested without a warrant can be held for 72 hours without a judicial 
determination that there was probable cause for the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect innocent people who are arrested by overzealous police, the U.S. 
Supreme Court ruled in 1991 that suspects must be released if their arrest is 
not reviewed by a judge within 48 hours. But the high court did not 
specifically say that the protection should be afforded to juveniles as well as 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 In the California case, Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas, writing the majority 
opinion, justified the county policy for holding juveniles by noting that 
youngsters enjoy more protections than adults after their arrest. For example, 
the law requires immediate release of the child to a parent or guardian unless 
certain factors exist. 
</P>
<P>
 But three of the court's seven members dissented. Justice Ronald M. George 
said that a juvenile's case should be promptly reviewed by a judge because "the 
consequences of even a relatively brief, wrongful incarceration are likely to 
be more detrimental and long-lasting to an an innocent, vulnerable child than 
to an innocent adult." 
</P>
<P>
 But Frederick R. Bennett, assistant Los Angeles County counsel, said it makes 
sense to treat juveniles differently because the criminal justice system 
affords them more safeguards than adults.

STORM SENDS QUAKE VICTIMS SEARCHING FOR MAKESHIFT COVER; WEATHER: PEOPLE IN 
FILLMORE AND SIMI VALLEY GRAB PLASTIC TO PROTECT DAMAGED HOMES AND BELONGINGS. 
TWO OIL SPILLS ARE WORRISOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Earthquake victims in Fillmore and Simi Valley covered their belongings and 
damaged homes with plastic and tarps as rain began falling Monday night in 
Ventura County with showers expected to linger through this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley hardware stores reported brisk sales of plastic and other 
waterproof covering materials as owners of damaged properties sought to plug 
holes inflicted by last week's earthquake. Crews worked through the day in 
Fillmore to protect buildings against wet weather. 
</P>
<P>
 The wet storm that originated in the Gulf of Alaska also brought winds and 
colder temperatures, with nighttime lows Monday night and tonight expected to 
dip into the low 30s inland and into the 40s along the coast. Daytime 
temperatures should reach into the 50s and low 60s. 
</P>
<P>
 But after this morning's scattered showers, forecasters said skies are 
expected to clear, bringing a return to warmer temperatures Wednesday. No 
further rain is expected later this week, meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Fillmore placed huge rolls of clear plastic sheeting at St. 
Francis Catholic Church, where residents were snipping off sections early 
Monday to prepare for the rain. The city also provided nails and wooden strips 
for residents to secure the plastic sheeting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city's two emergency shelters were full with about 300 people on Saturday 
night, when rain was forecast but did not materialize, said Bob Buckles, 
Fillmore evacuation center supervisor. He said up to 1,000 people were expected 
in the shelters Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the city and the Red Cross were planning to bring in extra tents 
or drape tarps around an outdoor area at Fillmore Middle School to accommodate 
any overflow. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're about out of indoor facilities," Buckles said. "We'll have to start 
putting them outdoors. We definitely do not want to turn people away." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, the emergency shelter at Royal High School has been providing 
beds for about 100 people, and more were expected Monday night. However, 
shelter operators said the building's capacity is 350 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Darby, manager of the Federal Emergency Management Agency center in Simi 
Valley, said the chilly and wet weather provided an extra incentive to move 
people quickly through the aid application process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving people as fast as we can every day, but (the impending storm) is 
a factor," he said. "It gets cold at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardware stores were selling hundreds of tarpaulins, sheets of plastic and 
other makeshift repair materials, employees said. At the Holiday Hardware store 
on Tapo Street, customer Steve Cherry said his Simi Valley condominium had 
suffered major damage, forcing him, his wife and infant daughter into a motel. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, "the rain doesn't scare me," he said. "So things get a little 
wet. So what? It's all got to be replaced anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Kerr was among many Simi Valley residents whose homes sustained major 
damage. On Monday, he and his son were covering the house with sheets of orange 
plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to keep this thing as livable as possible," he said. "We're 
just trying to cope." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The coming rain also caused concern for crews working to clean up an oil spill 
along 12 to 15 miles of the Santa Clara River east of Piru. They feared that 
the contamination from the remaining oil could spread if heavy rain pushes it 
downstream. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 people were working on the spill Monday. More than 600 fish and 
at least 20 birds and other animals have died so far. Another 22 birds, as well 
as a pond turtle and a Western toad, were found alive but coated with oil. 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Fish and Game officials said the agency may increase 
the estimate of oil spilled above the original 168,000 gallons after its 
investigation is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Arco, parent company of Four Corners Pipeline, reduced its 
estimate of oil recovered to 58,000 gallons after an analysis of material 
vacuumed up from the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still a lot of oil in the river," said Reed Smith of the Fish and 
Game Department. "It will take weeks to clean this up." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that if rainfall in the area is limited to half an inch to an inch 
as forecast, the ground should be able to absorb the water and prevent the oil 
from being pushed further downstream. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain could also raise the water level at tiny McGrath Lake, where an oil 
spill discovered on Christmas Day coated the lake and surrounding wetlands with 
heavy crude. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Rojas, chief ranger for the California State Parks Channel Coast 
District, said the rain could damage more vegetation as the "bathtub ring" of 
oil that clings to the edges of the lake moves up.  
</P>

SERIOUS CRIMES IN OXNARD FALL TO 20-YEAR LOW DURING 1993; LAW ENFORCEMENT: 
AUTHORITIES CREDIT AN INCREASE IN CITIZENS' PATROLS AND COMMUNITY-BASED 
POLICING EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After increasing dramatically over the previous three years, the number of 
serious crimes reported in Oxnard plunged in 1993 to a 20-year low, authorities 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and city officials credit the drop to a boom in citizens' patrols and a 
variety of community-based policing efforts, including two storefront stations, 
a weekly cable TV show and graffiti cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
 And while crime statistics can swing wildly from year to year, police say last 
year's crime-rate decline is significant because both the violent and property 
crime categories are down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what really happened is that we saw a significant increase in 
community involvement," said Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt. "The partnership 
I always talk about, I think it really began to jell here in Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Oxnard reported a total of 58 crimes per 1,000 residents, the lowest 
such figure since at least 1973, said David Keith, a Police Department crime 
analyst. In 1992, there were 69.3 crimes per 1,000 people and the 1991 rate was 
68.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez said he hopes the 1993 figures will chip away at the city's 
reputation as the gang, drug and murder capital of the county. The reputation 
has long been unfair, he said, because the city's diverse population has more 
social and economic problems than other Ventura County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're comparing apples to apples, I think we have a pretty good record. 
And I think it's getting even better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, officials say the city's gang and drug problems show no signs of 
retreating. Countywide crime figures for 1993 are not yet available to show 
whether Oxnard will retain its status as the most crime-ridden city in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said the lower crime figures held steady throughout the year, 
although they were much more apparent in areas where residents have organized 
street patrols. In those neighborhoods, crime dropped an average of 55%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Combined homicides, rapes, robberies and felony assaults fell 11%. Property 
crime -- burglaries, thefts, arsons and auto thefts -- decreased 14% overall, 
despite slight jumps in auto theft and arson. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith said the drop in burglaries -- from 2,134 in 1992 to 1,615 in 1993 -- is 
the clearest sign that citizens' patrols are deterring certain types of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think our neighborhood patrols are going to bring down the murder 
rate in the city," he said. "But they are going to have an impact on things 
like residential burglary, auto burglary and auto theft." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the number of citizens' patrols in Oxnard blossomed from one on the 
city's northern border to a network of 14 spread throughout the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Fox, an Oxnard podiatrist, helped found a patrol in the Sea-Aire 
neighborhood last February after he grew tired of seeing gang members instead 
of residents on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we see people walking their dogs or taking their children out for walks 
in the evening," he said. "More people are in the park. The walls are cleaner 
and we don't get as much graffiti on our buildings and on our block walls." 
</P>
<P>
 And while many cities remain wary of encouraging citizens to take to the 
streets armed with walkie-talkies and high-powered flashlights, Oxnard's City 
Council recently called for 10 more areas to form patrol groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're part of the solution it just works better," Mayor Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to patrols, police officials say two storefront stations -- a 
year-old facility in La Colonia and a newer one in the Southwinds area -- have 
helped clean up some of the most dangerous corners of town. 
</P>
<P>
 As in La Colonia, the Southwinds neighborhood saw a big drop in crime in the 
three months following the storefront's opening and the establishment of 
walking patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall crime in Southwinds fell 49% in the last three months of 1993. There 
were one-third the number of auto burglaries and half the number of car thefts.

COURT ALLOWS ABORTION SUITS UNDER RICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court gave abortion providers a new legal weapon Monday by ruling 
that militant foes of abortion can be forced to pay crippling damage verdicts 
if they are found to have led a campaign of violence and threats against 
abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-0 decision reinstates a lawsuit filed by the National Organization for 
Women against Joseph Scheidler and his Pro-Life Action League, and Randall 
Terry and his Operation Rescue. The suit charges the abortion opponents with 
leading a nationwide conspiracy to shut abortion clinics through bombings, 
arson, break-ins and threats. 
</P>
<P>
 If the charges are proven, the high court said, Scheidler and his allies 
violated the federal anti-racketeering law and can be required to pay damages 
three times greater than the total losses suffered by the abortion providers. 
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, the ruling also gives government prosecutors the power to use 
the law against any terrorist organization that uses violence for political 
reasons. Similarly, it would permit lawsuits against animal rights activists, 
environmental extremists or others who use force or violence to achieve their 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Most lower courts have dismissed such suits on the grounds that the Racketeer 
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act applies only to mobsters, crooks or 
con artists who prey on legitimate business. Since the abortion foes acted for 
moral reasons, not for "an economic motive," a federal appeals court in Chicago 
had dismissed NOW's suit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, concluded that 
the 1970 law does not require that criminals be motivated by money. 
</P>
<P>
 The law covers "any enterprise . . . individual (or) association" which 
engages in a pattern of criminal activity, such as robbery, murder, arson, 
fraud, drug dealing or the use of violence and threatened force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowhere in (the language of the law) is there any indication that an economic 
motive is required," Rehnquist said. A targeted group "need only be an 
association in fact that engages in a pattern of racketeering activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's ruling is also noteworthy because the legal outcome is not 
necessarily in line with the personal preferences of the justices. Several of 
them, including Rehnquist, have repeatedly expressed concern about the broad 
reach of the RICO law. While the justices have urged Congress to amend the law, 
they have also said that they have no authority to rewrite it on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally enacted as a weapon to combat organized crime, during the 1980s the 
law became a favored means of attacking regular businesses that engaged in 
fraud. The targets included the executives of failed thrift institutions, 
stockbrokers who deceived customers, city officials who took bribes, even 
accountants, travel agents and insurance sellers who put their names on 
misleading statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics now say that the law has become a dangerous tool in the hands of 
greedy lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices could have invoked the First Amendment and ruled that a 
racketeering suit such as the one in this case violates the free-speech rights 
of abortion foes. But as Rehnquist noted in his opinion in the case (NOW vs. 
Scheidler, 92-780), lawyers for abortion foes did not raise that issue in this 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Given previous interpretations of the RICO law, attorneys for Operation Rescue 
presumably thought that they could win without a First Amendment argument. Now, 
however, as the case returns for trial in Chicago, the anti-abortion leaders 
are free to argue that their activities are protected as free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the justices also announced that they would review a Florida 
judge's order that limited anti-abortion picketing near a clinic. A ruling in 
that case, due by July, should clarify the free-speech rights of the abortion 
foes. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of NOW praised Monday's decision and predicted that it could help 
quell the "escalating anti-abortion terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision allows us to go after the leaders, the kingpins of this 
conspiracy," said Helen Neuborne, executive director of the NOW Legal Defense 
Fund. "We believe we can connect them to these bombings and the other acts of 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Dunn, executive director of Planned Parenthood in Orange County, said the 
issue was not of freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "The murder of Dr. Gunn (shot outside a Pensacola, Fla., clinic in 1992) is 
clearly not an exercise of First Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been peaceful anti-abortion protests in front of the five Planned 
Parenthood clinics in Orange County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We support the right to do that," he said. "The problem is the inflammatory 
rhetoric and tactics of extremists that create a climate of intolerance . . . 
the concern we have is those actions will escalate to violence in Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-abortion lawyers denounced the decision and said they feared that it "may 
bankrupt not only pro-life organizations but other political activists 
throughout the nation," said Clarke Forsythe, general counsel for Americans 
United for Life, who represented Scheidler. Defending itself in the 8-year-old 
case has already cost Pro-Life Action League more than $1 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect a costly abuse of RICO . . . will threaten all activists that 
oppose various businesses," Forsythe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Wright, who worked in the Orange County branch of Operation Rescue from 
1991 to 1992, called the ruling "devastating . . . for any protest group." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our First Amendment rights are thrown out the window," she said. "This is so 
broad in the way it's been defined that any protest group in America is in 
jeopardy of being sued under RICO." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the House and Senate have passed bills that would make it a federal crime 
to block the entrances to an abortion facility. A final version of that 
legislation is expected to gain congressional approval by spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion rights lawyers said that the new measure would permit authorities, 
including federal judges, to intervene against ordinary protesters who break 
the law. Last year, the Supreme Court stripped federal judges of their power to 
intervene in these disputes by ruling that federal civil rights laws do not 
protect women seeking abortion.

CLINTON FOES ENLIST DORNAN IN ASSAULT ON WHITE HOUSE; POLITICS: THE VITRIOLIC 
O.C. CONGRESSMAN HAS BECOME A SHOCK TROOPER FOR CONSERVATIVE CRUSADERS 
NATIONWIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The message that came to Rep. Robert K. Dornan's office last summer sounded 
like it was from a secret agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is No. 5, calling No. 6," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan (R-Garden Grove) was puzzled until he checked the phone number left by 
the caller and found that it was from Little Rock, Ark. A ha, it must be Cliff 
Jackson, an old college buddy of President Clinton's who ranked fifth on a 
nationally published list of the top 10 White House enemies. Dornan was ranked 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 When the two men met a few weeks later at a Riverside restaurant, Jackson 
confided that he was representing several Arkansas state troopers who claimed 
first-hand knowledge of the President's womanizing while he was governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan's instructions were to keep the story secret, because Jackson said he 
expected it would break soon in the national media. But just in case, Dornan 
was to be the "insurance policy" who would guarantee the story got exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that Bob Dornan was a walking time bomb and all I had to do was light 
the fuse," Jackson said recently. "Given his reputation for . . . telling it 
like it is, I felt there was no chance at all that he would be intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan has to give President Clinton some of the credit for his newfound 
national profile as a leading spokesman for the White House antagonists. He has 
long been one of Washington's most tenacious and vitriolic crusaders for 
conservative causes -- anti-communism, anti-taxes, anti-abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with a Democrat in the White House and a series of scandals as 
ammunition, Dornan has locked onto his target like a guided missile. Sometimes 
the attacks come on late-night C-Span broadcasts as Dornan rails against the 
President in red-faced speeches to an empty House of Representatives. Or they 
come when Dornan fills in as the regular guest host for Rush Limbaugh's 
nationally broadcast radio show, where recently he spent three days attacking 
the President for everything from extramarital sex to health care, taxes, the 
deficit and the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "People know, if nobody else will raise the issue, he will," said Paul 
Weyrich, president of the conservative National Empowerment Television in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Dornan is at his suburban Virginia home struggling with a career 
decision. He has yet to announce whether he will run for a ninth term in 
Congress. Instead, at age 60, Dornan said he is considering whether to quit and 
run for the U.S. Senate or launch a career as a radio talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also traveled to New Hampshire, home of the nation's first presidential 
primary, to test the waters for a possible White House campaign in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan hopes to make a decision this week. But whatever his choice, he 
promises his next job will provide a strategic position from which he can 
continue his barrage against the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a career choice to come up with here that is so difficult because 
there is so much action in D.C. now," Dornan said in an interview. "I've got to 
think about the big picture -- what is good for me serving my country." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as history goes, it has yet to be determined whether Dornan will be 
remembered as being famous or infamous. The attention he receives is only 
partly due to his criticism of the President. It is also largely because of his 
talent as a showman and his flair for the outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 White House counsel Vince Foster didn't just commit suicide, Dornan told his 
national radio audience: "He blew his brains out July 20th over here in Marcy 
Park, standing next to an old Civil War cannon." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House staff isn't just misleading people, Dornan told his listeners, 
"they are paid with your tax dollars to destroy the truth, rip the truth, 
deceive you, manipulate . They are totally unfamiliar with the truth. These are 
spin doctors who know the truth and are trying to protect their boss." 
</P>
<P>
 And Dornan doesn't simply charge that Clinton had extramarital affairs. He has 
elaborated the charges with details of alleged sexual encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics complain that he is Howard Stern Goes to Washington, a congressional 
shock jock. Even supporters say they can't believe some of the things he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a form of entertainment for a lot of people," said Bob Nelson, a Dornan 
critic and Republican political consultant who served on the Clinton transition 
team. "There are incredible parallels to Bob Dornan's style and rhetoric and 
former Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy. The whole red-baiting, mudslinging, 
guilt by association tactics are part of the everyday activities of Bob 
Dornan." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, as Dornan guest-hosted the Rush Limbaugh radio show at the same 
time the state troopers' story was breaking, an elderly woman named Mary from 
Lynchburg, Va., called to scold the congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob?  
</P>
<P>
 Yes'm.  
</P>
<P>
 You know what? If I was your mama I would come give you a slap on the head or 
send you to bed without supper because you are bringing no class to the 
conservative party. . . . Do you know if I were a budding conservative, I would 
be turned off by you. Now I'm calling from the hometown of Jerry Falwell, and 
he is very much a conservative. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Oh, I know.  
</P>
<P>
 But I'm sure he is not approving of what you are doing to the Clinton 
Administration. He's the President of the United States. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 All right now, Mary, I understand completely your thoughts and your challenge. 
I said yesterday there's a tabloid aspect to all of this.  
</P>
<P>
 Very much.  
</P>
<P>
 But it's been because Bill Clinton has lived a tabloid life. So it's tough. 
Now all of the papers have vindicated me. This is a headline all across the 
country. I didn't do that, but it is.  
</P>
<P>
 But it's not, Bob. I dispute that. I'm here, I'm watching the talk shows.  
</P>
<P>
 Now wait a minute, Mary. . . . I was raised on George Washington and Gen. 
Douglas MacArthur. My mother would be calling into radio shows. She's watching 
from heaven and I'll tell you, she'd be proud of me because she raised me this 
way.  
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, the White House dismisses Dornan as a kook who is more humorous than 
harmful. But as Clinton has learned, problems don't always arrive through 
mainstream channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Epstein, Clinton's California director at the White House, said he has 
ignored Dornan and is not aware of his most recent accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy is annoying and he's clever and he's going to get attention," Epstein 
said. "But we have to keep our eyes on the prize -- getting our important 
legislation passed -- and Dornan is not a huge impediment to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein added, however, that if a credible candidate could be found to 
challenge Dornan, the White House would "do as much as we could to help." Three 
Democrats have entered the race for Dornan's 46th Congressional District seat, 
and their campaigns are still developing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd love to see him defeated," Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether people dismiss his comments or not, Dornan clearly has access to a lot 
of listeners. And in politics, the ability to communicate equals power. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his national exposure on C-Span and the Rush Limbaugh program, 
Dornan has maintained a nationwide mailing network of supporters who have made 
him one of the top fund-raisers in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, his campaign war chest was among the 10 largest in Congress, and he 
was the only candidate to make the list with less than 5% of his contributions 
from political action committees. In the first six months of 1993, an 
off-election year, Dornan raised more than $260,000, most of it in small 
contributions and little of it from his district. 
</P>
<P>
 David Mason, director of the Congressional Project at the Heritage Foundation, 
a conservative think tank, said the measure of Dornan's influence is not 
whether he appeals to mainstream America. Instead, he said, Dornan should be 
evaluated as a conservative leader and his national influence would depend on 
the power of conservative voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no surprise that liberals would be dismissive of him," he said. "But 
clearly he is a national leader among Republicans. He's not up there with 
(Kansas Sen.) Bob Dole and (Georgia Rep.) Newt Gingrich, but definitely he is 
right behind them." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan launched his first attack against Clinton during the presidential 
campaign in the summer of 1992. He raised questions about why Clinton would 
tour Moscow in 1969 when most college students would be expected to vacation at 
more popular sites in Europe. He also suggested that it is likely the KGB would 
have tried to recruit Clinton while he was in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people deserve to know why he went to Moscow during the height 
of the Vietnam War and what he did there and with whom he met," Dornan charged 
a month before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan had strong ties to former President George Bush. He was the first major 
conservative leader to endorse the then-vice president when Bush won the 
presidency in 1988, and Dornan campaigned for him around the country then and 
in 1992. The congressman said he urged Bush in private meetings to question 
Clinton on the Moscow trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thought makes me sick to have this son of a bitch of such low character 
commanding this country," Dornan said. "Those are my exact words I said to the 
President." 
</P>
<P>
 In early October, Bush suggested on Larry King's CNN talk show that Clinton 
should "level with the American people" about his Moscow visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan's profile as leader of the charge against the Clinton White House has 
sometimes made his office a clearinghouse for sources with tips or rumors about 
the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, the attorney representing the Arkansas state troopers, said he also 
turned to Dornan because of his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 The troopers contacted Jackson last summer as they sought help in releasing 
their story about claims that Clinton had frequent extramarital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson passed the information to the Los Angeles Times and the American 
Spectator, a conservative publication in Washington, and both published the 
information in December. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the fall, Jackson said he and the troopers feared that their lives 
might be threatened because of their accusations against the President. Dornan 
was to be the "insurance policy" in case anything happened to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he took a risk in going to Dornan because of the congressman's 
reputation for hyperbole and his attack-dog tactics. If the story came from 
Dornan, Jackson was concerned that it might be dismissed. "On the other hand, 
you don't want an insurance policy with a namby-pamby politician," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dornan is outspoken. He is not cowed. He expresses things in terms that are 
quite explosive," Jackson said. "He coalesces the feelings of those who are 
already predisposed (against Clinton), while at the same time it may alienate 
those who would listen to a more moderate approach. . . . He does play a role, 
depending on your perspective in the American process."

ANAHEIM WILL GET AID FOR QUAKE LOSS 
</P>

 Gov. Pete Wilson on Monday declared a state of emergency in Orange County, 
paving the way for the city of Anaheim to recover million of dollars in 
earthquake damage at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main reason for the declaration was that the city of Anaheim had filed a 
request because of the major damage in and around the stadium," said Kevin 
Eckery, the governor's press secretary. "The amount of damage outstripped their 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim's request was criticized by some residents and politicians who argued 
that money to repair a scoreboard is not an appropriate use of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), said Monday night of the 
governor's declaration: "I can't believe that. Unless there's some (other) 
damage that I'm totally and completely unaware of, I can't imagine a person in 
the executive leadership, a governor calling that a disaster. It's outrageous. 
. . . Just like everything else, calling something like that a disaster 
depreciates the value of our common English language." 
</P>
<P>
 Although last week's Northridge earthquake was strongly felt in Orange County, 
there was relatively little damage. The most significant occurred at Anaheim 
Stadium, where the quake toppled the 17-ton Sony Jumbotron scoreboard. The 
collapse of the scoreboard caused part of the cantilever above the upper tier 
to cave in, damaging four giant advertising panels and crushing about 1,000 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials have estimated damage at the city-owned stadium at $3 
million to $4 million. Because the city's stadium insurance policy has a 
$6.5-million deductible, the city is potentially liable for those repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the earthquake, the city faced an estimated $8-million budget 
deficit next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley declared the 
county a disaster area and asked the governor to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials said that they were surprised by the criticism and that they 
did not intend to minimize the severity of damage in Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties. They agreed that those who need housing and transportation assistance 
should have priority. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James D. Ruth said last week that the city was only trying to 
protect the taxpayers of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckery said the governor's declaration Monday did not minimize the destruction 
that occurred in Anaheim's neighbors to the north, which were declared disaster 
areas last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's clear that the physical damage is not as great (as in 
Northridge, but) that doesn't mean that the city of Anaheim doesn't need the 
assistance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckery added that assistance to Anaheim could take the form of low-interest 
loans. Furthermore, he said, any assistance that goes to Anaheim "won't be 
taking away money from people in Los Angeles and Ventura counties." 
</P>
<P>
 In his declaration, Wilson said he took the action because "the magnitude of 
this disaster exceeds the capabilities of the services, personnel and 
facilities of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials Monday welcomed the declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased with the fast action by the governor on our request," said 
Mayor Tom Daly. "Anaheim Stadium is an important center of economic activity in 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Irv Pickler said that he too is grateful but that the city will try 
to recoup the financial losses from anyone who might share responsibility for 
the scoreboard falling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure if we find the responsible party, that's where we'll get the money," 
Pickler said. "Obviously the priorities are with the people in Los Angeles and 
Northridge." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's declaration makes the county eligible for mandatory mutual aid 
from other cities, counties and state agencies and provides state reimbursement 
for costs connected with the emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of damaged or destroyed property will get extended property tax 
relief, and low-interest loans will be available from the state for housing 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also requested that President Clinton include Orange County on 
the federal disaster declaration, so Anaheim and other cities in the county can 
seek federal assistance.

DOCTORS TRY TO HEAL BROKEN PRACTICES; HEALTH: PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS FACE 
UNUSABLE OFFICES, WRECKED EQUIPMENT AND ANXIOUS PATIENTS.

 By the time Dr. Farid Farid reached his Sherman Oaks medical office after last 
week's earthquake, the floor was knee-deep in water. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of patient records were scattered everywhere. All the windows were 
broken. There was no telephone service, electricity or heat. And when Farid 
refused to pay a plumber $300 to fix the water heater, the man cut the pipe 
he'd just fixed and left. 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, Farid, a family physician who runs another office near Koreatown, 
was still struggling to get his practice back to normal, trying to reassemble 
his clinics while soothing patients anxious about their next examinations or 
prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're kind of shaky, of course. Nervous wrecks. That's understandable. But 
unless it's a real emergency, high fever or pain, they've had their 
appointments postponed," Farid said. 
</P>
<P>
 His experience is hardly unique. Across Los Angeles, hundreds of doctors, 
dentists and other medical practitioners have seen their offices damaged or 
closed by the quake. Combined with the damage it wreaked on local hospitals, 
the temblor has seriously disrupted the city's medical network. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients have missed kidney dialysis treatments, psychotherapy sessions and 
dental appointments. They have developed infections from untreated cuts and 
been unable to get prescriptions refilled. At some medical offices in the San 
Fernando Valley, the phone goes unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with customers without prescriptions, some pharmacists have given 
away small amounts of non-narcotic drugs. X-rays have been ruined and patient 
files upended, turning records rooms into vast heaps of jumbled paper and 
leaving physicians without vital data about patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything twisted and turned and they all came down," said Doris Skouros of 
the 90-doctor Facey Medical Group in Mission Hills, as she ruefully watched 
more than a dozen workers painstakingly replace thousands of fallen file 
folders on shelves Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hillman, executive director of the Unified Medical Group Assn., a Seal 
Beach-based organization that represents large doctors' groups, said Facey and 
two other San Fernando Valley-based medical groups were the hardest hit by the 
quake. Combined, the three groups serve more than 170,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem they have now is finding exam rooms and adequate space to see 
patients," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Facey, doctors worked two to an office because the front portion of the 
building was badly damaged by the quake. They worked in shifts, one physician 
seeing patients from 8 a.m. until 2 p.m., and another taking over from then 
until 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At a front desk, sick people crowded a waiting room while nurses frantically 
tried to reschedule appointments. There was no heat, and a large rooftop air 
conditioner sat in what had once been a garden atrium. The machinery had 
toppled from two stories above. 
</P>
<P>
 Facey was forced to close down its Porter Ranch office indefinitely because of 
heavy damage, and other offices in Canyon Country and Valencia were also 
damaged. Because the group's regular medical courier service was not operating, 
Facey employees had to carry needed medications to Santa Clarita Valley 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Dellavedova, executive administrator of Greater Valley Medical Group, 
which has 30 doctors, nine offices and 50,000 patients in the San Fernando and 
Santa Clarita valleys, said the group's buildings and equipment may have 
suffered $1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Its offices in Granada Hills and Mission Hills could be condemned, but its 
other offices were being reopened Monday. The group has no earthquake 
insurance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Displaced group doctors have been offered temporary office space by both Holy 
Cross Hospital and Granada Hills Community Hospital, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Calverley, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Medical Assn., said that 
so many doctors were knocked out of their offices that the association is 
sending faxes to its 1,000 members listing space to lease elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Walter Murrell, a psychologist, got hit with a double whammy. His offices 
in Sherman Oaks and in West Los Angeles were both ruined by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "One's history and the other may be," Murrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 At his West Los Angeles office, in the condemned Barrington Building, all his 
patient records were destroyed. But he hopes to be able to salvage some records 
in his Valley office. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Murrell is already seeing patients again at newly leased offices 
in Santa Monica and the Valley. And he is turning the move into a test of sorts 
for his patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offices were a stable influence in my patients' lives, a place where they 
could go and let their hair down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they are gone. But it's been a good barometer for me of how well they are 
doing. It shows who can adapt to change and who cannot." 
</P>
<P>
 Many pharmacies were shut down for several days last week, while telephones at 
others were still tied up continually Monday, as pharmacists continued to 
reshelve medications. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy P. King, a pharmacist at Patton Pharmacy in Santa Monica, said his 
building was so badly damaged that he moved to another about a mile away, where 
he shares space with St. John's Medical Plaza Pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our roommates are going to get real sick of us. It's stressful but I 
try to remind myself this is an adventure," he said, adding that he is trying 
to secure some trailers to set up a temporary store at his old location. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some people who lost their medications in the quake reported 
difficulty getting replacements that will be covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Solomon, the pharmacist at Clark Drugs in Canoga Park, said about a dozen 
people have come in for replacement drugs lost down the sink or destroyed in 
other ways. But he said many insurance companies will not reimburse for 
replacement medications if the original pills were used up too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a problem," Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Stephens, a spokesman for PCS, a company that processes pharmaceutical 
claims for insurance companies, said the firm instructed employees last Tuesday 
to authorize pharmacists to refill prescriptions early. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Stephens said, not one request to refill a prescription early has been 
denied. It is still up to the individual pharmacist, however, to make the call, 
he said.

STATE BALLOT DRIVE TARGETS LOCAL NO-SMOKING LAWS; INITIATIVE: MEASURE SUPPORTED 
BY PHILIP MORRIS AND SOME RESTAURANT OWNERS WOULD INVALIDATE BANS IN ORANGE 
COUNTY, CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND OTHER PLACES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Philip Morris U.S.A., the nation's largest cigarette manufacturer, and some 
Los Angeles area restaurants plan to sponsor a November ballot initiative that 
would abolish local anti-smoking ordinances in California, The Times learned 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, called the California Uniform Tobacco Control Act, would place 
the responsibility for regulating smoking in the hands of the Legislature, and 
invalidate smoking bans in Los Angeles, Orange County and more than 100 other 
cities and counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry long has sought a statewide smoking standard, ending the 
authority of cities and counties to regulate smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Stitzenberger of the Dolphin Group, a Los Angeles political consulting 
firm, said his firm had been hired to qualify the measure for the ballot and he 
expects to have a $1-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have every indication that Philip Morris will be a player," Stitzenberger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed initiative is similar to legislation supported by the tobacco 
industry and carried last year by Assemblyman Curtis Tucker (D-Inglewood). That 
bill, which stalled in the state Senate, also sought to preempt local 
government from regulating smoking and impose statewide regulations looser than 
those adopted by many localities. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the tobacco measure met Monday in an attempt to come up with a 
strategy for battling it. Chances are slim that they would have time to raise 
the money necessary to place a countermeasure on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's outrageous," Tony Najera of the American Lung Assn. of California said 
after reading the proposed initiative. "I have all the confidence that the 
voters will not be fooled by the desperate tactics of the tobacco industry." 
</P>
<P>
 In documents filed last week with the state attorney general, the proponent of 
the Uniform Tobacco Control Act is listed as Donna Maret-Fahrenholtz, a 
restaurant owner in Playa del Rey. Maret-Fahrenholtz, who could not be reached, 
has been involved in fights against local smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 Stitzenberger said he expects to receive donations from Los Angeles restaurant 
owners opposed to Los Angeles' smoking ban, and from a group of small 
restaurant and bar owners known as the California Business and Restaurant Assn. 
The California Restaurant Assn., the state's largest restaurant association, 
has called for a statewide smoking ban and is likely to oppose the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran consultant involved in the initiative industry said other tobacco 
companies and the industry-funded Tobacco Institute are not involved. "There is 
no other company involved with this" other than Philip Morris, said the 
consultant, who asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Philip Morris U.S.A., the tobacco arm of the food and 
tobacco conglomerate, did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the initiative, the Legislature would need a two-thirds vote to make any 
changes in smoking laws. Tobacco industry lobbyists are influential in 
Sacramento and cigarette manufacturers are heavy contributors to legislative 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 cities and counties in California have banned smoking in 
restaurants and at least 70 have prohibited smoking in all enclosed workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the Orange County Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance that will 
prohibit smoking in restaurants, retail stores and businesses in unincorporated 
areas by 1995. And many of the county's cities, including Anaheim, Santa Ana, 
San Juan Capistrano, Seal Beach, Laguna Hills and Huntington Beach, have passed 
ordinances restricting smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed initiative would permit smoking in 25% of the dining area of 
restaurants so long as they provide ventilation set forth in the initiative. 
The ventilation standards listed in the initiative are not designed to protect 
against the ill effects of second-hand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure also would permit smoking in bars, private offices, ventilated 
conference rooms, 25% of the seating areas in employee cafeterias, designated 
smoking lounges in workplaces, portions of bowling allies, hotel lobbies and 
conference rooms, card clubs and racetracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would permit business and restaurant owners to ban smoking in 
their establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general has 45 days to analyze the initiative, write a summary 
and give the measure a title. Once the measure has a title and summary, the 
proponents can begin gathering signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphin Group will have to rush to get the measure on the ballot because 
the secretary of state suggests that signatures for a measure headed for the 
November ballot be submitted by April 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure needs 385,000 valid signatures of registered voters, and 
Stitzenberger said he is negotiating with the two major California firms that 
gather petition signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd have to be very lucky to make the '94 ballot," Stitzenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the initiative does not qualify this year, he said, his company will 
attempt to place the measure on a 1996 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the politically influential Sacramento law firm of Nielsen & 
Merksamer, which represents Gov. Pete Wilson, wrote the measure. Wilson's 
campaign staff was unaware of the planned initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Stitzenberger said the initiative would clarify the situation in which 
individual cities and counties have created a complicated "patchwork quilt." 
"There is no level playing field" for businesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the measure is on the ballot, Stitzenberger said he believes he will 
obtain campaign money from the organizations that supported Tucker's bill, 
including the California Hotel and Motel Assn., California Manufacturers Assn., 
and perhaps the state Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a brutal assault on local control," said Assemblyman Terry Friedman 
(D-Brentwood), who carried a bill last year to ban smoking in virtually all 
indoor workplaces but was stalled in the Senate. "This would be a huge retreat 
just at a time when the evidence is overwhelming that secondhand smoke kills."

SHE SAW HER FINANCIAL SUCCESS AS A WAY TO BETTER THE COMMUNITY; OBITUARY: PATSY 
BROWN MADE 'SOMETHING GOOD AND MARVELOUS' OUT OF SOUTH-CENTRAL GROCERY STORE 
BEFORE FALLING TO CANCER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 While thousands of successful African Americans see financial success as 
tickets out of black communities, Herbert and Patsy Brown used their affluence 
to more firmly secure their place in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's Metals and Salvage, which once sold up to $40 million of recycled 
copper to Japanese firms, made the couple wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Patsy Brown was about a lot more than making money. Just over nine years 
ago, at Van Ness and Vernon avenues, she and her husband opened Papa's Grocery 
-- a landmark business celebrated for its impeccable appearance and the quality 
of its merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her store meant pride," Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said 
Monday. "From the day it opened, it was kept immaculate. It was a symbol of how 
small business can and should be in our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was committed to the store, friends often said, because she knew the 
community needed it -- and dozens more like it. Despite being robbed once and 
kidnaped another time, she continued to oversee the store from her small office 
in back, keeping from friends and customers the secret only she and her husband 
had shared since February -- she was battling pancreatic cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 She lost her fight with the disease Sunday. She was 64. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her vision was to bring quality foods such as you'd find at Gelson's to the 
community," said state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), who was once Brown's 
neighbor in the View Park area of Southwest Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At Papa's Grocery, the shelves feature name brands alongside lesser-known 
African American and Caribbean foods produced locally by small manufacturers or 
imported from Jamaica and Belize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this store; it's beautiful," said Veronica Willis, a customer who 
lives nearby. "At first I was surprised it was here. When I had no groceries at 
home, Mrs. Brown would let me shop until I could pay. She was a beautiful 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleopatra Fleming, another customer, said Brown's death left her in shock. 
"You know you're getting fresh food here," Fleming said. "You know there is 
high quality and courteous people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To make her market work, Brown had to absorb hundreds of thousands of dollars 
in losses -- nearly $200,000 the first year, $100,000 the next -- before the 
grocery became a neighborhood institution. 
</P>
<P>
 "She refused to give up or give in," said Ridley-Thomas, adding that she had 
"a sense of not mere optimism, but full-blown hopefulness about things to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
 "She put everything back into the market," Herbert Brown said. "She wanted to 
start a chain. We managed to reach break-even a few times." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mind was a swirling caldron of ideas. But, unlike many other dreamers, she 
had the resources and will to act on some of hers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to reach halfway," she said in a 1988 interview. "I love to make 
something good and marvelous out of something ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was flamboyant at times, perhaps a vestige of her days as a fledgling 
actress before she became a contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was always on," Watson said. "I remember when she moved to her new house. 
It had a theater. She said: 'I will be on stage even if I'm my own audience.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although the family businesses made her financially comfortable, Brown was at 
the store every day -- relishing the most minute details of dealing with 
customers and suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 In South-Central, where some residents have to take at least two buses to 
reach the nearest full-service grocery store, Papa's Grocery became something 
of a mini job-training program for neighborhood youths. Just being able to earn 
their own money gives box boys a chance to change their lives, Brown told 
visitors to her store. Neighborhood youngsters besieged her, wanting to know if 
they could get a job once they turned 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Her store was spared when rioting left other businesses near hers in 
smoldering ruins in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 She said later that customers "have supported me not because I'm black, but 
because I give good service to them. A lot of these other stores can't make 
that claim." 
</P>
<P>
 Her training technique for new employees was simple and direct, she once said: 
"The first time you're rude, you're out the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the market's first years, when the balance sheet was gushing red ink, 
other business ideas swirled through Brown's imagination. Her family negotiated 
for nearly a year to redevelop the closed basement store at the May Co.'s 
Baldwin Hills store. Their plan was to put in a theater, specialty shops and a 
restaurant around a common area that could be used for private functions. But 
that deal never materialized after the parties were unable to agree on 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year, walls in her small office at the rear of her store were 
covered with architectural plans and artist's renditions of "The Dons," a 
47-unit luxury condo development she planned for the Baldwin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family's construction company was moving along briskly with building the 
development's first phase when Southern California's free-falling real estate 
market forced her husband to shut down work on it in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown family fortunes were also struck a powerful blow when their scrap 
metal firm lost a contract to buy copper from a U.S. supplier for reprocessing 
and sale to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But no blow was more painful than the robbery of her store last year. The 
robbers knew exactly what day and time to strike, she said at the time, 
convinced that one of her many former employees had helped to set her up. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown became something of a celebrity to national media looking for stories on 
black business. She appeared on network television and in national 
publications, and she believed that that exposure led to her being kidnaped in 
October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman pretending to be a writer for a national magazine arranged to meet 
Brown at a Culver City hotel for an interview. When Brown arrived, she was 
abducted in the parking lot. Later, her son Dennis drove to a restaurant where 
he had been directed to leave the ransom. He happened to see a woman making a 
phone call, and realized that she was calling the market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Brown followed the woman in his car, keeping police aware of the 
kidnapers' location. Police arrived, arrested the woman and her accomplices and 
rescued Brown, her son said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles native who met her husband in third grade, Brown graduated from 
Polytechnic High School, now Los Angeles Trade Tech College. Her parents were 
dancers who appeared on the local nightclub circuit and in early black-produced 
films. Her mother danced in the chorus at Los Angeles' legendary Club Alabam, a 
Central Avenue landmark in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her husband and her son Dennis, she is survived by another son, 
Patrick, eight grandchildren and her grandmother, Lillian Harris. A private 
funeral service was held Monday, and a memorial service is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was dedicated to the community," Watson said. "Her business really took 
our community to a higher level."

 Genetic defects -- A Jan. 16 Times article on human experimentation stated 
that Turner syndrome, a genetic defect that afflicts some girls, causes mental 
retardation. Though experts previously believed this to be the case, recent 
research suggests otherwise. While some Turner patients exhibit problems with 
math, sense of direction and manual dexterity, these are now considered 
specific learning disabilities, not signs of retardation.

 Renters' rights -- Renters whose buildings were destroyed in the recent 
earthquake can get refunds for part of their January rent payments depending on 
their lease agreements, said Ted Kimball, president of the California Apartment 
Assn.The lease should state that a renter is due a refund if the building is 
uninhabitable "through no fault of either party." If it doesn't, a landlord may 
deny a refund claim. The Personal Finance column in Sunday's editions 
incorrectly implied that all renters could get refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the toll-free number for the apartment association's rental hot line is 
not available in the San Fernando Valley. Valley residents seeking apartment 
information can call (818) 374-3240.

STORM BRINGS MORE WOES FOR TENT REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC and LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Heavy rain hammered down on 2,500 weary earthquake refugees huddled in Army 
tents as an intense winter storm moved in from the Pacific on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The biting storm, coupled with continuing aftershocks, increased the burden on 
families driven from their homes and forced to seek shelter in the four 
makeshift encampments in San Fernando Valley parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, there's no other place for them to go," said Salvation Army 
Maj. Darvin Carpenter. "I wish I could tell you it won't be messy, but it 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 The forecast was not good. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally heavy showers were expected through the night, with up to an inch of 
rain predicted in the campsite areas by dawn today. The National Weather 
Service warned that flash-flooding could occur below some of the hillsides 
stripped of vegetation during last fall's devastating fires. 
</P>
<P>
 No flooding was expected in the refugee camps, but showers, puddling and mud 
were beginning to make an already difficult existence even drearier. The 165 
tents have no floors, and many of the people in them -- spurning cots offered 
by relief officials -- were bedded down on the ground, with only a thin sheet 
of plastic or cardboard to protect them from the increasingly soggy earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people don't want anything but the ground," Carpenter said. "It's going 
to be difficult if it rains long and hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Still fearing the possibility of another large tremor, many of those braving 
the cold, wet weather Monday night had chosen to remain outdoors, even though 
their homes had been declared safe for occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 As the rain continued to pour down in the darkness, most of the refugees 
stayed inside the tents, which National Guardsmen said should provide adequate 
protection from the rain above, if not from seepage from below. 
</P>
<P>
 "These tents are built for war, so they can handle a little L.A. rain," said 
Guard Lt. Kasten Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 By 10 p.m., the only sounds at the little encampment at West Valley Park in 
Reseda were the drumming of the rain and the soft crying of a few children. The 
only light to be seen was the occasional glow of a flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
 There were at least five aftershocks of 3.0 or greater magnitude Monday, 
strong enough to be felt and to prolong concerns about further damage. The 
strongest was a 3.3 temblor at 10:16 a.m., centered in the same general area as 
the 6.6 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,500 aftershocks had been recorded by noon Monday, according to 
officials from Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey. The two largest were 
between magnitude 5.0 and 5.6, one last Monday and one Wednesday. Thirty-five 
registered between 4.0 and 4.9 on the seismographs at Caltech. Two hundred 
seventy-two registered between 3.0 and 3.9. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aftershocks are following a very normal pattern for Californian 
earthquakes and are decaying (decreasing in intensity and frequency) as 
expected," according to a Caltech statement. "Compared to average sequence, the 
Northridge aftershocks are a bit more energetic than average but are also 
decaying a bit more quickly than average." 
</P>
<P>
 The probability of magnitude 5 aftershocks in the next week is about one in 
five, the statement added. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures released by the state Office of Emergency Services on Monday set the 
confirmed death toll from the quake at 57, two more than the total provided 
Monday. Whether the increase came from new fatalities or from a recompilation 
of earlier figures was not made clear. The state said 56 died in Los Angeles 
County and one died in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said that 1,241 people were hospitalized with quake-related 
injuries in Los Angeles County and another 7,192 were treated for injuries and 
released. In Ventura County, 725 people were treated for injuries from the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 David Langness, a spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California, 
said that as the aftershocks continue, people with symptoms of stress, anxiety 
and shock keep showing up at hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many patients are coming into emergency rooms with 'aftershock shock,' " 
Langness said. "Hospitals keep treating a mounting stream of post-traumatic 
stress disorder patients." 
</P>
<P>
 Stress problems were reported in some of the emergency encampments for 
earthquake refugees. The Salvation Army said a woman who fainted at Lanark Park 
in Canoga Park explained later that she had lost two brothers in an earthquake 
in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton urged those providing help "to keep your 
chins up and keep working," and he said he would do what he could to speed up 
action on his request for what is expected to be more than $5 billion in 
federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am pleased with the work you've done," the President told Cabinet members 
and other federal officials in Los Angeles during a phone call Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton plans to announce today that he will waive a federal law requiring 
state and local governments to pick up 25% of the cost of repairing damage from 
natural disasters to public facilities such as schools, roads and water mains. 
Under the waiver, the federal government would pick up 90% of those costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has asked the federal government to pick up 100% of the 
costs, but that would require a special act of Congress, and the Administration 
is unlikely to support the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson declared a state of emergency in Orange County on Monday, making 
residents and local governments eligible for state assistance and a possible 
federal disaster declaration. Aside from minor damage in Anaheim, Cypress, 
Fountain Valley, Fullerton and La Palma, the only structure to suffer severe 
damage was Anaheim Stadium, where the 17-ton scoreboard collapsed. City 
officials have estimated damage to the stadium at $3 million to $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 White House budget officials plan to brief members of the California 
congressional delegation this morning on the earthquake-relief package, 
allowing Clinton to announce his plans during his nationally televised State of 
the Union speech tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact dollar amount of the aid package remains in doubt as damage 
estimates continue to change. Administration officials expect that the numbers 
probably will continue to mount as Congress works on the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking toward the pending fight in Washington for the aid package, 
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said the Administration will try to 
bring heads of congressional appropriation committees to Los Angeles to assess 
the needs firsthand. Already, Pena said, there is some reticence in the 
Congress that must be confronted. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena, who has been here since a few hours after the original quake, noted that 
the federal government is still facing requests for aid from eight Midwestern 
states affected by last year's severe flooding of the Mississippi River and its 
tributaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know that with the Midwest floods, (passage of $4 billion of quake aid to 
Los Angeles) is not going to be a given," Pena said. "It's really hard, if 
you're not here, to understand what's happened here. If you're from another 
state and you're in Washington, and you haven't been here (to see) the damage, 
it's just, 'The- big- state- of- California- and- why- do- they- really- need- 
the- federal- government's- help' kind of attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation secretary said California's fight for federal funding could 
be enhanced by quick imposition of a statewide tax to help pay for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "What impresses me, as someone (based in Washington), is to see local effort," 
Pena said. "When people say, 'We're willing to pay our fair share, but we need 
your help; we want you to be our partner,' I think there is a more receptive 
ear. . . . I think that would be a positive message to the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 For the city of Los Angeles, building inspections continued to be one of the 
biggest tasks. City Building and Safety officials said that by Monday morning, 
they had inspected about 10,000 structures. Of those, 4,322 had been declared 
at least partially unsafe for occupancy. The unsafe structures include 14,576 
dwelling units, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that by Monday afternoon, 63,927 applications for assistance 
had been received by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and state and 
local agencies and housing vouchers had been issued to 2,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
 That compares with the 9,798 applications received in the first seven days 
after the 1992 Loma Prieta quake in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications were being accepted at 15 centers across the city, with a 16th 
center scheduled to open today. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Department officials said Monday they will begin scaling 
back their department-wide mobilization over the next day or so, focusing 
attention on the worst-hit areas while allowing some officers to return to 
normal schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Some National Guard troops also will begin moving out of the city, emergency 
coordinators said, though many will be replaced by other troops until life here 
begins to return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that by Monday morning, electrical power had been restored for 
all but a handful of residents, and those residents can have their power turned 
on if they call the Department of Water and Power to report the problem, said 
Dan Waters, the DWP's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the city's residents have running water again. All of it is safe 
for drinking except in the Santa Monica Mountains, Pacific Palisades and in the 
West San Fernando Valley, where residents are advised to continue boiling 
drinking water. It could be several more days before officials can vouch for 
the water quality in those areas, Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Gas. Co. said gas was flowing safely again for about 
80,000 customers whose service was interrupted because of the quake, but 
thousands more were yet to have their service restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Working to restore service were about 3,400 gas company employees, along with 
crews from San Diego Gas and Electric, the Long Beach Gas Department and 
Southwest Gas, which serves part of San Bernardino County.

NATIONAL AGENDA; IN BELFAST STREETS, THE MOOD IS GLUM; CATHOLICS AND

TALKS.

 In the cold, gray winter drizzle that makes West Belfast gloomier than usual, 
the whitewashed slogans on the dark stone walls along the Falls Road stand out: 
"Support the Peace Process" and "Back the Peace Initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 The upbeat messages in this heavily Roman Catholic, republican area refer to 
the Dec. 15 Downing Street Declaration signed by British Prime Minister John 
Major and Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds in hopes of finding a way to end 
25 years of sectarian violence in troubled Northern Ireland, also known as 
Ulster. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was hailed by many as breaking new ground in the search for a 
negotiated solution to the longstanding struggle between Catholics and 
Protestants in Northern Ireland -- a struggle that has claimed 3,100 lives 
since 1969. It was hoped particularly that this might be the key to luring Sinn 
Fein to the bargaining table. Sinn Fein is the political arm of the Irish 
Republican Army, which employs violence in its drive to see Ulster politically 
unified with the Republic of Ireland to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the fortresslike bars in The Falls, the mood is not optimistic. For 
despite their expressed desire for a peaceful existence, people here sense 
deeply the chasm that separates Protestant Unionists from Catholic republicans 
in this violence-prone, British-ruled corner of the world.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how it's going to work," said an unemployed lather in a working 
men's club. "The 'Prods' won't give us anything. It's all religious. That's the 
way it is. They like killing Catholics." Referring to a famous road in a 
predominantly Protestant section of town, he added: "If I went to the Shankill 
for a pint, I could be shot dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The painted slogans supporting the peace initiative -- originally pushed by 
Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, and John Hume, moderate Catholic leader of 
the Social Democratic and Labor Party -- are sometimes draped in the orange, 
white and green flag of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 But around the corner on Springfield Road, the red, white and blue Union Jack 
flies over a British army barracks, encased with steel netting to ward off 
grenade and mortar attacks.  
</P>
<P>
 And less than half a mile away is Shankill Road, the Protestant Unionist area 
separated from its Falls neighbor by a metal fence as daunting as the Berlin 
Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 There, a few doors away from a building blown up by the IRA in an October 
attack aimed at Protestant extremists, is another pub, Spartan and protected by 
a security barrier. Its patrons are equally glum about peace prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outsiders don't seem to realize that we Protestants aren't Irish," said one 
solidly built customer. "We're British and we want to remain British, not 
Irish. We've been here for 400 years. We're going to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the British have given too much away to the IRA," added another. "The 
IRA wants to stomp on the majority in Northern Ireland. The British talking to 
the IRA makes it look as if violence pays off. They ought to take the kid 
gloves off and deal with the IRA as terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
 What was considered historic and hopeful about the December accord was that 
for the first time, London and Dublin cooperated closely in offering the IRA a 
place at a peace table. It followed secret contacts between the British and at 
least some elements of the IRA.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 London and Dublin apparently calculated theirs as a "win-win" offer: An IRA 
rejection could marginalize the organization both at home and in the larger 
world community.  
</P>
<P>
 As part of the December agreement, the British also declared themselves 
willing to leave the fate of Northern Ireland to its inhabitants in a freely 
determined choice. The mostly Catholic Irish agreed to amend their republic's 
constitution to satisfy Ulster Protestants in the event of unification. Talks 
were due to begin as soon as all parties agreed, but Sinn Fein has delayed a 
firm response. 
</P>
<P>
 The party's Gerry Adams insists that before he agrees to sit down at any 
bargaining table, the Downing Street Declaration needs "clarification." Major 
says the declaration is already clear and that further conversation is 
tantamount to negotiation, which is not supposed to take place under the 
December agreement until after a three-month cease-fire. Hume,meanwhile, says 
Major should not object to offering a clarification to Adams if that would get 
the peace process moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it sounds like abstruse theological arguments in early 
Christendom," said one observer. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the language in the December declaration is purposely 
ambiguous. It is an attempt to square the Ulster circle by offering republican 
militants enough to bring them to the table without outraging their equally 
militant Unionist counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 The critical sentence in the document reads: "The British government agrees 
that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between 
the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on 
the basis of consent, freely and currently given, North and South." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This, the British claim, fully protects the Protestant Unionists' majority 
rights in Northern Ireland because any change could only come about with their 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is the case," commented one veteran observer here, "there doesn't 
then seem to be much in it for the IRA -- which has been fighting for years for 
a united Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
 And Adams' lately stated position is: "Democracy demands that Britain 
recognizes the right of the Irish people to determine our own future in our own 
interests and on our own terms." He refers to an islandwide vote in which 
Ulster Protestants would have a minority voice; Northern Ireland would cease to 
exist as a separate political entity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cramped, two-story party offices in West Belfast, Sinn Fein's national 
chairperson, Tom Hartley, 49, defended Adams' insistence on clarification. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to see if there's the dynamic to move forward," the Belfast city 
councilor said. "If Britain gives the Unionists a veto, then they won't move 
because they don't have to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the British should get ready for a negotiating process leading to 
a united Ireland." While that might well lead to a period of conflict, Hartley 
said, the British ultimately have the economic and military resources to force 
the Protestants to go along, 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley added: "Why shouldn't John Major and Gerry Adams talk? I have a sense 
that age-old conflicts can be moved with negotiations, so I am a bit 
optimistic. We are in a new situation, a period of change." 
</P>
<P>
 But many observers wonder whether the bearded Adams can bring along the 
so-called "hard men" in the IRA if they are being asked to give up violence -- 
which they see as their key bargaining chip -- in exchange for anything less 
than an immediately united Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 A London analyst with connections in Ulster says that attempting to discern 
IRA thinking is like deciphering the Kremlin at the height of the Cold War. 
However, he ventures: "Suppose only 45 'hard men' in the IRA don't go along. 
They could cause a lot of damage and could effectively ruin any effort to bring 
in Sinn Fein because (the party) would be blamed for not stopping violence." 
</P>
<P>
 And another official laments: "Sinn Fein met with IRA 'hard men' from prison 
during the Christmas holiday amnesty. The problem is that when any of the 'hard 
men' objects to negotiation and compromise, everyone else gets queasy about 
disputing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The black joke is that in Britain, if you show courage by standing up to be 
counted, you get the OBE, Order of the British Empire; but among the 
paramilitaries, in standing up, you also get an OBE, One Behind the Ear." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the Protestant Unionists also fret over the London peace 
declaration. They see it as the first step in a British sellout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Ian Paisley, militant leader of the extremist Democratic Unionist 
Party, has launched a series of appearances around the province warning against 
any talks with Sinn Fein, an organization he says "has put (itself) out 
forever. In no set of circumstances will I sit down with men whose hands are 
stained with blood." 
</P>
<P>
 The cautious James Molyneaux heads the moderate Ulster Unionist Party, with 
nine seats in the British House of Commons to Paisley's three, but he too is 
leery of talks that could lead to Ulster being subsumed by the Republic of 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Molyneaux's up-and-coming deputy, Parliament member David Trimble, says the 
Major government has already gone too far cosseting Sinn Fein. "It has put 
itself in the rather embarrassing position where it has been acting like a 
supplicant begging this squalid little terrorist group to be nice to it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government should make it clear that the only thing to do now is to 
continue the political process and to address the Sinn Fein-IRA as a security 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Ulster Unionists wish to remain part of Britain, not the least because 
Northern Ireland is on the receiving end of a $3.5-billion annual subsidy from 
London. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is difficult to envisage Major, beset by his many political woes, 
agreeing to a deal that would cast Ulster adrift -- however popular that might 
prove to the large number of Britons who would like to wash their hands of the 
whole mess. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Britain should ever decide to remove the troops it has stationed in 
Northern Ireland since 1969 -- now 20,000 -- and let the republicans and 
Unionists sort things out among themselves, most military experts believe that 
the Protestants are in a far stronger position. In Northern Ireland, they 
outnumber the Catholics by about 950,000 to 600,000 although the demographics 
are moving in favor of the Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 But the conventional wisdom in Irish-oriented bars in New York, Boston and 
Chicago -- that the Northern Ireland Catholics together with forces from the 
republic would roll up the Protestants -- overlooks some plain military facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Protestants have a long martial history," points out a British military 
historian. "They lost a full division at the Somme in World War I, and they 
have contributed soldiers and many generals to the British army. They are 
better trained and disciplined than their potential Irish opponents." 
</P>
<P>
 And an Ulster man, wounded in Belfast as a serviceman in the British army, 
claims: "We have thousands and thousands of men who have served in the army, 
the Ulster Defense Regiment, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Territorial 
Army (National Guard). They are trained in the use of heavy weapons, artillery, 
mortars, and most of them own light weapons. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The IRA are amateur guerrillas. They can set off their bombs and assassinate 
individuals, but they couldn't fight a proper war, even with the help of the 
Irish army. I would have no qualms about killing an IRA man. And there are many 
more here like me." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Britain, the Dublin government has outlawed the IRA, but it fears that 
any major conflict in Northern Ireland could spread quickly, putting great 
pressure on it to send troops to aid beleaguered Catholics. Most believe a 
civil war will be avoided, mainly because that would create a nightmare for the 
British. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Belfast, with freshly painted facades and new buildings, presents a 
much improved appearance from the worst days of what is euphemistically known 
here as "the troubles." 
</P>
<P>
 Butsome complain that behind the facade, business owners must pay off both 
republican and Unionist paramilitaries. As one taxi driver put it: "Belfast is 
like Chicago in the old days. Every business has to pay protection, and the 
funny thing is you can write it off your income tax" as consultancy fees, 
commissions or some other ruse. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite skepticism over the peace process in many quarters, particularly the 
hard-scrabble areas of The Falls and The Shankill, officials and commentators 
hold out more than a ray of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of years ago, you could not see the Sinn Fein even talking to the 
British government," said one official in Belfast. "That's a first. The idea is 
to bring in the Irish government in a limited way to show that Catholic rights 
are protected. The British seem prepared to accept that." 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows or even predicts what the talks might lead to, with or without 
Sinn Fein. But the hope of people like Hume is that self-rule would be returned 
to Northern Ireland with the Catholics given a "weighted" minority so they 
would have representation in an Ulster assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 (From 1921 to 1972, Northern Ireland had its own regional government based at 
Stormont Castle just northeast of Belfast. That government was suspended in 
1972 and replaced by direct rule from London.)

 In Hume's view, once Protestant Unionists get used to the idea of having 
political input by Ireland's government, an accommodation can slowly proceed, 
with closer ties developed over the years and leading eventually to a united 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, an end to the violence in Ulster will depend on compromise. And as 
one longtime observer here puts it: "Despite all the suffering, the pain level 
has never been sufficiently high to make compromise possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, said one neutral official following the process: "This is a hope, only 
a hope. But it is probably the best hope we have had in a long time." THE 
PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister John Major 
</P>
<P>
 BRITAIN: Would like to unload responsibilities in Northern Ireland, where it 
spends billions and stations 20,000 troops. But if the troops withdraw, it 
fears civil war and being accused of abandoning the 1 million Protestants who 
consider themselves Britons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Albert Reynolds 
</P>
<P>
 IRELAND: Would like a united island of Ireland but is not willing to go to war 
for it. It seeks to assure skeptical Protestants that their traditions would be 
respected despite its Roman Catholic-influenced laws such as bans on divorce 
and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rev. Ian Paisley 
</P>
<P>
 PROTESTANT UNIONISTS: Basically, they want to remain a part of Britain. 
Barring that, they are prepared to set up their own state rather than be 
subsumed by Ireland. Paisley is one of their spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams 
</P>
<P>
 SINN FEIN/IRA: Totally dedicated to a united Ireland. They believe the 
Protestant majority in Ulster must accede to becoming a protected minority on 
the reunited island. 
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 SDLP leader John Hume 
</P>
<P>
 MODERATE CATHOLIC REPUBLICANS: Mainly, the Social Democratic and Labor Party, 
which wants to see Ireland united through a gradual, peaceful process. They are 
outflanked by extremists on both sides. THE 'TROUBLES' IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</P>
<P>
 The wounds that Britain and Ireland are trying to heal are ancient. Some key 
events: * 
</P>
<P>
 1608 -- Scottish and English Protestants colonize areas of Ulster, 
confiscating land from the mostly Roman Catholic Irish. Many trace the present 
Northern Irish conflict to this event. * 
</P>
<P>
 1690 -- Battle of the Boyne. At Dublin, Protestant William III defeats an 
attempt by Catholic King James II to win back the English throne. Penal Laws 
are passed to keep Irish Catholics powerless. * 
</P>
<P>
 1782 -- Britain recognizes an independent Irish Parliament. But Catholics may 
not hold office. * 
</P>
<P>
 1798 -- The Irish Rebellion. Unsuccessful. Led by an Irish Protestant, it is 
nonetheless supported by Catholic France, reviving anti-Catholic sentiment. * 
</P>
<P>
 1800 -- Britain abolishes the Irish Parliament and unites Ireland and Britain 
in a United Kingdom with one Parliament. * 
</P>
<P>
 1905 -- Sinn Fein (We Ourselves) is organized among Irish Catholics to fight 
for independence. * 
</P>
<P>
 1916 -- The Easter Rebellion against British rule breaks out in Dublin. It is 
repressed by British forces, and its leaders are executed. * 
</P>
<P>
 1919 -- Irish members of the British Parliament establish their own Parliament 
in Dublin and declare Ireland's independence. Civil war breaks out, and the 
Irish Republican Army (IRA) is formed. * 
</P>
<P>
 1922 -- An Irish Free State, mostly populated by Roman Catholics, is 
established within the British Empire. Meanwhile, the six northern counties, 
mostly Protestant, remain part of Britain proper. * 
</P>
<P>
 1949 -- Ireland becomes the Republic of Ireland, leaving the British 
Commonwealth. * 
</P>
<P>
 March, 1972 -- Britain disbands the Protestant-dominated Parliament of 
Northern Ireland, instituting direct rule by Britain. * 
</P>
<P>
 July, 1972 -- Bloody Friday. Eleven people are killed by 26 IRA bombs in 
Belfast. * 
</P>
<P>
 1980s -- Bobby Sands, a British Parliament member, is among 10 IRA inmates at 
Maze prison who die during a hunger strike protesting conditions and demanding 
political-prisoner status. IRA launches bomb attacks, including one in 1984 
that barely misses Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. * 
</P>
<P>
 1985 -- Anglo-Irish Agreement gives Ireland a say in Northern Ireland affairs 
in return for cooperation in combatting terrorism. * 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 15, 1993 -- Britain and Ireland invite Sinn Fein to join negotiations for 
a united Ireland, on condition that violence stops in Northern Ireland. But 
violence continues, and no agreement is reached.
