PHARM REPORT / KATHLEEN DOHENY: PERSONAL HEALTH; DOES HAIR TREATMENT AFFECT THE 
UNBORN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every day, obstetricians warn their patients not to use recreational drugs and 
to ask before taking any new medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the grayer area of hair treatments? To color or not? To curl, 
to straighten, to highlight? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tough call. Studies on the chemicals found in some hair care products 
-- and their effects on the unborn -- are just beginning. A Pittsburgh doctor 
has recently embarked on such a study. 
</P>
<P>
 Until more data is in, many obstetricians advise abstinence or moderation, 
especially during early pregnancy. There are also some common-sense measures to 
minimize chemical exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's What: Hair care preparations include a variety of chemicals, according 
to John Corbett, a vice president and chemist at Clairol Inc. The active 
ingredient in permanent waves is ammonium thioglycolate, he says, while hair 
relaxers often contain sodium hydroxide. Hair color may contain aromatic amines 
and phenols. Bleaching typically involves the use of hydrogen peroxide. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Government Regulation: Hair treatment products are regulated by the Food and 
Drug Administration, says John Bailey, acting director of the FDA Office of 
Colors and Cosmetics. "Basically, manufacturers have to vouch for the safety of 
the product," he says. Testing for toxicity during pregnancy, however, is "not 
a specified requirement," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Industry Input: There is no scientific evidence to indicate any ill effect 
during pregnancy from hair color, permanents or relaxers, says Irene Malbin, a 
spokeswoman for the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Assn., a Washington, 
D.C.-based trade organization. More than a dozen animal studies investigating 
the effect of hair color, for instance, have found no adverse effects, she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemicals from hair products are absorbed through the scalp "in minute 
quantities," says Corbett. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the association advises pregnant women to consult their doctors for 
guidance "on any aspect of lifestyle during pregnancy," Malbin adds.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to Industry Input: Some animal studies have found adverse effects 
from hair product ingredients, counters Dr. Karen Ann Filkins, director of 
reproductive genetics at West Penn Hospital, Pittsburgh, and a University of 
Pittsburgh associate professor of genetics, who has begun a study of hair 
treatments during pregnancy. But the quantities studied are much higher doses 
than those typically used by consumers, leading her to speculate that there 
would normally be no birth defect problems with use of the products. 
</P>
<P>
 She'll know more after her study results are in. (There is no completion date 
yet.) So far, Filkins has collected data on about 100 women who have become 
pregnant after exposure to chemicals in hair treatments and hopes to study 
thousands.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors' Advice: This lack of human data -- and the absence of an official 
stand on the issue by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 
-- leaves many doctors erring on the side of caution. Avoid the use of 
permanents, hair colors and relaxers during pregnancy and especially during the 
first trimester, Filkins advises. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can wait, wait," agrees Dr. Sandi Leong, a Santa Monica obstetrician 
on staff at Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But Filkins and Leong also advise women not to panic if they use hair 
treatments and then learn they are pregnant.  
</P>
<P>
 Moderation is next best to abstinence, Filkins says. Women can pick treatments 
that involve minimal contact of chemicals with the scalp, such as highlighting, 
thus avoiding absorption. 
</P>
<P>
 Pregnant hairdressers should take the same precautions as lab workers, Filkins 
says, wearing gloves when handling chemicals, avoiding contact with skin and 
working in a well-ventilated area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hairdresser Input: "First ask your obstetrician," advises Francois Noel, a 
colorist at Cristophe Salon in Beverly Hills. "I usually suggest avoiding hair 
color during the first trimester," he adds, but thinks the caution is probably 
overkill.  
</P>
<P>
 "Perm just the ends of the hair," suggests Ben Ashikita, owner of Soshin, a 
Santa Monica hair salon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other Safeguards: "Pick the chair in the best ventilated area," Filkins 
advises pregnant women undergoing hair treatments.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hot-line Help: The California Teratogen Information Service, a state-funded 
service, operates from 9 a.m.-4:30 p.m. weekdays and can answer questions about 
hair product exposure. Call (800)-532-3749 or (619) 294-6084.

BOOK REVIEW / ASIAN AMERICAN LITERATURE; IT'S A LARGE WORLD, AFTER ALL -- ONE 
BOTH FOREIGN AND FAMILIAR; GROWING UP ASIAN-AMERICAN: AN ANTHOLOGY, EDITED BY 
MARIA HONG (WILLIAM MORROW, $22, 416 PAGES); CHARLIE CHAN IS DEAD: AN ANTHOLOGY 
OF CONTEMPORARY ASIAN-AMERICAN FICTION, EDITED BY JESSICA HAGEDORN (PENGUIN, 
$14, 569 PAGES)

<P>
 It is all too easy to lump minority writers together. For Asian American 
writers, it's been no different. Gish Jen jokingly refers to the "Gang of Four" 
approach: She is often compared to Gus Lee, David Wong Louie and Amy Tan. 
</P>
<P>
 What then is the purpose of not one, but two anthologies of Asian American 
writing? Plenty. Above all, to show the individuality of the Asian American 
experience and the breadth of human stories these writers have to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Jen, represented in both anthologies, has a story in "Growing Up 
Asian-American" that is the perfect example of how grouping all Asian Americans 
together can be a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 In "What Means Switch," Jen introduces us to Mona Chang, a Chinese American 
girl who, as the new kid at a Scarsdale junior high school, uses her Asian 
heritage to impress her classmates. She tells her new friends that she knows 
karate, offering to chop a girl's arm. (The girl declines.) Mona shows off the 
little Chinese she knows, "Be-yeh, fa-foon. Shee-veh. Ji nu," meaning, "Stop 
acting crazy. Rice gruel. Soy sauce." As she explains: "Pretty soon I'm getting 
popular for a new girl." 
</P>
<P>
 That is, until she tries out her Chinese on what she thinks is a new Chinese 
student -- Sherman Matsumoto. She learns that he is Japanese, of another 
country and another world. But at Scarsdale junior high, as the only two Asian 
kids, their differences become meaningless in a sea of white faces. 
</P>
<P>
 The anthologies include excerpts from beloved contemporary novels, such as Amy 
Tan's "The Joy Luck Club" and David Mura's "Turning Japanese: Memoirs of a 
Sansei," but there are also lesser-known works. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Hong brings us a rare gem in "Pat and Pint," a story by Edith Eaton, a 
turn-of-the century Chinese American writer who wrote under the pseudonym Sui 
Sin Far ("Water Lily" in Cantonese). 
</P>
<P>
 As Hong writes in her introduction, "During the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries, Americans of Asian descent faced prejudice from individuals as well 
as widely institutionalized, systematic forms of racism. The Chinese Exclusion 
Acts of 1880 and 1882 severely restricted immigration from China compared with 
immigration from European nations. Similarly, the California Alien Land Act of 
1913 prohibited Asian-American farm owners from owning land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given this context, Edith Eaton's embracing of her Chinese heritage, as 
expressed in her writings, suggests a uniquely courageous and formidable 
spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was in the 1920s, Jessica Hagedorn reminds us, that Asian Americans 
were saddled with their most persistent stereotype: Charlie Chan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie Chan is our most famous fake 'Asian' pop icon," she writes, "known 
for his obsequious manner, fractured English and dainty walk. Absurdly cryptic, 
pseudo-Confucian sayings rolled off his tongue: 
</P>
<P>
 "Observe." 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy Scout knife, like ladies' hairpin. Have many uses." 
</P>
<P>
 "Best place for skeleton is in family closet." 
</P>
<P>
 "Chinese people interested in all things psychic." 
</P>
<P>
 The Charlie Chan character was created in 1925 by a white man named Earl Derr 
Biggers. His Chinese fantasy, Hagedorn points out, "is as much a part of the 
demeaning legacy of stereotypes that includes Fu Manchu, Stepin Fetchit, Sambo, 
Aunt Jemima, Amos N' Andy, Speedy Gonzales, Tonto and Little Brown Brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Such images became cultural bogymen for Hagedorn as she was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in the Philippines," she writes, "watching Hollywood movies 
featuring yellow-face, blackface and redface actors giving me their versions of 
myself. It was so easy to succumb to the seductive, insidious power of these 
skewed, wide-screen images. Better than books, movies were immediate and 
reached more people -- both literate and illiterate. Movies were instantly 
gratifying. Bigger than life. I was a child. The movies were God. And 
therefore, true." 
</P>
<P>
 Questions of race and culture are especially hard for children to discern. 
Take, for example, "They Like You Because You Eat Dog, So What Are You Going to 
Do About It?" -- eight vignettes by 24-year-old Filipino writer R. Zamora 
Linmark that appear in "Charlie Chan Is Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 While Gish Jen's character exploits her classmates' ignorance, for the kids in 
Linmark's story, it isn't so easy: "A lot of my classmates think that Florante 
and I are stupid because we speak English with accents heavier than Mai-Lan 
Phan's. 'You talk like you're always boiling something in your mouth,' Robert 
Johnson always says." 
</P>
<P>
 Also asserting their Asian heritage in these anthologies are two Indian 
writers. Award-winning author Bharati Mukherjee contributes an excerpt from her 
novel "Darkness" to "Charlie Chan Is Dead." Indira Ganesa is represented in 
"Growing Up Asian-American" by an excerpt from her novel, "The Journey." Both 
pieces enhance and expand the definition of being Asian and Asian American. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too easy to forget that Asia is a continent, not a neighborhood or any 
one group of people that we can fully know or understand by reading a book or 
two or even three. The beauty of these anthologies is that no one writer or 
tale purports to tell the Asian American experience. The pleasure in owning 
these books is in being able to come to them again and again, each time 
entering a world that is, at once, foreign and familiar.

NEW YEAR'S WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; 'MRS. DOUBTFIRE' TAKES THE HOLIDAY

 The winner and still champ of the holidays is 20th Century Fox's "Mrs. 
Doubtfire." Since its opening the day before Thanksgiving, the Robin 
Williams-in-drag comedy has grossed $122.6 million, making it far and away the 
biggest attraction of the season."That lady's got legs," crowed Fox Executive 
Vice President Tom Sherak. The New Year's weekend was a big one for the film 
industry, giving it the equivalent of a last-second touchdown for 1993 
following a few weeks where business was running behind the pace of last year's 
Christmas season. 04,33,18,10,10 Weekend Gross/ Screens/ Weeks in Movie

TV REVIEW; 'ARMED' WITH A MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although devoid of style and burdened with undistinguished performances, the 
anti-gun drama "Armed and Innocent" (at 9 tonight on CBS, Channels 2 and 8) 
still packs a stinging theme: the psychological price of keeping guns in the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Starring Gerald McRaney and Kate Jackson as a complacent, conventional 
middle-class couple raising two kids in a pretty house in the country, the 
production is salvaged by its fresh look at the tragic effects of stashing 
weapons in the closet and the bureau drawer.In Danielle Hill's teleplay, 
directed by Jack Bender, the entitled "armed and innocent" is the family's 
11-year-old son (Andrew Starnes), who loses his innocence in a moment of 
domestic terror. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised by McRaney's otherwise devoted but gun-obsessed, macho dad to prize 
guns and hunt animals in the nearby woods, the boy is turned into a reluctant 
hero when he frantically surprises two burglars in his living room while home 
alone watching TV one afternoon after school. Instead of sensibly hiding in his 
room, he nervously loads his rifle and pumps the shocked, unarmed burglars full 
of deadly fire. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a hair-raising sequence that unleashes a host of emotional and social 
demons for the boy, whose shallow parents are too proud of their son's 
"heroism" and too thick-headed to cope with his subsequent depression and 
suppressed nightmares. Instead, it's up to a sensitive Vietnam vet neighbor 
(Cotter Smith) to convince the youth (and Jackson's finally awakened mom) of 
the importance of seeking help in order to unleash the turmoil pressed upon him 
by a world that wants to pin a medal on him. 
</P>
<P>
 As a portrait of a preteen boy warped by adults with a gun-toting mentality, 
this is a story that could profitably be distributed to schools and parent 
groups.

 GLITZ OR VALUE? The 1994 Zagat survey of the best Southern California 
restaurants was released this week.Tops in Orange County: For food, Pascal's in 
Newport Beach. For decor: The Towers at the Surf and Sand Hotel in Laguna Beach 
and the Ritz-Carlton hotel's dining room in Dana Point. For top value: Ruby's 
on the Balboa Pier. . . . Zagat says of Ruby's: "A sentimental ode to the '50s 
burger joint." Actually, says Ruby's manager Chris Rimer, "it's from the '40s. 
That's Glenn Miller in the background. But we'll take it. This is quite a plug

TOURISTS FIND THEMSELVES IN CENTER OF UNREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Foreign tourists drawn by the colonial charm of this beautiful mountain city 
have instead found themselves at the center of a powerful uprising by armed 
peasants against the Mexican army. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the insurrection began in the early hours of New Year's Day, dozens of 
U.S. and European visitors have fled San Cristobal, one of the oldest cities in 
Latin America and a showpiece of colonial architecture.More than 200 soldiers 
were deployed in the city late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting out of here. The rebels were fine, but I don't like the looks of 
these soldiers," British tourist Peter Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 But others say they have had a great time since the rebels marched into the 
city's central square, which is flanked by colonial-style hotels, a town hall 
and a cathedral, shortly after a New Year's Eve fireworks display. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no idea what they were doing at first, but then they started smashing 
in the doors of the town hall. We sat in the square drinking coffee and smoking 
and watched them until about 4 a.m.," said Phil McDonald, a Canadian tourist. 
</P>
<P>
 When daylight broke Saturday, dozens of tourists grabbed their cameras to 
shoot videotape and photographs of the rebels in combat dress and armed with 
rifles, shotguns and antique pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 San Cristobal, founded in 1528 with the Spanish conquest of the Americas, has 
for many years been among Mexico's top tourist attractions.

JUDGE LIKES DEFENDANTS TO WRITE THEIR WRONGS

<TEXT>
<P>
 One way to right a wrong is to write a lot, a judge believes. 
</P>
<P>
 District Judge Mike Erwin sentenced a shoplifter to write 10,000 times: "I 
will not steal other people's property." 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman, who pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to a 
burglary, had to write 10,000 times: "I will not do anything stupid again." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, who has issued dozens of such sentences, said he hopes forcing 
defendants to write about their crimes will make them think about what they 
have done.

IRS PAYMENTS

 * Re the editorial Dec. 22, "They Rarely Clean Up in Their Old Age." 
</P>
<P>
 You refer to "complicated quarterly filings" and "onerous paperwork," when 
nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterly form could not be simpler. You enter the total quarterly 
payments paid to the employee. Multiply that amount by 15.3% and write a check 
to the IRS in that amount and mail it with the form in the envelope provided by 
the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 It is outrageous that affluent employers, such as Bobby Inman and the others, 
do not comply with the law and it is inhumane to the domestic workers who work 
these menial jobs rather than rely on welfare and then are denied retirement 
benefits as well.

THE DISTANT HARM OF SALVADORAN SLAUGHTER; REPRESSION PROMPTS EMIGRATION, AND 
THAT AFFECTS L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the 1980s, the United States bankrolled a series of civilian and 
military regimes in El Salvador against the left-wing insurgency of the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). In the process, Washington 
often turned a blind eye to government-sponsored violence against Salvadoran 
civilians. In the last months of 1993 the State Department released more than 
12,000 papers documenting U.S. complicity in some of this violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The most famous case, dismissed at the time by the U.S. State Department, was 
the slaughter in the mountain village of El Mozote of at least 500 and quite 
possibly as many as 800 civilians, including at least 143 infants and children. 
The Dec. 6 issue of The New Yorker contains the fullest account yet of this 
atrocity, a book-length article by Mark Danner. Danner begins with the work of 
the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Unit, which set out painstakingly to exhume 
and analyze the victims, skeleton by shattered skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
 What impresses a Los Angeles reader of this account more than the sickening 
details of the slaughter and the cover-up is something that Danner mentions 
only in passing. The Salvadoran army's broad counterinsurgency strategy was 
that of "denying the fish their water." Guerrillas, in this metaphor, are fish; 
the general population is the water. The terrorization and forced relocation of 
the population dry up the water and expose the fish. Danner notes that in the 
remote border province of Morazan, where El Mozote is situated, this tactic had 
much of its intended effect. The peasants who were not slain in the army's 
savage "Hammer and Anvil" operation fled into Honduras, where reports 
confirming the El Mozote massacre, among others, were forwarded by U.S. 
officials in the area to the State Department (which suppressed the reports). 
By now, Danner reports, some of the "water" has flowed back, but much of it has 
not. Where has it gone? 
</P>
<P>
 Try Los Angeles, where some of the poorest, least-prepared Latino immigrants 
to have arrived in recent years are the Salvadoran victims of a decade of U.S. 
policy in their war-torn homeland. In the long run, they surely will enrich the 
city; but in the short run, their adjustment has been painful for them and 
costly for the community that took them in. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, regrettably, the sort of thing foreign policy planners rarely think 
about. We hope that, for the sake of Los Angeles as well as of El Salvador, 
they will think seriously about it in the few months that remain before El 
Salvador's election. U.N. monitors as well as human rights groups have reported 
an upsurge in activity by anti-communist death squads. Since last August, 20 
murders have occurred, including those of three FMLN candidates for the 
National Assembly. In November, the State Department sent Alexander Watson, 
assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, to San Salvador to 
warn all political sectors against engaging in violence. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a step in the right direction, but the Clinton Administration must not 
think that a re-escalation of violence in El Salvador will be a tragedy for 
that country alone. If it triggers a new wave of forced emigration, it could 
also be a painful and costly development for this city.

GUN, NUCLEAR THREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Gun violence has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. 
Physicians for Social Responsibility fully supports the reasonable measures to 
curb gun violence outlined in a recent series of Los Angeles Times 
editorials.We wish to clarify the perception of our work (Dec. 3). 
</P>
<P>
 While the Cold War has ended, and public perception of the threat has 
diminished, the actual threat from weapons of mass destruction remains and 
perhaps is growing, as many recent articles in The Times on proliferation 
issues in general and the North Korean nuclear program in particular have 
pointed out. We oppose the instruments of societal destruction in all their 
forms, whether it be the global threat from nuclear weapons or the massive 
proliferation of guns in our streets. We invite all to join efforts to abolish 
the threat from handguns and assault weapons as well as to eliminate nuclear, 
chemical, and biological weapons through the support of such measures as a 
comprehensive nuclear test ban and global ratification of the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty.

MOVE TO FREE JONATHAN POLLARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I find it ironic that President Clinton was visibly moved by "Schindler's 
List," a move about a man who violated his country's laws to save Jews, but 
that he is still unwilling to free Jonathan Pollard, who, 50 years after 
Schindler, broke his country's laws in an attempt to prevent another Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish that the President would express his appreciation of Oskar Schindler's 
actions by freeing Pollard; a year in an insane asylum and seven years in 
solitary is punishment enough for a man whose only motivation was his concern 
over the possibility of another Holocaust at the hands of a nuclear -- and 
chemically armed -- Iraq and who only transmitted information to which Israel 
was entitled by a solemn agreement between it and the U.S.

 In response to Leonard Garment's article ("The Penalty Has Gone Beyond the 
Crime," Commentary, Dec. 20): I am vehemently opposed to the author's view of 
rationalizing the acts of someone who takes the law into his own hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the U.S. government withheld vital information concerning Iraq's 
nuclear, chemical and bacteriological warfare capability is a serious matter. 
However, it is an absolute aberration for an individual to take matters of 
foreign policy into his/her own hands by acquiring sensitive government 
information and passing that information on to an ally without appropriate 
approvals. Such high-profile aberrations were, are and shall be punishable 
under the strictest codes of law. 
</P>
<P>
 If Pollard felt so compelled to take these matters into his own hands, he 
should have used a more conventional method, like diplomacy. I do not condone 
the "crime" of silence, nor do I condone individuals conducting U.S. foreign 
policy in a manner that is not conducive to normal diplomatic behavior.

 As a free-lance journalist specializing in U.S. covert operations, my research 
has frequently led me to sources and materials that overlap the covert 
operations of sometime-U.S.-proxy-agent Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 As a reader of the Hebrew press I can tell you that Leonard Garment would get 
a very strong argument from both the journalists and former Israeli Mossad and 
Aman (military intelligence) agents who have written extensively on the Pollard 
spy case. The general consensus is contrary to Garment's assertion that "Though 
Pollard was eventually given money, on the initiative of his handlers, it is 
generally recognized that money was not the motive for Pollard's decision to 
transmit U.S. intelligence information to Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli intelligence and Mossad agents have described how Pollard wangled 
first-class accommodations on the French Riviera for his rendezvous with his 
Mossad handlers, and have quoted Pollard's specific requests for payments that 
would make any ideological Zionist blush. Garment seems to be at this late date 
trying to revive the ideological motive angle used by Pollard in his own 
defense. Israeli mainstream journalists were repeating this line, catering to 
the masses of Likud supporters who wanted to see Pollard get off, as a prelude 
to clearing the names of the Israeli military brass who ran the LEKEM spy ring 
in the U.S. Eventually even mainstream Israeli journalists got around to noting 
Pollard's big-ticket expense account, and his less than pure motives.

 It is ironic that Caspar Weinberger -- who was doubtless responsible for the 
withholding of knowledge about Iraq capabilities that should have been shared 
with Israel under treaty as an ally, and so creating the dilemma for Pollard, 
which led to his crime and whose crucial affidavit falsely accused him of 
treason -- was pardoned on Dec. 24, 1992, by President Bush for the four counts 
of perjury and obstruction of justice in the Iran-Contra scandal without 
standing trial. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand Weinberger would not now oppose Clinton's commuting Pollard's 
sentence to time served. He has already served five years longer than anyone 
else convicted of a comparable crime.

<P>
 It appears that Pollard truly was treated unfairly and given a much harsher 
sentence than was warranted.  
</P>
<P>
 Nothing Pollard did resulted in one iota of harm to the U.S. The U.S. had 
promised our ally, Israel, to keep it informed and warned of potential threats 
from its hostile neighbors.  
</P>
<P>
 The judge dissenting on Pollard's harsh sentence, Stephen Williams, said: "The 
government's actions were such a 'fundamental miscarriage of justice' that the 
sentence should be overturned." U.S. disingenuousness in its policy toward 
Israel's legitimate defense in the midst of hostile enemies is a major reason 
for Israel's fears in the present peace process.

ANNENBERG GIFT TO SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bravo to Walter Annenberg and his efforts to improve the quality of education 
through his generous contribution (Dec. 17). 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last couple of years I have been a frequent guest in schools, most 
often invited by kindergartens and colleges. The environments differ only in 
scale. In the beginners' classroom and on university campuses the same 
opportunities and facilities exist. In kindergarten, however, the resources are 
in one room, with access for all. In college, the resources are in separate 
buildings, with limited availability. But the most apparent difference is in 
the self-image of the students. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask a kindergarten class, "How many of you can draw?" and all the hands shoot 
up. Yes, of course we can draw -- all of us. What can you draw? Anything! 
</P>
<P>
 How many of you can sing? All hands. Of course we sing! What can you sing? 
Anything! 
</P>
<P>
 How many of you dance? Unanimous again. What kind of music do you like to 
dance to? Any kind! 
</P>
<P>
 Do you like to act in plays? Yes! Do you play musical instruments? Yes! Do you 
write poetry? Yes! Can you read and write and count? Yes! We're learning that 
stuff now. 
</P>
<P>
 Their answer is yes! Over and over again, yes! The children are confident in 
spirit, infinite in resources, and eager to learn. Everything is still 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Try those same questions on a college audience. A small percentage of the 
students will raise their hands when asked if they draw or dance or sing or 
paint or act or play an instrument. Not infrequently, those who do raise their 
hands will want to qualify their response with their limitations: "I only play 
piano, I only draw horses, I only dance to rock and roll, I only sing in the 
shower." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why the limitations, college students answer they do not have 
talent, are not majoring in the subject, or have not done any of these things 
since about third grade, or worse, that they are embarrassed for others to see 
them sing or dance or act. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong between kindergarten and college? What happened to "yes! Of 
course I can"?

 Unfortunately, Walter Annenberg's sort of generosity does not usually inspire 
other multimillionaires, or even billionaires, to reach into their bulging 
mattresses and do some good for humanity with the contents. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Depression years of the '30s, when I was in school, there was 
little or no money around, but schools and libraries were not forced to close. 
Now, with so much money available, those institutions are in great trouble, 
obviously through mismanagement. Strange goings-on! I and millions of others 
thank God for Annenberg.

VITAMIN MAKERS CAN SWALLOW NEW RULES; FEDERAL REQUIREMENT OF SCIENTIFIC PROOF 
OF BENEFITS WILL HELP VALIDATE THE INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's keep something straight about the new regulations on vitamins issued by 
the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA is not saying, "Do not take 
vitamins." The agency is not saying, "Do not sell vitamins." It is only 
requiring that vitamin and dietary supplement makers provide us with accurate 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 They must, for example, substantiate with scientific evidence any health 
claims they make in selling their products. That's the same FDA standard that 
is applied to processed foods. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules are a long-overdue move in the public interest and will help 
protect the integrity of the $4-billion dietary supplement industry, though 
many manufacturers are objecting to the added cost of compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Objections notwithstanding, consumers need some measure of protection against 
many of the unsubstantiated and even fraudulent health claims found on some 
vitamins, mineral and other supplements. So beginning July 1, vitamin and 
dietary supplement makers must provide scientific evidence to back up any 
health claims. Beginning in mid-1995, manufacturers also will have to list 
nutrients, such as sugars and fats, on the labels of supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 The new FDA requirements, which apply only to what manufacturers can say on 
the product label or in sales materials, should not restrict the availability 
of legitimate products or research data on benefits not yet validated by the 
FDA.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Congress may move to water down the requirements when it 
reconvenes. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.) have 
introduced bills to limit the FDA's authority over dietary supplements. Bad 
idea. The larger consumer interest should prevail over narrow industry 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who already take vitamins and other supplements, the new FDA 
requirements should enhance and validate information about these products. For 
the uninitiated, the requirements should help them through the bewildering 
number of products and weed out unsubstantiated claims, like garlic inhibiting 
the growth of viruses, yucca helping fight arthritis and gout, or hawthorn 
helping to lower blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing accurate nutritional and health information to consumers should be a 
high priority for the dietary supplement industry. Until now, the industry was 
barely subject to regulation. The FDA requirements should enhance confidence 
among health-conscious Americans, the very consumers of vitamins and minerals. 
Remember, the customer always comes first.

PERSPECTIVE ON WELFARE; THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A REAL JOB; REFORM REQUIRES 
PROVIDING CONSTRUCTIVE WORK FOR THOSE ALREADY RECEIVING 'INCOME' FROM 
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES N. ADLER, James N. Adler is a lawyer and chairman of the Los Angeles 
County Public Social Services Commission. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton in a recent press conference spoke eloquently of the 
importance of having a job, both to the individual and to the fabric of our 
society. Without the structure and opportunity to contribute meaningfully to 
society -- features of almost all jobs -- people deteriorate mentally and 
physically, their families disintegrate or become dysfunctional, their children 
become disadvantaged and often delinquent and their communities become 
dilapidated. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every governmental agency that impacts our lives, however, is so 
strapped for resources that even essential services are not being adequately 
funded. Our cities are filthy, our libraries are closing or drastically cutting 
hours, our schools are overcrowded, law-enforcement agencies are understaffed. 
At the same time, government at almost every level is spending billions in 
welfare, subsidizing millions of people to be idle. As a result, one essential 
component of a job -- income -- is provided, at least minimally, through our 
nation's welfare systems. What is missing is constructive work. 
</P>
<P>
 Our nation does not need a massive infusion of new governmental spending to 
provide new jobs. What is needed is increased work opportunity for those 
already receiving income through various welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the same money being spent now were paid in the same amounts to the same 
persons in "the form of payments for work performed," as federal law once 
authorized, rather than in the form of welfare checks, tens of thousands of 
persons in Los Angeles alone could be gainfully employed. Moreover, we can 
convert our welfare programs into job programs with modest no-cost or low-cost 
changes in federal, state and local laws. 
</P>
<P>
 This proposal is not pie-in-the-sky social engineering or wishful thinking. 
Already in Los Angeles County, approximately 17,000 of the 55,000 employable 
persons on general relief work eight or more days a month to "work off" their 
grants. These men and women clean our beaches and highways, work in hospitals, 
clean police stations and wash patrol cars, repair street lights, maintain 
public parks and assist in juvenile facilities. But they could do even more if 
our public and nonprofit agencies made more and better use of this resource. 
Instead of competing with each other for scarce taxpayer dollars, agencies 
could compete for this source of labor, without cost to any governmental agency 
or nonprofit organization that will provide supervision and workers' 
compensation insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 To facilitate the transformation from welfare to jobs, two further 
developments are crucial, and neither is beyond the means or the will of this 
community. First, more work opportunities are needed. When more governmental 
agencies and nonprofit organizations become aware of the success other agencies 
are experiencing, the number of job opportunities should increase 
substantially. Four to 10 people on general relief could be assigned to an 
agency, to be supervised by that organization's front-line workers. No regular 
employee would lose a job and the agency's budget would be little affected, but 
the services provided to the community would be measurably expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, work opportunities provided should be made more job-like by tying the 
amount of money received more closely to the amount of work performed. For 
example, after the first grant, entitlement to additional grants could be tied 
directly to work. If a worker missed an hour of work that was not made up, the 
worker would lose $4.25, just as in a regular job, rather than risking a 30-day 
or 60-day sanction as at present. If work opportunities were available and 
required for all employable persons on general relief, it would not be 
necessary to impose upon them, as we do now, the demeaning and often fruitless 
requirement of securing a certain number of rejections for regular employment 
as a condition of continuing eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Other modifications -- such as permitting workers to retain all or most of 
supplemental earnings and to accumulate up to $1,500 in assets for deposits on 
apartments to break out of the welfare system -- also are worth experimenting 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these proposals are being considered now on a pilot basis in Los 
Angeles County. By restructuring general relief and providing work to all 
employable people receiving it, this county can stop subsidizing destructive 
idleness and assist the government and nonprofit agencies in providing 
additional services. And, the county could demonstrate that using the resources 
of welfare programs themselves to fund jobs is one of the most cost-effective 
ways to eliminate welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 If the demonstration works for general relief, it could become a model for 
reforming the federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. In each 
case, the same money could be paid for work performed, thus reinforcing work 
habits and rekindling pride. Or, we can continue to pay welfare stipends. Is 
there really any choice?

THE WORLD IS SMALLER THAN WE THINK; SOCIETY: A NEW MOVIE REVIVES THE HYPOTHESIS 
OF THE ULTIMATE LINK BETWEEN ANY TWO PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD R. SUSSMAN, Leonard R. Sussman is senior scholar of Freedom House, 
which monitors political rights and liberties worldwide. His latest book is The 
Culture of FreedomThe Small World of Fulbright Scholars (Roman & Littlefield, 
1992.) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Six Degrees of Separation," a hit Broadway play, has now opened as a movie, 
and its intriguing title may enter the books of familiar quotations. It refers, 
without credit, to a thesis developed some years ago by a serious researcher at 
MIT, which I think has relevance today to President Clinton's fellow Rhodes 
scholars.  
</P>
<P>
 I came across that connection while writing a book about the Fulbright 
program, which sends 5,000 scholars into other countries each year. Like the 
Rhodes scholars, they create a "small world" of lifetime reactions. And like 
Clinton, who has taken many of his Rhodes cronies to the White House, they have 
an impact on the larger world. 
</P>
<P>
 The white woman in "Six Degrees" is thrilled to hear that a young black man 
who suddenly appears in her apartment has connections with her family and 
friends. She intones the title line almost prayerfully; to her, the black-white 
separation has suddenly dissolved and a world of connections seems possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, Ithiel de Sola Pool, a world-renowned communications scholar at 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had the idea that seven 
intermediaries, at most, were sufficient to link most pairs of people in the 
world. Manfred Kochen, who helped Pool design a mathematical formula for 
proving the idea, called it the "small-world phenomenon": Two people with no 
apparent ties to one another meet for the first time and discover an 
acquaintance in common. One is likely to exclaim, "It's a small world, isn't 
it? " 
</P>
<P>
 Such happenings have considerable value. At root, they are the basis for 
international exchanges of scholars. The participants' lives are forever 
changed by the new friends and cultures they encounter abroad. Such connections 
have political as well as scholarly implications. It is easier to negotiate 
with friends or even adversaries abroad if significant actors in each country 
have had sound education in the other's customs, interests and aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, a similar process is common. Kochen observes that "the widespread 
availability of good connections, direct and indirect, and their systematic 
use" extensively employs personal networks, for example, in job-seeking, 
commercial sales and lobbying Congress. Ithiel Pool, as I knew him, was deeply 
concerned with encouraging access to political movers in a democratic society. 
He regarded the new communications technologies as the ultimate link in 
personal networking. 
</P>

 The eminent political scientist Karl W. Deutsch brought Pool and Kochen 
together in 1957. Pool had already conceived such networking as a fit subject 
for scholarly and scientific research. He recognized the degrees of separation 
as a phenomenon requiring mathematical proof. Kochen would provide that 
expertise. For 20 years, they labored over the problem. Finally, in 1978, they 
published their working paper in the first issue of Social Networks. That paper 
stimulated interest by other scholars.  
</P>
<P>
 Social psychologist Stanley Milgrim devised "the small-world method," a 
passport to be sent to many acquaintances, enabling one to trace the course of 
the paper, like the movement of a chain letter. Theodore Newcomb, also a social 
psychologist, described "the acquaintance process" in the fashion of his 
academic specialty. All three -- Pool, Milgrim and Newcomb -- died in 1984. But 
their work continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutsch, writing in Kochen's book, "The Small World" (Ablex, 1989), mentions 
the suggestion made by four scholars: that 20 large polling samples of 
Americans could reveal the typical network sizes for a variety of citizens. 
This could be determined, for example, by asking whether the respondent knew 
personally anyone killed in the Vietnam War or by a drunk driver in the past 12 
months or anyone infected by AIDS or anyone in some other group of known size. 
From this, the "degree of separation" could begin to be formalized.  
</P>
<P>
 This research has other valuable potentials. By learning the paths of contact 
-- the channels that end separation and lead to connection -- one can 
eventually expand and systematize connections worldwide. Rapidly expanding 
computer networking, aided by satellite and fiber-optic land links -- all at 
steadily declining cost -- can convert personal interactions across borders 
into political democratization. 
</P>
<P>
 That, too, was Ithiel de Sola Pool's dream as he spoke of the technologies of 
freedom, the driving force for converting degrees of separation into an 
interactive, small world.

REAGANOMICS-IN-THE-TROPICS FALTERS; LATIN AMERICA: VOTERS ARE REJECTING 
ECONOMIC SHOCK TREATMENTS AND RIGID TWO-PARTY DIVISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORGE G. CASTANEDA, Jorge G. Castaneda is a political scientist who teaches 
at Mexican and U.S. universities. His latest book is Utopia Unarmed: The Latin 
American Left After the Cold War. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been a long time coming, but a Latin American electorate has finally 
rejected the Reaganomics-in-the-Tropics scheme of economic and social policy 
that has reigned supreme across the hemisphere since the late 1980s. In 
Venezuela, the region's oldest standing two-party system provided voters with a 
substantive choice on Dec. 5: more of the same policies that had been 
implemented by President Carlos Andres Perez before he was impeached, such as 
trade liberalization, privatizations, wage freezes, subsidy cuts and higher 
prices for public goods and services, or a rejection of those options in favor 
of a so-called adjustment with a human face and a social conscience. 
Venezuelans decisively chose the latter approach. 
</P>
<P>
 In Peru in 1990, voters thought they were rejecting the option of an economic 
shock treatment, as proposed by writer Mario Vargas Llosa. In fact, that's what 
they got, in spades, through the ideological about-face of Vargas Llosa's 
rival, Alberto Fujimori. In Argentina, last October's congressional vote was an 
endorsement of President Carlos Menem's policies, although the voters may have 
been swayed by false premises. And in Chile, on Dec. 12, voters overwhelmingly 
elected Eduardo Frei to the presidency, but as head of a coalition in which 
everyone could find something to like: Some thought they were voting for a 
partial continuation of the radical free-market policies of the Pinochet years; 
others expected repayment of the "social debt," a keystone of the outgoing 
Christian Democratic administration of Patricio Aylwin. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Venezuela, the electorate expressed itself clearly and knowingly by 
giving 28% of the vote to old-timer Rafael Caldera, who won the presidency, and 
27% to center-leftist Andres Velazquez. Both ran against neo-liberalism's 
radical free-market policies. For the first time, the fashionable and 
supposedly inevitable trend was voted down, the supposedly archaic and not 
viable was voted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Matters are, of course, more complicated than this brief assessment suggests. 
To begin with, the corruption and discredit of Perez explains much of his 
party's debacle. The entire political elite has been tainted by scandal, 
largely because the two-party system in Venezuela is more a formalistic facade 
than a forum for exercising apposite ideological tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 As Terry Karl, one scholar of the country's 1959-60 transition from 
dictatorship, put it, "Regardless of who won the elections, each party was 
promised participation in the political and economic pie." The two military 
coup attempts of 1992 were largely directed against this cozy arrangement. 
Either the pie had to be split differently, or those gorging on it would have 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the sea change symbolized by the Venezuelan elections may consist in 
the end of these types of political systems, where ideological, social, ethnic 
and even regional cleavages are wished away or ignored. Complex, urban, 
literate and ideologically diverse societies without long-standing party 
loyalties or traditions cannot fit into neat, simple categories -- Liberals or 
Conservatives in Colombia, Peronists or radicals in Argentina and their 
traditional equivalents in Venezuela, Costa Rica and Uruguay, among others. 
Splintered electorates, atomized parties and the broad coalitions needed to 
stitch them together should be the norm in incipient democracies like Latin 
America's. Only then can the true colors and quirks of deeply divided nations 
be identified and addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 And only when the economic policies applauded in Washington for others (but 
becoming discarded for Americans) actually deliver the goods will they receive 
the type of support that democracy requires. Growth is flattening out in the 
more recently successful Latin American economies -- Chile, Argentina; it has 
simply vanished in others, like Mexico and Venezuela. Income inequality, for 
example, has become worse in Mexico, despite poverty alleviation programs.  
</P>
<P>
 1994 will see a rash of presidential elections in Latin America, ranging from 
tiny El Salvador to Brazil and Mexico, from Colombia to Costa Rica. In each 
one, a pair of issues seem to be dividing the electorate: continuity vs. 
change, neo-liberal adjustment vs. something ill-defined but strongly embraced: 
growth, justice, jobs, dignity. Voting for all of the above is no guarantee of 
achieving any of these aims. But there is every reason to believe that more and 
more Latin Americans over the next 12 months will follow the Venezuelan path, 
wherever it actually may lead.

 METER READERS? County officials may soon follow a foreign ruler. County 
supervisors are expected to agree today to study use of the metric system for 
some functions.It's mainly to prepare for a federal switch to metric in 1996 
for highway projects. . . . For example, new street widths would be designed in 
meters instead of feet. County public works director W.L. Zaun sees no problem: 
"It's a matter of deciding you are going to make the change and doing it."

RSVP / ORANGE COUNTY; SINGLES BOOK PASSAGE FOR A NIGHT AT RICK'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, the Bogart & Bacall 
chapter of the Guilds of the Orange County Performing Arts Center chose 
Remick's restaurant in Irvine to stage its "Night in Casablanca" New Year's Eve 
gala. 
</P>
<P>
 The young singles chapter re-created Rick's Cafe Americain from the movie 
"Casablanca" for the fund-raiser, issuing passports to about 300 guests and 
setting up a makeshift casino so party-goers could gamble beneath the palm 
trees and ceiling fans. The $60-per-person bash was expected to net about 
$5,000 for the center. As Time Goes By 
</P>
<P>
 The revelers looked like the bar patrons at Rick's Cafe: The women sported 
sparkling cocktail dresses and the men a mix of suits and tuxedos. After posing 
for pictures to put in their souvenir passports, they wandered up and down the 
staircase of the two-story restaurant, trying their luck at blackjack or 
dancing as DJ Marc Ces spun the records, and sampling a fully loaded buffet. 
The fare included roast turkey, roast beef, made-to-order pastas with sauces 
and toppings as well as fresh fruit tarts and cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My New Year's resolution is to gain weight. I never keep them, so I'm hoping 
this way I'll lose weight instead," said Richard Hill, event co-chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests ushered in the New Year in traditional fashion -- with kisses, a 
champagne toast and a rain of confetti. Play It Again, Sam 
</P>
<P>
 Bogart & Bacall's first New Year's bash was such a hit last year members 
decided to do it again. Other activities staged by the chapter in 1993 included 
a night at the performing arts center to see the "Nutcracker" and a car rally 
in which members had to search for clues that led them to a Temecula winery. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogart & Bacall is open to single professionals age 25 to 45. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started the chapter two years ago with the idea that younger people 
(should) get involved in the arts," said Patricia Migatulski, chapter 
chairwoman, who helped found the group. "It's a way to meet quality people. 
It's not a pick-up scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Members like the fact that the group is for singles but doesn't have the 
stigma of a singles dating club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of a friendly atmosphere," said Debra Henderson, program 
chairwoman. "It's like somebody's having a party and you're invited." 
</P>
<P>
 Other faces in the crowd included event co-chairman Robert Mitchell, Sid Baum, 
Sue George, Joseph Mingrone, Jan Wilfley, Ellen Lean, Eileen Hurley, Tom Machos 
and Jim Luzzi. KATHRYN BOLD

2,500 FELLOW OFFICERS AT FUNERAL FOR GANZ; SLAYING: GOVERNOR, MANHATTAN BEACH 
CHIEF PAY TRIBUTE TO POLICEMAN SHOT BY MOTORIST. SISTER SAYS VICTIM'S HAPPIEST

<P>
 More than 2,500 law enforcement officers from Los Angeles and surrounding 
communities turned out Monday to honor slain Manhattan Beach Police Officer 
Martin L. Ganz, the first officer to be gunned down in the quiet seaside 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The uniformed officers, Gov. Pete Wilson and Manhattan Beach Police Chief Ted 
Mertens joined Ganz's family and hundreds of grieving friends to remember Ganz 
as a devoted police officer who loved to work with children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the true meaning of Martin's commitment can be found in the faces 
of children throughout this community and others whose lives he touched," 
Mertens said of Ganz, who became a police officer in Manhattan Beach in 1989. 
"Martin was truly a man of principles, values and ideals who loved his job." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson pledged that law enforcement and government officials will "not rest 
until the thug that took his life is brought to justice." 
</P>
<P>
 "Martin has left a legacy to us," Wilson said. "He has entrusted us with a 
dream of a safe and decent California. It is our responsibility to honor his 
memory and to accept that trust and complete the job for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz, 29, died the night of Dec. 27 after he was gunned down by a motorist he 
had pulled over outside the Manhattan Village shopping mall. No arrests have 
been made, and police have yet to come up with a motive for the shooting. The 
shooting was witnessed by Ganz's 13-year-old nephew, who had accompanied the 
officer on routine patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have released a sketch of a suspect, described as an Asian man in his 
late 20s or early 30s with a medium build. Investigators are continuing to 
search for the drivers of two vehicles filmed by a nearby bank camera who may 
have witnessed the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tearful eulogy to her brother, Janet Chase recalled how Ganz always had 
dreamed of becoming a police officer. She said the day he graduated from the 
police academy and the day he got a job with the Manhattan Beach Police 
Department were "two of the best days of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I saw him was at our family Christmas party," Chase said. "He 
had to leave the party early because he had to go to work. He was so happy. 
Before he left, he gave me a big bear hug and said, 'Goodby, Janet. I love 
you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the 90-minute service, broadcast on speakers and television sets to an 
overflow crowd gathered in the parking lot and in an adjacent auditorium of 
American Martyrs Church in Manhattan Beach, hundreds of law enforcement 
officers in squad cars and on motorcycles led the mile-long funeral procession 
to Inglewood Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 For police officers from Los Angeles to San Diego, Ganz's death seemed to 
underscore the increasingly violent nature of the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sign of the times," said Officer Steve Gentry of the Inglewood Police 
Department. "You've got kids growing up in a world where people just don't flat 
out care anymore. There's no one to teach them respect for police officers. 
There's no respect for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Tom Dorsey of the Torrance Police Department added: "More people have 
guns now and are more willing to use them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz was the third officer killed in Southern California in the last five 
weeks. Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins was fatally shot by a 
fellow officer in an informal police training session on Christmas Day. Oxnard 
Police Detective James E. O'Brien was shot to death Dec. 2 while trying to 
apprehend a man who had shot up an Oxnard unemployment office, killing three 
and wounding four. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few feet from Ganz's cemetery plot lay another slain policeman, Compton 
Officer Kevin Burrell, who was shot to death along with his partner, James 
McDonald, last March after they had stopped two suspects in a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who paid tribute to Ganz on Monday were several Manhattan Beach 
elementary school students enrolled in anti-drug abuse classes taught by the 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the nicest people I've ever known," said 12-year-old Kelly 
Sullivan. "He loved everyone."

STINGING MEDICINE; BEE VENOM TREATMENT GIVEN MS VICTIMS AT VALLEY HOME 
</P>

 The stinging hour has begun at Shirley Checkos' house, and half a dozen people 
in her living room wait with a mixture of eagerness and dread as she reaches 
into an old mayonnaise jar for more bees. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabbing the insects with long tweezers, she presses them, one by one, against 
bare shoulders, backs and knees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ow! You really got me!" yelps a woman who has arrived with the help of a 
walker. But a man in a wheelchair serenely asserts that he can't feel the 
stingers plunging into his knees. 
</P>
<P>
 The people in Checkos' San Fernando Valley home have multiple sclerosis, an 
incurable and often disabling nerve disease. Although medical experts discount 
the effectiveness of bee venom, these MS sufferers believe it can help them. 
And, anyway, the woman they call "Sure Sting Shirley" doesn't charge for her 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Checkos, 48, has been stinging MS patients since her husband, Larry, a 
waterproofing contractor with MS, got the stinging treatment from a Maryland 
woman in September and felt better immediately. Since then, the Checkoses have 
turned their Tudor-style home in Granada Hills into a sort of mini-Lourdes, 
attracting a small but growing coterie of MS victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Checkos treats about 10 MS sufferers, giving them as many as 25 stings 
at a time, three times a week. She has given her husband nearly 500 altogether. 
After one recent session, his lower back was a mass of red welts. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical authorities will not say categorically that bee venom does not help 
some MS patients. But they say there is no scientific evidence to support the 
notion that bee stings can relieve the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, MS is known for the mysterious waning and waxing of its symptoms. 
And natural slowdowns in the disease's progression often are mistakenly 
attributed to questionable treatments such as bee stings, said Stephen 
Reingold, vice president of research and medical programs at the National 
Multiple Sclerosis Society in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Reingold also warned of anaphylactic shock, an allergic reaction to bee venom, 
that he said kills 10,000 Americans each year. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 330,000 Americans have MS. Its precise cause is unknown, but it 
is thought to be an immune-system malfunction that prompts the body to 
mistakenly attack myelin sheaths that protect nerve fibers in the brain, spine 
and eyes. Scarring of the myelin interferes with the transmission of nerve 
impulses between the brain and muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 Resulting symptoms include difficulty in walking, blurred vision, excessive 
fatigue, bladder and bowel incontinence, numbness, loss of balance, tremors, 
slurred speech and, in severe cases, partial or total paralysis, which in rare 
cases leads to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Often promoted by commercial beekeepers, bee venom is an old folk treatment 
that has been used for decades by lay practitioners against MS, arthritis and 
other illnesses. But it has never been tested on humans in a controlled, 
scientific fashion, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and 
thus remains in the realm of unproven treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in bee-sting therapy, also known as apitherapy, was renewed this year 
by a wave of media reports about two bee-sting practitioners: Pat Wagner, a 
Maryland woman whose home attracts droves of the sick, and Charles Mraz, an 
88-year-old, Middlebury, Vt., beekeeper widely viewed as an apitherapy guru. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Mraz said he has treated people with MS for eight years, and 
he claims that the stings have eliminated symptoms in at least two people. He 
said he began believing in bee venom after stings cured him of rheumatic fever 
at age 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can't tell the difference between therapeutic effect and . . . 
spontaneous remission, I should get the hell out of this," he said. "People 
that have MS, they know the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Checkos could not agree more. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagnosed as having MS at age 28, he developed most of the classic symptoms. 
For one terrifying day, he was completely paralyzed. His legs were so weak that 
his son had to carry him up the stairs to bed. He had trouble controlling his 
bladder. By last summer, he was in a wheelchair, an agonizing disability for a 
once-vigorous man who had enjoyed skiing, bowling, hiking and bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
 But after receiving nine stings from Pat Wagner in September, Larry Checkos, 
now 44, said he felt his condition improve immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 He is by no means cured, he said. But he can drive a car again and walk, 
albeit shakily. His bladder problems have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never felt this much energy from a little bitty bee before in my life," 
he said. "It's amazing. It's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Checkos' neurologist, Dr. Ronald Lawrence, a professor at UCLA School of 
Medicine, confirmed that Checkos has MS and was recently in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Checkos was stung, his leg muscles are slightly stronger and his vision 
has improved somewhat, Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, the physician added: "I didn't notice any remarkable change. He still has 
MS, and he's still going to have remissions and exacerbations." There is no way 
to tell if Checkos' mild improvements were the result of bee venom or natural 
fluctuations in the disease, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Lawrence said he isn't opposed to bee sting therapy. "If the 
patient is helped and not harmed, and it doesn't cost a lot of money . . . what 
the heck?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not outlandish. If nothing else, it's painless (for some) and it's 
not harmful," said Walter Uhrman, a wheelchair-bound Northridge attorney who 
has had MS for 19 years and received his first stings from Shirley Checkos on a 
recent weekday. 
</P>
<P>
 Checkos gets her bees from a Van Nuys beekeeper whom she refuses to name. She 
said she is fully aware of the risks of anaphylactic shock, and insists that 
people who visit her be screened for allergic reaction by their doctors 
beforehand and bring along an antidote kit when they go to her house. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Medical Board of California said Shirley Checkos' 
activities "could be construed" as illegally practicing medicine without a 
license. But the spokeswoman conceded that state authorities are unlikely to 
seek prosecution of Checkos because she operates on such a small scale and has 
not been the target of consumer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 MS experts acknowledge that bee venom contains at least three compounds that 
may enhance conductivity through damaged nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also say that MS patients often respond strongly to the disease's 
well-known "placebo effect." Experts noted that the mere hope of getting better 
from a given treatment can produce striking improvements in MS sufferers, even 
if the remedy has no therapeutic value, such as placebos in drug trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Bee venom is hardly the first unproven remedy to be zealously embraced by MS 
patients desperate enough to try almost anything that promises relief. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At one time or another, more than 130 forms of treatment -- including scorpion 
venom, electrical stimulation of the spine and cleansing of the blood -- have 
been touted as effective until later studies pointed up their shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society are dismayed that they 
have received so many inquiries about bee venom at a time when they are trying 
to get word out about a newly approved MS drug, Betaseron. The compound has 
been proven in clinical tests to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms 
in the relatively mild "relapsing-remitting" form of MS. About 25% of MS 
sufferers have that type. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the drug's maker, Berlex Laboratories of Richmond, Calif., 
said about 70,000 people have signed up for the compound, which will cost about 
$10,000 annually per individual. But because of insufficient production 
capacity, those toward the end of the waiting list will not be able to get the 
drug until late 1994 or early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Such delays, and the drug's relatively narrow application, have angered many 
MS patients and their families, including Shirley and Larry Checkos. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's got to be a ray of hope for these people," Shirley Checkos said. "And 
everyone I've been helping with bee stings is getting better. I just feel 
there's got to be something for these people to look forward to."

TAXIWAY TOO WEAK FOR 727S, OFFICIALS SAY; AIRPORT: SNAKEBIT BADGER FANS FINALLY 
GET TO GO HOME. CHARTERED JET'S OWNER SAYS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ORDERED 
PLANE ONTO THE ASPHALT VAN NUYS STRIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A chartered jetliner sank into the asphalt at Van Nuys Airport -- a last-straw 
climax to the Rose Bowl visit of a planeload of irritated Wisconsin football 
fans -- because it had somehow taxied onto pavement too weak to support such a 
large plane, airport officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boeing 727, carrying 137 homesick Badger fans, got stuck because its 
landing gear punched through thin pavement meant only for smaller planes, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The question was: Why was it there? 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas-based owner of the jet, Express One International, said that 
Federal Aviation Administration controllers in the tower of the city-owned 
airport directed the 727 to the location. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our pilots did not pick that route," said Stephen Thompkins, general counsel 
for Express One. "It's not like a shopping mall where you take your car and 
park it anywhere you can find. The control tower told the aircraft to proceed 
to taxiway Echo, and that was the only way to get there. When the 727 suddenly 
started to sink, it was as much a surprise to our crew as anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot immediately brought the jet to a stop and no one was hurt in the 
mishap, but the passengers had to be taken off the plane, temporarily housed in 
a hotel, fed and then late Sunday night bused to Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 They finally left for Madison, Wis., about 2:30 a.m. Monday aboard a 
replacement jet flown in from Minneapolis by the tour operator. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is determined that the airport -- which is responsible for maintenance 
of the asphalt strip -- is at fault, the mishap could end up costing the city a 
bit of money. The tour operator, Front Page Tours of Minneapolis, footed the 
bill for the replacement jet and other expenses caused by the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure at this time who will end of paying," said company President 
Dick Page. "But we'll be talking to everyone involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The airport mishap added insult to injury for the tour passengers, who began 
their weekend holiday in Los Angeles with the news that the Rose Bowl tickets 
they had been promised as part of their package would not be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry government officials in Wisconsin have asked California state and 
federal officials to investigate the situation that left fans with the 
unappetizing option of paying hundreds of dollars to buy game tickets from 
scalpers or watch their beloved team make its first Rose Bowl appearance in 
three decades on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Page said he was glad that his company had been contracted only for 
transportation and had nothing to do with the ticket foul-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the boarding area used by the jet at Van Nuys Airport is owned 
by Peterson Aviation, which provides aircraft services and leases a part of the 
facility that usually has been used for airplanes and small jets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically didn't know they were going to have anything as heavy as a 727 
there," said airport manager Ron Kochevar. 
</P>
<P>
 The airplanes and jets usually serviced by Peterson weigh about 6,000 to 
75,000 pounds, Kochevar said, while a fully loaded Boeing 727 weighs about 
160,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch of asphalt, which Kochevar described as a "transitional area" off 
the airport's taxiway, is only two to three inches thick. "The trouble is, 
there is no base under it," as there is under the heavier-duty taxiways and 
runways, Kochevar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport manager said the incident is under investigation, but believes 
that it is possible that tower controllers were never told by airport 
administrators that the transitional area could not handle a heavy jet.

HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM BAKES THE SOUTHLAND; WEATHER: STORMS ARE BLOCKED TO THE 
NORTH. DESPITE SUNNY SKIES AND RECORD TEMPERATURES, FORECASTERS SAY CHANCES ARE 
STILL GOOD FOR A WET WINTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A massive high-pressure system brought more sunny skies and record 
temperatures to Southern California on Monday, but forecasters said chances are 
still good for above-average rainfall here this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Top readings in the 70s broke records in Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo and 
Santa Barbara on Monday, and the high of 86 at the Los Angeles Civic Center 
fell just one degree short of the record for the date, set in 1902. 
</P>
<P>
 The overnight low in Downtown Los Angeles was 59 degrees, which tied the 
previous record high minimum for the date, established in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
 The balmy weather that started before Christmas has come from a series of 
high-pressure systems that have blocked the usual onshore flow of moist, marine 
air from the Pacific while holding wintry storms at bay, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 One such storm from the Gulf of Alaska had been headed this way for several 
days, and it looked for a while as though there could be at least a few 
sprinkles here by tonight. However, an unusually strong ridge of high pressure 
built over Southern California on Monday, forming a barrier that will keep the 
main body of the storm well to the north, meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm system should bring cloudiness that will keep today's temperatures 
at least 10 degrees cooler than Monday's, but no rain is expected south of the 
San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who thinks it has been drier than usual here lately is right. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service said the total rainfall in Los Angeles during 
December was only 0.78 of an inch, about 1.25 inches less than normal for the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said conditions still 
appear to be shaping up for normal -- or above-normal -- rainfall in January 
and February, the months during which Los Angeles usually gets its heaviest 
rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Measurements by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration 
continue to confirm a return of El Nino -- a phenomenon of shifting winds and 
ocean currents that generally brings unusually heavy rainfall to Southern 
California during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon, which prevailed in late 1992 and early 1993 after an 
eight-year hiatus, is thought to have caused last winter's unusually wet 
conditions in California and extreme cold in the eastern United States, along 
with last spring's severe flooding in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being -- at least through Saturday -- there is no rain in sight 
for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 And after that? 
</P>
<P>
 "The El Nino pattern hasn't let up," Brack said. "January and February are 
normally the wettest months. It could still happen."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BRAWL IN 
CELL AT COURTS BUILDING INJURES 3 INMATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A brief brawl in a holding cell at the Downtown Criminal Courts Building on 
Monday resulted in minor injuries to three inmates, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred about 7 a.m., lasted about four minutes and involved 20 
of 47 inmates who were in the cell next to a 10th-floor courtroom, said Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Irma Becerra. 
</P>
<P>
 Becerra said the fight fell along racial lines with Latino and black inmates 
battling each other, though the cause was not known. Deputies broke up the 
brawl without the use of force, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous recent fights in jail facilities around the county have also been 
described as being racially motivated. The three inmates injured Monday were 
sent for treatment for cuts and abrasions at the jail ward at Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center, Becerra said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; LYLE MENENDEZ 
JURORS EACH QUESTIONED BY JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deliberations in the Menendez brothers' murder trial, which resumed Monday 
after a three-day weekend, were interrupted for one of the two juries as the 
judge held one-on-one questioning with the panelists behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg quizzed jurors on the Lyle 
Menendez panel about "alleged possible misconduct by individual jurors" but 
found no wrongdoing, according to a statement issued through a court 
spokeswoman.The judge then ordered deliberations to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors are subject to many restrictions, such as not to follow news coverage 
of the trial or discuss the case outside the jury room. 
</P>
<P>
 The questioning of jurors came as Lyle Menendez's jury entered its 13th day of 
deliberations. Erik Menendez's jury was in its 11th day of deliberations on a 
different floor of the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juries heard the case against the brothers because some evidence was 
admitted against only one defendant. Lyle Menendez, 25, and Erik Menendez, 23, 
are charged with murder in the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their 
parents, Jose Menendez, 45, and Kitty Menendez, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Monday, the Lyle Menendez jury heard the re-reading of testimony about 
how the brothers used false identification to buy shotguns two days before the 
slayings.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN WHO ROBBED TO WARN 
OF NUCLEAR ATTACK GETS 30 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted bank robber was sentenced to 30 years in prison Monday after 
telling a federal judge that he stole nearly $1 million from nine San Fernando 
Valley banks to warn the public of a coming nuclear attack by the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal jury in October rejected James Ambrose McGrath's defense that God 
told him to rob banks, convicting him on 18 counts of armed robbery and weapons 
violations in connection with a string of robberies in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 During a Monday hearing, McGrath again asserted that his primary motive for 
committing the robberies was "to warn the United States that Japan is planning 
a sneak thermonuclear attack against us." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, U.S. District Judge Harry L. Hupp sentenced him to 30 years in 
prison, frustrating prosecutors who had asked the judge to impose a 165-year 
sentence on the nine-time bank robber. 
</P>
<P>
 "We disagree with the sentence," Assistant U.S. Atty. Christopher Tayback 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hupp said he would not impose a sentence that would equate to life in 
prison because of McGrath's mental condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike many bank robbers who are robbing to build up their stash of cash . . 
. this bank robber was operating under a heavy mental state," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI arrested McGrath in March, 1992, after the robbery of a Homes Savings 
of America branch in Woodland Hills. Authorities discovered a cache of 119 guns 
and more than 27,000 rounds of ammunition during a search of a lavish home he 
shared with another man in West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath's attorney, John D. Robertson, urged jurors to find his client insane, 
arguing that he suffers from delusions of devils and fallen angels. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath testified during his trial that "the Lord specifically commanded me to 
rob the banks so that's what I did." God also told him to use gloves and 
disguises, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A March 8 trial date has been set for a co-defendant, Gilbert David Michaels, 
who recently was found competent to stand trial. JULIE TAMAKI

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MOTORISTS' ATTACKS ON 
OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fatal shooting Dec. 27 of Manhattan Beach Police Officer Martin Ganz was 
only the latest in a series of incidents in recent years in which Southland 
police officers have been attacked during what appeared to be routine traffic 
stops: 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 6, 1993: Long Beach Police Officer Abel Dominguez was shot and 
critically wounded by friends of a motorist he had taken into custody in his 
patrol car. As Dominguez, who survived the attack, sat working at the car's 
computer console, two men approached the car, fired at him and fled with the 
motorist. Two suspects were later arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 9, 1993: A motorcyclist on a quiet residential street in Garden Grove 
gunned down veteran Officer Howard E. Dallies Jr., who apparently had pulled 
over the cyclist. Neighbors who heard the shots and called 911 ran outside to 
find Dallies dying after being shot several times point-blank. The fatal bullet 
lodged in his abdomen, just below his bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 22, 1993: Compton Police Officers Kevin Michael Burrell and James Wayne 
MacDonald were killed by occupants of a red pickup they had stopped. Emerging 
from the truck firing, the occupants shot both officers several times; they 
died shortly afterward in a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 4, 1993: An unidentified Anaheim motorcycle officer escaped with minor 
injuries after a motorist he had stopped rammed his car into the officer's 
motorcycle, knocking him to the ground. The officer fired several shots at the 
car, and the driver and his passenger were arrested a short time later. A San 
Pedro man was arrested in April. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 3, 1991: Two unidentified Los Angeles police officers were shot in 
North Hollywood as they tried to pull over the driver of a black sedan. Both 
officers recovered, but the driver, who turned out to be a wanted felon, died 
after the officers' return of his gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 21, 1990: Los Angeles Traffic Officer Marvin Portillo was issuing a 
ticket for an expired registration of a car in the Wilshire district when the 
owner tried to run him over. The officer jumped onto the hood of the car to 
avoid being hit and was driven wildly around the neighborhood as the driver, 
who was later arrested, tried to shake him off. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 15, 1990: An unidentified Tustin police officer was shot at by a 
motorist who leaped out of his car after the officer pulled him over, then 
scuffled with the officer before pulling out a handgun and firing. The man 
missed, and police tracked him down and arrested him a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 13, 1989: Garden Grove Police Officer Darrow Halligan escaped injury 
when a motorist he had pulled over for running a stop sign shot twice at him. 
The motorist and a companion got out of the car and fled, with the motorist 
turning around and firing at Halligan as he chased them. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 3, 1989: An unidentified Buena Park police officer suffered a broken 
collarbone and cuts when a man he had stopped for making an illegal U-turn 
jumped into the officer's patrol car and drove off, dragging the officer as the 
two wrestled for control of the car. Police arrested the 19-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 26, 1988: Wilbur Carter, a Los Angeles motorcycle officer, escaped 
injury when a motorist with an Uzi machine gun opened fire on him in midday in 
Westwood Village. Carter had attempted to pull over the motorist for a traffic 
violation in the busy commercial area when the driver suddenly spun around and 
sped away, firing as he passed the officer.  
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 9, 1988: California Highway Patrol Officer Gary Baker was shot in the 
face when he stopped a driver in Glassell Park. Baker survived after doctors 
removed a bullet that had lodged in his brain. 
</P>

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EMOTIONS 
RUN HIGH IN DEBATE ON COYOTE TRAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A meeting of the Los Angeles Board of Animal Regulation Commissioners turned 
into an emotional two-hour debate Monday about the pros and cons of a 
6-month-old ban on coyote trapping. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing attracted about 40 residents and animal rights activists, mostly 
from the San Fernando Valley, and became so highly charged that several 
speakers came close to tears.One man was escorted away by security officers 
after he accused an animal regulation officer of wrongdoing for shooting a 
coyote last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the commissioners voted to ban coyote trapping by city employees, 
partly in response to pressure from animal rights activists but also because of 
the $100,000 annual cost of the trapping program. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, increased coyote sightings, particularly in the hillside 
neighborhood, have prompted the board to review that decision. Animal 
regulation officers attribute the increase in sightings to the abundance of 
food and small wildlife, the trapping ban and the recent wildfires that drove 
coyotes into urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 One speaker, who lives in the Studio City hills, choked back tears Monday, 
saying: "My 3-year-old baby was murdered by a coyote." But as some audience 
members gasped, Marilyn Grasshoff explained that her "baby" was her pet poodle 
that was killed several months ago by a coyote near her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the board took no action during the meeting, it announced a follow-up 
meeting on Jan. 24 in Reseda, when it is likely to decide whether to continue 
the ban.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD; WOMAN WHO 
RAISED POSSIBLE KIDNAP VICTIM INTERVIEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inglewood police said Monday that they had interviewed a woman who helped 
raise a man believed to have been kidnaped as a child 17 years ago, but 
investigators would not say whether the questioning shed light on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who raised Henry Miller, 22, of Oakland was interviewed last week in 
Northern California, Sgt. Alex Perez said.He declined to say where she lived or 
divulge details about the interview, other than to say that police were 
investigating her story. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 17 years to cover. It's going to be awhile," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had yet to interview Miller, who believes he is Kevin DeWayne Portis -- 
who disappeared from an Inglewood park in 1976 while walking from his home to a 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller and members of the Portis family held a tearful meeting in Los Angeles 
last week. It was arranged after police received a telephone call from an 
Oakland woman, who had been raised with Miller and said she believed he was 
Portis. Police had yet to conclude Miller and Portis were one and the same, 
although the possibility is "pretty good," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller spent the New Year's holiday in Las Vegas with Willie Mae Ruffin of 
Hawthorne, who believes she is his real mother. That trip out of state may have 
been a violation of Miller's probation for a 1990 conviction for selling 
cocaine, but Miller will probably not be punished, said William Gengler, a 
state Corrections Department spokesman.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. COUNTY; ANTONOVICH 
BACKS PLAN FOR OFF-ROAD PARK IN GORMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of off-road vehicle enthusiasts may finally get a place to race -- 
but it could mean having to haul their bikes and buggies to the outermost 
reaches of Los Angeles County, just five miles south of the Kern County line. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowing to unrelenting political pressure and a new staff report, County 
Supervisor Michael Antonovich has shifted his crucial support for a large 
off-road park to the most remote of 57 locations considered by the county: the 
Hungry Valley off-road facility run by the state in Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich's proposal to build a $6-million facility in a portion of Hungry 
Valley known as Quail Canyon -- about an hour's drive north of the San Fernando 
Valley -- infuriated off-road enthusiasts, who had counted on him to support a 
park closer to Los Angeles.

THE PAST IS PASSED ON; AFTER YEARS IN STORAGE, NATIVE AMERICAN ARTIFACTS WILL 
GO ON DISPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of the past decade, thousands of Native American artifacts recovered 
from the Lost Village of Encino, one of the costliest archeological excavations 
in state history, have been sitting in an Orange County warehouse, freed of the 
earth after centuries, but collecting dust in obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the public soon will get its first chance to see the most significant 
pieces -- stone tools, shell beadwork and arrowheads -- when they are donated 
by a scientist to two San Fernando Valley museums, marking the resolution of a 
series of controversies that have embroiled Native Americans, archeologists and 
corporate developers since the 3,000-year-old village was accidentally 
unearthed in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The debates that have swirled around the finds have overshadowed their 
archeological importance, some scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was clearly a very important discovery for both the diversity and 
quantity of artifacts and also that so much of it was found intact," said Mark 
Raab, director of the Center for Public Archeology at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there hasn't been an extensive publication on it" in peer-reviewed 
archeological journals, he noted, the key step in establishing scientific 
worth. "Neither the scientific community nor the public really know what's 
there, so displaying some of them should help." 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologist Nancy Whitney-Desautels says she hopes to deliver the first of 
the artifacts any day now, although arrangements with the museums have not been 
finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift of about 10 pieces to the San Fernando and San Gabriel mission 
museums and the placement of other larger artifacts -- probably at a state 
museum on Ventura Boulevard near the site of the find -- comes after 
archeologist Whitney-Desautels had refused for years to hand over the pieces 
until she was paid for her work by the company that constructed an office 
building on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the settlement of a $1-million lawsuit against the developers in 
1989, and the completion of the cataloguing of most of the pieces, 
Whitney-Desautels said she is ready to part with the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never intended to keep the artifacts, but a lot happened along the way," 
she said. "It's not really anybody's fault. The village was a surprise and 
there wasn't a lot of time to prepare for everything that was coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the recent history of the prehistoric village is a thoroughly modern 
story of cultural clashes, cost overruns and slow-growth politics. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the discovery of the village was simply the solution to a 
decades-old archeological mystery. For years, archeologists had attempted to 
find the ruins of the large settlement described in a 1769 diary kept by a 
member of the expedition of Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portola. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear that the village must have been somewhere in the vicinity of Los 
Encinos State Historical Park on Ventura Boulevard, where a spring that still 
flows today would have provided water. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the efforts of several researchers, no sign of the settlement was 
found, earning it the nickname "the Lost Village of Encino." Many archeologists 
feared that urbanization might have irretrievably buried the site under streets 
and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1984, a construction crew demolishing a defunct restaurant on the 
southeast corner of Balboa and Ventura boulevards came across a few artifacts 
-- leading to discovery of increasing numbers of them, and then the skeletons 
of about 20 Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Although more than 2 million tiny pieces of artifacts and bits of human and 
animal bone were found, only a few thousand of the larger items are of 
significance, Whitney-Desautels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those are mortars and pestles, milling stones, stone bowls and 
arrowheads. The presence of Native American shell beads and Spanish glass beads 
suggests that the two groups engaged in trading before the village was 
abandoned for unknown reasons sometime in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 During the dig, scientists also found the areas where villagers cooked, 
processed hides and made beads. 
</P>
<P>
 Complying with state law that requires such finds be examined and safeguarded 
by an archeologist, First Financial Group Inc., which was building an office 
complex on the site, hired Whitney-Desautels. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, she and First Financial negotiated a fee of $10,000 to $20,000, 
but because the scope of the archeological work expanded, her excavations 
lasted nearly eight months and the price tag ballooned to $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 First Financial balked, firing Whitney-Desautels after paying her about 
$600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that real estate developers pay archeological excavation 
costs up to one-half of 1% of the site's construction budget -- rules that 
First Financial had followed. But Whitney-Desautels claimed that the developer 
had agreed to pay additional costs for the excavation and preservation of the 
artifacts and said she spent $350,000 of her own money to catalogue and 
preserve the pieces in the Newport Beach warehouse owned by her company, 
Scientific Resource Surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, she filed a lawsuit against First Financial, seeking more than $1 
million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, representatives of Native American groups were also squabbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabrielenos, Chumash and Fernandenos all claimed the village as the ancient 
dwelling place of their ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandeno leaders maintained that they had inhabited the area for centuries. 
Chumash representatives cited reports by two consulting archeologists that 
found evidence of Chumash-style burials in the village. 
</P>
<P>
 But Whitney-Desautels said the artifacts were clearly the work of the 
Gabrielenos, and the state Native American Heritage Commission declared that 
the village had probably been inhabited by Gabrielenos. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, Native American remains belong to the groups representing 
descendants of the dead, as nearly as those can be determined. So, with the 
state commission backing them, the Gabrielenos won the right to reinter the 
bones, choosing the Los Encinos park, only a half-block from the excavation 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 15, 1985, the park was closed to everyone else at dawn so a 
delegation of Gabrielenos could rebury the bones in a secret grave, its 
location known only to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy also reached Sacramento that year, when former state Sen. Alan 
Robbins introduced legislation to set aside $11 million to buy land and build a 
museum to house the artifacts. But state-hired archeologists concluded that the 
collection was insufficiently valuable to warrant its own museum, and the bill 
stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins had to settle for a $195,000 appropriation to remodel the historic 
Garnier House in the Los Encinos park to house some of the artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, when a $35-million office building was planned for land across the 
street from the Lost Village site, an unusual alliance of Native Americans and 
slow-growth suburbanites opposed it, arguing that the area could contain 
additional artifacts and human remains. 
</P>
<P>
 After the developers, Katell Capretta Partners of Gardena, paid for an 
archeological survey -- which found no significant artifacts -- the city gave 
them the go-ahead to build. 
</P>
<P>
 With that battle ended, and large building complexes now covering the 
excavation on the southeastern corner of Balboa and Ventura boulevards, and the 
northeast corner as well, attention turned back to Whitney-Desautels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although she had settled her lawsuit with First Financial in 1989 -- dividing 
ownership of the artifacts -- the pieces remained in her company's warehouse, 
still being catalogued. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until this year that the work was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is unclear where the majority of the artifacts will be placed, 
many who have been involved in the protracted battle believe that the displays 
at the two museums will focus attention on the people who inhabited the area 
long ago -- and still do. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think that there aren't Indians in the San Fernando Valley 
anymore," said Rudy Ortega, a Fernandeno leader. "But I have 12 children, 69 
grandchildren and either 44 or 49 great-grandchildren. . . . Maybe by 
displaying these artifacts, we will remind people that we have been here a long 
time and plan to stay here."

SAN FERNANDO COUNCIL WEIGHS ALLEGATIONS AGAINST PARKS CHIEF; INVESTIGATION: 
JESS MARGARITO IS ACCUSED OF MISAPPROPRIATING MORE THAN $2,000 AND FALSIFYING 
OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. HE SAYS HE IS THE TARGET OF A VENDETTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando City Council on Monday night considered in secret what steps 
to take in the case of parks Director Jess Margarito, a popular former mayor 
accused of falsifying official documents and misappropriating more than $2,000 
in city funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came just hours after Margarito -- also the target of a separate 
criminal investigation by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office -- 
lambasted the council for engaging in what he called a political vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, meeting in a confidential executive session, heard a report by 
San Fernando Police Lt. Ernie Halcon, according to members of the council. The 
meeting continued late into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Halcon and an investigator from the district attorney's office 
seized a computer and records from Margarito's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito has been the subject of a criminal investigation by the district 
attorney's office since April and has been under scrutiny by the council since 
October. The council inquiry was limited to administrative matters, although 
Halcon has said he found evidence of alleged criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigations are based on allegations that Margarito falsified work 
cards for convicts assigned by courts to work in the city's parks, and 
submitted bogus work orders that resulted in the payment of $2,250 for tasks 
not done. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office has been investigating Margarito since April, 
while the San Fernando City Council directed the city's Police Department to 
look into the charges in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Monday, Margarito told a gathering in front of the San Fernando police 
station that the inquiries were politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're doing to us is unjust," he said. "We're not going to be 
intimidated or cowed down by people who don't want change to take place." 
</P>
<P>
 The small rally attracted about 35 residents, many of whom have known 
Margarito since he began his rise from U.S. Census Bureau worker to councilman 
in 1984 and mayor in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito did not contradict allegations outlined last week in a search 
warrant affidavit, but said the investigations are an excessive reaction to 
what he believes are merely record-keeping irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 He promised to produce evidence in the coming weeks and called for a public 
City Council meeting to air the allegations. The council has met several times 
in closed session to discuss the case on the grounds that it is a personnel 
matter.

BATTLE OVER JUNKING BOTTLE VILLAGE; LANDMARK: THE ONE-ACRE CREATION IN SIMI 
VALLEY MUST SOON COMPLY WITH NEW CODES -- OR FACE DEMOLITION. SOME TRY TO 
PRESERVE IT, WHILE OTHERS CALL IT AN EYESORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Each day, Janice Wilson breezes down a typical Simi Valley street, past rows 
of look-alike houses, to a ramshackle one-acre fantasy land. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There, beneath a dozen drooping eucalyptus trees, Wilson tends to a collection 
of miniature trees dripping with toothbrushes, buildings made of bottles, and 
gardens sprouting doll heads and bedsprings. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years, Wilson has shouldered the task of caring for Bottle Village, 
a whimsical collection of 13 child-sized buildings and sculptures made almost 
entirely of junk. 
</P>
<P>
 To Wilson, the village is an inspiring creation worth preserving. But to many 
of the village's neighbors, it's an eyesore they would rather see destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-acre village was created by Tressa Prisbrey three decades ago and has 
been internationally recognized as a valuable work of folk art. It has been 
closed to the public for 11 years because of unsafe conditions -- roofs leak, 
walls crumble, and the toothbrush trees and doll heads wither and rot at the 
whim of sun, wind and rain. 
</P>
<P>
 There have long been plans to restore the deteriorating structures, but a lack 
of community interest has left the landmark to limp along under the care of a 
few die-hard supporters who call themselves the Preserve Bottle Village 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in order to comply with an ordinance passed several years ago, the 
committee must supply the city of Simi Valley with a plan by June to make the 
village earthquake-proof, or face demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the chances of the village being torn down are slim -- 
supporters can always ask for an extension -- but Wilson says the committee 
cannot afford to hire an engineer to conduct the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to boost local interest in the village, Wilson has launched two 
projects: an educational video about the village and a grant-funded reprinting 
of a booklet by Prisbrey, known as "Grandma" Prisbrey, offering a lively 
introduction to the village. 
</P>
<P>
 "A collection of bottles, all shapes and sizes, started to find their way to 
my front yard," Prisbrey wrote. "Putting them together in a heap invited me to 
do something with them . . . thus began Bottle Village." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said she plans to distribute the booklet and video to schools 
throughout the city, with the hope that they will be incorporated into lessons 
on local history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children in particular really love Bottle Village," said Wilson, who said 
Prisbrey's work inspired her to use junk in her own art. "They like the colors 
and all the neat things Grandma collected." 
</P>
<P>
 Prisbrey began building the village around her trailer home in 1955, 
continuing to work on it for almost two decades. The project began as a simple 
plan to build a storage space for the 2,000 pencils she had collected from 
store giveaways and political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 In search of bricks, she visited a dump and discovered a wealth of the Milk of 
Magnesia and beer bottles that were to become the building blocks for the 
village. 
</P>
<P>
 When the pencil house was completed, Prisbrey continued to visit the dump. 
Each day, she filled her Studebaker truck with old tires, headlights and 
television tubes, which wound up as parts of rooms and sculptures with quirky 
names such as Rumpus Room, Cleopatra's Bedroom, the Leaning Tower of Bottle 
Village and the Round House. 
</P>
<P>
 The village was designated a historic landmark by the state and Ventura 
County, and was awarded a plaque of recognition by the Folk Art Society of 
America.

SUSPICIOUS TANKER CARS TO BE SEARCHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigation: Customs officials will inspect the train after workers finish 
emptying propane gas fumes. Inspectors suspect they hold drugs or contraband. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators today plan to search two rail cars suspected of carrying 
drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border after workers finish emptying gas fumes 
from the propane tanker cars at a San Bernardino County rail yard, authorities 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Southern Pacific Railroad said U.S. Customs inspectors would 
begin the search at 10 a.m. Officials said they were still bleeding fumes from 
the tanker cars Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no further indication whether the 20,000-gallon tanker cars, used 
for hauling liquid propane fuel to Mexico, contain drugs or other illicit 
goods. Officials are not aware of any previous incident of trains being used by 
smugglers at the California border. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars were part of a Southern Pacific Railroad freight train stopped by 
customs inspectors last week. Inspectors at the Calexico border crossing 
determined Thursday that the cars were suspiciously overweight, officials said. 
But for reasons that remain unclear, the train got as far as the Colton area. 
</P>
<P>
 The process of purging the tankers was delayed by the holiday, said Southern 
Pacific spokesman Mike Furteney. He said the train's destination was a town 
near Amarillo, Tex., and that the owner of the rail cars and the fuel provider 
are U.S. companies.

 RECALLING ROMERO: Emil Sitka of Camarillo played the foil in countless 
episodes of "The Three Stooges."But when he wasn't taking a pie in the face, 
Sitka worked with more serious actors, including Cesar Romero, who died 
Saturday. . . . "He loved being a star," said Sitka, who worked with Romero and 
Betty Grable on "The Beautiful Blonde From Bashful Bend" in 1949. "He really 
liked the party circuit.". . . At 78, Sitka doesn't party much himself anymore, 
but he may attend a Stooge-lovers convention in Philadelphia this summer. "I 
still get fan mail." Gary Gorman

 LATE-NIGHT SHOPS COULD WAKE UP TO NEW CONTROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doughnut shops, pizza places and fast-food restaurants face new regulation if 
they stay open after midnight and operate near residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to complaints about noise, crime and nuisances at several all-night 
businesses, the City Council on a unanimous vote tentatively approved an 
ordinance Monday giving the city more control of what stays open from midnight 
until early morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, owners of late-night or early-morning cafes, drive-ins 
and shops that are 150 feet or less from a residence must apply for a 
conditional-use permit. Officials who consider those applications will review 
crime statistics for that area and may require owners to hire security 
officers, improve lighting or meet other conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's planning commission can also require the business owner to close 
earlier or open later under terms of the permit. Owners can appeal those orders 
to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen doughnut shops, 21 taco stands and Mexican restaurants, and 19 other 
fast-food stores are open between midnight and 5 a.m., according to a police 
survey. It did not determine how many are within 150 feet of a home. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue, said Robyn Uptegraff, executive director of the Planning and 
Building Agency, are problems that disrupt residents' daily life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had complaints over the years from people who live next to a fast-food 
drive-in, for example," Uptegraff said. "Maybe (the restaurant) used to be open 
until midnight, and now they're open until 2 in the morning. Or their speaker 
used for ordering food wasn't placed in an appropriate location, or headlights 
from traffic are shining into homes late at night." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, late-night businesses "become meeting places for large numbers of 
people," Uptegraff said, "and in some cases there are crime problems relating 
to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Alberta Christy, head of the Valley High neighborhood association, said she 
supports the ordinance, which would affect a dozen stores in her area. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who'd normally visit these a couple of years ago are intimidated by 
fear," Christy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop owners were notified by mail of the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 Hay Ith, owner of Luv'n Donuts at 3605 S. Bristol St., said that her store and 
the small shops around it are quiet and that she is confused about the permit 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why the city is doing this," said Ith, who has owned the shop 
for 14 years. Her store closes at 10 p.m., but she was told hers was on the 
list of late-night restaurants because she opens at 4 a.m. -- one hour before 
the 5 a.m. limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't open the store later," Ith said. "People want to come in early to get 
fresh doughnuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucia Salinas, of Taquerias Guadalajara, told the City Council on Monday night 
that the action "could really affect us." 
</P>
<P>
 "To pay our bills we need to be open all night, 24 hours," said Salinas, who 
added that the restaurant has removed public telephones and installed video 
cameras to deter crime. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council member Robert Richardson said Taquerias Guadalajara and similar 
businesses that have done "a good job in presenting a positive image . . . have 
nothing to worry about" and will probably receive permits. 
</P>
<P>
 But Legal Aid attorney Harry Simon said he believes the plan is an effort to 
drive some people from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's idea is that 'decent' citizens should be off the streets between 
those hours," said Simon, who represents several homeless people in an ongoing 
lawsuit against the city. "It makes our clients' lives more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance will go into effect Feb. 16 if approved on its second reading at 
the next City Council meeting. Owners of existing shops will have two years to 
file applications without charge, but new owners must apply for permits 
immediately and pay all required fees.

BASKETBALL PLAYER SUES OVER FLAGRANT FOUL; SPORTS: FORMER GOLDEN WEST COLLEGE 
STAR SAYS SHE IS SEEKING $1 MILLION BECAUSE AN OPPOSING PLAYER SHOVED HER INTO 
A WALL AND ENDED HER ATHLETIC CAREER. 
</P>

<P>
 After two seasons at shooting guard for the Golden West Rustlers, the moment 
Erika Miller dreamed about had finally arrived. She and her teammates were on 
their way to the California Community College women's basketball tournament in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Miller hoped she would get a chance to showcase her talent for scouts 
from four-year colleges and universities who held out the prospect of an 
athletic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Feb. 24, 1993, in a playoff game against Antelope Valley Community 
College just a week before the tournament, Miller saw her aspirations dashed. 
Literally. 
</P>
<P>
 As she went airborne to attempt a breakaway layup, an Antelope Valley player 
shoved her, slamming her into a wall under the basket. Miller was taken to a 
hospital with a dislocated left elbow, an injury that ended her career. The 
player, Niani Dunn, was ejected from the game for a flagrant foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Miller, a former all-star basketball player at Edison High School here, is 
taking legal action. She filed a lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court last 
week seeking $1 million in damages from Dunn, Antelope Valley Community College 
and the college's women's basketball coach, Jackie Lott. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like part of my life has been taken away from me," the 20-year-old 
Huntington Beach woman said Monday. "No money can make up for the pain I've 
gone through, but I kind of feel like I've lost my future." 
</P>
<P>
 Local basketball coaches describe the action as unusual, saying they cannot 
remember any lawsuits involving on-court activities. But legal action, even 
criminal prosecution, for deliberate acts of violence in sports is not entirely 
unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Dino Ciccarelli of the Minnesota North Stars was sentenced to a day 
in jail for striking Luke Richardson of the Toronto Maple Leafs with his hockey 
stick on the head twice. A handful of other hockey players have also been 
charged over the last three decades after attacking competitors with their 
sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miller's case, school officials did not call the police, but then-Athletic 
Director Tom Hermstad fired off a letter to his counterpart at Antelope Valley 
to ask whether any action had been taken against Dunn and Lott. 
</P>
<P>
 After the foul was committed, Lott was not concerned that Miller was sprawled 
on the floor -- in pain, Hermstad wrote. He said the opposing coach screamed at 
the referees, " 'How could you throw (Niani Dunn) out of the game? We are 
already down X amount of points. How do we get back in the game?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Brandige, vice president of Antelope Valley Community College, declined on 
Monday to discuss the lawsuit or the contents of Hermstad's letter. The school 
also did not reply to Hermstad's correspondence because of the potential for 
litigation. Dunn and Lott could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this does not sound sexist, but if that was a men's game, I expect 
that there would have been a brawl," said Hermstad, who is now vice president 
of instruction at Golden West College. "(Dunn) made no attempt to play the 
ball. If there was ever a word for brutal, that foul typified it." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Stricklin, the Rustlers' basketball coach, said the foul probably cost 
Golden West the state championship because the team lost Miller, a three-point 
specialist who was averaging 12.3 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be concerned if something like that happened to my daughter," 
Stricklin said. "I've seen people sue for situations that were a lot less 
violent." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's attorney, Susan Cameron Kelley of Huntington Beach, said her client's 
damage claim was routinely denied by the Antelope Valley School District last 
year. Kelley said she was almost certain that Miller would prevail in her 
lawsuit, noting that she had obtained a videotape showing the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "That foul was battery," Kelley asserted. "It's not what people agree to do 
when they step on a basketball court." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a devoted Magic Johnson and Lakers fan, said she is not trying to set 
a precedent by making money from a flagrant foul, but merely seeking some 
compensation for her injuries and ruined athletic career. 
</P>
<P>
 She recalled the cast she wore for seven weeks, her loss of earnings as a 
waitress and the extreme disappointment of never being able to step on a 
basketball court again because of continuing pain in her elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 "No amount of money could pay for what I've been through," Miller said. "The 
bottom line is she was trying to hurt me, and that's not in the game."

TAPE SURFACES IN SHOOTING OF DEPUTY; INQUIRY: THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS 
REVIEWING VIDEO FOOTAGE, BUT THE CAMERA DID NOT CATCH THE FATAL INCIDENT, 
SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The district attorney's office is reviewing videotape from a camera mounted on 
a patrol car when an Orange County sheriff's deputy was fatally shot on 
Christmas, but the tape has no footage of the shooting itself, sources said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Disclosure of the tape's existence could raise more questions than it answers, 
however, as investigators piece together the chronology of events leading to 
the shooting of Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins, 30, by a fellow deputy. The 
shooting occurred during what was described as an impromptu afternoon training 
session in a mall parking lot behind a Lake Forest movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among the questions is why the camera failed to capture the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 One law-enforcement source said the camera -- installed under a new sheriff's 
program to provide conclusive evidence in disputed cases -- appears to have 
been rolling during the shooting but was not aimed properly out the front 
window. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are investigating the possibility that a deputy may have 
accidentally knocked the camera from its normal angle during a burglary 
investigation at the Twin Peaks shopping plaza in Lake Forest, just minutes 
before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had that camera been raised up," a source said, "it probably would have 
filmed the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates confirmed the existence of the videotape 
Monday but said he did not know what it showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Dan Martini said the tapes "are in the hands of the 
district attorney, but I can't tell you if there's anything on the tapes or 
not. I don't know what's on them." 
</P>
<P>
 District attorney's officials declined to discuss the videotape issue. The 
office is investigating the case to determine whether criminal charges are 
warranted against Deputy Brian Scanlan, 32, a field training officer who shot 
Robins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department began installing the video cameras in mid-1992 from 
the rearview mirrors of each of its 125 patrol cars. The fist-sized cameras can 
be activated manually or automatically when the car's emergency lights or 
sirens are turned on. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies can also adjust the direction of the camera, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by the videotaped beating of Rodney G. King by Los Angeles police, the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors approved spending more than $540,000 on the 
program in two phases. It marked the first time in the nation that a 
law-enforcement agency had agreed to put video cameras in its entire fleet of 
patrol vehicles, experts in the field said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cameras provided "a third, disinterested, objective eye" in the patrol 
cars, sheriff's officials said. They were designed to provide footage in 
pursuits, traffic stops, arrests and other run-ins between police and suspected 
lawbreakers that might later come into legal dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Robins case, the camera offered the prospect of direct evidence in 
an incident between two deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have said that Robins and Scanlan were running through a "hot car" 
stop to review apprehension procedures when the shooting happened. 
Investigators are focusing on the possibility that Robins, playing the part of 
the suspect in the car, surprised Scanlan by reaching for a gun from the car 
visor and that Scanlan then shot him in the face.  
</P>
<P>
 Still unanswered is the question of why Scanlan was training at a public lot 
with a loaded weapon -- in apparent violation of department policies at most 
local police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two sheriff's vehicles were in the lot at 2 p.m. Dec. 25 when Robins 
was shot. Officials did not say Monday when the tapes now being reviewed by the 
district attorney's office began rolling or where the car that held the camera 
was positioned in relation to Robins. 
</P>
<P>
 One source said he had not viewed the videotape but understood that the camera 
had been aimed toward the dashboard. It did not capture any images of the 
shooting itself, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotaping equipment also can provide audio sound through wireless 
microphones worn by the deputies. But officials said the audio is not 
automatically activated along with the video, and it is unclear whether any 
sound was recorded that may prove of use in the district attorney's 
investigation. The probe is expected to last several more weeks.

REBIRTH FOR LAGUNA SCHOOL; ONCE-INNOVATIVE BUILDINGS DESTROYED BY INFERNO HAD 
BECOME OUTDATED 
</P>

<P>
 When Thurston Middle School opened in the late 1960s, educators from around 
the world came to visit what was called one of the most innovative schools of 
its time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the spirit of that era, Thurston students created their own schedules each 
morning, picking from a list of class offerings organized weekly by teachers 
using an IBM computer known as "Big Al," a computer that had never been used by 
a school before. 
</P>
<P>
 Such flexible scheduling called for flexible buildings. As a consequence, 
there were movable walls inside the campus buildings, allowing teachers to 
create large or small settings at will. 
</P>
<P>
 But as educational theories changed, and school board members and 
administrators came and went, Thurston underwent a transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1970s, students shifted to a more standard schedule, attending the 
same six or seven classes each day. Permanent walls were added where none 
existed. 
</P>
<P>
 And what time did not change, fire recently did, giving educators the chance 
to rebuild the heart of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's main academic building, with 14 classrooms housing every subject 
except science, was destroyed in the Oct. 27 firestorm that swept through 
Laguna Beach, taking 366 homes and causing more than $400 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 545-student campus, which sits on a Park Avenue knoll with expansive 
views of the Pacific Ocean and Catalina Island, the damage was estimated at 
more than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge of rebuilding the heart of the school may be born of disaster, 
but Laguna Beach Unified School District officials are taking advantage of the 
unexpected opportunity to meet the modern needs of the school, which have 
changed so much since it opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a good opportunity here to create an environment that supports the 
kind of teaching and learning environment we believe in," Principal Cheryl 
Baughn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board recently hired a Newport Beach architectural firm, Blurock 
Partnership, and a school committee is considering three main rebuilding 
options, two of which call for new designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Several teachers have said they would like to start with more traditionally 
styled classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of walls in the old building in the 1970s created odd-shaped 
rooms, many without windows or doors to the outside. Some rooms also had poor 
ventilation, and were either too hot or too cold, depending on the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want something that meets our needs and looks toward the 21st Century," 
said Terry A. Bustillos, chief financial officer for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Thurston Intermediate School, which was named after the first 
schoolteacher in Laguna Beach, opened in 1968 and was hailed in numerous 
newspapers, magazines and journals as a school ahead of its time, both in 
academics and architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only intermediate school in the nation with a total program of team 
teaching and what was known as "flexible daily demand scheduling." 
</P>
<P>
 One newspaper described the system as a "second campus revolution," not to be 
confused with the "antics of student activists" making headlines at other 
campuses, the writer expounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Another article told how the school was moving away from "classroom boxes" to 
a program where, in the words of founding Principal David Lloyd, "the student 
is king." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's 450 students in the seventh and eighth grades moved through their 
subjects grouped by ability, not grade level. They divided their days into 26 
"modules" of 15 minutes each for both required and elective subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States Office of Education was so impressed that it brought 
educators from home and abroad to visit the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurston computer and math teacher Wick Lobo, who ran the scheduling computer, 
said the early years at Thurston were the most exciting of his professional 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a nice way to start," said Lobo, a teacher since 1961 who lost his 
classroom in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the system had its flaws, Lobo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduling demands could be overwhelming, and some students found ways to get 
around the system, signing themselves up for lots of free time and other 
activities rather than required basic subjects. Some failed to sign up for 
classes at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you couldn't ask for a better system for those who were reliant and 
responsible," Lobo said. 
</P>
<P>
 English teacher Gail McClain, who started her career at Thurston in 1968, said 
she was sorry to see the end of flexible scheduling, although she realizes it 
had its problems and was expensive to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was supposed to be a very student-centered approach to education, really 
allowing students to feel like they had some control of their environment," 
said McClain, whose classroom also was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the students who thrived under the flexible scheduling system was Marla 
McKeown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved it," said McKeown, who now teaches at the school. "I was one of those 
students who liked to be challenged and see how far I could go in my classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the remaining campus buildings, including the science wing and 
library, there's little left of the old Thurston system. 
</P>
<P>
 But teachers say innovation, in such forms as technology and hands-on 
activities, still lives inside the classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 And out of the disaster now comes new opportunities, said McClain, a member of 
the reconstruction committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really an opportunity to do some real good things," she said, "and be 
as innovative now as we were back then."

SCOTT HARRIS: A CYNICAL '93, BUT WAS VERDICT GUILTY?; AND SO I OFFER WILL'S 
ERROR AS EVIDENCE THAT 1993, FOR ALL ITS TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS, REALLY WASN'T 
AS BAD AS YOU THOUGHT.

 A Los Angeles jury decided that smashing Reginald Denny's skull with a brick 
did not constitute assault with a deadly weapon . . . -- Columnist George Will 
in Newsweek, Dec. 17, 1993 Outrageous, isn't it? You saw the video. You saw 
Damian Williams heave the brick that smashed Reginald Denny's skull. You saw 
Williams' little victory dance. And now the estimable George Will, reviewing 
1993 with a deadpan delivery of facts and observations, reminds us that an 
infamous jury amazingly concluded Williams was innocent of assault with a 
deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 But hold on a second. Before you get mad all over again, remember you 
shouldn't believe everything you read. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, George Will didn't get his facts straight. 
</P>
<P>
 You know George. If you don't read Newsweek, you've seen him on "This Week 
With David Brinkley." A button-down conservative. A big Orioles fan. He's the 
WASPiest, nerdiest pundit in Washington -- and one of the best. You may or may 
not agree with his opinions, but it's hard not to respect his thinking and his 
prose. 
</P>
<P>
 So it may be telling that Will would botch a routine fact in a column titled 
"1993: Nature's Hysterics, and More." 
</P>
<P>
 His mistake is a common one and, no doubt, an honest one. But it may reveal 
how Will and others angry with the Williams verdict aren't immune from 
hysterics themselves. And so I offer Will's error as evidence that 1993, for 
all its trials and tribulations, really wasn't as bad as you thought. 
</P>
<P>
 George, please pay attention: The Williams jury did not decide that smashing 
Denny's skull with a brick wasn't assault with a deadly weapon -- or ADW, as 
the cops call it. The jury decided that Williams' felonious assault, as 
horrible as it was, did not constitute either attempted murder or aggravated 
mayhem (maiming). The jury found him guilty of the lesser felony of mayhem, as 
well as four misdemeanor counts of assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is huge. 
</P>
<P>
 ADW, in and of itself, isn't a big-time felony. The maximum prison term is 
four years. By contrast, the maximum sentence for attempted murder or 
aggravated mayhem is life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams wasn't charged with ADW in the Denny beating, prosecutors explain, 
because he faced far more serious charges. Under sentencing rules, prosecutors 
say, a charge of ADW would have been pointless. As it was, the much-maligned 
jury convicted Williams of crimes that enabled Judge John W. Ouderkirk to 
impose a 10-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 This may seem like nit-picking. After all, confusing ADW with attempted murder 
is easy to do. Moreover, in the attacks on four other individuals, Williams was 
indeed acquitted of ADW in favor of misdemeanor assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Will's mistake will reach millions of readers, perpetuating the 
notion that the Williams jury had no logical basis for its ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics who found the Williams verdict too lenient offer it as a be-all, 
end-all symbol of what's wrong with America. Race relations are a mess and the 
criminal justice system is a joke, they say. These are certainly great sources 
of consternation. 
</P>
<P>
 In this climate, Will's error should be seen as a symptom of cynicism -- a 
favorite pastime after the Denny verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 The misconception has been popularized in a clever but inaccurate political 
cartoon by Randy Wicks of the Newhall Signal. Wick's work, which has been 
reproduced on T-shirts, depicts three "Assault Weapons in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The word "Mean" appears above the image of a bloody knife. "Meaner" appears 
above a smoking gun. Above the bloody brick is the punch line: "Misdemeanor." 
</P>
<P>
 It's pretty funny, but the fact remains that Williams' brick was implicated in 
a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Political cartoonists engage in parody, so Wicks probably knows better. Will's 
intent is serious, not satiric. However, had Will substituted the words 
attempted murder for assault with a deadly weapon , the statement would not 
seem so mind-boggling; after all, intent is hard to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 For all their inaccuracies, Wicks' cartoon and Will's column accurately 
reflected the public mood of outrage. Expectations of an attempted murder 
conviction left an angry public saying Williams was "getting off." Long before 
Will's column appeared, I talked with three people who also confused ADW with 
attempted murder. Two were white, one was black. All were outraged that 
Williams didn't get hammered with the maximum penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The point isn't whether Williams' punishment fits his crime, but whether the 
jury had reasonable grounds for its verdict.  
</P>
<P>
 The story is rich with irony. It is ironic that the video that so angered us 
evidently persuaded 12 citizens that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether 
Williams intended to kill or permanently disfigure his victim. If that was his 
intent, why didn't Williams continue his violent attack rather than do his 
nasty jig? The video that nailed Williams as one of the culprits, it seems, 
supported the lower mayhem charge. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also ironic that the good Samaritans who saved Denny's life saved 
Williams' bacon. Had they not arrived, Williams likely would have faced a 
murder charge -- a point prosecutors made often. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny's survival didn't help the case against Williams. To the contrary, 
Denny's decision to hug the mothers of Williams and co-defendant Henry Watson 
may have helped put the jury in a more lenient frame of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 So you can look at 1993 a couple of ways. Perhaps it left a bitter taste. But 
if you tend to remember the smirk of Damian Williams, don't forget the 
forgiving embrace of Reginald Denny. 
</P>
<P>
 The brick was '92; the hug was '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's to the hope for a better '94.

CAMARILLO COUPLE WINS $6-MILLION LOTTO JACKPOT; LOTTERY: IT IS THE 
FIFTH-LARGEST JACKPOT IN VENTURA COUNTY. THE TWO WINNERS WANT TO 'KEEP THINGS 
AS NORMAL AS POSSIBLE.'

 For Laura and Brad Young of Camarillo sudden wealth was taken in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners of Saturday's $6.78-million California Lottery, the Youngs say you 
won't catch them at foreign car dealerships or fur shops. Their goal is to stay 
the same comfortable, middle-class family despite their new-found millions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't very well fit a baby seat in a Porsche, can you?" quipped Brad 
Young, a 34-year-old TWA pilot, during a Monday press conference in Ventura. 
"Our goal is try and keep things as normal as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting with 2-year-old daughter Kelsey, the Youngs -- winners of the 
fifth-largest lottery jackpot in county history -- calmly fielded questions 
despite the glare of cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably quit my job, but that's the biggest change that we'll make," 
said Laura Young, 31, an employee of a Camarillo property management firm and 
an expectant mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll buy a minivan, and maybe we'll set up some trust funds for our 
kids and friends' kids educations. Most of it will be carefully socked away 
though," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Young bought the winning ticket Thursday at the Daily Drive Sav-on 
store. Both she and her husband are infrequent players and relied on pure 
chance by asking the lottery's "quick pick" computer to select their winning 
numbers -- 20, 22, 26, 29, 35 and 49. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought the ticket and then forgot about it until Sunday," she said. After a 
quick trip to the store, she checked. "I told Brad and he didn't believe me at 
first. He kept checking and rechecking the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Stephen Freund, district manager for the lottery, the Youngs will 
receive annual checks of $244,080 after taxes for the next 20 years. They will 
get their first one in three weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Freund said he was impressed by the couple's calm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was more nervous than they were," Freund said. "They just won more 
than $6 million, and they're treating it like it was $6. These people are 
really grounded, well-rounded folks." 
</P>
<P>
 John Jensen, a manager at Sav-on, said he could not believe that fortune had 
struck when he checked lottery numbers Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put their ticket in the machine. It burped and gurgled and came back 
verifying all six numbers," Jensen said. "They promised me a dinner out with 
them soon. It couldn't have happened to nicer people." 
</P>
<P>
 For selling the Youngs a single $5 ticket, the drug store gets $33,099, Freund 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Laura and Brad Young are from middle-class backgrounds, she said. He 
graduated from San Jose State University with a degree in aeronautics. She 
graduated from Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both are pilots. She got her license in 1988. He trained privately in Orange 
County and is now a first officer for TWA and a captain in the Air National 
Guard's Channel Islands 146th Tactical Airlift Wing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Youngs hinted that they might allow themselves one indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we have to rent aircraft," she said. "Maybe someday we'll buy 
ourselves a plane."

GASH FOUND IN AGING PIPELINE NEAR THE SITE OF MCGRATH SPILL; INVESTIGATION: 
OFFICIALS SAY DISCOVERING THE 18-INCH SEAM TEAR BRINGS THEM NO CLOSER TO 
PINPOINTING THE CAUSE OF THE 84,000-GALLON OIL LEAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Crewmen looking for the source of a massive oil spill that leaked 84,000 
gallons of heavy crude into McGrath Lake and the ocean found an 18-inch gash 
Monday in the seam of an aging pipeline buried beneath a Harbor Boulevard 
broccoli patch. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators discovered the lengthy tear in the oil line about 20 feet 
east of Harbor Boulevard -- across the street from where thick globs of crude 
oil had accumulated before the pipeline was shut off Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-foot section of the ruptured pipeline was sawed off, cleaned up and 
transported to the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. It will remain there 
until state officials choose which laboratory will perform metallurgical tests 
to be done on the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite finding the exact site where the eight-inch pipeline had broken, 
Bush Oil Co. and state officials said they are no closer to figuring out why 
the leak occurred in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for Berry Petroleum of Taft, which owns Bush Oil, also on Monday 
were unable to explain how their employees failed to notice that 84,000 gallons 
of heavy crude did not make it to their storage tank for three days. 
</P>
<P>
 They said earlier that the ruptured pipeline normally carried 600 barrels of 
oil a day and that 2,000 barrels of crude had leaked. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the metallurgical tests will take weeks or months to determine, 
said Robert Gorham, an engineer with the state Fire Marshal's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll be looking for the type of pipe, the width, what the strength of the 
pipe is . . . to pinpoint what type of failure it is," Gorham said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile on Monday, traffic was backed up along Victoria Avenue, Olivas Park 
Drive and Gonzales Road leading from the Harbor Boulevard excavation site after 
work crews closed off the street, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup officials received permission to close the road at noon Monday after 
workers excavating the underground pipe complained that the traffic created a 
safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor Boulevard will be closed again today and Wednesday between Olivas Park 
Drive and Gonzales Road from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have to decontaminate and clean up the area down there," said 
Raymond Hatch, a Berry Petroleum spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 A state Department of Fish and Game official said he is satisfied that the 
rupture found on Monday is the only gash in the aging pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we are concerned, this rupture is the sole cause of the leak," said 
Fish and Game spokesman David Blurton, who said there is no early indication of 
what may have caused the rupture. 
</P>
<P>
 Blurton said his office would not require Bush Oil to remove the rest of the 
pipeline, but Hatch said late Monday that he expects the oil company to drag 
the pipe from underneath Harbor Boulevard anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to take out the line under the road," Hatch said. "It's going to 
be pressure-tested to make sure there are no more leaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch said the company has not yet decided when or if the line would be 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of gallons of thick crude oil spilled into the ditch when workers 
uncovered the 18-inch casing that surrounds the pipeline. Much of it was 
vacuumed up by late Monday, but workers also used more than 100 cubic feet of 
an organic industrial absorbent to soak up the oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Large pools of crude oil were visible in the brush on the west side of Harbor 
Boulevard, where workers had toiled since Sunday to clear an area big enough 
for cleanup crews to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no change reported Monday in the number of migratory and shore birds 
that have died since the spill, which is Ventura County's worst pipeline break 
in decades. Officials said Monday that 138 birds have died so far and another 
28 oil-tarred birds are near death. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Dec. 30 report from the city of Oxnard, 80% of McGrath Lake -- 
the area where the bulk of the 84,000 gallons of oil was found -- is inside 
city limits. Community Development Director Richard Maggio outlined the spill 
and cleanup effort as part of a weekly briefing to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was issued after some early confusion about which law enforcement 
agency was responsible for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At least six public agencies -- including the Oxnard Police Department -- 
received reports about leaking oil a full day before a federal officials saw 
offshore oil slicks Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know which particular map the dispatchers were using at the time, but 
I can certainly see the confusion," Oxnard City Manager Thomas Frutchey said. 
"You've got to have a pretty accurate map to determine boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt said Monday that his department could have 
used more detailed information when his dispatcher first heard the oil spill 
report on Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had more knowledge as to the exact location and we thought it was in 
our area of responsibility, we would respond to it," he said. "The best way to 
make sure is if it's close to the city, we'll make the call."

LAW GIVES CITIES A VOICE IN COUNTY AIR QUALITY ISSUES; ENVIRONMENT: THE BOARD 
OF SUPERVISORS, WHICH CURRENTLY HEADS THE POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT, IS 
SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS THE MATTER TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under a new state law, cities in Ventura County will have a say for the first 
time in setting county policies intended to reduce air pollution and comply 
with state and federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
 All five county supervisors now make up the local Air Pollution Control 
District board. But by July 1, the county must add at least one elected 
representative from among the county's 10 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 If county and city leaders cannot agree on the new composition of the board 
before July, the law requires that the board be made up of an equal number of 
county and city leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Board of Supervisors is scheduled to take up the issue at its 
regular board meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard H. Baldwin, the county's top air pollution official, said the July 1 
deadline comes at a crucial time. By November, the county must adopt a 
far-reaching plan to reduce pollution emissions and must come into compliance 
with federal air quality standards by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to figure out who the new board is so I can begin the education 
process as early as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Susan K. Lacey wrote a letter to fellow supervisors Dec. 14 laying 
out several options for adding city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The options range from a five-member board with three supervisors and two city 
officials to a 15-member board with five supervisors and an elected official 
from each city. 
</P>
<P>
 But a group of elected city officials from throughout the county has written a 
letter to the Board of Supervisors suggesting that the Ventura County 
Organization of Governments become the new Air Pollution Control District 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, signed by Ventura City Councilman Greg Carson, described air 
quality as "one of the most pressing issues for each . . . government in the 
county." 
</P>
<P>
 But Baldwin said that regional group cannot legally become the new board 
because it includes members from two cities in Los Angeles County -- Agoura and 
Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn said he favors adding just one or two city officials 
and continuing to hold the Air Pollution Control District meetings on Tuesdays 
when the Board of Supervisors meets. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one from any city has ever called me up and said, 'John, we want to get on 
the APCD board,' " Flynn said. "It takes a long time to get up to speed on APCD 
issues and cities have never paid much attention to it." 
</P>
<P>
 If more than one or two city officials are added, he said, it will require 
separate meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to add a cost to doing the business," Flynn said. "And it won't 
improve the air one bit. It's a stupid piece of legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which was passed in October, was sponsored by Assemblyman Dan Hauser 
(D-Arcata.) 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne Hunter, a lobbyist for the League of California Cities, said cities 
pushed for the legislation because they wanted more of a say in emission and 
land-use restrictions that could by imposed by counties to reduce air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it better to have them at the table instead of pounding on the door 
outside, wanting to get in?" Hunter asked.

OFFICIALS HALT EXCAVATION AT POSSIBLE CHUMASH SITE; REMAINS: DEPUTY CORONER 
SAYS TOOTH, BONE FRAGMENTS FOUND NEAR CAMARILLO MAY BE OF HUMAN ORIGIN. 
ARCHEOLOGICAL WORK BEGAN AFTER ROAD BUILDERS MADE DISCOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County coroner's officials have told archeologists to cease excavation 
of a site near Camarillo that may contain an ancient Chumash burial ground 
after investigators determined that a tooth and other bone fragments found 
there may be of human origin. 
</P>
<P>
 The stop-work order was issued Sunday after Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens 
examined the tooth and other bone fragments discovered at the site last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We confirmed the possibility that what was found there may be a human tooth, 
bone fragments. They were inside what looked to be some sort of cremation urn," 
Stevens said. "After examining the site, we believe that there was enough 
evidence to issue the cease-work order." 
</P>
<P>
 The archeological work began after county road builders uncovered the possible 
Chumash site on Dec. 22, near where Santa Rosa Road is being widened. When 
Stevens determined that the site may contain human remains, he called the 
California Native American Heritage Commission in Sacramento and informed 
officials there of the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission officials said that in accordance with state law, they called 
county public works officials and gave them the name of a woman deemed likely 
to be a descendant of the deceased person. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission officials declined to release the woman's name. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, it is her role to examine the site and make recommendations 
regarding the treatment and disposition of the remains," Commission Executive 
Secretary Larry Myers said. "Even one burial makes the site significant. If it 
is determined that the remains be moved, it must be done in a respectful and 
dignified manner." 
</P>
<P>
 But W. Butch Britt, the county's deputy public works director, said that aside 
from the tooth and bone fragments, no other hard evidence of human remains has 
been discovered at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Britt said he expects the Santa Rosa Road improvement project to continue 
after the tooth and other fragments are carefully reburied nearby according to 
tribal customs. A prior study found no evidence of human remains, he said. 
</P>

 "In 1991 a study turned up some 2,800 fragments from 17 different animal 
species. However, no hard evidence of human remains was found there," Britt 
said. "Once we comply with the most likely descendant's wishes, I'm hopeful 
that we can move ahead with the project." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 However, archeologists and tribal observers from the Thousand Oaks-based 
California Indian Council/Chumash organization vowed to stop -- physically if 
necessary -- further grading of the site unless an in-depth study is conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are prepared to step in front of the earthmoving equipment in order to 
stop work there," said council spokesman Reggie Pagaling. "We are also prepared 
to take the county to court on this. We cannot afford to allow this site to be 
destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 Pagaling said the council wants the county to determine the site's full sacred 
and archeological significance. He said the National Historic Preservation Act 
and the California Environmental Quality Act mandate such an examination. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee C. Fraser, a Simi Valley-based archeologist hired by the council, said 
the finding of possible human remains would negate the county's 1991 study. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Britt, Fraser said five test areas at the site have been 
excavated in recent days and in all five evidence was found of possible human 
remains and stone tools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this site is incredibly significant," Fraser said. "Sites like 
this are critical in our ability to understand the prehistory of California. 
It's not something that should be plowed through."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER $250 DONATION LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will kick off what is expected to be a lively political year 
Tuesday by considering a campaign-reform measure that would limit donations to 
$250 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 With the cost of elections rising here in recent years, some city leaders feel 
that restrictions are needed to keep wealthy contributors from having a 
disproportionate influence on city government. 
</P>
<P>
 Wording in the proposed ordinance says controls are needed to maintain "public 
trust in government institutions and the electoral process." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, however, say the measure is unnecessarily complicated, may not hold 
up in court and would unfairly aid incumbents, three of whom are up for 
reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "Primarily, our main concern is that this is going to end up favoring 
incumbents," said Michele L. Oliver, executive director of United Laguna, a 
group that has been critical of the council majority in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But most council members already have signaled their intention to adopt such 
restrictions, voting 4 to 1 in November to move forward with the proposal once 
revisions were made. Councilman Wayne Peterson cast the dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was crafted by the League of Women Voters of Orange Coast and 
Orange County Common Cause and has the backing of Village Laguna, the city's 
largest political action committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The law would not limit the amount of their own money candidates can spend. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents are expecting the 1994 council race to be particularly divisive 
in Laguna Beach, partly because of the political backlash that followed the 
October fire. Some residents blamed the council majority for not giving earlier 
support to a water reservoir the residents said would have helped firefighters 
battle the blaze that claimed 366 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members who came under criticism at that time are the same ones whose 
terms expire this year: Lida Lenney, Robert F. Gentry and Mayor Ann Christoph. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fire, then-mayor Lenney asked the state office of emergency services 
to investigate the city's response. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign-reform ordinance has been examined by the city attorney's office 
and revised, including an adjustment that would allow husbands and wives each 
to make contributions of $250. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; AWARD GIVEN HEAD OF MARDAN CENTER

<P>
 David A. Eisenman has been teaching students with learning disabilities and 
emotional problems in Orange County for 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But he says it's the lessons his students teach him that make the job so 
rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are the best teachers," said the 57-year-old Costa Mesa resident. 
"They are always showing us new things. There is a tremendous satisfaction in 
working with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenman recently received the 1993 Award of Merit from the Learning 
Disabilities Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The group honored Eisenman as an education pioneer who in 1962 opened one of 
the county's first private schools specifically designed for youths with 
learning or emotional troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mardan Center in Irvine now has an enrollment of 110 students and a staff 
of 45 people, including 23 teachers. It draws students from throughout Southern 
California, and some of its alumni have gone on to prestigious universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and public school officials turn to the Mardan Center for help with 
children who are having trouble succeeding in the normal school environment, 
Eisenman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the students have such learning disabilities as dyslexia or attention 
deficit disorder. Others are depressed or have trouble dealing with other 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are not making it in a normal setting because they have special 
problems," Eisenman said. "These are mostly children with average to above 
average abilities who cannot maintain themselves in a public school 
atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mardan Center offers classes for preschoolers through high school 
students. Class sizes are small, most with fewer than 12 students per teacher. 
In addition to personalized instruction, the school offers a variety of 
counseling services for students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to offer a support system," Eisenman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuition is $20,000 a year, though many students receive substantial discounts 
based on their financial need. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenman earned a master's degree in educational psychology at USC and worked 
as a teacher and school psychologist for the Los Angeles Unified School 
District before opening his own school in a small Costa Mesa medical suite in 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Orange County offered little in the way of help for students with 
learning disabilities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some families drove up to Los Angeles a few times a week for clinical help 
because Orange County had nothing to offer," Eisenman said. "It was too far for 
some of them to drive." 
</P>
<P>
 From its start with just two students, Mardan Center has grown over the last 
31 years. All the while, Eisenman has remained as executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a repetitive business," he said. "It's great to know that every 
day you will learn something new." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; RECALL GROUP SAYS SIGNATURES SUFFICIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers of a campaign to recall Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin, City Council 
members Don Bankhead and Molly McClanahan and City Clerk Anne M. York say they 
have collected enough signatures to qualify their measure for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas S. Babcock, chairman of the Fullerton Recalls Committee, said more than 
100 volunteers have collected about 9,000 signatures on petitions naming each 
city official. 
</P>
<P>
 To hold an election, the recall group must present at least 8,329 signatures 
later this month to the city clerk's office. A recall election would ask 
residents whether to remove the city officials from office. 
</P>
<P>
 The petitions to recall Bankhead and McClanahan must be turned in by Jan. 24. 
The recall group has until Jan. 31 to collect signatures against Catlin and 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Babcock said volunteers will try to collect 20% to 30% more signatures than 
needed to guard against the rejection of some names on the list. Only 
signatures from registered voters who live in Fullerton may be counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin, Bankhead and McClanahan are targeted because of their support for a 2% 
utility users tax, which they voted for in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin and Bankhead were first served with recall papers at the packed council 
meeting when they voted to impose the tax. More than 500 residents attended 
that meeting, and most denounced the tax on their telephone, electricity, 
water, natural gas and cable television bills. 
</P>
<P>
 York was added to the recall campaign after she rejected two recall forms that 
were too long. Babcock said he felt York was improperly biased against the 
recall campaign. WILLSON CUMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COAST GUARD GROUP PROUD OF RESCUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Allan Smidt, the new commander of the Ventura U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, 
there's nothing better than placing his 60-foot cabin cruiser between a 
disabled vessel and harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing that you've done something like save a life or save someone's boat is 
a great feeling -- I think it's what motivates all of us here," said Smidt, who 
relieved Ken Coddington on Jan. 1 as commander of the auxiliary. 
</P>
<P>
 During 1993, the 40-member flotilla, based at Ventura Harbor and working under 
the direction of the Coast Guard's Channel Islands Harbor base, pulled seven 
people from the water and saved an estimated $160,000 worth of vessels from 
destruction. The flotilla, which also operates an air wing, performed more than 
100 patrols, logging more than 250 hours in the air and 330 hours on the sea 
during rescue missions. 
</P>
<P>
 The auxiliary participates in nearly all Coast Guard activities with the 
exception of law enforcement operations. It also conducts courtesy vessel 
inspections and provides free classes to the public on vessel handling and 
vessel safety, according to Paul Sherman, the group's public affairs officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be surprised how many people don't have a clue as to how to handle 
their boats," Sherman said. "Besides the rescues, we end up doing a lot of 
on-the-spot boating safety education." 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands Coast Guard officials say their job would be hard to do 
without the auxiliary's support. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't have them, our lives would be very difficult," said Coast Guard 
Petty Officer Marc Engelbrecht, who serves as a liaison officer to the 
auxiliary. "All I have to do is pick up the phone any time of the day or night 
and they're there -- you can't ask for much more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the auxiliary actually provided vessels for the Coast Guard 
to use when the service found its own vessels in dry dock. 
</P>
<P>
 Another job of the auxiliary is to provide the Coast Guard with real-life 
training exercises. Members will motor their boats near a rocky breakwater, cut 
their engines and then call the Coast Guard, feigning engine failure. Coast 
Guard members practice rescue techniques, sometimes allowing the auxiliary's 
yachts to drift dangerously close to the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "With what some of these vessels are worth, it places a decidedly different 
edge to the exercise," Engelbrecht said. Coast Guard trainees "put a little 
more time into their planning to make sure the rescue works the first time."

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the 12th straight year, Peer Swan has been selected president of the 
Irvine Ranch Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's board of directors made the appointment at a meeting last month 
when it also selected Darryl Miller as vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan, 49, treasurer at Pacific Scientific Co. and is a director of Southern 
California Bank. He also serves as chairman of the National Water Research 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 He said one of the challenges facing the district in 1994 is continuing to 
implement the Total Quality Management Program, which is designed to make the 
district more responsive to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also plans to begin a pilot project at the San Joaquin Marsh that 
calls for the pumping of reclaimed water into the wetlands to see if it 
benefits the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan compared his role as district president to that of a mayor. He and the 
four other board members are elected by voters every four years in much the way 
a city council is chosen. The board sets policy for the district while 
employees run the district's day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
 As directors, Swan and Miller receive $167 for each meeting they attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we operate as a team and always have," Swan said of the board. "We 
work together very well. I think I have their confidence." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; POLICE DOG DINGO DIES AFTER SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 10-year-old police dog believed to be the oldest active-duty canine in 
Orange County has died, according to the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Dingo died at 9:15 p.m. Wednesday, apparently from complications after surgery 
to remove several cysts in his hind leg, said Officer Dave Stetson, the dog's 
handler. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog has been credited with helping police in locating suspects, including 
a suspected burglar who was arrested on Hospital Road after the dog directed 
police to where he was hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said that Dingo was the first police dog to join the 
department's canine unit 6 1/2 years ago after earning high marks during 
training in Germany.  
</P>
<P>
 Dingo will be buried Wednesday at 10 a.m. at Sea Breeze Pet Cemetery, 19542 
Beach Blvd., in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no immediate plans to replace Dingo because of lack of money. Those 
interested in donating may call (714) 644-3662 or (714) 644-3717.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; SUIT SEEKS $120,000 IN HOTEL BED TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has filed a lawsuit against the Dana Point Hilton, seeking more than 
$120,000 in allegedly unpaid bed taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed Dec. 30 in Orange County Superior Court, claims that the 
nearly 2-year-old, 197-room hotel has only intermittently paid its share of 
taxes since April.Hotels in Dana Point are required by law to pay the city 10% 
of their room rental receipts as transient occupancy taxes -- often called bed 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of the city's $10.25 million in annual revenues come from bed 
taxes from Dana Point's 15 hotels and motels, according to a city spokeswoman. 
Bed taxes are due to the city within 20 days of the final day of every month, 
according to city law. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's lawsuit alleges that the Hilton first failed to pay its complete 
share of taxes last April. During that month, the hotel paid only half of a 
total of $30,974.30 in taxes, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the hotel has also failed to pay any taxes for the months of June, 
October and November, according to papers filed in court. Including interest 
and penalties, the hotel has accumulated a debt of more than $120,000 to the 
city, the lawsuit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 A city spokesman said all attempts to negotiate with the hotel have failed. A 
meeting between hotel and city officials is scheduled for this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel, at 34402 Pacific Coast Highway, is owned by the Rowland 
Heights-based Taj Development Corp., whose president and chief owner is 
Chandulal K. Patel. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Point Hilton Manager Barry Dean said Monday he knew nothing of the suit 
or problems with bed taxes and referred questions to Patel. Patel couldn't be 
reached for comment.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; JUDGE RULES CITY'S UTILITY TAX LEGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge has ruled that the city's 2% utility tax was properly created this 
summer, though only three of five City Council members approved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Chamber of Commerce president Thomas J. O'Neill sued the city in 
August, arguing that the tax was illegal.O'Neill charged that four council 
members needed to support the tax on telephone, electricity, water, natural gas 
and cable television services. 
</P>
<P>
 But Superior Court Judge Richard W. Luesebrink ruled Dec. 27 that the tax was 
legally imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Auditor-Controller Steven E. Lewis, who had also filed a 
complaint questioning the legality of the tax, said he will not appeal the 
judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis told the city he might have to withhold property taxes from the city if 
the utility tax were illegally collected. He said Monday he will not withhold 
any money. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James L. Armstrong said he was pleased by the judge's decision. 
The tax is expected to add about $1.6 million to the city treasury by the end 
of June. City officials said it costs the average household about $4.40 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and council members Molly McClanahan and Don Bankhead 
voted to impose the tax. Council members Julie Sa and Chris Norby opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. R.K. (Kerry) Fox said the city has spent about $27,000 to defend 
the utility tax. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; WOMAN SETTLES SUIT AGAINST MATCHMAKER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 72-year-old Fullerton woman has settled her lawsuit against a matchmaker who 
paired her with men who she claimed were "beyond life expectancy" or a 
generation too young. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit filed in Superior Court, Ethel Ashley alleged that Orly Hadida, 
owner of Orly's Personal Touch Matchmaker, failed to honor a one-year, $10,000 
VIP contract to provide her with unlimited referrals to men who earned more 
than $500,000 a year and were available for marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in October, stated that Ashley had four dates in five 
months and that the men were too young or too old and did not make the required 
salary. It alleged breach of contract and sought $200,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have resolved my dispute with Orly Hadida and I withdraw any complaints" 
against her, Ashley wrote in a statement announcing the settlement. The terms 
of the settlement are confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl Hansen, attorney for Hadida, said the settlement "will allow both 
parties to get on with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The matchmaker, whose business has been featured in newspapers and on 
television talk shows, has an office in Newport Beach and others in Southern 
California. JON NALICK

 Two men burned to death when their car flipped and burst into flames on a 
remote section of California 126 near Fillmore, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, who have not yet been identified, were heading west the highway late 
Sunday when their car careened off the road, struck an embankment, flipped over 
and caught fire, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were unable to get out of the vehicle before it began to burn, a CHP 
officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 It could take several days to identify the men, an official from the Ventura 
County coroner's office said Monday. Tests showed both survived the crash but 
were killed in the ensuing fire. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; GROUP TO DISCUSS POLICE TAX MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Port Hueneme residents who want to retain the city Police Department rather 
than contract out for services have scheduled a meeting tonight on how to sell 
a special police tax to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The June ballot measure would call for enacting special taxes on all 
businesses and homeowners as well as renters within the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7 p.m. meeting of newly formed Save Our Port Hueneme Police Department 
will be held in the Richard Bard Elementary School cafeteria at 622 E. Pleasant 
Valley Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was formed after the City Council received money saving contract 
offers from the county Sheriff's Department and the Oxnard Police Department 
and the council decided to give voters the choice of paying the $500,000 to be 
saved by eliminating the city department. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme has sliced $900,000 a year from its $6.5-million budget and 
eliminated a dozen city jobs since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The average renter's tax would be $35 a year, while homeowners' taxes would 
increase an average of $50 a year. Owners of retail buildings would pay $600 
more annually and industrial property owners $300 more, city studies show. 
</P>
<P>
 Valorie Morrison, a leader of the group, said Monday she believes residents 
are willing to pay to have a more responsive Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel so safe having our own department," Morrison said. "The officers know 
everybody and everything. We know the benefits of our own Police Department: 
Our police go out on every call." 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme Police Detective Ken Dobbe will present a $1,000 check from the 
Port Hueneme Police Officers Assn. at tonight's meeting for the campaign. The 
department has 30 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should help get the ball rolling," Dobbe said. "We can respond faster 
and react quicker if we can handle calls without going through the chain of 
command of the Sheriff's Department." PATRICK McCARTNEY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; HANDYMAN IN FATAL SHOOTING SURRENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-year-old handyman who killed a Ventura thrift store owner surrendered to 
authorities Monday after a judge allowed him to remain free through the New 
Year's holiday.  
</P>
<P>
 Charles Bothwell of El Rio had failed to show up for a previous court 
appearance to begin serving a three-year prison sentence for voluntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bothwell shot and killed 41-year-old Robert Allen Foster on Sept. 5, claiming 
the owner of the Starvation Army Store had molested a 14-year-old girl he knew. 
He was sentenced Nov. 5 to three years in prison, but allowed to remain free 
until Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 29, as police investigated three forgery complaints against him, 
Bothwell asked Ventura County Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch to send him 
to prison early. Storch set a Dec. 15 court hearing for Bothwell's surrender, 
but the defendant failed to show up for the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the judge issued an arrest warrant for Bothwell -- but 
suspended the warrant until Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Grant said Monday that the forgery complaints are 
still being reviewed by prosecutors. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; WOMAN FINDS RACIST FLYER IN SODA PACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Camarillo woman became the latest victim of a white supremacist group that 
has been distributing racist flyers in Ventura and Los Angeles counties when 
she found one of the notes tucked into a 12-pack of soda, authorities said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw the paper I thought I had maybe won a contest," said Marion 
Elsey."But then I opened it up. It made me sick." 
</P>
<P>
 The note, she said, urged violence against minorities and included a phone 
number for recruiting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsey said she bought the soda at a small market in Camarillo on Sunday and 
did not notice the note until she was unloading the cans into her refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 She immediately called the Camarillo sheriff's station, where deputies told 
her the note was one of many that have been found in the county since October. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar flyers have appeared in other 12-packs of soda, backpacks, Christmas 
stockings, pantyhose containers and in lockers at Simi Valley High School, 
police have confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, a man was caught distributing the flyers. But authorities said 
they could not prosecute him because the leaflets are protected by 
constitutional free speech safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to teach my children that all people are equal, and then they are 
exposed to something like this," Elsey said. "I'm disgusted by the whole 
thing." MATTHEW MOSK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; HELPING KIDS IN FAMILIES HIT BY AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Lyons is 39 years old and single, but, friends say, he probably spends too 
much time collecting diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 He lives by the beach in San Clemente and drives to work in a Mercedes-Benz, 
but for the past two years, as head of Kids Connection Inc., he has been up to 
his ears in baby lotion, shampoo, cribs, formula and children's clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Tustin office, shelves upon shelves of the baby items are stacked, 
ready for delivery to families in which someone has AIDS or HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids Connection Inc. is the only nonprofit group in Orange County that devotes 
itself exclusively to helping families cope with the devastating disease by 
providing them with basic necessities such as diapers, baby food and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very expensive disease," said Lyons, a Boston native who has been 
involved in AIDS programs for at least five of the 19 years that he has lived 
in Orange County. "I've seen friends go from living in mansions to dying dirt 
poor." 
</P>
<P>
 While the disease afflicts people of all economic groups, it's particularly 
devastating to the poor, who make up a majority of the group's clients, Lyons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In helping clients, the group works with such agencies as the AIDS Service 
Foundation, Children's Hospital of Orange County and UC Irvine HIV Pediatric 
Services. His group seeks donations of baby food, clothes and other needs and 
delivers them to the affected families. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're like a middleman," Lyons said. "The agencies provide us with what the 
families need, and we go out and find (the items). We're quick, we're fast, 
because there is no red tape involved." 
</P>
<P>
 For Christmas, Kids Connection distributed gift baskets to 217 children from 
57 families, he said. In addition to the usual baby items, the baskets 
contained food and toys for the stricken children and their siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each child received two or three gifts," said David I. Armendariz, director 
of volunteer services of AIDS Services Foundation, which provided the list of 
families. "It was a huge job." 
</P>
<P>
 Armendariz said that each family had a "wish list," and Kids Connection 
volunteers tried to provide everything that was on the list, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of children infected with AIDS is growing in Orange County, 
according to the Orange County Health Care Agency, which tracks AIDS cases. As 
of November, there have been 21 reported cases. Nine children have died. 
</P>
<P>
 In more than half of the cases -- 13 -- the disease was transmitted by the 
child's mother, according to Cathy Higgins, a research analyst with the Health 
Care Agency. Because of the increasing number of women infected with AIDS or 
carrying the AIDS virus, more children are likely to get the disease, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins said that the health agency estimates that there are about 66 AIDS- 
and HIV-infected children in the county, including unreported cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyons said that one of his group's goals is to educate the public that AIDS is 
not just a "gay disease" but also strikes children. There are still people who 
believe that the disease is the fault of the infected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for the most part, attitudes about the disease have changed, and many 
people want to do something, Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to get involved, they just don't know how," he said. "We have to 
provide them with a vehicle. It's the most we can do."BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; RANCHERS MAY APPLY FOR RESEEDING GRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Farmers and ranchers whose land was burned during the October fires may apply 
for reseeding grants from the Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the grant program is to reseed barren hillsides before heavy rains 
cause erosion and possible mudslides, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of farms and ranches can receive as much as $3,500 from the federal 
government to pay for planting grass and trees on the burned land. Each grant 
application must be approved by a USDA regional committee before funds for 
reseeding are allocated. 
</P>
<P>
 USDA officials said they hope the grants will encourage owners to quickly 
reseed their land. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Perez, spokesman for the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, said that the 
USDA is also working in Laguna Beach, Altadena and Malibu to identify areas 
that present a mudslide danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said federal officials are concerned that the burned hillsides could 
cause sediment to get into the water runoff, decreasing water quality. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the grants, call (805) 942-9549 or (805) 945-2604.

OXNARD; MAN BOOKED ON SUSPICION OF BURGLARY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard police arrested an Ojai man early Monday after a silent alarm warned of 
a possible burglary in progress at the Price Club in Oxnard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that when they arrived at the store, they spotted a man running 
from the rear of the building and detained him. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Donat, 31, told police he is a security guard for the store but could 
not produce any identification, investigators said. While searching Donat, 
police said they found an undisclosed amount of jewelry, which they believe was 
taken from the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Donat was booked at Ventura County Jail on suspicion of burglary, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Store officials declined to comment. MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; LIMOUSINE DRIVER ARRESTED IN THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A driver for a Newbury Park limousine service was arrested on suspicion of 
being in possession of a stolen auto Monday, about 24 hours after he radioed a 
dispatcher that he was sick, then disappeared with a stretch limousine, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies said police arrested Gregory Allen Lee as he 
attempted to walk away from the limousine in Van Nuys about 7:30 p.m. 
Monday.The vehicle was stripped of most of its contents, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's in custody. He's telling a story about being kidnaped," Sheriff's 
Sgt. Terry Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said they answered a call Sunday night from the limousine company 
after a dispatcher reported that Lee had called in to say he had passed out and 
did not know where he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, 39, of Simi Valley then told the dispatcher that he was at a gas station 
in Chatsworth, company officials said. But Los Angeles police who went to that 
location could not find him. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee had not been in contact with any family members since he disappeared about 
7 p.m. Sunday, said Ventura County Sheriff's Detective Ernie Montagna. 
</P>
<P>
 Montagna said officials received reports throughout Monday about sightings of 
white stretch limousines similar to the one Lee was driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee had only worked for the company for 12 days, but had passed a medical exam 
and background check before being hired, said Marty Diaz, manager of Shoreline 
Limousine. MATTHEW MOSK

<P>
 Temperatures in Ventura County soared into the high 70s and low 80s as a 
summer-like weather system moved through Southern California on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Piru was the hottest spot in the county, with a high temperature of 84 degrees 
-- about 20 degrees warmer than usual, meteorologists for the National Weather 
Service in Oxnard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature reached 80 degrees in Thousand Oaks, while Ventura was a balmy 
76. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really more like July," said meteorologist David Gomberg. "January 
should be more like mid-60s." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't get out the beach umbrella yet. Temperatures are expected to drop 
today, Gomberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be at least 10 degrees cooler," Gomberg said. TINA DAUNT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER LIMITING GARAGE SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will discuss an ordinance today that would limit residents to 
two garage sales a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance grew out of complaints that some residents were holding 
garage sales nearly every week, causing traffic snarls and littering 
neighborhoods with advertising signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is not expected to take a final vote tonight but probably will 
schedule a public hearing on the matter Jan. 18, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposed ordinance is passed, residents will have to register with the 
city before holding a garage sale. Also, residents will be prohibited from 
posting garage-sale signs on public property.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; YWCA GETS GRANT FOR PLANNED HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The YWCA has received a $2.1-million federal grant to run a planned hotel for 
low-income women, a spokeswoman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The YWCA won the grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to 
operate a 75-unit single-room-occupancy hotel, which could be built by 1996, 
said YWCA executive director Mary Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving the grant "is a wonderful step forward for the county. It's 
literally verifying that we do have people in need," Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The YWCA now provides temporary shelter for about 38 women a day at its site 
at 1411 N. Broadway but offers no permanent housing. The new hotel will be 
built as an addition to that shelter and provide small rooms with kitchens and 
bathrooms for about $350 to $375 a month, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The YWCA is still seeking public grants and private donations to help build 
the hotel. Depending on how quickly the money can be raised, the hotel could be 
built within two years, Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about volunteering or donating, call (714) 542-3577. Checks 
may be sent to: YWCA Shelter for Homeless Women, 1411 N. Broadway, Santa Ana, 
Calif. 92706.

COUNTY AND IRVINE CO. MAY SETTLE SUIT OVER EASEMENT; LAND USE: DISPUTE INVOLVES 
VALUE OF LAND SEIZED FOR NEW FREEWAY ACCESS RAMP FROM JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five days before trial, the Orange County Airport Commission will be asked on 
Wednesday to pay the Irvine Co. $437,500 to settle a lengthy and complicated 
legal dispute over an easement near John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The easement along the San Diego Freeway was seized from the Irvine Co. by the 
county for maintenance of a new ramp connecting the airport's parking garages 
with the northbound lanes of the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 During the dispute, the Irvine Co. has contended that an old appraisal for the 
land is too low and that a retaining wall built to support the ramp lowered the 
rental value of offices in its Executive Park industrial complex adjacent to 
the San Diego freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the Irvine Co. say the appraisal of the easement at $58,000 was 
never enough, and rents are affected because the retaining wall hides some 
tenants' corporate signs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposed settlement is approved by the commission, it will go before 
the Board of Supervisors next week for a final decision to end the four-year 
legal fight which is headed for trial on Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is a novel one in which the Irvine Co. lost on an earlier pretrial 
issue of "abutter's rights," a legal theory stating that land owners can 
collect damages for certain things that occur on property near theirs. The 
company had threatened to appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Irvine Co. sued in Superior Court, the litigation has grown more 
complicated as other parties filed lawsuits related to the easement and 
retaining wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchell Contractors, a tenant in Executive Park, claimed it has lost the 
effectiveness of any signs. Caltrans was sued too, and then Caltrans hit Orange 
County with a lawsuit, alleging that the county should have indemnified it 
against any problems caused by the easement. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a legal mess, said Robert Waldron, an attorney for the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The county also has had some second thoughts. Deputy County Counsel Edward N. 
Duran said some factors were not included in the original estimate of the 
easement's market value. When several years of inflation and interest are taken 
into account, he said, it all adds up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good settlement for everybody," Duran said.

RECORDER'S OFFICE ADMINISTRATOR TO BE REASSIGNED; GOVERNMENT: THE TRANSFER OF 
NANCY SMITH WOULD BE THE FIRST ACTION IN A 2-MONTH INVESTIGATION OF SEXUAL 
HARASSMENT AND PHYSICAL ABUSE ALLEGATIONS IN THE OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An administrator in the Orange County Recorder's office whose personal 
relationship with embattled Recorder Lee A. Branch has become part of a county 
investigation is expected to be reassigned to another job in county government, 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer of Nancy L. Smith, the office documents manager who has been on a 
paid leave since October, would be the first action taken in a two-month-long 
investigation of sexual harassment and physical abuse allegations within the 
recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is that's what is going to happen," Assistant Recorder Ella 
M. Murphy said of the transfer. "I called (county Personnel Director Russ 
Patton's office), and they were still working on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Patton and other county officials could not be reached for comment Monday. 
Murphy said she did not know where Smith would be assigned or what position she 
would fill. 
</P>
<P>
 A source familiar with the investigation said, however, that the transfer 
would be a lateral move. "It's just too disruptive to have her in the office," 
the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who has worked in the office for the past 22 1/2 years and earns about 
$40,000 a year, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch has acknowledged a personal relationship with Smith and employees have 
alleged that the recorder has shown favoritism to the documents manager. 
Sources said investigators have questioned whether Smith tried to undercut 
higher-ranking members of the department. Employees have also been questioned 
about an incident in which Smith was alleged to have grabbed a worker while 
strongly scolding her. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has denied the allegations. She is expected to return to work when the 
reassignment is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is being conducted by the county's Affirmative Action Office 
within the Personnel Department. It is also exploring claims that Branch made 
lewd comments to a female employee in the office and that the recorder shoved 
an employee who had been seen talking to a union representative. 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials acknowledge that even if Branch's conduct is found to be 
improper, they have little authority to penalize the recorder because he is an 
elected official. The Personnel Department, which is responsible for the 
investigation, cannot fire or suspend Branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch also could not be reached for comment Monday, but he has repeatedly 
denied the allegations, stating that they are politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Monday, investigators were said to be close to completing their 
study of misconduct allegations against Branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch has already been urged by county officials to resign his position 
because of the allegations. Sources said Monday that efforts would continue to 
seek the recorder's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said Monday that she knew nothing of Branch's plans, adding only that 
the recorder had been "in and out" of the office in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 An employee in the office since 1956, Branch, 57, assumed control of the 
obscure elective office in 1978. The office is the repository for nearly a 
million documents each year, most dealing with real estate transactions.

LIFTING 2,800 EGGS LEADS TO LAWSUIT; COURT: PLAINTIFF CLAIMS HELPING HOIST A 
BIG POT IN THE ORANGE COUNTY JAIL'S KITCHEN RESULTED IN A BACK INJURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When a cook at the Orange County Jail told Matthew Olsen to help lift a 3-foot 
pot containing 2,800 eggs, Olsen obliged but his back didn't, according to a 
suit filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen, 31, of Huntington Beach alleges in the suit filed in Orange County 
Superior Court that he was in the jail's kitchen on Dec. 8, 1992, when the cook 
asked him to help an inmate hoist the steel pot, which, he claims, weighed 600 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 As the men lifted the pot, Olsen reportedly suffered tremendous pain in his 
lower back and dropped the pot to the floor, the lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen's suit states that the injury may result in a permanent disability and 
it asks for medical expenses, court costs and lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit does not make clear what Olsen was doing in the kitchen or whether he 
works there. Neither he nor his attorney could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen's written claim for injuries, disability, losses and damages was 
rejected by the county on July 12.

MOTHER PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN BRIBERY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 43-year-old Buena Park woman pleaded not guilty Monday to felony charges 
that she tried to bribe witnesses not to testify against her sons in two gang 
robbery trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Trinidad Rodarte, handcuffed and wearing jail fatigues, said nothing as 
Municipal Judge Dan C. Dutcher denied her attorney's request for lower bail, 
which had been set at $40,000.Rodarte is being held at Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodarte allegedly offered to give a woman $500 if she would change her 
testimony about a robbery she had told police was committed by Lino Rodarte, 
21, and other members of the West Trece gang. Police said the elder Rodarte 
also made veiled threats to the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness went to the police, who have offered five tape-recorded phone 
conversations of the two women talking as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The taped exchanges led to charges involving an earlier case, in which a 
witness abruptly changed her testimony concerning robbery and sexual battery 
charges against Rodarte's 24-year-old son, Raul Beruman Rodarte. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Trinidad Rodarte's attorney, Malcolm Gulesarian, said Monday that his 
client was merely a frantic, protective parent trying to protect her sons. He 
said a community movement was underway to raise bail for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bail amount in this case is unbelievable," Gulesarian said. "She's not a 
threat to the community, nor is she a flight risk. She made a mistake, but that 
doesn't make her Public Enemy No. 1."

PROSECUTORS CONCLUDE CASE IN ALLEGED EMBEZZLEMENT; COURTS: FORMER EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR OF IRVINE TEMPORARY HOUSING IS CHARGED WITH FORGING CHECKS AND GRAND 
THEFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Prosecutors concluded their case Monday against a former director of an Irvine 
charity who is accused of embezzling $400,000. The defense prepared to argue 
that the director put as much money into the charity as he took out. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde E. Weinman, 44, former executive director of Irvine Temporary Housing, 
is charged with forging more than 500 checks and grand theft. He could face a 
maximum sentence of eight years in prison and $200,000 in fines if found guilty 
on all 13 felony counts, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Overtoom. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman pleaded not guilty to the charges and began his defense Monday in 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't go bankrupt, have your house foreclosed and two vehicles 
repossessed if you're absconding with money," Weinman said outside of court. 
His attorney said he will show that Weinman poured about $65,000 of his own 
money into the agency to keep it afloat and took about $60,000 out. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman was fired from Irvine Temporary Housing in June, 1992, when the 
agency's board of directors discovered that several thousand dollars were 
missing. He was arrested in November, 1992, and his case came to trial last 
week.  
</P>
<P>
 Weinman had held the $30,000-a-year job since December, 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Temporary Housing was created in 1985 to find shelter for the homeless 
in the Irvine area.  
</P>
<P>
 Overtoom said that Weinman forged the names of the board of directors and made 
checks payable to himself or to companies to which he owed money. 
</P>
<P>
 Overtoom also called Weinman's Lake Forest home a "Taj Mahal," with 
landscaping, a pool and sauna, and said the home improvements were done while 
Weinman was director of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman's attorney, Milton Kerlan Jr., attempted to portray Irvine Temporary 
Housing as a mismanaged organization that was constantly in the red, saying the 
agency was underfunded by at least $100,000 per year.  
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Jean Rheinheimer said she thought it was clear that the 
agency was run "very shoddily," but that was not the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Kerlan said his strategy in the coming days will be to 
show that Weinman was using his own money to keep the agency financially 
viable.  
</P>
<P>
 "Forgery involves the specific intent to defraud," Kerlan said. "The only 
thing (Weinman has) been trying to do is keep a significantly underfunded 
program afloat." 
</P>
<P>
 He conceded, however, that Weinman used "unconventional methods" to accomplish 
his ends.  
</P>
<P>
 "He put himself short by putting his own funds into the program," Kerlan said. 
He added that Weinman made no attempt to hide the fact that he wrote checks to 
himself and cashed them. "He had to take some money out, because he couldn't 
live without it."  
</P>
<P>
 In response to charges that he used charity money to remodel his house, 
Weinman said that he worked as a contractor and painter in addition to his 
position at the agency, that his wife also worked, and that he had inherited 
money from his parents. Weinman also said he did all of the renovations on his 
house himself.  
</P>
<P>
 Judith Wright, former program director of Irvine Temporary Housing, testified 
Monday that Weinman was dedicated to helping the poor and personally worked to 
fix the condominiums where the organization's clients lived.  
</P>
<P>
 "I often saw him go in his own pocket and give people gas money if we didn't 
have it," Wright said.  
</P>
<P>
 Weinman said he "borrowed money from friends to feed my children."  
</P>
<P>
 The defense will continue to present its case today and the jury will begin to 
deliberate next week at the earliest.

RELATIONSHIPS; TRAVELERS' CHECKS; FROM SEEING THE SAME MOVIES TO PHONING DAILY, 
O.C. COUPLES DEAL WITH BEING APART

 Christa Gefke is just getting a chance to catch her breath. Between September 
and December, the mother of a 3- and 5-year-old traveled on business for 5 1/2 
weeks, three of those overseas. Her husband's out-of-town schedule has been 
just as busy.  
</P>
<P>
 Such traveling is nothing new for the Gefkes, who own a sound system 
manufacturing company in Irvine and find frequent travel at certain times of 
the year critical to business success. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the Gefkes travel together, but most of the time one stays in Orange 
County to run the office and tend to the children in their Mission Viejo home. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the Gefkes see their traveling as a positive. Still, it has its 
downside, including the fact that traveling is as exhausting as keeping things 
moving at home.  
</P>
<P>
 The Gefkes are among many couples who have learned to adjust their 
relationships and households to accommodate a lot of work-related travel.  
</P>
<P>
 Leaving home on a continual basis throws a new dynamic into a relationship, 
says psychologist Patricia Thomas Crane, who is director of behavioral health 
at Bristol Park Medical Group in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although traveling isn't necessarily a bad thing, constant traveling can 
create challenging situations," Crane says. "For the couple already having 
problems, the strain of constant travel can make things worse. And even for the 
couple doing well, traveling invariably causes some stress."  
</P>
<P>
 A major source of tension when one spouse travels often is that the division 
of labor can become askew, Crane says. All of the domestic responsibilities and 
obligations tend to fall on the person at home.  
</P>
<P>
 And, because couples have less time together when one spouse travels, there is 
also the potential that the relationship won't get enough attention.  
</P>
<P>
 Many couples who know traveling as a way of life adjust well, however, and 
some find that there are benefits to being separated.  
</P>
<P>
 "For some couples, traveling injects unpredictability and excitement into the 
relationship, which they find appealing," Crane says. "Couples who travel a 
great deal may also be cognizant of the value of time together, and in some 
cases might even spend more quality time together than couples who don't 
travel."  
</P>
<P>
 From reading the same books when they are apart to making daily phone calls, 
the following Orange County couples have found ways to deal with and even 
thrive in the midst of frequent travel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Gefkes each spend about 60 days away from home each year to reach clients 
throughout the United States and the world. Their trips can last anywhere from 
two days to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 They see many positives stemming from their travels.  
</P>
<P>
 "Traveling spices things up a bit and gives you a change of pace," says Jeff, 
37, who heads the design and production end of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't not do what I'm doing," agrees Christa, 34, who is in charge of 
sales and marketing for the company. "I like the opportunities I'm getting to 
see the world. I also like the fact that when I'm traveling, I have a real 
sense of being me."  
</P>
<P>
 Although traveling can be invigorating for both the Gefkes, they do experience 
some loneliness on the road.  
</P>
<P>
 "Generally when I go away on a long trip, the first three days are tough while 
I get over missing the family, and the last few days are also rough," Christa 
says. "When I went to Chicago for 2 1/2 weeks, by the last three days, every 
time I thought about the kids and Jeff, I cried."  
</P>
<P>
 Christa finds the return time especially challenging. "Even though I've missed 
my family horribly, it's difficult to get back into the family routine for the 
first few days. Jeff and I end up disagreeing on little things until I get back 
into the swing of it."  
</P>
<P>
 To keep their relationship strong with one another and the kids, the Gefkes do 
several things while on the road, including talking by phone daily.  
</P>
<P>
 "We spend a half an hour to an hour each day talking about business and 
personal concerns," Jeff says. "Communication on a daily basis is important to 
maintain the relationship; otherwise you lose that connection." 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to actively listen to one another on the phone, Christa says. 
"You must not only hear each other's words, but silences, too," she says. "Jeff 
and I try hard to listen to what each of us is saying and not saying." 
</P>
<P>
 When the rigors of traveling take their toll on one person, the other will 
jump in with support. "It's tough to be separated, and sometimes when you're 
far away and lonely you lose sight of your goals," Jeff says. "One of us will 
justify the end by doing a little cheerleading and talking about time in the 
future we'll be spending together."  
</P>
<P>
 When they are away from home, the Gefkes also talk to their children daily. 
"If you are a traveling parent, you have to become good at seeing things that 
your children are talking about, because they will say things like, 'Look, 
Mommy, isn't this pretty?' Or they will walk into a room and tell you what's 
there."  
</P>
<P>
 If she will be traveling for more than a few days, Christa will prepare a menu 
for the children and a picture calendar that they can cross off each day. "In 
the first and last boxes I'll draw an airplane. In the other boxes I'll draw 
things like a bike if they're scheduled to go on a bike ride, or a duck if 
they'll be going to feed the ducks," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 To help the children deal with traveling, the Gefkes also stick to several 
rituals, including taking the kids to the airport and letting them help pack 
and unpack.  
</P>
<P>
 "We try to get them as involved in the traveling process as possible," Jeff 
says. "Seeing us leave and then return makes them more comfortable and assures 
them that we will return." 
</P>
<P>

 Two years ago, Tom Glagola, 47, an engineer for an oil company, accepted a 
position as proposal manager, which meant that he would be doing a lot of 
traveling. And he has traveled a lot, including an overseas assignment that 
meant a nine-month stay in Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 Since he embarked on the international travel scene, Glagola and his wife, 
author Noreen Ayres, 53, have found that traveling has its positive and 
negative effects on their relationship.  
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, traveling is good for the relationship, Ayres says. "When Tom 
was in Japan for nine months, we were both lively and interested, and our 
general outlook and attitude was more optimistic and energized. It was also 
good for us as individuals, which inevitably positively affected our 
relationship as a couple. Being separated means you must make independent 
decisions on a regular basis. Once you get beyond the stress, this boosts your 
self-confidence," says Ayres, who was promoting her first Orange County mystery 
novel, "A World the Color of Salt," while Glagola was in Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 "The experience of traveling has been very enlightening and broadening for me 
and has put some spontaneity into our lives," Glagola agrees. "At times, Noreen 
has flown to be with me, which has been exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 It is this same unpredictability that can be difficult for the couple to deal 
with at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traveling a great deal is definitely a high-tension lifestyle," says Glagola, 
who sometimes has to leave on a moment's notice. "It's not for those people who 
like security, solidity and routine." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the unpredictability of when Glagola will need to travel, the 
couple's social plans are often up in the air. "We have a terrible reputation 
for canceling social engagements," he says. "It is also difficult for me to 
complete any projects around the house, because I may start one and not be able 
to get back to it for three months."  
</P>
<P>
 To ease the tension brought on by trips, Ayres will often do what she can to 
make the departure pleasant, which includes driving him to the airport and 
seeing him off.  
</P>
<P>
 In order to keep their relationship going strong, Glagola and Ayres stay 
connected while he is traveling by doing several things, the most important of 
which is talking on the phone on a regular basis.  
</P>
<P>
 "Running up the phone bills is really the only way to keep the closeness," 
says Ayres, who had $400 and $500 phone bills on her end when Glagola was in 
Japan. "Without the connection of the phone, it's easy to draw apart on 
long-term and even short-term separations. The small things each of you mention 
really keep you on track. I don't know how many times over the years Tom has 
shared his experiences with me, like seeing a sunset in Alaska."  
</P>
<P>
 Keeping in touch by phone can sometimes mean speaking at odd hours when there 
is a large time difference involved. In Japan, there is a 16-hour time 
difference from here, which meant that Glagola would sometimes have to talk to 
Ayres at 3 a.m. his time. In order to do this, he would set his alarm and give 
her a call. Their conversations often lasted half an hour to an hour. At the 
end of each call, they would set a time for the next call, including backup 
times.  
</P>
<P>
 The couple also stays connected by reading the same books while separated and 
talking about them on the phone. This sharing is very enjoyable for them, as 
they are both avid readers. They also try to see the same movies when they can, 
which gives them another conversation link.  
</P>
<P>
 In many ways Glagola and Ayres feel that although his constant traveling has 
been challenging at times, they have grown from the experience and it has 
enriched their relationship. "You learn and grow from the experience, and I 
really think you become richer people as result," Glagola says. 
</P>

 It's 5 on Friday afternoon, and Ron Bieler is due home. His wife and four 
children are expecting him, but he won't be pulling up in the driveway. They're 
waiting for their dad at the airport, where he'll soon land in his own 
airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost six years, Bieler, 51, who is an acupuncturist and doctor of 
Oriental medicine in Costa Mesa, has lived in Napa in Northern California for 
part of each week. He recently began flying his own plane so he could shorten 
commuting hours and more productively split time between his family and 
patients in Orange County. The trip takes him just two hours. He stays in Napa 
four nights a week.  
</P>
<P>
 When Ron first began traveling, Cora Bieler, 43, says that the transition was 
difficult and put a lot of strain on their relationship. That was eased when 
they made the decision to hire help. "Having Ron gone for several days a week 
required that we supplement the energy of a missing spouse with another 
care-giver," she says. "With four kids and a 3,000-square-foot house, I can't 
do it all myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Ron's flying means he spends less time traveling and more at home 
than he used to, the arrangement is still challenging for the Bielers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Although we talk on the phone every day, when I return after traveling, it 
takes a little while to re-establish communication; it just isn't the same as 
when you come home every night," Ron says. "There is always this element that 
you are living two separate lives. We will often have to spend time going over 
issues that we may have had to set aside the previous week." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron finds that making the transition with his children is also stressful at 
times. "It can be wearing over a period of time," he says. "When I get home, 
I'm happy to see the kids and I get drawn into their lives, which makes it 
difficult to leave again. My youngest often wants to go with me and is usually 
disappointed when that isn't possible. I just say I'll be back on Friday, 
though, and things are usually OK." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep their relationship as a couple and as a family going strong, the 
Bielers use the telephone a great deal. Ron will call the children between 7 
and 8 every evening and sometimes early in the morning.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I talk to the kids, I try to stay current in their lives by asking about 
school and their activities," Ron says. "Just recently I talked to my 
10-year-old about his report on Native Americans (and) to my 6-year-old about 
multiplication tables; my 5-year-old told me her cold was all better, and my 
2-year-old said, 'Want fly your airplane.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Talking on the phone to their father on a consistent basis is important to the 
children. "When you maintain consistent communication, there is a sense of 
trust that you can still rely on that person and that he still exists in your 
world," Cora says.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to talking to the kids in the early evening, Ron will often call 
Cora around 9:30, after the kids are asleep. The couple will talk about 
day-to-day issues and major concerns when necessary.  
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Ron and Cora say that they didn't spend enough time 
concentrating on their relationship as a couple because of a reluctance to 
exclude the children in the limited time available. Now they are focusing more 
on their relationship and making plans to get away alone more often.  
</P>
<P>
 "People in situations like ours have a lack of continuity, and as a result, 
the connection becomes fragile," Cora says. "We realize that it's important to 
strengthen that connection with some alone time." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Ron's constant traveling can be challenging for the Bielers, they have 
found that it has made their relationship stronger overall. "If a relationship 
is already good, I think a situation like ours can make it better," Cora says. 
"In our case, it has really strengthened the knot."

 Heading for the operating room? You might want to take notes first. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients "coached" through surgery with specific instructions about what to 
expect recover faster, found a UC Davis research team. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study, research psychologist Henry L. Bennett and his colleagues gave two 
sets of instructions to patients undergoing abdominal operations for cancer, 
bowel problems and other disorders. The 20 patients in the control group 
received general information about the operation and reassurance that things 
would go well. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20 in the experimental group received much more specific instructions 
about the importance of recovery. To these, Bennett said: "We want your stomach 
and intestines to move, churn and gurgle soon after surgery." The sooner that 
happens, he told them, the quicker normal functioning would return -- and the 
speedier their return to regular foods -- including their favorite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The average hospital stay for the patients getting specific instructions was 
6.5 days, compared to 8.1 for the control group. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant a savings of $1,200 per patient, says Bennett, who published the 
findings earlier this year in the Western Journal of Medicine. Not bad, he 
adds, for the 15-minute time investment with each patient. "It's so simple to 
do," he adds. KATHLEEN DOHENY

THE END OF AN ERA AT UNION STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following the buttery smell of popping popcorn wafting into the majestic, 
marble-floored hall of Union Station, Metrolink conductor David Tellez entered 
McCarthy's newsstand one day last week and ordered a bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be 10 minutes," cashier Phan Long told him. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, I'll hold the train," Tellez joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Long broke the bad news: 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you know we're closing this week?" 
</P>
<P>
 Only a month earlier, the McCarthys learned their lease had been terminated 
and they would have to close their store on New Year's Eve after 20 years of 
selling newspapers, candy, popcorn, lottery tickets and train memorabilia at 
the station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like a meeting place," Tellez said. "It's sort of like Mayberry. 
It's like Floyd's barber shop. You come in here, play a little bit of keno, 
talk to the help." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuttle driver Charlie Crummer had been stopping by McCarthy's for a year, 
since Metrolink boosted traffic through the station. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have super popcorn," he said. "People are really going to be up in arms 
if they don't continue having (it). I'll miss the service. It's sort of part of 
the place, part of the ambience." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary McCarthy opened the stand and a restaurant in Union Station with her late 
husband, Justin, in 1974. Their son Sean now co-manages the business with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we came in, mostly there were rats and cockroaches here," recalled Mary, 
75. "We put a lot into this station. We completely remodeled the counters, we 
put new walls in. There weren't even lights when we came." 
</P>
<P>
 The stand slogged along through two decades of stagnant rail traffic, but 
business began to improve in 1993 with the advent of the Metrolink commuter 
trains and Metro Rail subway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been here through some real hard times," said Sean, 35. "Now that 
things are going to pick up, they're throwing us out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few days before Friday's closure, McCarthy's displayed dozens of fragrant 
cedar boxes, each overlaid with a photo of the elegant station hall, and a sign 
advertising a two-for-one special. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have one of them," Mary McCarthy offered a regular customer. "I ordered these 
before we knew we were closing and now I'm trying to get rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides snacks, newspapers and sundries, the shop carried an impressive 
collection of train memorabilia. Along with magazines from Mad to Playgirl are 
a half-dozen train journals. A glass case displays train medallions, and on a 
wall are samples of the 847 different train badges for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a whole bunch of books printed up last year called 'Last of the Great 
Stations,' " about the history of Union Station, she said. They're just lying 
in a warehouse now. "Those kinds of things are hard to sell in San Francisco or 
Oakland." 
</P>
<P>
 The McCarthy family has been running newsstands in California since 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 The first stand, on the Oakland ferry boat The Klamath, closed in 1936 when 
the opening of the Bay Bridge killed off ferry service across the bay. A stand 
at the Pacific Electric building in Downtown Los Angeles went out of business 
with the closure of the Red Car trolley line. And a second Bay Area operation, 
open since 1938 in the Oakland train station, shut in February after the 
building was condemned because of damage from a 1989 earthquake. A stand in San 
Jose is still operating. 
</P>
<P>
 The business would seem to be a natural for Mary McCarthy, the daughter of a 
railroad man. She remembers her awe at seeing the first refrigerator cars in 
the 1920s, and watching workers unload elephants and lions when the circus came 
to her hometown of Joplin, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, travelers at the station sometimes rely on her for information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know the history of this station?" asked David Ihlenfeldt, out from 
Milwaukee for the Rose Bowl game with his wife, Elly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know quite a lot," McCarthy answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just arguing about the seats in the hall," he said. "I said they 
would have had wooden seats originally." 
</P>
<P>
 But his wife insisted the plush, padded seats are original. "They used to put 
class in these places," she argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary resolved the dispute. "They're original." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The store's closure is part of a plan by the station's owners, Catellus 
Development Corp., to attract new businesses. The McCarthys will continue to 
operate their restaurant in the station, but a bagel and cappuccino shop will 
take the place of the newsstand, and Eastern Lobby Shops, a national retailer, 
will open a news kiosk nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Hess, director of marketing for Catellus, said turning the news 
operation over to a company that is nationally recognized will attract other 
businesses to the station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to be able to lure in and attract some of these better-known 
retailers," he said. "We're looking for one that will bring an awareness to 
other tenants." 
</P>
<P>
 The change has been a source of contention between Catellus and the McCarthys. 
Hess said that when the McCarthys' lease ended in 1991 they expressed little 
interest in continuing the operation, saying it was unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we spoke to the McCarthys about the newsstand, they always told us it 
wasn't a profit-maker for them," he said. "We were led to believe that they 
weren't interested in remaining in the space." 
</P>
<P>
 The lease was extended on a month-to-month basis and finally terminated in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 The McCarthys, however, said that while they knew their lease was up, they 
expected to receive another site for the newsstand. They denied ever telling 
Catellus that the shop was unprofitable, or that they no longer wanted to run 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there will be another place to buy reading material -- possibly 
within a week, Hess said -- for some of the McCarthys' customers, it won't be 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I'm going to do without them," said Beverly Smith, who has 
commuted with her mother from San Diego every day for two years. "We depend on 
this shop every day. And they always greet us with a bright smile."

A SHARED SUCCESS; AS CHAUMANIX DUTTON STUDIES, A SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY PRAYS. 
HER SUCCESS AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL 3,000 MILES AWAY PROVIDES INSPIRATION BACK 
HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At a recent holiday Mass in South-Central Los Angeles, Ida Coleman stood 
during prayers of the faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the Lord will bless Chaumanix Dutton while she's away from us," 
Coleman said as Christmas lights blinked in the 68-year-old Nativity Church. 
"And that there are those who will extend themselves to her and that she will 
not be lonely." 
</P>
<P>
 Another worshiper prayed "for students who inspire us and who teach us." 
Others simply hugged Chaumanix. 
</P>
<P>
 The ninth grader had just returned from her first three months at Berkshire 
School, a private prep academy on 500 acres of rolling hills in the corner of 
western Massachusetts. She received a $21,000-a-year scholarship to attend.  
</P>
<P>
 As Chaumanix and her mother, Sophia Berkley, were leaving the church after the 
service, parishioner Marilyn Everett asked how the 14-year-old was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is she a straight-A student?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Berkley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right!" Everett hugged Chaumanix tightly. "I'm so happy and pleased. God 
bless you." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, 75 family members, friends, parishioners and former teachers sent 
Chaumanix off to Massachusetts with a party in the parish auditorium. Home at 
Thanksgiving, she was treated as a celebrity as she visited local campuses for 
three days to tell junior high students and teachers about her opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaumanix flew back to campus Monday with a 4.0 average in classes including 
biology, English, Spanish, advanced geometry and ancient history. All those 
good wishes seem to have been realized. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is an inspiration," says Paul Scibetta, a school vice principal who 
arranged her scholarship. "The kids look at this minority student who was once 
part of their group and see that you can basically survive in this world and 
reach heights that were not even part of their reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Educators at Berkshire, where Chaumanix arrived last fall at age 13, hail her 
as bright, efficient and enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a great kid," says Melissa Livsey, head of the dormitory where 
Chaumanix lives. "She's always in a good mood and seems very grateful she's 
here. She's pretty efficient with her time. I think she works very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a very mature kid. I never would have guessed that she was only 13 when 
she arrived. She's not one that needs to please everyone and go along with the 
crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaumanix says she likes "the people at the school, because they're outgoing 
and try to help you, and the environment, because it's very beautiful." The 
scenic campus was founded in 1907 on a former farm four miles south of 
Sheffield. A 2,200-foot mountain overlooks the school and deer frequently 
congregate nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaumanix says she is also comfortable in a student body that's only about 5% 
African American because she studied in similar situations in Los Angeles 
magnet programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless some things required getting used to when she ventured 3,000 
miles from home. 
</P>
<P>
 The day she arrived on campus with her mother, she heard a noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's that?" Chaumanix asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind in the trees," Berkley replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaumanix was accustomed to strong winds being stirred by helicopters, she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 She found she doesn't like the cold, windy snowfall and that the cold, fresh 
air irritates her nose. She discovered thermal underwear and acquired lots of 
warm socks. 
</P>
<P>
 And she worried about extra expenses. During her first few months at school 
Chaumanix called home regularly. But after seeing her mother's phone bill in at 
Thanksgiving, Chaumanix returned to school and didn't call for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going crazy," said Berkley, who is raising Chaumanix and two sons, 12 
and 9, on her salary as an administrative assistant at a child-care agency. "I 
called everywhere for her. When I reached her, I asked was she not calling 
because of the phone bill. She said was trying to help save money. I said don't 
ever do that. You have to call. You're supposed to call. You can call and talk 
as long as you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaumanix's closeness to her family was one reason she wasn't interested in 
the scholarship when she heard about it last year as an eighth grader at 
Belvedere Junior High in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main concern was homesickness," Chaumanix says. "My mom and I are really 
close. I don't tell her everything, but I do tell her a lot. And I hadn't been 
away from home. I thought it might be too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I decided it might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Once I got 
accepted, I was just excited about going." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother went through a similar debate about Chaumanix leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "The serious factors included that she would be 3,000 miles away and that I 
would miss out on a lot," Berkley said. "I'd miss her first date. Her first 
love. Her first rejection or failure, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the teen years I would not be able to be there and read her every day 
and see what need was there that the maternal part of me could help. I would 
lose my ability to protect her daily situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though she'll always have a home and I'll always be here, I knew that 
once she left she would never be back. She would leave here a 13-year-old and 
come back a woman. It was not an easy decision." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end Berkley decided the opportunity was too great to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "This opportunity is afforded not only to few black kids but to few kids," she 
says. "I was so happy when I took her to campus. It was a total learning 
environment and such a beautiful place." 
</P>
<P>
 Over a decade Scibetta, now at Walter Reed Junior High in North Hollywood, has 
arranged scholarships at Eastern high schools for 30 minority students, 
including three others now at Berkshire. 
</P>
<P>
 Berkley, 46, who graduated from Centennial High School in Compton and attended 
Compton College for three semesters, has been separated from the children's 
father for four years. She has raised her family through "a lot of juggling," 
she says in her rented three-bedroom home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refinished my dining table myself. I can reupholster and paint. You learn 
how to fix leaky faucets. You sharpen your survival skills the same way 
millions of other people have been able to." 
</P>
<P>
 She's concerned about children growing up in her neighborhood, where iron bars 
cover doors and windows of aging homes and businesses are littered with 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But she didn't send Chaumanix to Berkshire to get her out of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we lived in the White House, this would be the opportunity of a lifetime," 
says Berkley, whose two sons are also excellent students. 
</P>
<P>
 Berkley says she had two concerns about her daughter's exclusive education. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my concerns was that I didn't want going to a fancy boarding school 
back East to make Chaumanix lose touch with where she came from and become 
lulled into a false sense of the world. I didn't want her to ever forget there 
are people who are in need. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell her that people died to create these kinds of opportunities, and don't 
you ever forget that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other was I do not want it to appear that I have a secret or we're the 
perfect family. All my kids have normal needs, normal activities and normal 
ways of making their mother crazy. It's so easy to look at somebody and say 
she's got all the answers, and I don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the answers, maybe, but many people caring for her family. Sister 
Dolores Pardini, principal of the Sunday school at Nativity parish, attended 
the summer party for Chaumanix before she left for school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could tell from the speeches that there were a lot of people who thought 
very highly of Chaumanix and were praying for her success," Pardini said. "She 
didn't just get the scholarship. This was a culmination of many years of 
support."

PERSONAL HEALTH; BIG FIGHTS FOR '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Women's Health Initiative: The largest research study ever funded by the 
National Institutes of Health may be headed for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, involving 160,000 women and 14 years of work, was designed to make 
up for years of neglect on women's health. But in November, a committee of the 
Institute of Medicine expressed great skepticism in the merits of the study, 
setting up a battle this year that might curb the ambitious effort. The 
Institute of Medicine was asked by the Congress to analyze the study after 
concerns emerged over its size, complexity and cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is supposed to test strategies to prevent breast cancer, 
cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. The Institute of Medicine's biggest 
criticism was of the part of the study that seeks to determine whether a 
low-fat diet reduces the risk of breast and colon/rectal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health Care Reform: While a comprehensive national health plan may not go 
into effect until 1995, the fighting will begin in earnest this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, many other changes will take place this year as industry 
prepares for the inevitable. Look for mergers galore among hospitals, doctors 
and health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vitamin Supplements: The war between the Food and Drug Administration and 
vitamin manufacturers will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA announced last month that dietary supplements will remain widely 
available, but said that it will soon regulate claims on the labels for the 
first time. Expect continued protest from the industry. "Once those regulations 
go into effect, dietary supplement consumers will be put in the dark about the 
benefits of dietary supplements . . ." said Jerry Kessler, president of the 
Nutritional Health Alliance in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * Breast Implants: Will the FDA bow to pressure on breast implants? After 
placing a moratorium on the use of silicone breast implants, except as part of 
a federal study, the FDA is under pressure to reverse itself and allow 
unregulated use of the products. 
</P>
<P>
 In a December issue of the Journal of the American Medical Assn., AMA experts 
blasted the FDA's caution on implants and said: "This anxiety is not warranted 
based on current scientific events." The AMA said it supports continued use of 
implants for reconstruction and augmentation. 
</P>
<P>
 But research on the potential dangers of breast implants is highly 
contradictory. And FDA Commissioner David Kessler, responding in same issue, 
said the AMA's position fails to acknowledge physicians' responsibility to 
provide patients with adequate information. 
</P>
<P>
 In an editorial, JAMA editor George D. Lundberg said: "The resulting brouhaha 
should be interesting. In the silicone mess, there's plenty of blame to go 
around."

THE 'POOPS' SCOOP; THE FRANK, POLITELY ILLUSTRATED BOOK, WHICH SOLD OUT QUICKLY 
AT A BREA STORE, IS INTENDED FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE TOILET-TRAINING. BUT IT HAS 
BECOME UNEXPECTEDLY POPULAR WITH ADULTS TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 One of the hot-selling books regionally and across the country right now is 
about, well, poop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone Poops" (Kane/Miller, $11.95), written and illustrated by Japanese 
author and illustrator Taro Gomi, has become an unexpected favorite among kids 
and adults alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tells how elephants have big poops and other animals have very small 
poops. That's it. It's great for kids who are starting to ask questions," said 
Sue Painter,manager of Nature Co.'s Brea Mall store, which quickly sold its 
allotment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kane/Miller Book Publishers, a small family-owned publisher with offices in La 
Jolla and New York, printed 20,000 copies of the 28-page illustrated book in 
October. The company rushed a second printing of 20,000 copies to stores when 
the first unexpectedly sold out. A third printing of at least 40,000 copies 
will be completed this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Kane/Miller co-owner Madeline Kane is mystified by the book's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would do pretty good," said Kane, who, along with a brother, 
Sandy Miller, specializes in children's books from other countries. "But it's 
been phenomenal for us. A good-selling book will do about 10,000 copies in a 
year, and this has sold 40,000 since October." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Everyone Poops" is intended for children of toilet-training age, 
it's also great for adults who have to answer those questions, said Karin 
Soderberg,a nurse with Kaiser Permanente in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Soderberg purchased one copy for two nephews who are toilet-training. Doctors 
and nurses at Kaiser's pediatric gastroenterology unit use a copy to help 
explain bowel movements and gastrointestinal ailments to children. Kane said 
the book is being used in nursery schools and to help children with learning 
disabilities to better understand their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The book has had other, unintended uses. "It makes the kids who are getting 
chemotherapy treatment laugh because it's funny," Soderberg said. "It's also a 
great conversation piece. I had it in the elevator the other day, and three 
doctors who I don't even know were grabbing it to read." 
</P>
<P>
 The politely illustrated book is "a beginning science book that really 
addresses the needs and interests of the very young child," Kane said. "Since 
we all eat, we all must poop. And it's this basic message that this wonderful 
book presents in a form that is both humorous and informative." 
</P>
<P>
 Gomi specializes in Japanese children's books that have become known for their 
colorful and bold illustrations. Gomi's technique "is just perfect for this 
particular title," Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Everyone Poops" is definitely a kids' book, it has also found an 
unexpected audience among adults. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco's Herb Caen mentioned the toilet-training tome in a recent 
column. Alan Cheuse,a book reviewer in Washington, D.C., told National Public 
Radio's Noah Adams that the cover sells itself: "It's one of those titles that 
tells you everything you need to know about the book." 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times review in June noted that "Taro Gomi's title says it all, 
and the illustrations show it. There's no puritanical, lips-pursed, 
grin-and-bear-it earnestness about the story." 
</P>
<P>
 A second title in a planned series on children and their bodies -- "The Holes 
in Your Nose," by another Japanese author -- will be published in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Kane was taken aback by adult interest in the book. "We knew we would do 
really well in the nursery school realm," Kane said. "But we were totally 
shocked at adults buying it for other adults . . . . I really don't know how to 
explain it. It's not normally something people would talk about."

STATE HAS RARE SUCCESS: INCOME EQUALS SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Providing a rare break from what sometimes seems to be an unending string of 
bad budget news, Controller Gray Davis says the state spent about what it 
collected during the fiscal year that concluded last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state ended the year about $3 billion in the red, almost all of 
that amount had been carried over from the previous year, Davis said as he 
released a report on the state government's fiscal condition. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 12 months ending June 30, Davis said, the state spent only $9 million 
more than it took in from taxes -- a tiny deficit in a $40.9-billion general 
fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state essentially broke even last year for the first time in many years," 
Davis said in a statement released by his office. "We are finally beginning to 
live within our means." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the state received more in taxes than it spent on programs was 
the 1988-89 fiscal year, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The controller's report does not mean that the state's fiscal problems are 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit is still there and may grow larger if the economy does not turn 
around. Without higher taxes or lower spending, according to the Commission on 
State Finance, the deficit will grow to nearly $4 billion by the end of the 
1994-95 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is that the state has shifted some of its red ink off of the 
official ledger -- the one measured by Davis -- by borrowing money in private 
markets and lending it to the public schools. A Superior Court judge has ruled 
that the state cannot force the schools to repay those loans, a decision that 
could add to the deficit if it withstands an expected appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The controller's report addresses the year ending in June because it takes 
several months after the end of the fiscal year for all of the state's tax 
receipts and bills to be collected, paid and accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's fiscal situation is akin to that of a family that runs up a big 
credit card bill before gaining control of its spending. Even though they are 
no longer adding to the tab, they still have trouble reducing it because, after 
buying essentials, they never have enough money left over to pay more than the 
finance charge on the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the deficit did not get any bigger is encouraging," Davis said. 
"Unfortunately, the state is still wallowing in a gigantic sea of red ink 
caused by years of deficit spending." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson will have to address these problems and others in the 
proposed budget he is set to unveil Friday. By law, Wilson's proposal must be 
balanced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican governor is expected to propose enough money to keep pace with 
the growth in school enrollments and prison inmate populations, but every other 
state-supported program probably will face proposed reductions. Wilson said he 
will oppose any tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) told reporters Thursday he 
expects "the budget will be on time . . . and balanced without a tax increase." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Wilson faced a gap of about $8 billion between what the state was 
expected to receive in taxes and the amount needed to wipe out the year-end 
deficit, pay for expected growth in programs and rebuild a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Wilson and lawmakers adopted a budget that included about $1.3 
billion in program reductions. The rest of the gap was overcome -- on paper -- 
by delaying repayment of the year-end deficit, using the off-book school loans, 
and shifting property tax revenue from local governments to public education, 
relieving the state of part of its obligation to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 With the fiscal year half over, the program has had mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities and counties, threatened with severe reductions because of the property 
tax shift, were helped in November when voters extended a half-cent sales tax 
surcharge that otherwise would have expired on Dec. 31. The money goes to local 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the state, the most recent estimates show that revenues will exceed 
spending by about $400 million in the current fiscal year, allowing the state 
to take a modest bite out of its ongoing deficit. But if current economic 
trends continue, the budget will again fall out of balance in the fiscal year 
that begins July 1.

BOY FOUND SAFE WITH MAN INVOLVED IN EARLIER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 3-year-old Indio boy, missing since he disappeared from a Downtown video 
arcade on Christmas Day, was safely reunited with his parents Monday -- ending 
a nine-day ordeal for his parents, but posing a tangle of thorny questions for 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that the day laborer who says he found Andrew Rodriguez is the 
same man who was hailed as a hero after he found a missing 4-year-old four 
weeks ago. Detectives are trying to determine if the "hero" kidnaped Andrew, 
Los Angeles Police Lt. Louis Trovato said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was released late Monday because there was not enough evidence to 
charge him, Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Officer Don Cox said, 
adding that the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was not harmed, police said. "He was checked at the hospital and 
everything is OK," Trovato said. "He's fine . . . happy and content, but he 
hasn't been able to tell us anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The man who found Andrew identified himself to authorities as Jose Jimenez 
when he found Matthew Vera, 4, after the child disappeared from the Downtown 
Greyhound bus station Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview two weeks ago, however, the man told The Times that his name 
is Enrique Palma Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew was found Dec. 6 after being missing for 40 hours, and detectives are 
reopening their investigation of that case, Trovato said. A medical examination 
showed that Matthew, like Andrew, had not been sexually molested or otherwise 
harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez called detectives at 7 a.m. Monday, saying he had found Andrew at 
Broadway and 6th Street, Trovato said. "Our main concern is how the gentleman 
discovered the boy," he said. "That gentleman either found him or abducted 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about skepticism that the same man could find two missing children in 
four weeks, Lopez said after he was released: "It's only bingo -- good luck."  
</P>
<P>
 Safe in his mother's arms, Andrew emerged from the LAPD's Central Division 
station shortly after 1 p.m. with his father and several other relatives in 
tow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I feel happy my son is back," said Jesus Rodriguez, the boy's 
father. "I've gone nine days without much sleep."  
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said he asked Andrew about his experience, but "he can't express 
himself. He doesn't speak much." He said the boy could tell him nothing about 
Lopez, the man who brought him to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pico Boulevard and Mullen Avenue, where Lopez and many day laborers 
congregate waiting for work, friends talked recently about the brief celebrity 
the unemployed day laborer had earned from his heroics in finding Matthew. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and his friends told The Times two weeks ago that he was surprised by 
the amount of publicity he received from rescuing Matthew.  
</P>
<P>
 But they said Lopez felt a profound letdown when the television reporters 
stopped coming around and when promises of work failed to materialize. He was 
back where he had started -- an unemployed man, living out of a friend's truck, 
with no future to speak of. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thinks he did a good thing, but he also knows that presented with the 
occasion, any decent person would do the same," said Andres Cabrales, a friend 
who volunteered to take calls from people who wanted to help Lopez.

 "A big list of people have called, talking about jobs and money (and about) 
sending him things, but so far, no one has sent him anything," said Cabrales, 
35, who has been working as a day laborer for 13 years. "The promises never 
came true."  
</P>
<P>
 Lopez in fact lost his steadiest employer, a contractor who would come by in a 
Range Rover and hire him to do interior decoration, because he was too busy 
talking to the media. The contractor found someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez has a bad wrist and cannot do much manual work, his friends said. After 
learning about his disability, several people who had promised Lopez employment 
backed out, Cabrales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was a street vendor in Mexico, and he was trying to get together enough 
money to start selling here, he said in the interview two weeks ago. He said he 
came to Los Angeles from Quintana Roo state, looking for a young Santa Monica 
woman he had met in Mexico. He said he never found her. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said that most nights he slept in a friend's truck.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said that after Lopez found Matthew in December, some people called 
offering him money. Women came by the corner where he looked for work, offering 
food, and a church in Colorado called and asked him to move there. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim businessman Miguel Munoz, 46, who sent Lopez several hundred dollars, 
said Monday: "If a miracle can happen once, it can happen twice. And 
unfortunately, if a bad deed can happen once, it can happen twice. I'm going to 
wait until the evidence comes in to see what this is." 
</P>
<P>
 After Lopez found Matthew, the child told relatives that a man he met at the 
bus station -- a man he called "El Patito," Spanish for the little duck -- took 
him to the beach and to his house to watch television. El Patito also fed and 
bathed him and bought him clothes, Matthew said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy had vanished just after he and his mother, Rosa Sanchez, arrived from 
Stockton to move in with his grandmother in Pacoima. When Matthew was asked 
what he did while he was missing, he told police that he had "walked and 
walked." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew said he fell asleep in a cab with El Patito and was inside a cab with 
the man when El Patito told him that he did not want him anymore and that he 
should go. Police said at the time that El Patito could have been a product of 
the boy's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 No connection has been made between the man Matthew called El Patito and 
Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Rodriguez, whose family had come to Los Angeles for a monthlong holiday 
visit with relatives, disappeared from his father's side at a video arcade in 
the 700 block of South Broadway as his father played a game with the boy's 
older brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, a cook at a Palm Desert restaurant, his wife, Esther, and their two 
boys had gone to the popular shopping district after opening Christmas 
presents. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and relatives blanketed the area near the arcade with flyers 
describing Andrew. An anonymous businessman put up a $25,000 reward for his 
return, and police confirmed that Andrew had been spotted at the Greyhound bus 
station, a few blocks from the arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 At the home just south of Downtown where the Rodriguezes were staying with 
relatives, friends and neighbors gathered Monday afternoon to toast Andrew's 
return with champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle," one woman repeated over and over in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we can say, 'Happy New Year,' " said Albert Suarez of Azusa, Rodriguez's 
brother-in-law.

GARBAGE CANS TEACH A HARD LESSON IN CITY HALL POLITICS; BUREAUCRACY: CATHERINE 
BUMP OFFERED THE LOW BID AND JOBS FOR A RIOT-TORN AREA. THEN SHE RAN INTO THE 
LOBBYISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Garbage cans had been good to Catherine Bump and it looked as though the 
garbage can business was going to get a whole lot better. 
</P>
<P>
 Bump thought she had won a contract to supply the city of Los Angeles with $25 
million worth of plastic cans suitable for pickup by the city's new trucks with 
mechanical arms. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a win-win deal, she figured: As low bidder, she would get the 
contract and the city would get a factory in an economically ailing part of 
South-Central represented by City Councilwoman Rita Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Bump visited Walters' office last spring to discuss prospects for the 
new factory that would lead to 37 jobs, she said she was surprised when the 
councilwoman's staff told her that it would not lobby the city bureaucracy on 
her behalf, but instead put her in touch with a professional lobbyist to help 
her navigate the complexities of doing business with City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a total City Hall virgin," said Bump, who resisted hiring a lobbyist 
and whose bid was thrown out for procedural oversights spotted by a rival's 
lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 Some at City Hall see her loss as evidence of an effective competitive bidding 
process that gives the job to the lowest priced, most qualified contractor. 
Others see it as a sign that the system depends too heavily on lobbyist-lawyer 
intermediaries whose fees cost bidders -- and ultimately the public -- too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bidders seeking major city contracts find it prudent to hire lobbyists or 
attorneys whose job is to make sure their clients' bids are not rejected 
because they have violated some obscure rule. In addition to defending their 
clients' bids, the lobbyists routinely attack the bids of competitors, 
asserting that they have discovered some technical violation or another. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riordan Administration, which says it is committed to making the city more 
"business-friendly," is "trying to cut down the influence of lobbyists at City 
Hall," said Deputy Mayor Michael Keeley. "We would prefer to talk to 
principals." 
</P>
<P>
 But that will be difficult. The multimillion-dollar lobbying industry is an 
integral part of City Hall. More than 350 lobbyists are registered with the 
city Ethics Commission. Many others either do not register or report only a 
portion of their earnings because they say they are functioning as lawyers -- 
not lobbyists. Those who register report earnings of more than $6 million a 
year, with the top 25 accounting for more than $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bump said the recommendation that she hire a lobbyist was unsolicited and she 
was taken aback by it. As a lawyer and businesswoman, she said she felt 
qualified to handle whatever problems came up. "We didn't think we needed a 
lobbyist," she said. "We were the low bidder." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Walters' legislative deputy, Ernie Delgado, said that Bump asked him 
for names of some lobbyists, and that he responded by meeting with a superior 
in the office, then calling Dave Cunningham, a former Los Angeles city 
councilman, and a second lobbyist, and passing along Bump's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Bump didn't even have to call Cunningham; he called her. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham said in an interview that he told her he would want a retainer and 
a trip to the headquarters of Bump's firm's parent company in Germany. Then he 
would talk to people, get points of view across. 
</P>
<P>
 If Bump actually were awarded the contract, she recalled, he said he would 
expect to be paid 25 cents for every garbage can she produced, a fee that would 
have worked out to $145,000. Cunningham did not dispute her recollections. 
</P>
<P>
 Bump said no thanks, remaining committed to the idea that she could do it 
herself. But Bump was soon disqualified from the contract competition because 
of alleged technical deficiencies in her bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur K. Snyder, a former city councilman who represents Bump's closest 
competitor, alleged two flaws in Bump's bid -- an improper bid bond and a 
faulty corporate signature. 
</P>
<P>
 Bump's biggest problem appeared to be the bond -- in effect, a required 
insurance policy promising to pay the city $2.5 million if her firm, Plastopan, 
withdrew its bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond, issued by a German bank, the Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, 
was in a form city officials were unaccustomed to. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Myrtle Dankers issued an opinion that Plastopan's bond 
was credit-worthy and commercially acceptable but did not meet the City Charter 
requirement that it be issued "by a responsible corporate surety company." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Westdeutsche Landesbank is Germany's third-largest bank and was 
promising to pay the city "upon your first written demand," Plastopan officials 
were perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city attorney's office was interpreting "a responsible corporate 
surety company" as one licensed by the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Plastopan officials did not panic, however, because Dankers then advised city 
purchasing agents that it would be OK to accept a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Bump scrambled to arrange for one and the city's purchasing agent informed her 
in writing that it was acceptable. Thus, when she set off for Walters' office, 
Bump said she thought that the bond controversy was behind her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bump said she figured Walters for a natural ally in surmounting whatever 
obstacles lay ahead because of Plastopan's desire to build a factory in 
Walters' district. Snyder's client, Zarn Inc., would have produced the garbage 
cans in Madera, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1992 riots, Walters had proposed a law that gives bidders like 
Plastopan an advantage if they agree to locate their plant in areas hardest hit 
by the riots. For the purposes of the bid, their prices are considered 10% 
lower than they really are. In Plastopan's case, the 10% preference made its 
bid the lowest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walters said in an interview that the integrity of the competitive bidding 
process was even more important than getting a badly needed plant and so, as a 
matter of principle, she kept her hands off. "The idea of the bid is that it's 
supposed to be (conducted on) a level playing field," she said. "I wasn't going 
to lobby for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters said she was upset when she heard that her staff had referred Bump to 
Cunningham. "I understand my staff was attempting to be of service . . . 
because they knew how much we need this plant." But Walters said it was 
improper to refer a specific "expediter, if that's the right word," when there 
are "a lot . . . who do a very good job." 
</P>
<P>
 When she passed on hiring Cunningham, Bump was still so confident that she 
could get the contract that in mid-May she placed an irrevocable order for a 
$2-million machine for the factory. She said it was necessary if the factory 
were to open on time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bump -- still acting without expert advice -- was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The same day Bump said she placed her order for the machine, Snyder wrote to 
City Atty. James K. Hahn on behalf of his client and threatened to sue the city 
if Bump's firm got the award. 
</P>
<P>
 In early June, Assistant City Atty. John F. Haggerty embraced Snyder's point 
that Plastopan should be disqualified because its original bid bond had not met 
city standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Bump was flabbergasted. Haggerty did not even mention the substitute bid bond 
that other city officials had accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 She arranged to meet with Haggerty twice -- once with members of Walters' 
staff, she said, who asked Haggerty to try looking at the situation again. But 
although Haggerty admitted in another memo that he was "not free from doubt," 
he would not budge. Haggerty, who has since retired, said the city officials 
who accepted the substitute bid bond were wrong to have done so. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is technical," he said in an interview. But rules are rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Bump finally concluded she needed an intermediary of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 In asking around City Hall, Bump said she learned that different lobbyists 
were specialists in resolving problems with different city departments or 
officeholders. Since her problem was with the city attorney's office, Bump 
hired Neil Papiano, who had successfully defended a top aide to City Atty. Hahn 
in a city Ethics Commission probe. He describes himself as an attorney, not a 
lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 Bump and her uncle, Barthel Bitsch, who owns Plastopan, said Papiano agreed to 
work for $25,000 down and 20 cents per garbage can, or $116,000, if Bump got 
the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Bump said she was appalled at paying that much. "Here's Papiano conceivably 
walking off with more money than I will," she said, "But what are you going to 
do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Papiano disputed Bump's and Bitsch's version of his fee arrangements, but he 
said California State Bar rules would not allow him to be specific. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder's law firm, meanwhile, continued its offensive, charging that the bid 
submitted by Bump's company was invalid for another reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Plastopan is actually a 30-year-old group of companies, headquartered in 
Germany. The entire Plastopan group made the bid, but the specific corporate 
entity on whose behalf Bump signed was Plastopan North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Plastopan group had more than enough experience turning out 
garbage cans to qualify for the Los Angeles job, Plastopan North America had 
only been a distributor for the group and had no manufacturing experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder contended that the lack of experience by Plastopan North America 
disqualified the bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Haggerty agreed. He said that if contract disputes arose, the city 
could face an unnecessarily difficult collection problem. Other corporate 
entities in the Plastopan group could argue that they were not bound by the 
contract and therefore were not liable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Papiano argued that this was nonsense; the entire Plastopan group was legally 
bound. 
</P>
<P>
 But acting on Haggerty's advice, the public works staff tossed out their draft 
recommendation that the contract go to Plastopan and urged that it go instead 
to Snyder's client, Zarn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Public Works then decided to dodge the threat of lawsuits by 
either Zarn or Plastopan by throwing out all of the bids and extending a 
temporary contract that had earlier been awarded to Zarn. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new bids were opened in mid-December, Bump, to her horror, made 
another error. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer relying on Papiano and determined to shepherd her bid herself, Bump 
forgot to bring the original copy of her bid to the official bid opening in 
City Hall. When she realized she only had copies, she raced out and retrieved 
the original, but was 15 minutes late bringing it back. 
</P>
<P>
 Bump was apparently the low bidder again. That means Los Angeles still might 
get her factory. 
</P>
<P>
 But her failure to produce the original bid on time was immediately challenged 
by the representative of another bidder, who suggested she be disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 That, the bidder was told, will be up to the Board of Public Works.

FAA HAD DATA ON JET WAKE DANGERS IN '91 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The FAA had evidence dating as far back as October, 1991, that Boeing 757s 
caused unusually dangerous wake turbulence, but the agency issued no public 
warning until last month -- after the deaths of 13 people in two plane crashes 
believed to be linked to the B-757 phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake turbulence occurs when a jet slices through the air, leaving a trail of 
horizontal cyclones that spring out from each wingtip. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration had previously said that it was not until 
early last year that it learned of the problem. But documents obtained by The 
Times indicate that the agency was aware of the problem long before FAA 
Administrator David Hinson issued a nationwide directive Dec. 22 that air 
traffic controllers begin issuing "wake turbulence" warnings to pilots landing 
behind B-757s. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the fall of 1991, at least two formal reports on the dangers were given 
to the FAA, in addition to anecdotal evidence gathered from pilots by the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration: 
</P>
<P>
 * In October, 1991, two researchers who conducted wake turbulence studies on 
B-757s at the FAA's request told the agency the plane had caused more 
turbulence than any plane ever tested, even planes nearly four times its size. 
The researchers speculated that the plane's uniquely designed fuel-efficient 
wing may be the cause of the problem. They recommended that the FAA immediately 
require that smaller planes be kept four miles behind B-757s on final approach 
and that further testing be done. 
</P>
<P>
 When the most recent crash believed to be linked to the wake turbulence 
problem occurred -- a Dec. 15 accident involving a twin-engine corporate jet 
carrying two executives of the In-N-Out hamburger chain -- the plane was 
approximately two miles behind a 757 as it prepared to land at John Wayne 
Airport. All five people aboard perished. 
</P>
<P>
 * In October, 1991, Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, the British equivalent 
of the FAA, presented a report at an FAA-sponsored symposium in Washington, 
saying the B-757 had been involved in a higher proportion of wake 
turbulence-related incidents than other aircraft its size. Calling the B-757 an 
anomaly among similar aircraft, the report said, "It is important to address 
the B-757 problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials with the NASA-run Aviation Safety Reporting System, after 
collecting and reviewing B-757 turbulence-related reports from pilots 
nationwide, brought the problem to the FAA's attention twice in 1993 -- once in 
a teleconference call in January, and again in April at the quarterly meeting 
of the FAA's Air Traffic Procedures Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say that we were surprised" by the Santa Ana crash, said William 
Reynard, head of the Aviation Safety Reporting System. "The (conditions) were 
such that we felt there was a high probability that something was going to 
happen. That's why we brought it up in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Broderick, the FAA's associate administrator for regulation and 
certification, acknowledged that the FAA has had the data on B-757 wake 
turbulence, but said there was nothing alarming about it. But with no new 
information other than the two recent crashes, his boss, FAA administrator 
Hinson, issued a bulletin Dec. 22 to the nation's air traffic controllers 
ordering them to give "wake turbulence" warnings to planes landing behind 
B-757s. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick said the agency has begun further testing of the B-757. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Santa Ana accident, eight people were killed in December, 
1992, when a twin-engine jet flew into the wake of a 757 in Billings, Mont., 
and went down. Researchers Leo Garodz and Kirk Clawson said they conducted wake 
turbulence testing on a B-757 for the FAA on Sept. 25 and 26, 1990. The FAA had 
hired the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to do the test. NOAA 
called on Clawson, one of its own researchers, and hired Garodz as a 
consultant. He is a decorated fighter pilot who had been with the FAA's wake 
turbulence program for 20 years before retiring in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were conducted in the NOAA vortex test facility near Idaho Falls, 
Ida., where such testing has been done for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 What Garodz and Clawson found both surprised and alarmed them: The narrow-body 
B-757 appeared to cause more wake turbulence than any plane ever tested by 
NOAA, even military planes 3 1/2 times its size. The B-757's wake speed of 326 
feet per second -- 222 m.p.h. -- was more than the winds generated by Hurricane 
Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the test, which involved flying a B-757 past a 200-foot 
tower equipped with sophisticated electronic equipment, the force of the 
aircraft's wake wrenched the equipment out of its mounting socket -- a first in 
two decades of such testing, the researchers said.  
</P>
<P>
 The researchers issued a draft report of their findings in May, 1991. Although 
they did not submit the final version of the report until January, 1993, they 
presented their results publicly in October, 1991, at the FAA's International 
Conference on Aircraft Wake Vortices in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculating that the unusually high level of turbulence may be linked to the 
B-757's sleek wing and flap design, Garodz and Clawson recommended that smaller 
planes landing behind B-757s be kept four miles behind and that heavier 
aircraft stay three miles behind on final approach. That recommendation and 
another -- that further testing be conducted -- were ignored, the researchers 
said in interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not make (the recommendations) lightly," Clawson said from his home in 
Idaho. "We felt that what the report did was bring it to the FAA's attention. 
But they're the regulatory agency. What happens after the report is up to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick of the FAA cautioned against lending too much weight to the NOAA 
report, saying "people make recommendations about all kinds of things. You have 
to evaluate . . . whether or not they are appropriate or make sense." He said 
the data was not definitive. 
</P>
<P>
 At the October, 1991, symposium where Garodz and Clawson presented their 
findings, the Britain's Civil Aviation Authority also reported on wake 
turbulence, documenting incidents involving the B-757 dating back to the early 
1980s. The British agency noted a disproportionate number of wake 
turbulence-related incidents involving B-757s and advised further study. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1993, a month after the fatal accident in Montana, officials with 
NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System expressed their concerns about the 
problem in a teleconference call with FAA officials, according to Reynard.  
</P>
<P>
 Safety officials brought the subject up again in April at the quarterly 
meeting of the FAA's Air Traffic Controllers Advisory Committee, Reynard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was of a concern to us," he said. "It struck us that here we had this 
information, that we had conveyed it, and nothing happened." 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Broderick said, the FAA could have acted sooner in issuing the 
type of bulletin Hinson issued Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick said neither the Santa Ana nor the Montana crash would have happened 
if the pilots had followed basic rules of airmanship. Pilots are always told to 
fly above the path of a leading jet to stay out of its wake, Broderick said. 
Furthermore, he said, both pilots were flying under visual flight rules, which 
meant the pilots, not air traffic controllers, were responsible for maintaining 
a safe cushion between their planes and the B-757s in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a matter of physics that if in fact a following airplane stays above 
the preceding airplane, the following airplane will never encounter the wake of 
the preceding plane," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other aviation sources say that at a minimum, the FAA was obliged to say what 
it knew about the B-757's dangerous wake turbulence so pilots could take extra 
precautions when landing behind them. At most, some people, including 
researcher Garodz, believe the FAA should have mandated a three- or four-mile 
separation for aircraft landing behind B-757s in all circumstances until it 
conducted further tests. 
</P>
<P>
 A national aviation source who requested anonymity because he works with the 
FAA on rule changes said, "There is kind of a common concern that it often 
takes a catastrophic incident before the FAA does anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese said the B-757 has been in service since 
1982 and only recently has wake turbulence been cited in any accident. Last 
year, she said, the worldwide fleet of 574 B-757s logged 7 million safe hours 
in the air, traveling 2.7 billion miles and making 3.5 million landings. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating both crashes 
in which B-757 turbulence is believed to have been a factor, has asked the 
company for whatever data it has on B-757 wake turbulence, Reese said. She said 
the company is "helping out in the interest of aviation safety."

 You would hardly notice Amit Kumar Prabakhar as he staggers by, his pint-size 
frame bent double under the weight of a suitcase weighing nearly 80 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Amit's profession, if you can call it one, is working as a coolie at Delhi's 
Interstate Bus Terminus. It gets chilly in India's capital in winter, but all 
he wears on his feet are plastic bath clogs. At night, he sleeps on a table. 
</P>
<P>
 For lugging the overstuffed valise of someone bound for Lucknow or Punjab, 
Amit pockets around 60 cents. He is proud of the work he does and of who he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't say that I am poor," he insists, his irregular white teeth flashing. 
"Say that I am from a good family." 
</P>
<P>
 Amit, self-employed baggage porter, is 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody seems to know for sure how many children work in India. Many, like 
Amit, a brave and engaging orphan from a factory town in Uttar Pradesh, are 
runaways and street children who must work just to survive. Some are sold by 
their parents into bondage. Yet others toil in the fields or shops alongside 
family members, who can be among the worst slave-drivers of all.

 "Some say they are invisible. But they are not," says Rita Panicker, director 
of Butterflies, a New Delhi-based private organization that champions the cause 
of child laborers and street children. "We just don't want to see them." 
</P>
<P>
 India's 1991 census found that minors make up 8% of the laboring population. 
Concern for Working Child, a Bangalore-based private group, pegs its estimate 
as high as a mind-boggling 100 million -- more than the entire work force of 
all but a few countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the southern state of Tamil Nadu, 80,000 children, many of whom are only 
10, are employed in the match and fireworks industries. In Orissa, on the Bay 
of Bengal, every 20th child is a worker, most of them girls. 
</P>
<P>
 A Labor Ministry official estimates that 300,000 youngsters work in India's 
carpet industry alone. In Jaipur, 10,000 to 20,000 children do menial tasks 
associated with the cutting and polishing of sapphires, lapis lazuli and other 
gems. On tea plantations, an army of children cull the fragrant leaves for the 
beverage that will show up on European and American breakfast tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian law bars minors from being on the job more than five hours a day. But 
surveys show two-thirds of the country's laboring minors put in eight to 12 
hours each day. 
</P>
<P>
 The average daily income for almost three-quarters of them is 10 rupees -- 
less than 33 U.S. cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Often they are at the physical or sexual mercy of their employer. A Bombay 
entrepreneur forced boys from Tamil Nadu to sell snacks in the bazaar, then 
beat one 8-year-old who tried to escape with hot iron rods and bicycle inner 
tubes so savagely the child died. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bhawan Singh knows plenty about beatings. The pudgy, brown-eyed boy from the 
foothills of the Himalayas becomes unreliably murky when he talks about dates, 
but he thinks he ran away from home at age 8 or 9 when his parents insisted he 
go to school. He stole 200 rupees and boarded a bus for a town he later found 
out was Ghaziabad. There Bhawan worked two years for no pay at a tea shop, 
receiving food in return and sleeping outdoors. If he spilled tea or broke a 
cup, the owner pummeled him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sickened by his life and alone in the world, the boy coaxed a bus driver into 
taking him to nearby Delhi, where Bhawan, now 18, joined one of the largest 
concentrations of working children in the world -- an estimated 400,000, of 
whom 100,000 live on the streets, often alongside homeless parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They must work to survive -- collecting rags, shining shoes, selling 
newspapers, scavenging on rubbish dumps. Many also turn to crime," a U.N. 
Development Program report on street children said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the gritty urban nether world made famous by Mira Nair's stark, 
award-winning 1988 film "Salaam Bombay!" which tells the story of a 10-year-old 
boy who comes to Bombay to earn money and becomes a chaipau , or "one who 
delivers tea and bread," in the red-light district. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act sets no age limit for 
entry into the work force, although hazardous occupations are theoretically off 
limits to children 14 and younger. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian officials have long appeared to distinguish between child labor, which 
arguably is inevitable and even necessary in a country with hundreds of 
millions of poor, and the rank exploitation of children. "A problem like child 
labor cannot be solved overnight," Labor Minister P. A. Sangma has said. 
</P>
<P>
 That mind-set may explain why it took Sangma's ministry six years to prepare 
the draft of a change to India's Minimum Wages Act preventing employers from 
paying children and adolescents less than adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that molasses-paced effort was prompted at least in part by American and 
other overseas threats to boycott imports produced with child labor. One bill 
introduced by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) would empower the Treasury secretary to 
ban the entry of items manufactured, like Indian handwoven carpets, by 
industries employing children. 
</P>
<P>
 India's smallest workers have few allies. When a group of coolies ages 11 to 
15 at Delhi's I.N.A. Market formed a union to try to protect themselves from 
beatings and exploitation by shopkeepers and police alike, the Delhi Registrar 
of Trade Unions refused to legalize it, citing a 1926 law that forbids workers 
under 15 from joining a union. 
</P>
<P>
 As for organized labor, the plight of India's child laborers seems to interest 
it little. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult enough to organize adults. What do you do with children?" 
asked T. A. Francis of the All India Trade Union Congress in a Calcutta 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Panicker, a bespectacled, plump South Indian with a degree in social work who 
has been working on Delhi's streets since 1987, observes: "These children know 
they are being exploited; no one has to tell them that. They know it's not fair 
that others go to school and they don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Delhi's cavernous bus station and its Kiplingesque throngs of hurrying 
passengers in turbans and saris and vendors hawking cigarettes and other wares 
by the light of flaming torches could have been a dead end for Amit and Bhawan, 
if not for Butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 After arriving in India's capital four years ago, Bhawan led a vagabond life 
as a baggage porter, sleeping in the terminal and blowing almost all his meager 
earnings to watch Hindi-language action films and melodramas. 
</P>
<P>
 Today he is the proud supervisor of a unique restaurant outside the terminal 
that was organized by Butterflies and is now run by 10 street children ranging 
in age from 15 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned something," Bhawan says happily one evening as, arms akimbo and 
clad in a dirty red-check shirt, he talks to a visitor over a glass of milky 
tea. "My life is orderly now." 
</P>
<P>
 He makes out bills, lights the coal-fired chula stove inside an oil drum to 
cook flat Indian bread, waits on the seven Formica-topped tables and makes sure 
everybody else does his job. Beginning workers are paid 500 rupees (about $16) 
a month, get free meals and receive medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant has given a sense of belonging to a few of the children who 
used to fend for themselves on Delhi's mean streets. There are even touching 
signs of hope: Garish printed likenesses of Lakshmi, the Hindu religion's 
goddess of fortune, adorn the dirty blue walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "These boys bought all these posters hoping that maybe fortune would come 
calling here," Souparna Lahiri said with a smile. Lahiri is an adult 
Butterflies worker who is investigating whether other businesses should be 
opened to employ children. 
</P>
<P>
 In existence since January, 1988, Butterflies operates out of Panicker's 
second-floor South Delhi apartment on an annual budget of about $50,000 and 
grants from Germany, Holland, France and Indian government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Its 10 "street educators" use the street-lamp-lighted pavements of Delhi as a 
classroom to teach the rudiments of Hindi, English, arithmetic and other basic 
subjects to a total of 285 children, 80% of whom have never seen the inside of 
a school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our second aim is to make them good, true, honest people," says street 
educator Praveen Sherma, a political science graduate from Delhi University. 
</P>
<P>
 Butterflies has eight "contact points" frequented by 500 porters, shoeshine 
boys, ragpickers, flower vendors, tea shop attendants and other child laborers. 
The emphasis is on children organizing and deciding what is important for them, 
and on developing pride and character. 
</P>
<P>
 At the bus station, the coolies decided to gather in the afternoon for class 
because nighttime travelers are too valuable a source of tips for them to pass 
up. Amit, who had already spent seven years in school, can read some of an 
English-language newspaper thanks to street schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the aegis of Butterflies, the Interstate Bus Terminus porters have also 
organized their own union. One Friday night, clad in cloaks and dirty shirts of 
various shades of sepia, gray and black, they assembled in the restaurant under 
Panicker's gaze to discuss whether to admit another category of child worker, 
the bootblacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The union is no panacea for its members' problems. One youngster, Jasbir 
Singh, almost died after sleeping overnight on an outdoor bus platform. Only 
two coolies are participating in a savings plan that requires a minimum deposit 
of just 6 cents. Deploring poor attendance, the boys who have come to the 
Friday meeting vote to require all other members to attend in the future, or 
face expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 In what by all accounts is a historic first in India, a group of children 
helped by Butterflies took their cause all the way to the Supreme Court -- and 
won a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Delhi judge last August upheld the refusal of the Registrar of Trade 
Unions to authorize the Bal Mazdoor (Child Labor) Union, Butterflies, with the 
help of Soli J. Sorabjee, India's former solicitor general, lodged an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court now has ordered India's government to explain, in effect, 
why it believes children should be allowed to work like adults but not to 
organize to defend their interests. Court proceedings are scheduled to start 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian officials have begun talking about the need to bring about a phased end 
to child labor. Meanwhile, the Harkin bill and a grass-roots drive in Germany 
to boycott imported carpets woven by children have made New Delhi 
supersensitive to the potential costs in lost export earnings of the continued 
exploitation of children. 
</P>
<P>
 But statistics and experience show real improvement still lies in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the movie 'Salaam Bombay!' made people sensitive to these kids," says 
Panicker, 38, who is married but childless. "But there is no concern that goes 
beyond sympathy, to the point of feeling anger and shame and therefore wanting 
to do something. People don't see this as a great scandal."

MEETINGS BEGIN ON POSSIBLE MERGER OF FEDERATED, MACY; FINANCE: COMBINED FIRM 
WOULD CREATE NATION'S LARGEST DEPARTMENT STORE CHAIN, INTENSIFY STATE'S 
COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of the nation's biggest department store chains opened discussions Monday 
on a possible merger that could create a dominant new national force in 
retailing and further intensify California's cutthroat competitive environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although New York-based R. H. Macy & Co. said it would be premature to comment 
on a possible merger with Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores, many 
analysts said they believe a combination -- which would create the nation's 
largest department store chain -- will happen because the two companies have 
compelling reasons to get together. 
</P>
<P>
 Big department stores have been struggling in recent years from fierce 
competition from discount chains and specialty stores. Some chains have closed 
stores and others have combined operations to save money. For example, Los 
Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores, which operates The Broadway chain, has 
consolidated some support operations and May Department Stores recently merged 
its Robinsons and May Co. chains. 
</P>
<P>
 A merger would help Macy and Federated compete more effectively by lowering 
their expenses and giving them increased bargaining power with suppliers. 
Savings could be passed along to consumers in lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination with Federated could also allow Macy to emerge more quickly from 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection. It also could offer a marked contrast 
to the merger mania of the 1980s when department stores gobbled up each other 
to gain market share. Now the chains are combining operations to survive the 
competitive onslaught from discount stores such as Wal-Mart and specialty 
apparel stores. 
</P>
<P>
 For Federated, which owns Bloomingdale's and other chains, a major goal of a 
merger would be to get a base in California, where Macy operates the Bullock's 
and I. Magnin chains. 
</P>
<P>
 "One way or the other, a merger is likely because it would be in the best 
interests of both companies," said Kurt Barnard, a New York-based retail 
economist. "Federated needs to expand, and it's imperative that they get a 
foothold in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Walter Loeb, a New York-based retail analyst: "Major department stores 
can continue to operate successfully only by expanding their revenue base -- 
and a merger is one way to accomplish that." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Federated once had a California presence through Bullock's, none of 
its chains -- Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Strauss, the Bon Marche, Burdines, 
Goldsmith's, Jordan Marsh, Lazarus, Rich's and Stern's -- have stores in 
California, the most populous state and home to some of the nation's most 
lucrative retail markets. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, nearly half of Macy's 111 Macy and Bullock's department 
stores are in California. Macy also has 11 of its 12 I. Magnin stores here. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated executives have said they would like to establish Bloomingdale's, 
its most prestigious nameplate, in California. Such an opening might be easier 
if the company controlled leases on current stores in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of Macy and Federated would create problems for May and Carter 
Hawley Hale because the merged company could acquire products cheaper and 
challenge its competitors by lowering the prices on that merchandise, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated publicly raised the idea of a merger with Macy on Sunday when it 
disclosed that it had bought half of the Macy debt held by the Prudential 
Insurance Co. Federated would become Macy's largest creditor -- with 15% of the 
total debt -- if it exercises an option to buy the other half of Prudential's 
secured claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase gives Federated a seat at the bargaining table in Macy's 
two-year-old Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and is the first step in a 
friendly bid for control of Macy. If Macy rejects a friendly merger, Federated 
could launch a successful hostile bid for control, legal experts and industry 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Federated is in a very strong position, and Macy will likely be forced to 
accept a merger," said Marc Beilinson, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who 
specializes in bankruptcies at the Los Angeles law offices of Pachulski, 
Stange, Ziehl & Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated could launch a hostile bid by proposing that the secured claims of 
creditors be converted to equity ownership in Macy, Beilinson said. If one-half 
of the creditors approve that plan -- and if those creditors control two-thirds 
of the total debt -- secured creditors could seize control of the company, 
Beilinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy said it was premature to comment on the notion of a merger and Chairman 
Myron E. Ullman stressed that the company was focusing most heavily on its 
reorganization plan -- not merger talks. He said Macy would discuss the 
company's reorganization options with all creditors -- including Federated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since beginning the reorganization process nearly two years ago, we have 
focused on restructuring the company's operations," Ullman said. "We have made 
good progress in implementing our business plan and are aggressively continuing 
the rebuilding process." 
</P>
<P>
 Federated was upbeat about the reaction of the Macy team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very professional and receptive to exploring the idea of a merger, 
and the meeting ended with the clear understanding that the two sides will be 
talking again," said Federated spokeswoman Carol Sanger. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanger said Federated would be developing a specific merger proposal and would 
discuss its ideas with other major Macy creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 News of a possible merger sent Federated shares up $2 to close at $22.75 in 
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Meantime, Macy's 14 1/2% 
bonds due 1998 rose to $510 per $1,000 bond from $422.50 last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Away from the financial markets, Washington also took seriously the idea of a 
merger between the two retail giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) asked the Justice Department and the 
Federal Trade Commission to examine whether a merger could hurt competition in 
the retailing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 A Federated-Macy union would create a department store company with 330 
stores, surpassing May Department Stores Co., which owns 312 stores and is 
currently the nation's largest. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated's move represents a reversal of fortunes for itself and Macy. In 
1988, Macy was an unsuccessful bidder to buy Federated. Federated was acquired 
later that year by Canadian businessman Robert Campeau. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Campeau takeover, Federated sold its I. Magnin and Bullock's store 
groups in California to Macy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Federated chief Allen I. Questrom was chairman of Bullock's when it 
was controlled by Federated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given Questrom's familiarity with California, he might see opportunities in 
the state," said an executive at a competing retailing firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Campeau's real estate and retailing empire unraveled and sent Federated into 
Chapter 11. Federated emerged as a reorganized company in 1992 and is now one 
of the nation's strongest retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's financial troubles started in 1986 when it amassed an enormous debt in 
a leveraged buyout by management. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether a Federated-Macy marriage is consummated, analysts said 
they expect more mergers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been massive consolidation in retailing -- including the department 
store sector -- and that will probably continue," said Ira Kalish, a retail 
economist at the Los Angeles offices of Management Horizons, a division of 
Price Waterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalish cited the recent merger of Price Co. and Costco -- two warehouse store 
giants -- and the expansion of the Little Rock-based Dillard Department Stores, 
which has been acquiring smaller chains in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advantage of acquisitions is you get a franchise that is established in 
(the) eyes of (the) consumer as opposed to building a new store, which entails 
more risk," Kalish said. The Nation's Best Sellers The nation's top retailers

TOLL TOPS 100 IN MEXICO REBELLION; LATIN AMERICA: FIGHTING CONTINUES BETWEEN 
ARMY AND INDIAN GUERRILLAS, WHO HAVE ABANDONED SEVERAL TOWNS THEY CAPTURED. 
PRESIDENT CALLS FOR AN END TO VIOLENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 The death count exceeded 100 Monday on the third day of fighting between the 
army and Indian guerrillas who have captured and largely abandoned eight towns 
in the southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrillas also have reportedly kidnaped the former state governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's three Roman Catholic bishops are offering to serve as mediators 
between the government and the Zapatista National Liberation Army, as the 
guerrillas call themselves. The rebels are demanding better living conditions 
and democracy for the inhabitants of the impoverished, largely indigenous state 
on the border with Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari called for an end to the violence and for 
unity among citizens to confront the nation's problems. During a ceremony at 
the presidential palace, he acknowledged that his economic reform program has 
not yet benefited all sectors of Mexican society. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that needs and inequalities persist," Salinas told legislators. "We 
know that benefits and opportunities still are not tangible realities for 
many." 
</P>
<P>
 The economic reform program, particularly the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, which took effect Jan. 1 -- the day the crisis began -- was 
criticized by the guerrillas on Sunday in a lengthy declaration of war. 
</P>
<P>
 They said that NAFTA, an agreement among the United States, Mexico and Canada 
to eliminate trade barriers over a 15-year period, is an example of growing 
foreign influence in their country and an economic policy that favors the rich. 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrillas also oppose U.S. training of Mexican soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Rojas, the new social development minister, said in a Mexico City news 
conference that Chiapas has received more money than any other state from the 
Solidarity poverty alleviation program. 
</P>
<P>
 He announced the creation of a committee of state and federal officials to 
devise projects to address the state's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, federal spending in Chiapas has risen more than tenfold in the past 
five years to $250 million last year, Socorro Diaz, undersecretary of the 
interior, told reporters in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz said the guerrillas are "influenced and manipulated" by similar Central 
American groups. The Indians have denied any foreign ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz acknowledged that the government had received information about arms 
smuggling and military training camps on the Guatemalan border in the final 
months of last year. As recently as November, officials in her ministry were 
denying the existence of guerrilla groups here. 
</P>
<P>
 "A longstanding backwardness in the area obligated us to act with extra 
prudence and caution," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 A military spokesman in Guatemala said that the government had not ruled out 
the possibility that members of the leftist Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unit were helping the Mexican guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 And one rebel leader told Mexico's official news agency, Notimex, that the 
Zapatistas had trained in the jungle in Chiapas, which borders Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the government increased security forces in Guerrero, another 
southern state that was the base of operations for guerrilla groups wiped out 
two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiapas guerrillas have withdrawn from at least three of the five towns 
captured New Year's Day, including this tourist center, the state's 
second-largest city. But they have captured three new towns: Oxchuc, Huixtla 
and Guadalupe Tepeyac. 
</P>
<P>
 Altamirano, one of the towns originally invaded, is believed to still be under 
guerrilla control. But it was not clear late Monday who controlled Ocosingo. 
Guerrillas still had a roadblock leading to the town but told reporters that 
they had decided to withdraw, although the army had not claimed to have 
regained Ocosingo. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican reporters who tried to enter Huixtla said they were captured by a 
group claiming to be part of the guerrilla movement and were charged a $230 
"war tax" to be set free. 
</P>
<P>
 The niece of Absalon Castellanos, governor of the state from 1982 to 1988, 
claimed that he was kidnaped by guerrillas at his ranch 22 miles east of 
Comitan, another tourist attraction that the rebels have said they intend to 
invade. Castellanos is also the former Chiapas regional army commander. 
</P>
<P>
 He was reportedly put in his own truck and driven toward the Lacandon jungle, 
where the guerrillas are believed to have trained. 
</P>
<P>
 Casualties on Monday included journalist Ismael Romero of the Mexico City 
daily La Jornada, who was shot in the shoulder at a military checkpoint outside 
San Cristobal. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Embassy sent five representatives to Chiapas on Monday to help 
Americans find safety or a way out if they chose. It was not known how many 
Americans were in the state, a popular tourist destination for its scenery and 
traditional architecture and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's three bishops renewed their call for an end to the violence and 
repeated their offer to act as mediators. Rojas, who was once a peasant 
organizer in the state, is said to have spoken with the bishops, but the 
content of their conversation was not revealed.

 Relations between church and government have been rocky in Chiapas, largely 
because of San Cristobal de las Casas Bishop Samuel Ruiz's staunch defense of 
human rights for Indians in the state.

 The rebels claim their numbers run into the thousands; the government says 
there are only a couple hundred. However, witnesses said their attacks seemed

</P>
<P>
 Lacandon and other Indian peoples in Chiapas state have long been feuding with 
state and federal authorities, often over land. They complain that lumberers, 
land sharks and cattle ranches increasingly are encroaching on their native 
habitat, the rain forest, and that the government is doing little to help. 
People and Location

<P>
 Most of Chiapas' people are at least part Indian, and many areas carry on the 
customs of their ancestors. Potentially rich in natural resources, including 
oil, Chiapas nonetheless remains one of Mexico's poorest states.

WHITE HOUSE TO SEEK GUN DEALER FEE OF $600 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aiming to reduce the number of gun dealers in the nation by 80%, the Clinton 
Administration today will propose hiking annual licensing fees to $600, nearly 
10 times higher than the level under the recently enacted Brady bill gun 
control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is one of several weapon control measures that Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen will propose in keeping with President Clinton's pledge to push 
for steps beyond those in the Brady bill and in the anti-crime legislation 
approved by both houses of Congress and now awaiting action by House-Senate 
conferees.  
</P>
<P>
 Since 1968, dealers have paid $30 for a three-year license. The license allows 
the holder to purchase weapons at wholesale, to avoid state and local taxes, 
and to ship guns across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brady bill, which also imposes a five-day waiting period for handgun 
purchases, raised the three-year fee to $200 for new applicants, with a $90 
renewal fee. The bill was named for James S. Brady, President Ronald Reagan's 
press secretary who was severely wounded in the March, 1981, attempt to 
assassinate Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the White House as well as many former congressional 
opponents of gun control have recognized that the views of many Americans have 
changed in the face of mounting violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress and the Administration seized on the new mood and pressed for tougher 
language in the anti-crime legislation than was thought possible earlier in the 
year. The legislation includes provisions to build more prisons, stiffen 
sentences for gun-wielding criminals, hire 100,000 more police officers for the 
nation's streets and ban the manufacture, sale or possession of assault 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory behind the sharp increase in license fees is that only 20% of the 
more than 284,000 gun dealers nationwide are genuinely engaged in the sale of 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Others buy licenses only to help them obtain weapons for their own use at 
lower costs. They have no intention of selling weapons as retailers, Treasury 
Department officials said. As a result, federal inspectors have greater 
difficulty policing the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen, who is becoming the Administration's point man on stiffer gun 
controls, will announce the initiatives in a speech at an awards ceremony at 
the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. He also is expected to call for 
requiring a federal permit for the purchase of explosives, to make the theft of 
explosives a felony and to outlaw the purchase of explosives by convicted 
felons. Federal permits are required now only if the explosives cross state 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 A Treasury official, who declined to be named, insisted that the $600 license 
fee "is only the cost of administering the licensing program." 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury official cited a survey conducted last year which found that 70% 
of the license holders did not own stores and that an overwhelming number were 
not buying and selling enough firearms to meet the statutory definition of a 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those surveyed by Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
had no guns in their inventory for the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Those circumstances exist largely because the agency's 240 inspectors do not 
provide enough manpower to police the licensees. The proliferation of license 
holders also has resulted in shoddy record keeping, thwarting attempts by 
authorities to trace firearms, according to the officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A National Rifle Assn. lobbyist, however, contended that the proposed higher 
fee is "entirely unjustified" and amounts to about five times the cost of 
processing the license. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Secretary Bentsen is doing is just another example of attempting to 
recover the cost of criminal investigations by jacking up the price the 
law-abiding firearms dealers have to pay," the lobbyist, Joe Phillips, told the 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's proposal faces difficulty in Congress, an aide to a leading House 
Democrat said. "It's going to be uphill because the gun lobby hates it, but 
maybe it will be easier than it has been in past years." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Treasury Department official said the Administration believes that 
"the time is ripe" for enactment of the higher fees and related measures, 
citing the decision by leading retailers, such as Wal-Mart, to curtail their 
firearms business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the country's mood is changing," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen also will announce steps to increase the number of ATF firearms dealer 
inspectors and to enhance the bureau's computer record-keeping to make tracing 
easier, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Bentsen's proposals, the ATF also would be given stronger authority to 
require dealers to comply with licensing requirements and to share information 
on firearms with state and local police.

JET TAXIED ON PAVEMENT FOR SMALL PLANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A chartered jetliner sank into the asphalt at Van Nuys Airport -- a last-straw 
climax to the Rose Bowl visit of a planeload of irritated Wisconsin football 
fans -- because it had somehow taxied onto pavement too weak to support such a 
large plane, airport officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boeing 727, carrying 137 homesick Badger fans -- who arrived in Southern 
California to discover that the game tickets they paid for had been sold to 
others -- got stuck because its landing gear punched through thin pavement 
meant only for smaller planes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The question was: Why was it there? 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas-based owner of the jet, Express One International, said that 
Federal Aviation Administration controllers in the tower of the city-owned 
airport directed the 727 there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our pilots did not pick that route," said Stephen Thompkins, general council 
for Express One. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like a shopping mall where you take your car and park it anywhere 
you can find. The control tower told the aircraft to proceed to taxiway Echo, 
and that was the only way to get there. When the 727 suddenly started to sink, 
it was as much a surprise to our crew as anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot immediately brought the jet to a stop and no one was hurt in the 
mishap, but the passengers had to be taken off the plane, temporarily housed in 
a hotel, fed, and then late that night bused to Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 They finally left for Madison at 2:30 a.m. Monday, aboard a replacement jet 
flown in from Minneapolis by the tour operator. 
</P>
<P>
 The boarding area used by the jet at Van Nuys Airport is owned by Peterson 
Aviation, a company that provides aircraft services. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson officials did not return calls from The Times, but airport officials 
said the company leases a part of the facility that traditionally has been used 
for airplanes and small jets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically didn't know they were going to have anything as heavy as a 727 
there," said airport manager Ron Kochevar. 
</P>
<P>
 Planes and jets usually serviced by the facility range in weight from about 
6,000 to 75,000 pounds, Kochevar said, while a fully loaded Boeing 727 weighs 
about 160,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch of asphalt, which Kochevar described as a "transitional area" 
between Peterson and the airport's taxiway, is only two or three inches thick. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the trouble is, there is no base under it," as there is under the 
heavier-duty taxiways and runways, Kochevar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport manager said the incident is under investigation, but he thinks 
it's possible that tower controllers were never told by airport administrators 
that the "transitional area" could not handle a heavy jet. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were probably not aware of it," he said. "We had no idea that (Peterson) 
was going to accommodate an aircraft of that size at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 If it is determined that the airport, which is responsible for maintenance of 
the asphalt strip, is at fault, the mishap could end up costing the city. The 
tour operator, Front Page Tours of Minneapolis, footed the bill for the 
replacement jet, the hotel rooms and other expenses caused by the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure at this time who will end up paying," said Dick Page, president 
of the company. "But we'll be talking to everyone involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The airport mishap added insult to injury for the tour passengers, who began 
their weekend holiday in Los Angeles with the news that the Rose Bowl tickets 
they had been promised as part of their tour package would not be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry government officials in Wisconsin have asked state and federal officials 
to investigate the ticket situation that left fans with the unappetizing option 
of paying hundreds of dollars to buy game tickets from scalpers or watch their 
beloved team make its first Rose Bowl appearance in three decades on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Page said that he was glad his company had been contracted only for 
transportation and had nothing to do with the ticket snafu. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to emphasize we had nothing to do with that," he said with an audible 
sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened at the airport was unfortunate, but we made every effort to 
take care of the passengers until we could arrange for a flight to get them 
home."

FAA KNEW OF 757 WAKE DANGER; AVIATION: TESTS IN 1991 SHOWED AIRLINER PRODUCED 
SEVERE TURBULENCE BUT NO PUBLIC WARNING WAS ISSUED UNTIL AFTER O.C. CRASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The FAA had evidence dating as far back as October, 1991, that Boeing 757 
jetliners cause unusually dangerous wake turbulence, but the agency issued no 
public warning until last month -- after the deaths of 13 people in two plane 
crashes believed to have been linked to the 757 phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration had previously said that it had 
indications of the problem since the beginning of last year. But documents 
obtained by The Times indicate that the agency had cause to be concerned long 
before FAA Administrator David Hinson issued a nationwide directive Dec. 22 
that air traffic controllers begin issuing "wake turbulence" warnings to pilots 
landing behind 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake turbulence occurs when a jet slices through the air, leaving a trail of 
horizontal cyclones that spring out from each wingtip. The turbulence can 
violently disrupt the air beneath planes following too closely behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the fall of 1991, at least two formal reports on the potential dangers 
were given to the FAA, in addition to anecdotal evidence gathered from pilots 
by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration: 
</P>
<P>
 * In October, 1991, two researchers who conducted wake turbulence studies on 
757s at the FAA's request told the agency the plane had caused more turbulence 
than any plane ever tested, even aircraft nearly four times its size. The 
researchers speculated that the plane's uniquely designed fuel-efficient wing 
may have been the cause of the problem. They recommended that the FAA 
immediately require smaller planes be kept four miles behind 757s on final 
landing approach and that further testing be done. 
</P>
<P>
 When the most recent crash believed to be linked to the wake turbulence 
problem occurred -- a Dec. 15 crash of a twin-engine corporate jet carrying two 
executives of the In-N-Out burger chain -- the plane was about two miles behind 
the 757 as it prepared to land at John Wayne Airport and then went down. All 
five aboard perished. 
</P>
<P>
 * Also in October, 1991, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority, the 
British equivalent of the FAA, presented a report at an FAA-sponsored symposium 
in Washington, saying the 757 had been involved in a higher proportion of wake 
turbulence-related incidents than other aircraft its size. Calling the 757 an 
"anomaly" among similar aircraft, the report said, "It is important to address 
the 757 problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials with the NASA-run Aviation Safety Reporting System, after 
collecting and reviewing 757 turbulence-related reports from pilots nationwide, 
brought the problem to the FAA's attention twice in 1993: once in a 
teleconference call in January, and again in April at the quarterly meeting of 
the FAA's own Air Traffic Procedures Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say that we were surprised" by the latest crash, William Reynard, 
head of the Aviation Safety Reporting System, said, referring to the Santa Ana 
accident. "The (conditions) were such that we felt there was a high probability 
that something was going to happen. That's why we brought it up in the first 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Broderick, the FAA's associate administrator for regulation and 
certification, acknowledged that the FAA has had the data on 757 wake 
turbulence, but said there was nothing "alarming" about it. However, it was 
with no new information other than the two recent crashes that his boss, FAA 
Administrator Hinson, issued a bulletin Dec. 22 instructing the nation's air 
traffic controllers to give "wake turbulence" warnings to planes landing behind 
757s. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick said the agency also has begun further testing of the 757. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the Santa Ana accident, eight people were killed in December, 1992, 
when a twin-engine jet encountered 757 wake turbulence in Billings, Mont. Both 
crashes remain under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, 
but preliminary reports indicate that 757 wake turbulence played a significant 
role in each. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other incidents in the past year may also have been caused by turbulence 
from 757s, including the November crash of a single-engine Cessna in Salt Lake 
City in which three people were injured, and an instance over Denver in which a 
Boeing 737 experienced an "uncommanded roll" after encountering the wake of a 
757. 
</P>
<P>
 According to researchers Leo Garodz and Kirk Clawson, they did wake turbulence 
testing for the FAA on a 757 on Sept. 25 and 26, 1990. The FAA had hired the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to do the test. NOAA, in turn, 
called on Clawson, one of its own researchers, and hired Garodz, a decorated 
fighter pilot who had been with the FAA's wake turbulence program for 20 years 
before retiring in 1986, as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were conducted in the NOAA vortex test facility near Idaho Falls, 
Ida., where such tests had been conducted for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were done because the FAA had no turbulence-related data for the new 
generation of twin-engine passenger jets, such as the 757 and 767, that took to 
the skies in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 What the researchers found out about the 757 both surprised and alarmed them: 
The narrow-body 757 appeared to cause more wake turbulence than any plane ever 
tested by NOAA, even military planes three and a half times its size. The 757's 
wake speed of 326 feet per second -- 222 m.p.h. -- was more than the winds 
generated by Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the test, which involved flying a 757 past a 200-foot 
tower equipped with sophisticated electronic equipment, the force of the 
aircraft's wake wrenched the equipment "out of its mounting socket" -- a first 
in two decades of such testing, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers issued a draft report of their findings in May, 1991. Although 
they didn't issue the final version of their report until January, 1993, they 
presented their results publicly in October 1991 at the FAA's International 
Conference on Aircraft Wake Vortices in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculating that the unusually high level of turbulence may be linked to the 
757's sleek wing and flap design, Garodz and Clawson recommended that smaller 
planes landing behind 757s be kept four miles behind and that heavier aircraft 
stay three miles behind on final approach. That recommendation -- and another, 
that further testing be conducted -- were ignored, the researchers said in 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not make (the recommendations) lightly," Clawson said from his home in 
Idaho. "We felt that what the report did was bring it to the FAA's attention. 
But they're the regulatory agency. What happens after the report is up to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick from the FAA cautioned against lending too much weight to the NOAA 
report, saying "people make recommendations about all kinds of things. You have 
to evaluate . . . whether or not they are appropriate or make sense." He said 
the data were not definitive. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same October, 1991, symposium that Garodz and Clawson presented their 
report, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority also gave a report on 
wake turbulence, documenting incidents involving the 757 dating back to the 
early 1980s. The report said there was a disproportionate number of wake 
turbulence-related incidents involving 757s and advised that the matter be 
looked into. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1993, a month after the Billings, Mont., fatal accident, officials 
with NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System expressed their concerns about the 
problem in a teleconference call with FAA officials, according to Reynard, who 
runs ASRS. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynard said: "Starting back about this time last year we raised this issue in 
a telecon with the FAA . . . and discussed what we had been seeing in the 
reports coming in. We felt it needed to be pursued." 
</P>
<P>
 Begun in 1976 at the FAA's request, ASRS is managed by NASA and allows pilots 
and air traffic controllers nationwide to report mishaps and safety concerns 
confidentially. Reynard said it was founded to alert the FAA to potential 
problems before an accident happens because "it makes more sense to investigate 
something when it's an incident, instead of waiting for an accident." 
</P>
<P>
 ASRS officials brought the issue up again in April at the quarterly meeting of 
the FAA's Air Traffic Controllers Advisory Committee, Reynard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was of a concern to us," he said. "It struck us that here we had this 
information, that we had conveyed it, and nothing happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA's Broderick downplayed the 2-year-old British report, saying: "We met 
with the British several weeks ago, and I'm sure they would have brought this 
up if they were alarmed." 
</P>
<P>
 However, in retrospect, Broderick said, the FAA could have acted sooner in 
issuing the type of bulletin Hinson issued Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 But even then, Broderick said, the measure was taken "out of an abundance of 
caution," not because of any perceived danger to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick said neither of the two accidents -- the Santa Ana crash or the 
Billings, Mont., incident -- would have happened if the pilots had followed 
basic rules of airmanship. Pilots are always told to fly above the path of a 
leading jet to stay out of its wake, Broderick said. Furthermore, he said, both 
pilots were flying under visual flight rules, which meant the pilots 
themselves, not air traffic controllers, were responsible for maintaining a 
safe cushion between their planes and the 757s in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a matter of physics that if in fact a following airplane stays above 
the preceding airplane, the following airplane will never encounter the wake of 
the preceding plane," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other aviation sources say that, at a minimum, the FAA was obliged to say what 
it knew about the 757's dangerous wake turbulence so pilots could take extra 
precautions when landing behind them. At most, some people, including Garodz, 
believe the FAA should have mandated a three- or four-mile separation for 
aircraft landing behind 757s in all circumstances, at least until it conducted 
further tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can make recommendations in Washington for rule changes, but it can be 
very hard to get implemented," Garodz said. A Princeton University graduate and 
former Navy pilot who flew in the Korean War, and received the Distinguished 
Flying Cross and the Air Medal, Garodz worked in the FAA's wake turbulence 
program for 20 years. When he retired in 1986, he was the program manager. "The 
757 had the most intense vortex system I'd ever measured." 
</P>
<P>
 A national aviation source who requested anonymity because he works with the 
FAA on rule changes said: "There is kind of a common concern that it often 
takes a catastrophic incident before the FAA does anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar criticism has been leveled at the FAA in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, after South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson was killed when the 
propeller on the small plane he was flying in failed, it was revealed that 
National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Carl Vogt had written the FAA in 
the months preceding the accident, urging mass inspections of that very 
propeller. As late as six weeks before the tragedy, Vogt told the FAA the 
flawed propeller could cause a "catastrophic accident." The FAA responded that 
the propeller had flown millions of air miles without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation that there were previous warnings in that case prompted Sen. 
Larry Pressler, R-South Dakota, to call for congressional hearings on the FAA's 
response, or lack of a response. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA subsequently ordered the replacement of propellers on all planes like 
the one involved in the crash that killed Mickelson and seven others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While tests on the 757 are under way, those in the industry speculate that the 
aircraft's unique wing design may be the biggest reason it produces so much 
more turbulence than other planes its size. Unlike most aircraft, whose flaps 
are cut into sections, the 757's wing flaps are one solid piece. That means 
there is no place for the air to escape as it travels along the base of the 
wing gaining speed and momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's that very design, experts say, that makes the 757 among the most 
fuel-efficient and quiet commercial passenger jets ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese said the 757 has been in service since 1982 
and only recently had the wake turbulence problem been cited in any accident. 
This year alone, she said, the worldwide fleet of 574 757s have, collectively, 
logged 7 million safe hours in the air, traveling 2.7 billion miles and making 
3.5 million landings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been an issue and the aircraft has been in service for 10 years," 
Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB, which is investigating both the crashes in which 757 turbulence is 
believed to have been a factor, has asked the company for whatever data it has 
on 757 wake turbulence, Reese said. She said the company is cooperating "in the 
interest of aviation safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Times librarian Sheila Kern contributed to this report. Dangerous Wake Since 
1991, studies have shown that a Boeing 757 causes more wake turbulence than 
planes even 2 1/2 times larger. How wing design differences affect turbulence 
of a 757 and a Boeing 747: * Boeing 757 Large wake turbulence: Long, continuous 
flap generates horizontal tornadoes that can violently disrupt the air around 
planes following too closely; in some cases, the FAA requires small planes to 
stay at least four miles behind a 757 * One long flap Boeing 747 Smaller wake 
turbulence: Shorter, double flaps create mini-tornadoes; strength of turbulence 
diminishes quickly as the pairs of mini-tornadoes collide with each other; 
turbulence diminishes 1 to 1 1/2 minutes downstream * Two shorter flaps Source:

LAWMAKERS TAKE QUICK AIM AT CRIME; LEGISLATURE: THE 1994 SEASON OPENS WITH 
BILLS IN BOTH HOUSES CALLING FOR LIFE IMPRISONMENT FOR THOSE CONVICTED OF A 
THIRD VIOLENT FELONY.

<P>
 The Legislature began the year Monday concerned about crime and two lawmakers 
quickly proposed to lock away repeat offenders for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting the tone, at least in the early stages of the 1994 session, Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) confirmed earlier assessments that crime 
will be among the top legislative issues this year. "The public generally 
believes they are in danger and more so than they have ever been," he told 
reporters on the Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has called a special legislative session on crime -- to run 
with the regular session -- urging lawmakers to quickly adopt measures to give 
life sentences to criminals convicted of a third violent felony. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first measures introduced Monday was a bill by Sen. Rob Hurtt 
(R-Garden Grove) that is identical to a "three strikes and you're out" proposal 
intended for the November general election ballot. A similar measure was 
introduced by Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Placentia). Enactment of either bill 
could eliminate the need for the voter initiative.  
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) also introduced legislation to prohibit 
violent and sexual offenders from using work-time credits to reduce their 
prison sentences by more than 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping with the anti-crime theme of its opening day, the Assembly adjourned 
in the memory of Polly Klaas, the 12-year-old Petaluma girl who was kidnaped 
from her home during a slumber party and later killed, causing nationwide 
publicity that helped persuade Wilson to call the special crime session. 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker said he plans to attend Wilson's crime summit this month in Los 
Angeles where a host of experts are scheduled to recommend what should be done 
to curb growing crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a crime agenda of my own," Brown said. "I hope it (the summit) 
will not be a waste of energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he hoped that his education summit, planned for mid-February in San 
Francisco, would produce results at least equal to last year's economic summit, 
credited by some with helping in the adoption of workers' compensation reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's opening day was punctuated with the roaring sound of motorcycles as 
an estimated 500 black-leather-clad riders rallied outside the Capitol to urge 
lawmakers to repeal a 1992 mandatory helmet law. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), the first victim of 
voter-approved term limits, said he will step down from his leadership post 
soon, but declined to give a date. Roberti is expected to be succeeded by Sen. 
Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is scheduled to present his annual State of the State speech to the 
Assembly and Senate at 5 p.m. Wednesday, and unveil his 1994-95 proposed state 
budget Friday morning.

STATE PARK CLOSED AFTER COUGAR MENACES BIKERS; WILDLIFE: CLOSURE IS THE SECOND 
IN FOUR MONTHS BECAUSE OF AN ENCOUNTER WITH A MOUNTAIN LION. TRACKERS ARE 
TRYING TO FIND AND KILL OR REMOVE IT. 
</P>

<P>
 For the second time in four months, areas of this wooded park 45 miles east of 
San Diego have been closed after after a German shepherd-size mountain lion 
came within a few feet of three people riding trail bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the bikers climbed a tree to escape the cat, which then crouched at the 
bottom of the tree and swished its tail until it was scared away by barking 
sounds made by another biker hiding behind a bush. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sunday morning, signs warning "Mountain Lion Encounter, Area Closed" were 
posted in the southern region of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Trackers hired by the state Department of Fish and Game scoured the forest 
Monday for the cat, with orders to kill it or shoot it with a tranquilizer dart 
so it can be relocated. The trackers and their dogs will be back today. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the park was closed for two weeks as trackers tried 
unsuccessfully to locate a mountain lion that had menaced horseback riders. 
</P>
<P>
 The day the park reopened, the lion re-emerged and bit a 10-year-old girl in 
front of her terrified family. The lion was chased and shot to death by two 
park rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rangers found the experience emotionally wrenching and were given 
administrative duty for several days and sent to a police-trained psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision on killing or tranquilizing the animal now being sought will be 
made by the trackers when they spot the cat, Fish and Game spokesman Pat Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the cat is wounded or acts aggressively, or if the trackers feel 
threatened, it will be shot. Otherwise, it may be hit with a tranquilizing 
dart, as was a mountain lion that was cornered in the San Bernardino National 
Forest recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said the encounter is probably the result of an increasing mountain lion 
population and an increasing number of park visitors in the same forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more animals and more squeezing of their territory," said Ken 
Smith, head ranger at the park, located in the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Sightings of mountain lions are on the rise throughout Southern California. In 
1986, two people, in separate incidents, were mauled by mountain lions at 
Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park near San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the cougar population boom is thought to be a ban on mountain 
lion hunting endorsed by state voters in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Rangers believe there are six to 10 mountain lions in Cuyamaca Rancho park. 
Mountain lions are solitary creatures with defined hunting territories, and the 
lion spotted on New Year's weekend may be a female or immature male unable to 
claim a hunting area from a bigger animal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be an animal who has become frustrated in finding a territory," 
Smith said. "It may have decided that humans aren't all that bad to be around. 
. . . Maybe as it gets hungrier, it could decide that humans are good to eat 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Tentative plans are to reopen Green Valley Campground and surrounding hiking 
trails on Wednesday whether or not the predator is found. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the incident, some campers remained in areas that were not closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're careful, a mountain lion isn't going to hurt you," said Duane 
Milliken, a landscaper from Coronado who lived in Alaska for 20 years. "Moose 
kill more people than mountain lions." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, just to be prepared, Milliken kept two hatchets near his tent.

NOT ALL SUGAR AND SPICE; SPORTS: HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR DANA ZIEGERT, 17, IS 
REDEFINING WHAT GIRLS ARE MADE OF, FIRST BY COMPETING ON THE BOYS WRESTLING 
TEAM AND THEN BEING VOTED HOMECOMING QUEEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dana Ziegert stuck with it as the only girl on the Newbury Park High School 
boys wrestling team long enough to be accepted as one of the guys, making the 
honor she won last year all the more striking. 
</P>
<P>
 "My principal said I'm the first wrestler to be voted homecoming queen," the 
17-year-old senior said. "I was really surprised to even be nominated." 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegert started wrestling in ninth grade and is in the middle of her fourth 
year on the squad, she said. The plan was to try it for a week and drop out if 
it wasn't fun. But she found she enjoyed the demands of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're done, you feel tired, hungry, thirsty, hot and sweaty, but it's 
such a good feeling," Ziegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Ziegert kept coming back and working hard won her the respect of 
teammates and classmates who may have raised an eyebrow when she first went out 
for the squad, said wrestling coach Marty Maciel, a biology teacher at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the toughest sport on campus, by far," Maciel said. "It's the most 
challenging and time-consuming." 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegert's resolve has been tested: She hasn't won many of her matches, but she 
never gave up, Maciel said. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not always been easy for Ziegert to pursue such a physical sport. Peer 
pressure took its toll in the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first couple of years, a lot of people teased her about it a lot, but 
now people look up to her because of it," said Eric Masaki, a senior who 
started on the team the same year Ziegert did. 
</P>
<P>
 Another senior who joined the team as a freshman said he laughed it off when 
he saw a girl trying out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought: 'She won't make it.' And here she is, senior year," said Casey 
Waldron, 17. "She's homecoming queen and she's still wrestling, and I think 
it's pretty rad. She has a lot of character." 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegert said she was not trying to prove anything by joining the team. She 
just wanted to participate in sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people thought I was really a women's-libber," she said. "I heard a 
lot about 'Why is she doing this? Why would she want to?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is simple, Ziegert said. At 5 feet, 2 inches, she is too short for 
basketball, never excelled at softball or swimming, and didn't like running. 
Her friends understood, and now Ziegert knows that other students have come 
around too. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any homecoming queen, Ziegert said she was honored to win what is 
typically considered a beauty and popularity contest. But the victory meant 
more than the chance to wear a crown for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me feel really good that people know I'm still a girl and I like to 
wear dresses," Ziegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a December meet in Camarillo, Ziegert marked another milestone: Wrestling 
at 130 pounds, she scored her first pin, beating a Ventura High School boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best feeling to know all this hard work paid off finally," said 
Ziegert, who has wrestled for both the varsity and junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying with wrestling taught her important lessons about life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a lot more confident because of this," she added. "I think if I can go 
through this, I can do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Wrestling may have made Ziegert a stronger person, but it made her mother a 
wreck -- but not because Ziegert is a girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would feel the same way if my son were wrestling," Luci Ziegert said. "It 
seems so physical. It makes me nervous."

RIOTING INMATES SET FIRE TO VENEZUELA PRISON; 100 KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inmates shot and stabbed one another and set fire to a vastly overcrowded 
prison in western Venezuela on Monday. At least 100 people reportedly died in 
the riot. 
</P>
<P>
 The melee at the National Jail of Maracaibo was reportedly subdued after about 
four hours, said police in Maracaibo, 440 miles west of Caracas. Authorities 
said they did not know what set off the riot. 
</P>
<P>
 Television news footage showed bloody, moaning prisoners being led from the 
jail or carried out on stretchers. In the background were armed, helmeted 
soldiers and drifting smoke from burning buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The national news agency Venpres put the death toll at 100 or more. Ortis 
Torres, a duty officer for the National Guard that quelled the riot, estimated 
150 deaths but said the death toll could change because bodies were still being 
pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately known if any guards or other prison workers were among 
the casualties. Phone calls placed to city hospitals, the morgue and the jail 
were unanswered and spokesmen for the National Guard and local firefighters 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got five bodies here, and there's another 40 to 50" at a police station 
waiting to be identified, a doctor at the local morgue, Nelson Bonilla, said 
via telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Tallies for the wounded ranged from 50 to 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Many prisoners were transferred to other jails, the governor of Zulia state, 
Lolita Aniyar de Castro, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison was built to hold 800 inmates but has about 3,000, according to the 
Maracaibo newspaper Panorama. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one prisoner dies each week in Venezuela's 33-prison system. The 
jails are overcrowded, are rife with drug use and do not separate prisoners 
according to the severity of their crimes.

ACCORD REPORTEDLY NEAR ON N. KOREA NUCLEAR INSPECTION; DIPLOMACY: WASHINGTON 
SAYS 'A FEW WRINKLES' REMAIN. PYONGYANG MUST STILL WORK OUT TERMS OF VISITS 
WITH INTERNATIONAL AGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The United States and North Korea are drawing close to an agreement permitting 
international inspections of North Korean nuclear installations, "but there are 
a few wrinkles that need to be ironed out," a senior State Department official 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea still needs to work out a separate agreement with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency based in Vienna on the specific terms and 
logistics of the nuclear inspections. There has been no major progress on that 
agreement yet, U.S. officials caution. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Koreans "have not yet been in touch with the IAEA," a senior Clinton 
Administration official said. "We still don't have the clarifications that 
would be necessary for the IAEA to proceed with inspections." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Dec. 24 that Pyongyang generally had agreed at talks in New 
York to permit the international agency to inspect all seven nuclear facilities 
that the Communist regime has acknowledged on its territory. That concession 
opened the way for a possible end to the diplomatic stalemate over North 
Korea's nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Administration officials said that the final details paving the way 
for an agreement might come as early as this week. But another senior U.S. 
official said that he is still unsure whether there will be any accord, because 
North Korea has a history of bargaining hard and raising last-minute obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have suggested repeatedly that the United States and 
its allies might resort to sanctions or an oil embargo if diplomacy does not 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Washington and Pyongyang reach agreement permitting inspections of the 
seven North Korean facilities, it would amount to only a temporary easing of 
the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear program. Such a pact still would leave 
unresolved a number of disputes concerning North Korea's undeclared nuclear 
sites and its past efforts to develop nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The nuclear crisis began last February when the international atomic agency 
told Pyongyang that it wanted to carry out special inspections of two sites 
where Western officials believe North Korea has hidden waste materials produced 
after it secretly reprocessed plutonium in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea countered by announcing that it would pull out of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the international agreement that provides the basis 
for IAEA inspections. North Korean officials later withdrew that threat but 
then balked at permitting even regular visits by the international agency to 
their nuclear installations. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the agreement now under consideration would only return the 
situation to where it was last February, before the agency sought permission to 
make special inspections of the undeclared waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the scenario worked out in New York, after North Korea reaches an 
agreement paving the way for inspections, the United States and South Korea 
would formally agree to give up their annual Team Spirit joint military 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 And the United States and North Korea would then move forward to a third, 
broader round of diplomatic negotiations. Administration officials have said 
that at these talks, the United States would offer incentives -- such as normal 
relations and economic benefits -- in exchange for steps by North Korea to give 
up its suspected nuclear arms program. 
</P>
<P>
 One other obstacle that still needs to be worked out, U.S. officials said, is 
the Administration's insistence that North Korea also agree to a meeting of 
special envoys with South Korea. The Administration wants to make sure that 
North Korea meets face-to-face with South Korea rather than conducting its 
diplomacy only with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 A State Department official said Monday that he does not believe this 
requirement for talks between North and South Korea will become a stumbling 
block.

GOVERNMENT; AIRPORT SCANDAL HANGS OVER NEW ATLANTA MAYOR; BILL CAMPBELL BEGINS 
HIS FIRST TERM JUST AS JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN A CORRUPTION TRIAL. HE IS 
IMPLICATED IN BRIBE-TAKING TO AID MINORITY CONTRACTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As Bill Campbell prepared to be sworn in as Atlanta's new mayor on Monday, 
jury selection began in a potentially explosive public corruption trial that 
could make his honeymoon in office a short one. 
</P>
<P>
 A former city councilman and two Atlanta businessmen face mail fraud and 
bribery charges in connection with the scandal, which developed from a 22-month 
federal investigation of the city's program to boost minority participation in 
concessions at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, seven men have pleaded guilty or been charged in a multimillion-dollar 
conspiracy to bribe public officials in exchange for preferential treatment in 
the awarding of airport contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, a 12-year City Council veteran, was one of several officials 
identified by a government witness as having received bribes. Campbell has not 
been indicted, and he vehemently denied the accusation when it surfaced during 
the campaign -- going so far as to take a polygraph test. 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal had little effect on the election, perhaps due in part to 
unaggressive coverage of the allegations in the local media and to a judge's 
decision to postpone the trial until after the election. Campbell won 73% of 
the vote in defeating former Fulton County Commission Chairman Michael L. 
Lomax. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Campbell says that he is unconcerned about potentially damaging 
testimony, his initiatives during the first weeks of his term nevertheless will 
have to compete for attention with allegations of shady doings and 
under-the-table deals at City Hall. And this is only the first of at least 
three trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Promising to be "the most accessible mayor the city has ever seen," the 
40-year-old Campbell attended a morning prayer service Monday and then walked 
to City Hall as jury selection got under way. He made strategic stops at a 
police precinct substation (to stress his stand on community policing), the 
Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change (to praise the slain 
civil rights leader) and the state Capitol (for a symbolic greeting from the 
governor). He did his best to keep the airport scandal in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal also threatens to tarnish the legacy of Campbell's still-popular 
predecessor and mentor, Maynard Jackson. Jackson, who stepped down after 12 
years in office, is expected to testify for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport, one of the world's busiest, was expanded and modernized during 
Jackson's first term. The affirmative action program was designed to ensure 
women and minorities a fair share of airport business but allegedly became rife 
with corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bribery allegations rolled off Campbell's back during the campaign, 
he raised some eyebrows immediately after the election in an unrelated 
controversy concerning the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 He was instrumental in torpedoing a City Council audit of BestFest, a planned 
one-day morale booster for airport employees in September that became a 
$757,000 three-day bash, financed by tax money, that included jugglers, a 
karaoke bar, live bands and Las Vegas-style gambling with fake money. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Campbell, Jackson has attempted to deflect damage from the airport 
scandal, taking credit for discovering problems and volunteering information to 
the U.S. attorney general. Nevertheless, he concedes making a mistake when he 
appointed the first airport commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the accomplishments of his first two terms in office, Jackson has 
had to contend in the waning days of his Administration with editorial cartoons 
depicting him as a clown. In one cartoon, Jackson, dressed as Bozo with 
gigantic feet, is saying: "My handling of the airport has left Bill Campbell 
with some big shoes to fill."

POLITICS; HIGH TURNOVER IN CONGRESS SEEN AS MANY HEAD FOR EXITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Applying do-it-yourself term limits, many members of Congress are departing 
voluntarily at a rapid rate well in advance of the 1994 elections. Whether or 
not the current pace continues, it appears there will be a larger-than-usual 
turnover among both parties in the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The 110 members of the freshman class in the House, for example, will be more 
vulnerable to challengers next fall after serving only a single term. While 
scattered results from 1993 may not indicate a trend, a lingering 
anti-incumbent sentiment could produce another major shake-up in congressional 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 27 members of the House already have decided not to seek reelection 
this year, opting either to retire or to seek a statewide office, such as 
governor or senator. In the Senate, a minimum of seven new faces will answer 
roll calls next year, while upsets in primary and general elections could 
double that number. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for departure vary, but several lawmakers said they were burned 
out by the hectic pace on Capitol Hill and the low public approval ratings for 
Congress -- despite considerable legislative accomplishments in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those leaving -- like 42-year-old Rep. Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.) -- 
expressed frustration at their inability to achieve the level of budget 
reduction they believe is essential if the deficit is to be controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 Others -- such as 70-year-old House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) 
and 80-year-old Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.) -- simply decided the time to leave 
had come. Michel has served 19 terms and Pickle 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before this year's exodus, the average length of congressional service 
has dropped significantly, now averaging from eight to 10 years, or below the 
12-year-limit usually suggested by advocates of term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of seniority lists indicated that only 131 lawmakers in the 
435-member House have served more than 10 years at the start of this session of 
Congress and only 33 had been around for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, for example, 65 members of the House left voluntarily and 45 others 
were defeated in primary or general elections, accounting for one of the 
largest turnovers in the last 50 years. The House bank scandal affected many 
races where an incumbent had to defend a substantial number of overdrafts. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, the prospect of another large number of open seats means 
that both political parties will be tested. If historical trends hold, 
Democrats would be expected to lose about 25 House seats in the first off-year 
election after a member of their party won the White House. But a number of 
seats held by retiring Republicans may be vulnerable to a Democratic challenge 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "Few districts are safe anymore for anyone," said Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West 
Sacramento), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats in the House now hold a 258-176 margin over Republicans, with 
one independent. While they are extremely unlikely to lose a majority, their 
effective control of the House could be jeopardized by a strong GOP 
orchestrated by Rep. Bill Paxon (R-N.Y.), who heads the National Republican 
Congressional Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate, where Democrats now have a 56-44 advantage, appears unlikely to 
change significantly as a result of the November balloting. Six senators -- 
three Democrats and three Republicans -- have announced they will not seek 
reelection. Another Democrat, appointed Sen. Harlan Mathews of Tennessee, is 
not considered likely to run for election in his own right.

BATTLES ROCK AFGHAN CAPITAL FOR THIRD DAY; REVOLT: THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS IT HAS 
BEATEN OFF COUP ATTEMPT BY FORMER COMMUNIST LEADERS AND DISAFFECTED PREMIER. 
BUT FIGHTING CONTINUES. 
</P>

<P>
 The Afghan capital was blasted with rockets and mortar bombs for a third 
straight day Monday, but the government claimed to have beaten off a coup 
attempt by former Communist leaders and the discontented prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation in Kabul is "under control," asserted Eshan Jan Areef, charge 
d'affaires at Afghanistan's embassy here. The forces fighting against President 
Burhanuddin Rabbani, he said, "must be crushed." 
</P>
<P>
 News agencies said over 70 people had been killed and about 700 wounded in the 
factional warfare that erupted in Kabul before dawn on New Year's Day, although 
definite figures were impossible to get. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the Afghan Foreign Ministry said only "minor resistance" was 
being experienced in Kabul proper on Monday. In fact, scores of rockets and 
artillery rounds rained down on government and military buildings and 
residential districts alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Jets from the government's air force counterattacked, bombing the rebel 
stronghold at the ancient Bala Hissar fort south of Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbani's official palace and its grounds were struck many times by rockets 
and explosive shells. But observers said his forces appeared to still be in 
control of most of the key locations in the city, the presidential palace 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Rabbani's government accused Abdul Rashid Dostum, a general 
during the days of Afghanistan's pro-Soviet Communist regime, of joining forces 
with disaffected Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's hard-line Hezb-i-Islami 
group, which is headquartered 15 miles southeast of Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
 Another alleged party to the "shameless conspiracy" to grab control of the 
country's most important city was Mahmood Baryalai, brother of Afghanistan's 
former pro-Soviet puppet ruler Babrak Karmal, the Foreign Ministry charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Denouncing as "un-Islamic" the attempt to unseat him, Rabbani appealed Sunday 
to other parties in the fractious coalition government to join him and wage 
jihad (holy war) against the guerrillas. The Foreign Ministry statement blasted 
Hekmatyar for being ready to make common cause with the Communists whom he and 
other leaders of the Muslim resistance had fought courageously for years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Reuters news agency quoted one of Dostum's senior commanders as saying 
that ethnic grievances, not economics or religion, were the real reason for the 
revolt against the president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We carried out the attack because we wanted to change the political system in 
Afghanistan," said the commander, identified only as Gen. Fauzi. "Rabbani is 
running the country only in favor of the Tajiks." 
</P>
<P>
 Dostum and his fighters are Uzbeks, a minority that lives in Afghanistan's 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 Afghanistan's Islamic militias formed a coalition government after ousting the 
Soviet-backed regime of President Najibullah in 1992. But they have since 
turned their guns on each other, and at least 10,000 people have died.

15 DIE IN SARAJEVO AS FIERCE SHELLING SHATTERS A BRIEF LULL IN FIGHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fierce shelling killed 15 people in Sarajevo on Monday, including five members 
of one family slain near the presidency building and a girl killed as she and 
other children left kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest tragedies in the 20-month siege of Sarajevo came on a fair day that 
lured residents out during the first lull in fighting since pre-Christmas peace 
talks collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 By early afternoon, shelling and sniping broke out all over the city, sending 
people rushing for shelter. Fifteen shells hit near the U.N. headquarters, 
while a single shell exploded 500 yards from the presidency, killing five 
members of one family, said Maj. Idesbald van Biesebroeck, a spokesman for the 
U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations counted 14 dead on the Bosnian side, including at least 
three children, he said. One woman was killed in a Serb-held district. More 
than 200 shells rained down on the city. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one child was killed when two shells smashed into a crowd of children 
leaving a kindergarten in western Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen many dead and badly wounded people, but I have never seen such 
horrible wounds as this," said Dr. Jansina Tahmaz in Sarajevo's main hospital 
as she stared at the dead girl. 
</P>
<P>
 A boy suffered severe head wounds, and three other children were among 14 
injured sent to Kosevo Hospital, said Dr. Davor Tomic. The only other Sarajevo 
hospital reported 16 wounded, including one child. 
</P>
<P>
 Alma Begovic, who suffered minor leg wounds and shock in the shelling, said 
the children had just left kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of children playing," she said. "Two shells landed. I didn't 
hear or see anything, I was just looking for my child. She wasn't injured. I 
don't know how, because it seemed to me a shell landed only a yard away." 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian shelling of Sarajevo has increased markedly since peace talks stalled 
in Brussels on Dec. 23, and fighting between predominantly Muslim government 
and Croatian forces in central Bosnia has escalated sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Three people were killed and 10 wounded in the government-held city of Visoko, 
12 miles northwest of Sarajevo, Bosnian radio said. There was no independent 
confirmation of the report.

HYDRAULIC FAILURE REPORTED IN CRASH

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Russian passenger plane's hydraulic system reportedly failed before it 
crashed Monday in Siberia, killing all 120 people aboard. Initial reports had 
put the death toll at 116. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet-made Tu-154 had just taken off from Irkutsk on a flight to Moscow, 
2,500 miles to the west, when one of its three engines failed. The plane 
crashed in a field seven miles outside Irkutsk after the engine caught fire. 
The Itar-Tass news agency said the hydraulic system failed before the engine 
caught fire, but it was not clear if the two problems were linked. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the jet carried nine crew members and 111 passengers, 
including 17 foreigners. Russian television said a farmer was killed on the 
ground and Itar-Tass said a milkmaid was injured, but officials said they were 
unaware of any casualties on the ground.

PACKWOOD TAKES TENSE TOUR OF HOME TURF; ETHICS: THE OREGON REPUBLICAN HEARS 
ANGRY, HEARTFELT PLEAS TO RESIGN OVER SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGES. HE SAYS HE'S 
ENTITLED TO A FAIR HEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man on the run, facing scrutiny by the courts, the Justice Department and 
the U.S. Senate, Bob Packwood returned home Monday to hear the toughest 
judgments of all: the angry, heartfelt, sometimes snide pleas of his 
constituents to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," said the five-term Republican senator, his lips tight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you think I'm entitled to a hearing?" he demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-day private rest on the Oregon coast, Packwood began a 10-day home 
state tour Monday, ostensibly to talk about health care reform, an ordinary 
enough event for ordinary politicians. But for Packwood, who has represented 
the state for nearly a quarter century, charges of habitually harassing women 
have mushroomed into full-scale scandal, and some Oregonians stood up to him 
Monday and said they have had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe you deserve a fair hearing," said constituent Peggy Lynch, a 
Beaverton community volunteer who confronted Packwood at a crowded civic forum 
here. "But we're in a crisis in Oregon and we've got to have credibility in all 
our government officials. And if sacrificing your personal fair hearing is for 
the good of the nation and the good of Oregon, then that's what I would like to 
see." 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood, standing a few feet away, perspired under the hot lights of massed 
news cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me ask the people in the room, how many of you think I should have a 
hearing?" Packwood asked. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen or more in the crowd of 90 raised their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many do not?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody. 
</P>
<P>
 But Packwood did not put to a vote questions that are more urgently discussed 
here: Should he quit? Has he lost his effectiveness? Has he given Oregon a 
black eye? Should a senator evoke the 5th Amendment to protect himself? 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood said his troubles deserved the full protection of the American legal 
process. He wanted a hearing, he said, and he wanted it quickly. He did not 
elaborate on his battle to withhold his personal diaries from the Senate Ethics 
Committee, a struggle that has now gone to the federal courts and has slowed 
the Senate investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a hearing, wish I had a hearing two months ago. But I can't make the 
Ethics Committee work any faster," Packwood insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his effectiveness, he sought to depersonalize the workings of the 
Senate, which is frequently described as America's most exclusive club and 
where some fellow senators have called for him to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say we're on the floor of the Senate. They're not going to vote for or 
against a bill because I authored it. They will vote for or against it for a 
variety of reasons, but it won't be because of who authored it," he said. And 
he added that his legal troubles in Washington required only two to four hours 
of his time each week, while the rest he devoted to the routine tasks of being 
a senator and member of the Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Another questioner in Monday's audience of the Washington County Public 
Affairs Forum rose and described himself as a former neighbor of Packwood's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's inevitable you're going to have to resign. And I ask you today . 
. . to do it," said the man in suit and tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood gave no reply. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did he seem to notice a small sign another guest held aloft: "Resign 
Now. You still don't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 What made the questions seem extraordinary is that Packwood handpicked his 
forum, a small suburban Portland civic group that included among its members a 
college classmate, a former state legislative colleague and any number of other 
men and women whose association with the senator went back 30 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience politely listened to his informal and relaxed speech on the 
fundamentals of health care, and a preponderance of the questions stuck to the 
topic. Many were quick to say that they supported Packwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of all he has done for Oregon," said David Eldon, a part-time pollster 
from Beaverton. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, including a half-dozen who picketed outside, vowed to dog Packwood, 
just as they have since December, 1992, when the first of more than two dozen 
women publicly accused him of sexual misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got up this morning in the rain to come and say it's time for him to go. 
I'm embarrassed. We need a break," said Jeannie Fagman, a former school board 
member in Oregon. "He knows it, and I just wish he'd get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
 After his luncheon speech, Packwood spoke to reporters. An aide said questions 
would have to be limited to the topic of health care. But the inevitable 
question came anyway: Would he resign? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He delivered the same answer in a local television interview, although he 
acknowledged that for a time on a "low day" he considered resigning. But then 
the Justice Department issued a subpoena for his diaries, and he said he 
decided it was better to fight back as a senator than as a citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge in Washington, D.C., is expected to rule this week on Packwood's 
efforts to keep his diaries from investigators. Packwood's attorney cited 5th 
Amendment protections against self-incrimination among the reasons the diaries 
should not be given to the Senate Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions at Monday's press conference were a measure of just how far 
Packwood's star has fallen. Not only are there charges about unwanted sexual 
advances on women, about lobbyists offering his wife a job, about whether he 
altered his diaries after the scandal broke, but he now is accused of being a 
carpetbagger in his own state, thanks to news accounts that reported he no 
longer owns a home here. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he live in Oregon? Packwood was asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a legal resident of Oregon," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Where does he live? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a legal resident. I do not own a home. See you later, folks." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, Packwood left.

EAST COAST BRACES FOR NEW SNOW-LADEN STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Snowplows and salt trucks were gassed up Monday and some schools closed as the 
second storm in a week threatened to drop up to two feet of snow along the East 
Coast and Appalachians. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm comes on the heels of a snowy blast that left up to six inches of 
snow in the Midwest and was blamed for as many as nine deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Two low-pressure areas were expected to combine into one storm during the 
night and roll northeastward along the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter storm warnings were posted through today from the mountains of western 
North Carolina into New England. Thunderstorm warnings were issued for parts of 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 New York City's Sanitation Department was at its highest level of storm alert, 
with all 350 salt spreaders loaded and snowplows attached to more than 1,250 
garbage trucks, department spokeswoman Anne Canty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to two feet of snow was forecast for the mountains of northern West 
Virginia by tonight, with five to 11 inches at lower elevations, the weather 
service said. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes were canceled Monday in some West Virginia counties where as much as a 
foot of snow remained on the ground from a storm a week earlier. Some Monday 
night college basketball games were postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools also were closed in parts of western North Carolina after sleet, snow 
and freezing rain. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bluefield, W. Va., rock salt supplier said he sold out last week and won't 
receive any more until at least the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sold as much salt this year as we have the past three years," manager 
Tripper Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Light but steady snow was already falling in western Pennsylvania. Up to 18 
inches was forecast in central Pennsylvania's mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther west, along the eastern slopes of the Rockies, chinook wind buffeted 
northern Colorado, blowing down a house under construction in Ft. Collins and 
gusting to 105 m.p.h. at Squaw Mountain south of Idaho Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 The wind, coupled with eight to 10 inches of new snow in the central Rockies, 
increased the avalanche danger, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center 
reported.

MARINES MAKE LAWYER A CAPTAIN, ADMIT RACISM IN HIS '89 DISMISSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost five years after Bruce Yamashita was insulted, abused and kicked out of 
Officer Candidate School, the Marines have admitted blame and made him a 
captain in the Marine Corps Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamashita, 37, a Washington attorney of Japanese ancestry, said Monday that 
the military's recognition that racial harassment played a role in his 1989 
dismissal, two days before graduation, was "very, very important.It's something 
that the Marine Corps has just been ignoring." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Navy Secretary Frederick F. Y. Pang, in a letter to Yamashita last 
month, said he had determined that "the racially insensitive treatment to which 
you were subjected by individuals at OCS contributed to an environment which 
may have compromised your ability to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Pang said Yamashita would have achieved the rank of captain by now had he not 
been dismissed from OCS. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamashita said his instructors at OCS attacked him with racial slurs, threw 
garbage cans at him and lifted him up and threw him to the ground. They also 
forced him to wear a dirty uniform to a review board, he said. He was 
discharged from the school on grounds of "leadership failure." 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine Corps initially denied Yamashita's claims of discrimination but in 
1991 issued a formal apology, but no commission, after a further inquiry 
confirmed incidents of racial harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1993, the Corps offered him a commission as second lieutenant, but 
Yamashita rejected that as not taking into consideration the four years he had 
lost fighting the case.

 A Boston city councilor whose stances have angered black and gay leaders was 
voted council president, making him the city's second-ranking official.Since 
being elected a councilor in 1984, James Kelly opposed affirmative action and 
voted against the extension of city benefits to homosexuals' partners. In 
earlier years, he opposed court-ordered busing to racially integrate schools 
and forced integration of public housing. Seven of the council's 13 members 
voted for Kelly.

 Hopes that dolphins trapped in an icebound river inlet had made their way to 
the sea brightened with unofficial reports that the mammals were spotted off 
Sandy Hook. That sighting followed a report of three bottlenose dolphins in 
that vicinity the day before. The Coast Guard, Marine Police and volunteers 
from the Marine Mammal Stranding Center had tried to herd the dolphins from the 
ice-covered Shrewsbury River near Sea Bright to the Atlantic Ocean.

IRISH PREMIER IGNITES NEW CONTROVERSY ON N. IRELAND; BRITAIN: REYNOLDS' CALL 
FOR 'DEMILITARIZATION' PROMPTS CHARGES THAT HE SUPPORTS CONCESSIONS TO 
SEPARATISTS.

<P>
 The confusion over British-Irish government attempts to set up peace talks to 
end violence in Northern Ireland deepened Monday when Irish Prime Minister 
Albert Reynolds called for "demilitarization" of the troubled province. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds' remark sparked a new controversy when it was interpreted by Ulster 
Unionists, who want to maintain British rule in Northern Ireland, as a hint of 
possible concessions to separatists who want to join Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 15, Reynolds and British Prime Minister John Major issued a framework 
for peace negotiations, called the Downing Street Declaration, that would 
include supporters of the outlawed Irish Republican Army if the group would lay 
down its weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time has come to start a process of demilitarization of the Northern 
conflict," Reynolds said in a statement published in a Dublin newspaper. The 
statement came after Major said that neither he nor the Irish prime minister 
would discuss the declaration further until they received an official response 
from Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bruton, leader of the opposition in Ireland's Parliament, complained that 
Reynolds should have chosen his words more carefully. "Anything that is said 
that is not immediately clear as to what it means is something that should not 
be said in a situation as delicate and difficult as this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the (prime minister) had used a phrase which could have a 
double meaning -- and that is not a very wise thing for him to have done." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Ian Paisley, militant leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, said 
Reynolds' comments showed that he had "come out in his true colors," adding 
that the peace plan had on it "the bloody thumbprint of the IRA." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past Sinn Fein has called for "demilitarization" of the province, 
signifying a British withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 And David Trimble, an Ulster Unionist member of Parliament, warned that 
Reynolds was "trying to pull the declaration closer to the IRA position. He 
signed the declaration and he is going beyond it. I hope Downing Street will 
proceed to rein him in as he goes off on a bit of frolic on his own." 
</P>
<P>
 But a parliamentary supporter of the Irish government, Dermot Ahern, tried to 
explain Reynolds' remarks by indicating that the prime minister was trying to 
get a message through to the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mr. Reynolds was trying to suggest yet again," he said, "that if we 
had a peaceful atmosphere, if there was a lack of military presence -- both 
from a paramilitary point of view and indeed, consequently, a British security 
point of view -- things would be a lot easier for people on the island to sit 
together and attempt to sort out our differences." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahern said the first step would be for the Catholic republican and Protestant 
Unionist paramilitary forces to put down their arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, if that was the case, and if the security forces and the British 
government were aware of the fact this had taken place, then it would be 
possible for them, in effect, to go back to their barracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Martin McGuinness, a leading Sinn Fein figure, demanded 
clarification of the Downing Street Declaration and asked whether "this 
signaled the beginning of the process of bringing about an end to British rule 
in Ireland."

FRANCE SEEKS BAN ON ARTIFICIAL IMPREGNATION OF OLDER WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM DROZDIAK, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 France declared Monday that it would seek to become the first country to ban 
artificial impregnation for post-menopausal women as part of a landmark 
legislative effort to cope with the moral and medical dilemmas posed by genetic 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the French government to introduce legislation that would stop 
doctors from helping women past child-bearing age to give birth was announced 
Monday by Health Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy, who called it "both immoral 
and dangerous" for older women to be implanted with test-tube embryos. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials said the bill also will seek to prevent parents from selecting 
or determining physical and mental characteristics of their future child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is absolutely shocking that a child can be 18 when his mother is 
80. It is totally undeserved," Douste-Blazy said in a radio interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Douste-Blazy urged women considering such a procedure to give more thought to 
the child, who medical authorities say would be more susceptible to mental and 
physical handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon of "retirement pregnancies" has attracted wide attention in 
Europe after a 59-year-old British woman gave birth to twins over Christmas 
following treatment at an Italian clinic. The mother, who is said to be a 
wealthy businesswoman, reportedly is married to a 45-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
 French officials said the government was particularly alarmed by advances in 
medical technology that now make it feasible for women to choose the ethnic 
identity, physical size or other characteristics of their baby through embryo 
implants. 
</P>
<P>
 The government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is expected to unveil new 
legislation in the Senate within two weeks before taking it to the National 
Assembly. Passage is considered a virtual certainty because the ruling 
conservative coalition holds a vast majority in both houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some argued that the new law is necessary to reinforce the power of the state 
to prevent abuses that smack of genetic engineering. A de facto bar already 
prevents women from being implanted with fertilized embryos from eggs other 
than their own.

GARY, IND., BLAMES DRUGS, GUNS FOR TITLE OF U.S. MURDER CAPITAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The mayor of this former steelmaking center said Monday that Gary had earned 
the unenviable title of U.S. murder capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the result of too many guns, too many drugs and not enough jobs," Gary 
Mayor Thomas Barnes said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes also blamed a shortage of police for the lawlessness in this city of 
120,000, a few miles from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 A record 110 murders were committed in Gary last year, computing to a 
nationwide high of 91 murders per 100,000 residents. That was slightly higher 
than the per-capita homicide rate in Washington, D.C., which has held the title 
alongside Detroit in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortician Paul Robinson said his business is too good, and he has decided to 
do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes appearances at local schools, bringing along a mock coffin containing 
a mirror to allow schoolchildren to reflect on the potential victims of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you ask school kids how many knew a friend or relative who died a 
violent death, 90% will raise their hands," Robinson said.

LOBBYISTS SUE U.S. OVER BAN ON DEDUCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of national associations is suing the federal government to overturn a 
new law that in effect places a tax on lobbying by businesses and trade 
associations. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which took effect Saturday, ends the deductibility of lobbying costs 
as a business expense.For most groups that lobby, that means an immediate jump 
of up to 35% in their costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a challenge filed in federal court late last week, the American Society of 
Assn. Executives and 10 other groups said the law is an unconstitutional tax on 
speech and association. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the groups that joined the lawsuit said the law will cut their 
membership, since members could no longer deduct all of their association dues 
as a cost of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision was enacted as part of a massive deficit-reduction measure 
Congress passed last summer. At the time, the elimination of lobbying 
deductibility was estimated to bring in about $700 million in new tax revenue 
over five years. Congress had created the tax deduction for lobbying in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 R. William Taylor, president of the ASAE, said his group asked its members to 
let the Washington office know if the law would hurt them. "Within 10 days we 
had almost 500 responses, saying 'This is going to kill us,' " Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups argue that the law will not only impede their constitutional right 
to lobby Congress, the executive branch and state governments, but also will 
impose burdensome record-keeping responsibilities and curtail useful 
information that now flows from associations to Congress.

CHILDREN SOLICIT FUNDS FOR PARENTS' FUNERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four children who were orphaned in an apparent New Year's Eve murder-suicide 
have gone door-to-door in their neighborhood seeking donations to pay for their 
parents' funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, ages 9 to 14, said Monday they had collected about $1,500 to pay 
for the funeral. However, their plight caused dozens of residents in this 
heavily Cuban-American suburb of Miami to step forward with other cash 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the children's father, George Alfonso, apparently shot his wife, 
then himself. The four youngsters said they hoped to remain together, living 
with their grandmother nearby.

DELAY EXPECTED IN RELEASE OF CLINTON BUSINESS FILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton may take "a couple of weeks" to give the Justice Department 
personal records about a controversial business venture in Arkansas, the White 
House said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure for disclosure, the White House announced before Christmas that 
Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton would voluntarily turn over all 
of their records related to the Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The real estate venture has been linked to a failed savings and loan that is 
the subject of a federal investigation, and Republican members of Congress have 
been pressing for appointment of a special prosecutor. The Administration 
continued to resist that request on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said the Justice Department will not 
get the files until the documents are "catalogued" with the help of the White 
House counsel's office. The department did not request the documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's actually quite a bit of documents. This includes campaign files, 
personal files," she said. "They are in the process of being catalogued and 
will be turned over in the next couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides said the Clintons' lawyers are copying and creating a record 
of all the documents, much as they would in a standard legal proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior White House adviser Bruce Lindsey said: "They are checking to make sure 
-- going back to all the various sources, including the campaign files and 
others -- to make one final sweep to make sure they have everything we've 
agreed to turn over, which is everything we have." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Clintons' personal attorney, David Kendall, has been on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton brusquely turned aside a reporter's question Monday on his relation to 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Assn. and its head, former friend and political 
ally James McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he supported naming a special prosecutor to look into Whitewater 
records, Clinton said: "I have nothing to say about that. I've said we'll turn 
the records over. And there's nothing else for me to say about that." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview taped for broadcast tonight on the Fox network program "A 
Current Affair," McDougal reiterated previous denials of wrongdoing by himself 
or Clinton. "You won't find anything incriminating on me or the President. I 
certainly have no knowledge of any scandal that would have caused him 
distress," McDougal was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators are looking into whether any money from the thrift was 
illegally diverted to the Whitewater real estate venture, owned by the Clintons 
and McDougals, and whether thrift money helped pay off Clinton's political and 
personal debts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Atty. Gen. Janet Reno on Monday, Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.) again requested a special prosecutor.

PRESIDENT DELIVERS HEALTH CARE PEP TALK; LEGISLATION: THE GOP OPPOSITION HAS 
STIFFENED. CLINTON MAKES IT CLEAR TO ADVISERS THAT HIS REFORM PROPOSAL WILL BE 
THE TOP PRIORITY OF 1994. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton called together his top health care advisers for a photo 
opportunity and pep talk Monday amid signs of stiffened Republican opposition 
to the Administration's health care reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House meeting, Clinton's first public event of the new year, was 
designed largely as a showcase to demonstrate the President's commitment to the 
issue. But it comes at a time when the health reform effort has been under 
increasingly sharp partisan attack -- a marked contrast from the cautious 
approval with which Republicans greeted the plan's unveiling last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has made clear to his top aides that he intends health reform to be 
the overriding priority of the year and, in his remarks at the White House 
meeting, he likened the effort to two of the landmarks of Democratic social 
legislation in this century. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all look back now in American history (and) remember 1935 as the year that 
the American people adopted Social Security; 1965 is the year the American 
people adopted Medicare," he said. "I believe that 1994 will go down in history 
as the year when, after decades and decades of false starts and lame excuses 
and being overcome by special interests, the American people finally -- finally 
-- had health care security for all." 
</P>
<P>
 After several months in which his own plan has gone through extensive scrutiny 
that has generated doubts among many Americans about its financing and its 
costs, Clinton indicated that the White House will go more strongly on the 
attack against rival plans over the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to see a fleshing out of all the alternatives -- something that 
hasn't happened yet," he said. "The burden has been borne almost entirely by 
our plan, which is something I was willing to do. But now we need to look at 
the cost of the status quo and the cost and the consequences of the other 
plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, for their part, responded with sharp attacks. Rep. Dick Armey 
(R-Tex.), for example, called Clinton's plan a "bureaucratic nightmare that 
will kill jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) declared, "I am not going to support the President's 
effort to have the government take over and run the health care system." 
</P>
<P>
 The two Texas conservatives have persistently been among Clinton's sharpest 
critics. But this time, in marked contrast to the conciliatory tone of 
Republican statements in the fall, they were joined by senior Republicans, such 
as Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 When Congress finishes work on health care, "there wouldn't be much left of 
the Clinton bill," Dole said in a television interview over the weekend in 
which he said that several key features of Clinton's proposal would be 
unacceptable to Senate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 As the tone from both sides makes clear, after a few months of gingerly 
circling each other, the two sides have now joined the battle. Strategists on 
both sides believe that much of the outcome will depend on the steps they take 
in the next few weeks, in which supporters and opponents of the plan lay out 
their strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials, who at times last fall seemed distracted among 
Clinton's many priorities, have now clearly shoved other issues, such as 
welfare reform, aside in preparation for an all-out push for health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican leaders, for their part, "have acknowledged certain mistakes in the 
way they handled it off the bat," said William Kristol, the former George Bush 
Administration official who has urged Republicans to wage an uncompromising 
fight against Clinton's plan. Now, he said, the party has begun to engage 
Clinton more directly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first three months have been a draw," Kristol argued, saying that Clinton 
has failed to "generate a sense of inevitability" about his plan but that 
Republicans "haven't built any counter-momentum either." 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides disputed that point only somewhat -- arguing that Clinton 
has maintained the core of support he had when he unveiled his plan. But they 
conceded that many Americans who had been undecided have now moved into 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton hopes to begin turning the issue with his State of the Union speech on 
Jan. 25, which aides said probably will concentrate heavily on health care. He 
has also begun to focus his White House machinery on the topic -- assigning his 
senior aide, George Stephanopoulos, to concentrate on health reform strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanopoulos will work with a longtime Clinton political associate, New York 
lawyer Harold Ickes, who has joined the White House as deputy chief of staff 
with a mandate to focus almost exclusively on health reform for the next 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, White House officials said, Ickes will function as a campaign 
manager, marshaling the forces for the "outside game" -- everything from 
advertising to rallies to building coalitions with groups interested in the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanopoulos will run the "inside game" of developing strategies to move the 
health reform proposals through Congress -- handling negotiations and providing 
Clinton advice on the key deals he will have to cut in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Ira Magaziner, Clinton's health care policy adviser, meanwhile, will continue 
as the "policy guru," as a senior White House official put it -- analyzing the 
impact of competing plans but spending relatively less time dealing directly 
with members of Congress, many of whom have called him abrasive and arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress will not begin serious work on health reform proposals until after 
the State of the Union speech. Administration officials hope to pass key House 
committee hurdles in mid-spring which then would put them on track for final 
action on the competing plans sometime in late summer or early fall.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; LIBRARY EXPANSION PLAN TO BE REVIEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when Moorpark is spending city money to increase hours at Moorpark's 
county-run library, the City Council this week will review a county plan to 
expand the library itself. 
</P>
<P>
 But some council members have questioned the appropriateness of expanding the 
facility when the county is hard-pressed to keep the library open or stocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have to ask the question," Councilman Scott Montgomery said 
Monday. "Why are you making a bigger building with empty shelves that you can't 
afford to keep open instead of financing the hours to keep the library open?" 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John Wozniak has also strongly questioned the expansion plan in 
light of the county's slashing of weekly library hours from 51 to 20 last 
August during a bruising round of budget cuts. The council last month voted 3 
to 2 to spend $14,670 in general fund dollars to increase library hours through 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Paul Lawrason said the city is merely being asked to give input to a 
library expansion the county has promised for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to go forward with the expansion," Lawrason said. "When it comes to 
books and population to staff the library, we need to work that as a separate 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The council will discuss the expansion plan at its meeting beginning at 7 p.m. 
Wednesday in City Hall, 799 Moorpark Ave. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OAK PARK; SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS CLASSES FOR ADULTS

 The Oak Park school district will become the newest entry in the Ventura 
County adult education market when it begins offering a variety of workshops, 
classes and lectures at the end of January, school officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an experiment," program coordinator Paula Jensik said."We felt there 
was a real need in this community for an adult education program. There are 
other programs in the area but absolutely nothing in Oak Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Jensik said, however, that the list of class offerings was drawn up in 
consultation with other area adult education programs to avoid too much 
overlapping of the subjects being taught. 
</P>
<P>
 "We planned this program so that it would not infringe on anyone else's 
established adult education program," Jensik said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the classes being offered at Oak Park are five state-subsidized courses 
that will require no enrollment fee. They are a computer applications class, 
two English as a Second Language classes -- including one for language and one 
for computers -- a writing class and a contemporary history class. 
</P>
<P>
 Courses in the arts, business and marketing, health and safety, and self-help 
classes will be among the 16 classes being offered this semester, which begins 
Jan. 31. Registration starts Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oak Park Adult School also will offer a lecture series on a wide range of 
topics such as "Tax Advantages for the '90s and Beyond," "Master a Winning Job 
Interview," "Attention Deficit Disorder" and "Israeli/Arab Resolve." 
</P>
<P>
 Jensik said the district was aiming to enroll at least 25 students in each of 
the classes but that the absolute minimum number of students to keep classes 
open would be 20. 
</P>
<P>
 For registration information, call the Oak Park Unified School District at 
(818) 707-7953. ROBIN GREENE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OK SOUGHT ON REPORT FOR HOSPITAL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pushing forward with plans to expand Ventura County Medical Center, a county 
official has urged the Board of Supervisors to approve the project's 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Works Director Arthur Goulet has asked the supervisors to certify the 
report after a public hearing today, a step needed to obtain state funding for 
the $50-million project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state deadline is July 1," Goulet said. "That's not very far away." 
</P>
<P>
 But residents on Agnus Drive next to the central Ventura hospital have 
strongly opposed the expansion, claiming it will mar their ocean view and 
create pollution and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say the environmental report does not thoroughly examine alternative 
sites for the project. The expansion includes a full mental health hospital, a 
general outpatient clinic, a medical examiner's office, a morgue and a parking 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have designed that whole thing so it would not have impacted so 
seriously the residences on Agnus Drive," said James M. Farley, a Ventura 
attorney who lives on the street. "The county decided that this is where they 
wanted it to go and to hell with everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 But Goulet said the county has agreed to relocate the tallest structure -- the 
five-story parking garage -- away from the residential area. The remainder of 
the complex, Goulet said, will pose few problems to the neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is set for 10 a.m. in the supervisors' hearing room at the Ventura 
County Government Center. TINA DAUNT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; BANK ROBBER GETS 2 1/2-YEAR SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks man has been sentenced to 2 1/2 years in federal prison for 
his role in a string of 15 bank robberies in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, 
the FBI announced on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Alan Miller, 23, was arrested Aug. 9, one day after the FBI arrested his 
purported crime partner, 33-year-old Arthur Lara, also of Thousand Oaks, said 
Charlie J. Parsons, special agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller pleaded guilty in October to a single count of bank robbery, stemming 
from the Aug. 4 robbery of a Bank of America branch in Newhall, Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Judge Terry J. Hatter sentenced Miller to 30 months in federal 
prison, three years probation and ordered him to make restitution of $1,489. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was charged with just one count of bank robbery because that was the 
only time he was the "inside man," said FBI Special Agent Gary Auer. "The 
government is alleging that Lara was the individual who (usually) entered the 
bank and actually committed the robberies," Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI believes Miller was the driver during the other robberies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller and Lara are accused of starting their bank robbery spree last April at 
a Citibank branch in Sherman Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 Lara is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 1 in Los Angeles. PATRICK McCARTNEY

HOMECOMING QUEEN, 17, IS JUST ONE OF THE GUYS; NEWBURY PARK: SENIOR DANA 
ZIEGERT, THE ONLY GIRL ON THE WRESTLING TEAM, WEARS A CROWN OF RESPECT FROM HER 
PEERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dana Ziegert stuck with it as the only girl on the Newbury Park High School 
boys' wrestling team long enough to be accepted as just one of the guys, making 
the honor she won last year all the more striking. 
</P>
<P>
 "My principal said I'm the first wrestler to be voted homecoming queen," the 
17-year-old senior said. "I was really surprised to even be nominated." 
</P>
<P>
 Dana learned at halftime of the Oct. 30 homecoming football game that she had 
beaten the four other girls nominated by classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the other girls were way cool about it," Dana said. "They weren't, like, 
'Oh, you shouldn't have won.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dana started wrestling in ninth grade and is now in the middle of her fourth 
year on the squad, she said. The plan was to try it for a week and drop out if 
it wasn't fun. But she found she enjoyed the demands of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're done, you feel tired, hungry, thirsty, hot and sweaty, but it's 
such a good feeling," Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Dana kept coming back and working hard won her the respect of 
teammates and classmates who may have raised an eyebrow when she first went out 
for the squad, said wrestling Coach Marty Maciel, a biology teacher at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the toughest sport on campus, by far," Maciel said. "It's the most 
challenging and time-consuming." 
</P>
<P>
 Dana's resolve has been tested: She hasn't won many of her matches, but she 
never gave up, Maciel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy when you keep getting pinned time after time, or getting beat, 
but she kept at it," Maciel said. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't always been easy for Dana to pursue such a physical sport. Peer 
pressure took its toll in the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first couple of years, a lot of people teased her about it a lot, but 
now people look up to her because of it," said Eric Masaki, a senior who 
started on the team the same year Dana did. 
</P>
<P>
 Another senior who joined the team as a freshman said he laughed it off when 
he saw a girl trying out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'She won't make it.' And here she is, senior year," said Casey 
Waldron, 17. "She's homecoming queen and she's still wrestling, and I think 
it's pretty rad. She has a lot of character." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dana said she wasn't trying to prove anything by joining the team. She just 
wanted to participate in sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people thought I was really a women's libber," she said. "I heard a 
lot about 'Why is she doing this? Why would she want to?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is simple, Dana said. At 5-foot-2, she's too short for basketball, 
never excelled at softball or swimming, and didn't like running. Her friends 
understood, and now Dana knows that other students have come around, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any homecoming queen, Dana said she was honored to win what is typically 
considered a beauty and popularity contest. But the victory meant more than the 
chance to wear a crown for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me feel really good that people know I'm still a girl and I like to 
wear dresses," Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a December meet in Camarillo, Dana marked another milestone: Wrestling at 
130 pounds, she scored her first pin, beating a Ventura High School boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best feeling to know all this hard work paid off finally," said 
Dana, who has wrestled both varsity and junior varsity this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly gloating about the victory, Dana understood that her opponent must have 
felt uncomfortable wrestling a girl. Even her own teammates at first balked at 
the idea of grabbing, pulling and rolling around on the floor with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody really likes wrestling with a girl, which I can 
understand," said Dana, one of only a handful of female wrestlers in the 
county. "But I'm used to it. We do it in practice every day, so it's no big 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Staying with wrestling taught her important lessons about life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Maciel taught me a lot about always trying your hardest, and how you 
drill in practice is how you're going to wrestle in a meet," Dana said. "He 
said, 'You can do it, you can win, you just have to work hard.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a lot more confident because of this," she added. "I think if I can go 
through this, I can do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Wrestling may have made Dana a stronger person, but it made her mother a wreck 
-- but not because Dana is a girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would feel the same way if my son were wrestling," Luci Ziegert said. "It 
seems so physical. It makes me nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 She's proud of Dana for hanging in there, however, and for gaining the respect 
of her peers over the years, her mother said. Still, when Dana's name was 
announced as homecoming queen, Ziegert was surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not really the glamorous type, so I was floored," Ziegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Scott Ziegert, said he was touched but incredulous when his 
daughter, the wrestler, was crowned. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were to make a movie about it, everyone would walk out because it's so 
corny," her father said. "It's too far-fetched. Even Disney's smart enough not 
to do something like that."

* RAYMOND WALKER, FORMER COUNTY TAX COLLECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raymond Walker, Ventura County's treasurer and tax collector during the 1960s, 
died Saturday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
 Born on a farm in Saticoy, Walker was known as "Stringy" to his friends 
because of his tall, gaunt appearance as a young man.Except for a stint in the 
Navy during World War II and two years working in Hollywood, Walker spent his 
life in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 He started working for the county as a motorcycle police officer in 1932, then 
went to work as a security officer at Warner Bros. studios, rubbing shoulders 
with the likes of Al Jolson and Dick Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1938, he returned to Ventura and took a part-time job in the assessor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two years, Walker worked his way up to the post of deputy treasurer, a 
position he held until he joined the Navy in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 After returning from assignment in North Africa, he was appointed chief deputy 
treasurer and served in that post until being named treasurer in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later he was elected to the combined post of treasurer and tax 
collector. He was reelected in 1966 and retired in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, Dortha, and daughters Betty Pfeiler and Binney 
Moss. 
</P>
<P>
 Services will be held at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at Ted Mayr Funeral Home, 
Ventura.

* JENNIFER REED, SENIOR AT BUENA HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jennifer Reed, a Buena High School senior who recently moved to Ventura from 
Washington state with her family, was killed in an automobile accident in 
Orange County early New Year's Day, a California Highway Patrol spokesman said. 
She was 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer was returning to Ventura after visiting a friend on New Year's Eve, 
said her grandmother, Irene Reed. According to her grandmother, Jennifer was 
driving home alone about 4 a.m. Jan. 1, trying to get back to Ventura in time 
for her part-time job at an import store. The cause of the accident was under 
investigation, but family members speculated that she may have fallen asleep 
before her car swerved off the road and struck the center divider on the Orange 
Freeway near Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 After striking the divider, her car careened back onto the freeway and came to 
rest in the middle two northbound lanes of the four-lane road, said Officer 
John Gentry of the CHP. She was struck while trying to wave away oncoming cars, 
Gentry said, and pronounced dead an hour later at Brea Community Hospital in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jennifer was a wonderful lady," said Karen Birbeck, her counselor at Buena 
High School. "She was really upbeat despite having to move down here from 
Washington in her senior year. She had a lot of promise." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer was engaged to be married and had plans to attend Eastern Washington 
University in the fall, her grandmother said. She told family members she 
wanted to become a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include her mother, Cynthia Klante of Ventura, father, David Reed of 
Ojai, and a sister and brother, both of Ventura. Visitation is from noon until 
8 p.m. on Wednesday at Ted Mayr Funeral Home, Ventura. Graveside services will 
be at 11 a.m. Thursday at Ivy Lawn Cemetery in Ventura.

FREEWAY LINK DRAWS PRAISE FOR REDUCING STREET TRAFFIC; TRANSPORTATION: A STUDY 
SHOWS A SHARP REDUCTION IN CONGESTION ON SIMI VALLEY'S BUSIEST ROADWAYS AS MORE 
DRIVERS USE THE 2.2-MILE CONNECTOR TO MOORPARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two and a half months after its opening, a long-awaited link between the Simi 
Valley and Moorpark freeways is winning praise from residents and city 
officials for providing a quicker route between the cities and cutting traffic 
in half on congested city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 A study conducted by the city of Simi Valley and Caltrans last month showed 
that during peak hours, traffic fell dramatically on three of the city's 
busiest roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 During its busiest morning hour, the number of motorists traveling on Tierra 
Rejada Road plunged from 2,500 to 1,150. On Madera Road between Easy Street and 
Los Angeles Avenue, the hourly traffic rate fell from 4,000 to 2,150. And on 
Viewline Drive the 1,900 motorists traveling between Madera Road and the 
Moorpark Freeway on-ramp dropped to 1,070. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an unexpected delight" said Simi Valley traffic engineer Bill 
Golubics. "We predicted a decrease, but these numbers really exceeded our 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the study, Simi Valley officials last month decided to drop a 
lawsuit against the city of Thousand Oaks to force extension of Sunset Hills 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension was planned to offer an alternative route from Simi Valley to 
Thousand Oaks. But motorists' willingness to use the freeway connector and free 
up city streets led city officials to decide that the road extension was not 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a real timesaver," Simi Valley City Councilwoman Judy Mikels said. 
"I think it's helped keep us all a little more sane." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A similar study under way in Moorpark should be completed by the end of the 
month, Mayor Paul Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the hard numbers yet, but it's clear that it's seriously cut 
down on traffic through the downtown," Lawrason said. "It's been a tremendous 
benefit in helping people get in and out of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are equally enthusiastic about the connector. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks resident Helen Greyson said the connector has made it easier for 
her to visit her son, who lives in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I get caught in traffic, I sit there and steam and my blood pressure 
goes through the roof," the retired schoolteacher said. "So I'm not kidding -- 
the new freeway has been good for my health." 
</P>
<P>
 Conceived nearly two decades ago and opened in mid-October, the 2.2-mile 
stretch of freeway located in Moorpark took 2 1/2 years to build and cost $39.5 
million. Included in the link are a pair of bridges that soar as high as 100 
feet above the Arroyo Simi channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it opened, motorists traveling from the Moorpark Freeway to the Simi 
Valley Freeway had to follow a winding, 3.4-mile course along New Los Angeles 
Avenue, Spring Road and Los Angeles Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Transportation estimated that 23,000 vehicles per 
day were using the narrow, two-lane route. The agency predicted that the figure 
would more than triple by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is planning to install electronic traffic counters later this month 
to monitor the flow of traffic along the new connector. The devices, copper 
loops installed under the roadway, are used throughout the state highway system 
to keep track of the traffic flow, Caltrans spokesman Russ Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't done any formal studies on the connector, but traffic seems to be 
moving along quite smoothly," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from a minor drainage problem causing erosion along the banks of the 
Arroyo Simi channel, the freeway has been operating glitch-free, Caltrans 
maintenance supervisor Dave Servaes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a big deal," Servaes said of the drainage problem. "It's just one of 
those little things that doesn't show up when you're reviewing the plans." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are in the works to repair the drain soon, Servaes said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the actual connector open and running smoothly, Caltrans is concentrating 
its efforts on landscaping around the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next several months, Caltrans will pay $50,000 to plant 1,000 oak 
seedlings to replace 87 oak trees uprooted for the connector. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is working with the Ventura County Transportation Commission to come 
up with an additional $70,000 to pay for 20 acres of landscaping along the 
freeway and in nearby neighborhoods, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the funds are secured, Caltrans will confer with Moorpark officials to 
select mutually agreeable drought-tolerant trees and shrubs. Caltrans will pay 
the entire cost of maintaining the landscaping, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been part of the plan all along to plant the trees and do the other 
landscaping," Snyder said. "Now it's just a matter of getting the funds 
together and coordinating with the city."

PROPOSAL TO RENAME HISTORIC STREET CREATES HOT DEBATE; MOORPARK: THE CITY 
COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER A PLAN TO CHANGE PEACH HILL ROAD TO MESA VERDE DRIVE TO 
MATCH THAT OF A NEW SCHOOL TO OPEN NEXT FALL.

<P>
 A plan to rename part of a historic Moorpark thoroughfare to match that of a 
new middle school has drawn fire from longtime residents and city officials as 
a breach of city tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had about as many calls on this as I've had on any issue that's come 
before me," said Scott Montgomery, a City Council member since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Wednesday will consider a request to change about one-half mile 
of Peach Hill Road to Mesa Verde Drive so the name would jibe with a middle 
school to be opened next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The name-change dispute is the latest between city officials and the local 
school board. For example, the city negotiated purchase of a school site as a 
downtown park for years, but could not close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Kenneth Sherman, with the backing of the Moorpark school board, has 
pressed for the name change. The school board backed the plan by voting last 
month to spend $1,000 for new street signs if the city agrees to the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Tom Baldwin said he supports the request because it would make it 
easier for parents and students to find the new school, but he said he does not 
consider the issue a critical one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a better choice of name for the road, and I hope the city takes 
the suggestion," Baldwin said. "But if they don't, it's not a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, who served on a district committee that named new Mesa Verde Middle 
School, said he was asked by the school's principal to try to change the name 
of Peach Hill Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are growing as a city, whether we like it or not, and we need to embrace 
change," Sherman said. "I just think it'll make things easier for the parents 
that will be having children go to the new school in the years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman said the change would end confusion created by the L-shaped 
configuration of Peach Hill Road, which runs east, west, north and south at 
different points. 
</P>
<P>
 But both Montgomery and Mayor Paul Lawrason said they would be reluctant to 
change the name of such a historically significant thoroughfare, particularly 
one that carries the name of such an established neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The road has been known as Peach Hill since the early 1900s, and the Peach 
Hill neighborhood is one of the city's largest, Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a part of the way our city is, and I think the mere idea of simply 
renaming it for some convenience . . . doesn't sit with me at all," Lawrason 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason said he is concerned that the change could also be inconvenient for 
about 10 residents whose street would be renamed, as well as for two churches 
on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see the logic (behind a change)," Lawrason said. "But that doesn't 
really sway me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman said he will accept the City Council's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to shake anything up," he said.

UC IRVINE FEELS FINE AFTER BEATING TITANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine, working some magic with numbers in its Big West Conference opener 
Monday night, made 10 minutes hold up for 40 at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters seized a 20-point lead before the first wrinkle appeared in 
Titan Coach Brad Holland's suit and then made 14 of 14 second-half free-throw 
attempts -- six in a row in the final 1:43 -- to hold on, 77-71, in front of 
973 in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 But forget the details. Twenty points, 10 points, a six-point victory, Irvine 
Coach Rod Baker wasn't counting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel good," Baker said. "The fact is, this is a conference game on the 
road. That's what I told them (in the locker room afterward). Right now, we're 
in first place in the conference. Right now, somebody has got to take that away 
from us." 
</P>
<P>
 To most colleges, being in first place with a 1-0 record might not be such a 
big deal but, remember, "basketball success" in Orange County is an oxymoron 
lately. The last time Irvine occupied a 1-0 hold on first place was on Jan. 5, 
1984, when the Anteaters won their Big West opener against New Mexico State. 
This is the earliest Irvine (4-4, 1-0) has won four games since the 1987-88 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Brown, the Big West player of week after scoring 29 against Iowa on 
Wednesday, led the Anteaters with 15 points and Lloyd Mumford added 14. Winston 
Peterson led Fullerton (2-7, 0-1) with 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hall in the Fullerton locker room, Holland was just wondering when 
his players will realize that the game officially begins with the opening tip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've shown this year that we're a slow-starting team, and I don't 
understand why," said Holland, whose team trailed Oklahoma Baptist at halftime 
before coming back to win. "Once again, we didn't put 40 minutes together. 
You've got to do that, especially in this conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Monday, the closest eight of Fullerton's nine players had gotten to the 
Big West Conference was when Holland talked about it during practice. And in 
the first few minutes against Irvine, it looked as if maybe these new Titans 
had wandered into the wrong conference. 
</P>
<P>
 That, or Irvine's victory over Iowa last week was the beginning of an Anteater 
dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters, as perfect as a rainbow, scored the first 10 points against 
Fullerton and led by 20, 27-7, by the time the first-half clock wound down to 
9:11. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Fullerton's worst nightmare. The Titans didn't score a point for the 
first four minutes and only managed two in the first six. They committed 12 
turnovers, many of them unforced. There was Darren Little, dribbling off his 
foot out of bounds. There was Greg Vernon, driving the lane, going into the 
air, and firing a pass out of bounds. There was James French, stepping into the 
paint, passing up an open six-footer and passing out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, meanwhile, was cramming the ball inside at will. Junior transfer 
Jermaine Avie dropped in 10 points as easy as pitching pennies into a wishing 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 But just when things were going from rout to ridiculous, Fullerton suddenly 
pulled things together. And of all things, it was because two freshmen started 
playing like upperclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Chris St. Clair pulled down four rebounds, and forward Josh King fired 
in three consecutive three-pointers around the five-minute mark. King, a raw 
freshman, nearly matched his career-high of 10 points during the 1:44 span. 
Vernon added another three and the margin eventually shriveled to six, 34-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine wasn't surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no moment did I think those guys were going to lay down," Baker said. "You 
don't practice that hard and work that hard every day just to lay down. If they 
could settle in and stop the bleeding a little bit, they would be OK, and they 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a 10-point game at the half, 40-30, which, given the circumstances, 
couldn't have been too displeasing to either side. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 UCI Coach Rod Baker said that guards Zuri Williams and Todd Whitehead, who 
were suspended last week after being cited for shoplifting, will probably sit 
out Saturday's game against Cal State Northridge.

UCI'S MUMFORD TAKES CHARGE, PROVES HIS POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With two top guards suspended after being cited for shoplifting, the burden of 
running the UC Irvine offense the last two games has rested with Lloyd Mumford. 
And it's no coincidence that Irvine is 2-0 in those games. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford, who was the Anteaters' starting point guard last season, had been 
moved to the off-guard spot at the beginning of the season in an effort to 
improve his scoring chances. But after Mumford's performance in Irvine's 77-71 
Big West Conference victory over Cal State Fullerton Monday night, he probably 
will be back at the point for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great experiment," Coach Rod Baker said, "but Lloyd is a point guard 
and that's where he plays best." 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford scored 14 points, made 10 of 10 free-throw attempts and had nine 
assists. But his biggest contributions won't show up in the box score. The 
6-foot-2 senior took charge time and again when Fullerton was rallying. And he 
did it with about 20 seconds of rest. Mumford has played 79 minutes in Irvine's 
last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just about dead," Baker said. "I was begging him to hang in there for 
a couple of more possessions down the stretch. And he did what great players 
do. He made great plays when we needed them most." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans cut Irvine's lead to 54-52 midway through the second half when 
Mumford took over. He scored on an acrobatic drive to put Irvine up by four 
points and then went to the hoop again on the Anteaters' next possession, 
drawing a foul. He made both free throws and Irvine had some breathing room 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know playing the point is where I belong," Mumford said. "It's where I feel 
most comfortable. I've played there all my life. But I'll do whatever it takes 
now. I'll go as hard as I can for 40 minutes. I'll coach and Coach Baker can 
play. I just want to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford did some coaching, too, albeit from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 When Fullerton's press caused the tiring Mumford to commit two 
uncharacteristic turnovers in the closing minutes, he maintained his poise. And 
when the Titans cut Irvine's advantage to five points with 41 seconds left, 
Mumford signaled his teammates to clear out, weaved through the key, hung in 
the air and tossed up a lob pass to center DeForrest Boyer, who slammed it home 
and sealed Irvine's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys look to me to see how I respond in those situations," Mumford said, 
"and that's fine because I consider myself a leader on this team." 
</P>
<P>
 And from now on, he can consider himself a point guard, too.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: COACHES SEE STRONG, BALANCED 
CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A majority of the Orange Empire Conference men's basketball coaches were 
sitting together last week at the Rancho Santiago Holiday tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion quickly turned to the upcoming conference race and which team 
would win it. All agreed on two things: the conference is as strong as ever and 
no team is a runaway favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a brief look at each team on the eve of conference play (with records 
in parentheses): 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (15-4): The Hornets have the best blend of talent and experience. 
Bobby Natoya (18 points per game) and Tamar Ross (13 points) start in the 
backcourt, and Kevin Carlson (12.4 points) and Eddie Cochran (10 points and six 
rebounds) start at forward. All are sophomores who started last season. Tyrone 
Merriweather, a transfer from Los Angeles Harbor, is averaging eight rebounds 
at center. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton enters conference play having lost two of three. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside (14-4): The Tigers have the best offensive player in the conference 
in sophomore guard Darryle Flicking, who is averaging 32 points. He scored 59 
points in a game this season. Raimonds Miglinieks returns at guard to run the 
offense. Riverside has won six in a row and 12 of its last 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (12-5): The Dons have exceeded expectations. Sean Amos, a 
sophomore forward, is averaging 23 points and eight rebounds. He is one of the 
quickest inside players in the conference. Matt Kordik, another sophomore 
forward, is averaging 16 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons won five in a row before losing the final two games of their 
tournament last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley (12-6): Rashad Wilson and Tom Airey give the Lasers a solid 
backcourt, and 6-9 center Damon Sims presents match-up problems. Irvine Valley 
has won four of its last five with the loss coming to Ventura, the top-ranked 
team in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast (10-5): The Pirates, who won only five games last season, are the 
most improved team in the conference. OCC is led up front by forwards Damion 
Morbley (15 points) and Chauncey Woolridge (16 points). 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Loewe (13 points) returns to the backcourt, where he is joined by 
freshman Derek Roche (16 points). OCC started 7-2, but since then is 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (10-5): The defending champion Gauchos are the conference coaches' 
pick to repeat. They start conference play having won three in a row. Josh 
Borella returns at point guard after a year off because of back surgery. 
Antoine Jefferson (16 points and nine rebounds) is a force on the front line 
and Tes Whitlock (18 points), a transfer from Arizona State, is on the wing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (9-10): Cypress started poorly, going 1-4, but has gone 8-6 since. 
Matt Kenney and Jeff Cummins, both freshmen, are the only players with a 
scoring average in double figures. Kenney, who has 57 three-pointers, has a 
14.3 average and Cummins is averaging 13.7. Jim Falletta is back at forward and 
Chris Fry returns at center. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West (7-9): The Rustlers have improved depth compared to recent seasons 
but much of the offense falls to Gerald Rhoden, a sophomore forward. He is 
averaging 17 points and six rebounds. He scored a career-high 38 points in a 
victory over Mt. San Jacinto this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Women's basketball: In each of the last two seasons, Golden West's dominance 
was supposed to end. But last season the Rustlers won their fourth consecutive 
conference title and earned their seventh consecutive berth in the State 
tournament. Golden West lost in the semifinal round. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, things appeared bleak for Golden West, with one starter 
returning. But several players have developed quickly and the Rustlers are 
again at the front of the title chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West (18-3) is led by Deana Itow, a freshman guard, and Julie Murdent, 
a freshman center. Itow is averaging 18 points and Murdent 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West's main challengers are expected to be Riverside (17-5) and Cypress 
(15-4). Riverside and Golden West have played twice this season in tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West won, 73-67, Dec. 5, but Riverside was more impressive in a 65-45 
victory Thursday in the title game of the Fullerton tournament. The teams meet 
at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress has improved greatly because of the play of Sara Works, a freshman 
forward. She is averaging 17 points and eight rebounds.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; TWO FRESHMEN BRIGHTEN LEAN YEAR IN SWIMMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This figures to be a lean year for the chlorine gang at Irvine. The Anteater 
swim and diving teams -- men's and women's -- have a combined total of 25 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a low point, as far as numbers are concerned," Coach Charlie 
Schober said, "but I really feel very optimistic about building the team at 
this point. We're in the middle of heavy training right now and there are a lot 
of kids who are either sitting on, or have already set lifetime bests without 
resting at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Two reasons for Schober's hopes for a brighter future are freshmen Gwen 
Yoshizumi and Leisha Masi. Yoshizumi, a backstroker, already has twice bettered 
the school record in the 100-yard backstroke, and Masi, a breaststroker, has 
Irvine's top times this season in the 100- and 200-yard breaststroke and the 
200-yard individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are hoping to pick up some first-place points this weekend at the 15th 
UCI Invitational at Heritage Park in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gwen's an excellent talent," Schober said. "She's working her way through a 
shoulder problem and she's really coming into her own. She's focused and very 
disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's mainly a sprinter. She has great speed and is very good coming off the 
walls. Her strength is her underwater dolphin kick off the walls. When she 
leads off the medley relay with a 50-yard back, we're way ahead every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Masi's strength is her consistency and potential. She has bettered her 
personal best in the 200-yard breaststroke by four seconds this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leisha was a fairly average high school swimmer, but she's a very hard 
worker, a great competitor and she puts out her very best effort in every 
workout," Schober said. "And that work ethic is paying off now." 
</P>
<P>
 Both swimmers came from successful high school programs and found the 
adjustment to competition at Irvine a bit of a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of had my mind set on going to UC San Diego, but I applied here, too, 
and Charlie talked to me a lot about the contribution I could make here," Masi 
said. "It's been a little frustrating, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "My high school team (Riverside Poly) had about 40 girls on it and we were 
used to winning, so it's really different. You have to concentrate on the fact 
that each swimmer doing his best is more important than winning all the meets. 
It's hard, though, because I'm very, very competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshizumi, who attended Walnut and swims with the Brea Aquatics club team, 
also has had to work on lowering her expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came here for my recruiting trip, the team did not look this small," 
she said, watching her teammates prepare for a workout. "In high school, we had 
a big team. It seemed like just about all the girls went out for swimming. And 
we had so many people, we usually won the meets easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first couple of meets here were weird when you start noticing that 
individually, you're all first or second, but you just don't have the numbers 
to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Both swimmers are self-described late-bloomers and Schober hopes they will be 
the foundation of a program on the way up. Masi's improvement can be traced to 
mental maturity and Yoshizumi says she has been serious about swimming for only 
a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't start swimming competitively until sixth grade and I didn't really 
take it seriously until the summer before my senior year in high school," 
Yoshizumi said. "But I decided I wanted to swim in college, so I've really been 
working hard ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Masi: "I used to go to big meets and just choke. I felt like throwing up 
and crying before every race. But for the last two years, I've been able to go 
to big meets and perform well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in better shape, and I've gotten a lot stronger, but I've gotten mentally 
tougher and that's really helped. Now, I just don't let myself get psyched 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Numbers Game: The numbers on his swim teams may be on the decline, but the 
Schober family increased by one at 8:48 Monday morning. Schober's wife, Sue, 
gave birth to their second child, an eight-pound, four-ounce boy. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday afternoon, Charlie and his wife were still debating on a name. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Quinn: Think men's volleyball Coach Andy Read is excited that 
Leland Quinn has decided to return to the team after a year's hiatus? 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the potential to dominate at his position (opposite hitter)," Read 
said. "He's one of those guys you can throw the ball to when you don't get the 
pass right where you want it and just say, 'Hit it, big fella.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Every good team has a player like that, the kind of guy who can score on 
those off plays for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn, a 6-foot-9 junior who played at Ocean View High, set the school 
career-kill record in only two seasons at Irvine. Read said he quit the team 
because of academic difficulties and a slight case of burnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no scholarship money and he just needed to get away for a year," 
Read said. "But he would come by the office and talk and I was mainly concerned 
with getting him back into school. I told him I could call some other places if 
he wanted, but he's a very loyal kid. He's loyal to his friends and loyal to 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then one day he came in and said he had decided he wanted to play again and 
decided he wanted to play here." 
</P>
<P>
 You can bet that made Read's day. 
</P>

 Ouch Patrol: Junior forward Jinelle Williams, the top rebounder (8.5 per game) 
and No. 2 scorer (11.7) on the women's basketball team, has missed the last two 
games because of tendinitis in both knees. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Sherise Sandoz made her first two starts of the season replacing 
Williams and totaled 25 points with 14 rebounds in losses to Drake and No. 5 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is expected to return Thursday night when the Anteaters (1-7) open 
Big West Conference play against defending champion UC Santa Barbara (3-5) at 
the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Marc-Andre Tardif is No. 47 in the country in singles, according to 
the latest Rolex Collegiate coaches' poll. The Irvine men's tennis team is 
ranked No. 25.

CHAMBERS, MALONE HELP UTAH TO FIFTH STRAIGHT VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Chambers scored 20 points and Karl Malone added 19 as the Utah Jazz handed 
the Dallas Mavericks their 26th loss in 28 games, 115-85, Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was Utah's fifth straight, ninth in its last 10 games and 10th 
straight at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Jackson led the Mavericks with 23 points, and Jamal Mashburn added 20 
points and nine rebounds as Dallas dropped its third game to the Jazz this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks got within 60-52 with 7:21 left in the third quarter, when 
Popeye Jones was called for elbowing Karl Malone in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Coach Quinn Buckner was assessed a technical for protesting, and Derek 
Harper also drew a technical. John Stockton made three of the four free throws 
to put Utah ahead, 63-52. The incident came about two minutes after Dallas 
center Greg Dreiling was assessed with two technicals and ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas got within 10 again at 66-56 with 5:59 left in the third quarter, but 
Utah outscored the Mavericks 20-11 through the end of the quarter to lead 
86-67. Jeff Malone, Jay Humphries and Felton Spencer each had four points in 
the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah took its largest lead at 113-81 with 1:06 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Malone scored 13 points, and John Stockton, Bryon Russell, Spencer and 
Corbin each added 10 for Utah. Stockton had 12 assists for his seventh 
consecutive double-double. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah held Dallas to 36% shooting for the game, six for 24 in the fourth 
quarter. Karl Malone played only 30 minutes, but that was the most of any Jazz 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 Mashburn, who was six of nine from the floor in the first half, was two of 
eight in the second half. Fat Lever was one of 10 and Derek Harper three of 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah has won 11 consecutive games over Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-4 run by Utah in the first 7:11 of the second quarter, led by Karl Malone 
and Chambers with four points each, put the Jazz ahead 39-25. A three-pointer 
by Stockton and a three-point play by Chambers gave the Jazz its largest lead 
of the half, 45-29 with 4:46 remaining. The Mavericks then outscored Utah 11-7 
to get within 52-41 at halftime.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BOND YIELDS JUMP; GOLD, SILVER GAIN

<P>
 Market Overview * Bond investors entered the new year in a sour mood, dumping 
bonds on new signs of economic strength. Yields jumped to nearly five-month 
highs. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. stocks closed mostly lower, hurt by a renewed selloff in small growth 
stocks. Overseas, most foreign markets started the new year with rallies, 
except in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 * Silver soared to a five-month high, and gold and oil also gained. The dollar 
rallied sharply against major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit  
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bond yields rose across the board as investors viewed strong new 
reports on the economy as pointing to higher interest rates in '94. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's main 30-year bond jumped to 6.42% from 6.35% on 
Friday, continuing a rise that accelerated late last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the bond's yield was this high was Aug. 12, when it closed at 
6.44%. 
</P>
<P>
 Among shorter-term bonds, the yield on five-year T-notes surged to 5.31% from 
5.20% on Friday, and one-year T-bill yields surged to 3.64% from 3.59%. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said sellers who had sat out last week's thinly traded holiday market 
joined the fray Monday, pushing yields up from the outset of trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds' troubles accelerated with the midmorning release of two economic 
reports that support the view of a growing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Purchasing Management said its monthly survey shows 
continued expansion in the manufacturing sector in December. The government 
also said construction spending rose 1.8% in November for the seventh 
consecutive monthly advance. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing barrage of improving economic statistics over the past month 
has boosted expectations that 1994 will be a strong year for the economy -- 
raising the likelihood of higher inflation and the likelihood that the Federal 
Reserve Board will tighten credit for the first time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bond investors, anticipating higher rates, appear to be trying to exit 
the market now, perhaps with the idea of re-entering later in 1994 if yields do 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts insist there is still no basis for worry about either rising 
inflation or a Fed tightening. But in the near term, the bond selloff may take 
on a life of its own, analysts concede. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're looking for something positive for the bond market, it is tough to 
find," said Jim Kenney, head government securities trader at Prudential 
Securities. The market's next big hit could come Friday, when the government 
reports on December job growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials managed to close higher, but nearly all other key market 
indexes slumped as bond yields rose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow added 2.51 points to 3,756.60, rallying back in the final minutes from 
what looked like a certain loss. But the Nasdaq market of mostly smaller stocks 
suffered a broad hit after last week's sharp rally. The Nasdaq composite index 
tumbled 6.04 points to 770.76. Losers well outnumbered winners on both Nasdaq 
and the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said investors were disappointed by the bond market's continuing 
selloff. As interest rates rise, stocks lose their luster. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, many traders may have been buying smaller stocks last week in 
anticipation of a traditional January rally in those issues. When the Nasdaq 
market failed to rally early Monday, some traders may have bailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Streeters say the market remains vulnerable to rising interest rates, at 
least until fourth-quarter corporate earnings reports begin to roll in 
mid-month. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Smaller-company growth stocks that suffered renewed selloffs included 
Snapple Beverage, off 3/4 to 25 1/2; America On-Line, off 2 1/2 to 56; Cott, 
down 1 1/2 to 22 7/8; International Game Technology, off 1 1/8 to 28 3/8, and 
restaurant chain Fresh Choice, down 2 to 25 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many computer-related stocks were weak. Compaq fell 1 to 72 7/8, Cabletron 
Systems lost 3 to 109 1/2, Motorola tumbled 3 5/8 to 88 5/8, Lotus dropped 1 
1/2 to 53 1/2 and Powersoft sank 2 to 38 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Major retail stocks gave ground. Dillard lost 2 to 36, Nordstrom fell 1 to 
32, J.C. Penney eased 1 1/8 to 51 1/2 and Sears fell 1 5/8 to 51 1/4. Toys R Us 
fell 7/8 to 40 after it named Michael Goldstein, its vice chairman, to succeed 
Charles Lazarus as CEO. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the upside, gold mining stocks started the year with a bang, with gold 
and silver prices rising further. ASA leaped 3 5/8 to 52 7/8, American Barrick 
surged 1 3/4 to 30 1/8 and Sunshine Mining jumped 1/2 to 3 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some bargain hunters sought refuge in consumer products stocks, many of 
which were the market's worst performers last year. Philip Morris jumped 2 to 
57 7/8, Merck gained 7/8 to 35 1/4, General Mills added 1 1/8 to 61 7/8 and 
Nike was up 1/2 to 46 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, the red-hot buying that closed 1993 spilled into the first trading 
day of the new year. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index surged 198.10 points to 
a record 12,086.49. New highs were also hit in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Madrid, 
Paris and Zurich, among other markets. London and Tokyo markets were closed for 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Mexico City market's dive in the wake of peasant uprisings also 
clipped shares of Mexican companies and investment funds trading in the United 
States. Telmex dropped 2 to 65 1/2, the Mexico Fund lost 2 to 37 and the 
Emerging Mexico Fund sank 2 to 23 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 New signs of a strengthening U.S. economy drove up silver prices, which posted 
five-month highs. March silver futures leaped 13.3 cents to $5.25 an ounce at 
New York's Comex. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, February gold futures added $2.80 to $394.70 an ounce, after 
retreating from a five-month trading high of $396. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver and gold both have many industrial uses that could cause increased 
demand for the metals in 1994 if the economy continues to expand. Also, some 
investors use the metals as hedges against possible higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil prices rebounded on talk that OPEC might move up its scheduled March 
meeting to late January or early February to cope with the glutted crude 
market. February light, sweet crude oil futures rose 39 cents to $14.56 a 
barrel on the New York Merc. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cold weather in Florida sent January orange juice futures up 8.25 cents to 
$1.13 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar ended the first trading day of 1994 on a strong note. It closed 
at 1.744 German marks in New York, up from 1.739 on Friday. It also rose to 
112.60 Japanese yen in New York from 111.83 on Friday, and early today in Tokyo 
it crossed the 113-yen level.

 Short-Term Treasury Rates Rise: Interest rates on short-term Treasury 
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in more than a 
month.The Treasury Department sold $12.6 billion in new three-month bills at an 
average discount rate of 3.10%, up from 3.06% last week. Another $12.6 billion 
in new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 3.29%, up from 
3.21% last week. The new discount rates understate the actual return to 
investors: 3.17% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for 
$9,921.60, and 3.39% for a six-month bill selling for $9,833.70. The discount 
rate reflects the price discount received when government securities are 
purchased at less than face value.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND JAMES BATES: COMPANY TOWN; EYES ON VIACOM AS 
PARAMOUNT WAR REVIVES 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 After a holiday cease-fire in the marathon battle for Paramount Communications 
Inc., analysts and others look for Viacom Inc. to raise the stakes or cry 
"uncle" as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some insiders are betting that Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone will pull out 
of the competition with QVC Network Inc. before bidding up a price that's 
already reached "never-never land," as he recently put it. But sources say the 
Viacom chairman still has some aces in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 One intriguing scenario has Redstone financing a higher bid with bank loans 
instead of outside investments, because the interest would be deductible. 
Redstone's main bankers -- which include Citibank, Morgan Guaranty and Bank of 
New York -- have already extended enough credit for him to best QVC's offer if 
he chooses to take that route. 
</P>
<P>
 Banking sources say Redstone might be able to tap as much as $1 billion to $2 
billion from the lenders, since he didn't take all of the credit they initially 
extended. But the same sources say it's unlikely he will borrow much more, 
because the banks would exact stiff guarantees, including shorter periods to 
repay the money and various restrictive covenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the Paramount bidding has reached as much as $10.2 billion in the 
last few weeks. Lisbeth R. Barron, an entertainment analyst at S.G. Warburg & 
Co. in New York, says that, based on current stock prices, Redstone needs about 
$600 million in cash to take back the lead from QVC, plus a way of guaranteeing 
the value of the stock investors would receive. But Barron is also skeptical 
that Redstone would be able to raise the full amount through bank financing. 
</P>
<P>
 She estimates that the Viacom chairman would be able to borrow only $200 
million to $300 million because of public debt agreements with borrowers and 
internal fears that the company would become too highly leveraged. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bank option would guarantee Redstone full management control of 
Paramount, sources say he remains in discussions with his two investors -- 
Blockbuster Entertainment and Nynex -- about increasing their stakes in the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday, there were no signs of an agreement. One reason: All sides were 
said to be regrouping following holiday vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the current pace of the talks, some sources speculate that Redstone 
will take his decision down to the wire -- meaning Friday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount gained 50 cents a share on Monday, closing at $78.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom Class A shares eased 12.5 cents to $48.75, and Viacom Class B lost 87.5 
cents to $44. QVC added 25 cents to $39.50. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Top Blockbuster executives were scheduled late Monday to check into New York's 
Peninsula Hotel for what are expected to be intense strategy sessions with 
Viacom over the next couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel has become the company's residence of choice in the Big Apple, and 
for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in September, executives were unexpectedly kicked out of the St. Regis 
Hotel because the hotel was booked and they hadn't made arrangements to stay 
another night. The St. Regis ended up sending them over to the Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Viacom does forgo making a higher bid, Redstone will have a few brash 
statements to answer for. One in particular is his Nostradamus-like declaration 
that it would take a "nuclear attack" to prevent Viacom from acquiring 
Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was another Redstone declaration of confidence in September in 
which he said, "Short of a bullet going through me, this merger's going to take 
place."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount is also the focus of an article in February's Vanity Fair magazine, 
in which contributing editor Bryan Burrough reports that the company nearly 
merged with NBC before the current battle.

 Burrough quotes Paramount Chairman Martin Davis as saying he came razor-close 
to acquiring 51% of NBC in 1992, in a deal quietly negotiated with General 
Electric Chairman Jack Welch. The agreement reportedly fell apart because of 
regulatory blockades. "This was real. We had a deal. It blew apart at the 11th 
hour," Davis said in the article. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis also told Burrough that Tele-Communications Inc. Chief Executive John 
Malone leaked details of QVC's planned bid to him as part of his independent 
effort to strike a deal with Paramount. According to the article, Malone at one 
time hoped to pair Paramount with TCI, the TCI-owned Liberty Media or Turner 
Broadcasting, which is also partly owned by TCI. 
</P>
<P>
 While Burrough reports that Paramount courted, or was courted by, such 
companies as Thorn EMI, Bertelsmann, Sony, CBS, ABC, McGraw-Hill, Gannett, AT&T 
and even Time Warner, it's Davis' frank and insulting appraisals of certain 
industry colleagues that are often most memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 On Malone: "The guy is a genius -- but then, so was Al Capone. He's the 
smartest guy you'll ever meet. He's brilliant. But he stands for nothing, 
believes in nothing and has contempt for anyone that walks and talks." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sony President Norio Ogha: "I know (Ogha) speaks English. There's nothing 
more irritating than talking to a man who knows exactly what you're saying but 
just gives you this look." 
</P>
<P>
 On Ted Turner: "As I got to know him, I learned to make sure I got him in the 
right mood swing, or he'll be crazy. He's on lithium, you know. When we got to 
talking, he'd get so excited I thought he'd have an unregulated orgasm."

RUZEK MAKES MOST OF HIS SECOND CHANCE; PRO FOOTBALL: HIS 28-YARD FIELD GOAL 
WITH NO TIME LEFT IN OVERTIME LIFTS EAGLES OVER 49ERS, 37-34, AFTER PENALTY 
NULLIFIES MISS ON PREVIOUS PLAY.

 Roger Ruzek made good on a second-chance 28-yard field goal with no time left 
in overtime Monday night to give the Philadelphia Eagles a 37-34 victory over 
the playoff-bound San Francisco 49ers in the last game of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments earlier, Ruzek missed a 38-yard attempt, but the Eagles got another 
chance when the 49ers' Merton Hanks was penalized for roughing the kicker after 
leaping to try to block the kick. 
</P>
<P>
 After the penalty, Ruzek connected on the winner to send the 49ers (10-6) into 
the postseason with losses in three of their last four games, including the 
last two. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (8-8), recovering from a midseason tailspin caused by a wave of 
injuries, ended the season with three consecutive victories to avoid their 
first losing season since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly lost in the wild finish was Steve Young of the 49ers winning a third 
consecutive NFL passing title -- something no other quarterback has done -- and 
the relief performance by his backup, Steve Bono, who directed two scoring 
drives in the final 4:41 to force overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two couldn't bail out a porous defense and misfiring kicker Mike 
Cofer. Although he connected on a 29-yard field goal with 12 seconds to play in 
regulation, he missed a 47-yard attempt in the fourth quarter and a 32-yarder 
that would have ended it after Bono guided the 49ers deep into the Eagles' 
territory on the opening possession of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Cofer's second miss opened the door for Philadelphia. Bubby Brister, who 
passed for 350 yards and three touchdowns and completed 26 of 43 passes, moved 
the Eagles 68 yards in nine plays to set up Ruzek's winning kick. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37 points were the most given up by the 49ers this season, surpassing the 
30 scored by Atlanta in a 37-30 San Francisco victory on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their weak finish, the 49ers remained locked in as the NFC's 
second-seeded team. They will have a first-round playoff bye before playing 
either the Minnesota Vikings, the New York Giants or the Detroit Lions in a 
divisional playoff game Jan. 15 at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Young passed for two touchdowns, completing 15 of 19 passes for 165 yards, and 
finished with a 101.5 rating, the third consecutive season he has had a ranking 
above 100, also an NFL first. He edged Dallas' Troy Aikman, who ended the 
season with a 99.0 rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing late in the second quarter, 24-3, the 49ers fought back to tie the 
score at 24-24 as Young capped a 21-point run with a 38-yard touchdown pass to 
John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 With that pass, Young became the first 49er quarterback to pass for more than 
4,000 yards in a season, ending the season with 4,023. He surpassed Joe 
Montana's previous club record of 3,944 during the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Brister eluded pressure to complete a short pass to James Joseph, who turned 
it into a 48-yard gain, and Herschel Walker caught a pass in the flat and went 
21 yards for the score to give Philadelphia a 31-24 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruzek kicked a 32-yard field goal with 1:16 to play in the third quarter to 
make it 34-24.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; OILERS' RYAN HAS ONLY FIGHTING WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan, defensive coordinator for the Houston Oilers, was not in an 
apologetic mood Monday. His few words carried more sting than the punch he 
threw at Oiler offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference called to clear the air, Houston Coach Jack Pardee did 
his part, saying he hoped everyone on the Oilers realized that the enemy was 
the other team. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbride was appropriately contrite. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said my part about it last night, and that's all I have to say," he said. 
Asked what he thought of the play calling by Gilbride in the first half of the 
24-0 victory over the New York Jets that led to the heated exchange, Ryan said: 
"I think actions speak louder than words." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan then strode from the lectern to a roomful of laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Not laughing was Oiler owner Bud Adams. "I am very concerned and disappointed 
about the incident that took place last night between Buddy Ryan and Kevin 
Gilbride," Adams said in a prepared statement. "I understand that what took 
place occurred during the heat of battle, but that does not excuse it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan openly dislikes Houston's run-and-shoot offense, calling it the "chuck 
and duck," and he was unhappy with Gilbride's play-calling deep in Oiler 
territory. He said something to Gilbride when the Jets recovered quarterback 
Cody Carlson's fumble at the Oiler 18 with 37 seconds to play in the half. 
Gilbride answered, and Ryan threw a punch that glanced off of Gilbride's left 
cheek.

general manager and announce the fate of Coach Joe Bugel before the Super Bowl 
on Jan. 30. . . . The Cowboys' Smith is joined in the backfield by Ram rookie 
Jerome Bettis on the Associated Press All-Pro team.

 Police are investigating charges that soccer referees were told to rig the 
outcome of key games in Brazil, including qualifying rounds for the national 
championships, but having a public panel take part in the investigation does 
not sit well with Eduardo Viana, the Rio Soccer Federation president. 
</P>

 "I detest public opinion," Viana said. "The people could all be shot by 
machine guns, for all I care. . . . I'm the son of a factory owner, the elite,

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; RED WINGS' FEDOROV EARNS KUDOS FOR CARRYING TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many NHL teams will hit the midpoint of the season this week, an occasion that 
calls for compliments and condemnations. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been some memorable moments -- Toronto's record 10-0 start, Dominik 
Hasek's five shutouts in 12 games. And there have been some forgettable ones, 
too -- the on-ice officials' strike, a rash of head-butting incidents and the 
Edmonton Oilers' threats to move to Minnesota. The two newest expansion teams 
are flourishing, but franchises in Hartford, Winnipeg and Washington are 
wobbling. And will anyone ever admit to being a New Jersey Devil fan? 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Lemieux had to curtail his return from back surgery, and he probably 
won't try again until March. Buffalo's Pat LaFontaine underwent season-ending 
knee surgery and St. Louis' Phil Housley was told he needs a back operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the Detroit Red Wings were without Steve Yzerman for 26 games 
because of a neck injury, they gained a superstar in Sergei Fedorov, who is 
jockeying with Wayne Gretzky for the scoring lead. Grant Fuhr's injured left 
knee kept him out of Buffalo's lineup, but that gave Hasek a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some noteworthy feats and failures, with appropriate awards: 
</P>
<P>
 Mini MVP: Fedorov. Runners-up: Gretzky, Patrick Roy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fedorov carried the Red Wings during Yzerman's absence. With Yzerman fit, 
Detroit's offense is scary. Gretzky enjoyed a revival after sitting out most of 
last season because of back problems, leaving him 19 goals from Gordie Howe's 
record of 801. Roy's goaltending, a carry-over from his MVP performance last 
spring, is all that keeps the Canadiens afloat most nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie of the half year: Alexei Yashin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottawa's rookie center is tough to move off the puck, skillful and half of a 
potent 1-2 punch with fellow rookie Alexandre Daigle. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach of the half year: Mike Keenan. Runners-up: Bob Gainey, Scotty Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan's Rangers have the NHL's best record, but how long can he bully them 
into winning? Gainey has guided an average team to the league's fourth-highest 
point total and Bowman is doing an outstanding job of keeping the Red Wings' 
fragile egos in line. If their goaltending improves, they will be a force. 
</P>
<P>
 Half Norris: Chris Chelios. Runners-up: Garry Galley, Brian Leetch. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's Chelios is probably the NHL's best all-around defenseman. Galley is 
a leader for the young Flyers and Leetch, after being benched by Keenan early 
in the season, has regained his Norris-winning form. 
</P>
<P>
 Demi-Vezina: Hasek. Honorable mention: Curtis Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasek, who has a 1.80 goals-against average in 26 games, can become the first 
European-trained goalie to post the NHL's lowest average. The Blues made Joseph 
face a record 2,202 shots in 68 games last season -- an average of 32.4 -- and 
they are deserting him again. He has faced 1,194 shots in 34 games, an average 
of 35.1, but his goals-against average is a respectable 3. EXPANSION EXPLOITS 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL expanded, so whynot expand the standard awards list? 
</P>
<P>
 MVP, expansion category: John Vanbiesbrouck of the Florida Panthers and Terry 
Yake, Anatoli Semenov and Coach Ron Wilson of the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalie Vanbiesbrouck has given Florida credibility and a shot at a playoff 
berth. Yake and Semenov give the Ducks creativity and Wilson gives them a calm, 
concentrated presence behind the bench. He has devised the perfect road 
strategy, a cautious style calculated to frustrate teams trying to please their 
home fans. THUMBS UP, THUMBS DOWN 
</P>
<P>
 Kudos to Pittsburgh's Joey Mullen, who needs 43 points to become the first 
U.S.-born player to score 1,000; the Rangers' Mike Gartner, the sixth NHL 
player to score 600 goals; the Capitals' Randy Burridge, dogged as ever after 
surgery on both knees; Boston's Cam Neely, who has 26 goals in 22 games despite 
a sore left leg, and Hartford's Geoff Sanderson, whose 27 goals represent a 
hefty 23% of the Whalers' offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Boos start with Winnipeg's Teemu Selanne, who had 76 goals last season but has 
only 21 this season. He and teammate Bob Essensa, who has a 3.59 goals-against 
average, showed no class in refusing to talk to reporters after a victory last 
week. Also, the maddeningly inconsistent Vancouver Canucks; the feuding Jets, 
who have put Coach John Paddock's job in jeopardy, and the Quebec Nordiques, 
who have too much talent to be 17-17-5. BE GLAD IT WASN'T A JAVELIN 
</P>
<P>
 Blackhawk goalie Ed Belfour threw his stick toward Coach Darryl Sutter after 
Sutter had pulled him less than five minutes into a game at Winnipeg, Belfour's 
hometown, but Sutter managed to smile about it the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 After learning that Belfour had not been added to the Western Conference 
All-Star team, Sutter laughed as he told the Chicago Tribune: "I hope he 
doesn't throw his stick at anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Belfour wasn't contrite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still upset about it and I don't understand what he did," he said. "We're 
both competitors and sometimes we're going to step on the other's toes. In the 
end, we want the same things, and we'll have to try and find a way to do it 
together." DINO'S NO DINOSAUR 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit winger Dino Ciccarelli, who is two goals away from 500, is in awe of 
the company he is about to join. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the guys who have scored 500 goals -- Gordie Howe, Phil Esposito, 
Bobby Hull. I watched them play when I was a kid," said Ciccarelli, who will 
turn 34 next month. "That's a pretty good group of guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Ciccarelli has perked up since he was put on a line with Fedorov and 
Viacheslav Kozlov. He had 13 points in his first 24 games, but has 16 in 12 
games with his new linemates. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 The Met Center in Bloomington, Minn., the North Stars' home from 1967 until 
1993, probably will be razed this spring. . . . The St. Louis Blues have an eye 
on Hartford defenseman Zarley Zalapski. . . . Jocelyn Lemieux asked the 
Blackhawks to trade him after he was benched last week. . . . Eric Lindros has 
only two goals in eight games since returning from a knee injury. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Plante would have benefited more by joining the U.S. Olympic team 
instead of being Buffalo's third-line center. . . . Lemieux's new contract 
includes payments of $4 million on Sept. 1, 1996, and $4 million 30 days after 
he plays his last game. Interest on that $8 million will start accruing on 
Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian Olympic team, humiliated by a 2-0 loss to France in the Izvestia 
tournament, welcomed Canuck holdout Petr Nedved, who was born in Czechoslovakia 
but became a Canadian in July. Centering for Mighty Duck draftee Paul Kariya 
and former King Chris Kontos, he had 10 points in his first four games. Kariya 
had 13 points in his first 10.

Stanley will not be involved with coaching, said Stanford Coach Tara

game will be good," Stanley said. "I'm looking forward to promoting women's 
basketball."

 An exhibition between the United States and Colombia at Miami on Feb. 20 was

 Adam Graves' tie-breaking goal 43 seconds into the third period spoiled the 
return of former Ranger John Vanbiesbrouck, who made 51 saves in New York's 3-2 
victory against the Florida Panthers on Monday night in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Richter had 25 saves for the Rangers, who extended their home unbeaten 
streak to 16 games (13-0-3), while snapping the Panthers' road unbeaten string 
at seven (5-0-2).

 Romano, a 31-year-old who played for the Boston Bruins in 1987, helped the 
Penguins end a four-game winless skid.

 The score was tied, 1-1, at the start of the third period, but Joe Mullen 
converted a one-handed pass from Ron Francis 20 seconds into the period and 
Jaromir Jagr scored at 10:23 on a breakaway.

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON: UCLA'S GYMNASTS WANT STRONG FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it was the flips and handstands Steve McCain did as a child on the front 
lawn of his parents' house in Missouri City, Tex., that prompted McCain's 
mother to consider gymnastics lessons for him. 
</P>
<P>
 But when McCain jumped off a bed and grabbed a chandelier, ripping it out of 
the ceiling, that was the clincher. 
</P>
<P>
 She promptly enrolled her 10-year-old son in classes at a local gym. Now, 
nearly nine years later, McCain is a probable future Olympian. 
</P>
<P>
 McCain, a sophomore on the UCLA men's gymnastics team, won the high bar 
competition last season at the NCAA championships with a score of 9.75. 
</P>
<P>
 And he will lead the Bruins in their grand finale this season. The gymnastics 
program will be eliminated, along with the men's swimming program, after this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, McCain chose UCLA because of its strong gymnastics tradition. The 
program has produced eight Olympians in the last 30 years. And before last 
season, UCLA had finished in the top 10 in the nation for 13 consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although McCain said that he will miss competing for UCLA after this season, 
his first priority is no longer collegiate competition, but international 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really fun competing in the NCAA. Any time something goes like that, 
it's very sad," said McCain, who will remain at UCLA and train with Bruin 
assistant coach Yefim Furman after this season. "As long as my surroundings are 
still set, where I can train and everything, I'm not going to spend a lot of 
time worrying about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins, however, will try to go out with a bang. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the makings of a team that could win the national championship this 
year," said 30-year veteran coach Art Shurlock, who won national championships 
in 1984 and '87. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins suffered a big loss when U.S. national team member Chainey Umphrey, 
who placed second in the all-around at last season's NCAA championships, 
finished his eligibility last season. Still, they are ranked No. 4 in the 
nation in College Sports magazine's preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has two members of the U.S. national team on its roster, McCain and 
junior Mike DeNucci, as well as a member of the Canadian national team, 
freshman Doug Macey. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins will begin their season on Jan. 21 in a Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation dual meet at Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is not uncommon for two siblings to compete for the same NCAA Division I 
school. It is rare, however, when both are All-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the case, though, with Kyle and Richelle Depold, brother and sister 
from Scotia, N.Y., who are on the UCLA men's and women's swim teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle, a senior, was an All-American last season as a member of the Bruins' 
200-meter freestyle relay team that set a school record, finishing in second 
place at the NCAA championships in 1 minute 17.94 seconds. Kyle transferred to 
UCLA from the University of Buffalo before last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Richelle, a sophomore, won the 50-meter freestyle at the Pacific 10 meet last 
season in a school-record 22.58 and finished third in the event at the NCAA 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle and Richelle will compete together when the UCLA men and women play host 
to Nebraska in a combined dual meet, Wednesday, beginning at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA men will then swim against visiting Michigan on Friday at 1 p.m. in 
one of the biggest dual meets of the season. At last season's NCAA meet, 
Michigan finished second to Stanford and UCLA fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA women will not compete again until Jan. 28, when they play host to 
Cal. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount's women's basketball team pulled out of a seven-game losing 
streak by winning two of its last three games.  
</P>
<P>
 The victories were over New Mexico, 52-43, on Dec. 22, and Wayland Baptist of 
Texas, 90-77, on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Against Wayland Baptist, an NAIA team, the Lions (3-8) shot a school-record 
59.7% from the floor and Marlee Webb, a sophomore guard, tied a school record 
with 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions have a good chance to continue their winning ways when they play 
host to Cal State Northridge (1-10), Thursday, at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're starting to play teams that we're going to be able to play with," 
Coach Todd Corman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount opens West Coast Conference play on Jan. 14 at St. Mary's.

 The Adidas Invitational men's tennis tournament usually provides a preseason 
glimpse of some of the nation's top collegiate players, and this year is no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament, set for Jan. 19-23 at the Hyatt Grand Champions Resort at 
Indian Wells, features second-ranked Chad Clark of Texas and fifth-ranked Wayne 
Black of USC, the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Most members of the USC team, which is ranked third, and Pepperdine, ranked 
12th, are expected to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Other notable collegiate entries include 10th-ranked Brandon Coupe of San Jose 
State, 14th-ranked Casey Louie of Cal and 19th-ranked Paul Robinson of Texas 
Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 Singles and doubles champions will receive wild-card entries into the main 
draw of the $1.8-million ATP Newsweek Champions Cup, Feb. 28-March 6, at Indian

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: DOMINGUEZ GIRLS MIGHT HAVE WON TOO MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Compton Dominguez girls' basketball team might have set a state record for 
playing the most games in a month. The Dons capped a busy December by winning 
the Los Angeles Invitational Division B title last Thursday and running their 
record to 16-1. They opened the season Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody keeps asking me if the girls are tired," said Albert Turner, 
Dominguez's second-year coach. "But it's very hard to tell with girls. I told 
them they could skip practice on New Year's Day, and they got mad at me." 
</P>
<P>
 After several nonleague victories, Dominguez started a busy tournament 
schedule by winning the Las Vegas Holiday Classic. The Dons followed that up 
with titles at the Santa Ana Calvary Chapel tournament and L.A. Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 By playing on almost every available day in December, the Dons wound up 
practicing on game days. Turner said his young team needed the time together on 
the court. Forward Markisha Woods is the team's only senior. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 17 games in 28 days might have violated Southern Section rules. A team 
may not play more than six games in a tournament, and the Dons played seven at 
Las Vegas. Dean Crowley, section commissioner, said he is reviewing the team's 
schedule. If a violation is found, he said, the school might have to cancel a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of local boys' basketball teams -- Compton Dominguez and Crenshaw -- 
gained national recognition during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez upset top-seeded Oak Hill Academy of Virginia in the second round of 
the Las Vegas Invitational two weeks ago, 65-48. Oak Hill had begun the 
tournament as the top-rated team in the country. Dominguez lost the next day, 
however, to Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw replaced Oak Hill as the No. 1 team in USA Today's ratings last week 
after winning the Palms Classic tournament in Ft. Meyers, Fla. But the Cougars 
faltered last week at the Beach Ball Classic in Myrtle Beach, S.C., losing 
twice and finishing fourth.  
</P>
<P>
 After losing to Philadelphia Simon Gratz in the semifinals, Crenshaw Coach 
Willie West benched center Kristaan Johnson for disciplinary reasons. Without 
Johnson, the City 4-A player of the year in 1992-93, Crenshaw lost to Richland 
Northeast of South Carolina in the third-place game, 74-65. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a coaching decision," West said of benching Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Mater Dei replaced Crenshaw as the Southland's top team. The 
Monarchs improved to 14-0 by defeating Long Beach Wilson in the championship 
game of the Orange tournament last Thursday at Chapman University, 82-60. 
</P>
<P>
 An already talented Mater Dei team has been helped by the addition of Schea 
Cotton, a freshman who recently transferred from St. John Bosco in Bellflower. 
Cotton, a 6-foot-5 forward, made his debut with the Monarchs on Dec. 22, coming 
off the bench to score 17 points in a victory over Orange El Modena. He started 
against Wilson and scored 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Another team to watch is Westchester, which has won nine in a row since 
starting the season 4-3. The Comets lost to Mater Dei and Los Alamitos in the 
Tournament of Champions in Huntington Beach in mid-December but won the Las 
Vegas Invitational and the Lakewood Artesia tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester defeated East Anchorage of Alaska, 83-81, in double overtime in 
the final of the Los Vegas Invitational two weeks ago, and knocked off 
Inglewood in the Artesia championship game last Thursday, 66-53. 
</P>
<P>
 "We returned four starters and seven players this season, so we expected to be 
good," Westchester Coach Ed Azzam said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Hearlihy asked her girls' basketball team at Mission Hills Alemany to 
make a big commitment this season to winning a Southern Section championship. 
So Hearlihy was not about to stay home and rest after the birth of her first 
child three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearlihy, in her ninth season with the Indians, had a Cesarean section, giving 
birth to a son, Joshua, on Dec. 15. The next week, she was back on the court, 
directing Alemany to the championship of the Simi Valley tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely felt a little tired coming back so quick," said Hearlihy, whose 
team is 11-0. "But I couldn't stand not to be on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany did not play in a tournament last week, giving its coach a much-needed 
rest. Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Cerritos Gahr girls' basketball team will have to forfeit its 10 victories 
for using an ineligible player. Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner, 
said the player in question is a junior transfer student, who started every 
game last month. . . . The North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake boys' team is off 
to its best start at 12-0. It upset Glendora for the championship of the Covina 
tournament last Thursday. The Wolverines are led by freshmen Jason and Jarron 
Collins, identical twins. Jason, a 6-8 center, is averaging 17 points, 11 
rebounds and three blocked shots and was the MVP of the Covina tournament. 
Jarron, a 6-7 forward, is averaging nine points, seven rebounds and two blocked 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Roosevelt girls' team withdrew from the L.A. Invitational last week 
because its coach protested a late scheduling change. After the Roughriders had 
defeated Dorsey in the quarterfinals, they were supposed to play Santa Monica 
Crossroads in the semifinals. But Jerry Weiner, the tournament director, said 
he had made a mistake on the bracket and told Coach Lorenzo Garcia that 
Roosevelt would instead play top-seeded Lynwood in the semifinals. Upset over 
the last-minute change, Garcia pulled his team. . . . Brea-Olinda solidified 
its position as the No. 1 girls' basketball team in the Southland by defeating 
Lake Oswego Lakeridge of Oregon in the championship game of the Alaska 
Invitational in Anchorage last Thursday, 63-54.

UC IRVINE OPENS BIG LEAD, HOLDS OFF CS FULLERTON, 77-71 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine opened a 27-7 lead and then barely held on to beat Cal State 
Fullerton, 77-71, in the Big West Conference opener for both teams before 973 
in Titan Gym on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Brown led the Anteaters (4-4) with 15 points and Lloyd Mumford added 
14.Winston Peterson led Fullerton (2-7) with 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Monday, the closest eight of Fullerton's nine players had gotten to the 
Big West Conference was when Holland talked about it during practice. And in 
the first few minutes against Irvine, it looked as if maybe these new Titans 
had wandered into the wrong conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters scored the first 10 points and had their 20-point lead with 9:11 
to play in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans didn't score a point for the first four minutes and only managed 
two in the first six. They committed 12 turnovers, and many of them were 
unforced. There was Darren Little, dribbling off of his foot out of bounds. 
There was Greg Vernon, driving the lane, going into the air, and firing a 
fastball out of bounds. There was James French, stepping into the lane, passing 
up an open six-footer and passing out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, meanwhile, was scoring nearly at will, with Jermaine Avie getting 10 
points. But Fullerton eventually pulled itself together. Guard Chris St. Clair 
pulled down four rebounds and forward freshman Josh King made three consecutive 
three-pointers around the five-minute mark. He nearly matched his career-high 
of 10 points during the 1:44 span. Vernon added another three-pointer and the 
margin eventually shrank to 34-28. It was 40-30 at halftime.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; MICHIGAN'S NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION: SHOOT STRAIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two extra hours of shooting practice was the right prescription for Michigan's 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy King scored 12 of his 18 points in the first half and helped the 
13th-ranked Wolverines shake off their holiday blues Monday night with a 111-84 
victory over Boston University at Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan led at halftime, 53-31, and by as many as 37 points thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We passed the ball really well tonight," King said. "We had a lot of assists 
(27). The good passes led to open shots, and we hit the shots." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines (8-2) were coming off their worst loss of the season, a 119-95 
thrashing by Arizona in the championship game of the Fiesta Bowl Classic last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jalen Rose and Juwan Howard each had 19 points for Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunji Awojobi scored 18 points for the Terriers (5-4). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 Arkansas 96, Southern Methodist 70 -- Roger Crawford started and ended a 
17-2 second-half run and Al Dillard scored 18 points in the second half for the 
top-ranked Razorbacks (9-0) at Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 SMU (2-7) had 30 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bonaventure 71, No. 23 George Washington 67 -- Omo Moses disregarded the 
set play that Coach Mike Jarvis had called with 15 seconds to play and drove 
for the basket, only to be met by a bunch of Bonnies. 
</P>
<P>
 Moses' shot never got near the rim and St. Bonaventure (4-5, 1-2) held on to 
beat the Colonials (6-3, 0-1) in the Atlantic 10 Conference game at Olean, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 19 Minnesota 89, Northeastern Illinois 62 -- Voshon Lenard scored 17 
points to lead the Gophers at Minneapolis. Minnesota (9-3) built a 45-19 
halftime lead when Northeastern Illinois (6-6) made only six of 30 shots. OTHER 
GAMES Fred Ferguson had 15 points and 12 rebounds in leading Washington State 
(10-2) to an 86-63 victory over Alaska Anchorage (9-5) at Pullman, Wash. . . . 
Paul Jarrett scored seven points in a second-half spurt, leading New Mexico 
State (8-1) to a 92-71 victory over UC Santa Barbara (4-7) at Las Cruces, N.M., 
in a Big West Conference opener. . . . Kenya Wilkins and Henry Madden had 17 
points each to lead Oregon (4-5) in a 100-71 victory over Alaska Fairbanks 
(7-7) at Eugene, Ore.

LOYOLA LOSES IN OVERTIME, 92-91 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Loyola Marymount's inability to rebound in key situations has hurt the Lions 
on numerous occasions in the past two seasons, but never more than Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfield forward Shannon Bowman grabbed an offensive rebound and made a short 
jump shot with three seconds left in overtime to give the Stags a 92-91 victory 
at Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 It was perhaps the most bitter defeat in Loyola's 19-game losing streak. The 
Lions (0-9) blew an 83-78 lead in the final 33 seconds of regulation, then 
failed to box out on the defensive end after Bill Mazurie had given the Lions a 
91-90 lead on two free throws with 16 seconds left in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 After Fairfield (3-4) brought the ball up court, guard Craig Martin drove the 
baseline and put up a driving shot that hit the front of the rim, bounced over 
the basket and into the hands of Bowman, who put the ball back in. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyking Jones led Loyola with 19 points. Mazurie, who scored all seven of the 
Lions' points in overtime, scored 12, as did freshman forward Mike O'Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfield's Martin led all scorers with 26 points, including five three-point 
shots. ROB FERNAS

CRITICS GIVE SPIELBERG A DAY IN THE SUN FOR 'LIST'; AWARDS: HE'S HONORED AS 
BEST DIRECTOR BY THE NATIONAL SOCIETY OF FILM CRITICS FOR HIS HOLOCAUST DRAMA, 
WHICH ALSO TAKES THE BEST PICTURE CROWN. 
</P>

 Steven Spielberg's directing efforts -- until now largely overlooked by film 
reviewer groups -- were finally honored by the National Society of Film Critics 
on Monday, as the group voted to name him best director of 1993 and his film 
"Schindler's List" the best movie of year. 
</P>
<P>
 The win gives Spielberg's Holocaust drama a sweep in the Triple Crown of 
critics' year-end voting, and marks only the second occasion in recent movie 
history that the nation's preeminent critics' groups have agreed on the year's 
best film. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the Los Angeles Film Critics' Assn. and the New York Film 
Critics' Circle both picked "Schindler's List" as the choice for best film of 
the year, but overlooked Spielberg for director. The only time all three groups 
agreed was in 1990 when they selected Martin Scorsese's "GoodFellas." The only 
other time that the Los Angeles and New York film critics agreed was in 1986 
when both picked Woody Allen's "Hannah and Her Sisters." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's triple win by "Schindler's List," plus the movie's six nominations 
for Golden Globes, which will be awarded Jan. 22, put it in a strong position 
for the upcoming Oscar race. The winners of the critics' voting can be 
indicators for the Oscar races. But when all three groups agree, there is no 
real precedent. "GoodFellas" was nominated for best picture Oscar, but was 
beaten out for best picture by "Dances With Wolves." 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the National Society of Film Critics, voted in New York at the 
Algonquin Hotel, most notably differed from the two other groups in the choice 
of director. The others had voted the honor to New Zealand director Jane 
Campion for her romantic drama "The Piano." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, all three groups gave the best actress prize to Holly 
Hunter for her non-speaking role as a Scottish woman finding love outside a 
prearranged marriage in 19th-Century New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 The best actor prize went to David Thewlis in "Naked," for his role as an 
alienated, loquacious young man who is adrift in London. The winners and 
runners-up: 
</P>
<P>
 Picture: "Schindler's List." Runner-up: "The Piano." 
</P>
<P>
 Director: Steven Spielberg, "Schindler's List." Runner-up: Jane Campion, "The 
Piano." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor: David Thewlis, "Naked." Runner-up: Anthony Hopkins, "Shadowlands," 
"Remains of the Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting actor: Ralph Fiennes, "Schindler's List." Runners-up: (tie) Tommy 
Lee Jones, "The Fugitive"; Leonardo DiCaprio, "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" and 
"This Boy's Life." 
</P>
<P>
 Actress: Holly Hunter, "The Piano." Runner-up: Ashley Judd, "Ruby in 
Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting actress: Madeleine Stowe, "Short Cuts." Runner-up: Gwyneth Paltrow, 
"Flesh and Bone." 
</P>

THE LION WILL ROAR AT LACMA; MOVIES: MARKING MGM'S 70TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR, A 
PRIME BATCH OF THE STUDIO'S FILMS WILL SCREEN IN A TWO-MONTH, 40-FILM TRIBUTE 
STARTING FRIDAY. 
</P>

 Like the remains of some dethroned colossus, the disparate components of 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, once the studio of studios, lie scattered and apart, an 
almost biblical rebuke to the hubris of those who felt they had created an 
invincible movie-making machine that could last forever. 
</P>
<P>
 The fabled MGM lot in Culver City, which once spread over 275 acres and 
boasted a lake, a jungle and its own post office, is now reduced in size and in 
the hands of the Sony Corp., which is carefully restoring it to previous 
splendor. 
</P>
<P>
 The movies MGM made in its glory days, well over a thousand all told, are now 
owned by the Atlanta-based Turner Entertainment Co., which is about to put them 
into service as the centerpiece of a new, commercial-free movie channel to be 
called TCM (for Turner Classic Movies, of course) and set to begin broadcasting 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And, after depressing years in an office building just across the street from 
its old home, the movie-making part of MGM has relocated in a development in 
Santa Monica and is trying hard -- witness its current "Six Degrees of 
Separation" -- to claim a spot as a studio to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who long for the old days, when the studio's credo was "Make it good 
. . . make it big . . . give it class," there is a temporary reprieve. Starting 
Friday (and marking the studio's 70th anniversary year), the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art is hosting a two-month, 40-film tribute, complete with star 
appearances, to the entire span of MGM, from early silents like 1924's "He Who 
Gets Slapped" to its more recent triumphs like "Moonstruck" and "Thelma & 
Louise." 
</P>
<P>
 In an age when, unlike today, studios were not owned by diversified 
conglomerates and so had the opportunity to develop distinctive personalities, 
several things marked MGM and made it stand out from the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 First was the studio's insistence on quality. From top people like art 
director Cedric Gibbons and costumer Adrian down to the merest grip, MGM's 
employees believed in making the glossiest, most glamorous films possible, and 
often stayed around for decades in order to make that happen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And what better to achieve glamour than stars? Other studios might have the 
better directors or sharper writers, but not for nothing was MGM's motto "More 
Stars Than There Are in Heaven." The studio scoured the Earth for likely 
performers, and when if it felt the potential was there, as it it did with a 
beautiful but untutored 18-year-old Ava Gardner, it did not hesitate to bring a 
neophyte out to the studio for a complete and total make-over, including voice, 
posture, dress and deportment. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseeing all this was the man without whom MGM would have been a very 
different place, Louis B. Mayer, who ran the studio like a 
benevolent/authoritarian father with a large and unruly family. Working out of 
an office so sizable that fellow mogul Samuel Goldwyn claimed "you need an 
automobile just to reach your desk," Mayer often out-acted his stars as he 
threatened or cajoled them into doing things his way. A major league 
sentimentalist who claimed to worship women, especially mothers, his fondness 
for make-believe emotions and real tears marked MGM's product as surely as the 
roar of Leo the Lion that proceeded each film. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's selection from MGM's vast output has, of course, its share of 
familiar classics that are always welcome on the big screen, from star vehicles 
like "The Philadelphia Story," "Mrs. Miniver" and "Dinner at Eight" to familiar 
and deservedly loved musicals like "Singin' in the Rain" and "The Wizard of 
Oz." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is also showing once-celebrated films not often thought of anymore. 
For instance, the severely truncated (by head of production Irving Thalberg) 
version of Erich Von Stroheim's would-be masterpiece "Greed," accompanied, as 
are all the silent films, by the excellent Robert Israel at the organ. Or the 
wildly popular weepy "Random Harvest," a preposterous but irresistible tale of 
love and amnesia featuring classy performances by Greer Garson and Ronald 
Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, the series offers a chance for more in-depth looks at three areas 
the studio had something of a reputation in, starting with that most MGM of 
genres, the musical. The most celebrated were made by the Arthur Freed Unit, 
and the museum is screening some of these as well as some non-Freed 
extravaganzas. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Harvey Girls": Though she overmatches her nominal romantic co-star, John 
Hodiak, Judy Garland is expressive as always in this George Sidney-directed 
extravaganza about restaurant chain waitresses who helped conquer the West 
"with a beefsteak and a cup of coffee." Also memorable in this beautiful new 
print are Angela Lansbury as a bar-hall soprano with a permanent smirk, the 
tap-dancing of Ray Bolger, and the classic showstopper, "On the Atchison, 
Topeka and the Santa Fe," which took 20 days to rehearse and eight hours to 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lili": Any musical in which Zsa Zsa Gabor gives one of the stronger 
performances has got to be unusual, but the truth is that with one exception 
all the acting in this film is undistinguished. That exception is the luminous 
Leslie Caron, whose enchanting performance as an innocent young waif who 
communicates with marionettes helped, along with the lilting "Hi-Lili-Hi-Lo," 
to make this a perennial audience favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers": If the musical is one of the most American 
of genres, this has got to be one of the most American of musicals. Set in the 
Oregon Territory in 1850 and starring Jane Powell as the intrepid woman who 
impulsively marries Howard Keel only to find he lives with six unruly brothers, 
this film is known for its revolutionary Michael Kidd choreography. Brawny and 
athletic, "Brothers" featured dances that are half brawls and brawls that are 
half dances. It's as energetic and lively a musical as any studio ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 Although MGM isn't always remembered for its horror films, it made more than 
its share, some of which are featured in a five-film Horror Movie Marathon. 
Perhaps the most unusual of these is "Mad Love," an atmospheric curio starring 
Peter Lorre as a brilliant but obsessed surgeon who grafts a killer's hands 
onto a concert pianist and lives to regret it. Aside from hearing Lorre say 
lines like "I, a poor peasant, have conquered science; why can't I conquer 
love?" the main interest this uneven film provides is its Expressionistic look 
and the work of Gregg Toland. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM was also the home of perhaps the most unsettling actors Hollywood ever 
produced, Lon Chaney, and this series features three of his films, starting 
with "He Who Gets Slapped" and ending with Chaney's only talkie, a remake of 
his earlier success, "The Unholy Three," which was released only seven weeks 
before the actor's untimely death at age 47. 
</P>
<P>
 With his expressive eyes and a mobile face, Chaney's greatest 
characterizations mixed pathos with malignancy to extraordinary effect. "The 
Unknown," directed by longtime collaborator Tod Browning in 1927, is vintage 
Chaney. He plays Alonzo the Armless, a traveling performer who competes with 
the circus strongman for the affection of the sloe-eyed Nanon (an early role 
for Joan Crawford). Chaney used a double for some of the armless situations, 
but the formidable and unsettling presence he brought to the role is his alone. 
</P>
<P>
 More characteristic of the studio, and also represented by a marathon, are 
family films, the warm-hearted sentimental stuff that L.B. loved so well. In 
addition to "Captains Courageous" and a pair of Garland/Mickey Rooney 
programmers (including "Love Finds Andy Hardy," one of 16 Hardy films the 
studio turned out), the museum is showing one of the best-loved kids movies 
ever made, "Lassie Come Home." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a fascinating book on the Lassie phenomenon by Ace Collins, MGM 
auditioned no fewer than 1,500 dogs when it decided to film the popular Eric 
Knight novel. Pal, the male dog who ended up playing Lassie on film, was 
originally hired as a stand-in, but when the nominal star refused to do a 
demanding sequence, Pal (quite literally) jumped in, and the rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
 Finely assisted by Roddy McDowall and an 11-year-old Elizabeth Taylor in her 
first MGM role, "Lassie Come Home" earned $3 million in its opening weekend, a 
phenomenal figure for 1943. As this entertaining series constantly reminds us, 
making family fare with integrity as well as emotion has become as much of a 
lost art as all the other things MGM did so well, things that no one else seems 
to do at all these days. The Dates and Times

L.A.'S SUCCESSFULLY SERIOUS ART MAGAZINE TURNING 5; PUBLISHING: EDITOR GARY 
KORNBLAU'S BIMONTHLY, ART ISSUES., SURVIVES DESPITE THE VOLATILITY OF THE ART 
AUDIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Gary Kornblau admits it. He's off-kilter, and so is his magazine, Art issues. 
A book-and-movie devotee who doesn't even like magazines, Kornblau started his 
publishing venture five years ago for two reasons: to avoid writing his 
dissertation on 17th-Century French philosopher Rene Descartes and to have 
something to read. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always interested in visual culture. It was just something I liked to 
do, but there wasn't anything (in the field) I liked to read," says the 
32-year-old editor, who holds forth in a tiny office adjacent to his hillside 
house near Hollywood Bowl. "I wanted to read interesting and coherent writing 
about issues of art, so I scrounged together enough money for one issue -- 
about $30,000 in start-up costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicious of art magazines that he believes are driven by theory or commerce, 
and intrigued by a wider range of subjects than those publications cover, he 
set out to create something entirely different: a forum for serious but 
readable discussion on the relationships between popular culture and fine art. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea if it would fly," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kornblau wasn't the only one who had doubts. New York-based critic Peter 
Schjeldahl recalls "laughing in Gary's face" when Kornblau spoke of his plans 
and solicited contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was crazy," Schjeldahl says. "I thought it would be a silly 
vanity magazine." But Schjeldahl, who has cheerfully eaten crow and even 
contributed to a recent issue, now praises the magazine's "great pitch of 
seriousness and insouciance." 
</P>
<P>
 Being off-kilter by art-world standards seems to be Kornblau's secret to 
success. Art issues. is celebrating its fifth birthday in a city that is not 
known for supporting art publishing -- and in an economic climate that has 
killed several magazines, closed dozens of galleries and reduced the operations 
of major museums all across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Kornblau's publication is receiving critical accolades. Most 
impressive is that Art issues. Press' first book, "The Invisible Dragon," a 
collection of four essays on beauty by Dave Hickey, has won the College Art 
Assn.'s 1994 Frank Jewett Mather Award. The award, granted each year for 
distinction in art criticism, will be presented on Feb. 18 at CAA's annual 
meeting in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The recognition is gratifying, in part because the prize is a symbolic vote of 
confidence in a projected series to be published in lieu of the magazine's 
summer issues. And although the Hickey book is a small paperback, its very 
existence and relative permanence gives the magazine "more of a life," Kornblau 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking about the development of his vision, Kornblau makes quick work of his 
life before Art issues. For the record, he grew up in Pasadena, studied 
philosophy at UC Berkeley and Columbia University, and returned to Los Angeles 
to write his dissertation on Descartes' theory of knowledge, which he calls 
"pretty dry, analytical stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he started a magazine that prints everything from heretical views of 
Disney fantasies to reviews of exhibitions in Los Angeles galleries. A essay by 
Hickey on the Liberace Museum in Las Vegas was featured in what Kornblau calls 
his "most famous issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Other numbers have carried such offbeat fare as a treatise on hair by David 
Humphrey and an essay on collecting baseball cards by Colin Gardner. In the 
current "fifth anniversary" issue, Bernard Welt's "Mythomania" column addresses 
"St. Dorothy of Oz," while Libby Lumpkin's "A History of the Smile" traces the 
subject of upturned mouths from archaic Greek statues and Leonardo's "Mona 
Lisa" to smiley face buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We treat all different aspects of culture, but in the context of the art 
world," Kornblau says. "I don't have a theoretical or political ax to grind. I 
let art and culture dictate subjects. The idea is to look at things 
intelligently and turn them upside down."  
</P>
<P>
 Although the magazine has evolved over five years, it has always focused on 
relationships between art and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about treating popular art as distinct from high art -- or saying 
that the two come together -- but treating entertainment seriously and treating 
art seriously," Kornblau says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fundamentally, however, the point is not to "teach or inform through art, but 
to live through art," he says. "I'm not interested in art that critiques 
culture or informs people, or in art that is didactic, cynical or ironic, but 
in art that lives with people." 
</P>
<P>
 He founded the magazine in 1988 with designer Linda Norlen, who came up with a 
scheme for a black-and-white-plus-one-color format that sets Art issues. apart 
from the usual throwaways and full-color glossies. Her ongoing contributions as 
the magazine's designer are essential to its survival, according to Kornblau. 
</P>
<P>
 But Art issues. is "Gary's show," as Hickey puts it. He's talking about a 
one-man operation in which Kornblau functions as editor, secretary, ad 
salesman, fund-raiser and strategist. Having sunk a total of $50,000 into the 
enterprise, Kornblau ran out of money in 1991 and decided the solution was to 
apply for nonprofit status. It was granted the following year when the 
Foundation for Advanced Critical Studies, a nonprofit, public-benefit 
corporation, became publisher of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magazine isn't mine anymore. I only run it," Kornblau says. About 70% of 
the budget is funded through contributions, including grants from the Lannan 
Foundation, the Peter Norton Family Foundation, the Andy Warhol Foundation for 
the Visual Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, the California Arts 
Council and the City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department. The remaining 
30% comes from advertising. Kornblau raised $14,000 during the first year of 
the magazine's nonprofit existence and $20,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kornblau says he spends too much time on fund-raising and hates every minute 
of it. To make matters worse, he doesn't believe in nonprofit status. "I think 
that if there isn't enough money to keep something alive, there's no reason for 
it to exist," he says, "but here I am running a nonprofit. This is the only way 
that this kind of thing can exist." 
</P>
<P>
 The bimonthly magazine reaches about 9,000 people in the course of a year, he 
says. In addition to 2,000 paid subscriptions (at $35 a year), free copies are 
mailed to artists, writers, libraries and art schools. About 60% of the 
circulation is in California, 30% is in New York and the remainder is scattered 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he claims emotional and financial support from New York, Kornblau 
believes Los Angeles is where it's at, culturally speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art issues. is an American magazine about American culture," he says. 
"Everything is being Americanized. European art is interesting to the extent 
that it is dealing with American art, and American art is interesting to the 
extent that it is dealing with Los Angeles . . . I think we should be 
provincial as hell. Who cares? We've got it all." 
</P>
<P>
 While depending upon such well-known figures as Hickey to get the unorthodox 
word out, Kornblau makes a practice of working with young, inexperienced 
writers. Indeed, he says, "What I feel most proud of is giving voices a forum 
from which they can develop." The magazine currently has about 30 writers, 15 
of whom are regular contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 The writers are encouraged to pursue their own interests, but Art issues. is 
not a democratic operation. "It's about developing taste," Kornblau says. 
"Writers develop more thoughtful taste in the process of writing, and then they 
have something to say . . . One of the most sophisticated relations one can 
have with art is sitting down and writing about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But success -- no matter how modest or hard won -- creates a sense of duty.

ABC'S WONG FINDS HERSELF IN ASIA JOB ; TELEVISION: THE BEIJING REPORTER'S 
MEETING WITH HER GRANDMOTHER IN RURAL CHINA LAUNCHED A SEARCH FOR ROOTS AND A 
CAREER AS WELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Deborah Wong, ABC-TV's Beijing correspondent, was 18 when she first met her 
paternal grandmother. That was in 1980, in the rural reaches of China's 
Shandong Province. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong credits that strange first meeting with launching her search for her 
Chinese roots and eventually her entry into journalism in Asia, where she has 
become one of the network's emerging overseas stars. 
</P>
<P>
 At their first meeting, the grandmother, only 4-feet-11 and illiterate, and 
the granddaughter, a lanky 5-foot-8 American raised in the Chicago suburbs, 
stared at each other with mutual bewilderment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd look at each other and both of us realized the huge gulf there was 
between us. There was absolutely nothing I had in common with this woman," 
recalled Wong. 
</P>
<P>
 The grandmother, her feet bound in the ancient, now outlawed, practice, had 
never ridden in an automobile until Wong and her father took her with them to 
the United States to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in bed together back in Chicago, the two women compared feet. The feet 
became a metaphor for the gap between them, physically and culturally. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would stick her feet out -- these tiny little feet -- and I have huge 
feet. We'd put them next to each other and compare them. Suddenly, after 
generations of bound feet, my feet were just springing forward in liberation. 
She would laugh at how big mine were, and I would laugh at how small hers 
were." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiosity about her grandmother, her life and her land, drew Wong back to 
China. Wong began studying Chinese her sophomore year at Wesleyan College. Her 
junior year in a Duke University program took her to Nanjing for four months 
and Beijing for two. Then she went on her own to teach English in Hangzhou for 
the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong, who was born in 1962 in East Chicago, Ind., says that as a teen-ager, 
she never felt completely American and she dreamed that going to China would be 
like going home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided that the way to 'pass' (as a native) was to wear white cotton 
shirts and blue cotton pants and little green army sneakers and put my hair in 
a braid." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the early '80s, the beginning of China's reform period, the Chinese had 
just shed their uniform of dull gray, green and blue Mao suits. Women in cities 
were eagerly experimenting with fashion and makeup; they were wearing platform 
shoes, polyester and permed hair. So, people noticed immediately that Wong, 
dressed as a Chinese peasant girl, was in a costume. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong says she learned a painful lesson on that trip -- that the part of 
herself that she was searching for was not in China. She learned that she, as a 
Chinese American, was considered an outsider and that outsiders are never 
really accepted in Chinese culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, she began working for WGBH, the Boston public television station, as 
a correspondent and a fill-in anchor woman. After a year, she was offered the 
job of National Public Radio's correspondent in Hong Kong. Wong's father, who 
had escaped with her mother from Mainland China in 1949, was not pleased to 
learn that she was moving to Asia. She said he told her: "I've spent all of my 
life trying to get out of that hell hole, out of the village to the U.S., where 
I've made a good life for you children. Why would you want to go back there?" 
</P>
<P>
 So it took him a while to get used to the idea, but Wong says he is now very 
supportive of her work. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wong was in Hong Kong, covering Southeast Asia, Central Asia and the 
Middle East for National Public Radio, Peter Jennings of ABC News became one of 
her biggest fans. Jennings decided to recruit Wong to strengthen ABC's Asia 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went after her, and we were lucky to get her," Jennings said. "She is 
marvelously intelligent. She adapted to television very quickly, much more 
readily than most print or even radio reporters. Everything we've asked her to 
do -- whether it's in Asia, where she is very comfortable, or elsewhere -- 
she's done with depth and sensitivity." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong understands the difficulties of working as a correspondent in Communist 
China, where there is always suspicion and fear of journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She knows that as a TV journalist, she can never completely blend in. No 
longer trying to imitate a Chinese peasant girl, Wong looks the complete 
professional. On camera, she wears makeup, but otherwise she often wears none. 
She is garrulous and her style is unembarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wong says that she wants to have a good time while she is in China 
working as ABC's Beijing correspondent, she also has some serious goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really want to work on my Chinese, do some stories that I'm proud of, see a 
bit more of the country and get to know the Chinese as well as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Where will Wong go next? "I think at some point you have to go home, and I 
love the United States. I love the open space, the clean air, I love the beach. 
I love Americans. I want to go home at some point."

O.C. ART / CATHY CURTIS; PUTTING ACCENT ON VARIETY, MUSEUMS FACE '90S ISSUES; A 
LOOK AHEAD: THIS YEAR'S EXHIBITION SOUND TANTALIZINGLY DIVERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It might be a figment of my flu-fevered brain, but it's almost as though 
Orange County's art institutions conspired to mount a wide range of exhibitions 
that give most every special-interest group something it wants this year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, we're still living in the twilight zone of last year's museum 
schedule because of programming vagaries and the longer-lasting new breed of 
exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you hang around for the new-in-'94 schedule, you'll find an unusual 
number of shows dealing with vital contemporary issues: race, gender, ecology, 
consumerism and changes within ethnic communities. (See "Also of Special 
Interest" and "Promoting Differences" below.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these shows are highly intellectualized. Others are obviously meant to 
appeal to a broad audience. Some may turn out to be overly didactic. Others 
will likely offer fresh insights and memorable imagery. But it seems clear that 
these -- far more than purely aesthetic themes -- are the art issues of the 
'90s, the stuff artists and the rest of us are most engaged with on a 
day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
 For viewers who do yearn for lovely objects, Newport Harbor Art Museum has a 
large craft show on tap. Those who prefer to revisit the past can choose 
between the familiar landscapes of the plein-air set and the more exotic, 
abstracted world of Augustus Vincent Tack. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of full-scale historical surveys, however, will notice such shows are 
rarer than ever, perhaps a recessionary sign. Only the Bowers Museum of 
Cultural Art's import of an exhibition on ancient Nubia really fits the bill 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But we are getting a long-awaited retrospective of seminal modernist painter 
John McLaughlin, at the Laguna Art Museum, whose exhibition roster admirably 
balances diverse interests and provides the largest single concentration of 
strong-sounding shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet solo shows of contemporary artists also seem to be on the decline for some 
reason. So far, the only two I've heard about are Tony DeLap's at Cal State 
Fullerton in February and Tim Hawkinson's at Chapman University in March. 
</P>
<P>
 When Newport Harbor Art Museum releases its full 1994 schedule (it doesn't 
officially commit itself to shows these days until it has funding for them), 
there will be more to report. Other venues will be filling up their schedules, 
too. But even with this partial outlook, the pickings don't seem too lean. Hey, 
this may even be a terrific year in art. Watch this space for the play-by-play. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Bet "John McLaughlin: A Retrospective" (Laguna Art Museum, Oct. 14-Jan. 
15, 1995). About 60 paintings by the first major postwar modern artist to 
emerge in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after he moved to Dana Point in 1946, he developed a rigorous 
geometric style based in part on the theoretical views of Russian Suprematist 
artist Kasimir Malevich and in part on the Eastern concept of "the void." By 
the mid-'50s, he had eliminated volume, shading and texture from his paintings, 
leaving only exquisitely calibrated flat rectangular shapes. Curated by Charles 
Desmarais, director of the Laguna Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Also of Special Interest "Partial Recall: Photographs of Native North 
Americans" (UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery, Jan. 11-Feb. 12). How have traditional 
photographs of Native Americans shaped our conception of who they are? 
Reproductions of such images were presented to several Native American writers, 
artists and activists as points of departure for essays. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group of photographs were taken by contemporary artists specifically 
to challenge the biases of the older images. Organized by the Tyler Galleries 
of the Tyler School of Art, Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony DeLap -- The House of the Magician: An Installation of Reconstructed 
Works, 1967-1975" (Cal State Fullerton, Main Art Gallery, Feb. 5-March 13). 
Works from a key period of the dean of Orange County's contemporary artists, a 
longtime fixture of the UC Irvine art department, with a smaller show of his 
drawings and prints in the East Gallery (Feb. 5-25). 
</P>
<P>
 "Grammarians" (Guggenheim Gallery, Chapman University, Feb. 7-March 11). 
Artist and art critic Michael Anderson has assembled work by nine Los Angeles 
and New York artists whose writing -- fiction, poetry, plays or art criticism 
-- is integral to their art-making. Featured are Kenneth Goldsmith, Benjamin 
Weismann, Gabrielle Jennings, Tyler Stallings, Lisa Auerbach, Frances Stark, 
Alexis Hall, Raymond Pettibon and the late Guy de Cointet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim Hawkinson" (Guggenheim Gallery, Chapman University, March 21-April 29). A 
solo show of work by the young Los Angeles artist whose extraordinarily 
original work has a nutty logic of its own is always a happily awaited event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Commodity Image: Photography, Sculpture, Installation" (Laguna Art Museum, 
May 13-July 24). Photographs by contemporary artists, social documentarians and 
commercial photographers record and comment on aesthetics, fashion, celebrity, 
commerce and money in our consumer society. 
</P>
<P>
 With work by Lee Friedlander, Mitchell Syrop, Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger, 
Louise Lawler and many more. Organized by the International Center for 
Photography, New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fragile Ecologies: Artists' Interpretations and Solutions" (Laguna Art 
Museum, July 29-Oct. 9). Drawings, models, photographs, videos and multimedia 
installations of public projects by 12 artists collaborating with community 
groups, engineers, architects and scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The projects, which date from the late 1960s to 1990, range from a proposal 
for reclaiming a garbage landfill to systematized replanting of native 
vegetation in urban areas. Artists include Alan Sonfist, Newton and Helen Mayer 
Harrison, Mel Chin, Buster Simpson and Patricia Johanson. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoting Differences "Baking Cookies" (Orange County Center for Contemporary 
Art, Jan. 5-Feb. 4). Feminist-themed work by 26 Southern Californian artists, 
members of the Orange County Satellite of the Southern California Women's 
Caucus for Art. 
</P>
<P>
 "Erika Rothenberg: House of Cards" (Laguna Art Museum, April 1-July 10). 
Rothenberg's satirical greeting cards invert the usual Hallmark pieties by 
addressing embarrassing situations, unspoken prejudices, political issues and 
personal conflicts. Organized by the Museum of Modern Art, New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "A New Generation: Vietnamese-American Contemporary Art" (Cal State Fullerton, 
Main Art Gallery, April 10-May 15). Work by nine artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outside/In" (Fullerton Museum Center, April 22-June 5). Paintings, drawings, 
prints and ceramics from artists with developmental disabilities, many of whom 
are part of the First Street Gallery and Art Center in Fullerton, co-organizers 
of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Celebrating the Life Cycle: Rites of Passage in America" (Fullerton Museum 
Center, June 24-Aug. 14). Photographs and artifacts examine how Americans from 
18 ethnic backgrounds celebrate the "big four": birth, coming of age, marriage

 A major theme: How ethnic traditions have been lost or changed during the past 
century. Organized by the Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies, Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lighter Side: Hats, Crafts and Baseball "Contemporary Crafts and the Saxe 
Collection" (Newport Harbor Art Museum, March 12-June 5). Organized by the

artists -- one-quarter of whom are Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haute Hats" (Fullerton Museum Center, April 26-June 26). The history of 
millinery, illustrated with historical hats and contemporary artists' hats that 
illustrate the utilitarian and creative aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Major League/Minor League: Photographs of America's Baseball Stadiums by Jim 
Dow" (Fullerton Museum Center, Sept. 24-Nov. 13). Forty panoramic views,

<P>
 "Augustus Vincent Tack: Landscape of the Spirit" (Laguna Art Museum, Feb. 
25-May 8). The first retrospective of the American visionary painter. During 
his lifetime (1870-1949), Tack was known for landscapes, portraits and mural 
commissions inspired by the Tonalists, the Arts and Crafts movement and the 
Japanese-influenced aesthetic of John La Farge. In the early '20s, his 
increasing spiritualism merged with a style of thin washes of color forming 
abstract patterns. From the Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>

compilation to date of paintings by William J. McCloskey (1859-1941) and his

KTLA WEARS THE CROWN FOR ROSE PARADE VIEWERS; TELEVISION: CHANNEL 5 EARNS A 
24.1 RATING, EASILY BEATING CHANNEL 11'S SECOND-PLACE FINISH OF 8.7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 KTLA-TV Channel 5's coverage of Saturday's Tournament of Roses Parade had its 
greatest dominance over the Los Angeles television market in at least a decade, 
according to figures released Monday by the A. C. Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-three percent of the television audience tuned to the Tribune 
Broadcasting-owned independent to see the 105th edition of Pasadena's floral 
spectacular.Station officials said that was the highest audience share in the 
11 years for which it has comparable figures. 
</P>
<P>
 KTLA's 24.1 rating was three-tenths of a point higher than last year, as it 
easily won the Tournament of Roses Parade ratings race for the 19th consecutive 
year, attracting 53.5% more viewers than the four other English-language 
stations carrying the parade. With each rating point in the five-county Los 
Angeles market being equivalent to 50,064 households, that means about 1.2 
million households were tuned to KTLA for the day's highest-rated program. 
</P>
<P>
 KTTV-TV Channel 11, which has tried a number of approaches to try to blunt 
KTLA's dominance, was second with an 8.7 rating, two-tenths of a point better 
than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The three major network owned-and-operated stations, which unlike KTLA and 
KTTV leave the parade for commercials, continued their tradition of lagging far 
behind the commercial-free, locally produced telecasts in the parade ratings as 
KABC-TV Channel 7 had a 2.6, KNBC-TV Channel 4 a 2.4 and KCBS-TV Channel 2 a 
1.9. 
</P>

A JOURNEY NOT ONLY OF SOUND, BUT OF SIGHT; MUSIC: THE PACIFIC SYMPHONY WILL 
LAUNCH A CONCERT CALLED 'THE PLANETS,' WHICH WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY PHOTOS 
TAKEN VIA SATELLITE.

 If you think the folks at the Pacific Symphony are spacing out, you're right. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the orchestra ended 1993 with a "Voyage to 2001" and starts the new 
year with a concert called "The Planets." And this time out, they're showing 
photos taken from satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea may not be as out there as it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Planets' certainly seems like a natural," said Marc Jacobs, whose 
multimedia interpretation will be featured in tandem with the orchestra's 
performances of Gustav Holst's most popular work Wednesday and Thursday at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are many people who feel that music should stand on its own and 
(that) to try to give it some kind of visual presentation is dictating what the 
audience should imagine. I don't want to say I agree 100% or I'd be out of some 
work!" 
</P>
<P>
 British conductor Christopher Seaman will also lead the orchestra in Berlioz's 
"Roman Carnival" Overture and, with Bion Tsang as cello soloist, Tchaikovsky's 
"Variations on a Rococo Theme." (Bion Tsang replaces Jian Wang, released from 
his contract to pursue a recording project.) Both concerts begin at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal was to take what the music was doing emotionally and to try to 
enhance it," Jacobs, 47, continued. "You put certain images together with 
certain music, you create a certain reaction -- that's what Spielberg does all 
the time. You can take the audience where you want to go, and there's an 
instant emotional response.  
</P>
<P>
 "The music in this case is full of surprises, and I tried to do the same with 
the visuals. I also tried to do something very universal. The thrust of this 
piece is (that) everything affects everything. Holst wrote it after becoming 
interested in astrology, and it was always about how the cosmos affect our 
behavior, not about what's happening on Mars." 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston-born stage director has lived in Los Angeles for 16 years, but, he 
noted, "I rarely work here." He did, however, assist Sir Peter Hall on a Los 
Angeles Music Center Opera production of Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutti," and 
subsequently mounted his own English-language version for the company. He's 
also directed productions for Texas Opera Theatre, Opera Madison (Wis.) and 
Greater Buffalo Opera (N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs' multimedia version of Kurt Weill's "Seven Deadly Sins," originally 
staged in 1988 for the Sacramento Symphony, was performed again last year with 
the Utah Symphony as a 90th birthday tribute to conductor Maurice Abravanel. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Symphony executive director Lou Spisto and music director Carl 
St.Clair had been considering a visual component for "The Planets," and Jacobs 
was recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were thinking of showing slides of planets," Jacobs recalled. "I said, 
'How long can you look at planets?' I came up with a different concept -- the 
planets' effect on man." 
</P>
<P>
 Two 9-by-12-foot screens will float above and to the sides of the orchestra. 
Jeffrey Ault, who assisted Jacobs in Utah, will man the six projectors. Many of 
the 450 photographs were taken from NASA satellites and through powerful 
telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Holst's own movement titles suggest Jacobs' treatments: "Mars, Bringer of 
War," for instance, focuses on man's inhumanity to man; "Venus, Bringer of 
Peace," on love and brotherhood; "Mercury, the Winged Messenger," speed and 
travel; "Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity," humor, and "Saturn, Bringer of Old 
Age," sadness and wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, I use 'Uranus, the Magician' not just to show religious icons, but 
to tie religious symbolism to man's quest in space," Jacobs said. "Man has 
achieved the magic through technology. The last fortissimo burst of music in 
Uranus not only shows the shuttle blasting off but also the astronaut flying 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also originally intended 'Neptune, the Mystic' as a journey through space. 
The music is very spiritual . . . incredibly impressionistic. I had the idea of 
linking a child with the sense of discovery, but I abandoned that. Using space 
as a metaphor for the search of spiritual, the music led me instead to a visual 
search for the eternal feminine." 
</P>
<P>
 Are multimedia presentations a throwback to the Romantic era, when critics and 
performers alike would routinely assign programmatic interpretations to music, 
no matter how absolute? Or is this the shape of things to come? 
</P>
<P>
 Both, said Jacobs: "I was thinking the other day of 'Howards End,' where (the 
characters) go see a concert called 'Music and Meaning,' and some man is 
standing on a platform, telling them about Beethoven's Fifth, saying this is 
where the giants come, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a throwback and it's something going on today. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of the younger audience blasted by MTV and VH-1, they are certainly 
conditioned to get their music with images. More and more symphonies are 
looking for some kind of visual production to bring in an audience that isn't 
necessarily just devoted to classical music." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs insisted that this is very different from, say, Disney's "Fantasia," 
which made classical music more accessible to the masses by assigning animated 
images. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 'Fantasia,' it was clear from the beginning that the emphasis would be 
solely on the visual and the artist's imagination," Jacobs said. "I've got to 
walk a narrower line here. This is as much about Christopher Seaman and what he 
does with this piece. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go to a concert," he continued, "at certain times things affect me 
emotionally, at times I look at what musicians are doing, at other times how 
the composer put together the notes, or what the conductor is doing with his 
body. I hope this doesn't preclude any of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs hopes merely to offer one more option. In so doing, he admitted, "You 
don't want to distract from the music, but at the same time, how can you not?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Guest conductor Christopher Seaman leads the Pacific Symphony in works by 
Holst (with visual adaptation by Marc Jacobs), Tchaikovsky (with cello soloist 
Bion Tsang) and Berlioz on Wednesday and Thursday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Both concerts begin 
at 8 p.m. $14-$39. (714) 740-2000 (Ticketmaster).

IT'S TOUGH TO STAY AFLOAT IN THE FILM-CARTOON BIZ; MOVIES: DISNEY'S HITS PROVE 
THAT IT CAN BE DONE, BUT OTHER FIRMS LACK MARKETING SAVVY AND A COMPETITIVE 
PRODUCT, ANIMATORS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The critical and box-office failure of Steven Spielberg's "We're Back! A 
Dinosaur's Story" and the lackluster performance of Warner Bros.' newly 
released "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm" confirm the unhappy fact that except 
for Disney -- and that's a mighty big exception -- the much-ballyhooed 
renaissance in feature animation has largely proved a bust. 
</P>
<P>
 The successes of "An American Tail" (1986), "Oliver and Company" (1988), "The 
Land Before Time" (1988) and especially "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" (1988) and 
"The Little Mermaid" (1989) made the animated feature a hot property in 
Hollywood. By mid-1990, more feature-length cartoons were in production than at 
any other time in history. 
</P>
<P>
 But 3 1/2 years later, most of those cartoons have come and gone, leaving a 
record that ranges from disappointing to disastrous. In 1992 -- while Disney's 
"Aladdin" earned a record-breaking $215 million -- "Fern Gully: The Last Rain 
Forest" grossed $24.6 million; "Rock-A-Doodle," $11.6 million; "Bebe's Kids," 
$7.5 million; "Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland," $1.4 million; "Freddie 
as F.R.O.7," $1.1 million; and the critically lambasted live-action/animation 
combination "Cool World," $14.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern was repeated in 1993: "We're Back!" has only taken in $7 million 
in five weeks; Hanna-Barbera's "Once Upon a Forest" grossed $6.1 million; "Tom 
and Jerry: The Movie," $2.7 million. "Phantasm" took in a soft $1 million in 
its first week of release during the Christmas holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Disney has been the remarkable exception. Its stop-motion fantasy 
"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas," released by Disney, has taken in 
$48 million and is still in the Top 20 at the box office, and the classic "Snow 
White and the Seven Dwarfs" garnered $41.3 million in a reissue marking the 
65th anniversary of its initial release. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds really arrogant, but the fact is, feature animation hasn't made a 
comeback; Disney animation has made a comeback," said one of the studio's 
animators who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
 The unexpected success of "Snow White" in 1937 established the feature as the 
most prestigious and potentially lucrative area of animation. But the animated 
feature has also been a producer's graveyard since the Fleischer Studio went 
under after the failure of its attempts to rival Disney with "Gulliver's 
Travels" (1939) and "Mr. Bug Goes to Town" (1941). 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Disney dominates the feature market more absolutely than ever.  
</P>
<P>
 In a 1990 interview, David Kirschner, then chairman of Hanna-Barbera, 
expressed concern that an animation renaissance could be endangered by "studios 
saying 'yes' to films that need more work in the development stages before 
they're ready to be shown to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly what happened," he sighs more than three years later. "It was 
evident in the way many of the features looked and were received. Of course, no 
one has a marketing system like Disney's, which is very important. But their 
product was so superior to any of the other films that came out in the last two 
years. Disney seems to understand how to deliver both comedy and pathos better 
than almost anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Segal, president of Universal Cartoon Studio, agrees. "I think the 
problems with the films released in 1992 and 1993 represented a classic case of 
stories not connecting with the market," he says. "The Disney organization has 
mastered the art of producing wonderful pictures, but they also make sure that 
every potential moviegoer knows about their films and are anticipating them 
long before those pictures open. That was decidedly not the case with the other 
animated films released in the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The runaway success of the recent features has spurred an ambitious production 
schedule at Disney. Elton John and Tim Rice are writing the songs for "The Lion 
King," a dramatic coming-of-age story set in the African veldt, scheduled for 
release in June. Also in the works is "The Goofy Movie," featuring Goofy and 
his teen-age son, Max, from the weekday afternoon TV series, due in the fall. 
"Pocahontas," a historical love story with music by Alan Menken and Stephen 
Schwartz, will be out for the holidays in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Disney plans to follow "Nightmare" with another stop-motion film, 
"James and the Giant Peach," and is working with PIXAR, the studio that created 
the Oscar-winning short "Tin Toy," to produce the first computer-animated 
feature. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to make features for a 'cartoon ghetto,' " says Disney feature 
animation president Peter Schneider. "We want them to be accepted as a part of 
mainstream filmmaking, and I feel we've made big strides in that direction: The 
best picture Oscar nomination for 'Beauty and the Beast' honored the art of 
filmmaking as well as the art of animation." 
</P>
<P>
 As the only successful producers of animated features in the country, the 
Disney executives are concerned not to appear to be dancing on others' graves. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our greatest challenges is staying fresh to ourselves," says Tom 
Schumaker, vice president of development. "It's essential that we endeavor not 
to remake our films but make new films with new themes, new approaches, new 
characters. There's no sense of resting on our laurels anywhere in the company 
-- neither in development nor production."  
</P>
<P>
 The challenge of remaining fresh poses different problems for the artists 
themselves: 
</P>
<P>
 "Animation -- even bad animation -- is a lot of work, and if you do that much 
work, you want people to see it, but the reality of the situation is that 
people won't go see it unless it's a Disney film," says the animator who agreed 
to speak anonymously. "Having only one studio in town doing quality animation 
causes problems when we negotiate our contracts, because we have no leverage. 
It's work here or go do 'Ren & Stimpy.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to see another studio score a hit at the box office, 
especially with a breakthrough film in style or subject," he continues. "It 
might convince the people here to do films with even more varied styles and 
subjects than they're doing currently."  
</P>
<P>
 A good animated feature can generate more revenue through video sales and 
licensing than through box-office returns. "Beauty and the Beast" became the 
best-selling video of all time with 20 million units (Disney is estimated to 
have reaped $200 million in profits from U.S. sales of the "Beauty" video 
alone) -- only to have its record broken by "Aladdin" with more than 21 million 
units.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to cassette sales of more than 10 million units, "The Little 
Mermaid" has been adapted to a Saturday morning television show and a series of 
compact discs. Ariel is now the second most licensed figure in the Disney 
stable: Only Mickey Mouse appears on more products. 
</P>
<P>
 With potential stakes this high, it's not surprising that the industry is 
regrouping and gearing up to maintain an increased level of production. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Rock-A-Doodle" sank at the box office, Don Bluth's Dublin-based studio 
was forced into liquidation in October, 1992. Media Assets, a Hong Kong-based 
conglomerate, purchased the studio's three unfinished films, "A Troll in 
Central Park," "Thumbelina" and "The Pebble and the Penguin." Bluth will 
complete "Thumbelina" for release this year, with "Troll" and "Pebble" to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Also this year, Fox will release the first film from Kirschner's own 
production company, "The Pagemaster," a combination of drawn and computer 
animation with live action. Rich Entertainment Studio is expected to release 
"Swan Lake." In addition, Hyperion Entertainment ("Bebe's Kids"), Universal 
Cartoons Studio and Kroyer Films ("Fern Gully") all have feature deals in 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Animation remains attractive, despite the failures we saw in 1992-93," says 
Kirschner. "The kind of business 'Aladdin' did says to studio heads there is a 
market here if we can tap into it and deliver the right emotions. But I don't 
think you can just casually enter the feature animation business. It requires a 
long-term commitment to the talent and growing that talent in the right 
direction. If you hire artists for a single project, by the time you get to 
know them and how they work, they're off to another studio and another film. 
You want to keep continuity with talented people."

PROPERTY VALUES: BE AWARE OF PROS, CONS BEFORE BUYING A RENTAL TO LIVE IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to live almost rent- and mortgage-free? 
</P>
<P>
 You may be able to do it -- assuming you have a hefty down payment, you're 
willing to give up some privacy and you're lucky enough to find a duplex or 
small apartment building that generates a nice rental income to help cover most 
of the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you rush out, however, be aware that this is no sure investment. 
Indeed, getting the money together for the down payment on several units is 
beyond the reach of many prospective buyers. And, this is one of the toughest 
markets ever for apartment owners in the San Fernando Valley, with rents down 
and vacancy rates up. 
</P>
<P>
 Some buyers who are willing to give up the privacy of a single-family 
residence or condo, however, can find that buying a small multiunit residential 
property and living in one of the units is a good way to build investment 
equity. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Monteleone of real estate brokerage Monteleone & Associates in Sherman 
Oaks reports increasingly brisk activity in the sale of duplexes and other 
small residential income properties in the San Fernando Valley. The number of 
these buildings that sell to owner-occupiers "has been increasing every month," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Monteleone sold a five-unit building in Sherman Oaks to a couple 
for about $550,000. With a $80,000 down payment and a $30,000 second mortgage 
carried back by the seller, and assuming the other units were rented, the 
couple only had to come up with $700 a month out of their own pockets for the 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the building has been fixed up a bit and the rents are up, so the couple 
is living in their unit pretty much for free, Monteleone said. The apartments 
have turned out to be such a good investment, he said, that now the couple can 
consider buying a single-family home for themselves. Like many landlords, 
though, the couple is worried about what happens if one or more of their units 
become vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 On Erwin Street in Van Nuys, Monteleone sold two homes on one lot to four 
investors for $220,000. One of the investors is living in one of the homes and 
paying his share of the mortgage, while the other unit is basically breaking 
even, with the rental income covering the mortgage. All this was done with just 
a 10% down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Monteleone also reported that he has clients who are in escrow on a $190,000 
triplex in Van Nuys. With just 12% down, the $23,000 in projected annual rents 
is enough to cover the mortgage and provide the buyer with a 17% cash-on-cash 
return. Once again, though, rental income is not a sure thing: Some apartments 
can sit vacant for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, according to a survey last year, the Valley's apartment vacancy rate 
was 11.3%, a sizable jump from 7.4% in 1991, according to the Apartment Owners 
Assn. of Southern California. And dealing with a vacant apartment is only one 
of many problems that a prospective duplex or apartment building owner has to 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't that many people who will buy an apartment building and live in 
it these days," said Steve Waterman, a broker with RE/MAX West Realty in 
Woodland Hills. "I have not done a lot of owner/user transactions recently."  
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is a generally lousy market for real estate in the San 
Fernando Valley. And other factors have worked against the sale of duplexes and 
other small apartment buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most buyers don't have the larger down payment usually needed to buy a more 
expensive multiunit property. Also, Waterman said, not everybody is ready to 
deal with the problems that come along with being a landlord. "It takes a 
certain type of person to buy these buildings. You have to deal with more 
complaints than if you're an absentee landlord," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many prospective landlords are also concerned that rents have been decreasing. 
Rents have dropped anywhere from 5% to 25%, depending on the building and the 
area, Waterman said. Apartments that rented for $950 in North Hollywood when 
they were new three or four years ago, he said, are now renting for $750 a 
month -- or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason the market has been less than active is the lack of new 
construction. "They haven't built new duplexes and small apartment buildings in 
most neighborhoods for many years," Waterman said. "If there were newer 
buildings in good locations with modern amenities, there would be more sales," 
Waterman asserted. The way things are now, he said, most of the buildings that 
sell to owner/occupants are in older areas of Reseda, Van Nuys and North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the drawbacks to owning a small-income property, Waterman said, 
now may be the time to think about just such an investment. "It may make more 
sense to buy them, now that many are being sold that generate a positive cash 
flow," he said. "You have to build yourself a margin, however, in case rents 
continue to fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Gersh, an agent at Exclusive Realtors in North Hollywood, said he sees a 
steady flow of primarily foreign-born buyers looking for duplexes and small 
apartment buildings in which to live. Gersh said he recently sold a $350,000 
duplex in North Hollywood to a family that's living in one unit and renting out 
the other. Thanks to $1,100 paid by the tenant every month, the owners are able 
to live in their unit and pay $700 a month from their own pockets for the 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a catch, of course. The buyers had $70,000 as a down payment -- or a 
20% down payment, which is a lot more than is required for most single-family 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers interested in more than four apartment units also can't generally 
qualify for the same type of loans available on small properties. Lenders will 
usually charge a higher interest rate and require about a 30% down payment for 
buildings with more than four units. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most people have trouble putting together hefty down payments, the 
market for apartments has been very weak, Gersh said. A staggering 90% of the 
duplexes he's recently seen sold have been bought by foreign-born buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Max and Bella Gruber have lived among their tenants for 30 years. The Grubers 
have lived in their 28-unit apartment building in Toluca Lake since it was 
built in 1964. "I have good tenants and they don't bother me," Max Gruber said. 
"Knowing that I'm here, they feel more safe and secure." 
</P>
<P>
 Gruber prefers a real hands-on style of management. "When you depend on 
managers, they don't always run the business the way you'd like it. I want to 
control my investment and screen every tenant," he said. "And, as the owner, I 
try harder to please and retain the tenants." 
</P>
<P>
 The Grubers have grown very comfortable in and accustomed to their 
2,200-square-foot-unit. It's just as comfortable as a home, Gruber said, except 
that it's probably a much better investment. Nothing's perfect, though. Four of 
he Grubers' units are vacant, which has obviously curtailed their rental 
income. "There's been lots of overbuilding in the neighborhood," he lamented.

GALPERIN MISSES TARGET ON MLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Ron Galperin's Dec. 7 article regarding the recent legal battles over access 
to a Multiple Listing Service missed the target on the protection afforded by 
copyright law and why Realtors seek to protect the confidentiality of the MLS. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that "thousands of MLS books are discarded" does not mean that one is 
free to reproduce such copyrighted materials. No one at the L. A. Times would 
suggest that the Daily News is free to copy The Times the moment a reader 
discards his daily newspaper. Obviously, Danielle Steele, Tom Clancy, John 
Grisham or any other popular paperback novelist does not lose copyright 
protection when his/her paperback is found in a trash can. It is the same with 
MLS books. 
</P>
<P>
 The MLS is created by its members, who spend a great deal of time and effort 
creating the legal relationships that are thereafter listed in the MLS. These 
MLS members work on behalf of their sellers, many of whom have been harassed 
with a barrage of telephone solicitations and junk mail immediately after 
listing their home for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no mystery why the MLS is copyrighted or why its confidentially receives 
legal protection. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer said it best over 10 years 
ago in her important decision on MLS access: 
</P>
<P>
 "It cannot be doubted that one of the principal benefits to the public of the 
MLS is the opportunity it provides sellers to publicize the availability of 
properties for sale while compromising their privacy and security only to the 
extent necessary to permit approaches by bona fide prospective buyers through 
licensed professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't it say something about a moving company that can only get its business 
leads by rummaging through garbage cans so that it can pilfer information 
created by others? Who would want to entrust their valuable personal 
possessions to such people? That is why the San Fernando Valley Assn. of 
Realtors took action.

RAMS PASS ON DEAL THAT WOULD GIVE EVERETT HIS RELEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Jim Everett is still a Ram, and although the team says it has made 
no decision regarding his future here, the Rams confirmed Monday that they 
passed on an opportunity to give him his outright release in exchange for 
financial considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We discussed it, but we never had an agreement," said John Shaw, Ram 
executive vice president. "If he's not part of our plans for next year, and we 
haven't determined that yet, we will attempt to trade him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams must pay Everett, who is due to earn $2.15 million in base salary in 
1994, an additional $450,000 the day he reports to training camp next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, however, talked in late November with Everett's agent, Marvin 
Demoff, about the possibility of freeing itself at season's end from much of 
that $450,000 obligation in exchange for Everett's outright release.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams believed at the time that they would be unable to trade Everett 
during the off-season because of his poor play in 1993 and huge contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The sides agreed to consider such an option once the season was over, but they 
did not agree on specific financial terms and reached no formal agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Demoff told The Times it would be best if Everett continued his 
career elsewhere. Everett has two years remaining on his Ram contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said Monday he was not sure if such a financial arrangement remained open 
for discussion, but that it no longer mattered because the Rams are not 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Demoff could not be reached for comment, and Everett referred all interview 
requests to Demoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Team sources now believe the Rams can trade Everett, receive as much as a 
conditional second-round draft pick and unload all financial responsibilities 
on Everett's new employer. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL trading period opens Feb. 17, and it appears that the Rams' most 
pressing need is a quarterback to stake their future on. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a quarterback now, a good quarterback," Ram Coach Chuck Knox 
said. "I would say that's an area we need to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, who turned 31 Monday, completed 49.3% of his passes this season 
before losing his starting job to T.J. Rubley. In his eight years with the 
Rams, Everett completed 1,847 of 3,277 passes for 23,758 yards with 142 
touchdowns and 123 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett's last appearance for the Rams this season came in relief of Rubley on 
Dec. 5 at Phoenix. He played in 107 games for the Rams, and went 46-59 as a 
starter. However, in the last four seasons the team went 17-40 under his 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Has Knox decided that Everett must continue his career elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I don't believe that at this particular time," Knox said. "I haven't 
really sat down and thought about it and looked at the options. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm looking at is who is going to take his place? We have a guy who's 
here, and I don't know what we have to replace Jim Everett. We don't know 
what's going to be out there or what we might have access to. I'm not in a 
position now to make a definitive statement until we know what's available." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will start shopping in the free-agent market Feb. 17, and Knox said 
he has been assured by management that the team will be "competitive." The top 
free-agent quarterbacks expected to be available are Miami's Scott Mitchell, 
Atlanta's Chris Miller, San Diego's John Friesz, Detroit's Erik Kramer and 
Kansas City's Dave Krieg. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be very aggressive with free agents," Shaw said. "We're going to 
spend to the salary cap limit." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox praised Rubley's play down the stretch and said Rubley remains in the 
running to be the team's starting quarterback next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played well enough, that if we had everything else going for us, that we 
could win football games with him," Knox said. "I think he's going to be a good 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said the team also will look to the draft to improve itself at 
quarterback. The Rams will select fifth in the first round and are not expected 
to have a shot at the top two prospects, Tennessee's Heath Shuler and Fresno 
State's Trent Dilfer, should they decide to make themselves eligible for the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can address (the quarterback problem) to get immediate help 
in the draft," Knox said. "Historically that has not worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a number of options . . . obviously we're looking for an accurate 
live arm, quick feet and a guy with some height." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like Everett, someone suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got all the skills," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 But most likely, those skills will be used elsewhere next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said the Rams will be looking for more speed during the 
off-season. "We need to upgrade the overall quality of the team so we can play 
better special teams," Knox said. "We need better team speed all the way 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said the team will try to strike early in a bid to sign free agents, and 
will also attempt to quickly re-sign its own 12 unrestricted free agents. "Last 
year there was a perception among a lot of teams that this thing would drag out 
to June," Knox said. "Most of them got signed pretty quick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to take what we have right now and add to it," Knox said. "And 
then let them compete. We're going to be in the draft, but we need to be 
competitive on the free-agent market." RAMS '93: The Numbers Don't Lie 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the near-final NFL statistics before Monday night's Philadelphia-San 
Francisco game helps reveal why the Rams were 5-11 this season. A sample: 18th 
in the 28-team league in overall offense, 24th in defense, 26th in points 
scored and 25th in points allowed. They were last in the league in third-down 
defense, and their special teams were awful (punt returns, 28th, kickoff 
returns, 23rd, punt coverage, 27th, kickoff coverage, 24th). None of this was 
ailback Jerome Bettis' fault. The spectacular rookie, who gained 146 yards on a 
team-record 39 carries in Sunday's 20-6 victory over Chicago, wound up second 
to Dallas' Emmitt Smith in the league rushing rushing race with 1,429 yards, 
helpin the Rams finish fifth in running offense.

AT 13, SHE'S IN BIG TIME; KWAN HAS SHOT AT A TRIP TO LILLEHAMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Too nervous to sleep in the hours before his youngest daughter made her debut 
last winter among the "senior ladies" in the U.S. figure skating championships, 
Danny Kwan decided that pacing was preferable to tossing and turning and had 
almost worn a path in the hotel carpet when he heard mumbling coming from 
Michelle's bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping to listen, he heard his still-sleeping daughter reminding herself, 
"It's nothing. It's nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the words he and Michelle's coach at Lake Arrowhead's International 
Ice Castles Training Center, Frank Carroll, had used to convince her that the 
goal of competing with the seniors was the same as it was with the juniors and 
novices, to have fun and do her best. 
</P>
<P>
 But, now, she was repeating those words over and over again in her dreams, and 
it hit Danny Kwan like a punch to the stomach that the experience to come was 
hardly nothing to his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 She asked for it, he reminded himself. Although she had finished ninth in the 
junior nationals in 1992, she was determined to compete with Olympians such as 
Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding the next year. And, when the time came for 
Southern Californians to take their senior tests, Michelle, who is from 
Torrance, told her father she wanted to go for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask Frank," her father told her. 
</P>
<P>
 When she told him a few days later that her coach had said it was OK, a fib, 
Danny Kwan took her for her senior test, which basically required her to 
perform a senior women's long program, and, even though she had just turned 12, 
she passed, all of which Carroll learned when he returned from a meeting in 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was furious," said Carroll, who did not believe she was mature enough for 
the promotion she had earned. "I sat her down and told her I was captain of 
this ship, and I would decide who were the mutineers." 
</P>
<P>
 But once he reaffirmed his authority, he had to decide how to proceed with a 
senior lady who was not even a teen-ager. After a skater passes her senior 
test, she cannot return to juniors except in the subsequent world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she wanted to be a senior, she had to learn what it took," Carroll said. 
"She had to give up her baby feelings, that, 'I'm tired,' or, 'I'm sick.' I 
told her, 'You have to suffer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The night before she began competition in the 1993 national championships, 
Michelle suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 So did her father. 
</P>
<P>
 If she had asked to drive an automobile on the San Diego Freeway at 12, would 
he have left the decision to her coach simply because she wanted to do it so 
badly, or would he have exerted more parental control and told her that she was 
not ready for such a potentially hazardous journey? 
</P>
<P>
 As he examined his role in his daughter's choices, his own ambitions for her, 
Danny Kwan began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stood there and listened to her talk in her sleep," he said, "and I asked 
myself, 'Is this really what I want for her?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a reporter and photographer arrived at the Lake Arrowhead training center a 
few days before Christmas, Carroll met them outside the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have one request before Michelle arrives," he said. "Could you please not 
ask her anything about the Olympics? I'll answer any questions you have, but 
there will be less pressure on her if she concentrates on skating well and not 
on the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve months ago, any discussion of Kwan and the Winter Olympics would have 
focused on 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this week's national championships at Detroit, which will serve as the 
Olympic trials, she is considered a contender for one of two berths reserved 
for U.S. women next month in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old Kerrigan, bronze medalist in the 1992 Olympics, is conceded 
one of them, and Harding, 23, is favored for the other. She, however, is 
inconsistent, and if this is one of her off weeks, the other berth probably 
will be filled by one of two 16-year-olds, Nicole Bobek or Lisa Ervin. 
</P>
<P>
 Or Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
 If her remarkable sixth-place finish in last year's senior national 
championships in Phoenix, three places higher than her finish the year before 
as a junior, did not alert the figure skating world to her potential, her 
championship six months later in the U.S. Olympic Festival did. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing before 25,691 in San Antonio's Alamodome, the largest crowd to watch 
figure skating anywhere in the world, she seemed so oblivious to her 
surroundings that she might as well have been performing for the squirrels at 
Lake Arrowhead, landing three more triple jumps than Kerrigan had in winning 
the 1993 national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Contending with flu and a sudden growth spurt, which shot her up to 4 feet 11 
and 88 pounds, she appeared to be in over her head for the first time in 
October with a sixth-place finish in Skate America.  
</P>
<P>
 Last month, however, Kwan re-established herself by winning the world junior 
championship in Colorado Springs, Colo. Fourth in that competition was 
Germany's Tanja Szewczenko, who earlier in the year had beaten reigning world 
champion Oksana Baiul and two-time Olympic champion Katarina Witt.  
</P>
<P>
 The reviews are all positive. Patinage, a French figure skating magazine, 
calls her "a small American marvel." Kristi Yamaguchi, the 1992 Olympic 
champion, says Kwan is "much further advanced than I was at 13." Carroll pays 
her the ultimate figure skating compliment, comparing her to U.S. Olympians 
Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill and Linda Fratianne. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has something there beyond talent," he said. "Fratianne was a little 
twink, Dorothy was this little graceful thing, Peggy ethereal. Yet, they were 
three of the strongest individuals I've ever met in my life. They all could 
have been champions at anything they tried. Yes, Michelle has that. 
Definitely." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Carroll did not believe she was ready for the senior nationals at 12, 
could she possibly be ready for the Winter Olympics at 13? 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe she just didn't have the vocal skills to express how much she wanted it 
last year," he said. "But it's worked out fabulously. She has a beautiful body, 
a wonderful face and personality on the ice. She's also got the strongest total 
program of anyone in the nationals. Nobody else is doing seven triple jumps. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she can go out there and do them all, and if she can perform like a senior 
lady and not like someone who just wants to jump her brains out, she's going to 
pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll was eager to begin an afternoon practice, which he knew would be 
disrupted because of a photo session, but Kwan was in a mood for mischief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is your sister?" Carroll asked, referring to 15-year-old Karen, also a 
competitive skater who trains at the International Ice Castles. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's invisible," Kwan said, skating in a circle around him. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're blind," she said, covering her eyes with her hands and continuing to 
skate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michelle," Carroll said firmly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," she said, expressing her exasperation with his refusal to play by 
affecting a mock English accent, "I think she's in the bahth- room." 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll has coached numerous Olympians, his two most famous being Fratianne 
and Christopher Bowman. She was an angel; he was the self-proclaimed Hans 
Brinker from Hell. Kwan is more like Fratianne, but she has a mind of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you told Linda to jump off the roof, she jumped off the roof," Carroll 
said. "This kid wants a little more input into it. She has respect for me, but 
I don't scare her." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she put her contrary side on display. It was even colder than usual in 
the rink because of a heating problem and a shivering Kwan began to grumble, 
making it clear that posing for the photographer was an imposition. But she did 
not quit until he did. 
</P>
<P>
 With the national championships on the horizon, media requests for her time 
have been frequent, and where there is media exposure, there are agents. Danny 
Kwan has put them on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michelle is not ready for an agent," he said. "She is nobody, just a young 
athlete. I want to keep it all in perspective, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 But without an agent, responding to media requests has been left to Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
 He usually does it with one word: no. 
</P>
<P>
 "When ABC called, they said, 'What do you mean you don't want to do this? 
Don't you realize this is prime time? Don't you realize what this is worth?' " 
Carroll said. "I told them, 'Yes, but you're not going to want to talk to her 
in the future if she doesn't do well at nationals.' So what's more important, 
going on television or preparing for the competition?" 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle, however, has done enough interviews in the last year that she knows 
the routine. She sat in on news conferences at Skate America so that she could 
learn how veterans such as Brian Boitano and Harding give enthusiastic 
responses to the same tired questions they have heard for years, but, as became 
obvious during a conversation, she has yet to master the art. 
</P>
<P>
 She started skating when she was 5 because she enjoyed watching her older 
brother play hockey. She was not very good at first, "falling on the ice and 
holding onto the rail like normal people." She won her first competition at 7 
1/2. She defied her coach last year and took her senior test because she 
"wanted to go up to see and compete with the big people." She misses her 
friends at school, but she writes to them while she takes eighth-grade 
correspondence courses. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a sparkle in her eyes when the discussion turned to the Winter 
Olympics, a subject she broached.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I watched the Olympics on television (in 1988), I knew I 
wanted to be there some day," she said. "I thought I could just go there, like, 
'OK, tomorrow, I'll go to the Olympics.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But, as if realizing she had entered forbidden territory, she quickly added, 
"I never think about the Olympics. It's like my dad says, 'Everything coming 
your way right now is extra. Just give it your best shot and take what comes to 
you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her eyes really lit up, however, when she talked about a pet squirrel she once 
had, a bear that dined each night last summer from the cafeteria garbage bin, 
and a tent she built on the training-center grounds with plastic trash bags. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you get with Michelle is such a normal, natural 13-year-old that the 
potential stardom hasn't hit her," Carroll said. "She wants to be a champion, 
but that whole other side, she doesn't have any awareness of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't it be great if she stays like this?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "You have kids?" Danny Kwan asked over dinner at the Golden Pheasant, a 
Chinese restaurant in Torrance that his wife's family owns. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he is told. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're lucky," he said, perhaps at that moment only half-joking as he 
considered the evening ahead.  
</P>
<P>
 Danny, 44, was about to embark upon his nightly two-hour drive "up the hill" 
to Lake Arrowhead, where he would stay overnight with his two daughters in a 
cottage at the training center before returning the next morning to his job as 
a systems analyst with Pacific Bell. His wife, Estella, 42, remains in Torrance 
to manage the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're still just babies, so somebody has to keep an eye on them," Danny 
said of Michelle and Karen. "I tell them, 'You're not a sacrifice.' If they 
want something, we as their parents will pay the price for it. If they don't 
want it, it's a sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny and Estella met and married in Hong Kong, where he had emigrated with 
his parents from China as a 9-year-old, but although they have been in the 
United States for 22 years, he still does not quite understand the almost 
religious fervor with which Americans follow sports and sports heroes. Frankly, 
it frightens him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He comes here every night because he wants to maintain the family unit, the 
values," said Carol Probst, who, with her husband, Walter, owns and operates 
the International Ice Castles, a skating center unique in the United States. 
Their foundation provides scholarships so that talented, middle-class skaters 
such as the Kwans can afford to remain in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Danny said, there is more to it than that. He wants to be there each 
night to remind his daughters that there is more to life than figure skating, a 
lesson that he had to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is probably the most level-headed parent we have," Probst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last winter, however, he had a reputation as a skating father, which is 
to the sport what a stage mother is to acting. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed when he heard Michelle's mutterings in her sleep in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you love your daughter, do you want to see her stressed?" he said. "Does 
it make sense to give a sport a lot of time and a lot of money just to make her 
crazy? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I had to ask myself what this is all about, and my answer is the one I 
give her. Figure skating is a sport; it is not life. The lessons she learns now 
will be important to her in the future. Work hard, do your best, learn how to 
step up as a winner and how to take a defeat. But that is all they are, lessons 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wants to go to the Olympics. I can tell you that for sure. She didn't 
think she had a shot at it. Now she does. But do the Olympics mean that much? I 
don't know. It really bothers me that there's so much emphasis on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "These athletes are under so much heat. I think about Donnie Moore. I think 
about that pitcher for the Phillies (Mitch Williams). The whole city wanted to 
kill that guy. It's scary, really damn scary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fine as long as she enjoys it. But when I feel she is stressed, it's 
time to quit. I tell her, 'If you want to quit today, that's OK with me.' I 
really mean it. Her achievements are beyond my expectations. But it's not OK 
for her yet. She wants to be a champion." 
</P>
<P>
 But every day Danny Kwan accompanies his young daughter to the rink, he 
shudders at the double meaning hidden in the sign at the entrance, "Skate At 
Your Inherent Risk."

JIM MURRAY: HIS MASTERPIECE WENT UNFINISHED AT THE COLISEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't know about you, but I go to see John Elway play quarterback the same 
way I'd go to hear Caruso sing, Or Kelly dance, Shoemaker ride, Jordan dunk, 
Mays field, Andretti drive, Nicklaus putt, Dempsey punch, Ruth bat. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like watching an artist paint. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, you don't go to the opera to see how it came out. You go to hear 
Pavarotti hit the notes. You go to see "Singin' in the Rain" not to see who 
gets the girl, but Gene Kelly climbing lamp posts. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not so much a game as it is a recital. John Albert Elway at the keyboard. 
I mean, who's keeping score?  
</P>
<P>
 Elway with the ball is as exciting a sight as there is in sports. In his own 
field, there's nothing close. Oh, I know Joe Montana has been more successful 
(in winning Super Bowls, not necessarily getting to them), but I don't think 
you get the same charge when Montana drops back as you do when Elway does. 
</P>
<P>
 You get the feeling he's never more than one flick of the wrist from an 
80-yard touchdown pass. Other quarterbacks move their teams down the field like 
a guy laying carpet, but Elway is much more explosive than that.  
</P>
<P>
 You also have the notion he could complete a pass to a janitor. Let's face it, 
Montana had Rice, Unitas had Lenny Moore and Raymond Berry, even Waterfield had 
Hirsch. Elway has What's-his-name?  
</P>
<P>
 Quarterbacks come from western Pennsylvania. Check it out: Joe Namath, Jim 
Kelly, Joe Montana, John Unitas, Dan Marino, to name a few. Elway comes from 
Stanford. The San Fernando Valley. He should have been a surfer. Had a board -- 
or a guitar -- in his hands instead of a football. He overcame this 
underprivileged background. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, he is the Denver Broncos. I mean, you'd hate to see them without 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Take last Sunday. The first six times Denver got the ball, Elway drove them 
down the field to a score. There were three touchdown passes, three field 
goals. He presented his team with 20-7, 27-10 and 30-13 leads. The Broncos 
first punted with 1 minute 20 seconds to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 When the game went into overtime, Elway's team got the ball and he promptly 
drove them down to the Raiders' 23-yard line for what appeared to be a routine 
game-winning field goal. It was missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway completed 25 of 36 passes, which would have been good even if half of 
them were completed behind the line of scrimmage. But one touchdown pass was 
good for 54 yards, another for 27. And in overtime, he completed one pass for 
20 yards and another for 30. Armed and dangerous, Elway with a football is John 
Wayne with a 10-gauge. You better scatter. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a legend chasing legends. His 34,246 yards put him some distance from 
Fran Tarkenton's all-time 47,003, but not that far from Dan Fouts' second place 
of 43,040 or Unitas' 40,239. And with a five-year contract at 34, Elway has 
only Montana and Marino to pass among active players. And Air Elway, unlike Air 
Jordan, is not contemplating retiring,  
</P>
<P>
 After a game in which he threw for three touchdowns, 361 yards and 25 
completions, Elway revealed that he had done it all through a haze of flu. The 
Raiders were chasing a sick man all day. 
</P>
<P>
 They still couldn't catch him. Elway is as hard to sack as a coop full of 
chickens. Even with his back turned, he seems to sense the precise millisecond 
when he has to let go of the ball before the lineman's paw is about to descend 
on his neck. Does he have the protective mechanism of Unitas, who was said to 
have such peripheral vision that he could see his ears?  
</P>
<P>
 Elway smiles, shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I listen to the crowd," he says. "In most cases, you can tell how close the 
pursuit is by their excitement. When (Greg) Townsend got near me today, my 
teammates were yelling at me." 
</P>
<P>
 So, it's not peripheral? 
</P>
<P>
 "Naw. It's preservation," Elway says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 An interception-touchdown ratio of one to one is usually considered acceptable 
in the NFL. Elway's ratio this season is 25 touchdowns to 10 interceptions.  
</P>
<P>
 Because it was 4,890 attempts ago, Elway has no recollection of his first pro 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I do remember I was one for eight that day," he says. "I think they were 
considering me to hold for place kicks." 
</P>
<P>
 He is at his most dangerous when the game is on the line. The Broncos' staff 
has toted up 31 times he has engineered fourth-quarter drives to save the game 
for Denver. The most famous was the AFC championship game against Cleveland 
that put Elway's team into the Super Bowl in early 1987. Elway went 98 yards in 
15 plays and threw a five-yard touchdown pass to Mark Jackson, sending the game 
into overtime. Then he drove the Broncos 60 yards in nine plays to the winning 
field goal.  
</P>
<P>
 So, he gave his team a 30-13 lead Sunday with a quarter left to play. And then 
he drove the offense into field-goal range in the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Mozart never conducted a symphony better. Olivier never handled Shakespeare 
any better. If it was art you came to see, Elway didn't disappoint. The rest 
was arithmetic.

COMMENTARY; SPENDING SPREE LEFT THIS CROWD IN RED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With apologies to John Maynard Keynes, supply and demand met in Pasadena on 
New Year's Day, when the price of loyalty was set at $500 a soul. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the contribution to the California economy made by fans from Wisconsin, 
the tariff lavished on anybody who would sell a seat to the Rose Bowl and allow 
them to turn a Southern California stadium into Camp Randall, minus the 
wind-chill factor. 
</P>
<P>
 The game generated one of the great loaves-and-fishes tricks of our time, a 
21,000-ticket Big Ten allocation turning into about 70,000 wearing red and 
chasing bratwurst with beer while they drowned out UCLA boosters who bought 
41,636 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 That's 70,000 plus 41,606, which totals about 10,000 more than the Rose Bowl 
will allow, even with fire marshals out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't happen. And it didn't happen. At least it didn't happen without help 
from those with Westwood connections who have spent the past eight seasons 
complaining that their Bruins were otherwise occupied on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Players got four tickets, and some wanted as many as 30 for family and 
friends. There was a student allotment, and 4,600 tickets were sold there at 
$46 each. The 21,000 season-ticket holders got a seat-for-seat offer, and 
athletic donors were allowed to buy a few extra in recognition of their 
generosity.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific 10 Conference got about 7,500, to be split among the membership at 
500 per school, 1,000 to USC because the Rose Bowl is in Southern California. 
Reporters were allowed to buy from the Pac-10, and many did. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tournament of Roses Committee got most of the rest, save for a 
public-lottery sale of 4,500. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened? Why the sea of Badger red in the Rose Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere, somehow, about 45,000-50,000 residential, if not emotional, ties to 
the West Coast were severed by a checkbook. Turning $46 into $500 was a 
temptation many could not resist, particularly when a broker put cards on 
windshields in UCLA campus parking lots, offering top dollar for tickets, "no 
questions asked." 
</P>
<P>
 It's called the secondary market, and there is evidence of a tertiary market 
or, for that matter, fourth- and fifth-place markets. Apparently, tickets 
changed hands over and over again as they increased in value because of the 
tremendous number of Wisconsin fans who had gone without this sort of 
excitement since 1963.  
</P>
<P>
 To them, price was no object. Two weeks before the Rose Bowl, $180 was 
offered. The frenzy apparently was fed by Christmas cash and the price built to 
$500 by New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
 The process was spurred by those who took their fun and football team 
personally, and was further prodded by a coach who learned the art of 
poor-mouth on the staff of Lou Holtz at Notre Dame.  
</P>
<P>
 Barry Alvarez talked of UCLA's home field advantage from the minute Wisconsin 
accepted the Rose Bowl bid, thereby inciting folks who call each other 
cheeseheads, but dare you to do it.  
</P>
<P>
 He got help from Las Vegas, which established the Badgers as decided 
underdogs, and from history, which showed Wisconsin football has lacked merit 
since Roosevelt was president. Teddy Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 "C'mon, what do the UCLA players and fans really think about Wisconsin?" the 
talk-show host in Milwaukee asked the Southern California reporter. "They 
really think we're in a rural, dairy state, nothing but rubes and farmers, 
right? And wouldn't UCLA rather be playing Michigan or Ohio State, the big 
names of the Big Ten? UCLA isn't taking Wisconsin seriously, is it?" 
</P>
<P>
 As it became clear late in the week that enough tickets could not be had at 
any price to supply Wisconsinites who wanted to be there -- was anybody left in 
Madison to watch the bank? -- the demand for, and the price of, tickets kept 
increasing in huge jumps. And by game time, it seemed obvious that much of the 
Badger demand had been supplied by Southern Californians who would have been 
rooting differently, had they been there. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes before kickoff Saturday, Badger fans streamed from parties on the 
Brookside Park golf course into the Rose Bowl in such force that the tunnels 
were blocked and progress was made by inches. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA fans sat on their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez had told his players to expect a home-field atmosphere, and they got 
it. Badger fans got into the spirit of things, and UCLA players picked a lousy 
time to get into the trash business. The Bruins talked a good game, then fell 
behind, 14-3, before they self-destructed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stands, Wisconsin fans' emotions, already sky-high, went into outer 
space. In some sections, it got as ugly as a Raider game. UCLA fans, normally 
placid, became moribund. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has a corps of rooters that ebbs and flows with the team's record, but 
seldom far in either direction because of a general malaise. When you can draw 
only 40,000 this season to watch the Bruins, on a three-game winning streak, 
play a key game against Washington in the Rose Bowl, you've said it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key Bruin game was Oct. 30, against Arizona, when enough Wildcat fans 
were in evidence to give UCLA a crowd of 66,656 in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA won that game, 37-17, and it was the high-water mark of the Bruin season 
as far as fan emotions went. 
</P>
<P>
 The low was Saturday in the Rose Bowl, for a road game at home.

COMMENTARY; THE POLLS GOT IT RIGHT, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'll admit it: The poll system is as oily as a can of SAE-30. There are 
Associated Press voters with grudges. There are coaches with agendas. The whole 
thing is enough to make you wish for a playoff plan that actually worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the pettiness, the hypocrisy and the inexactness of it all, the 
best team won the national championship. Say what you will about the methods 
used in the two polls, Florida State doesn't owe anyone an apology. When the 
Seminoles' name is engraved on the respective trophies, there will be no 
asterisk. 
</P>
<P>
 My AP ballot read: 1, Florida State; 2, Notre Dame; 3, Nebraska; 4, Auburn, 
and 5, Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 For what it's worth, I considered splitting my first-place vote between the 
Seminoles and the Irish, but then decided that wouldn't be fair to either team. 
So I cast it for 12-1 Florida State, even though 11-1 Notre Dame had beaten the 
Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Irish Coach Lou Holtz has intimated that a conspiracy exists 
against him and his program. Word is, Oliver Stone is considering an option to 
the movie rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M Coach R.C. Slocum, whose team was beaten by the Irish in last 
Saturday's Cotton Bowl, also has criticized voters for choosing Florida State 
No. 1, going so far as to say: "This will give more momentum to establishing 
some type of formula where it's not just something off the top of someone's 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne has told reporters that the Cornhuskers' 18-16 loss 
to Florida State in the Orange Bowl was deceiving. "As far as I'm concerned, we 
won," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, well, that might account for the Cornhuskers' lone first-place vote in 
the coaches' poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden fell victim to the hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after beating Nebraska Saturday night, Bowden announced that Notre 
Dame was the second-best team in the country. But when it came time to vote, 
Bowden wrote in the Cornhuskers, not the Irish, at No. 2. It was a blatant 
example of a coach manipulating his vote to benefit his own team. 
</P>
<P>
 And it happens all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The most disturbing of the accusations -- if you can characterize Holtz's 
comments as accusations -- was the idea that some voters, media representatives 
and coaches alike, purposely stick it to the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that really disturbs me is the newspaper article about when 
the field goal went through, 25 or 30 writers broke out into a loud round of 
applause and started high-fiving each other," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz was referring to Notre Dame's last-second loss to Boston College in the 
final regular-season game for the Irish. Back in Ann Arbor, Mich., several 
dozen reporters were working on their stories from that day's Michigan-Ohio 
State game. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in the Wolverine press box and, like everyone else, was glued to the 
television as Boston College staged its remarkable comeback and upset. As the 
winning kick went through the uprights, the place did indeed go crazy. I saw 
high-fives exchanged, heard the yells, even saw one voting sportswriter hug a 
Michigan sports information official. 
</P>
<P>
 But a conspiracy? Doubtful. In fact, the hugging sportswriter recently cast 
his first-place vote for Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral of the story: You might not like Holtz or the Irish, but you can't 
help but admire and respect what they have accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz also can be forgiven for his paranoia. It's the nature of the business. 
But to suggest that Notre Dame might have lost a national championship because 
of a voting bias is to cheapen Florida State's accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 62 AP voters and 62 voting coaches. I don't know about the 36 
coaches or the 45 other reporters who cast their ballots for the Seminoles, but 
my preference for No. 1 had nothing to do with personality. It had to do with 
performance: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Florida State won 12 games, Notre Dame 11. Florida State's opponents had a 
combined pre-bowl record of 77-57 (57.5%), Notre Dame's opponents were 59-63 
(48.4%). Florida State played two teams with nine victories, one team with 10 
and two teams with 11. Notre Dame played a nine-victory, a 10-victory and a 
12-victory team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Florida State, which went to the Orange Bowl as the No. 1-ranked AP team, 
beat Nebraska, ranked No. 1 in the coaches' and coalition polls and No. 2 in 
the AP. Notre Dame, No. 4 in the AP and coaches' polls, spent its New Year's 
Day defeating the Aggies, who were No. 7 in the AP and No. 6 on the coaches' 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 As did Florida State, the Irish struggled to a bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Florida State, ranked No. 1 at the time, lost to Notre Dame, 31-24 . . . on 
the road and with the second-ranked Irish having had two weeks to prepare. Fair 
enough. But the then-No. 1 Irish lost the next week to then-No. 17 Boston 
College -- the same team that had lost to Northwestern earlier in the season -- 
at home, and gave up 41 points doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's gag-a-thon against the Eagles nullified all the good it had done 
by beating Florida State. Yes, Notre Dame outplayed the Seminoles. Yes, Kez 
McCorvey's tipped touchdown reception transformed a 31-17 Irish lead to a 
better-looking 31-24 score. But outplayed or not, Florida State had a chance to 
tie and possibly win the game in the waning moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz says the Game of the Century apparently didn't count for anything. It 
did, but so did the Game of the Week against Boston College.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the comparison to 1989, when Miami and Notre Dame finished with one 
loss apiece, but the Hurricanes got the title based on head-to-head 
competition, we don't buy Holtz's reversal in philosophy. In 1989, he argued 
one way. Four years later, his team in Miami's position, he gets religion. 
Interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 This was my first year as an AP voter and I'll shed no tear if it's my last. 
But based on a season and not a single game, Florida State was the narrow 
choice as No. 1. The Seminoles earned it in spite of a poll system badly in 
need of repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Or better yet, in need of a replacement.

HEARING EARLIER RESULT THAT PUT TEAM IN MUST-WIN SITUATION AGAINST BRONCOS.

<P>
 With eight seconds to play in regulation Sunday at the Coliseum, the Raiders 
lined up at the Denver Broncos' four-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 30-23, this was going to be the last play of the game for the 
Raiders unless they could get a game-tying touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 And because the Pittsburgh Steelers had beaten the Cleveland Browns earlier in 
the day, this was also going to be the last play of the season unless the 
Raiders scored. Had Pittsburgh lost, the Raiders would have automatically 
qualified for postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 But as it was, the Raiders had to win or tie to avoid being be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 A national viewing audience knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the capacity Coliseum crowd knew it.  
</P>
<P>
 But Coach Art Shell didn't know it. 
</P>
<P>
 And he didn't want his players to know it. 
</P>
<P>
 All week long, Shell had waved off people who had tried to outline the ways 
the Raiders could sneak into the playoffs even if they lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just got to win," he told one and all. 
</P>
<P>
 And Shell lived by those words Sunday, avoiding all opportunities to learn the 
score from Pittsburgh, and the one from New England, where the Patriots' game 
against the Miami Dolphins also could have had a bearing on the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not know," Shell said. "None of the players knew. I didn't want to 
know. Our focus had to be on this game. We must win the game ourselves. We 
can't depend on anybody else. You start depending on somebody else, you don't 
get things done." 
</P>
<P>
 So even at halftime, with the Steeler and Dolphin games long over and his team 
trailing, 27-13, Shell made no effort to learn what the other teams had done.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were mad," Shell said. "We were down. We couldn't concentrate on 
Pittsburgh. We had to concentrate on the Denver Broncos." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only after the Raiders tied the score on the final play of regulation 
on a four-yard touchdown pass from Jeff Hostetler to Alexander Wright, only 
after Jeff Jaeger kicked the 47-yard field goal that gave the Raiders a 33-30 
overtime victory that Shell was told by Raider executive assistant Al LoCasale 
that Pittsburgh had won and that Miami had not lost by a big enough margin to 
help the Raiders. * 
</P>
<P>
 Shell might not have paid attention to the out-of-town scores, but he paid 
plenty of attention to the score of his own game. 
</P>
<P>
 When it went into overtime, Shell knew that it would almost certainly be 
decided by a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 So he geared his decisions to the man who would ultimately have to live with 
them -- Jaeger, his kicker. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Raiders lost the coin toss in overtime, they were at least allowed to 
choose which end of the field to defend. 
</P>
<P>
 They could have forced Denver to go from the peristyle end to the closed end, 
subjecting quarterback John Elway to the noisier closed end if he should put 
together a drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jaeger prefers to kick into the closed end because of a better background. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Raiders chose Jaeger's favorite side. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Broncos' Jason Elam missed a 40-yard kick at the peristyle end, 
Hostetler drove the Raiders down to the closed end. 
</P>
<P>
 When play stopped for a moment with the Raiders still far out of field-goal 
range, Jaeger ran out onto the field and surveyed the scene, checking the 
background in the setting sun, the soft breeze and the barely noticeable air 
currents. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided that the ideal would be to kick from the left hash mark, preferably 
inside the 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "What wind there was was going right to left," Jaeger said. "In my mind, I 
wanted to play it right-center and let it drift back in." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell got the message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew which hash he wanted," Shell said, "I knew which yard line he needed 
to go to and where he wanted the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell delivered. Jaeger got the ball in the closed end, left hash, 47 yards 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 And then he delivered.

ANALYSIS; THESE GAMES HAVE A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 No sooner than you can say, "That 59-year-old man punched who? " the NFL 
postseason has arrived, and just in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Much in the manner of the nine clubs heading into the playoffs with winning 
streaks, the league has saved its best for last. 
</P>
<P>
 After a regular season featuring about five great weeks of football stretched 
over 18, prepare for a month that won't seem long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs have suspense: Who will Buddy Ryan slug next? 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the Houston Oilers hope that their defensive coordinator doesn't 
waste his energy on another coach. A left hook to Warren Moon's ribs might be 
nice. 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs have domestic unrest: The Pittsburgh Steelers' offensive and 
defensive units are barely speaking to each other.  
</P>
<P>
 In a halftime meeting Sunday, linebacker Greg Lloyd harangued his teammates on 
offense as slackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Neil O'Donnell replied with something witty like, "Takes one to 
call one." 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs have intrigue: Dan Reeves, coach of the New York Giants, changed 
the way he called plays Sunday after wondering if the Dallas Cowboys were 
stealing his signs from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing is, if you're going to steal signs, you have to assume that 
your defense knows what to do with them," said Bart Oates, the Giants' center. 
"We all know defensive players have enough trouble just figuring out who to 
tackle." 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs have inspiration: Emmitt Smith played so hard and so hurt Sunday 
for the Cowboys, he walked from the winning drive to the hospital, where he 
spent the night after having his separated shoulder treated. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will be the biggest problem for any team in the playoffs -- figuring out 
a way to stop No. 22," Giant linebacker Corey Miller said. "Man beat us all by 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs have comebacks: Barry Sanders is expected to return to the field 
for the Detroit Lions after sitting out parts of six games because of a knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Bills are expected to return to the AFC championship game for the 
fourth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess which event most fans are anticipating more? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to see us in the Super Bowl again, which has led to our goal 
this year," Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly said. "Make everybody mad." 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs have youthful enthusiasm: One day after losing to the Lions, 
setting up a rematch in Detroit this weekend, Green Bay Packer quarterback 
Brett Favre spoke bravely. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he wished he could have stayed on the field Sunday and started the 
playoff game immediately after the regular-season game had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 So did the Lions. They picked off four of Favre's passes, saddling him with a 
league-high 24 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 One interception came on the kind of pass most often seen in a schoolyard 
game, Favre flinging the ball into the air as he was being sacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he was attempting to throw the ball away, then that's not how you do it," 
Packer Coach Mike Holmgren said. "If he was trying to complete the ball to 
somebody, that's still not how you do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs have injustices: Kicker Jeff Jaeger of the Raiders tied a 
10-year-old NFL record for most field goals in a season with 35, yet did not 
make the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants' defense led the league in fewest points given up, yet none of 
their players made the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Gilbride, Oiler offensive coordinator and the object of Ryan's 
affections, never had a chance to punch back. 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs have Joe: The Kansas City Chiefs' public relations office 
received 85 calls about Montana on Sunday. Nearly every caller had only one 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Montana is sound and will start Saturday against the Pittsburgh Steelers 
in his first playoff appearance in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he is still the best postseason quarterback ever, with a 14-5 record, a 
record 4,758 postseason yards passing, a record 39 touchdowns, and only 17 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 That should be the best first-round game, with the Chiefs possibly traveling 
to Houston for the most interesting second-round match. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys, meanwhile, already have the second round figured out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leaving the field, several of their guys told me they expected to be seeing 
us in Dallas in two weeks," Giant linebacker Miller said. "We expect to be 
there too." 
</P>
<P>
 Wonder if the Minnesota Vikings' Jim McMahon, who has led the team to eight 
victories in the 11 games in which he has played at least one quarter, will 
have anything to say about that. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that seems predestined -- and the NFL is already crossing its 
fingers in anticipation -- is two provocative championship-game matchups. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't Steve Young love a chance to bring the San Francisco 49ers to Dallas 
and defeat a younger quarterback who has beaten him not only on the field, but 
in the hearts of those fans who voted for the Pro Bowl players? Troy Aikman 
awaits. 
</P>
<P>
 And aren't the Oilers excited about a chance to redeem themselves for blowing 
a 32-point lead against the Bills in last year's playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is just calisthenics for Jan. 30 in Atlanta, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible titles for the big game include the All-Texas Super Bowl. This would 
be Houston vs. Dallas, a truly sexy matchup when one considers it is Ryan 
against Jimmy Johnson, who has accused Ryan of being a bounty hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a chance of an All-49er Super Bowl. This would be much more than 
the 49ers vs. the Chiefs, it would be Young vs. that shadow named Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 How about an All-Giant-Quarterbacks-Who-Just-Find-a-Way-To-Win Super Bowl? 
Announcers for a game between Jeff Hostetler's Raiders and Phil Simms' Giants 
would set a record for usage of the term hard-nosed.  
</P>
<P>
 Before you get too excited, realize we could end up with an All-Losers Super 
Bowl. The Vikings and Denver Broncos are a combined 0-8 in the big game. 
</P>
<P>
 What fun that would be. Maybe McMahon could moon himself.

RAMS PASS ON DEAL TO GIVE EVERETT RELEASE; PRO FOOTBALL: SOURCES SAY THE TEAM 
NOW BELIEVES THE QUARTERBACK CAN BE TRADED FOR A CONDITIONAL DRAFT PICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Everett remains a Ram, and although the team says it has made no decision 
regarding his future, management confirmed Monday that it passed on an 
opportunity to give him his outright release in exchange for financial 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We discussed it, but we never had an agreement," said John Shaw, Ram 
executive vice president. "If he's not part of our plans for next year, and we 
haven't determined that yet, we will attempt to trade him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams must pay Everett, who is due to earn $2.15 million in base salary in 
1994, an additional $450,000 the day he reports to training camp next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, however, talked in late November with Everett's agent, Marvin 
Demoff, about the possibility of freeing itself at season's end from much of 
that $450,000 by giving Everett his release and the opportunity to sign 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams believed at the time that they would be unable to trade Everett 
during the off-season because of his poor play and huge contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The sides agreed to consider such an option once the season was over, but did 
not agree on specific financial terms at the time and reached no formal 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Demoff told The Times that it would be best if Everett continued 
his career elsewhere. Everett has two years remaining on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said Monday, however, that he was not sure if such a financial 
arrangement remained open for discussion, and that it no longer mattered 
because the Rams aren't interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Demoff could not be reached for comment, and Everett referred all interview 
requests to Demoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Team sources now say the Rams can trade Everett, receive as much as a 
conditional second-round pick and unload all financial responsibilities on 
Everett's new employer. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL trading period opens Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a quarterback now, a good quarterback," Coach Chuck Knox 
said. "I would say that's an area we need to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, who turned 31 Monday, completed 49.3% of his passes this season 
before losing his starting job to T.J. Rubley. In his eight years with the 
Rams, Everett has completed 1,847 of 3,277 passes for 23,758 yards with 142 
touchdowns and 123 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett's last game for the Rams this season was in relief of Rubley at 
Phoenix on Dec. 5. He played in 107 games for the Rams, and was 46-59 as a 
starter. In the past four seasons he was 17-40. 
</P>
<P>
 Must Everett continue his career elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I don't believe that at this particular time," Knox said. "I haven't 
really sat down and thought about it and looked at the options. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm looking at is, who is going to take his place? We have a guy that's 
here, and I don't know what we have to replace Jim Everett. We don't know 
what's going to be out there or what we might have access to. I'm not in 
position now to make a definitive statement until we know what's available." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will start shopping in the free-agent market Feb. 17, and Knox said 
he has been assured by management that the team will be competitive. The top 
free-agent quarterbacks expected to be available are Miami's Scott Mitchell, 
Atlanta's Chris Miller, San Diego's John Friesz, Detroit's Erik Kramer and 
Kansas City's Dave Krieg. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be very aggressive with free agents," Shaw said. "We're going to 
spend to the salary cap limit." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said the team will also look to the draft to improve itself at 
quarterback. The Rams will select fifth in the first round and are not expected 
to have a shot at either of the top two prospects, Tennessee's Heath Shuler and 
Fresno State's Trent Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can address (the quarterback problem) to get immediate help 
in the draft," Knox said. "Historically, that has not worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a number of options. . . . Obviously we're looking for an accurate 
live arm, quick feet and a guy with some height." 
</P>
<P>
 Such as Everett? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got all the skills," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 But they probably will be used elsewhere next season.

SANTA ANA VALLEY'S MANN IS FLASHY -- RIGHT DOWN TO HIS SOCKS; BASKETBALL: SINCE 
TRANSFERRING FROM MATER DEI, SOPHOMORE GUARD HAS SHOWN A FLAIR FOR THE 
SPECTACULAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley boys' basketball Coach Rich Prospero was in no mood for 
jokes. With basketballs pounding in the gymnasium at 7 a.m. on an October 
morning, a girl crossed the floor to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls' basketball team was practicing and this girl comes up to me and 
says, 'Boy, are you going to get a great transfer. My brother is leaving Mater 
Dei,' " Prospero said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was Candace Mann, a freshman at Santa Ana Valley. Her brother is 
Olujimi, a 6-foot-4 sophomore who quickly has established himself as one of the 
finest point guards in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mann played a significant role in helping Mater Dei win the Southern 
Section Division I-A championship last season, he transferred to Santa Ana 
Valley in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family couldn't afford to send me there anymore," Mann said. "It's the 
best program in Southern California, and it felt like a college program, but it 
just cost too much to go there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been going to public schools all of my life, so for school, it's been an 
easy transition leaving Mater Dei and coming here." 
</P>
<P>
 On the court, Mann is also doing fine. He has averaged 21 points, seven 
rebounds and five assists while helping the Falcons, ranked third in the 
county, to a 13-2 start. The losses have come against Lynwood and Bellflower 
St. John Bosco, both ranked among the top 10 of the state's preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
 While Prospero enjoys watching Mann quarterback his offense, his first 
experience with him wasn't a pleasant one. Mann helped Mater Dei destroy Santa 
Ana Valley, 111-31, in the semifinals of last season's Daily Pilot Tipoff 
classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Olujimi played some that night, but I don't remember much; the whole game was 
a nightmare," Prospero said.  
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for Prospero to see why scouts were raving about the 
sophomore guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you first see him, you might think, 'Well, there is this 6-4 point guard 
who is a great athlete, but maybe his shooting is a weakness,' " Prospero said. 
"But right off the bat, his shooting impressed me. He's near 50% on three-point 
shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Those talents prompted Mann's former coach, Gary McKnight of Mater Dei, to say 
last season that Mann could average triple-doubles -- double figures in points, 
assists and rebounds -- by his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann has been compared to former NBA star Reggie Theus, and according to 
Prospero, Chapman University Coach Mike Bokosky told him Mann could develop 
into the "finest player ever to come out of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 But Prospero is guarded when speaking about Mann. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you could say things that would be unfair to Olujimi in terms of 
expectations because he's so young and so talented," Prospero said. "He's a 
very unique individual. He loves basketball and I think he always will work to 
improve on his weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those weaknesses could be Mann's flair for the spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 With his quick, lanky frame, Mann can dribble behind his back without missing 
a beat, then find an open teammate with a no-look pass or simply swish a 
three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 And like Magic Johnson, one of his idols, Mann has a thirst for crowd-pleasing 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting out to lead the fast break and setting up my teammates, I love that," 
Mann said. "That gets me hyped." 
</P>
<P>
 But with the flashy successes come some turnovers and ill-advised shots, 
things that would make some coaches scream and holler. But Prospero takes them 
in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "As coaches, we have to guide players so I subtly remind him of things I don't 
like," Prospero said. "I think he needs to tone down his turnovers and not be 
as flashy, but that's something he's going to learn on the court; how he can 
make himself and the team more productive. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the big thing is Olujimi always tries to make his teammates better. So 
since he does that, I don't have any squabble with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann's flashiness goes right down to his wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 His superstitious secret to success? It's gotta be . . . the socks ? 
</P>
<P>
 On his left foot, Mann has one sock pulled all the way up to his kneecap. On 
the right, a mismatched sock stays just above his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 So what gives? 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year during the Tournament of Champions, Coach McKnight put me in and I 
just forgot to pull one up," Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the one-sock-down mode, Mann scored 13 points and helped Mater Dei defeat 
Huntington Beach, 64-46, in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since then, I've always worn my socks that way," Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
 And socks up or down, Prospero will stick with his enthusiastic young leader.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Alamitos quarterback Mike Good has made an oral commitment to attend 
Northern Arizona, his father, Fred, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Good, a second-team Times' All-Orange County selection, picked Northern 
Arizona, a Division I-AA school, over Idaho State, Nevada, Nevada Las Vegas and 
Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
 Good, a 6-foot, 185-pound senior, led the Griffins to their third consecutive 
Southern Section championship and passed for more than 2,900 yards and 35 
touchdowns.

WISCONSIN INVESTIGATES TICKET FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As fans returned from the Rose Bowl with tales of woe, Attorney General James 
E. Doyle said Monday the state would investigate possible fraud by companies 
who offered game tickets but didn't deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 And Gov. Tommy G. Thompson said he received a call from the chairman of the 
Federal Trade Commission promising an investigation into whether interstate 
commerce laws were broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people had bought plane tickets and paid for hotel rooms, then were not 
given the tickets they ordered for the game in which Wisconsin beat UCLA, 
21-16. Others complained they had to pay more for tickets than the quoted 
prices.

CANYON COACH WELCH ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Welch, a 12-year veteran football coach at Canyon High in Canyon Country 
best known for his two-year legal battle with the CIF, resigned Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Welch, 48, said he was concerned about his health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've loved what I've done," he said. "I'd like to live long. But I know the 
way I coach that it's all-consuming." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1982, Welch has been the San Fernando Valley area's winningest active 
coach with a record of 120-31-2. The Cowboys won seven league titles and three 
Southern Section championships. Canyon tied a state record with a 46-game 
winning streak from 1983-86. 
</P>
<P>
 But Welch's success has waned in recent years. His teams have not won a league 
title since 1989 and the Cowboys struggled with a 6-4 record last season, 
losing in the first round of the Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, several off-field incidents clouded the program. In two 
automobile accidents last fall, player Mike Pulliam was killed and Chuck Wade, 
coach of the B team, was paralyzed. Welch also got into a shoving match with a 
booster-club member after the Quartz Hill game, and several players left the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, Welch settled a two-year legal battle with the CIF over alleged 
rules violations. The Southern Section had sought to impose a one-year 
suspension on him for allegedly holding an illegal practice in May of 1991. 
Welch took the CIF to court, and finally settled for an undisclosed sum.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keith Smith of Newbury Park High -- the state's all-time leading passer -- has 
been selected the Southern Section Division III player of the year by the 
Amateur Athletic Foundation's panel of sportswriters, it was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior quarterback led the 14-0 Panthers to one of the most successful 
seasons in state history.It was capped by a 22-14 victory over Hawthorne in the 
Division III title game. Smith, 6 feet tall and 180 pounds, completed 66% of 
his attempts for a state record 4,244 yards with 40 touchdowns and 13 
interceptions. He also led Newbury Park in rushing, gaining 774 yards (with a 
7.44-yard average) and scoring 11 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith passed for 9,971 yards to set the all-time state record. A varsity 
starter since his sophomore season, Smith is No. 2 of all time nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Smith, it was announced that running back Wilbert Smith 
(Montclair Prep) and quarterback Zack Hernandez (L.A. Baptist) were named 
players of the year in Divisions VII and X, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith (5-9, 180), a running back who has orally committed to Illinois,

SAN FERNANDO COUNCIL WEIGHS MARGARITO CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando City Council on Monday night considered in secret what steps 
to take in the case of parks director Jess Margarito, a popular former mayor 
who is accused of falsifying official documents and misappropriating more than 
$2,000 in city funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came just hours after Margarito -- also the target of a separate 
criminal investigation by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office -- 
lambasted the council for engaging in what he called a political vendetta 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, meeting in a confidential executive session Monday night, heard a 
report by San Fernando Police Lt. Ernie Halcon, according to Halcon and members 
of the council. The meeting continued late into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, Halcon and an investigator from the district attorney's office 
seized a computer and records from the office of Margarito, whose title is 
director of recreation and community services. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito has been the subject of a criminal investigation by the district 
attorney's office since last April, and has been under scrutiny by the council 
since October. The council inquiry has been limited to administrative matters, 
although Halcon has said he found evidence of criminal wrongdoing as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigations are based on allegations that Margarito falsified work 
cards for convicts assigned by courts to work in the city's parks, and 
submitted bogus work orders that resulted in the payment of $2,250 for tasks 
that were not done. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council directed the city's Police Department to look into the 
charges in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Monday, Margarito told a gathering in front of the San Fernando police 
station that the investigations are politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're doing to us is unjust," he said. "We're not going to be 
intimidated or cowed down by people who don't want change to take place." 
</P>
<P>
 The small rally attracted about 35 residents, many of whom have known 
Margarito since he began his rise from U.S. Census Bureau worker to councilman 
in 1984 and mayor in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito did not contradict specific allegations outlined last week in a 
search warrant affidavit, but said the investigations are an excessive reaction 
to what he believes are merely record-keeping irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 He promised to produce evidence in the coming weeks and called for a public 
City Council meeting to air the allegations. The council has met several times 
in closed session to discuss the case on the grounds that it is a personnel 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe there's been a real aggressive investigation beyond the content of 
the charges against me," he told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had little comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised that he would say that," said City Administrator Mary 
Strenn. "I can't comment on it because it's a personnel matter," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito was joined by his attorney, Arthur Goldberg, who has worked on 
numerous Latino issues, and longtime community activists Ruben Rodriguez and 
Xavier Flores, directors of Pueblo y Salud, a human-services group in San 
Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores has characterized the investigation as a last-ditch effort by the 
city's old white power structure to oust potentially troublesome Latino 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 However, four of the five council members, including the mayor, are Latino, as 
are about 83% of the 23,500 residents of this northeast San Fernando Valley 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that it has extremely racial undertones to it," Flores said earlier 
Monday. "The old power structure would be very, very happy to continue with 
their quasi-apartheid system that has existed in the city of San Fernando for a 
long time, where the few dictate to the majority about where, how and when 
things are going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said the investigations probably are spurred more by personal 
political grudges than any anti-Latino power struggles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honestly, I think the bottom line is that he's a political activist," said 
Goldberg. "He doesn't always do things by the book, he's revitalized the city 
parks department, and all those things make him dangerous politically." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said that Margarito "probably was involved in signing off improperly" 
some of the convicts' time cards, but never acted for personal financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no evidence of kickbacks," Goldberg said. "That to me is an entirely 
different moral issue. This has all the appearances of a political struggle."

PERSISTENT HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM BAKES SOUTHLAND; WEATHER: GLENDALE LED U.S. 
CITIES WITH RECORD HIGHS OF 89 SUNDAY AND 87 MONDAY. BUT NORMAL WINTER RAINFALL 
IS STILL FORECAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A massive high-pressure system brought more sunny skies and record 
temperatures to Southern California on Monday, but forecasters said chances are 
still good for above-average rainfall here this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Top readings in the 70s broke records in Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo and 
Santa Barbara on Monday, and the high of 86 at the Los Angeles Civic Center 
fell just one degree short of the record for the date, set in 1902. Glendale 
led all U.S. cities for two straight days, recording a high temperature of 89 
degrees on Sunday and a mark of 87 degrees on Monday, meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 The overnight low in downtown Los Angeles was 59 degrees, which tied the 
previous record high minimum for the date, established in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
 The balmy weather that started before Christmas has come from a series of 
high-pressure systems that have blocked the usual onshore flow of moist, marine 
air from the Pacific while holding wintry storms at bay, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 One such storm from the Gulf of Alaska had been headed this way for several 
days, and it looked for a while as though there could be at least a few 
sprinkles here by tonight. However, an unusually strong ridge of high pressure 
built over Southern California on Monday, forming a barrier that will keep the 
main body of the storm well to the north, meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm system should bring cloudiness that will keep today's temperatures 
at least 10 degrees cooler than Monday's, but no rain is expected south of the 
San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who thinks it has been drier than usual here lately is right. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service said the total rainfall in Los Angeles during the 
month of December was only 0.78 of an inch, about 1.25 inches less than normal 
for the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said conditions still 
appear to be shaping up for normal -- or above-normal -- rainfall in January 
and February, the months during which Los Angeles usually gets its heaviest 
rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Measurements by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration 
continue to confirm a return of El Nino -- a phenomenon of shifting winds and 
ocean currents that generally brings unusually heavy rainfall to Southern 
California during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon, which prevailed in late 1992 and early 1993 after an 
eight-year hiatus, is thought to have caused last winter's unusually wet 
conditions in California and extreme cold in the Eastern United States.  
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, there is no rain in sight for Southern California.

VANDALS WREAK HAVOC IN SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Freshly returned from winter break, second-grade teacher Janet Hernandez 
arrived early at Erwin Street School on Monday, ready to jump into a brand-new 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she walked into a disaster zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Books, crayons and scissors littered her classroom floor. A tape player was 
broken and a phonograph missing. Even a pile of human feces was left in front 
of a cupboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just devastated," Hernandez said. "It was very hard to take a look 
around and see the wanton vandalism of the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-week vacation, Erwin Street staff members spent the better part of 
Monday mopping up the aftermath of the school's second major break-in within 10 
months. Sometime over the long recess, vandals ransacked three classrooms, 
leaving behind a shambles and teachers and students feeling angry and violated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's traumatizing," school counselor Freya Kay said. "To come back, all ready 
to teach, and then to have your room devastated. For us, it's just like having 
our home broken into." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials said Monday that dozens of other 
campuses throughout the sprawling school system also reported damage incurred 
over the holidays, including some in the San Fernando Valley. In all, spot 
checks by authorities during the vacation uncovered about 125 burglaries and 35 
acts of vandalism districtwide, school police Deputy Chief Larry Hutchens said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Erwin Street, intruders stole a teacher's boom box and damaged computers 
and other electronic equipment. In Hernandez's class, which bore the brunt of 
the vandals' destruction, they pried open locked cupboards, scattered potting 
soil from science kits all over the floor and even pilfered from the class 
penny collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "One little girl said to me as I was walking away from it, 'I just feel like 
crying,' " Hernandez said. "Another little girl said, 'And I came to school so 
happy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "They were visibly shaken," added teacher Tricia Buttrill, whose second- and 
third-grade students saw the clutter and destruction before being moved with 
others to the campus library and auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very unhappy that a place that felt safe to them didn't feel like a 
safe place to be (anymore)." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was an unwelcome repeat of a similar -- but worse -- outbreak of 
vandalism last March. In that case, four classrooms were hit by intruders who 
sprayed graffiti, including a swastika, on the walls, splattered paint and even 
killed a fish in a class aquarium. Officials later determined that three 
current and former students were responsible for the incident, which caused an 
estimated $5,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the earlier incident, school officials said the latest break-in seemed 
more an act of youthful rage and destruction than a calculated desire to make 
off with valuable items. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a lot was taken," said Kaye, the counselor. "It really looks not like 
kids looking to steal anything as much as trying to destroy things." 
</P>
<P>
 The same appeared to hold true at Chase Street School in nearby Panorama City, 
which was also targeted during the holidays, perhaps several times. Principal 
Diana Villafana said vandals broke into a dozen classrooms, leaving them 
temporarily unusable by releasing fire extinguisher foam.

 Business brought Sunny Bhalla to the San Fernando Valley. But since he's been 
here, that business hasn't been booming. 
</P>
<P>
 Bhalla, his wife and their three children left West Los Angeles six months 
ago, moving to an apartment above the Canoga Park restaurant they'd bought. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, their dream of success is still just a dream.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought business would have been better," Bhalla said, sitting at one of 
dozens of empty tables inside his peach-and-white restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bhallas came to California from Bombay six years ago, leaving the family 
welding equipment business. He found work managing a shoe store and his wife, 
Tanvi, worked in restaurants in trendy, expensive West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But owning a business on the Westside didn't seem even remotely possible. And 
a house was out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Property values over there are fantastic," Sunny Bhalla said. "We can't even 
think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 When the opportunity came to buy the Bombay Gate restaurant on Saticoy Street, 
the Bhallas jumped. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our dream," Sunny Bhalla said. 
</P>
<P>
 So the family moved in above the restaurant during the sweltering San Fernando 
Valley summer. That was the first shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weather is good in winter in the Valley. Not in summer," said Tanvi Bhalla. 
"I missed West L.A. in summer. We didn't ever use our fan in West L.A. in 
summertime." 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later came another shock, as the family learned of a serial 
molester attacking Valley children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were kind of scared," Sunny Bhalla said. "Even if (the children) are two 
minutes or five minutes late we would worry." 
</P>
<P>
 Roshni Bhalla, a seventh-grader at Sutter Middle School in Canoga Park leaned 
against a refrigerator in her family's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my old school there are a lot of different people from a lot of different 
countries," she said. "Over here, there are not a lot of people from different 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he moved to the Valley for business, Sunny Bhalla believes his family 
can be happy here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think here in the Valley, more people are family oriented," he said. "In 
West L.A. you never see that. My family will be more safe here, more free 
here." REBECCA BRYANT

SPECIAL REPORT: MOVING TO THE VALLEY; NEWCOMERS ARRIVE ON WAVE OF HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They've come, despite the closing aerospace plants, crime and languishing 
public schools. They've come, despite graffiti, gloomy news reports and streets 
lined with For Sale signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bucking the trend in recession-dogged Los Angeles, people are still moving to 
the San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 And while old-timers complain of the Valley's demise, these newcomers still 
see the promise of a better life here. They've defied the common wisdom and 
come here to buy homes, open businesses, flee from crime and start anew amid 
the Valley's fast-changing ethnic mix. 
</P>
<P>
 And while those leaving the Southland still garner much of the publicity, 
those who are just arriving have something to say as well. 
</P>
<P>
 These pages represent a view of the Valley through the eyes of people who 
arrived during the past year -- what they like and what they don't like about 
their new home, and what they hope to make of its future.

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; LIBRARY GUIDES THOSE 
LOOKING FOR THEIR ROOTS

<P>
 Ever wonder where your family tree is rooted? About great-great-great-Aunt 
Mildred who gave you your middle name? Whether your ancestors were pilgrims, 
princes or pirates? 
</P>
<P>
 A team of sleuths in Burbank is used to these types of inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers at the Southern California Genealogical Society Library 
consider themselves more detectives than librarians.  
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Schultz, who has volunteered at the library for nearly a dozen years, 
became interested in genealogy 15 years ago, after looking through scrapbooks 
of her grandmother and great-grandmother on her mother's side. She also decided 
to explore her father's ancestry after learning that he never knew his 
grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I got going, it kind of took on a life of its own," said Schultz, 58, of 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 She traced both her mother's and father's roots to the 1600s in England and 
Scotland. She also debunked a family myth. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandmother was convinced we were related to Robert E. Lee," she said. "So 
much so she named her son Robert Lee." 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz, a member of the genealogy society, volunteered at the library so she 
could keep in contact with other amateur genealogists. Now she spends one 
evening a week answering phones, indexing books and helping visitors to the 
private library find clues. 
</P>
<P>
 Marva Grove, 60, volunteers once a month. Also an avid genealogist, Grove has 
found soldiers from the Civil War in her family's past. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend doing research informed Grove that Grove's family included three 
Mayflower passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was almost disappointed she found that," Grove said. "I would have liked to 
have found it myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Most library visitors are amateurs like Grove and Schultz and need a little 
guidance. Some expect to walk in the library, open a book and find their 
heritage laid out in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really isn't that easy," Grove said. "It's a lot of detective work." 
</P>
<P>
 Some genealogical gumshoes come up with ideas about their ancestry that 
couldn't possibly be verified, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, someone brought a two-page diagram of their family tree "tracing 
their ancestry from themselves back to Adam. We just laughed hysterically," 
Grove said. "How they decided that, we didn't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz keeps hoping to find some juicy tidbits about her ancestors, but all 
she finds are farming tales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep looking to see if someone was accused of murder or of being a witch. 
Something exciting," she said. "The most I ever found was somebody in my family 
being sued for trespassing or their animals going onto someone else's land." 
</P>
<P>

Truesdale, who coordinates the 50 current volunteers, at (818) 843-7247.

SPECIAL REPORT: MOVING TO THE VALLEY; GLENDALE; RESTAURANT OWNER MADE THE RIGHT

 Her business has yet to turn a profit, but Elizabeth Hokenson says she made 
the right call when she traded in her small-town life in San Luis Obispo County 
to run the Phone Co. restaurant in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say I have a lot of guts," said the Hokenson, 49, who left 
the small town of Harmony -- population 40 -- last year.She came to Glendale 
because her husband, who died in 1991, is buried nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 She bought the Phone Co., located near the Galleria, in November. An immigrant 
from Korea, Hokenson has relatives living and running stores and restaurants in 
Los Angeles' Koreatown. But Hokenson wanted to operate her business in a safer 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glendale has less crimes," said Hokenson, who rents an apartment in Glendale 
with her younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
 She also lauded city officials for their pro-business attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 So far though, Hokenson's business -- although it has maintained many 
customers through the change of ownership -- has yet to turn a profit, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she hopes the restaurant will become a success so that she can set up 
a college scholarship foundation named after her husband, Gustave John 
Hokenson, a research scientist who wanted to open his own school, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't finish his dream, so I want to do it for him," she said. TOMMY LI

SPECIAL REPORT: MOVING TO THE VALLEY; CANOGA PARK; BOLIVIANS' DREAMS CHANGE IN 
NEW HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last July, Enrique Carmona traded one valley for another, moving his family 
nearly 5,000 miles from a small city in the shadow of the Andes Mountains to a 
polyglot suburb sprawled at the foot of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year-old Bolivian brought with him a wife and three children, a degree 
in architecture, and fond dreams -- aspirations he now carries in altered form 
into 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "My point of view has changed, because one leaves one's country with ideas 
that are, at times, illusions," said Carmona, seated in the sparsely furnished 
Canoga Park home owned by his brother, Luis. Nine people live in the one-story 
house at the end of a cul-de-sac that clings tenuously to a tidy suburban 
image. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmona came to the United States legally, allowed in because his family 
includes parents who are naturalized U.S. citizens. With college degrees behind 
them as well, Enrique and his wife, Ruth, left their home city of Cochabamba 
for the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, it was the urban architecture that struck Enrique Carmona 
most profoundly when he arrived in Los Angeles by jet last July. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lamentably, I got here on a cloudy day and I couldn't see the city like I 
imagined it was," he said. "But in the 45 minutes (driving) from the airport, 
what impressed me was it was all city. In my country, traveling 45 minutes, and 
the distance that implies, you would leave the city, go into the country and 
maybe enter another city." 
</P>
<P>
 There were smaller culture shocks as well, like eating the day's big meal in 
the evening instead of the afternoon. Enrique Carmona also learned a new form 
of Spanish -- one loaded with Mexican sayings and words he had never heard. He 
laughed, imitating a Mexican accent and rattling off a favorite Mexican swear 
word. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Latinos, Enrique Carmona worries that gains garnered from life in 
San Fernando Valley come with an equal loss of cultural identity. "In this 
country, they have so many different people and customs, in a certain sense you 
lose your identity and tradition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Life also moves at a quicker pace here, something both Carmonas said they 
like. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things can happen quickly here," Enrique Carmona said. "It's dynamic and 
moves faster. You can make up for lost time here. That's another difference 
from my country." 
</P>
<P>
 "Life in Bolivia is more tranquil, more plain," said Ruth Carmona. "Here in 
San Fernando (Valley), it's a nice life. I like it, probably because my 
personality matches it -- running around, doing things here and there. It's a 
more intense life, like in all of the United States. There's a lot, a lot more 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 For the short term, the Carmonas hope 1994 will be the year in which they 
become fluent in English, a language their children, aged 7 through 15, have 
begun to learn in bilingual public school classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen, quite sadly, people who've lived here for years and years and 
still live terribly," said Enrique Carmona. "They don't know the language. I 
think this small advantage will bring us ahead more quickly. I hope it will 
show people from Bolivia are good, hard workers." GEOFFREY MOHAN

SPECIAL REPORT: MOVING TO THE VALLEY; BURBANK; BUSINESSMAN CALLS THE AREA 
'STRATEGIC'

 In 1982, Angel Dayan fled the Philippines to escape the harsh government and a 
poor economy for a better life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 12 years later he would flee the mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles 
for a better life in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I'd take my chances here," said the 46-year-old accountant, who 
moved his business to Burbank in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime and Metro Rail, Dayan said, drove him from Los Angeles. His clients' 
cars were constantly being broken into and construction of the new rail line 
down Wilshire Boulevard made it difficult for clients to see him.  
</P>
<P>
 He misses the Filipino restaurants and community in his old neighborhood. But 
Burbank, he says, has better parking, less crime and at his storefront office 
on the corner of Angeleno Avenue and San Fernando Road, the rent is half what 
it was in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Burbank is a pretty strategic area," Dayan said. "I think Burbank is 
becoming a business center, getting a spillover from Los Angeles because of the 
riots." 
</P>
<P>
 Dayan said many of his former clients have followed him to his new location. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayan would like to live in Burbank, but the current depressed real estate 
market has made that difficult. He has lived in Van Nuys for the past four 
years, after moving his home from the mid-Wilshire area as well. 
</P>
<P>
 He enjoys the growing ethnic diversity of the Valley, but at the same time 
likes the conservatism he has found in Burbank, even a law that prohibited 
banners for new businesses. That law has been repealed since he opened his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Los Angeles, traffic cops are busy citing traffic violators and enforcing 
those laws every day," Dayan said. "In Burbank, they don't do that, the parking 
enforcement is pretty liberal and you don't have to worry about crime." 
</P>
<P>
 In a few years, after Metro Rail construction is finished, Dayan said he might 
move his business back to the mid-Wilshire area, but he would never move his 
home back over the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get to rest in Los Angeles on the weekends," Dayan said. "It's too 
noisy." ED BOND

SPECIAL REPORT: MOVING TO THE VALLEY; NORTH HOLLYWOOD; HOMELESS MAN SAYS HE HAS

 Drug dealers do not harass Terrell Jones anymore. Police no longer stop and 
question him. And he can wear any color he desires without fear of attracting a 
gang member's wrath. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only thing that worries the 40-year-old Jones since he left the mean 
streets of Los Angeles last year is where he is going to sleep this month. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as he struggles with homelessness by surviving day-by-day at a local 
shelter in North Hollywood, he knows his chances are better in the San Fernando 
Valley than they were back in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have more opportunities out here," said Jones, who has been living at 
the Trudy and Norman Louis Valley Shelter in North Hollywood since November. 
"It's looking a lot better now." 
</P>
<P>
 Such was not the case in April, 1992, when Jones found himself in the middle 
of the Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was not harmed, the then-assembly-line worker said the burning of 
nearby apartment buildings and businesses near Pico and Crenshaw boulevards 
forced him to flee to the safety of a friend's house in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, he watched his neighborhood burn on television and decided it was 
time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just mentally affected," Jones said of the experience. "I decided I 
would move here to the Valley because it was much more of a low-key atmosphere 
than South-Central L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 But moving to a better life in the Valley would not be so easy. Within a few 
months of returning to his home in Los Angeles to finish out his year-long 
lease on his apartment, Jones was laid off from his job at a dyed foods plant. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, he lived on unemployment benefits. When they ran out last July, 
he moved to a girlfriend's Van Nuys apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 He managed to get his own apartment after applying for general relief in 
September, but lost his home two months later because his rent was overdue. 
Evicted and jobless, Jones contacted the North Hollywood shelter and joined the 
ranks of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the hard times, Jones said the move to the Valley was the right one to 
make. Although he has only been here for six months, he said he already feels 
safer, more hopeful and better about himself than he did in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a much better atmosphere out here," he said from the shelter, where he 
lives in one of 80 one-bedroom apartment units. "There's not as much stress and 
strain and pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Just getting dressed for the day is no longer a game of life and death, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can wear any color you want without worrying that certain things are 
gonna happen from gang members," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And since drug dealers no longer sell drugs on every corner of his 
neighborhood, as they did in Los Angeles, Jones said he can walk freely down 
the streets without fear of being approached by pushers or police. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I would go to the store, the police would take it for granted that I was 
buying some drugs," Jones said. "They would flash the lights on you. But by me 
not being into drugs, I would always be able to go free." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Jones said, he likes the police in the Valley better than their city 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know how to deal with the citizens a lot better," he said, recalling a 
domestic dispute he witnessed at his old Van Nuys apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Jones said, he is hopeful that the Valley will offer him a second 
chance. JEFF SCHNAUFER

SPECIAL REPORT: MOVING TO THE VALLEY; TARZANA; A TOUGH NEW LIFE FOR BULGARIAN 
EMIGRE

 1993 will be remembered by Sveta Ivanova as the year in which her 
Hollywood-induced dream of life in Los Angeles was traded in for the stark 
reality of starting anew in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is hard here," the 50-year-old native of Bulgaria said in her newly 
learned English, still laden with a thick accent. "It's not like in the 
movies." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the pressures of assimilating into such a different culture and 
working long hours as a nanny for little pay did not quite match her vision of 
the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said, it seems easy compared to the poverty and oppression that 
ultimately drove her from her homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life in Bulgaria . . . that is terrible," she said, recounting food and fuel 
shortages in the dead of winter and the firm hand of Communist rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanova, who lives with her brother and his family in Tarzana, left her 
husband, two daughters and a grandchild behind when she came to the United 
States a year ago in search of a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so hard for me to leave," said the sturdy woman with blond hair and a 
quick smile. "I am not young." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of Ivanova's family has been unable to get visas for travel to the 
United States. And although she writes and calls frequently and sends money to 
Bulgaria, she said their absence is felt daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids I take care of here are my family now," she said. "They are all I 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 And although the vastness of Los Angeles and the well-stocked store shelves 
have met with her vision of America, her experience in her first year here has 
led to a modest goal for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to speak English better," she said, after several instances of waving 
her hands in frustration at not being able to describe some of her feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Ivanova has been studying English at night at Canoga Park High 
School and hopes her improved language skills will lead to a better job. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that although many Americans are friendly on the surface, it seems 
more difficult to get to know people here than in a European city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There people walk on the street all day and in the evening in Bulgaria -- 
that's the European style," she said. "I (seldom see) people doing that here, 
they just sit in their cars and drive." SCOTT GLOVER

SPECIAL REPORT: MOVING TO THE VALLEY; RESEDA; BAY AREA TRANSPLANT UNEASY IN NEW 
HOME

<P>
 There's something a little off about this place, something not quite right, 
although Nora Bedrossian can't quite put her finger on it. 
</P>
<P>
 She searches for words while absent-mindedly stirring a large vat of olives 
bobbing in yellow oil, her cigarette poised in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I notice lots of teen-agers who don't look right," said the 38-year-old, who 
moved from San Francisco and opened a shop in Reseda. "They're not dressed 
right, they don't act right. It worries me. They stand right out here on the 
corner without doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
 For Bedrossian, the desultory teen-agers in baggy clothes are a visible symbol 
of broader social ills in the San Fernando Valley, and she seizes on them to 
help explain her vague sense of unease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doesn't everyone have something to do?" she asked. "It's very bad, this not 
having anything to do -- it means something." 
</P>
<P>
 Bedrossian, her husband and their 5-year-old son are Christians of Armenian 
descent who fled Iran in 1989. They moved from the Bay Area to Canoga Park two 
months ago, and Nora Bedrossian has opened a small international food market on 
Vanowen Street. Her husband works in the business and is considering opening 
one of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The small shop, with its bins of bulgur wheat and baskets of bananas, is doing 
brisk business, drawing many of its customers from Latino families who walk to 
the store from nearby neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Between working 12-hour days and trying to get settled, Bedrossian has had 
little time to reflect on her new environment. But she has already concluded 
that she likes it less than her former home in Millbrae, located outside San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley doesn't make sense to me," she said. "The street I live on is 
nice, but on the next street there are so many crazy people and junk cars in 
the yards. I haven't been here for long, but it doesn't feel like the right 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 Her judgment is, in part, reflective of her general impressions of the United 
States -- a land where the threat of crime is always lurking, money is 
everyone's foremost concern and children grow up in loose-knit families whose 
members look out for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I see it, the families here are not together, they're apart," she 
said. "Each lives and cares and thinks individually, only for themselves. That 
damages the family and it damages the country."  
</P>
<P>
 The ethnic mix in the Valley "is good," she said. "But only if everyone cares 
for each other and cares for their youngsters." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bedrossians came to the San Fernando Valley because so many of their 
friends and family members from Iran have settled here. The couple want their 
son to grow up in the presence of his extended family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want him to learn how to live with others, to share and care," she said. 
Living near her sister- and mother-in-law means that family members can look 
after each other's children and that the children can be with their cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bedrossian seems unconvinced that the Valley is a good place to raise a 
child. She wishes she saw more police. And she pays to send her son to a 
private Armenian school out of distrust for the public school system. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I talk about Millbrae, I can say there are nice families, good kids, good 
public schools, and it's safe to walk around at 10 p.m.," she said. "Here, I 
don't know. It's too early to say. But I see it's dusty, it's rusty. I see 
these houses, and I think that person was born in that house and is now 40 and 
hasn't made any changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't seem to care about making changes here." JILL LEOVY

BOY, 3, RESCUED FROM HOUSE FIRE DIES IN HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 3-year-old boy who was found unconscious last week in a burning house that 
was apparently set afire by a Christmas tree died Monday at Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center, a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Johnson died a few minutes before noon in the hospital's pediatric 
intensive care unit, where he was being treated for smoke inhalation, a nursing 
supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 An official cause of death, however, had not been determined, according to a 
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy had been in the hospital since Thursday, when firefighters found him 
in the closet of his Sylmar home, unconscious and not breathing. Firefighters 
performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the boy in front of the burning 
house until he was transported to Olive View Medical Center and then flown by 
helicopter to the Northridge hospital, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's mother, Shawn Johnson, 27, and his brother, Denton, 4, also suffered 
burns and smoke inhalation and were taken to Holy Cross Medical Center. The 
mother remains hospitalized for burns on her head, hands and back. Denton has 
been released. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they believe the fire started when Denton began playing 
with a candle near the family tree. The boys' mother was able to pull Denton 
from the burning house but could not get back in to save Lance, fire officials 
said.

BANK ROBBER RECEIVES 30-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE; CRIME: JAMES MCGRATH STOLE NEARLY 
$1 MILLION IN NINE HEISTS. HIS MENTAL CONDITION PROMPTS THE JUDGE TO DECLINE A 
MORE SEVERE PENALTY. 
</P>

<P>
 A convicted bank robber who was sentenced to 30 years in prison on Monday told 
a federal judge that he stole nearly $1 million from nine San Fernando Valley 
banks to warn the public of a coming thermonuclear attack by the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting a defense that God told him to rob banks, a federal jury convicted 
James Ambrose McGrath in October on 18 counts of armed robbery and weapons 
violations in connection with a string of robberies that included the biggest 
bank heist in Los Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath, 49, is the author of a 300-page document about co-defendant Gilbert 
David Michaels' life and a conspiracy involving banks and a candy maker who 
allegedly worked to destroy Michaels' fudge-making business. 
</P>
<P>
 During his hearing Monday, McGrath told U.S. District Court Judge Harry L. 
Hupp that his primary motive for committing the robberies was "to warn the 
United States that Japan is planning a sneak thermonuclear attack against us." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Hupp sentenced McGrath to 30 years in prison, frustrating 
prosecutors who had asked the judge to impose a 165-year sentence on the 
nine-time bank robber. Prosecutors had hoped McGrath would be sentenced to 
consecutive terms as opposed to the concurrent terms that Hupp handed down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We disagree with the sentence," Assistant U.S. Atty. Christopher Tayback 
said. "The government's position is that (consecutive terms are) what the law 
requires." 
</P>
<P>
 Tayback said he is uncertain whether he will appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hupp told prosecutors he would not impose a sentence that would equate to life 
in prison without the possibility of parole because of McGrath's mental 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike many bank robbers who are robbing to build up their stash of cash . . 
. this bank robber was operating under a heavy mental state," Hupp said. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath's attorney, John D. Robertson of Los Angeles, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think clearly life without possibility of parole would have been unjust," 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI arrested McGrath and Michaels in March, 1992, following the robbery of 
a Home Savings of America branch in Woodland Hills. Authorities discovered a 
cache of 119 guns and more than 27,000 rounds of ammunition during a search of 
a lavish West Hills home the two men shared. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors portrayed McGrath as a meticulous thief who used disguises and a 
series of getaway cars to avoid capture. They also alleged that he robbed for 
money that he spent to pay rent on the West Hills home as well as buy cars and 
motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath's defense attorney, however, had urged jurors to find his client 
insane, arguing that he suffers from delusions of devils and fallen angels. He 
said McGrath has a severe mental defect that prevented him from realizing the 
moral wrongfulness of his acts. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath testified during his trial that God told him to rob the banks and even 
advised him to use gloves and disguises. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lord specifically commanded me to rob the banks, so that's what I did," 
McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 A March 8 trial date has been set for co-defendant Michaels, who recently was 
found competent to stand trial for the same string of robberies. Among the 
robberies that McGrath and Michaels were charged with was one in Tarzana that 
netted $430,000, the most ever taken in a Los Angeles bank robbery.

2,500 POLICE OFFICERS GATHER AT FUNERAL SERVICES FOR GANZ; SLAYING: GOVERNOR, 
MANHATTAN BEACH CHIEF PAY TRIBUTE TO POLICEMAN SHOT BY MOTORIST. HE IS 
REMEMBERED FOR DEVOTION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.

<P>
 More than 2,500 law enforcement officers from Los Angeles and surrounding 
communities turned out Monday to honor slain Manhattan Beach Police Officer 
Martin L. Ganz, the first officer to be gunned down in the quiet seaside 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The uniformed officers, Gov. Pete Wilson and Manhattan Beach Police Chief Ted 
Mertens joined Ganz's family and hundreds of grieving friends to remember Ganz 
as a devoted police officer who loved to work with children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the true meaning of Martin's commitment can be found in the faces 
of children throughout this community and others whose lives he touched," 
Mertens said of Ganz, who became a police officer in Manhattan Beach in 1989. 
"Martin was truly a man of principles, values and ideals who loved his job." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson pledged that law enforcement and government officials will "not rest 
until the thug that took his life is brought to justice." 
</P>
<P>
 "Martin has left a legacy to us," Wilson said. "He has entrusted us with a 
dream of a safe and decent California. It is our responsibility to honor his 
memory and to accept that trust and complete the job for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz, 29, died the night of Dec. 27 after he was gunned down by a motorist he 
had pulled over outside the Manhattan Village shopping mall. No arrests have 
been made, and police have yet to come up with a motive for the shooting. The 
shooting was witnessed by Ganz's 13-year-old nephew, who had accompanied the 
officer on routine patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have released a sketch of a suspect, described as an Asian man in his 
late 20s or early 30s with a medium build. Investigators are continuing to 
search for the drivers of two vehicles filmed by a nearby bank camera who may 
have witnessed the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tearful eulogy to her brother, Janet Chase recalled how Ganz always had 
dreamed of becoming a police officer. She said the day he graduated from the 
police academy and the day he got a job with the Manhattan Beach Police 
Department were "two of the best days of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I saw him was at our family Christmas party," Chase said. "He 
had to leave the party early because he had to go to work. He was so happy. 
Before he left, he gave me a big bear hug and said, 'Goodby, Janet. I love 
you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After the 90-minute service, broadcast on speakers and television sets to an 
overflow crowd gathered in the parking lot and in an adjacent auditorium of 
American Martyrs Church in Manhattan Beach, hundreds of law enforcement 
officers in squad cars and on motorcycles led the mile-long funeral procession 
to Inglewood Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 For police officers from Los Angeles to San Diego, Ganz's death seemed to 
underscore the increasingly violent nature of the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sign of the times," said Officer Steve Gentry of the Inglewood Police 
Department. "You've got kids growing up in a world where people just don't flat 
out care anymore. There's no one to teach them respect for police officers. 
There's no respect for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Tom Dorsey of the Torrance Police Department added: "More people have 
guns now and are more willing to use them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz was the third officer killed in Southern California in the last five 
weeks. Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins was fatally shot by a 
fellow officer in an informal police training session on Christmas Day. Oxnard 
Police Detective James E. O'Brien was shot to death Dec. 2 while trying to 
apprehend a man who had shot up an Oxnard unemployment office, killing three 
and wounding four. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few feet from Ganz's cemetery plot lay another slain policeman, Compton 
Officer Kevin Burrell, who was shot to death along with his partner, James 
McDonald, last March after they had stopped two suspects in a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who paid tribute to Ganz on Monday were several Manhattan Beach 
elementary school students enrolled in anti-drug abuse classes taught by the 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the nicest people I've ever known," said 12-year-old Kelly 
Sullivan. "He loved everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Delmonico, one of Ganz's fellow officers in Manhattan Beach, paid 
tribute to him with this poem: 
</P>
<P>
 I saw a policeman cry today,  
</P>
<P>
 a fellow officer had passed away.  
</P>
<P>
 So full of life,  
</P>
<P>
 So free and wild,  
</P>
<P>
 He'd always stoop to help a child.  
</P>
<P>
 He did his job, he did his best.  
</P>
<P>
 He was equal to the test.  
</P>
<P>
 I'll never know the reason why,  
</P>
<P>
 Officer Ganz had to die.  
</P>
<P>
 But there is one thing that I am sure,  
</P>
<P>
 I will stand at heaven's door,  
</P>
<P>
 And when that door is open wide  
</P>
<P>
 there'll be Marty by my side.  
</P>
<P>
 I saw a policeman cry today,  
</P>
<P>
 My friend Marty passed away.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: EVIDENCE IN ESPIONAGE 
CASE RULED INADMISSIBLE; COURTS: JUDGE SAID COMPUTER TAPES FOUND IN LOCKER OF 
MAN ACCUSED OF COMPUTER-HACKING CRIMES WERE ILLEGALLY OBTAINED.

<P>
 Key evidence in an espionage case against a former North Hollywood man accused 
of several computer hacking crimes was illegally obtained, a federal judge 
ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte in San Jose said computer tapes found in a 
storage locker rented by Kevin Lee Poulsen should not have been examined by 
prosecutors without a search warrant and cannot be used as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Whyte had ruled the tapes admissible last month but changed his mind, saying 
he had overlooked evidence that should have put a police officer on notice of 
Poulsen's privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to illegal possession of classified government secrets, Poulsen 
faces 13 other charges, including eavesdropping on telephone conversations, and 
tapping into Pacific Bell's computer and an unclassified military computer 
network. He could be sentenced to 85 years in prison if convicted of all 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Paul Meltzer of Santa Cruz, said the sole evidence of the 
espionage charge is contained on one of the storage locker tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meltzer said a government analyst found that the tape contained a 1987 order, 
classified secret, concerning a military exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Meltzer said Poulsen maintains that he would not have knowingly possessed 
military secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Poulsen also faces a trial in Los Angeles on charges that he used his computer 
skills to defraud a radio station during a Porsche automobile giveaway contest 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer said Poulsen, who has been in jail since 1991, has served enough 
time to be eligible for immediate release even if convicted of all the other 
charges in the San Jose case. His trial is scheduled to start Jan. 14. 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert Crowe could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Poulsen, who lived in Menlo Park at the time of his arrest in the San Jose 
case, worked in the mid-1980s as a consultant testing Pentagon computer 
security. He was arrested in 1988 on some of the hacking charges, disappeared 
and was picked up in April, 1991, after a tip prompted by a television show.

2 SISTERS TORMENTED BY THE UNKNOWN FOLLOWING FAMILY'S DISAPPEARANCE; MISSING: 
KATHLEEN AND CHRISTINA HARRISON STILL HOPE SOMEONE WILL FIND THE PLANE CARRYING 
THEIR PARENTS AND SIBLING FROM UTAH ON JULY 25. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Months after the disappearance of their parents and sister, Kathleen and 
Christina Harrison still alternate between hoping for a miracle and grieving 
over a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what not knowing does, the Thousand Oaks sisters said. The mystery 
torments. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen, 24, and Christina, 25, have been left wondering since July 25 when 
the single-engine plane piloted by their father, Reed Harrison, failed to 
arrive at Camarillo Airport as scheduled from Utah. Their mother, Judy, and 
18-year-old sister, Julie, were aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had a funeral service; there aren't graves to go visit," Christina 
said during a recent interview in the family's North Ranch home. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not even anything to tell us they crashed; nothing has told us 
they're not alive," said Kathleen, pausing to add, "Except they're not here. 
It's like they vanished." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite more than two weeks of searching in four states by the Civil Air 
Patrol, no sign of the aircraft was ever found. But the sisters could not stop 
looking even after authorities halted the official hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident we will never entirely give up until we find them," said 
Kathleen, who works for an insurance brokerage firm in the Westlake area of 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pilots keep in contact with the sisters and continue to look for wreckage 
from the plane when they fly over the area between Camarillo and Roosevelt, 
Utah, Kathleen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters said they hope that other fliers will similarly keep a lookout for 
the brown and beige Beechcraft Bonanza plane. They are now trying to arrange an 
airing of their story on the popular syndicated television show "Unsolved 
Mysteries," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't have any closure until we know what happened, and we don't know much 
more today than we did on the 25th of July," said Christina, a law student at 
the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. "The only thing we know for sure is 
they left." 
</P>
<P>
 "And they never came home," Kathleen added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harrison plane disappeared from radar screens after passing over a 
mountainous area near Price, Utah, about 60 miles southwest of Roosevelt, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few months ago, Kathleen said she satisfied her curiosity about the 
area by driving around there with Christina and scanning the landscape from the 
ridge tops. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, we thought, 'Why can't they find them?' " Kathleen said. 
"Then we did some searching of our own, and it's so dense and so rugged. You 
understand once you go there." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, they sent informational flyers to hunting license offices in Utah, 
hoping outdoorsmen would remember to look. But hunting season came and went 
without a word, Christina said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really thought someone would find them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks after the plane's disappearance, friends and family rallied 
around Kathleen and Christina. The sisters also received cards and letters from 
strangers who wrote that Reed, Judy or Julie had touched their lives, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An 80-year-old woman wrote that Reed, an attorney and former Thousand Oaks 
planning commissioner, had been checking up on her regularly since the recent 
death of her husband. Judy, a counselor at El Camino Real High School in 
Woodland Hills, had brought her meals, the woman wrote to the sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Julie, who was last year's senior class president at Westlake High 
School, helped hand out leaflets seeking information about the missing family, 
the sisters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's comforting to know there are so many people out there who care," 
Christina said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters called press conferences to keep the item in the news and handed 
out "missing" flyers to hikers in desert and mountain areas of southern Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Their spirits rose and fell as the days passed. At one point, they got word 
that the plane had been found with no survivors. It turned out to be a 
different crash, which had occurred nine years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the search was called off after volunteer Civil Air Patrol pilots 
looked for 18 days without finding a clue. The sisters thought that it was too 
soon to stop. They feared the worst: that their family had survived a crash, 
but would die waiting for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if we find them and they had made a camp and they starved to death?" 
Kathleen said, fighting back tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "The not knowing is horrible," Christina said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the U. S. Air Force calls off a Civil Air Patrol search without results, 
it's one of the hardest messages to deliver to a family, said Pat Morley, a 
Woodland Hills resident who helped look for the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's even harder than saying, 'We found them but they're not alive,' 
" Morley said, "because it still leaves the family up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed Harrison did not file a flight plan detailing the route he would take 
home that day, said retired U. S. Army Lt. Col. Bob Fowler, a Civil Air Patrol 
spokesman. That is not unusual, but it made the search more difficult, Fowler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer patrols searched longer for the Harrisons than is typical 
because Reed, an Army veteran of Vietnam, was well-trained in survival skills, 
Morley said. As days and weeks passed, however, hopefulness turned to despair. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he were in a conscious state and able to survive even a few days, I'm sure 
he would have used smoke, a mirror, anything to show us evidence there is life 
here," Morley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force, not the volunteer fliers with the Civil Air Patrol, decides 
when to call off the search, Fowler said. After 18 days, the odds are against 
finding survivors, he concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "The odds after 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours diminish as it goes," Fowler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen and Christina said they know the probability of what happened but 
can't resist hoping. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe in miracles," Kathleen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll always want to bring them home, but we're realistic about what probably 
happened," Christina said. "We just don't want people to forget." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing the truth would help the sisters finally close the door on the past, 
Christina said. But it wouldn't end the pain, Kathleen added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're waiting for this to be over, but it's never going to be over," Kathleen 
said. "We've lost our family."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WIFE WHO TRIED TO HELP INMATE ESCAPE IS 
ARRESTED; CRIME: BRENDA PAGE ALTERED HER IDENTIFICATION AND PLANNED TO GIVE 
HUSBAND A SET OF MEN'S CLOTHES. IT IS THE FIRST SUCH ATTEMPT AT THE FACILITY.

 A woman was arrested after bungling an attempt to help her inmate husband 
escape from the state prison here, the first such incident at the 11-month-old 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Page, 30, was arrested Sunday at the California State Prison Los 
Angeles County.She was being held at the Sybil Brand Institute for Women in 
East Los Angeles in lieu of $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Page used an altered identification to be admitted to visit her husband, whose 
name prison officials would not release, said prison spokesman Kenn I. Hicks. 
On questioning, the Long Beach resident also admitted wearing men's clothing 
under her own clothes, which she intended to give to her husband so he could 
somehow escape. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, Hicks said, put a picture of herself on an identification card 
bearing the name of a relative. Both Page and her relative were approved 
visitors to Page's husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wanted to come in as someone else so she could . . . possibly try to help 
her husband escape and we'd be looking for someone else instead of her," Hicks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison guards, Hicks said, thought something was wrong with the identification 
at the time Page was being processed to visit her husband, who is being held in 
maximum security. Nonetheless, she was allowed to visit her husband since the 
name she provided was that of an approved visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the visit, Hicks said Page was questioned and admitted to 
altering the identification, wearing the men's clothing under her own and 
planning to help her husband escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks said Page never gave the clothing to her husband, who may also face 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison, which houses about 4,000 inmates, allows visitors Thursdays 
through Sundays. An average of 1,300 people visit the inmates each week.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PLAN FOR REMOTE OFF-ROAD PARK ANGERS RACERS; 
RECREATION: SUPERVISOR ANTONOVICH BACKS PROPOSAL FOR FACILITY NEAR KERN COUNTY. 
RESIDENTS IN SANTA CLARITA VALLEY CANYONS ARE RELIEVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Thousands of off-road vehicle enthusiasts may finally get a place to race -- 
but it could mean having to haul their bikes and buggies to the outermost 
reaches of Los Angeles County, just five miles short of the Kern County line. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowing to unrelenting political pressure and a new staff report, County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich has shifted his crucial support for a large off-road 
park to the most remote of 57 locations considered by the county: the Hungry 
Valley off-road facility run by the state in Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich's proposal to build a $6-million facility in a portion of Hungry 
Valley known as Quail Canyon -- about an hour's drive north of the San Fernando 
Valley -- infuriated off-road enthusiasts, who had counted on him to support a 
park closer to Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hell will freeze over before I let this happen," said Ed Waldheim, president 
of the California Off-Road Vehicle Assn., which represents more than 5,000 
enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 But it came as a partial relief to residents of Baker and Hume canyons in the 
Santa Clarita Valley, who had vigorously opposed development of the off-road 
park there. Residents were still worried, however, because Antonovich's 
proposal also calls for the county to develop a much smaller, trails-only park 
closer to the city, and Hume Canyon is on the list of possible locations. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials also are considering three areas near Castaic and a site they 
formerly dropped from consideration called Bee Canyon off Soledad Canyon Road 
in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a better idea all around to put it in Hungry Valley," said Susan 
Kachelek, a Baker Canyon resident. "But I'm still very concerned that Hume is 
being considered at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to Antonovich's proposal, the Baker and Hume canyon property had topped 
the list of possible sites for the park, which would have included at least two 
motocross tracks, a flat track, caretaker's facilities, a bicycle motocross 
facility, storage space, wash racks for vehicles, a pro shop, training areas 
and trails.  
</P>
<P>
 But Antonovich said Monday that developing the larger park in the Hume-Baker 
property faces "considerable hurdles," including local opposition, high 
acquisition costs and potential legal challenges.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hungry Valley is relatively free of these types of obstacles, and is 
therefore the best alternative," Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 537-acre Hume-Baker property is owned by Watt Industries, a longtime 
Antonovich campaign contributor, which would make about $10 million on the sale 
if the land were sold to the county for the off-road park. 
</P>
<P>
 Don MacAdam, a spokesman for the company, pointed out that the property is 
already heavily used by off-road enthusiasts and said supporters of the closer 
park regard Antonovich's proposal to shift it to the far northern county as "a 
double-cross" that the supervisor will ultimately lose. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials may raise a few obstacles of their own at meetings with county 
representatives this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles should be more active in finding an alternative site," said Jerry 
Johnson, deputy director of the off-road vehicle division of the state 
Department of Parks and Recreation. "Hungry Valley may not meet the need for an 
urban riding area."  
</P>
<P>
 The county has spent 11 years and about $750,000 trying to find a site for the 
proposed off-road park, said Jim Park, head of planning for the county parks 
department. In 1988, for instance, opposition to a site in Whitney Canyon by 
the Disney Co. and the city of Santa Clarita forced the county to shelve that 
proposal after spending tens of thousands of dollars on a master plan.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've had opposition from environmentalists, residents and corporations," 
said Peter Whittingham, Antonovich's parks deputy. "An off-road park isn't 
quite in the landfill category, but it's getting up there in terms of potential 
opposition."

IN MORTAL KOMBAT FOR VIDEO GAME CROWN; ENTERTAINMENT: NINTENDO OFFICIALS ARE 
LIKELY TO FIND OUT NEXT WEEK THAT HOLIDAY SALES HAVE GIVEN THE TITLE TO RIVAL 
SEGA. 
</P>

 "I'm in the second dungeon of (The Legend of Zelda) Links Awakening," says a 
young man putting a call into the game counseling center at Nintendo's U.S. 
headquarters here. "I've just had the dog eat the flowers so I could get in the 
dungeon. But I've used up my keys, so I can't get in the next one." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kristensen, one of 300 game counselors spending the week frantically 
trying to respond to the post-Christmas rush of questions from new customers, 
taps into his computer and comes up with this advice: "You have to beat the 
skeletons to get another key. Stab them from behind. Get behind him and be 
quick." 
</P>
<P>
 As people across America try their hand at outsmarting the latest electronic 
demons given to them for the holidays, Nintendo has just completed "Hell Week." 
The company may have answered as many as 200,000 customer calls in the week 
between Christmas and New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 But next week may be another hell week for Nintendo, for a different reason: 
Executives here are anxiously awaiting the final release of holiday sales 
numbers -- and things aren't expected to look very good. This past holiday 
season is likely to be remembered as the one when rival Sega Entertainment 
overtook Nintendo as the king of the video game business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sega is dominating the business . . . with a more hip image," says Lee Isgur, 
analyst at Volpe Welty & Co. He expects Sega to show sales to customers of as 
many as 6 million units of its 16-bit Genesis machine in 1993, compared to 5 
million to 5.5 million of Nintendo's equivalent machine. Isgur and other 
analysts suggest Nintendo's share of machines and software cartridges for the 
16-bit market has slid from 55% at the beginning of 1993 to about 45% today -- 
making Sega the consensus choice to emerge as market leader this year. "If I 
were Nintendo, I would be worried." 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo still hopes to show it has defended its overall market share crown 
for 1993. The company's portable game machine, Game Boy, outsold Sega's 
portable. And Nintendo still has strong sales of the slower 8-bit game 
machines. Sega has no equivalent machine. 
</P>
<P>
 But video game sales are driven by the fast machines, and here Nintendo's 
setback could have long-term consequences. Fewer game console sales today mean 
loss of momentum and fewer future sales of the far more profitable cartridge 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 One particularly painful blow was inflicted when Mortal Kombat, a top-selling 
street-fighting game released in September, became an overwhelming favorite on 
the Sega machine. Nintendo's version cut out a final scene that shows the 
victor tearing his victim's heart out. Sega's version, which left the scene in, 
became a must-have among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo is hopeful that its decision to cut violence from its games, while 
painful in the short term, will win over parents and improve its market 
position over the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the focus groups, Nintendo kids are good kids," says Perrin 
Kaplan, a spokeswoman for Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sega kids are irreverent. They have an attitude," she says, calling 
Nintendo's way the "Disney approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't count on it. One of the most pressing questions on Nintendo's hot line 
comes from kids who want to know the "blood code" for Mortal Kombat. There are 
rumors circulating that by punching in a secret code, the bloody last scene 
will magically reappear. The kids are invariably disappointed to discover there 
is no such code. 
</P>
<P>
 In a computer discussion group over the Internet network recently, Nintendo 
fans suggested a boycott and letter-writing campaign to protest Nintendo's 
censorship of its games. 
</P>
<P>
 The full scale of Sega's rout of Nintendo is still unclear. Paul Rioux, 
executive vice president at Sega of America, says there was a last-minute spurt 
in sales of its CD-ROM attachment to its Genesis machine, which allows 
inclusion of real film footage in games. Rioux says there are now close to 1 
million Sega CD-ROM machines in homes, a critical number because most software 
developers don't want to develop games for a new system until there are at 
least that many machines in use. 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo has no comparable product to show and is asking impatient Nintendo 
fans who call in on the hot line to wait until Nintendo has its own, more 
powerful product available toward the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo's one consolation has been its strength in the portable game market. 
But even here, Sega has been making strong inroads, selling 2 million of its 
more elegant color machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nintendo may sell twice as many, it doesn't earn much more in dollar 
sales, because its portables are far cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't cry for Nintendo. With Sega, it continues to dominate a video game 
market that already accounts for a quarter of all toys sold and is growing at 
10% to 15% a year, more than double the growth of the overall toy industry, 
according to Ed Roth, vice president for toy services at NPD Group, a marketing 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 According to some market reports, half of all U.S. homes now own either a 
Nintendo or Sega game system. Powerful new video machines such as Atari's 
Jaguar and one from start-up 3DO have captured media attention, but they've 
hardly put a dent in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And a day at Nintendo's game counseling center shows that while Nintendo may 
be losing market share, it still has a large and loyal following. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 a.m., a woman calls, asking for a tip that will help her husband master a 
video game so he will finally come to bed. A fishing crew off the coast of 
Alaska uses their radio phone to put in an urgent call for help on a new game. 
A mother locks herself in a laundry room to get some quiet away from her kids 
while she dials for help. 
</P>
<P>
 During "Hell Week," game counselors put in long hours answering as many as 250 
calls a day. But most seem to enjoy the work, and that helps maintain 
Nintendo's image for good customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporting long hair, jeans and sneakers and with their leather jackets thrown 
over the backs of their chairs, game counselors play the latest Nintendo video 
games while answering caller questions through their headsets. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvin Forrest, 22, has been at the job for three years and still can't 
believe his luck. He was manager at a fast-food restaurant three years ago when 
he entered a Nintendo video game contest. He made it to the finals, where his 
opponent was a 7-year-old video game whiz. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got the trip to Disneyland in Florida," Forrest said, chuckling. "I got 
this job." 
</P>
<P>
 He recently traveled to India, where he lived until age 6, to meet the family 
of a woman his parents have arranged for him to marry. "When they asked me what 
I do, they couldn't believe I get paid to play video games all day." 
</P>
<P>
 The job isn't all fun. Mark Coates, a veteran game counselor, says there is an 
art to satisfying the caller's curiosity without ruining the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids want to get through the game as fast as possible. We try to just give 
them tips," says Coates. "Otherwise they don't get the full value of the game. 
Where you should get 100 hours of playing time you might only get half an 
hour." Parents have complained in the past that their children master the games 
too quickly, squandering a $50 investment. The Video Game Market 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nintendo still leads the U.S. video game market, Sega has gained 
substantial market share and now leads Nintendo in the critical 16-bit 
segments. Some analysts project Sega will capture the overall game makret lead 
in 1994. 1991 Share

NLRB ACCUSES THRIFTY OF LABOR LAW VIOLATIONS; WORKERS: COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT 
THE DRUGSTORE CHAIN ILLEGALLY IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM TO FORCE PHARMACISTS INTO 
MANAGEMENT POSITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thrifty Drug Stores violated federal labor law by cutting working hours and 
otherwise punishing union pharmacists who refused to accept newly created 
management jobs, the National Labor Relations Board alleged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges, which are being contested by Thrifty, stemmed from complaints 
filed by the three Southern California union locals representing pharmacists at 
the chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute was triggered by Thrifty's decision last fall to put managers -- 
who are not covered by the company's contract with the United Food and 
Commercial Workers union -- in charge of pharmacy operations at many of its 
nearly 500 stores in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrifty, with more drugstores in the state than any other retailer, employs 
1,200 full- and part-time pharmacists, more than 1,000 of whom are union 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 In complaints to the labor board, union officials contended that Thrifty 
retaliated against union pharmacists who turned down the company's offers to 
become pharmacy managers by eliminating their overtime hours. In addition, the 
union officials said, some union pharmacists who had worked at particular 
stores for years were forced to start shuttling between two or three stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a two-month investigation, the NLRB decided to charge the company. A 
complaint filed by the agency accused the company of "unilaterally 
implementing" the pharmacy manager program, leading to loss of overtime and 
"the imposition of more onerous work assignments." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Andrea Zinder, research director for Local 770 of the UFCW: "We're 
pleased that the NLRB has recognized that Thrifty is abusing these pharmacists 
and has coerced them in violation of their rights" to leave the union. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chris Bement, a Thrifty executive vice president, said Monday that he was 
"very confident" the case will be dismissed if the firm gets a fair hearing 
before an administrative law judge April 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The union contract, Bement said, gives the chain the right to install pharmacy 
managers, eliminate overtime hours and transfer employees. He denied that any 
action was taken to punish pharmacists who rejected job offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are all those poor employees who are being abused?" Bement asked. "We 
have pharmacists standing in line for those pharmacy manager positions." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bement, Thrifty pharmacy managers draw base salaries of about 
$80,000 to $95,000 and can earn as much as $15,000 more in bonuses if their 
operations meet profit goals. Union pharmacists, he said, work up to 45 hours a 
week and earn close to $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Union pharmacists may not want to become managers because in those roles they 
have to work longer hours without getting overtime pay, and lose protection of 
their union contract and union work rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The union complaints have come mainly from Los Angeles County, where roughly 
150 union pharmacists are working under a three-year contract that expires in 
July, 1995, Bement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive said Thrifty created the pharmacy manager jobs to compete more 
effectively against other drugstore chains.  
</P>
<P>
 Bement contends that the union locals object to the plan because they fear 
losing members and union dues. 
</P>
<P>
 Zinder countered that the pharmacists "do not want to leave the union, but 
they are being coerced into it." The union's complaints, she said, are not 
"just a numbers game. It's a matter of protecting the people we represent."

GREAT WESTERN TO LAY OFF MOST HOMEFED EMPLOYEES; BANKING: COMPANY MAY RELEASE 
TWO-THIRDS OF PAYROLL IT INHERITED WHEN IT ACQUIRED FAILED THRIFT. IT IS ALSO 
CLOSING 70 BRANCH OFFICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Great Western Bank said Monday that it may lay off as many as two thirds of 
the 1,700 new employees inherited when it acquired the failed Homefed Bank from 
the federal government last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western, the nation's second-largest thrift, also said it has closed 13 
branches and will close another 57 by the end of next month. Most of the 
closures will come from the 119 Homefed branches that Chatsworth-based Great 
Western acquired for $151 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the branches either closed or to be closed, 29 are in San Diego County and 
16 are in Orange County. Another 15 are in Los Angeles County, four are in 
Ventura County, two are in Santa Barbara County and four are in San Luis Obispo 
County. Accounts at the closed branches will be moved to nearby offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western and other lenders are furiously cutting overhead in the face of 
growing competition for deposits and borrowers from mutual funds and mortgage 
bankers. Even before acquiring Homefed, Great Western last fall launched a 
drastic cost-cutting program called "Performance 94" that could eliminate up to 
1,000 administrative jobs in Chatsworth.  
</P>
<P>
 For many institutions, including Great Western, the key to efficiency is to 
concentrate as many accounts as possible in fewer branches, which minimizes 
payroll and building expenses. Unfortunately for employees, that means branch 
closings and layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 When it made the winning bid for Homefed, Great Western acknowledged that the 
main attraction in buying the failed thrift was its $4 billion in deposits. At 
the time, Great Western predicted that it would close branches and make 
significant layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western Senior Vice President R. Phillip Altman said most of the 
branches to be closed are located near existing Great Western branches. 
</P>
<P>
 But the extent of the job cuts came as something of a surprise. Great Western 
is keeping none of Homefed's 600 administrative employees, most of whom work at 
a five-building complex in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 No decision has been made on how many of Homefed's 1,100 branch employees will 
be cut, but Great Western would eliminate half if the "rule of thumb" of 
consolidations is followed, Altman said. The job cuts could come through 
layoffs as well as attrition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Altman said the final number of layoffs in the branch offices may be 
lower because of job openings elsewhere in the Great Western network. In any 
event, the branch closings, which will include nine existing Great Western 
offices, will be completed by the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's apparent that consolidation is taking place all across the country, and 
there is general agreement that it will continue to take place," said Robert 
Schmermund, spokesman for Washington-based Savings & Community Bankers of 
America, a trade group of thrifts and banks. Illustrating the extent of the 
consolidation, an official at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said 
the number of banks nationwide dropped to 11,363 at the end of the 1992, down 
22% since 1980.

EISNER EARNS $203 MILLION BUT NO BONUS; EXECUTIVES: THE DISNEY CHAIRMAN'S 
COMPENSATION IS A RECORD FOR THE CEO OF A PUBLIC COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner didn't get a 1993 bonus check -- 
largely as a result of problems at the Euro Disney theme park -- but he still 
took home $203.02 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a record for a chief executive of a U.S. public company, and the mighty 
bucks no doubt will make Eisner last year's highest-paid corporate leader. 
Indeed, the only person standing between Eisner and the Guinness Book of World 
Records in the annual pay category is former financier Michael Milken, who 
earned $550 million in 1986 trading junk bonds at Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to rent the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for a benefit concert 
for him because he didn't get a bonus. He'll get by," said executive 
compensation expert Graef S. Crystal, who designed Eisner's pay and incentive 
package a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Disney's annual proxy statement released Monday, almost all of 
Eisner's total compensation in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 came from the 
$202.3-million profit he made when he exercised options on 5.4 million shares 
at the end of 1992 in anticipation of higher taxes from the Clinton 
Administration. Added to that was his annual $750,000 salary -- frozen at that 
level until 1998 -- and $9,667 in miscellaneous pocket change. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, neither Eisner nor Disney President Frank Wells (who 
exercised $60 million worth of options) received a bonus, because Disney's 
return on shareholder equity did not reach the level required to trigger the 
added pay, a factor due entirely to the drag on the company from Euro Disney. 
Under Eisner's contract, Disney must post a return on equity of at least 11%. 
The company's return was 13% before Euro Disney and other adjustments, which 
chopped the return to 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney executives declined to comment on Eisner's pay. 
</P>
<P>
 A whopping total had been expected ever since the company disclosed that 
Eisner was exercising his options before President Clinton took office.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as part of Clinton's first-year budget deal, upper-income taxes were 
raised. Crystal estimated that Eisner personally saved about $17 million by 
exercising the options in late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner still has options on about 8 million shares that he may exercise in the 
future. At today's value, they are worth about $175 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although expected, the disclosure of Eisner's one-year compensation comes at 
an awkward time for the company because it is stumbling due to problems at Euro 
Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's net income plunged 63% in the year ended Sept. 30 to $299.8 
million, largely due to charges related to Euro Disney. The park near Paris has 
suffered from the slow European economy, the strong French franc and the 
tightfistedness of tourists visiting the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney owns 49% of the park's parent company. It is currently negotiating with 
Euro Disney's lenders on a restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent French magazine interview, Eisner said that closing the park was 
one option, although most observers interpret that and other ominous statements 
from the company as a negotiating ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who got the biggest bonus at Disney? Vice Chairman Roy E. Disney, nephew of 
founder Walt Disney and a man estimated by Forbes magazine to be worth $540 
million. Disney, who oversees animation, received a $450,000 bonus, according 
to the proxy, the highest among senior executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Disney said Monday that it is cooperating in helping to produce an 
audit of Euro Disney and denied a complaint by three French banks that it is 
not doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a spokesman for Banque Nationale de Paris said that BNP, Banque 
Indosuez, and Caisse des Depots et Consignations had sent a letter to Disney 
complaining of Disney's non-cooperation.

program, two people can fly round trip between Los Angeles and Seattle for a 
total of $358; a Burbank-San Jose round trip for two is $158.

 Companies Reported Strong Dividend Activity in 1993: In another sign of a 
business revival, U.S. companies increased their dividends last month at the 
strongest rate in a decade, Standard & Poor's said."Dividends obviously are 
being helped by the pickup in the economy in the past few months, which is 
lifting corporate profits and cash flow," said Arnold Kaufman, an S&P analyst. 
Kaufman said the credit-rating agency's survey reflects growing business 
confidence. He said the continued economic expansion is expected to result in 
companies announcing even more dividend increases in 1994. For 1993, S&P said 
U.S. corporations boosted dividends 1,635 times, an increase of 23% from 
activity in 1992.

 Chevron Site Attacked in Angola: Government troops reinforced security around 
the oil company's drill site after an attack wounded one worker and forced 
evacuation of the base, a military officer said.Three mortars rounds exploded 
inside the fortified site in Malongo in the northern Angolan enclave of Cabinda 
just after midnight Saturday, Chevron said. The attackers were believed to be 
members of the Separatist Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda. 
Chevron workers were evacuated by boat to offshore oil rigs. They returned to 
the base Sunday after government troops had secured the area, and production 
resumed.

 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Restructuring Complete: The Santa Monica studio's 
financial revamping was first disclosed in July.The French bank Credit 
Lyonnais, which owns 98.5% of the studio, is shifting about $1 billion in debt 
off MGM's balance sheet. The restructuring, along with efforts to rebuild MGM's 
movie business, is aimed at making it more attractive to potential suitors. The 
bank took over the studio when former owner Giancarlo Parretti defaulted on 
loans, and, under U.S. banking law, must sell it by 1997.

IT MAY TAKE A REAL JUDGE TO SETTLE THIS MATTER; COURTS: WORKERS' COMPENSATION 
JUDGES ARE NOW OFFICIALLY 'REFEREES.' THE TITLE CHANGE HAS SPARKED AN UPROAR 
AND A MOVE TO OVERTURN IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You can dump huge caseloads on judges, force them to work in cramped offices 
and pay them far less than many of the lawyers who appear in their courts. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's one thing -- maybe -- that you can't do: take away their titles. 
</P>
<P>
 That, at least, appears to be the case, so far, in California's workers' 
compensation courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The egos of the state's roughly 180 workers' compensation judges were battered 
last summer when the Legislature, in one small part of a big reform package, 
voted to downgrade their title to "referee." Although there has been some 
quibbling about when and how the name change should take effect, most observers 
agree the provision was supposed to kick in Monday with the start of the new 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But largely because of a blend of pride, pragmatism and logistics, nothing 
much is happening on the title change front -- even though other parts of the 
reform package are being implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision -- which has no impact on the jurists' job duties or pay -- was 
inserted into the reform package by Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Upland). He attributed 
it at the time, among other things, to his frustration with the performance of 
the judges, some of whom are being investigated for allegedly accepting 
improper gifts and speaking fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The move triggered an uproar among the judges, whose title has been one of 
their few perks. Some privately accuse Leonard of acting purely out of spite. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a giant slap in the face," said Samuel L. Sosna Jr., president of the 
Conference of California Workers' Compensation Judges, who also presides over 
the workers' compensation court in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Sosna noted the vast economic impact and heavy demands of the job, which 
involves resolving sometimes-costly disputes among insurers, employers and 
workers over on-the-job injury claims. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a certain authority and aura about the office," he said. "The office 
(because of the title change) has been made less attractive, and I'm sure we'll 
get less attractive candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, almost no one seems to be calling the jurists "referees" yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers, loath to offend the people who decide their cases, have kept 
addressing them as judges. 
</P>
<P>
 And officials with the California Division of Workers' Compensation, 
apparently sympathetic to the jurists' cause, haven't hurried to carry out the 
title change. Among other things, they haven't issued the judges-referees new 
business cards or new nameplates for their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, this part of the workers' compensation reform is not the highest 
priority," said Richard Stevens, a spokesman for the division. Officials "are 
focusing on the substantive, cost-saving provisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens also noted that hurrying to complete the title switch could be a waste 
of effort because the judges-referees are already lobbying the Legislature to 
get their old titles back.

FLEXIBLE SICK-LEAVE POLICIES CAN BENEFIT COMPANIES; LABOR: LIBERAL RULES MAY 
SAVE MONEY BUT CAN BE UNFAIR. SOME FIRMS GIVE WORKERS A SET NUMBER OF DAYS OFF 
FOR ALL PURPOSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Companies that adopt a liberal sick-leave policy, one that allows employees to 
take an extra day or two off now and then, may find they have reduced their 
turnover and saved themselves a bundle.  
</P>
<P>
 But they may also find they have created a two-tier policy that satisfies some 
workers while rubbing others the wrong way.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some people may need to be absent more often than others in order to keep 
their job," says Prof. William Todor of Ohio State University, Columbus. "A 
liberal absenteeism policy can allow them some flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Working mothers, employees with a sick relative or those experiencing a 
personal crisis, for example, all may need more time off than their colleagues. 
And a flexible sick-leave policy could allow those who need extra time to take 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key for a company is to determine if it can help employees cope with the 
problems that cause them to be absent without hurting productivity," Todor 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 But employees who do not benefit from the expanded policy may resent the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be opposed to giving any employees more benefits than others, because 
it creates the underpinnings of personnel problems that don't exist," says Bob 
Luddy, president of Captive-Aire Systems Inc., a Youngsville, N.C.-based 
manufacturer of restaurant ventilation systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Luddy's firm, which has more than 200 employees, avoids the issue by giving 
workers 24 days off a year after two years for whatever purposes they wish. The 
practice eliminates special paid days off for sick leave, which he says causes 
some workers to take days off for "nefarious" reasons. Levi Strauss & Co., 
based in San Francisco, is among the larger companies that have adopted similar 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cleveland Electric Co., a manufacturer of industrial machinery, the notion 
of a liberal sick-leave policy is unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The belief we have here," says spokeswoman Jenny Ogborn, "is that we have no 
need to pay somebody for work they are not doing."  
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Cleveland Electric is a non-union firm at which most of the 2,700 
employees are piecework hires, Ogborn says, "They could get a leave of absence, 
but they would not get paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Todor believes too many companies design strict sick-leave and transfer 
policies without thinking through the implications for turnover or the cost to 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 A strict policy that causes employees to quit -- when all they need is more 
time off but can't get it -- can run up a hefty bill for replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have to invest two years training a worker to reach maximum 
productivity, that's a very costly person to lose," Todor says. 
</P>
<P>
 A company needs to determine "if employees are abusing the sick-leave policy 
or truly have reasons to be absent from the job," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Americans call in sick about 25 million days a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Their tendency, says one authority, is to take all the sick days they have 
coming and then some. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are generally absent for the number of sick days they are allowed, 
plus 10%," Dennis Murphy, publisher of Practical Supervision, a Round Rock, 
Tex.-based training newsletter, recently told Entrepreneur magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy says managers should stop employees from giving phony reasons for being 
absent, such as the worker who called in sick practically every Friday during 
hunting season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask them what's wrong and how long they expect to be away from work. Then 
simply tell them they will be missed and you hope they get better soon," he 
says.

MANUFACTURING GROWTH CONTINUES; ECONOMY: PLANTS WERE BUSIER FOR THIRD STRAIGHT 
MONTH, KEY INDUSTRY GROUP SAYS. TWO MILLION MORE JOBS EXPECTED IN '94. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sign of the continuing resurgence of the nation's economy, manufacturing 
plants were busier for a third straight month in December, a key industry group 
reported Monday. White House officials predicted the strengthening economy will 
create 2 million jobs this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Purchasing Management said its December index climbed to 
57.9 from 55.9 in November as 13 out of 20 industries reported stronger 
business. Prices fell and job prospects brightened, the industry group said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Continuing growth in new orders, combined with low inventories and generally 
decreasing prices, will enable December to usher out 1993 with the highest rate 
of economic growth since January, 1993," said Robert Bretz, chairman of the 
association's business survey committee. 
</P>
<P>
 All the evidence of a strong closing quarter, with economic growth exceeding 
4%, led Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich to forecast a drop in the unemployment 
rate this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs lagged during the slow but steady recovery from the 1990-91 recession, 
partly because companies concentrated on boosting efficiency by trimming work 
forces and squeezing more from current employees rather than hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 That was reflected during 1993 in rising overtime hours, while the national 
unemployment rate slowly nudged down from 7.1% a year ago to 6.4% now. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reich said he expects 2 million jobs will be created in 1994 and that 
unemployment will drop further. The December jobless rate is scheduled to be 
issued Friday, and economists surveyed by Reuters forecast that 215,000 jobs 
will be added. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the basis of the early indications, unemployment should be down, I would 
say, probably in the range of 6% to 6.4%," Reich said on ABC television's "Good 
Morning America." Another upbeat prediction came from Deputy Treasury Secretary 
Roger Altman, in a separate interview on NBC's "Today" show. He said interest 
rates will be "relatively subdued" in 1994 while the economy grows at a 3% 
annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Low interest rates spurred a second-half economic bounce in 1993, especially 
in the housing and auto sectors. Altman pointed out that, after accounting for 
inflation, rates are the lowest in 20 or 30 years, "and that can't continue 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's no basis, either in meaningfully higher inflation or in much 
greater credit demand, to expect that interest rates would rise in a sustained 
way this year," Altman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect that interest rates will stay in a relatively subdued fashion in 
1994," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stimulative impact of low interest rates was apparent in a separate 
Commerce Department report Monday on November construction spending, which 
posted a seventh successive monthly rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Total construction spending increased 1.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of $497.7 billion, after gaining 2.5% in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending grew in every month of 1993 except April, when it fell 1.2%, as 
homeowners refinanced at cheaper rates and added to their household incomes 
while new-home buyers rushed into the market at a growing pace before rates 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the November gain was a 3.3% pickup in spending on residential 
construction to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $221.8 billion. Both 
single-family home building and construction of apartments grew from October. 
</P>
<P>
 "The housing sector continues to look very strong," economist Lynn Reaser of 
First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles said. "It's an area of strength for the 
entire economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaser noted that the purchasing managers report for November includes a gain 
in its employment index to 49.2 from 46.1. An employment index above 48, over 
time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics data on manufacturing employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report looks very solid," Reaser said. "Manufacturing struggled at 
midyear last year, but it is certainly starting 1994 on a strong foot."

'TRAVEL AGENT' RUSE REAPS DISCOUNTS; TOURISM: PEOPLE WITHOUT TRAINING ARE 
OBTAINING CREDENTIALS TO QUALIFY FOR THE LOWER FARES. STATE SAYS POLICING IS UP 
TO THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY.

 Former California congressman Jim Bates says posing as a travel agent to get 
discounts seemed like a pretty good deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sales gimmick. I don't think I see anything wrong with it," said 
Bates, now a political consultant in San Diego and a part-time rancher in 
Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates is among a number of Americans who, without any relevant training or 
qualifications, are getting travel agent credentials that entitle them to huge 
vacation discounts and VIP treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates, who served in Congress as a Democrat from San Diego, said he purchased 
a card that identified him as a travel agent a couple of years ago and was 
happy to get the discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 His name was used by World View International of San Diego in advertisements 
that said for $495 anyone could become an "independent contractor" and qualify 
for reduced rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "In three trips, I saved over $1,000. I'm sold on World View and recommend 
them to my friends," the Bates testimonial said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former congressman, who said in an interview that he does not recall 
paying $495 to World View, said he has no complaint with the travel agency, 
which claims that thousands have paid to become its "independent" agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Donlan, who heads World View, did not return repeated calls to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who purchase credentials or get them from friends receive no formal 
training. Travel agencies generally do not require their employees to undergo 
training. But many agencies prefer that applicants complete courses -- usually 
lasting six weeks -- that familiarize workers with the increasingly complex 
world of computerized reservations systems. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little that law enforcement can do to address the problem, says one 
California prosecutor who looked into the matter but decided there were no 
grounds for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would seem to be up to the various hotels and airlines to police it. I 
seriously doubt there is a violation," said Hershel Elkins of the California 
attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing a black eye to the industry, travel agent trade groups are taking 
matters into their own hands by developing a counterfeit-resistant 
identification card aimed at exposing scam agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The new cards will "weed out the phony agents," said Paul Ruden, counsel for 
the American Society of Travel Agents. "We are dealing with it." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no hard estimate on the number of phony agents, although the industry 
says it is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who offer the discounts, such as hotels and airlines, the issue is 
more one of credibility than economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no big financial loss," said Jack Williams, a marketing executive with 
American Airlines. "But it's a problem. It leaves the impression we have a 
bunch of crooks, and we don't have that at all." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, a bona fide agent will place the name of a friend or customer 
on an approved list of agents submitted to travel providers, such as airlines, 
cruise lines, hotels, group tours and car rental companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The suppliers, who give the discounts to promote business from travel agents, 
may rely on the lists as proof an individual is the real McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Other agencies, such as World View International, sell membership cards to the 
general public, promising discounts for travelers who have no intention of 
becoming agents themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Anastassia Mann, who runs a Los Angeles travel agency, said the practice has 
been growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extensive, particularly in the entertainment industry. They say: 'I'll 
give you my business. But I want to be on your list.' The companies that won't 
cooperate don't get the corporate business," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is too much abuse," Mann said. "We have to professionalize the benefits 
of this industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Kaplan, another Los Angeles travel agent, said, "Our system tolerates in 
the travel industry what it doesn't in other industries." 
</P>
<P>
 But there appears to be nothing illegal about the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Society of Travel Agents, representing about half the 32,000 
travel agency outlets in the nation plus some 10,000 travel supply businesses, 
thinks the new ID card is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The card will include a hologram to prevent forgeries and assure suppliers 
that those who get agent discounts are working to earn them. 
</P>
<P>
 The punishment for transgressors would be expulsion from travel agency trade 
groups, which could hurt business. Membership in ASTA and other trade 
organizations is an emblem of professional credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 ASTA also recently amended its code of ethics to say that no member will 
provide credentials to people not in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who offer discounts are also taking precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Kaufman of Disney Attractions, which manages the Disney theme parks, said 
agents must apply for discounts two weeks in advance and are carefully checked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're real strict," he said. "We're tough as nails to get something out of. 
We look at the agents as partners. The ones that are producing we help."

COMPANY TOWN; STERN'S GROSS SPECIAL TOPS PAY-TV GROSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Howard Stern's raunchy New Year's Eve special looks to be the top-grossing 
entertainment pay-per-view program of all time, beating out the previous record 
holder, a 1991 concert by the squeaky-clean pop group New Kids on the Block. 
</P>
<P>
 Main Events Television, which distributed the "Miss Howard Stern New Year's 
Eve Pageant," said a final tally will not be available until later this week, 
but the company estimated that more than 270,000 homes paid an average of 
$39.95 for the one hour and 50 minute special. If those figures hold up, the 
special will have grossed at least $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "In markets where Howard is No. 1 on the radio, we outdrew prizefights," said 
Kathy Duva, marketing director at Totowa, N.J.-based Main Events. "I think we 
did very well." 
</P>
<P>
 How much of the take shock jock Stern actually gets is unclear, but after Main 
Events takes its 45% distribution fee and $2 million in production and 
marketing costs are subtracted, Stern could earn in the neighborhood of $5 
million to $6 million, observers estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Another record probably set by Stern's show is for bad taste during a live 
telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers who tuned in got to witness a woman eat live maggots, see "Star Wars" 
actor Mark Hamill lick chocolate sauce off a woman's breast, and watch Stern 
offer John Wayne Bobbitt $15,000 to expose his severed penis on camera. (He 
declined, but Bobbitt did earn $260,000 from the sale of "severed part" 
T-shirts.) 
</P>
<P>
 None of which kept pay-per-view industry executives from pronouncing the 
telecast a roaring success. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a phenomenal event," said Bonnie Werth, president of Team Services, 
an independent PPV marketing firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stern probably has a franchise now," Werth said. 
</P>
<P>
 No word yet, however, on when Stern plans his second show. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's gone on vacation," Duva said. "He deserves one."

DEALS: COMPANY TOWN

 Technology: Sony Pictures Entertainment is increasing its commitment to new 
technology. The budget for the company's new-technologies division for the next 
fiscal year will jump from about $25 million to about $80 million, according to 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds are earmarked for the development of a virtual reality system and 
other entertainment projects, sources said. The division's staff and overhead 
will not expand significantly. A Sony spokesperson refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony's new-technology group, which is headed by Mitchell Cannold, was formed 
about 18 months ago to develop and analyze new-technology opportunities for 
Sony's various entertainment units. With the consolidation of Sony's U.S. 
entertainment and electronics divisions last spring, the group's purview 
expanded to include all of Sony Corp.'s U.S. divisions.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Cannold's group facilitated Sony's agreement to finance and 
distribute three films produced by Interfilm, in which the audience can choose 
plot twists and influence the ending. 
</P>
<P>
 As companies such as Iwerks, Showscan and Imax push the limits of the 
traditional movie theater experience, and as advances in interactive television 
and high-definition TV promise to alter entertainment in the home, all of the 
major studios are looking at new ways to move motion pictures into the new 
generation of entertainment products. AMY HARMON

 Spotlight on Walt Disney Co.: Following reports that Euro Disney had posted a 
net loss of $905 million in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, Chairman Michael D. 
Eisner acknowledged that the European theme park's performance has been 
"dreadful" and said the huge loss was the "first real financial disappointment" 
of his nearly 10-year tenure at Disney. The possibility of closing the park has 
not been ruled out, but such action would probably not be taken until at least 
late spring. Major Properties

SEERS USE STARS, STATS TO DIVINE O.C. FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time to check the final score. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Esmael Adibi, the head of Chapman University's Center for Economic 
Research in Orange, and astrologer Laura Rose DesJardins, the owner of 
Astro-Forecast in Costa Mesa, agreed to match wits and predict what 1993 had in 
store for us all. 
</P>
<P>
 Both came well recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 Adibi and his crew of academic number crunchers have made predictions for 
years about Orange County's economy for local business leaders. And for 21 
years, DesJardins has made a decent living discreetly searching the stars and 
calculating their influence on business for boardrooms across Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The past recession-weary year was no cakewalk for anyone in the 
prognosticating field. Economic crystal balls grew cloudy with a new 
Administration in Washington pushing for sweeping changes in trade, health care 
and tariffs. Still, our local prognosticators did fairly well on their 
predictions about how Orange County in general and four broad industry sectors 
would fare in 1993. They also looked into the future again to see what this 
year holds. 
</P>
<P>
 They erred on two significant points in 1993. Each side humbly claims 
undisputed victory over the other, but you, the readers, should decide if 
knowing the configurations of Pluto and Saturn are as accurate as knowing the 
county's gross domestic product and local unemployment trends. ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County pretty much remained in the dumps all year. Layoffs were legion 
-- about 15,000 jobs were lost in 1993 -- and many businesses were forced to 
rethink how they operate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Adibi and DesJardins said the county was going to continue suffering only 
until mid-1993, then job losses were to give way to growth. They also predicted 
that increased foreign trade was going to lay a patina of hope over Orange 
County's dull economic landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh huh. Sorry, guys. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter that Orange County's astrological sign is Leo and that it was 
being influenced by Sagittarius or that the gross national product grew 4.4% by 
the fourth quarter and that taxable sales were up 3.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County was still in a slump.  
</P>
<P>
 "That is one area in which I kind of blew it," Adibi said. "But we both did." 
</P>
<P>
 What neither counted on was that corporate executives, shaken by the 
uncertainty of health care reform, deferred hiring until they get a better idea 
what effect reform will have on their payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 DesJardins' and Adibi's predictions about new foreign trade opportunities also 
were a bit premature. But that is changing rapidly, according to their 
predictions for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is taking on a whole new image and is revitalizing itself," 
DesJardins said, pointing out that Saturn and Neptune will play significant 
positive roles in the year ahead. "The old image is ending completely." 
</P>
<P>
 Adibi takes a more conservative posture. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton's tax package has significant contractionary fiscal 
implications associated with it, particularly in the first half of this year 
when the higher tax liabilities need to be paid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, expect another bearish year for Orange County. HIGH TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
<P>
 That was the only area in which the two forecasters differed significantly. 
DesJardins said that the high-tech industry, fueled by a conjunction of Uranus 
and Neptune, would be on the upswing in 1993; Adibi gave it a thumbs down. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, DesJardins, your worthy opponent wins this one. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-tech industry ended up losing 5,000 jobs, largely caused by continued 
cutbacks in defense. In fact, Adibi said, expect more to come. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-December, for instance, Rockwell International Corp. said it plans to 
cut an additional 500 jobs from its Seal Beach and Downey plants. Other defense 
contractors looking to downsize or convert to commercial production face 
similar fates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, we don't need that much defense," Adibi said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her defense, DesJardins points out that she didn't receive information to 
chart defense firms in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 She notes that she accurately predicted a rise in computer companies in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 DesJardins points out that companies such as AST Research Inc. in Irvine, 
which makes computer hardware, have done well overall. Vice President Al Gore 
visited AST in September, praising its corporate restructuring, and then took 
time for a photo with AST Chief Executive Safi Qureshey. 
</P>
<P>
 As a footnote, DesJardins accurately predicted last year that Roger Johnson, 
head of Western Digital Inc. in Irvine, would leave the firm for bigger and 
better things. He was tapped by President Clinton in July to be chief of the 
General Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Her tidbit for the future was not reported in last year's story because -- 
hey! Who would have believed it? HEALTH CARE 
</P>
<P>
 It was a safe bet for both to predict last year that the health care industry 
was poised to receive a welcome boost under Clinton's reform proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Health maintenance organizations Pacifi-Care Health Systems Inc. in Cypress 
and FHP Inc. in Fountain Valley had stellar years in membership growth and 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But HMOs aside, the county's overall health care sector didn't grow as 
aggressively as either had predicted. Only about 500 jobs were gained for the 
county, largely because of job cuts at medical device makers Beckman 
Instruments Inc. in Fullerton, Allergan Inc. in Irvine and drug distributor 
Bergen Brunswig Corp. in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even HMOs are not even sure which ones will be around in the future," said 
Adibi. "There is a real vagueness out there." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, both said recently, this year will be painful for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Continued job losses, Adibi said, will cut into managed care membership and 
will trickle down to hurt the fast growth of HMOs. DesJardins agrees, what with 
that pesky Saturn moving into the sun at the same time Pluto is moving into 
Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a whole new chart," she said. "It looks like a double whammy." TOURISM 
AND ENTERTAINMENT 
</P>
<P>
 The tourism and entertainment industry, including lodging and food services, 
showed a few more signs of life than real estate, defense and other major 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 That, after all, is what Adibi and DesJardins both predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Adibi said the industry took in 2% more revenue than it did in 1992, mainly 
driven by visitors from other areas of the country where the economy is 
reviving. 
</P>
<P>
 But what he didn't predict was that employment was flat. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses "got more out of existing workers by offering overtime instead of 
hiring new employees," Adibi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stars will continue to be good for the industry this year because of the 
influence of the constellation Sagittarius, DesJardins predicted. And even 
Disney will benefit from the moon moving into Neptune, making a major positive 
decision by mid-year. After all, Neptune represents image. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney, of course, needs to make a decision soon on whether to continue its 
$3-billion plan to expand Disneyland in Anaheim into a resort, complete with a 
Westcot theme park. The plans were thrown in doubt after the company lost $514 
million on its Euro Disney park in Paris for its fiscal year ended Sept. 30. 
REAL ESTATE 
</P>
<P>
 "What more can we say?" Adibi said, shaking his head. "We were right about 
real estate." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the continuing decline in the real estate market might have been an 
easy pick for anyone to make. In fact, the average home price dropped an 
additional 3.3% for 1993 -- on top of a 1.4% drop for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Adibi attributed his prediction to the simple proposition that 
unemployed folks were not interested in taking out home loans, even if home 
prices and interest rates were at their lowest levels in years. 
</P>
<P>
 DesJardins said the source of the problem was grander than that. It was the 
fact that Saturn, Neptune and Uranus were all in Capricorn, a configuration 
that represented limitations, restrictions, losses and delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it over? 
</P>
<P>
 Not on your life, both said. 
</P>
<P>
 DesJardins said to wait at least another year, when all three planets 
reposition themselves to a more lucrative configuration. 
</P>
<P>
 So there you have it. 
</P>
<P>
 Is stargazing -- DesJardins calls it cosmic biology -- as accurate as the 
number-crunching computers at Chapman University? 
</P>
<P>
 That is for you to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 The better question could be: Why go through the exercise of forecasting at 
all? 
</P>
<P>
 Both Adibi and DesJardins defend the practice as vital to employers, who must 
chart courses for their enterprises, and to employees, who need help making 
valuable decisions about personal finances such as home purchases and other 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an awesome responsibility," Adibi said, noting that picking up the right 
trends is the most difficult part of forecasting. "But I think we did 
excellently. Only I did better." 
</P>
<P>
 Humph! says DesJardins. She points out that she did just as well with her 
general predictions and better with such specific prognostications as Roger 
Johnson's departure from Western Digital.

GREAT WESTERN TO LAY OFF MOST HOMEFED EMPLOYEES; BANKING: COMPANY MAY RELEASE 
TWO-THIRDS OF PAYROLL IT INHERITED WHEN IT ACQUIRED FAILED THRIFT. IT IS ALSO 
CLOSING 70 BRANCH OFFICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Great Western Bank said Monday that it may lay off as many as two thirds of 
the 1,700 new employees inherited when it acquired the failed Homefed Bank from 
the federal government last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western, the nation's second-largest thrift, also said it has closed 13 
branches and will close another 57 by the end of next month. Most of the 
closures will come from the 119 Homefed branches that Chatsworth-based Great 
Western acquired for $151 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the branches either closed or to be closed, 29 are in San Diego County and 
16 are in Orange County. Another 15 are in Los Angeles County, four are in 
Ventura County, two are in Santa Barbara County and four are in San Luis Obispo 
County. Accounts at the closed branches will be moved to nearby offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western and other lenders are furiously cutting overhead in the face of 
growing competition for deposits and borrowers from mutual funds and mortgage 
bankers. Even before acquiring Homefed, Great Western last fall launched a 
drastic cost-cutting program called "Performance 94" that could eliminate up to 
1,000 administrative jobs in Chatsworth.  
</P>
<P>
 For many institutions, including Great Western, the key to efficiency is to 
concentrate as many accounts as possible in fewer branches, which minimizes 
payroll and building expenses. Unfortunately for employees, that means branch 
closings and layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 When it made the winning bid for Homefed, Great Western acknowledged that the 
main attraction in buying the failed thrift was its $4 billion in deposits. At 
the time, Great Western predicted that it would close branches and make 
significant layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western Senior Vice President R. Phillip Altman said most of the 
branches to be closed are located near existing Great Western branches. 
</P>
<P>
 But the extent of the job cuts came as something of a surprise. Great Western 
is keeping none of Homefed's 600 administrative employees, most of whom work at 
a five-building complex in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 No decision has been made on how many of Homefed's 1,100 branch employees will 
be cut, but Great Western would eliminate half if the "rule of thumb" of 
consolidations is followed, Altman said. The job cuts could come through 
layoffs as well as attrition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Altman said the final number of layoffs in the branch offices may be 
lower because of job openings elsewhere in the Great Western network. In any 
event, the branch closings, which will include nine existing Great Western 
offices, will be completed by the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's apparent that consolidation is taking place all across the country, and 
there is general agreement that it will continue to take place," said Robert 
Schmermund, spokesman for Washington-based Savings & Community Bankers of 
America, a trade group of thrifts and banks. Illustrating the extent of the 
consolidation, an official at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said 
the number of banks nationwide dropped to 11,363 at the end of the 1992, down 
22% since 1980. Bank Consolidation

are expected to be consolidated in Orange County as a result of Great Western's 
acquisition of Homefed. 02,36,28 Closing branch Accounts transferred to Buena

 Pow! Wham! 
</P>
<P>
 Sunsoft Inc. is starting the new year with a bang. 
</P>
<P>
 The video-game developer, a subsidiary of Japan's Sun Electronics Corp., said 
it signed a five-year contract with DC Comics to create Nintendo and Sega video 
games based on DC's popular super heroes.Sunsoft will develop video games for a 
variety of platforms based on well-known comic-book characters Batman, 
Superman, Flash, Aquaman, Wonder Woman and Green Arrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunsoft plans to release its first game, "Justice League," for the Super 
Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis machines in January, 1995. 
Sunsoft has already created games based on Batman and Superman, but the latest 
deal is the first in which DC has licensed its team of super heroes, who are 
known as Justice League America. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunsoft has also signed a deal to promote its Looney Tunes character video 
games on packages of Kellogg's Raisin Bran cereal. The promotion, which offers 
a discount on the games, runs through April. 
</P>
<P>
 Such alliances have helped Sunsoft expand in the United States. The company, 
based in Cypress, projects sales of $80 million this year, up from an estimated 
$50 million for 1993. In addition to its 40 employees, Sunsoft is using more 
than 600 independent contractors to develop its games.

O.C. FIRM FORGING HUNGARIAN TIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 SPI Pharmaceuticals Inc., a subsidiary of ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., on Monday 
announced plans to buy 30% of a state-owned drug manufacturer in Hungary for an 
undisclosed amount. Completion of the transaction awaits approval by the 
Hungarian government. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, Alkaloida, makes about 60 products -- including medicinal 
morphine, antacids and treatments for asthma -- sold in 80 countries. It is 
based in Tiszavasvari, Hungary, and employs 2,100 people. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN spokesman David Calef said the purchase will fit into his company's plan 
to expand its presence in Eastern Europe. "We're looking at other acquisitions 
as well," he said. "Eastern Europe is a huge, untapped market." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal includes an option for SPI to increase its stake in Alkaloida to 51% 
in the future. "Eventually, we would like to own a controlling interest in the 
company," Calef said. 
</P>
<P>
 SPI, based in Costa Mesa, now sells 600 drug products in more than 60 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent ICN already has a subsidiary, ICN Galenika, outside Belgrade, 
Yugoslavia. And in April ICN created a joint venture, ICN Oktyabr, with a 
company in St. Petersburg, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to that part of the world, I doubt there is anyone in the 
pharmaceutical business as connected as ICN," said Dennis Roth, and analyst 
with the brokerage Lew Lieberbaum & Co. in Long Island, N.Y. "But that area is 
so volatile that some of the deals might not work out as well as they would 
like."

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT FOR PARTNERSHIP'S SANTA ANA 
BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A limited partnership partly owned by former Orange County developer Robert A. 
Ferrante is seeking bankruptcy protection for a four-story office building in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 OCPC Ltd. in Torrance made its Chapter 11 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 
Santa Ana on Dec. 30.A hearing is scheduled for March 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers' 
pension fund holds the first deed of trust to the 127,000-square-foot red brick 
building at 801 Civic Center Drive West and is owed $19 million by the 
partnership, said attorney Lloyd Segal, who is representing the partnership. 
Tenants in the building include the Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce, several law 
firms and some Orange County offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrante, 43, once owned Consolidated Savings Bank in Irvine, which failed in 
1986. He was acquitted last year of criminal charges in a bank fraud case filed 
by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 13, Ferrante filed for personal bankruptcy, listing debts of $24.2 
million and assets of only $777,300.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: MATTHEWS STUDIO POSTS LOSS OF $1.04 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Matthews Studio Equipment Group, a Burbank-based supplier of cameras and other 
equipment for the entertainment industry, reported a loss of $1.04 million for 
its fiscal fourth quarter on a 12% drop in earnings compared with a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss for the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with a profit of $13,000 
in the same period a year earlier.Revenue in the latest quarter dropped 12% to 
$6.19 million, from $7.06 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For its full fiscal year, Matthews Studio posted a loss of $390,000, 
contrasted to a profit of $318,000 for the prior fiscal year. Its fiscal year 
revenue fell 15% to $25.9 million, from $30.4 million a year earlier. The 
company said its latest fiscal year results included charges of about $1.25 
million for refurbishment of equipment and restructuring costs at Keylite 
Holdings Inc., which Matthews Studio bought last May.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: AMERICAN PACIFIC STATE BANK'S PROFIT FALLS 26% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Pacific State Bank in Sherman Oaks said its third-quarter profit fell 
26% due to increased reserves for future loan losses. 
</P>
<P>
 American Pacific, which has six branches in the San Fernando Valley, earned 
$477,000 for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $642,000 a year 
earlier. In the latest third quarter, the bank transferred $675,000 into loan 
loss reserves, nearly double that of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months ended Sept. 30, American Pacific posted a profit of $1.37 
million, a drop of 21% from $1.74 million in the same period a year earlier. 
The bank reported that its assets held steady at $230 million as of Sept. 30.

ROCKETDYNE'S SKIES MAY GET CROWDED; AEROSPACE: ROCKWELL UNIT MAY FACE 
COMPETITION AS AEROJET AGREES TO MARKET HIGH-PERFORMANCE RUSSIAN ROCKET ENGINES 
FOR SATELLITE LAUNCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At a time when Rocketdyne is stinging from cutbacks in NASA's budget, a rival 
aerospace firm has set up a joint venture with a Russian company that could 
threaten Rocketdyne's lucrative business making rocket engines for commercial 
and military satellite launches. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential challenge comes from Aerojet of Sacramento, which last month 
said it had signed a pact with Samara State Scientific and Production 
Enterprise to refurbish and market 102 rocket engines that were produced by the 
former Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
 Those engines, called NK-33, were initially designed in the late 1950s for the 
Soviet N1 Moon rocket project. Most of them are fully built and are now stored 
in a warehouse in Russia. Aerojet hopes to market them as a lower-cost military 
and commercial satellite launch vehicle for the U.S. Atlas and Delta rockets, 
which have long been powered largely by Rocketdyne's first-stage engines. 
Rocketdyne's Atlas and Delta motors, sometimes called booster engines, are what 
initially propel the satellite rockets into space. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Rocketdyne's engines, the NK-33 is propelled by liquid oxygen and 
kerosene. But the Russian engine runs at higher pressures and temperatures, 
making it more efficient and powerful than comparable U.S. engines, including 
Rocketdyne's. But the NK-33 has yet to be test fired in the United States, and 
Aerojet still needs to line up funding from NASA or other sources to help it 
get the NK-33 ready to meet U.S. standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Lee, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., 
got a good look at the NK-33 at a recent display of the engine. Based on what 
he saw, Lee said the NK-33 could be a cheaper alternative because the engines 
have already been built and need only to be modified, presumably at a fraction 
of the cost of building an engine from scratch. "I would say there probably 
would be some concern at Rocketdyne," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price is a big factor, experts say, because NASA and others have been studying 
ways to lower the cost of commercial and military satellite launches, which are 
more expensive in the United States than Europe or Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake are contracts worth tens of millions of dollars a year. Rocketdyne, 
the Canoga Park unit of Seal Beach-based Rockwell International, currently gets 
$5 million for each Delta engine it builds, and almost $10 million for an Atlas 
engine. Last year there were seven Delta and five Atlas launches. Rocketdyne's 
work on the Delta and Atlas engines probably accounts for 10% of its overall 
business, which approaches $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 At present Rocketdyne faces no competition for those types of engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Sprow, Aerojet's program manager for the NK-33, said the Russian engines 
are technically superior to Rocketdyne's because the NK-33 uses a so-called 
closed cycle that pumps all the fuel into the main engine chamber, rather than 
jettisoning some to prevent overheating, as Rocketdyne's engines do. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprow hopes to get the NK-33 engines to market by late 1995. Aerojet, a 
subsidiary of Ohio-based GenCorp, currently makes the first- and second-stage 
rocket engines that power the Titan satellite rockets, which are launched by 
Martin Marietta. Aerojet also builds the second-stage engine for the Delta 
rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter McCourt, Rocketdyne's vice president of business development, 
questioned whether the NK-33 could make it to the U.S. market. "So far as we 
know, the NK-33 has never flown successfully," he said. "They had four launches 
of the N1 Moon rocket, and all four were failures. There's absolutely zero 
flight-reliability data." 
</P>
<P>
 Aerojet confirmed that the four NK-1 rocket launches did fail. But Aerojet 
said that was not due to a flaw in the first-stage NK-33 engine, which Aerojet 
claimed performed successfully, but was due to a flaw in another engine. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, McCourt said, Rocketdyne-powered Atlas and Delta rockets have 
flown for 20 years with near-flawless performance. But last March a Rocketdyne 
Atlas rocket malfunctioned due to a loose screw inside the engine, resulting in 
a $137-million satellite failing to reach its correct orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprow conceded that the NK-33 was far from ready for delivery. Besides 
test-firings, he said changes must be made in Russian instrumentation as well 
as mechanical and electrical connections. Sprow added that the joint venture 
hoped to get a commitment from a potential buyer before investing heavily in 
the NK-33. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas Aerospace in Huntington Beach, which launches the Delta 
rockets, said it has been briefed on the NK-33. But spokeswoman Anne McCauley 
said only, "We are following Aerojet's activities with the Russians." 
</P>
<P>
 General Dynamics Space Systems Division in San Diego, which last month 
announced it was being sold to Martin Marietta for $208.5 million, is the 
general contractor of the Atlas launch vehicle. Officials at General Dynamics 
would not comment on the Russian engine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne's current contract with General Dynamics calls for delivery of 62 
Atlas engines for a total of $600 million. In February, Rocketdyne signed a 
six-year $200-million deal with McDonnell Douglas to build 40 Delta engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne cannot afford to lose those two contracts, because two-thirds of 
its revenue comes from NASA for work on the space shuttle's main engine and the 
electrical power system for the proposed space station -- both of which are 
facing budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall Congress sharply curtailed the space station budget, and future 
funding for U.S. contractors is uncertain because that program is expected to 
be undertaken jointly with the Russians. And NASA has said it wants to lower 
its cost for space shuttle launches. To prepare for leaner times, Rocketdyne 
said in November that it would trim up to 990 workers, or 15% of its 6,600 
employees. Currently, between 500 and 700 Rocketdyne employees work on the 
Atlas and Delta engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Rocketdyne, Aerojet has had its share of troubles because of NASA's 
belt-tightening. Aerojet now produces the orbital propulsion system on the 
space shuttle, and it had been working for three years on developing an 
advanced solid rocket motor for the space shuttle. But NASA scrapped that 
program last fall, resulting in layoffs of about 500 Aerojet workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some of the NK-33's specifications are unmatched by comparable U.S. 
engines, said Walter Williams, a retired NASA chief engineer and now an 
aerospace consultant in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 The NK-33, for example, has greater thrust, or the force by which a rocket is 
driven, than Rocketdyne's engines. And as a result, experts say, the NK-33 can 
carry heavier payloads. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams said performance was just one issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "What will it cost to get the NK-33 ready for use for U.S. launch vehicles?" 
he asked. "What is its safety record? What will the Russians want for the 
engines?"

VALLEY-AREA STOCKS DIDN'T KEEP PACE WITH KEY INDEXES IN 1993; PRICES: INDEX 
SHOWS 6.5% INCREASE FOR 105 LOCAL COMPANIES. BUT NASDAQ COMPOSITE FIGURE ROSE 
14.8%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It didn't pay nearly as much to invest in local small-company stocks in 1993 
as it did the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Conejo valleys and Ventura 
County performed less well than the national stock market last year, reflecting 
the lingering Southern California recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The index of 105 Valley-area stocks, which mostly represent smaller companies, 
rose 6.5% in 1993, according to Media General Financial Services, a Richmond, 
Va., firm that compiles the index for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 That was roughly in line with the 7.1% rise last year in the Standard & Poors 
500 composite index, the benchmark index of the nation's largest companies. But 
the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 13.7% last year, and the Nasdaq 
composite index rose 14.8%. The Nasdaq index, which includes about 4,300 
companies, is considered the stock market's broadest measure of small-company 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The price increases registered by local stocks that did perform well in 1993 
were enough to nudge the Valley index higher, even though gainers only slightly 
outnumbered losers. Of the 91 stocks that traded all year, 50 issues advanced 
in price, while 41 fell. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, last year was a strong one for companies having their initial 
public stock offering (IPOs). A total of 14 Valley-area companies went public 
in the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 One strong performer was Iwerks Entertainment Inc., a Burbank company that 
recently unveiled its first virtual-reality attraction. It went public in 
October at $18 a share and closed the year at $26.75, a 49% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The area's best performing stock last year was Players International, a 
Calabasas-based casino operator, whose stock rose 296%, to $24.75 a share at 
year's end. Players opened its second riverboat casino last month in Lake 
Charles, La. The company also operates a riverboat casino out of Metropolis, 
Ill., which has been open about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In its fiscal second quarter that ended Sept. 30, Players earned a profit of 
$3.9 million on $20.3 million of revenue from its riverboat gambling 
operations. In the same period a year ago, Players had a net loss of $1.4 
million from discontinued operations related to closing its discount travel 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Players had struggled to sell memberships in the service, called Players Club 
and aimed at medium-stakes gamblers. But in February, it stopped marketing the 
club and teamed up with celebrity Merv Griffin to launch the Metropolis 
riverboat casino. 
</P>
<P>
 In another sharp reversal, motor-home maker Rexhall Industries Inc. saw its 
stock rise 157% in the past 12 months and closed the year at $6.75. Rexhall, 
based in Saugus, benefited from introducing two new motor-home models and 
expanding its dealer network. The company rebounded from a disastrous 1992 to 
post a $448,000 profit for this year's first half, compared with a net loss of 
$125,000 in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big winner in 1993 was Dolco Packaging Corp., a Sherman Oaks 
manufacturer of plastic packaging products. Its stock surged 157% to finish the 
year at $22.50 a share as its profits soared from several new products. For the 
nine months ended Sept. 30, Dolco's earnings more than doubled, to $2.9 
million, on an 8% increase in sales, to $46.2 million. A year earlier, the 
company earned $1.4 million on $42.6 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Two financial concerns, CU Bancorp and Foothill Group, were also among the top 
10 gainers. CU Bancorp's stock closed the year at $6.50 a share, double its 
price a year ago. The bank, which has been struggling from the effects of the 
recession, has refocused its attention on mid-sized business clients while 
reducing its non-performing real estate loans. As part of that strategy, CU 
sold its mortgage-banking division to Republic Bancorp of Ann Arbor, Mich., in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill Group saw its stock jump 96% last year to close at $16.63. The 
company, with dual headquarters in Agoura Hills and Los Angeles, is involved in 
commercial lending, invests in troubled companies and manages $650 million of 
other investors' money. Foothill recently spun off its thrift, which had been 
dragging down its profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The area's worst performing stock in 1993 was THQ Inc., a Calabasas video-game 
maker, whose stock fell 78% for the year and closed at 78 cents a share. THQ 
has been struggling with costs related to developing new products as well as 
having to increase its reserves for product markdowns and allowances. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local companies that lost considerable ground in the latest 12 months 
included Voice Powered Technology International Inc., a Canoga Park maker of 
voice-activated VCR programming devices that went public in 1992. 
Voice-Powered's stock sank 42% last year and closed 1993 at $4.44 a share. Last 
year Philips Consumer Electronics Corp., the giant Dutch electronics concern, 
agreed to market Voice Powered's VCR device under Philips' Magnavox brand. But 
profits have still been elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Voice Powered posted a third-quarter net loss of $3.1 million on sales of $2.2 
million. In the same period a year ago, Voice Powered posted a net loss of $1.3 
million on $237,000 of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Michael Bissonnette, founder of Voice Powered, stepped down as 
chief executive of the company. He was succeeded by Edward M. Krakauer, Voice 
Powered's chief operating officer since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But profits alone do not control the price of a stock. Among the poorest 
performing local stocks last year was Amgen Inc., the Thousand Oaks-based 
biotechnology concern, whose stock fell 30% to close 1993 at $49.50 a share. 
Even though analysts expect Amgen to earn a record profit of about $350 million 
for its fiscal 1993 year, most biotechnology stocks were hammered last year. 10

MAKING REALITY OUT OF IMAGES; TINY RKS DESIGN TURNS IDEAS INTO ATTRACTIVE, 
WORKABLE, CONSUMER-FRIENDLY PRODUCTS 
</P>

<P>
 What do designer dog food dishes, fetal monitoring systems and Teddy Ruxpin 
have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 A tiny industrial design firm based in Canoga Park, RKS Design. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1980 by former Xerox Corp. designer Ravi Sawhney, 37, RKS has 
worked for such big corporations as Rubbermaid Inc. and Sega of America, as 
well as entrepreneurs in fields ranging from health care to virtual-reality 
arcade games. 
</P>
<P>
 With just $1.2 million in revenue in 1993 and fees ranging from $5,000 to 
$300,000, RKS is part of a small but significant link in the product 
development chain. Across the country there are perhaps hundreds of mostly 
small firms specializing in taking the blueprints of corporate scientists and 
engineers and turning them into attractive, workable, consumer-friendly 
products. Their work is more in demand because the recession and corporate 
downsizing of the past few years has left many businesses without much of the 
in-house talent needed to create new products. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, competitive pressures are increasing to bring products to market 
more quickly. That means using more hired guns who can turn out workable 
product designs in shorter time spans. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, many product makers are turning to firms like RKS simply for a 
fresh point of view. "What often happens with technology," explained Sawhney, 
"is that without having some industrial designer on staff, some advocate of the 
consumer's position, it becomes engineered products developed by engineers for 
engineers." 
</P>
<P>
 Sawhney and his staff of eight, by contrast, try to inject the point of view 
of the buyer -- what Sawhney calls "the mother-in-law litmus test." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers come to RKS at various stages of conceptualizing new products. The 
design firm will produce elaborate drawings suggesting how the product might 
look and function. Those renderings -- usually a combination of 
computer-generated and hand-drawn designs -- lead to a series of models, then a 
prototype and manufacturing specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawhney founded RKS after leaving Xerox and striking out on his own as an 
industrial designer. First working out of his parents' Reseda house and helped 
by his wife, Bharti, a chemist, Sawhney slowly built a clientele of mostly 
local high-tech and medical companies. Bharti has since returned to teaching 
and RKS moved to its current location in 1983, where Sawhney built a 
custom-designed office and studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, RKS has worked on a surprisingly wide array of products. One of 
its first big breaks came in 1985, when RKS helped design the Teddy Ruxpin 
talking stuffed bear, which became one of the biggest-selling toys ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Worlds of Wonder Inc., then a new toy company with limited funds, needed a 
working prototype fast. RKS got the job in April; by the year's end, Teddy's 
sales reached $93 million. RKS shaved about $4 million from the manufacturing 
costs in that first year alone, Sawhney said, by designing a new eject 
mechanism for the bear doll's cassette tape. Yet RKS received only $50,000 for 
its work. Nonetheless, Sawhney was happy with the visibility it brought his 
young firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, RKS projects have included a fetal monitoring system for Tokos 
Medical Corp.; a computerized children's learning device for Apple Computer 
Inc.; a stereo speaker system for Harman International Industries Inc., and a 
system used by doctors to program pacemakers for Siemens Pacesetter Inc. RKS 
has also designed dog and cat bowls with rubber tabs on the bottom to prevent 
sliding, a spill-proof beverage container and a new exercise product for the 
makers of Thigh Master. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Schulz, vice president of marketing at MicroComputer Accessories Inc., a 
Rubbermaid Inc. subsidiary, said RKS is working with her company's designers to 
fashion a line of computer and office products. "Five or 10 years ago, the user 
was just looking for functionality," she said. "Today, design is becoming ever 
more important in the types of products we bring to market." 
</P>
<P>
 For a small firm like Norman Enterprises Inc., a Burbank maker of photographic 
equipment, outside design firms are needed to help turn engineers' ideas into 
practical models, said Al Williams, Norman's engineering manager. On a new 
Norman photographic lamp system, for instance, RKS suggested an easier-to-use 
latch and a way of housing the electronics in a small area that's easy to 
identify. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as opportunities for design firms are growing, so are the costs of 
the computer-aided design equipment they increasingly rely on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that you'd hire a designer, buy drawing boards and a few 
pencils," said Michael Nuttall, design director at IDEO Product Development in 
Palo Alto, one of the nation's largest industrial design companies with about 
170 employees. "Now when you hire new designers, you're looking at at least 
$50,000 in new equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Sawhney said he's determined to have the best technology, despite the cost. 
Three of RKS' four computer workstations are capable of creating 
three-dimensional models, which cuts the time needed to design a finished 
product to a fraction of what it takes using a standard 2-D system. Sawhney 
plans to add three more 3-D machines -- at $70,000 apiece. Many design firms 
still don't have 3-D computer modeling, but Sawhney believes "it's an 
investment you make if you're looking at growth." 
</P>
<P>
 RKS is also hoping to win jobs by offering a broad range of services. 
</P>
<P>
 One example of RKS' breadth of expertise, Sawhney said, came last year, when 
it designed equipment for a virtual-reality computer game for VR8, a Chatsworth 
start-up firm. These types of games are the new rage in interactive 
entertainment, but they typically involve heavy headgear that players wear to 
immerse themselves in a simulated, 3-D environment. 
</P>
<P>
 RKS tried to solve the problem of the cumbersome headsets by designing the 
helmet to be suspended from above and pivot easily as a player's head moves. 
Also, because VR8 wants to sell the game to arcades, where kids sometimes take 
out their frustrations on the equipment, RKS designers literally beat 
prototypes of the stainless-steel system with a baseball bat to ensure it would 
hold up to abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Another testament to RKS' success in diversifying, Sawhney said, is that the 
giant video-game maker Sega of America picked the firm to help develop a new 
interactive toy line. 
</P>
<P>
 For these toys, which are under wraps for the next few months, Sega wanted 
something strikingly different -- "cool stuff," said Wes Thomas, engineering 
manager for Sega's toy division. "But I don't have a group of industrial 
designers, nor do I have the time to hire a big research group to study and 
decide what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said he chose RKS because of its experience and cutting-edge designs. 
"A lot of design firms just put things out," he said. "They're in rut, they 
just have their signature look." 
</P>
<P>
 And many firms make beautiful renderings, he said, "but they really don't get 
the strategy. The thing that impresses me about RKS is they get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Sawhney's hope to compete with bigger, better-known design firms, he 
intends to limit RKS' growth. He sees revenues reaching $2 million within a 
year or two, and plans to add five more designers. But to get much bigger, he 
said, would mean sacrificing his personal involvement with clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawhney also will only occasionally accept equity positions in entrepreneurial 
companies or royalties instead of fees. Though he could have made a bundle if 
he'd had a stake in Teddy Ruxpin or other hot-selling products, he prefers to 
stay focused on what he loves best -- the design process.

 American Rocket Co., a Ventura firm that is developing a hybrid rocket motor, 
has taken another step in a long comeback following a failed rocket launch at 
Vandenberg Air Force Base that nearly destroyed the company in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The company heads a team that will receive $10.4 million from the Defense 
Department to build and launch an experimental space vehicle powered by 
American Rocket's H-1800 engine. The engine combines solid and liquid fuels to 
generate 250,000 pounds of thrust. The hybrid engine offers significant 
economic and safety advantages over conventional power systems, contends Paul 
Estey, American Rocket's president. 
</P>
<P>
 The award, part of the Clinton Administration's campaign to convert defense 
technology to new commercial products, calls for American Rocket and its fellow 
team members, Martin Marietta Corp. and United Technologies Corp., to 
contribute an additional $11.8 million, bringing the project's total cost to 
$22.2 million. Martin Marietta and United Technologies will concentrate on 
systems engineering for the space vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives us a tremendous boost," Estey said. "Aside from the financial 
impact, it means we've received an important vote of confidence from the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, 2,800 proposals have been made under the government's 
defense-conversion program, but Estey said his firm's proposal is one of only 
162 selected thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 American Rocket's unmanned suborbital spacecraft, called HyFlyer, is a project 
that the company hopes will lead to an orbiting vehicle that can be used for 
communications, weather forecasting, environmental monitoring and locating 
natural resources. Estey said the first rocket will be aloft for only about 10 
minutes before coming down in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Indicating that it may also have military applications, some personnel at 
Edwards and Vandenberg Air Force bases will work with the private concerns in 
developing HyFlyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The rocket is scheduled to be launched in March, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Estey said American Rocket expects to double its current payroll of 25 during 
1994. Prior to the 1989 mishap, American Rocket had 130 employees. However, 
after the fire on the launch pad, the payroll fell to only 20 and the company 
moved from Camarillo to a smaller plant on Ralston Street in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Estey said he is not sure how American Rocket will raise its share of the 
$11.8 million that must be contributed by the development team. "We're 
considering several possibilities, such as issuing new stock, borrowing and 
taking on a partner," he said.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: HIGH RAILROAD RATES CITED AS SHIPMENTS END

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cool Carriers Inc., which has imported Australian meat through the Port of 
Hueneme for the past 1 1/2 years, will discontinue the shipments Jan. 25 
because rail shipping costs have risen sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Fountain, Cool Carriers' president, says Southern Pacific railroad 
rates from Ventura County to the East Coast increased more than 35% during 
1993. He said his firm has been unloading two shiploads of meat monthly in Port 
Hueneme -- adding an estimated $2.5 million annually to the county's economy -- 
then shipping the meat for sale on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Port officials hope to find another carrier to import Australian meat through 
the port.

 Hudson's Grill of America Inc., the Ventura-based restaurant chain that was 
sold to a Texas entrepreneur over the summer, has sold four of its units to a 
family-owned investment group for $2.9 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, headed by William and Gregory Georgas, purchased the chain's 
restaurants in Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurants will operate as franchises of Hudson's Grill of America, which 
was purchased in August by Davis L. Osborn of Dallas. He plans to sell all 13 
restaurants that he acquired and to concentrate on franchising the Hudson's 
Grill concept.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: PROCTER & GAMBLE PLANT MANAGER RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The manager of Procter & Gamble's Oxnard plant has resigned unexpectedly and 
will probably be replaced this month, a company spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton Sherman, who headed the Procter & Gamble Paper Products Co. facility 
for three years, left last month without warning, "but I have no reason to 
believe it wasn't voluntary," spokesman Robert Paulger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulger said he had no idea of Sherman's future plans. "All I know is that we 
received an announcement that he was resigning. But that isn't unusual. In a 
company this size, people come and go." 
</P>
<P>
 During Sherman's tenure, employment at the plant rose to 600 from 380. The 
plant makes toilet paper and napkins. A soon-to-be-completed expansion program 
saw a second paper-making machine installed at a cost of $150 million.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: COSTS, REVENUES ARE BEING TRIMMED AT GTE

<TEXT>
<P>
 GTE California, based in Thousand Oaks, is in the midst of a cost-cutting 
program, and the company has announced that its revenues, too, are being 
reduced.The reduction, mandated by the state Public Utilities Commission, will 
cut $100 million from the firm's residential telephone income. 
</P>
<P>
 That amounts to a savings of $1.30 a month for the average residential 
customer. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings will show up on customers' bills beginning this month as credits 
of 5.66% on local service and 5.35% on toll calls. Long-distance companies will 
also get a reduction on charges they pay GTE for access to its customers.

BOND, STOCK PRICES FALL; SILVER SOARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * Treasury market participants rang in the new year on a sour 
note Monday, pushing long-term bond yields to nearly five-month highs and 
pushing down prices more than a point. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks ended mostly lower in quiet trading, although blue-chip issues 
managed a late advance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Silver futures prices soared to a five-month high, reflecting growing 
optimism about the economy and future industrial demand for the metal. Gold 
also rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit  
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by fresh signs of economic growth, the powerful rise in long-term 
yields suggested the market was more worried than many had expected about the 
continued improvement in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices fall in good times because of the likelihood of higher interest 
rates and inflation, both of which depress the value of fixed-income 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The yields on the Treasury's main 30-year bond shot up to 6.42% from 6.34% on 
Friday. The last time the bond's yield was this high was Aug. 12, when it 
closed at 6.44%. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, plunged 1 
1/16 points, or $10.63 per $1,000 in face value.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the fifth bond price decline in six sessions. Sellers who had sat out 
last week's thinly traded holiday market joined the fray Monday, pushing prices 
sharply lower from the outset of trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The price tumble accelerated with the midmorning release of two economic 
reports that support the view of a growing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Purchasing Management said its monthly survey shows 
continued expansion in the manufacturing sector in December. The group's 
monthly index of manufacturing activity registered a steeper than expected 
57.9% in December, up from 55.7% the previous month and the third consecutive 
month of growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also reported that construction spending rose 1.8% in November 
for the seventh consecutive monthly advance. The increase was a bit stronger 
than what many analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports added to concern among fixed-income investors that the Federal 
Reserve Board will nudge short-term interest rates higher in the first half of 
the year as a way to control nascent inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment has depressed bond prices in recent months, because higher 
rates on new securities would depress the value of bonds already sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook for the rest of this week was seen as holding little room for 
improvement in bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its employment report 
for December. Economists expect that the economy gained about 220,000 non-farm 
payroll jobs last month, another signal that the recovery accelerated last 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're looking for something positive for the bond market, it is tough to 
find," said Jim Kenney, head government securities trader at Prudential 
Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term Treasury securities fell 1/8 point to 7/32 point and intermediate 
maturities were off 13/32 point to 13/16 point, the Telerate Inc. financial 
information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Stocks spent much of the session firmly lower, but they recovered slightly 
late in the day when the Dow skipped to its narrow advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil shares helped buoy blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller company stocks, which last week ran up in value, were among those hit 
hardest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.51 points to 3,756.60 on Big Board 
volume totaling 279.25 million shares, up from Friday's 171.39 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances about 3 to 2 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising long-term bond yields hurt the stock market, said Don Hays, an 
investment strategist at Wheat First-Butcher & Singer. Stocks and bonds have 
often moved in tandem recently because low interest rates make shares more 
appealing and cut the cost of money to companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, however, investors were waiting to see which way the market would 
move, said James Melcher, founder and president of Balestra Capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a lot of uncertainty at the beginning of the year," Melcher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Concern about inflation pushed gold stocks higher. Gold is often considered 
a hedge against inflation. Sunshine Mining led the NYSE most-active list, 
rising 1/2 to 3 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil stocks moved higher after news that the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries is considering bringing forward its scheduled March 25 
meeting. Chevron rose 7/8 to 88. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among other actively traded NYSE issues, Federated Department Stores rose 2 
to 22 3/4 after the company bought a stake in R.H. Macy & Co. for $449 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telefonos de Mexico lost 2 to 65 1/2 amid reports that 57 people had been 
killed in an Indian uprising in southern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among technology stocks on the Nasdaq market, Intel fell 3/4 to 61 1/4, 
Microsoft dropped 1/2 to 80 1/8, Lotus Development shed 1 1/2 to 53 1/2, Cisco 
Systems lost 3/8 to 64 1/4 and Oracle Systems lost 1/4 to 28 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Toys R Us fell 7/8 to 40 after the company said Michael Goldstein, the toy 
retailer's vice chairman, was named chief executive, succeeding Charles 
Lazarus. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares ended higher abroad, although markets were closed in Tokyo and London. 
In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 share average closed up 1.3 points at 2,267.98. On the 
Paris bourse, the CAC-40 index closed nearly 1% higher after a lackluster 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts could cite no single dominant reason for silver's mighty move but 
agreed that the strengthening economy and accompanying fears of inflation 
contributed to it. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Comex, silver for current delivery closed at $5.220 an ounce, 
up 13.3 cents from Thursday. The British metals market was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold for current delivery closed at $393.70 an ounce, up $2.90 from Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stronger crude oil prices also fueled inflation fears and buying of precious 
metals, said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude futures climbed on the New York Merc on talk that OPEC might move up its 
scheduled March meeting to late January or early February. 
</P>
<P>
 February light, sweet crude oil rose 39 cents to $14.56 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the dollar rose against most currencies.

STARS, STRIPES -- AND SOCCER? WORLD CUP FANS CRY FOUL; YES, THE EARTH'S MOST 
REVERED SPORT IS COMING TO A COUNTRY THAT SHUNS IT. THE REASONS ADD UP TO 
BILLIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Talk about the ultimate punishment!  
</P>
<P>
 It was 1990, Italy was hosting the World Cup soccer championships, and an 
Italian judge had before him an avid fan convicted of hooliganism during an 
Italian league match. The sentence: Silence. No talking about soccer for the 
duration of the quadrennial tournament that regularly captures the globe's 
biggest sporting audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rip out my heart! Sacrifice my offspring! But not this!" 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup.  
</P>
<P>
 It was her country's loss to Austria in the 1978 World Cup that drove a young 
West Berlin woman to leap from her apartment window shouting: "I don't want to 
live any more!" 
</P>
<P>
 During that same game, a man in a Frankfurt restaurant tried to strangle 
another diner who was cheering for the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years later, when the tournament finals moved to Mexico, a Colombian man 
became so enraged when his wife turned off the TV set during the middle of a 
game that he shot her. He turned the set back on, watched the rest of the 
match, then called police to turn himself in. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States may be preoccupied with sports, but nothing here rivals the 
place soccer holds in the global society. In many countries, it is the social 
fabric that knits disparate classes and groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * By winning the 1990 World Cup, West Germany united East and West in ways 
that the fall of the Belin Wall could not.  
</P>
<P>
 * Bolivia's qualification for the upcoming 1994 World Cup tournament, to be 
held in the United States, set off a national hysteria that is only now abating 
in the tiny landlocked Andean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * When Bulgaria squared off against France in Paris for a World Cup qualifying 
spot in November, Bulgarian Parliament members postponed a crucial ratification 
vote on a new government so they could watch the game on television. 
</P>
<P>
 * Argentina's former president, Carlos Saul Menem, so persistently insinuated 
himself into public appearances with Argentina's wildly popular national team 
that players began rolling their eyes when Menem appeared. Diego Maradona, the 
team's temperamental star, seemed to take great delight in keeping the 
country's chief executive waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pope John Paul II -- a pretty fair goalkeeper in his youth in Poland -- 
happily blessed the refurbished Olympic Stadium in Rome for the 1990 World Cup. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Of five most-watched sports events in television history, four are soccer 
matches. That 1990 final in Rome leads the list with a worldwide audience of 
more than one billion people in 167 countries.  
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of millions tune in just for the World Cup Draw -- a boring bit of 
housekeeping in which Ping-Pong balls representing nations are drawn from bowls 
and arranged into competition groups.  
</P>
<P>
 So why, oh why, soccer purists ask, did the sport's governing body award its 
most revered prize to a country with a reputation as the sport's Siberia? How 
could the Federation International de Football, or FIFA, so desecrate the World 
Cup, this glittering spectacle, by allowing it to be staged by the Americans, 
who have again and again shown their barbarity. Who don't even play 
professional soccer, for heaven's sake!  
</P>
<P>
 For generations, Americans have given the sport the back of their 
ticket-buying hands. An alphabet soup of professional leagues have come and 
gone -- the NASL, the MISL, the APSL, the MSL, the CISL the USISL. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, the World Cup will be held in nine U.S. cities in a monthlong 
tournament climaxing with the July 17 championship game at the Rose Bowl in 
Pasadena. Yet with only six months to go before the playoffs begin, only 13% of 
Americans surveyed in a recent poll were even aware their country would be 
hosting the event. 
</P>
<P>
 So what did FIFA have in mind? 
</P>
<P>
 One key is clearly that the World Cup is Very Big Business. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 affair in Italy generated $8 billion in revenue. And, as FIFA is well 
aware, the Americans have proven adept at organizing well-run and financially 
successful mega-events. (Remember the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and their $250 
million surplus?) 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA is gambling that by placing the World Cup finals in the United States, it 
can tap into the seemingly bottomless vats of money possessed by American 
television networks, sports sponsors and marketeers. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, while they may not emulate more soccer-crazed nations by halting 
virtually every other form of human activity during the World Cup, the 
Americans have shown that they're trying. Consider, for example, the 
Silverdome. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionalists blanched when it was announced that some games would be played 
at the indoor arena in Pontiac, Mich. Never before had a World Cup game been 
played indoors. Those Americans had clearly let their ignorance about soccer 
trip them up this time -- FIFA refuses to sanction matches played on anything 
other than natural grass. And everyone knows grass can't grow indoors, they 
said; only that ghastly bright green plastic turf can thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 But a team of khaki-clad agronomists sprang into action. A hybrid of three 
types of turf was formulated and tested with great success last summer. The 
grass lived for two weeks under its fiberglass sky.  
</P>
<P>
 Lest it get unduly scuffed, the grass was removed from the arena. So, resting 
on wooden pallets in a parking lot in suburban Detroit, the Silverdome's field 
lies sleeping for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the business about hooligans. 
</P>
<P>
 England, with its reputation for having perhaps Europe's most unruly soccer 
fans, failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. But the Netherlands, whose fans 
may rank a close second to England's, has qualified.  
</P>
<P>
 When a U.S. security official tried to allay global concerns about 
hooliganism, however, his efforts went awry.  
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining that American police officers can handle anything hooligans have 
to offer, the official added: "If the police can't hold them, we'll put them up 
against our gangs in South Central L.A. The gangs will win, hands down." 
</P>
<P>
 The security expert was puzzled when Europeans, already appalled by this 
country's gun culture, were not reassured.

FADS, FASHION AND FOOLERY FOR 1994 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weighty matters will transpire in 1994, statistics and experience insist. Many 
will be important, some genuinely interesting; a few truly readable. It is the 
challenge of a good newspaper to chronicle them: Dogs bark at strangers, don't 
they? 
</P>
<P>
 As your life hurtles along in tandem with momentous events in the new year, 
though, it's probably not a bad idea to keep news in perspective. Mites often 
affect the way you live and what you think more than Mighties. 
</P>
<P>
 Fads, fashions and frivolity -- sex, saris and soccer -- may not often sup on 
Page One with war, revolution and market-moving affairs of state and commerce. 
But who is to deny them a place at the table? 
</P>
<P>
 Not, surely, a keen-eyed team of foreign correspondents who, with equal elan, 
can imbibe Issues of Our Time and Junk Worth Knowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year home-grown events, people, ideas and issues excite interest in 
individual countries without necessarily awakening international echo. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows then, a New Year's appetizer, is a sampling of foolery and 
flotsam -- an eclectic collection of who's in, what's out and what to look for 
in '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the antipasti will probably not make many appearances on American 
plates. But one dish -- the 1994 World Cup -- will rivet international 
attention and clog Pasadena arteries as the most-discussed, most-watched 
spectacle in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Safer to dismiss are some dainties on the haircut 'n hemline circuit: Japan is 
anxious for a royal pregnancy but German wags have already named the unborn 
child of a tennis star and his American bride. The Year of the Dog will be 
bowing in China the same month that samba dancers are wowing Brazil in another 
"shine in fantasy" Carnevale. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedding of the year is the British Isles to the continent, with the new 
Channel Tunnel as best man. But beware if you go to the reception. Food may 
become edible bat about the same point the waiter starts snarling if you 
mispronounce the soup du jour.  
</P>
<P>
 One nation grappling with an uncertain future, Russia, must also decide how to 
literally lay its past to rest. Another, Pakistan, is consumed by a feud among 
members of its most prominent family. The arrival of television commercials and 
a plethora of official languages strike minor chords amid big news in Israel 
and South Africa, while Mexicans who work to NAFTA are learning to dance to the 
equally new-fangled quebradita.  
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, simplicity and honesty are ideas whose time has come to '94 
Italy. Design is moving away from hyper-decorative; one designer has even been 
heard to opine that the brain counts more than the dress. Probity, after two 
revelatory years of unprecedented scandal, seems a daring new idea: Will 
zealous Milan magistrates uncover an honest politician? 
</P>
<P>
 When some guileless Neopolitan actually drives down a one-way street the right 
way, it might even mark microcosmic Italian witness to that elusive juncture of 
froth and substance that makes the world go round. WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO

 NEXT, THE BATTLING BHUTTOS: Britain has its royals -- and Pakistan has the 
Bhuttos. Both families, no doubt, will generate their share of gossip in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her estranged mother, Nusrat, have been 
feuding over which of them is the rightful chairwoman of the ruling Pakistan 
People's Party. Nusrat is also said to generally favor her son -- Benazir's 
younger brother, Murtaza Bhutto.  
</P>
<P>
 Will 1994 see a reconciliation between Benazir and her mom? Last month, the 
prime minister gave Nusrat a public buss when both showed up for the laying of 
a foundation stone at a child care center in Karachi. But that didn't signal 
the end of the feud, most believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, maybe politics Pakistan-style has more in common with the 
Hollywood hit "Ghost." As UCLA Prof. Stanley Wolpert notes in his recent 
biography of clan founder and former Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali 
Bhutto, there is a persistent belief among millions of Pakistanis that the 
charismatic Bhutto was, after all, not hanged at the hands of Gen. Zia ul-Haq 
on April 4, 1979 -- that he never died.

<P>

 HURRAY FOR: Hollywood in Hong Kong? 
</P>
<P>
 Three years before this British dependency is to revert to Chinese rule, it is 
about to get a large dose of U.S.-style movie mania with the opening sometime 
this year of a Planet Hollywood restaurant.The chain, owned by movie stars 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis, features a film 
memorabilia motif and already includes seven other restaurants in the United 
States, Britain and Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hong Kong outlet is just one part of a massive strategic plan aimed at 
turning Canton Road, located within a 3 1/2-square-mile shopping area at the 
tip of the colony's Kowloon Peninsula, into something like New York's West 57th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel Properties Ltd., the Singapore-based firm which holds the franchise for 
Planet Hollywood, also plans to open a Hard Rock Cafe on Canton Road sometime 
next year. CHRISTINE COURTNEY

 DOG DAYS IN BEIJING: The Chinese will bid farewell to the Year of the Rooster 
and usher in the Year of the Dog at the start of the Spring Festival on Feb. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 China's dizzying economic growth made the Year of the Rooster well worth 
crowing about.The biggest tale in the Year of the Dog is likely to be the 
precarious health of China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
 Deng turns 90 on Aug. 22, having outlived Mao, Chou En-lai, Marshal Chu Teh 
and most of the other leaders present at the founding of the People's Republic 
in 1949. Deng's only remaining official title is chairman of the All China 
Bridge Assn. But his influence remains vast in a land that never lost its taste 
for dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 Although superstition remains officially banned in the People's Republic, most 
still believe that in the Chinese context, mortal milestones, natural disasters 
and dynastic change often occur in series. In the Year of the Dragon, 1975-76, 
for example, China witnessed a meteor shower, the deaths of Chou, Chu and Mao, 
and the Tangshan earthquake east of Beijing that killed as many as half a 
million people. The Chinese people took it all as an omen. Deng seized the 
auspicious moment to defeat the Gang of Four and end the 10-year Cultural 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 In the battle for succession after Deng's death, you can be sure that the 
Chinese Communist government will be watching each raindrop and earth tremor 
lest they be interpreted as a sign of an impending change of regime. RONE 
TEMPEST

 STRANGE BEDFELLOWS: If history cooks up another of its convenient milestones, 
two men whose lives and deaths were inextricably linked in the stormy history 
of 20th-Century Russia -- Czar Nicholas II and Vladimir I. Lenin -- may both be 
given a decent burial this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last July, when scientists proved (more or less) a bunch of bones found 
in a shallow grave in the woods of western Siberia to be those of the doomed 
Last Czar and at least part of his family, royal descendants and other White 
Russian nobility have urged authorities to give them a decent burial. 
</P>
<P>
 When and if a government commission formed to look into the matter decides the 
scientists are right -- and discussions at the commission are less than 
peaceful -- Czar Nicholas and his family will be entombed alongside their 
ancestors in St. Petersburg's St. Peter and Paul fortress. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickled body of Lenin, who emerged in 1917 as Czar Nicholas' chief rival 
and the next year became his indirect executioner, has been the focus for 
obligatory Communist pilgrimages to Red Square for decades. Now, influential 
voices from the mayor of Moscow to officials of the Russian Orthodox Church say 
that he, too, should be interred in St. Petersburg, the city that for a 
relatively brief but unforgettable spell -- as Leningrad -- was named after 
him, and where his mother is already buried. RICHARD BOUDREAUX

 PASS THE SALSA: The Latin dance-to-know for 1994 comes not from the steamy 
Caribbean or pulsating Brazil but from tradition-bound Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 La quebradita -- literally, the little breach -- has swept down from the 
border states into the night clubs of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 A cross between the lambada and the Mexican polka, the dance is a precarious 
combination of fast-paced and suggestive. Partners lock themselves in an 
embrace resembling a death grip while their intertwined legs move swiftly to a 
salsa-fied oom-pah beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the tango, la quebradita springs from humble origins: It first appeared 
here in bars such as El Pacifico, where soldiers and minor drug dealers from 
northeastern Mexico mix with wide-eyed urban secretaries, and a Saturday night 
is hardly complete without a stabbing or at least a brandished pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 By this holiday season, la quebradita had infiltrated the most respectable 
corporate seasonal dinner-dances -- although it should be noted that many 
carefully coifed clerks and office managers, who had gracefully segued from 
mambo to cumbia throughout the evening, watched the prancing movements with 
puzzlement. JUANITA DARLING

 THOSE DARN COMMERCIALS: Life here will never be the same, if you believe the 
doomsayers. No -- they're not talking about peace talks between Israel and the 
Palestinians.It's TV commercials that have got them astir. 
</P>
<P>
 "An irreversible plunge into consumerism," one social commentator said. "An 
all-out onslaught on what remains of our sensibilities," added another critic. 
"We will have Michael Jackson dancing into our homes for Pepsi." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 25 years after television came to Israel, many viewers of state-run 
Israel Television are only now getting their first taste of real commercials as 
opposed to "public service announcements," such as those urging Israelis to fly 
the national airline. 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, state television for the first time faces real competition 
this year from a full-fledged commercial rival that, for want of a better name, 
is called New Channel 2. Previously broadcasting only experimentally, the new 
station will be battling seriously for the 1994 television audience, counting 
on novelty and the promise of more entertainment to give it an edge.  
</P>
<P>
 The New Channel 2's impact is already noticeable: 
</P>
<P>
 * A struggling evening newspaper closed in anticipation that much of its 
advertising would go to television. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dinner hour and children's bedtimes were changed at many households to 
accommodate a nightly newscast brought forward for competitive reasons by 
Israel Television. 
</P>
<P>
 * Several prominent rabbis have issued religious injunctions against watching 
"pornographic" advertisements on the commercial channel, where in-house censors 
admit to being troubled by the degree that sex is used to sell products.

 TOWER OF BABBLE: One of the many unanswered questions about South Africa's 
transition to black majority rule after the first democratic elections next 
April 27 is fairly basic: How will people communicate? 
</P>
<P>
 According to its interim constitution, the new South Africa will have no fewer 
than 11 official languages.In addition to English and Afrikaans, "wherever 
possible, a person shall have the right to use and to be addressed in his or 
her dealings with all public administrations at the national level" in any or 
all of the following traditional African tongues: siNdebele, sePedi, seSotho, 
siSwati, xiTsonga, seTswana, luVenda, siXhosa and siZulu. 
</P>
<P>
 And just in case 11 aren't enough, the constitution authorizes creation of a 
Pan South African Language Board. Among its duties: "Promoting respect for and 
the development of Greek, Gujerati, Hindi, Portuguese, Tamil, Telegu, Urdu and 
other languages used by communities in South Africa, as well as Arabic and 
Hebrew and other languages used for religious purposes."  
</P>
<P>
 James Clark, a columnist for the Star newspaper, warns -- tongue in cheek -- 
of problems ahead. Each stop sign, he wrote, presumably must be written in all 
11 languages -- "which works out at 44 words painted at each intersection and 
44 metal signs. The various translations of 'stop street ahead' will have to 
begin 3 kilometers from the actual stop street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like the Golden Gate Bridge," he added, "each intersection will need a 
permanent team of painters working ceaselessly." BOB DROGIN

 BEAUTY OF A CAR RACE: The annual Polish Journalists Car Rally, for 20 years an 
excuse for male reporters and editors to screech through mountain passes and 
cobblestone streets, is expanding this year for the first time to include a 
women's race. 
</P>
<P>
 And all eyes are on the early favorite: Ewa Wachowicz, a 23-year-old beauty 
queen who recently began doubling as press secretary to Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak. 
</P>
<P>
 The reigning "Student Miss Universe" and former "Miss Poland," Wachowicz has 
taken her share of ridicule since joining the new prime minister's inner 
circle. She acknowledges knowing little about politics, and she must still 
fulfill her beauty title obligations -- including numerous public appearances 
-- while serving as press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 A mocking Polish press corps quickly concocted a fictional government 
information telephone number composed of Wachowicz's measurements expressed in 
centimeters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the green-eyed farmer's daughter may get the last laugh.  
</P>
<P>
 A sports enthusiast, Wachowicz has mastered jogging, skiing and gliding -- 
and, most important, is said to be an accomplished amateur driver. She is 
expected to enter the eight-part journalists' elimination rally, beginning in 
February, with her new Opel Astra. 
</P>
<P>
 "She may just win it," predicted a confidant Przemyslaw Osuchowski, a former 
newspaper reporter who recently quit his job to become Wachowicz's assistant.

 GETTING A NEW WRAP: What could be more quintessentially Indian than the sari, 
the 18-foot (and longer) swath of brilliantly hued, unstitched cloth in which 
hundreds of millions of women on the Subcontinent carefully wrap themselves 
each morning?  
</P>
<P>
 But not in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 In a trend that tells much about shifting attitudes toward tradition and 
womanhood here, saris are plummeting in popularity as the everyday wear of 
university students and young women professionals. "Traditionalism at some 
level is out," said Ritu Bhatia, New Delhi editorial representative of the 
glossy magazine Femina, which targets India's "woman of substance." These days, 
Bhatia said, "there's a lot more choice, and people are looking for something 
different."  
</P>
<P>
 International couturiers, lured by the country's liberalized rules on foreign 
investment, are flocking in. Arrow and Lacoste shirts have begun advertising in 
the homeland of the Nehru jacket, and in March, Pierre Cardin Pvt Ltd. is 
scheduled to set up exclusive stores in Delhi, Bombay, Pune, Calcutta, 
Bangalore and Goa.  
</P>
<P>
 Fashion experts say 1994 will also see a return to alternative, albeit 
home-bred sartorial styles, including the Rajasthani ghagra (an ankle-length 
skirt that ties at the waist with a drawstring and is worn with a blouse called 
the choli ) , and from northern India, the salwar kamiz (a long 
night-shirt-like garment coupled with baggy pants).  
</P>
<P>
 Bhatia adds that the sari, like the kimono in Japan, will remain de rigueur 
for certain social occasions. JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG

 GETTING IT ON PAPER: The passports have been printed in Switzerland, a gift of 
the Swiss government. The drivers licenses and identity cards are being done 
locally, green ink on white paper.And the new currency, the Palestinian pound, 
has already been designed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Palestinians are getting ready not only for autonomy this year under the 
agreement between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel but for the 
independent state they hope will follow on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it take to make a country?" joked Adnan abu Humeid, a West Bank 
businessman. "There are some states that are not much more than a telephone 
code, a soccer team, an airline. . . . I'm sure we'll have all that and more by 
July."

 PARTY-HEARTY CROWD: For a few frenzied days in mid-February, the Brazilian 
capital will put aside its problems and make believe it really is the carefree 
urban playground of its erstwhile international image.  
</P>
<P>
 Rio's crime, poverty, corruption, congestion and pollution will not matter as 
the tropical metropolis transcends itself in the euphoria of its famous 
pre-Lenten Carnavale.Samba clubs will parade in the Sapucai (or "sambadrome") 
to the sounds of songs written just for this year's extravaganza -- songs of 
fantasy and frivolity, poetry and joy. Many of them will include gushing 
tributes to the chaotic but charming city.

 "Oh! Rio

 WHAT ABOUT 'BOBS'? Anyone familiar with the German obsession for politics 
would think there is nothing that could have more news value in 1994 than the 
19 national and regional elections planned for the Fatherland.  
</P>
<P>
 Nothing except "Bobs," that is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobs" is the name this nation's boulevard press has already given to the 
eagerly awaited first child of recently married tennis star Boris Becker and 
his German-American bride, Barbara Feltus. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the expectant parents have yet to choose a name for their baby -- 
scheduled to arrive in mid-January. But that didn't stop some clever headline 
writer who combined parts of the parents' first names to come up with "Bobs." 
When Barbara recently let slip she was expecting a girl, the German media 
simply added an "i" and continued gushing about "Bobsi". 
</P>
<P>
 For the 26-year-old former Wimbledon champion, the birth will be a pleasant 
diversion from his tennis game, which has been in the doldrums for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm only thinking baby, baby, baby," admitted Becker recently after crashing 
out of the Grand Slam Cup in Munich in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's playing as if he's the one who's pregnant," quipped German Olympic 
swimmer Franziska van Almsick. TYLER MARSHALL

 CANADA GOES VEGAS: Can the United States save Canadian football? The question 
moves to Nevada come July, when the Las Vegas Posse joins the Canadian Football 
League.  
</P>
<P>
 The beleaguered CFL sees continued expansion into the United States as 
essential for its survival and for the survival of Canadian football as a 
distinct -- and, purists insist, an intrinsically superior -- sport.The 
Canadian field is bigger, and the game has three downs instead of four, so 
there is a lot more passing, action and risk-taking than in American football. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Canadian league is plagued by a serious imbalance in team 
quality. Also, Canadians enjoy easy access to American games via international 
cable and satellite television. While they prefer the Canadian rules, they say, 
they watch American games because there are more teams and the games are more 
evenly matched and exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 While it has no ambitions of competing against the National Football League, 
the CFL has decided to add teams in enemy territory (i.e., the United States) 
by focusing on second-tier American cities where, officials hope, uncommitted 
sports fans will start cheering for the local CFL franchises.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the CFL's Gold Miners played their first game in Sacramento, and this 
year the newborn Posse will play home games in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The CFL's plans for survival have not been without criticism in Canada. 
Canadian football purists worry that, if the gambit is too successful, there 
will eventually be more CFL teams in the United States than there are in 
Canada. MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 PUSHING OUT PUSHINESS: The Singapore government, which has often been compared 
to a nanny because of the way it seeks to eliminate what it sees as bad 
behavior, like chewing gum, is taking on a new target in the new year: kiasu.  
</P>
<P>
 Kiasu is a slang word that, roughly translated, means "fear of losing out."It 
denotes a certain assertiveness that used to be encouraged, especially in 
business. But, kiasu has gotten out of control, and now the government wants to 
put a lid on it.  
</P>
<P>
 In practice, people have come to use kiasu to justify outrageous behavior, 
such as refusing to wait in lines and pushing old ladies out of the way on the 
subway to get a seat. The government has started campaigning against kiasu 
drivers -- road hogs in huge new Mercedes who will steal a parking place at the 
drop of a hat.  
</P>
<P>
 One fast food chain recently introduced a line of kiasu dolls as a humorous 
giveaway promotion, but the idea was quickly dropped after a number of senior 
officials wrote negative letters to the newspapers about what terrible role 
models they make. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's answer to all these pushy people? A radio and television 
campaign to make people be more polite. But it's likely to prove a lot harder 
than getting people to stop chewing gum. CHARLES WALLACE

 FORMER SOVIET UNION 
</P>
<P>
 Upheaval in Russia: The birth pangs of Russian democracy were accompanied by 
bloodshed in 1993. In December, the nation held its first multi-party elections 
since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. But two months earlier, Moscow witnessed 
the fiercest unrest it had seen since the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict at the heart of the year's events was between President Boris N. 
Yeltsin's camp and hard-line members of the Soviet-era Parliament opposed to 
his economic reforms. Their animosity was so great that in December, 1992, 
Yeltsin had called for a national referendum in the spring to decide whether he 
or the lawmakers should be forced to resign. He backed away from that proposal 
in February -- urging "a year of moratorium on all political fistfighting" -- 
but then he dropped a bombshell in March. In a nationally televised address, 
Yeltsin declared that he was assuming temporary power to rule by decree. He 
also announced an April 25 referendum asking voters to endorse both his 
leadership and a law to elect a new Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event, Yeltsin's arrogation of power was ruled unconstitutional and he 
backed off yet again, narrowly avoiding impeachment. Then, in April, voters did 
indeed turn out to express their support for both him and his pro-market 
economic policies. However, although turnout was higher than expected at more 
than 60%, it was nowhere near enough to allow for the possibility of a vote 
forcing renewal of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 On May Day, the discord in the air crystallized in Moscow, where Communists 
marching on labor's traditional holiday clashed with police in a prolonged 
melee of flying bricks and swinging truncheons that left more than 200 people 
injured. But it was in September that all hell broke loose. As Parliament 
continued to resist his reforms, Yeltsin ordered it dissolved and called new 
parliamentary elections. In response, the deputies named Vice President 
Alexander V. Rutskoi acting president and impeached Yeltsin, and many of them 
barricaded themselves inside the White House -- the legislative headquarters. 
There they remained for nearly two weeks, until, in early October, their armed 
supporters attacked the Moscow mayor's office and the state television 
broadcasting center. That prompted Yeltsin to call in the army on Oct. 4 to 
shell the White House with tanks, crushing the rebellion. At least 140 people 
are thought to have died in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Yeltsin outlined a draft constitution strengthening presidential 
power to be put to voters electing a new Parliament on Dec. 12. And the 
document did win their approval. The bad news was the startling support -- 
roughly a quarter of the vote -- that the misleadingly named Liberal Democratic 
Party drew in the election. The party's leader, Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, is a 
defiant ultranationalist widely characterized as a fascist and an anti-Semite. 
</P>
<P>
 Concession in Ukraine: After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Ukraine gave its 
battlefield nuclear weapons back to Russia. But it retained a 1,800-warhead 
nuclear arsenal that it has refused to return -- although its Rada, or 
Parliament, ratified the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Talks treaty in October. 
Part of the problem has been the issue of compensation: When the Rada approved 
the START treaty, it appended 13 separate conditions demanding up to $2.8 
billion -- a figure the West has rejected as too high. Under increased pressure 
from Washington and Moscow, however, the nation disclosed in December that it 
is dismantling some of the most sophisticated weapons in that arsenal -- 20 of 
46 Soviet-made SS-24 missiles. U.S. arms-control experts said the decision was 
significant because the missiles are so potent and because the step -- ordered 
by President Leonid Kravchuk -- came over the objections of some Ukrainian 
military officers and members of Parliament. Nevertheless, analysts noted that 
the action still leaves Ukraine with 26 SS-24s carrying a total of 260 nuclear 
warheads. That's more than either Britain or France. MIDEAST 
</P>
<P>
 Peace Prospects in Israel: A handshake. That was the defining image as on 
Sept. 13, on the South Lawn of the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat -- urged on 
by President Clinton -- reached out to each other to acknowledge a 
precedent-shattering peace agreement. The so-called Declaration of Principles 
had been worked out by Israeli officials in clandestine meetings over the 
preceding eight months with PLO representatives in Cairo and some European 
capitals -- notably Oslo, where Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst 
was instrumental in helping the two sides bridge their differences. The accords 
laid the groundwork for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip 
and the West Bank town of Jericho, to be followed by the transfer of 
administration of those areas to an elected Palestinian government. 
</P>
<P>
 The year's path toward peace began in Israel in January, when the Knesset, or 
Parliament, officially authorized contacts between the government and the PLO. 
That move came despite continuing tension spurred by Rabin's decision the month 
before to deport more than 400 suspected Muslim militants to a no-man's-land in 
southern Lebanon, where most remained even as the peace accords were signed. In 
late July, officials' attention was diverted when the nation launched a 
weeklong military offensive, dubbed "Operation Accountability," against 
Iranian-backed militants in southern Lebanon. Lebanese authorities said 500,000 
people were driven from their homes by that operation -- which ended with an 
Israeli cease-fire agreement with Lebanon and neighboring Syria negotiated by 
the United States. And although Israeli troops were scheduled to begin leaving 
the occupied territories in mid-December, that date passed without the two 
sides having settled the terms of the withdrawal, even as attacks and 
counterattacks continued involving Palestinians and Israeli settlers opposed to 
the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the signing of the accords in September was followed almost immediately 
by a "framework" agreement between Israel and Jordan, laying the foundation for 
a treaty that would officially end the 1967 Six-Day War. In December, Syrian 
President Hafez Assad made a number of conciliatory moves toward Israel; the 
deportees who had been languishing in southern Lebanon were allowed to return 
home, and negotiators for the Vatican and Israel ratified an agreement to 
establish full diplomatic relations. Hope for peace was still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing Terror in Egypt: Tourism brings Egypt an estimated $3 billion 
annually, but the year marked the second in a row that Islamic extremists 
seemed intent on torpedoing it. A case in point: In March, a bomb exploded in a 
crowded coffeehouse in Cairo's central square, killing four -- including two 
foreigners -- and wounding 15 others, among them two Americans. Senior 
government officials were also targeted in the wave of terrorism. Prime 
Minister Atef Sedki, for one, was on his way to work in November when a bomb 
exploded outside his house just after his motorcade had passed. Sedki was 
unharmed, but the blast killed a teen-age girl at a nearby school and wounded 
at least nine other people there. And the terrorists' influence was felt as far 
away as the United States, where 55-year-old expatriate cleric Sheik Omar Abdul 
Rahman was arrested and went on trial for alleged complicity in the February 
bombing of Manhattan's World Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Intransigence in Iraq: Nearly two years after the end of the Persian Gulf War, 
Saddam Hussein's government was still tempting fate last January. It launched a 
series of forays into the U.N.-patrolled demilitarized zone at the Kuwaiti 
border to retrieve materiel -- including Chinese Silkworm missiles -- that it 
claimed as its own. Plus, it refused to let aircraft carrying U.N. weapons 
inspection teams land in Baghdad. And so, at mid-month, the United States, 
Britain and France launched air strikes on Iraqi missile sites in the southern 
"no-fly" zone to force compliance with U.N. resolutions that ended the war. 
Then, in April, after a visit to Kuwait by former President George Bush, 
Kuwaiti authorities announced that he had been the target of an 
Iraqi-dispatched assassination team they had intercepted. The Clinton 
Administration was slow to take the accusation seriously, but in June the 
United States launched a cruise missile attack on Baghdad that hit and heavily 
damaged Iraq's intelligence complex in the capital. Clinton said he ordered the 
attack based on "compelling evidence" that Hussein was behind the plot against 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Discontent in Libya: Despite more than a year and a half of a U.N.-imposed 
arms embargo and other sanctions, Moammar Kadafi's government continued to 
refuse to surrender two Libyan intelligence operatives suspected of 
responsibility for the 1988 downing of Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, 
Scotland. But in late October, sources opposed to Kadafi said that discontent 
with the deteriorating quality of life in Libya had resulted in a series of 
uprisings within both the army and the nation's security forces. Diplomatic 
sources agreed that earlier in the month, Kadafi had been forced to violently 
quell rebellions in three areas of central Libya. SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA

 Negotiated Revolution: Three days before Christmas, what once would have been 
unthinkable happened. South Africa's last white-controlled Parliament adopted a 
sweeping new constitution that guarantees equal rights to blacks for the first 
time and officially ends the pernicious policies of apartheid. It was the 
penultimate step in a difficult march to democracy that will culminate in 
one-person, one-vote elections next April 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parliament vote capped a year that had a full measure of triumphs and 
tragedies for South Africa. Among the triumphs was the ratification in July of 
next year's election date by black and white representatives who had engaged in 
two years of stormy negotiations. There was also those negotiators' approval of 
the new constitution in November and the speech that African National Congress 
leader Nelson Mandela gave to the U.N. General Assembly in September, when he 
called on foes of apartheid around the world to lift almost all sanctions 
against Pretoria before economic disaster blocked progress toward democracy. 
President Clinton, for one, lifted most of the U.S. government's remaining 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedies included the assassination in April of the ANC's Chris Hani, one 
of the nation's most charismatic black leaders. Millions of South Africans 
protested Hani's death with one of the largest general strikes in their 
country's history. Then there was the continuing violence by rival factions in 
the black townships and, in July, the massacre by black gunmen of 10 white 
worshipers at a church in a middle-class suburb of Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
 All the same, the year was best symbolized in mid-December when Mandela and 
President Frederik W. de Klerk stood side by side in Oslo to accept the Nobel 
Peace Prize for their joint efforts to forever change their country.  
</P>
<P>
 Difficulties in Somalia: In March, U.S. special envoy Robert B. Oakley 
pronounced the international effort to aid Somalia, launched the previous 
December, a success. Operation Restore Hope, as the U.S.-led mission was 
dubbed, had, said Oakley, achieved its primary mission: to help feed millions 
of Somalis stricken by drought, famine and the tyranny of rival warlords. 
Within weeks, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to set up the largest 
U.N. peacekeeping force in history in the East African nation -- 28,000 troops 
authorized to do whatever was necessary to maintain peace, disarm the warring 
factions and protect relief workers. 
</P>
<P>
 It all seemed too good to be true. And it was. On June 5, 24 Pakistani 
peacekeepers were killed in an ambush widely believed to have been masterminded 
by warlord -- or clan leader -- Mohammed Farah Aidid. U.N. forces then launched 
a series of ground and air assaults raids on Aidid's compound, radio station 
and arms caches, but they failed to flush him out, and in August, President 
Clinton dispatched 400 U.S. Army Rangers to join the hunt. Instead of finding 
Aidid, however, the Rangers lost 16 of their number in an Oct. 3 ambush that 
killed 18 American soldiers in all -- prompting the President to change course 
and pledge to bring all U.S. combat forces home by March 31. In response, Aidid 
announced a unilateral cease-fire and released an Army pilot who had spent 11 
days in captivity after the Oct. 3 firefight. But in mid-December, five days of 
peace talks among the warring factions collapsed, and there were strong 
indications that the United Nations may have to transform its mission into a 
minuscule, almost token operation after the United States withdraws.  
</P>
<P>
 Coup in Burundi: Fires. Scattered bodies. Rival tribesmen battling with 
machetes. Such were the images coming out of the mountainous Central African 
nation of Burundi after a military coup that began in late October when 
soldiers seized President Melchior Ndadaye and drove other government officials 
into hiding. Ndadaye had become the nation's first democratically elected 
president only in June, and army-controlled state radio confirmed three days 
after his disappearance that he was killed during the coup, masterminded by 
former President Jean-Baptiste Bagaza and the army chief of staff. The rebels 
were ultimately unsuccessful, and former Foreign Minister Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya was elected Speaker of Parliament on Dec. 22, thus becoming the 
country's interim president. But Burundi remained tense as the year ended, and 
it was estimated that 100,000 people had died in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Horror in Angola: In September, 1992, the formerly Marxist government of Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos handily won an election in Angola that the United Nations 
judged free and fair. Defeated was rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, whose forces had 
been backed by the United States since the mid-1970s. But Savimbi charged fraud 
and resumed his battle against the government with a vengeance. The result: 
More than a year after peace was supposed to be restored, Angola is racked by 
the deadliest, most destructive conflict in its history. U.N. Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali declared in September that 1,000 people were dying every 
day from battle wounds, famine and disease from the civil war. And while aid 
officials say that figure was probably too high, they agree that 50,000 to 
100,000 people have perished in the past year and that one-third of Angola's 11 
million people are at risk. However, another round of peace talks is scheduled 
to begin tomorrow in Zambia. EUROPE 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodshed in Bosnia: In April, 1992, Bosnian Serbs and mercenaries from Serbia 
itself -- bent on annexing land for a "Greater Serbia" -- lay siege to 
Sarajevo, the multiethnic capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Twenty-one months 
later, as 1993 drew to a close, the conflict they engendered had deteriorated 
into a savage, three-way civil war involving the Muslim-led Bosnian government, 
Serbs and Croats -- and there was no end in sight. At the beginning of the 
year, Western mediators Lord Owen and Cyrus R. Vance crafted a plan for 
splitting Bosnia into 10 ethnic provinces. The constitutional principles of 
such a confederation were accepted by all three factions, but the proposal went 
down to defeat when the Serbs balked at withdrawing from much of the territory 
they had seized in eastern Bosnia. In September, a new partition agreement 
proposed by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Bosnian Croat chieftain 
Mate Boban gained favor with Owen and his new mediation partner, U.N. envoy 
Thorvald Stoltenberg, as a last-ditch measure for averting a humanitarian 
catastrophe in the coming winter. But the Bosnian government rejected that 
plan, which would have left the republic a landlocked rump comprising less than 
30% of the original state, with the status of the besieged capital still in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 In another effort to alleviate the misery, the United States flew its first 
airdrop mission over Bosnia in late February, parachuting relief supplies to 
besieged Muslim communities in the Serb-occupied east of the republic. And in 
April, U.S. and other Western fighter planes began patrolling a "no-fly" zone 
over Bosnia -- but U.N. opposition to military strikes against the combatants 
prevented any action from being taken to thwart the 1,000-plus recorded 
violations over the rest of the year. Then, in late December, Britain and 
France threatened to pull out their considerable contingents from U.N. forces 
escorting aid -- a move that would undermine already frustrated deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects for a breakthrough appeared far gloomier with the start of 1994, 
with Greece taking its turn in the rotating European Community presidency. 
Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias has promised Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic that Athens will work to get U.N. sanctions lifted from its 
Serbian allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Extremism in Germany: In March, the extreme right-wing Republikaner party 
scored big gains in a bellwether local election -- confirming that racial and 
religious understanding was under fire in Germany. Less than two months later, 
legislators passed a new asylum law to halt the costly influx of nearly half a 
million foreigners annually -- barring asylum seekers who are not fleeing 
political persecution or war and effectively slamming shut the industrialized 
world's last open door for economic refugees. Then, in the worst atrocity to 
befall foreign residents since World War II, five Turkish nationals were killed 
and three others were critically injured in an arson attack on their home in 
the western city of Solingen. The attack was a virtual copy of an incident the 
previous year in the northern city of Moelln, where a Turkish grandmother and 
two girls died when their home was set ablaze. However, two young neo-Nazis 
were convicted of the latter crime in December and given maximum sentences.  
</P>
<P>
 Agreement in the EC: In December, 1991, European Community leaders meeting in 
the Dutch city of Maastricht approved an agreement on West European economic 
and political union. And on Nov. 1 last year, exactly 11 months later than 
planned, the so-called Maastricht Treaty finally went into effect; obtaining 
the consent of all 12 member nations took that long. The pact cleared one 
hurdle in May, when Danish voters endorsed it in a second referendum vote. They 
had rejected it a year earlier, but EC leaders paved the way for the change of 
heart by promising Denmark the right to stay out of many of the treaty's main 
provisions, including the single EC currency and common defense policies. 
Britain's House of Commons gave its approval in July. And Germany's highest 
court removed the final barrier in October, when it rejected a claim that 
Parliament's ratification of the accord violated German law. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope in Northern Ireland: Britons were startled in November when a London 
newspaper revealed that representatives of Her Majesty's government had begun 
meeting in February with members of the Irish Republican Army in an attempt to 
finally end decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. More than 3,100 
people have been killed in the province, also known as Ulster -- and another 
200-plus have died in Britain -- since "the troubles" began in 1968, mainly 
between Irish-nationalist Roman Catholics and pro-British Protestants, with the 
British army vainly trying to keep order. Then, in December, a potential 
breakthrough occurred: British Minister John Major and Irish Prime Minister 
Albert Reynolds jointly announced that they are prepared to bring the IRA to 
the peace table if the group ends its violence. In a seven-page declaration, 
the two countries said that Northern Ireland's Protestant majority may stay in 
the United Kingdom as long as it wants but that Britain has no long-term 
strategic interest in the province and will not oppose union with Ireland if 
the majority wants that. Still, diplomats in London characterized the document 
as the "easy bit" and said that a long, grueling effort lies ahead to persuade 
extremists on both sides to abandon violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy: A continuing crackdown on organized crime was the good news in Italy. 
It led, among other places, to the arrest in January of Salvatore (Toto) Riina, 
the Mafia's 62-year-old boss of bosses, on the lam since 1969 and held 
responsible for more than 50 slayings, including spectuacular assassinations of 
key anti-Mafia figures. But the other side of the coin was a mushrooming 
kickback scandal that implicated about 2,600 business leaders and politicians 
-- or much of the nation's postwar Establishment. Indeed, by April, voters were 
in such a throw-the-bums-out mood that they passed all eight items in a pivotal 
referendum. That included a change in the way three-quarters of the Italian 
Senate is elected, an end to public financing of political parties and the 
abolition of three ministries. Within three days, Prime Minister Giuliano Amato 
had tendered his government's resignation, and, four days later, Preident Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro asked the head of the Bank of Italy, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, to 
form the country's 52nd postwar government. 
</P>
<P>
 Precedent in Turkey: Surprising even themselves, members of Turkey's ruling 
party elected Tansu Ciller as their leader in June, and predictably, the 
following day, she became the nation's first female prime minister. A rich, 
U.S.-educated professor of economics, the 47-year-old Ciller is viewed as one 
of a new generation of politicians who party stalwarts hope will be better able 
than their predecessors to harness the potential of their dynamic Muslim 
nation. She quickly confronted familiar problems: a gaping budget deficit, high 
inflation and a coalition government shy of unpopular decisions. ASIA 
</P>
<P>
 Peace in Cambodia: Altogether, the United Nations spent $2.6 billion on its 
largest-ever peacekeeping mission, aimed at restoring democracy to Cambodia. 
And to worldwide sighs of relief, the effort succeeded. During six days in May, 
about 90% of registered voters turned out to select a new Constituent Assembly 
-- in the first free, multi-party elections in more than 40 years. Except for 
minor incidents, the notorious Khmer Rouge failed to follow through on a 
promise to disrupt the vote, for which it refused to field candidates. Some of 
the Maoist rebels were even observed ferrying rural voters to polls and 
presenting valid registration cards and voting themselves. The most seats were 
won by the opposition royalist party loyal to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and in 
September, Sihanouk signed into law a democratic constitution, took his place 
as king and appointed a government to lead the country to peace and 
reconciliation after more than two decades of civil war. That ended the formal 
U.N. mandate and also marked one of the great political comebacks of the 20th 
Century. Sihanouk, now 71, was first crowned king by French colonialists in 
1941.

 Second Chance in Pakistan: Benazir Bhutto, the first woman to lead a modern 
Muslim state, lost her job as prime minister of Pakistan in 1990 when her 
government was dismissed on charges of corruption and misrule. She was replaced 
by Nawaz Sharif. But last April, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dissolved 
Parliament and fired Sharif, who had been trying for months to weaken the 
presidency. In July, Ishaq Khan resigned (as did Sharif, who had survived his 
sacking). And in October, Bhutto regained the premiership after her liberal 
Pakistan People's Party won the most seats in nationwide elections. She still 
faces considerable opposition from Sharif's conservative Pakistan Muslim League 
-- although Sharif said he had no intention of trying to undermine her 
government.

 Civilian Leader in South Korea: Kim Young Sam's name and image were banned in 
South Korea's mass media when he was a leader of the opposition. But in 
February, Kim became the nation's first civilian president in 32 years. He 
pledged to root out corruption, revitalize the sagging economy and enhance 
"national discipline." And he promptly launched a sweeping series of reforms 
that purged politicians, police, prosecutors, judges, military leaders and 
other bureaucrats suspected of amassing illicit fortunes under the military-led 
governments that ruled the country from 1961 to 1993.

 New Era in Japan: Japan witnessed its biggest political upheaval in nearly 
four decades as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party -- increasingly hemmed in 
by corruption scandals and seemingly incapable of reform -- lost control of the 
government for the first time since 1955. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's 
administration began to unravel in June, only weeks after Crown Prince 
Naruhito's marriage to former diplomat Masako Owada had delighted the nation. 
The prime minister's troubles began when he caved in to LDP bigwigs and agreed 
to drop efforts to negotiate political reforms with opposition parties. That 
led 44 lawmakers to defect from his party and, in elections in July, it lost 
its longtime majority in the lower house of Parliament. The result: Japan got 
its first coalition government since 1948, headed by 55-year-old Morihiro 
Hosokawa, the nation's youngest prime minister since 1972. Hosokawa's accession 
clouded Japan's political outlook but also offered a stronger promise of 
political and electoral reform than at any time during the LDP's reign. But as 
the year ended without any significant changes, that promise remained just a 
promise.

 Disappointment in China: "A More Open China Awaits 2000 Olympics" -- or so 
said countless billboards and banners in Beijing. They were all part of the 
nation's campaign promoting its capital as the best site for the year 2000 
Olympic Games. But they were all for naught. Meeting in Monte Carlo, the 
International Olympic Committee chose Sydney, Australia -- which got 45 votes 
to Beijing's 43. Human rights activists interpreted the vote as an endorsement 
of their campaign to dissuade the IOC from selecting Beijing only four years 
after the crackdown on demonstrators in Tian An Men Square. A month after the 
IOC vote, China incurred international displeasure with an underground nuclear 
test that President Clinton, for one, had specifically requested it to cancel 
-- the explosion broke a yearlong global moratorium on nuclear testing. Thus 
China ended the year looking more fearsome than it had in the spring, when its 
representatives met in Singapore for two days of historic, though only 
semiofficial, talks with negotiators from its bitter rival, Taiwan. That had 
represented the highest-level contact between Beijing and Taipei since the 
Communist victory over the Nationalists in 1949.

 Disaster in India: It was the subcontinent's deadliest earthquake in many 
decades -- perhaps in history. Before dawn on Sept. 30, a magnitude 6.4 temblor 
rocked south-central India, devastating more than two dozen villages. That 
necessitated the Indian army's biggest-ever rescue effort, made more difficult 
not only by occasional monsoon rains but also by tens of thousands of onlookers 
who converged on the scenes of destruction. Reports of the dead ranged as high 
as 30,000, although the government said the confirmed toll was fewer than 
10,000.

<P>
 Mystery in North Korea: Pyongyang stunned both its edgy neighbors and Western 
powers in March when it abruptly declared that it was withdrawing from the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty it joined in 1985. The surprise announcement 
seemed aimed at forestalling international inspection of facilites suspected -- 
despite North Korean denials -- of being used to develop a nuclear-weapons 
capability. Although the secretive Communist regime later "suspended" its 
withdrawal, it attracted even more global attention in November when the 
director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. body, officially 
informed the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea had consistently refused to 
allow his inspectors to visit its nuclear sites. And there the situation stood 
as the year ended, with the Clinton Administration indicating that it will 
press for a U.N. oil embargo on North Korea if the dispute reaches an impasse. 
LATIN AMERICA

 Deepening Woe in Haiti: The Haitian people's struggle with destitution and 
despair looked fierce last January, as the new Clinton Administration had the 
Coast Guard and Navy continue enforcing a blockade aimed at preventing 
boatloads of refugees from fleeing to the United States. And their lot looked 
equally hopeless in December, after a year of international pressure had failed 
to restore ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. Aristide -- the 
country's first-ever democratically elected leader -- was forced to flee by a 
September, 1991, military coup, and despite his apparent willingness in the 
spring to grant an amnesty to the coup leaders, they balked at allowing him to 
return. In June, an exasperated U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to 
impose tough sanctions on oil and arms deliveries to the nation and to impose a 
financial embargo intended to hit not only the military regime but also its 
backers among the Haitian elite. Within a month that tactic seemed to have been 
effective: A week of negotiating on Governors Island in New York Harbor 
produced an agreement between Aristide and military ruler Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras 
specifying that Aristide could resume office by Oct. 30. But that promise 
proved illusory. Indeed, when a shipload of U.S. and Canadian advisers arrived 
in the capital in mid-October, port officials refused to allow it to dock. As 
the year ended, the United States and the United Nations continued the blockade 
of nearly all oil products and other strategic goods but had withdrawn active 
diplomatic involvement in settlement efforts.

 Big Chill in El Salvador: Although officially over, the 12-year civil war in 
El Salvador continued to cast a chill over events there. In March, a 
U.N.-appointed Commission on Truth issued a scathing report identifying 
prominent military and Establishment figures as perpetrators of assassinations, 
massacres and other atrocities during the war. To take one example: The report 
singled out Gen. Rene Emilio Ponce, who had just resigned as minister of 
defense, as the officer who ordered the murders of six Jesuit priests in 1989. 
But at the urging of President Alfredo Cristiani, the National Assembly, 
dominated by Cristiani's right-wing party, passed a sweeping amnesty law that 
pardoned all such crimes, and the first men to be freed under the law were two 
army officers convicted in those murders. In July, Cristiani did complete a 
purge of the army, as required under the terms of the peace accords ending the 
war. But in late October, former rebel commander Francisco Velis was 
assassinated, and his murder raised fears among the left and among U.N. 
peacekeepers that death squads similar to those that terrorized El Salvador 
during the 1980s are once again operating -- bent on eliminating opposition in 
advance of nationwide elections scheduled for March. 
</P>
<P>
 Closure in Colombia: After escaping from a luxury prison in July, 1992, 
Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar had been on the run for 16 months. But 
security forces finally caught up with him in December in his hometown of 
Medellin, and he died in the resulting shootout. During the previous decade, 
Escobar had waged a ferocious war with the government in the course of building 
a cocaine empire that funneled billions of dollars' worth of drugs into the 
United States and Europe. Tens of thousands of Colombians were killed in that 
conflict, including judges, journalists, leftist leaders and four presidential 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Crisis Mode in Nicaragua: For nearly a week in August, a double-barreled 
hostage drama gripped Nicaragua -- but it ended without bloodshed. At one 
point, two sets of kidnapers -- rearmed Contra rebels in the north and retired 
Sandinista soldiers in the capital, Managua -- held nearly 80 people captive, 
including several lawmakers and the vice president. But the two bands of gunmen 
released their hostages gradually until all were freed. Still, President 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro emerged from the episode weaker than ever. She had 
to turn to former President Daniel Ortega and Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel 
Obando y Bravo to negotiate with the hostage-takers, and both groups were 
allowed to escape unpunished. Also, she remained unable to count on aid from 
the United States. That was suspended earlier in the summer, after an explosion 
underneath an auto body shop on the outskirts of Managua revealed a huge cache 
of weapons, including antiaircraft missiles, stockpiled by Salvadoran 
guerrillas in violation of the peace accords that ended El Salvador's civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Power Grab in Guatemala: Two weeks of political chaos ensued after Guatemalan 
President Jorge Serrano suspended the restive Central American nation's 
constitution in May and dissolved its Congress and Supreme Court. He declared 
that he was forced to seized absolute power because corrupt lawmakers and 
judges -- some, he claimed, bought by drug money -- were blackmailing him, 
demanding bribes to go along with his policies. But Serrano's "self-coup" 
triggered economic sanctions from the United States and Europe along with 
widespread domestic opposition. A week later, he was ousted by the army and 
forced to flee the country. Next, his vice president, Gustavo Espino Salguero, 
tried to take over, but Congress refused to swear him in. Instead, a coalition 
of business, labor and political groups, with army support, united to steer 
Guatemala back to constitutional rule. To the surprise of many, human rights 
ombudsman Ramiro de Leon Carpio was selected president by Congress and 
installed June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico: Every six years, the political party that has ruled Mexico for more 
than six decades engages in a mysterious ritual to select its next presidential 
candidate. This time the Institutional Revolutionary Party named Luis Donaldo 
Colosio to be its new standard-bearer. Colosio, 43, is among the best-known 
politicians in Mexico because, as social development secretary under current 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, he oversees a popular anti-poverty 
program. His nomination virtually assures that he will be president after 
elections next Aug. 24. NORTH AMERICA

 Defeat in Canada: The Progressive Conservative Party governed Canada for nine 
years. It stood for hard-right economic conservatism, cuts in social spending, 
a new value-added tax and the North American Free Trade Agreement. When Prime 
Minister Brian Mulroney stepped down in June, it even gave the nation its first 
female prime minister -- Kim Campbell, a sharp-tongued 46-year-old lawyer who 
had been defense minister under Mulroney. But the Tories' austerity program 
also brought about a lingering recession, 11% unemployment and widespread 
public disillusionment about the future. And in October, voters delivered an 
astonishing rebuke to the party, which finished a humiliating fifth in national 
elections -- the biggest single loss of seats in Canadian history. Replacing it 
was a majority Liberal Party government led by Jean Chretien, a 59-year-old 
French-speaking lawyer from Quebec. The vote also thrust into prominence the 
separatist Bloc Quebecois, giving Quebec nationalists more power at the federal 
level than ever. INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
</P>
<P>
 Deal in Geneva: Seven years and three months of frequently acrimonious 
bargaining finally came to an end on Dec. 15 in Switzerland as 117 nations 
approved a monumental world trade agreement that will slash import taxes, or 
tariffs, around the globe by an average of 40%, open markets for food and 
consumer goods and extend protections to the growing business of international 
financial services. The accord -- negotiated under the auspices of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- is one of the most far-reaching economic 
pacts ever and is scheduled to take effect at the beginning of next year. It 
will bring down the price of a wide range of products, from aircraft to yarn. 
For the Clinton Administration, the major disappointment of the talks was the 
failure to reach an agreement with the European Community to bring satellite 
television, movies and other elements of the audiovisual business into the 
pact; that shortcoming was viewed as a major failure by Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Pact in North America: The proposed North American Free Trade Agreement would 
eliminate most tariffs, quotas and other barriers to unrestrained commerce 
among the United States, Mexico and Canada over a 15-year period beginning Jan. 
1, and it moved several steps closer to reality last year. In August, 
simultaneous announcements in Washington, Mexico City and Ottawa confirmed that 
negotiators had completed important supplementary agreements to the accord. 
These side deals would establish fact-finding missions and provide for trade 
sanctions or fines if any of the three partners failed to enforce its labor or 
environmental laws. Then, in November, the U.S. Congress gave its approval to 
NAFTA after a rancorous national debate that widened into a consideration of 
the fundamental changes sweeping the U.S. economy. At year's end, though, 
neither Canada nor Mexico had yet given a formal OK to the agreement.

SPEAKING OF: FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Times researcher ANN GRIFFITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Extended families become nuclear families; nuclear families become 
single-parent families; divorce is on the increase; cohabitation without 
marriage gains popularity; same-sex families organize; birthrates decline.  
</P>
<P>
 The very concept of the family is undergoing rapid and profound change nearly 
everywhere, which is one reason the U.N. General Assembly has proclaimed 1994 
the International Year of the Family. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakdown of the extended family forces more aging parents to turn to 
government and private organizations for survival. Single-parent families are 
mostly headed by women, and many exist at or below the poverty level. Homes in 
which both parents work yield a generation of latchkey children. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. proclamation reflects increasing global concern over the situation of 
the family. Its objective: to foster among policy-makers a greater appreciation 
of this fundamental building block of society and to inspire increased action 
on its behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the key measures affecting the quality of family life in selected 
nations: Highlights 
</P>
<P>
 * Largest Families: Iraq and the Maldives, with an average of 7.1 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Smallest: Denmark, Monaco and Sweden, with 2.2 members. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fewest families headed by women: Pakistan, only 4.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Most: 45% in Botswana, Grenada and the islands of St. Kitts and Nevis in the 
West Indies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marriage: Men and women both tend to get married well into their 30s in St. 
Lucia and Jamaica, while in Sao Tome and Principe, tiny volcanic islands off 
West Africa, the mean age for men at marriage is 21.6, and for women, 15.6. 
</P>
<P>
 * Youngest population: Malawi, with nearly 21% under age 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Oldest: Monaco, with more than 29% over age 60. 
</P>
<P>
 * Home ownership: Singapore takes the crown with 90%. In Qatar, the figure is 
less than 22%. Declining Fertility Rates 
</P>
<P>
 Spacing pregnancies and decreasing improve the health of mothers and their 
babies and will eventually help to stabilize population growth and preserve 
nations' natural and economic resources. Fewer children also allows parents 
more time and money to care for their children, to say nothing of themselves.

VALLEY INTERVIEW: BURBANK SCHOOLS LEADER SEES DRESS CODE AS GANG PREVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Abigail Goldman, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In September, Gov. Pete Wilson signed a bill that allows school districts to 
ban students from wearing clothing deemed to be associated with gangs. The 
Burbank Unified School District adopted an anti-gang dress code that took 
effect this week. Arthur N. Pierce, superintendent of Burbank schools, 
discussed the policy with Times staff writer Abigail Goldman. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: What is gang-related apparel?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Elementary school examples include bandannas worn around the forehead, 
worn around the legs folded in certain ways or hanging from the back pocket, 
because those are gang-membership signals; hair nets not worn for health 
reasons but worn as a mode of dress; excessively baggy pants worn well below 
the waist; wool shirts with only the top button buttoned, worn over a white 
T-shirt over baggy pants -- the total gang look; certain sports team jackets 
and caps, generally ones that have black and white as their theme colors; 
overalls of the farmer type with one strap worn unfastened -- in that case the 
actual outfit is not a problem, but when worn in a certain manner, it becomes a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondary-school apparel includes most of the above and, in addition, belt 
buckles with initials which are not the initials of the person wearing the 
belt, baseball-type hats, extra-long belts with excess strap hanging down or 
webbing-type belts, work-type pants that are cut off below the knees but worn 
with high knee socks or various combinations of those which are considered to 
be gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you decide which types of clothing might pertain to gangs?  
</P>
<P>
 A: This is a matter of observation and experience by the sight administrators 
and teachers and as validated by the Burbank Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has there been gang activity in Burbank schools?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There has been gang activity in the community of Burbank and the 
surrounding communities. Fortunately, we've had almost no gang activity within 
the schools themselves. But the concern is that if a child comes to school in 
gang attire, then that student, whether or not a gang member, may be taken as a 
gang member. We want to avoid in Burbank the things which we hear about in 
surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can you decide the difference between baggy and overly baggy or fashion 
and gang attire?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There's no perfect answer to that. I believe that our administrators have 
enough experience in working directly with the students at their campuses. Each 
of our secondary campuses is assigned a police officer, known as a school 
resource officer, and the interchange between the (officer) and the campus 
administrator helps them make judgments about (whether it is) simply fashion? 
Or even if it is fashion, is it fashion which puts that student and anyone 
standing near the student at risk? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Isn't there also room for selective enforcement? If it's left to an 
administrator or a teacher, isn't there a chance that good students can get 
away with dressing in a fashion that a poorer student might not?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There certainly is that chance. Again, by working closely with the 
administrators, who are the ultimate arbiters of this, we would hope to 
mitigate against that occurring in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the consequences of breaking the code?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Clothing is easily correctable. If a student were to refuse to change when 
an adult asked them to, then the parent and the student and the school would 
have to work out an appropriate discipline. Ultimately, violation of school 
rules, i.e., defiance, could mean expulsion, but it is highly unlikely that one 
would get to that point on an issue of this nature. The next level less than 
that is suspension and, again, it is unlikely suspension would be used. But 
under the law, we believe it could be used. 
</P>
<P>
 The much more likely consequence is the one we have been using even without 
the new state law. If a student comes dressed inappropriately, if it's 
something to be turned inside out or taken off, such as a belt, then the 
student turns the item inside out or takes the belt off and leaves it in the 
principal's office, and it can be retrieved after school. Another alternative 
is that some schools have a supply of sweat shirts and sweat pants and, if a 
student is wearing something inappropriate, then they're asked to exchange that 
item or cover it with a sweat shirt or sweat pants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Gang clothing can change as quickly as you can codify it. How are you going 
to keep up?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We're never going to keep 100% up. There will be things on the list which 
are outdated and no longer need to be on there. There will be some things that 
aren't on the list that should be. One of the beauties of this policy is it 
leaves it to the administrator to actually develop the list, so we can change 
that as frequently as we need. The exact wording, for example, on athletic 
attire will be generic enough so that if Raiders jackets are no longer the 
issue, but Kings jackets are, that decision can be made and enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can't the way students dress be seen as just an attempt to express 
themselves, or to buck authority in a non-confrontational way?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I've been a superintendent of schools since the 1960s and therefore I can 
relate, from an administrative viewpoint, to the definite testings of authority 
that took place then. The difference between the dress of the '60s and 1990 is 
the safety of the person who is wearing that clothing. We're talking about, 
literally, life and death. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can a code like this really stem violence?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We believe that it can reduce the likelihood that someone would become a 
target, and that is very important. Our schools in Burbank have been 
gang-neutral. We don't have gang-related incidents on our campuses. And we 
intend to keep it that way. We certainly see in other communities and other 
states that have had voluntary uniforms that, in fact, the whole tenor of that 
school seems to be more positive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there any proof that asking students to dress or not to dress a certain 
way actually reduces the number of violent incidents?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The Burbank Police Department has informed us that the manner in which one 
dresses is directly related to the likelihood of that person's being targeted 
in a potential attack situation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But have any schools actually reported a reduction in violent incidents 
after imposing these rules?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I can't give you statistics because I, frankly, don't have any. But what we 
hear from other administrators and teachers are those kinds of comments that, 
yes, when we enforce a dress code, the number of incidents either decreases or 
does not increase as rapidly as it does in schools that do not have a code. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There are some critics who would charge that you're treating a symptom of a 
symptom of a problem -- that gang attire is a symptom of gang activity which is 
a symptom of much larger social problems. Are you treating the wrong thing?  
</P>
<P>
 A: As with any illness, you treat the symptoms, but you also deal with the 
illness, and the illness is what you really need to be addressing. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Burbank and the Burbank Unified School District jointly, I 
believe, are doing all that we currently believe is possible to address the 
root problem, which is the formation of gangs, the membership in gangs, 
"tagging" and the antisocial behavior that are associated with those 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Where we find someone who is "infected," or is about to be infected, we try to 
divert them. We're not leaving it just at dress. We're addressing alternative 
activities through recreation, alternative activities through the schools and 
enforcement of behavior.
