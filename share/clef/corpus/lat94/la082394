 Talking out of school: Those "My Kid Is On the Honor Roll of. . . ." bumper 
stickers, which some drivers view as one more annoyance on the freeway, have 
inspired some not-so-kind parodies. One takeoff brags about the driver's dog. 
Another, spotted by J.R. Cline of L.A., proclaims: "My Kid Beat Up Your Honor 
Roll Kid." 
</P>
<P>
 We can't blame parents for exhibiting the serious ones. What are they supposed 
to do when the schools give the bumper stickers to the kids? On the other hand, 
maybe Dad or Mom could try this ploy on the kid: "I'm so proud of you I'm going 
to mount this on a wall in my study!" 
</P>
<P>
 We suspect, though, that the abbreviated report cards will continue to crop up 
on bumpers. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent takeoff we saw was on a woman's car on the 605 Freeway. It 
said: "My Husband Is on the Honor Roll at the Institute for the Sexually 
Gifted." She was driving alone, which made us wonder. We know she doesn't have 
to worry about her husband's grades at the school. But what about his 
extracurricular activities?

 High school confidential: Speaking of students, one common denominator in 
several high-visibility court cases has been the presence of an alumnus of West 
L.A.'s Hamilton High.

 Robert L. Shapiro, one of O.J. Simpson's attorneys, is a Hami grad, as is 
Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg, the presiding judge in both the 
Menendez brothers trial and the first Rodney G. King trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Another ex-Hamiltonian is Gerald L. Chaleff, the attorney for defendant Neil 
Woodman in the so-called "Ninja Killer" case. Woodman's brother, Stewart, has 
been convicted of first-degree murder in connection with the shooting death of 
the brothers' parents. The Woodmans also attended Hamilton, by the way. 
</P>
<P>
 We shouldn't forget that Alexander Hamilton died in a high-visibility shooting 
himself at the hands of Aaron Burr in a duel in 1804. The shooting resulted in 
no court action.

AL MARTINEZ: AND THE WINNER IS BOTH

<TEXT>
<P>
 The scheduling of the trials of Heidi Fleiss and O.J. Simpson to start on the 
same day, Sept. 19, has thrown the news media into a quandary. 
</P>
<P>
 Both trials, appealing as they do to our basest human instincts, are going to 
require full coverage in order to relate every bloody and/or erotic detail to 
an anxiously awaiting public. 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, will stretch resources to the maximum, and raises the 
inevitable question: Does everyone have sufficient personnel to mount two 
complete, all-inclusive, three-ring media circuses? 
</P>
<P>
 As you know from past experiences, a media circus is composed of elephants 
with cameras that stand on their haunches, bellow and smash their way through 
crowds, and of clowns with pencils, pads and tape recorders who flip, tumble 
and knock each other down in order to entertain the bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy mounting a media circus. Television is especially troubled. Both 
cases have terrific audience appeal and both cry out for live coverage. But how 
does one station cover both trials live at the same time? 
</P>
<P>
 Split-screen coverage would drive everyone crazy, and switching back and forth 
creates a condition known as the Blurred Screen Syndrome, which can lead to 
blindness, lunacy and a tendency to vote Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 What we've got to do is decide which is more important to the American public, 
sex or violence, and concentrate on one or the other. How do we determine that? 
I've been working on it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It just so happens we held a reunion of my extended family over the weekend, 
composed of everyone from great-aunts to grandchildren. Seventy of them came 
from as far away as New York, where they live incognito among Puerto Ricans, 
and from as close as Oakland, which is my native land. 
</P>
<P>
 They are from all walks of life. I have relatives with Ph.D.s in ancient 
languages who can balance six-syllable words on their noses, and relatives who 
can field-strip and reassemble an AK-47 before you can say N.R.A.  
</P>
<P>
 They are a fairly good sample of Americana in that they represent a 
cross-section of people in different educational, financial and criminal 
brackets, except for Aunt Zulema whose conditions of parole will not allow her 
to leave Arizona. She asked me to say, however, she is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 I mention all this because I polled them during the reunion as to what they 
would prefer seeing as part of a media circus: sex, as it is represented in the 
Heidi Fleiss case, or violence, as represented in the O.J. Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more interesting responses came from my Uncle Claude from Portland. 
Claude, who like Forrest Gump is not a very smart man, said simply, "Why can't 
they combine them?" 
</P>
<P>
 He was thinking of the kinds of television shows that feature both sex and 
violence. I explained that was fiction and this was real life. When that eluded 
him, I said it would be like combining "Models Inc." and "Real Stories of the 
Highway Patrol" and he understood. 
</P>
<P>
 A cousin with degrees from both the University of Chicago and Columbia 
launched into an oral dissertation on sex as violence and violence as sex, and 
became so boring that everyone walked away. She just kept on hypothesizing 
anyway until her husband finally carried her to the car, the poor thing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I thought my niece Maria-14 came up with a good answer. We call her 14 because 
so many of the female members of my family are named Maria that we had to 
resort to numerical designations in order to tell them apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria-14 said that since lawyers are the real stars of the shows, I mean 
trials, they ought to do what actors do and hold out for more money unless the 
trials are held on alternate days in order to give them maximum exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncle Leo from Baltimore, whom everyone suspects of being a bookie, added to 
that by suggesting that the trial coverage, like major sporting events, be sold 
to the network that comes up with the most money. He offered 2-to-1 odds that 
Fox would get the Simpson trial and ABC would get Heidi. 
</P>
<P>
 I polled as many relatives as I could during the time I had. It was essential 
that the work be done within the first hour or so of the reunion due to a 
tendency in my family to drink a lot of wine and lose the thread of their 
response midway through an answer to my question. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't have exact numbers because I think my Great-Aunt Maria-2 from Santa Fe 
threw my notes away with her paper plate. But as I recall, it was a tossup 
between the sex circus and the violence circus, though my niece Maria-6 from 
Cincinnati was bold enough to shout, "I like sex!" as the evening ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll pray for her," my sister Emily from Oakland said. Somebody better.

THE ASSAULT ON COMMON SENSE; WHY IN THE WORLD DOES EVEN THE NRA NEED TO PROTECT 
THESE WEAPONS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many members of Congress who opposed the Clinton Administration's crime bill 
before it finally passed the House Sunday focused their objections on the cost 
and merit of the big-ticket social programs in the measure. But the furious 
lobbying against the bill over the weekend by the National Rifle Assn. made it 
clear beyond any doubt that the real issue at stake was the federal assault 
weapons ban. That the heavily compromised crime bill survived with this 
important provision intact speaks volumes about a coalescing national demand 
for limits on the now out-of control possession of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 So too does the resignation of Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) Sunday from the 
NRA board. Dingell, an NRA member since 1968, voted for the crime bill even 
though he opposes the assault ban. The modified package, he said, was in "the 
best interests of the country as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 NRA members have an absolute right to the views they hold, of course, and 
their organization still wields fearsome power in Washington and in state 
capitals. Summary defeats of worthy gun control measures this year in 
Sacramento can be laid squarely at the feet of the NRA.  
</P>
<P>
 But if defeats of such legislation demonstrate the group's enduring power, 
then events such as passage of the House crime bill signal growing public 
frustration with its opposition to even modest gun regulations. Passage of the 
Brady bill last year, imposing a waiting period between purchase and possession 
of a handgun so that states can check the background of prospective owners, was 
a six-year odyssey, blocked at virtually every turn by the NRA.  
</P>
<P>
 The assault gun ban prohibits the manufacture and sale of 19 kinds of assault 
weapons. It also outlaws generic features including pistol grips, folding 
stocks and high-volume detachable ammunition magazines. Guns with these 
features are not designed for hunting, although some hunters do descend to use 
them, or for protection, although some law-abiding citizens now own them for 
that reason. They are designed to commit mayhem and that's exactly what they do 
all too often.  
</P>
<P>
 The crime package now returns to the Senate for final action. There the 
assault ban faces yet more withering pressure from the NRA's Senate allies, 
including Sen. Larry E. Craig (R-Ida.), another NRA board member. We only hope 
that Sens. Craig, Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and others 
who say they will try to block the bill, will, like Rep. Dingell, eventually 
distinguish between the best interests of the NRA and those of the nation.

MEXICO AND ZEDILLO PASS A CRUCIAL TEST; SALINAS' CANDIDATE BECOMES HIS 
SUCCESSOR IN MEXICAN NATIONAL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were incidents of fraud and other voting irregularities, to be sure, and 
even angry protests during Mexico's national elections last weekend. But 
overall the voting was peaceful, the ballot counting appeared to be honest and 
the voter turnout was an impressive 70%. All reassuring, given the turmoil -- 
from guerrilla fighting to the murder of the ruling party's presidential 
candidate -- leading up to Sunday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 So Mexico's 1994 elections must be regarded as another historic achievement 
for the government of outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, whose 
efforts at political reform had heretofore lagged behind his remarkable 
achievements in modernizing Mexico's economy. Salinas has set a high standard 
for President-elect Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon to match. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was left happy, of course. Leftist opposition candidate 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas insists he was the real winner of Sunday's presidential 
balloting -- that the 1994 election was stolen from him by fraud as many 
Mexicans believe the 1988 election was. But by virtually every measure -- from 
independent exit polls to early quick counts to the all-important official 
results -- Zedillo won a clear, though certainly not overwhelming victory over 
Cardenas as well as over Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the rightist National 
Action Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo's winning margin of less than 50% is not a particularly impressive 
total, given the fact he was the candidate of the powerful apparatus of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has not lost a presidential 
election in more than 65 years. The PRI's national network of veteran political 
operatives clearly pulled out all the stops for their man, including a few 
instances of the ballot-box stuffing and multiple voting for which the ruling 
party is notorious. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end the more than 35,000 Mexican and foreign election observers who 
fanned out to monitor 96,000 polling places reported that fraud or other 
problems (like mysteriously running out of ballots in certain places) occurred 
at less than 10% of the precincts. So the high-tech voting system Salinas spent 
$2 billion building worked to assure Mexico of an election that, while far from 
perfect, was fairer than any before it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the irregularities on the fringes of his victory cannot discredit 
Zedillo, they won't make his job any easier. They will reinforce the cynicism 
many Mexicans feel about the PRI and the political system it dominates. Zedillo 
will also take office as the first PRI president with less than a majority 
vote. And election results for Mexico's Congress, whose members also were 
elected Sunday, indicate he will face opposition blocs that, if they combine 
against him, can stall his initiatives. All of those facts will serve as 
unprecedented checks on presidential power in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Zedillo Mexican voters appear to have picked a president with the 
intelligence to govern effectively despite all these new problems. A 
Yale-educated economist who had been a member of Salinas' Cabinet, Zedillo was 
hand-picked by the Mexican president to succeed the assassinated Luis Donaldo 
Colosio as the PRI's standard-bearer. Although dismissed by many at the time as 
a cold technocrat, Zedillo seemed to grow a political personality during the 
campaign, articulating progressive new ideas to build on the Salinas legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Intellectual and political progressivism was expected in economic policy, 
given the free-market liberalism and Ivy League training that Zedillo and 
Salinas share. But it could be even more important in politics, where Zedillo 
has promised to open up the Mexican governing process to eliminate official 
corruption and cede more power to Congress as well as to state and municipal 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 If he acts on his campaign promises, Zedillo will ensure that Sunday's 
election is only the beginning of a modern, more mature Mexican democracy.

DID COUNCIL RAKE VALLEY OVER QUAKE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council last Wednesday voted to slice a modest housing 
recovery pie three ways: $14.7 million to replace quake-damaged housing in the 
San Fernando Valley, $14 million for areas damaged by the 1992 riots, $18.3 
million for projects citywide. An earlier proposal would have given a larger 
share of this funding, an additional $8.3 million, to the Valley, but it failed 
on a 6-6 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 This has led to an out-of-proportion dispute, one that feeds into a sense that 
the Valley has been robbed in terms of aid. (Wrong.) Wednesday's vote has also 
led some Valley constituents to argue that their council representatives left 
town knowing a crucial vote was to be held. (Wrong.) And another version has 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas engineering the last-minute scheduling of the 
vote to deliberately exclude Valley members. (Wrong.) 
</P>
<P>
 First, Councilmen Joel Wachs, Zev Yaroslavsky and Hal Bernson each gained 
prior approval to miss the Aug. 17 meeting, well before the vote was scheduled. 
Ridley-Thomas did not sneak this onto the agenda. It was officially posted Aug. 
12, five days before the council meeting. Yes, the council could have set the 
matter aside to allow the three Valley members to vote. (It should have.) But 
it's also true that those Valley members could have done more to seek a 
postponement days before the meeting. (They should have.) 
</P>
<P>
 The issue can be resolved more amiably and fairly today when the council votes 
on whether to reconsider the way in which that pie was cut. (It should vote to 
reconsider.) 
</P>
<P>
 However, the entire matter should be placed in the context of a dispute over 
less than seven-hundredths of 1% of the largest aid package ever assembled for 
a U.S. natural disaster. The lion's share of that $12-billion total is 
rightfully being funneled to the Valley. This is hardly a reason to feel 
slighted. (But emotions aren't always rational.)

PRESIDENT CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a cogent editorial ("You're President . . . and They're Not," Aug. 15), 
The Times has urged President Clinton to press on with his ambitious agenda 
despite a troublesome first two years. Emphasized are the President's enormous 
energy, intelligence and appetite for the big issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the veto presidency of George Bush, here is a leader who has 
dared to engage the time-encrusted monsters of health care, crime, foreign 
trade (NAFTA), budgetary control, the environment and government waste. 
Notwithstanding his Administration's stumbling and Republican obstructionism at 
almost every turn, Clinton has set before the American people uncomfortable and 
unavoidable choices that will have profound impact on their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson has written, "People wish to be settled; only as far as they are 
unsettled is there any hope for them." Viewed from that perspective, the 
battle-scarred Clinton presidency gives us much to hope for in the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 WILLIAM CORZINE 
</P>
<P>
 Hacienda Heights 
</P>
<P>
 * Your editorial is very well stated except that the culprits causing 
President Clinton problems are from both parties, as many Democrats as 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The editorial did, however, hit on the real problem when you stated, "You have 
tremendous energy, an enormous appetite for the big issues . . . and an obvious 
desire to make this country better." The problem is the President's ideology is

WOODSTOCK REVISITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * This is the happiest weekend of my life (Aug. 12-14). Why? I don't have to 
worry about any children of mine being at Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a liberal guy. Why can't Woodstock last for a whole year -- that's a lot 
of morons off the streets. No! Wait! Tell them they can only go home if they 
read one book, "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," so 
they will know how this world is going to end up. For the Romans, it started 
with a radical change in the music. Ah, screw it, maybe it's too late. We are 
all gonna end up in those portable toilets Woodstock rented. Long live Perry 
Como.

 * Thanks to Bob Guccione Jr. (Commentary, Aug. 14) for reminding us of 
progressive radio with no playlists and progressive rock. However, as an 
ex-Jerseyan who listened to the legendary WNEW-FM, I must correct the record 
and offer my two cents: 
</P>
<P>
 Allison Steele started her show at 10 p.m., not at midnight. She did read her 
poetry each night to start her show, but she immediately went into the music. I 
never recall her talking -- let alone for "15 minutes" -- before playing her 
first song! 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Schwartz, whom Guccione rightly calls "FM's preeminent philosopher," 
did indeed play Frank Sinatra and King Crimson (as well as his -- and my -- 
favorite band, Gentle Giant). Jonathan knew the Sinatra music because his dad, 
Arthur, was one of our greatest songwriters of that era. The Southern 
California stations should air Jonathan's New York weekend morning show, which 
plays the best of that era's music. We can finally show Angelenos the wit and 
wisdom of New York, not the bad Lenny Bruce impressions offered by Howard 
Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 One final thought: Guccione is on to something about corporate rock and 
Woodstock. If he goes back to Frank Zappa's album (now CD) "We're Only in It 
for the Money" (1968), he'd hear Zappa say the corporate takeover of rock had 
already begun. Woodstock was, in fact, the birth pangs of "the me decade," not 
the climax of the '60s youth movement.

COMET COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William Pfaff (Commentary, Aug. 8) belittles an effort afoot in Congress to 
initiate a watch for comets with potential for collision with the Earth. After 
trotting out silly arguments about how unlikely this event is -- and Jupiter's 
recent unpleasantness shows it isn't all that unlikely -- he then quotes the 
usual theological cop-out about "God in his inscrutable wisdom" deciding that 
it's time to destroy mankind and so we shouldn't attempt to "thwart" 
him.(Somehow, that argument doesn't ring true for me. If it were valid, why 
would we take antibiotics when we get sick?) 
</P>
<P>
 An encounter with even a relatively small comet or asteroid would probably 
terminate human life -- and quite possibly all life -- on this planet. Somehow, 
I think that it would be sadly ironic if mankind managed to avoid nuclear 
annihilation, only to fall victim to some bad cosmic joke like a cometary 
collision. To me, it makes sense to do whatever we can to save ourselves.

GENDER OF GOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Our Father Figure Who Art in Heaven," Column Right, Aug. 14: 
</P>
<P>
 I disagree with Dennis Prager's arguments for continuing to depict God as a 
solely masculine being. If 4,000 years of Judeo-Christian morality based on 
accountancy to a male God has given a culture in which, as Prager notes, "boys 
take rules" only "from men" and men commit violent acts against women more 
often than women do against them (Prager, again), maybe there's a connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it possible that if we taught children to conceive of God as a creator 
in whom both the divine feminine and the divine masculine principles are 
united, they might grow up more capable of giving equal respect to authority 
figures of both sexes? Why not give a non-patriarchal, dual-gendered deity a 
chance for, say, 500 years? If by then boys are still refusing to obey their 
mothers, if ideas expressed at meetings are still being accepted more readily 
if a man expresses them (even if he's only repeating exactly what a woman said 
moments earlier), if men are still justifying rape by saying, "She said no, but 
she meant yes," well, then, there's always the Goddess -- she who has feminine 
but not necessarily "decent" ways of dealing with man's insolence.

 * Being a female but not a feminist (and coincidentally a Presbyterian), I 
laud Prager's views against the re-imaging of God as a female deity, which is 
now the subject of a recent Presbyterian conference. I also see the rationale 
of Prager's opinion that the Bible is written within a patriarchal context for 
the purpose of igniting moral behavior in us. 
</P>
<P>
 Since my childhood, my perception of God has always been in masculine terms. 
We grew up in the tradition that the father was the head of the family, the one 
who wielded power, and who made the final decision. In retrospect, when we 
disobeyed our father, we feared his ire and we behaved. 
</P>
<P>
 Masculinity, physical strength, warrior qualities and being rule-oriented make 
males more akin to a God who is the father and the ruler. We females should not 
feel discriminated against because of a male depiction of God, but consider 
ourselves as creatures essential to males because we complement them with our 
virtues of kindness and compassion.

 * Prager is definitely from the planet Mars. Does he really believe that 
violent behavior among men will increase in our society if we use gender 
neutral or feminist words to describe God rather than the tradition masculine 
terms found in the Bible? If the goal of Judaism and Christianity can be 
reduced "to taming the evil beast in men," then historically each religion has 
not done a very good job achieving its objective.

 * Prager admits that God is neither male nor female, yet he is insistent on 
naming God as exclusively male, thereby deifying a gender. This is idolatry. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he has the audacity to threaten women with the wrath of men and 
boys if they don't have a male god to subdue them. Sorry, Dennis, your 
masculine pride is showing. The issue in keeping God male is not one of 
morality but of power.

COLUMN LEFT/ FRANK F. FURSTENBERG JR.: DON'T BLAME WELFARE FOR SOCIETY'S ILLS; 
OFFER POOR FAMILIES SUPPORT SERVICES TO HELP THEM BETTER THEIR LIVES, NOT 
ORPHANAGES TO HOUSE CHILDREN OF UNWED PARENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK F. FURSTENBERG JR., Frank F. Furstenberg Jr. is a professor of 
sociology at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost every week, I get a call from a journalist who wants to know why rates 
of teen-age childbearing in the United States are rising and would like me to 
explain the link between welfare and early childbearing or to comment on the 
tough measures that some states are enacting to discourage welfare dependency. 
Conservative social policy theorist Charles Murray's argument that stamping out 
welfare would stamp out teen-age childbearing seems to be catching on. The 
journalists are intrigued by his catchy proposal, endorsed by other 
conservative critics, to set up orphanages to raise children born to teen 
mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 I have deep reservations about Murray's ideas. I was one of scores of 
economists, demographers and sociologists who recently issued a public 
statement questioning the link between welfare and non-marital childbearing. We 
endorsed efforts to reform our system of granting public assistance, but warned 
that abolishing welfare would work to the detriment of children unless it were 
replaced by adequate support for impoverished families. Many of us doubt that 
reducing or even ending welfare would have much effect, if any, on 
out-of-wedlock births. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-marital childbearing has risen in the United States during the past two 
decades. The growth has not occurred exclusively among the young, the poor, 
minorities or even the disadvantaged. In fact, the rate of non-marital 
childbearing for African American teen-agers actually dropped or remained 
stable during most of the 1970s and '80s, while it increased steadily and 
rapidly for white women in their 20s and 30s. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing levels of non-marital childbearing do not reflect a greater penchant 
of unmarried children to have more children, as is commonly believed, but 
rather a lower propensity of unmarried women to marry, especially when they 
become pregnant. Moreover, what has been happening in the United States has 
occurred in nearly every Western nation.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost no expert on family change believes that welfare played anything more 
than a minor role in the transformation of the family or in reducing the 
confidence that Americans now place in the institution of marriage. For one 
thing, the generosity of public assistance has virtually nothing to do with the 
growth of non-marital childbearing. Out-of-wedlock childbearing has increased 
at the same time that welfare benefits have declined significantly in real 
dollars. Also, the level of benefits in various states is not related to the 
incidence of non-marital childbearing. Indeed, no reliable evidence shows that 
reducing or eliminating welfare altogether will make people stop having babies 
or marry when they become pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Would removing children from the homes of unmarried mothers stem the rise of 
out-of-wedlock childbearing or help the offspring of never-married parents have 
a better life? Apart from the dubious constitutionality, let's consider the 
wisdom of establishing orphanages for the children of unmarried parents. Our 
record of designing and supporting benevolent public institutions for 
disadvantaged children is dismal, to say the least. The quality of our 
inner-city schools, health facilities, recreational programs and social 
services leads me to conclude that low-income children are at least as well 
cared for by their parents as they are by public institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is going to pay for these new services? I don't see any of the advocates 
volunteering to raise taxes to fund current services for children, much less 
expand prenatal and neonatal care, day care or after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a counterproposal for Charles Murray and his band of child-savers. Why 
take children away from their parents? Instead, establish residential family 
centers to house low-income parents (mothers, fathers or other surrogate 
parents) and their children. Run them as cooperatives, giving the families 
supportive services such as parent education, health services, day care and 
recreational programs. Working parents would have a place to leave their 
children during the day and non-working parents would be expected to give more 
time and service in exchange for these benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Family cooperatives might be expensive, but not nearly as costly as 
orphanages. They would be less controversial, legally and politically, than 
severing children from their parents. By relieving some of the economic, social 
and psychological burdens on low-income parents, they might benefit children. 
Those who claim to worry about family preservation ought to consider lending 
parents a helping hand instead of promoting schemes to separate them from their 
children.

ASSEMBLYMAN ACCUSED OF SEX HARASSMENT IN LAWSUIT; LEGISLATURE: MICKEY CONROY OF 
ORANGE DENIES AN EX-CLERK'S ALLEGATIONS. HE IS BEST KNOWN FOR WRITING A BILL TO 
PADDLE GRAFFITI VANDALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy, the Orange County lawmaker who captured national 
headlines recently with a bill to paddle juvenile graffiti vandals, has been 
accused in a lawsuit of sexually harassing a former employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Robyn Boyd, a former part-time legislative clerk in Conroy's office, accused 
the Republican from Orange of subjecting her to "uninvited and unwelcome" 
harassment as well as an office environment replete with off-color jokes, 
innuendo and sexual advances, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy denied all the allegations, saying that Boyd's complaints resulted from 
"unfortunate misunderstandings" and that his office "addressed those matters by 
taking immediate corrective action where appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed in Amador County in March, but is being transferred this 
week to Sacramento County. Carolee Kilduff, Boyd's attorney, said the complaint 
was filed in the neighboring county to avoid publicity while settlement 
negotiations were under way with the Assembly Rules Committee, which also is 
named as a plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd, 35, is seeing a psychiatrist for emotional problems that she says she 
has suffered as a result of the harassment, Kilduff said. Although the lawsuit 
contends that Boyd was terminated from her job, officials in the Legislature 
said she was on unpaid administrative leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilduff said Boyd was told shortly after she was hired in March, 1993, that 
she should give Conroy back rubs as well as hugs and kisses. Conroy on several 
occasions draped an arm around Boyd and let his hand fall on her breast, 
Kilduff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also names Conroy's chief of staff, Pete Conaty, who allegedly 
told Boyd that she would be blackballed when she refused to back off her sexual 
harassment charges. The result was an intolerable work environment, the lawsuit 
alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd is seeking unspecified monetary damages for harassment and wrongful 
termination.

LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES; OFFENSE DESERTS NORTHRIDGE, 4-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Northridge, the only team from the Western Region to qualify for the World 
Series three times, is also the only team from the region to lose in the first 
round three times. 
</P>
<P>
 That dubious distinction was earned through a 4-2 loss to Brooklyn Center, 
Minn., on Monday night before 11,000. Right-hander Steve Kruger pitched a 
one-hitter, allowing only a home run to Northridge catcher Matt Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 However, this Northridge team has a profound advantage over its brethren from 
1975 and '67, years when series play was single-elimination. Because of a 
TV-friendly pool-play format, victories against Middleboro, Mass., today at 10 
a.m. PDT and against Springfield, Va., on Wednesday could vault Northridge into 
Thursday's national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teams with the best records after pool play advance, and the winner of 
that game will play in the World Series championship Saturday regardless of 
record. As with the College World Series, TV -- in this case ESPN -- wants a 
national championship game, no strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Should there be tie records after pool play, the team that has allowed the 
fewest runs advances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in it, so we're gonna tell all the wild people to shut up and go 
to bed so we get a good night's sleep," said Nathaniel Dunlap, the losing 
pitcher against Brooklyn Center despite being clocked at more than 70 m.p.h. 
consistently by a radar gun behind home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Two wild pitches in the fourth inning by Dunlap, a 5-foot-11 right-hander, 
enabled Brooklyn Center (12-1) to erase a 1-0 lead that Northridge (17-1) took 
on Cunningham's first inning home run. The home run was Cunningham's third in 
as many at-bats -- he hit two in the 10-run sixth inning against Hawaii that 
gave Northridge a 17-7 victory and the Western Regional championship on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Tauscheck led off the fourth with a single to left field and advanced to 
second on a wild pitch and to third on a ground out to second baseman Justin 
Gentile. After holding at third on a bunt single by Jermar Larkins, Tauscheck 
scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklyn Center added three runs with two out in the fifth to take a 4-1 lead. 
A double by Chris DeMars was followed by an RBI single by Kruger. 
</P>
<P>
 Tauscheck followed with a home run to left field, hitting a Dunlap fastball 
clocked at 71 m.p.h. Dunlap, who struck out 13 in six innings and was the only 
pitcher in the four games to reach 70 m.p.h, said some Brooklyn Center batters 
were peeking back at Cunningham's signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I should throw at their heads when they do that," Dunlap said, "but I 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge brought the winning run to the plate with two out in the bottom of 
the sixth, but cleanup hitter Spencer Gordon hit a slow roller to Kruger and 
was thrown out by a step. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Peter Tuber, 3-0 in regional play, will start today for 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In other games, Springfield, Va., the Southern Region champion, defeated 
Middleboro, Mass., the Eastern Region champion, 2-1, in eight innings on a solo 
home run by Ethan Lare. Chinese Taipei defeated Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, 4-1, 
behind the three-hit pitching of Hsiu-Fan Wu, and Maracaibo, Venezuela, 
defeated Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 5-1, on a one-hitter by Cesar Hidalgo.

MORNING BRIEFING: RAIDERS ENDED UP BEING 'IT' IN THIS GAME OF SEEK AND HIDE 
</P>

 How did the Denver Broncos sign former New England Patriot running back 
Leonard Russell when the Raiders had been the front-runners to sign him for 
weeks? 
</P>
<P>
 The old-fashioned way, according to the Boston Globe's Ron Borges: They hid 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Raiders negotiated with Russell's agent, Steve Feldman, Borges 
wrote, the Broncos had Russell practically under lock and key: 
</P>
<P>
 "While the Raiders were scrambling to reach Russell, he was stashed at the 
Denver Broncos' hotel in San Francisco from Thursday night until he agreed to a 
one-year-contract Friday evening." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Russell: And why were the Broncos so intent on getting Russell under 
contract? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Russell's effort, not to mention the Raiders' effort to sign him, that 
inspired Denver to make its move," according to Borges. "(Denver) Director of 
Football Operations Bob Ferguson once worked for the Buffalo Bills and recalled 
a game when all-pro defensive end Bruce Smith stormed into the locker room 
during Russell's rookie year and said to Coach Marv Levy, 'We can't tackle that 
man! You better figure out something.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Of Miami Dolphin Coach Don Shula's NFL-record 327 victories, how 
many were scored in postseason play? 
</P>
<P>
 Salisbury's stake: Former USC quarterback Sean Salisbury bristled recently 
when asked if he thought his role as backup to the Houston Oilers' Cody Carlson 
was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm as good a backup, if not the best, in the NFL," Salisbury said. "They 
expect me to be Superman, to jump over buildings. I don't mean to be arrogant, 
but I'm a heck of a football player. Check my track record." 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what Bob Glauber did for the Sporting News. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's see," Glauber wrote, "Salisbury was undrafted in 1986 and was signed as 
a free agent by the Seattle Seahawks that year but didn't play. Then, he joined 
the Indianapolis Colts' replacement team in 1987 and was cut the next summer. 
After spending two seasons in the Canadian Football League, Salisbury was 
signed by the Vikings in 1990 but didn't suit up for two seasons. Then, in 1992 
and '93 with Minnesota, he threw for a combined 1,616 yards, 14 touchdowns and 
eight interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow." 
</P>
<P>
 Two-year plan: Newsday's Mike Lupica decided to go to the person he figured 
was losing the most during the baseball strike -- Bobby Bonilla's wife, Millie 
Quinones Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla would be earning $31,148 a day from the New York Mets if he wasn't on 
strike.

LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES; OFFENSE DESERTS NORTHRIDGE, 4-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Kruger pitched a one-hitter and had the game-winning hit Monday night as 
Brooklyn Center, Minn., beat Northridge, 4-2, in the first round of the Little 
League World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Springfield, Va., beat Middleboro, Mass., 2-1, in the other American first 
round game when Ethan Lare homered to lead off the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan, back in the World Series for the first time since 1991, beat Glace 
Bay, Nova Scotia, 4-1, in the international opener and Eduardo Ferrer pitched a 
one-hitter and homered as Venezuela beat Saudi Arabia, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Since tournament play began last month, Kruger has been used exclusively as a 
reliever, working the sixth inning of most games and seldom working more than 
three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's our best pitcher. He has potentially the best stuff," manager Larry 
Wendell said. "We usually use him the sixth inning of every game, but we are at 
the end of the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Kruger's fifth-inning single broke a 1-1 tie, scoring Chris DeMars, who 
doubled and moved to third on a passed ball. Eric Tauscheck followed with a 
two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge scored a run in the sixth on Matthew Cunningham's groundout after 
Michael Frost walked and moved to third on a sacrifice and an error. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham homered in the first to give Northridge a 1-0 lead. Brooklyn Center 
tied the game in the fourth on Tauscheck's single, Krissy Wendell's grounder to 
second and two wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruger (1-0) struck out six. Nathaniel Dunlap (0-1) had 13 strikeouts for 
Northridge, which lost for the first time in 18 tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
 "To heck with those guys getting paid," Springfield manager Jim Hamilton said 
of striking major-league players after Lare won the game for the Southern 
champions. "This was a great ball game." 
</P>
<P>
 Lare lined a fastball over the fence in left-center to win the game for Paul 
Weishar (1-0), who replaced Lare as the starting pitcher for Springfield. Lare 
was moved to shortstop so he can pitch later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Brower (0-1) pitched a complete game in a losing effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleboro manufactured a run in the third after Patrick Hannon walked and 
Jake Kutzy singled to left. Brandon Soule sacrificed, and Hannon scored on 
Christian Perry's grounder. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth inning, Andrews walked and reached third, but came home without 
tagging up on Eric Miller's fly to right. When Andrews realized his mistake, it 
was too late for him to retreat to third. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just took off. They're 12-year-olds. They're going to make mistakes," 
Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 One batter later, Middleboro first baseman Brandon Brower threw home after 
fielding Roberto Carrero's grounder, but catcher Daryl Bradford didn't attempt 
a tag as Andrews slid beneath him safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews' mistake, however, kept pinch-runner Richie Kyle from taking third on 
Miller's fly ball. Otherwise, he could have scored on Carrero's grounder. 
</P>
<P>
 As both pitchers worked overtime, batters began to hit the ball more sharply. 
Carrero flied out to the wall for the final out in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Weishar struck out 14 and Brower had eight strikeouts.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 This has not been a terrific summer for the Lakers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't sign Horace Grant. They didn't sign Danny Manning. They didn't 
sign Dominique Wilkins. They are about to lose Doug Christie, who will undergo 
ankle surgery Wednesday, for at least training camp. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a chance that they will make a deal this week -- a draft choice 
or a player to Phoenix for Cedric Ceballos, who would become their starting 
small forward. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 At one time, the Lakers were trying to land both Grant and Manning. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Buss is still considered a players' owner, but the old Laker mystique is 
gone and Grant and Manning signed with teams -- Orlando and Phoenix, 
respectively -- that appear to be a lot closer to an NBA title. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers had little interest in Wilkins because of his age, 34. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers might sign free agent power forward Wayman Tisdale, the nine-year 
veteran who has played for Indiana and Sacramento. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tisdale was picked second by Indiana in the 1985 draft. Patrick Ewing was 
selected first by New York, and Benoit Benjamin third by the Clippers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 How shocking that Rick Pitino's name hasn't surfaced in speculation about the 
next coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Darlene May, who coached Cal Poly Pomona to three NCAA Division II basketball 
titles and is battling cancer, used to live on Wooden Ave. in Placentia. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a Nell Lane in the same Orange County town. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that Ed Powell, a former assistant coach to John Wooden at UCLA, was 
city manager when the streets were named in the honor of the Wizard of Westwood 
and his wife. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams could do worse than hiring a proven winner such as Charles Mann. . .

 It took Emmitt Smith about two seconds to flash midseason form during his 
first game of the exhibition season against the Denver Broncos on Sunday. . . .

 Perry Klein, the former Southland high school and Cal quarterback who finished 
his college career at C.W. Post, has won the Atlanta Falcons' third-string job 
over veteran Bob Gagliano. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jim Sweeney says 6-foot-4, 310-pound Jason James, who has been switched 
from center to tackle, is Fresno State's best offensive linemen ever. The 
former Buena Park High player will return to Orange County for the Disneyland 
Pigskin Classic against Ohio State on Monday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Former USC tailback Allen Carter has become coach at Anaheim High, where he 
will inherit one of the best running backs in the Southland, junior Reuben 
Droughns, who gained 2,039 yards as a sophomore. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Max Mikhailovsky, the L.A. Blade goaltender who will face the Anaheim 
Bullfrogs in Roller Hockey International playoff games tonight at The Pond of 
Anaheim and Wednesday at the Forum, has been invited to the Kings' training 
camp. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kennedy, the former Indiana performer who set an American record in the 
3,000 meters recently, could become the best U.S. distance runner since Steve 
Prefontaine. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Pity those who bet a Soviet Problem-Mamselle Bebette exacta Sunday at Del Mar 
and got a $2.40 return instead of $2.80 on a Soviet Problem bet in the match 
race. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The mutuel takeout is far bigger on exotic bets, such as the exacta, than on 
flat bets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The fair thing would have been for Del Mar to offer only win betting. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 John Longden, 88, recently wowed a luncheon audience by rattling off the 
fractions of a race he won aboard Count Fleet in 1942. Longden still believes 
that the 1943 Triple Crown winner was the greatest thoroughbred ever. . . .

 It was nice that Julie Krone won her first Grade I race in more than a year 
Sunday at Saratoga, the same track where she was seriously injured last Aug.

 Boxing historian Dick Mastro says that if Rafael (Bazooka) Limon really is 
only 35, he would have been 13 when he began his pro boxing career. . . .

 Jerry Nathanson, who died last week at 83, did something many other State 
Athletic commissioners haven't over the years. He attended boxing matches 
regularly. . . .

 When Julio Cesar Borboa defends his International Boxing Federation super 
flyweight title against Harold Grey on Monday, it will be the 12th anniversary 
show for Buss' Forum Boxing, Inc., and the 218th consecutive card without a 
cancellation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Now that his Nov. 5 heavyweight title bout against Michael Moorer is on again, 
George Foreman has resumed vigorous training, told publicist Bill Caplan not to 
schedule any interviews for the next two weeks and set a goal of trimming to 
235 pounds. . . .

POP MUSIC REVIEW; HOUSTON FINDS VOICE BY GETTING PERSONAL; AFTER A SHAKY START, 
WHITNEY SHOWS SUBSTANCE WITH LATE-'60S GOSPEL, R&B 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheeee . . . ee-ee . . . ee-ee will always love us. That, we know. 
</P>
<P>
 But is Whitney Houston evergreen? 
</P>
<P>
 Premiering with great fanfare on television Sunday was the Barbra Streisand 
cable special, filmed principally at the former funny lady's final show at the 
Pond of Anaheim a month ago. Appearing in person at the same arena, meanwhile, 
was arguably the most naturally gifted pop vocalist of a subsequent generation, 
diva-in-waiting Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
 And inescapably, given the timing and venue, at least, Houston was facing some 
substantial footsteps to follow. For anyone truly interested in charting a 
comparison between these two leading ladies of successive eras, the odds 
pointed toward anticlimax. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston's show (rescheduled from its original July date because of the 
singer's throat ailment) certainly started badly, if slickly, with all the 
dispiriting earmarks of a prematurely rote, Vegas-style revue. Yet she pulled 
it out of the bag in a big way, eventually loosening up and letting more of a 
playful, spontaneous personality shine through, while retreating from the hits 
to less obligatory material that clearly held far more personal meaning for 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 And like -- yes -- Barbra, Whitney now spends a fair amount of stage time 
ruminating on her personal life as well as the public perception of it. (Severe 
ego-phobes need not apply in either case, obviously.) Whereas Streisand's 
presentation of self is carefully scripted, though, Houston's is messy; she 
seems alternately guarded or extemporaneous in ways that are frustrating and 
fascinating. At least, unlike some of her melismatic rivals on the charts, 
there seems to be a there there. 
</P>
<P>
 The there is publicly tough, through and through; there is no waxing 
vulnerable. When Houston defends herself and her husband, Bobby Brown, against 
tabloid accounts of their supposedly rocky relationship ("I am a woman in love, 
and I have a man in love with me. You know how I know? 'Cause I give him every 
reason to stay home"), she's cocky on behalf of family. When she moves into 
gospel territory, she's cocky for the Lord. 
</P>
<P>
 You might wish for just a small crack in all this emotional armor, without 
necessarily asking her to succumb to the tragedian instincts of divas past. 
(Houston did get teary once -- not on her own behalf but while noting that the 
children of O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson were in the audience and had 
sent her flowers. When she asked for a spotlight to be put on the presumably 
unsuspecting Simpson kids, it was a classically weird, mortifying moment.) 
</P>
<P>
 But if anyone has the material goods to convincingly carry off 
stoutheartedness, it's Houston. By her own admission, she wasn't in top voice 
Sunday, and she had to ask for the Pond's air conditioning to be shut off at 
mid-set to protect herself from the draft. That said, she approached sheer 
vocal perfection at virtually every turn. If ever before she succumbed to the 
temptation to over-sing, at this seasoned date she consistently finds just the 
right impressive peaks and exquisite valleys without ever unduly extending a 
phrase past what it's worth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half of the show, she got to apply that astonishing instrument 
to some material worthy of it. By way of paying homage to her mother, Cissy 
Houston's, vocal quartet, the Sweet Inspirations, Houston launched into a long 
medley of late-'60s secular and gospel oldies, starting with the Aretha 
Franklin smash "A Natural Woman," whose original vocal arrangements were done 
by the senior Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitable conclusion: Whitney was born 20 years too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades too late, that is, to be consistently provided with the kind of 
material (and overall career guidance, perhaps) that would do justice to her 
full talent. Watching her progress emotionally through a gospel standard or 
great '60s R&B ballad made it all the more difficult to see Houston go back and 
end the show as she began it -- with peppy but decidedly unmoving up-tempo 
numbers, augmented by Bobby Brown's female dancers in workout gear, or by doing 
balladry more suited to contemporary Broadway than the stuff of classic soul. 
</P>
<P>
 There were several mostly vain attempts to get the crowd on its feet during 
the perfunctory likes of "I Wanna Dance With Somebody," when what we really 
wanted was more of Houston off her feet -- on a stool, recalling 'Retha and 
Mom, sultrily pulling down the scrim that separates potential greatness from 
greatness. It's within her grasp, but even Streisand would have a hard time 
meeting her potential if she were 31 and forced to conform to the expectations 
of 1994.

 That's a little theme song the California Countryfest and Rodeo is welcome to, 
if they hold one again next year. Let's hope they do, because last weekend's 
event certainly turned standing around in a big dirt field into a more 
interesting experience than it ordinarily is. 
</P>
<P>
 One couldn't help but be struck Sunday by the dichotomy of holding a rodeo in 
an area where most people only see their livestock wrapped in cellophane at the 
supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 There were cowpokes toting beepers and cellular phones, and sporting clothes 
that likely cost more than the Ponderosa did. Instead of all the roping and 
riding, given the citified affluence it may have been more appropriate if the 
rodeo had offered something more along the lines of a veal-breading event. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, it was an ambitious fest, organized by some of the same folks who 
put on the Dana Point Blues Festival last year. Along with bovine celebrity 
Ricky the Bull, the event lined up big-name performers and choice local musical 
talent along with several restaurant booths and vendor booths offering 
everything from chic Western wear to chiropractic services. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rodeo stands were filled Sunday night, attendance overall fell short 
of quite being Moostock. In the hot afternoon, the sparse population made the 
Buchheim Field site seem especially vast, and, given the wide gaps between 
events, one did indeed have a lot of time to wonder, " Why am I standing around 
in a big dirt field?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Countryfest organizers did have the savvy to hire some of the best local 
country talent, including D.D. Wood, who appeared Saturday, and Rosie Flores 
and Chris Gaffney, who performed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Gaffney and his band the Cold Hard Facts can still be found playing in 
local county bars such including the Canyon Inn and the Swallows, his is a 
world-class talent. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a lived-in voice that is the perfect conduit for his lyrics, which are 
some of the most distinctive in country. His 10-song set included tunes of 
woozy celebration, but also painfully real tales of neighborhood violence, 
domestic dead-zones and faltering lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Those included " '68," a song he penned with Dave Alvin about a man still 
living with the memory of a best friend lost in Vietnam, and "Silent Partner," 
an up-tempo but deeply sad song about a marriage where the lines of 
communication have dried up.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No more cheerful was "Quiet Desperation," Gaffney's lyric about a man living 
with self-recrimination and loss following his wife's suicide: 
</P>
<P>
 What will I tell the babies when they ask  
</P>
<P>
 Why mama had to leave her future and her past  
</P>
<P>
 They've got to know they're free of any guilt or blame  
</P>
<P>
 For me I know that won't be any children's game It's a painful, moving song, 
but its performance only proved that determined people can line dance to just 
about anything. There Gaffney and his band were, singing about death and 
despair, and folks were boot-scootin' and tush-pushin' away.  
</P>
<P>
 At least he played to a fair-sized audience. Flores originally had been 
scheduled to appear right after Gaffney (she was on the main stage, and he was 
on a second one), but her performance wasn't allowed to start until 90 minutes 
after Gaffney finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did that leave a lot of down-time for folks again to ponder that big 
dusty field, but it also meant that by the time she did play, most people had 
headed off to hold down seats in the rodeo bleachers.  
</P>
<P>
 Though there weren't many there to hear it, Flores' set was an excellent 
showcase of the singer-songwriter's many strengths. She has a voice that is, by 
turns, gutsy, whimsical and tender, and songs that require that range.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of the set was drawn from her current Hightone album "Once More With 
Feeling," including the infectious show-opener "Someday." As that song ended, 
an Amtrak train barreled by the rodeo grounds, and Flores took advantage of its 
rhythm to launch into an impromptu version of Johnny Cash's "Folsom Prison 
Blues."  
</P>
<P>
 Other songs included her current video pick "Honky Tonk Moon," the spunky "Try 
Me" with its "Honky Tonk Women" mood, and "Crying Over You." Gaffney joined her 
on vocals and accordion on Ray Price's "Crazy Arms" and on Harlan Howard and 
Bobby Braddock's remarkably bitter country ode, "God May Forgive You (But I 
Won't)." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores had to spend the tail end of her set competing with the noise of the 
rodeo announcer coming from across the field, where the rodeo had commenced. 
One might have thought rodeos would be the one sporting event that would remain 
impervious to Queen's "We Will Rock You" anthem, but there it was, blasting 
away.  
</P>
<P>
 When the day's headliner, Doug Stone, finally appeared, he was a true misery. 
Had one of the rodeo horses performed as lamely, he likely would be going on a 
little field trip to the glue factory today.  
</P>
<P>
 Stone has had a number of hits, which is a scary indicator of how little 
talent has to do with success in country today because, simply put, Stone can't 
sing for squat. 
</P>
<P>
 From his opening number, an insipid, lifeless cover of J.J. Cale's "After 
Midnight," and through hits of his own such as "A Jukebox With a Country Song" 
and "I'd Be Better Off in a Pine Box," Stone's voice kept landing way off pitch 
and the emotional content was as phony as the stage fog washing over the stage.

UNEASY STREET; SOME NEW THREATS IN OLD PLACES CREATE 'ANXIETY' FOR THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A child at play is slain by random gunfire. A carjacker shoots a motorist in 
broad daylight at a busy intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Foods we once enjoyed with impunity are labeled hazardous to your health. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '90s, "much of what we are surrounded by is a threat," says Bonnie 
Earls-Solari, curator of "Anxiety: View of Contemporary Life," a group 
exhibition at the BankAmerica Gallery in Costa Mesa that attempts to shine 
light on these dark times. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of what we read in the news has to do with people who are no longer 
secure doing things that were once thought to be" perfectly safe, Earls-Solari 
says. "Sitting and watching TV in our own homes, driving in our cars, breathing 
the air, eating the things we eat. . . . People sometimes begin to feel that 
every aspect of their life is under attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Representational and expressionistic paintings, prints, photographs and 
drawings by 20 artists make up "Anxiety." Images of society's hapless victims 
abound and a sense of insidious malevolence lurks like a cat burglar. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the works date from the 1980s, during which time BankAmerica Corp. and 
Security Pacific Corp. independently acquired the bulk of their respective art 
collections. Those collections were combined when the banks merged two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern-day Angst "has not just happened," Earls-Solari said in recent phone 
interview from her San Francisco office. "It developed over a period of time 
and references to it can be found in a number of earlier works." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Bosman's prints best represent the show's main theme of new threats in 
old places, the curator said. In "Drowning Man I" (1981), for instance, an 
innocent ocean dip has turned topsy-turvy for a frantic figure seen upside 
down, underwater, his panicked eyes open wide, his mouth agape in a silent 
scream. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Evil literally hits closer to home in a satiric comic-strip-like lithograph by 
Glen Baxter that depicts father and daughter at the dinner table. His face is 
splattered with debris from a mangled "exploding fork" he holds over a plate of 
meat, peas and potatoes in "It Was the Fourth Time that Daddy Had Fallen for 
the Exploding Fork Routine" (1984). 
</P>
<P>
 Urban alienation is personified by Leo Rubinfein's haunting photograph, "Hong 
Kong" (1980), Earls-Solari said. A man and his dog stand on a wharf watching 
whitecaps and boats pitch about on a windy day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have become cut off from lots of things that provide a sense of community 
and family support and confidence in our society that things would be OK," she 
said. "In some of the works, there are no people, which almost magnifies that 
isolation, that emptiness." 
</P>
<P>
 One such unpopulated piece also bespeaks the "ambiguity" and "uncertainty," 
Earls-Solari said, of modern life, which can be shaken one day by earthquakes, 
the next by a scientific discovery that shatters previous theories (such as one 
recently refuting evolution's uninterrupted, steady pace) or condemns decaf. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollis Sigler's "No Longer Dreaming" (1983), everything's akimbo in a 
couple's unoccupied bedroom -- inexplicably under siege -- where the bed's 
a-rockin' and a-rollin' and tea is tossed like a sideways waterfall from a cup 
thrown from a toppling bedside table. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't really know what caused it, what happened to turn that bedroom 
upside down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar unseen malevolent forces are the trademark of one of the show's 
best-known artists: New Yorker Robert Longo, once dubbed by L.A. Times art 
critic William Wilson as the master of Apocalyptic Pop, whose art "decries a 
culture that maneuvers its citizens like so many widgets." 
</P>
<P>
 On display are three large black-and-white prints from Longo's signature "Men 
in the Cities" series, circa 1980. Grimacing yuppies, dressed in constrictive 
office wear, writhe and twist in painfully unnatural positions. The question 
has always been what invisible force causes their tortured contortions and 
makes them appear like marionettes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The works symbolize "the individual out of balance," said Earls-Solari, adding 
that societal malaise may not have been uppermost in the mind of every artist 
in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things about looking at art is that you bring to it your own 
viewing history," she said. "There are themes in some of the works that were 
not threatening in 1982 or 1987 but can be viewed that way today. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't necessarily a show that will make people laugh," she said. "But it 
might prompt reflection and make people look at their own feelings about this." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Anxiety: Views of Contemporary Life" runs through Oct. 14 at the 
BankAmerica Gallery, 555 Anton Blvd., 4055, Costa Mesa. Gallery hours: Monday 
through Friday, 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Free. (714) 433-6000.

the pandering and drug possession trial, scheduled to begin in Los Angeles next 
month. Court TV CEO Steven Brill said the Fleiss trial "lacks any important 
legal issues." He also said he is wary of giving live coverage to the potential 
reading of a list of clients that Fleiss has hinted at revealing.

 On Tap for KCAL: KCAL Channel 9 is dropping its 7-8 p.m. newscast next month 
and will air the syndicated "Top Cops," a reality-based police show, and "Rush 
Limbaugh" in its place. The show featuring Limbaugh moves to KCAL from KCOP 
Channel 13. In other changes, all beginning the week of Sept. 12, KCAL has 
renewed "The Marilyn Kagan Show," airing the program with psychotherapist Kagan 
at 9 a.m. weekdays, and will also add "The Susan Powter Show," featuring the 
energetic diet guru, to its lineup at 5 p.m. "Jones & Jury," a syndicated 
courtroom show with former NBC legal correspondent Star Jones, will follow at 
5:30 p.m. A newly formatted "Rolonda," featuring Rolonda Watts, moves to 10 
a.m. The show promises to be geared more toward news stories than to 
traditional talk-show fare.

 Anti-Violence Campaign: Three Turner networks -- TNT, the Cartoon Network and 
the TBS Superstation -- are teaming up to fight violence. The networks will 
produce a series of anti-violence specials and public service announcements 
scheduled to begin in late August and early September. TNT will kick-off the 
campaign Friday during the scheduled NFL game with the first of its ads 
featuring stories of real people who are taking a stand against violence. Poet 
Maya Angelou narrates one such ad. The Cartoon Network will air its "Take a 
Beat" spots, which remind young people to stop and think to diffuse a 
potentially violent situation. And TBS will air "TV Violence: Parents Under the 
Gun," a special addressing violence on TV, on Sept. 30 at 7:35 p.m. STAGE

 Suited Up: Peter Falk, Joe Mantegna and Dan Lauria will perform in a free 
public reading of Jason Milligan's play "Men in Suits," at the Canon Theatre in 
Beverly Hills on Wednesday at 8 p.m. The comedy is about two Mafia hit men who 
have to confront the "Boss" after bungling a job. The reading is an encore 
presentation -- the play was originally read as part of Patchett Kaufman 
Entertainment Theatre's Monday night reading series at the Westwood Playhouse. 
The audience will be seated on a first-come, first-serve basis. POP/ROCK

 Campbell Arrested: Police arrested rapper Luther Campbell and eight dancers as 
they ran from a Birmingham, Ala., nightclub after a performance that included 
simulated sex acts and ended when audience members pelted police with bottles. 
Campbell was charged with inciting to riot Saturday at Club XS. The dancers, 
four women and four men, were charged with obscene, lewd and indecent conduct. 
All nine were released after posting bail on the misdemeanor charges.

 The Blue Danube Rockfest: A Woodstock reunion festival on an island in the 
Danube in Budapest that is rocking to Jethro Tull and the Grandmothers of 
Invention is turning out to be a pretty popular, if not financial, success. By 
Sunday night, 64,000 tickets had been sold to Eurowoodstock, making it almost 
certain that attendance will fall below the expected 150,000, organizer Arpad 
Stoll said. As a result, the event, which is scheduled to cost $750,000, is 
likely to lose money. Eurowoodstock opened following Woodstock '94 in New York 
earlier this month. QUICK TAKES

 Singer John Denver was under investigation for drunken driving after an 
accident in Aspen, Colo., that left him with head and facial cuts. The Colorado 
state patrol is investigating. Last September, Denver paid a $50 fine and sang 
at a benefit after he was convicted of driving while impaired. . . . Capitol 
Records will release "Nat King Cole: The Greatest Hits," featuring 22 Cole 
favorites, on Oct. 18. The collection includes the original 1951 version of 
"Unforgettable" as well as the 1993 digitally mixed duet between the late Cole 
and his daughter Natalie. . . . The ComedySportz National Tournament, America's 
largest improv competition with teams from 22 cities including Los Angeles, 
opened Monday in Milwaukee. The festival, which ends with a championship match 
on Saturday, is geared toward families. . . . Marlon Brando says he has written 
his memoirs so his children can separate the truth from the myths about him. 
"Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," written in collaboration with former New 
York Times correspondent Robert Lindsey, will be in stores on Sept. 7. . . .

TV REVIEWS; MTV TAKES LOOK AT DRUG USE IN NEWS REPORT 'STRAIGHT DOPE'; MTV HAS 
USUALLY TENDED TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION WHEN IT COMES TO THE POSSIBILITY 
OF PROMOTING ILLICIT DRUG USE 
</P>

 electronically scrambling, for example, the marijuana emblems that show up 
with smoke-alarming regularity on major gangsta rappers' caps and shirts in 
videos these days, as if they had endorsement contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's just a bit of a surprise that "Straight Dope: An MTV News Special 
Report" -- an hour special hosted and written by Kurt Loder -- finally comes 
down implicitly but palpably on the pro-pot, or at least pro-legalization, 
side. Imagining what goes on behind the scenes, one assumes this must have been 
quite a hemp -- er, hump -- for the network to get over. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically for MTV News, there's plenty of balance in the actual reporting. On 
the relatively benign marijuana front, an Oklahoma teen in a Pink Floyd shirt 
who claims to responsibly smoke the weed once or twice a week with no cravings 
or side effects is repeatedly contrasted with a young member of Marijuana 
Addicts Anonymous (seen only in silhouette) who claims reefer abuse turned her 
into "a potato"; the final effect is to suggest that dope is no worse than 
tobacco, caffeine or alcohol as long as you don't use it every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Harder drugs are treated more harshly across the board, with Loder offering 
warnings aplenty in individual segments on cocaine, heroin and psychedelics. 
There's certainly no glamour in watching an English lass aim her needle toward 
the black spot on her arm, and a paralyzed young victim of a crack-related 
shooting in New York recount his tale of woe. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Loder asks, "If cocaine were controlled like alcohol rather than banned 
outright, would Keon Brown be in a wheelchair today?" He pits a DEA agent's 
viewpoint versus the legendary taped remarks of controversial Surgeon General 
Joycelyn Elders, and visits idyllic Amsterdam, where he buys dope legally at a 
nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Loder's summary leaves little doubt where he stands: "Some people have always 
taken drugs, and they always will. Most are experimenting, and a relatively 
small number become addicts. Drug prohibition has not only had little effect on 
this phenomenon, it's actually made matters worse by effectively promoting 
crime and violence." 
</P>
<P>
 It's interesting to theorize, as Loder does, about how controlled legalization 
might well drastically reduce the violent-crime trade in our inner cities. But 
it's also interesting to theorize -- as Loder neglects to -- about what effect 
the tacit approval of the state might have on the masses of addictive 
personalities in the hinterlands who currently don't wind up abusing drugs 
simply because the substances aren't legally and easily available to them.

 If you're hearing a plaintive, "there's nothing to do," from your 
vacationed-out offspring, try one of these entertaining, participatory 
instructional videos. (Couch potatoes need not apply.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Art Lessons for Children With Donna Hugh, Vol. 5: Animals of the Rain 
Forest." Break out the watercolors and pastels -- art teacher Donna Hugh is 
back with more projects for kids (and any adult with a secret yen to pick up a 
paint brush). 
</P>
<P>
 Without an ounce of show-biz razzmatazz, Hugh comes off like a comfortable, 
artsy grandma with a real respect for kids' intelligence as she leads viewers 
in three separate art lessons: "The Toucan," "The Iguana" and "The Tamandua." 
Her reassuring, unpatronizing "it's OK" attitude, her unflashy, easy-to-follow 
real-time demonstrations, and some brief, informative live-action bits about 
the animals and the rain forest make for a terrific way to spend some creative 
quality time.

 If you've been searching for a Spanish-language children's video for ages 
about 2 to 8, "Spanish Club: Los Animales!" from Peapod Productions' "Look, 
Listen and Learn" series, is chock-full of quality educational entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Host (and Spanish curriculum specialist) Jennifer Reyes and a small group of 
multiethnic children use and hear Spanish in an unforced format that includes a 
comic puppet version of "The Three Little Pigs," tuneful songs and live-action 
film clips at the zoo and on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Children with an interest in learning the language and those who are 
Spanish-speaking are well-served with this polished bilingual effort. Also 
available: "Spanish Club: Fiesta!"

 "Sign Songs" is a thoroughly engaging music-storytelling video for both 
hearing and hard-of-hearing children. Humor is the primary ingredient in songs 
such as "Rhino," "My Mother's Snoring" and "Alligator Rag" ("don't get caught 
with your pants down when alligator around"). Written and performed by Ken 
Lonnquist and John Kinstler (a former member of the National Theatre of the 
Deaf), the upbeat songs offer creative, irresistible word play for expanding 
vocabularies in both spoken word and sign language.

TV REVIEWS; SOMETHING LOST, SOMETHING GAINED IN STREISAND CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rule 1 in pop music: Concerts are never as good on TV as they are in person. 
Rule 2 in pop music: Barbra Streisand breaks a lot of rules. 
</P>
<P>
 So, which rule applied Sunday night when the year's most acclaimed concert 
tour finally reached the nation's living rooms via HBO? 
</P>
<P>
 "Barbra Streisand: The Concert" -- which was largely shot last month at the 
Pond of Anaheim -- was a case of something lost, something gained. The primary 
loss from the live shows -- and it was substantial -- was much of the 
overriding sense of ambition and drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama of Streisand's tour grew out of the energy and enthusiasm of 
thousands of fans each night seeing the first series of live shows in more than 
two decades by a singer-icon who had avoided the concert stage for so long, in 
part because of stage fright. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambition resulted from the marvelously personal nature of the show itself: 
both the thematic design -- a warm blending of music and dialogue that spoke 
about everything from childhood daydreams to relationships -- as well as an 
inviting, tea-room stage set. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of these elements was fully captured in the telecast, where both the 
energy of the crowd and the nuances of the show itself were frequently 
neutralized. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the special effects -- including Streisand singing along with footage 
of Marlon Brando from the film "Guys and Dolls" and singing with herself from 
"Yentl" -- worked wonderfully. Compared to the original production, however, 
this was like a sampler, albeit a classy one. It was not precisely the way we 
were. 
</P>
<P>
 What was gained on HBO was a more revealing glimpse of Streisand the singer. 
In the large arena setting, you were touched mostly by the grace of her manner 
and the beauty of her voice. Up close Sunday, you got an intimate view of a 
performer who felt liberated and free -- and it was a joy to behold. ROBERT 
HILBURN

NORTHRIDGE BATS STYMIED; BASEBALL: ALL-STAR TEAM IS LIMITED TO ONE HIT BY 
MINNESOTA PITCHER IN 4-2 DEFEAT IN THE FIRST ROUND OF LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD 
SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Northridge, the only Little League from the Western Region to qualify teams 
for the World Series three times, is now the only league from the region to 
lose in the first round three times. 
</P>
<P>
 That distinction was earned through a 4-2 loss to Brooklyn Center., Minn., 
Monday night before 11,000 at Howard J. Lamade Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Steve Kruger pitched a one-hitter, allowing only a home run to 
Northridge catcher Matt Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 However, this Northridge team has a profound advantage over its brethren from 
1975 and '67, years when World Series play followed a single-elimination 
format. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a TV-friendly pool-play format involving eight teams, victories 
against Middleboro, Mass., today at 10 a.m. PDT and against Springfield, Va., 
Wednesday could vault Northridge into Thursday's U.S. championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 The two U.S. teams with the best records after pool play meet, and the winner 
of that game will play in the World Series championship game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the College World Series, TV -- in this case ESPN -- wants a 
championship game, no strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Should there be tie records after pool play, the team that has allowed the 
fewest runs advances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in it, so we're gonna tell all the wild people to shut up and go 
to bed so we can get a good night's sleep," said Nathaniel Dunlap, the losing 
pitcher against Brooklyn Center despite being clocked at more than 70 m.p.h. by 
a radar gun behind home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 However, wild pitches in the fourth inning by Dunlap, a 5-foot-11 
right-hander, enabled Brooklyn Center (12-1) to erase a 1-0 lead given 
Northridge (17-1) on Cunningham's first-inning home run.  
</P>
<P>
 The home run was Cunningham's third in as many at-bats -- he hit two in the 
10-run sixth inning against Hawaii that gave Northridge a 17-7 victory Friday 
and the Western Regional title. 
</P>
<P>
 In fourth inning against Dunlap, Eric Tauscheck led off with a single to left 
field and advanced to second on a wild pitch and to third on a groundout to 
second baseman Justin Gentile.  
</P>
<P>
 After holding at third on a bunt single by Jermar Larkins, Tauscheck scored on 
a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklyn Center added three runs with two out in the fifth to take a 4-1 lead. 
A double by Chris DeMars was followed by a run-scoring single by Kruger. 
</P>
<P>
 Tauscheck followed with a home run to left field, tying into a Dunlap fastball 
clocked at 71 m.p.h.  
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, who struck out 13 in six innings and was the only pitcher in the four 
games Monday to reach 70 m.p.h, said that some Brooklyn Center batters were 
peeking back at Cunningham's signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I should throw at their heads when they do that," Dunlap said, "but I 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge brought the winning run to the plate with two out in the bottom of 
the sixth, but cleanup hitter Spencer Gordon hit a slow roller to Kruger and 
was thrown out by a step. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Frost walked to open the sixth and advanced when catcher Krissy 
Wendell made a throwing error to second on a bunt by Gregg Wallis.  
</P>
<P>
 With one out, Cunningham hit a ground ball to second baseman Mike Langhoff, 
who lunged and tagged a diving Wallis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he touched (Wallis), but they made such a big deal about not 
running onto the field and questioning calls, that I didn't say anything," said 
Larry Baca, the Northridge manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost scored on the play to pull Northridge to within 4-2, but Gordon grounded 
out after a walk to Dunlap. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our best hitters up with a chance to tie or win the game," Baca said. 
"You can't ask for more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Excellent defense by Brooklyn Center short-circuited a potential rally in the 
fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham walked on four pitches to lead off, and Dunlap drilled a line drive 
on which center fielder Larkins made a diving catch.  
</P>
<P>
 Gordon then smashed a line drive up the middle that Kruger speared at knee 
level. Cunningham was easily doubled off first. 
</P>
<P>
 After Northridge swept through district, section, division and region play 
without a loss, the test will be to play well after being defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Peter Tuber, 3-0 in regional play, will start today for 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 In other games Monday, Springfield, the Southern Region champion, defeated 
Middleboro, the Eastern Region champion, 2-1, in eight innings on a solo home 
run by Ethan Lare. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleboro managed two hits against Paul Weishar but played solid defense.  
</P>
<P>
 Middleboro's Kevin Brower pitched a complete game and will be ineligible to 
pitch against Northridge.  
</P>
<P>
 However, his identical twin, Brandon Brower, is expected to start. 
</P>
<P>
 Among international teams, Chinese Taipei defeated Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, 
4-1, behind the three-hit pitching of Hsiu-Fan Wu. Maracaibo, Venezuela, 
defeated Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 5-1, on a one-hitter by Cesar Hidalgo.

THEY'RE ABUZZ IN PCL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Stahoviak is too excited about Salt Lake's Pacific Coast League pennant 
hopes to worry about whether the strike delays his return to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 While parent Minnesota has been idled by the dispute, the Triple-A Buzz has 
become the PCL's class act. Locked in a tight Northern Division race with 
Vancouver, Stahoviak and his teammates are being cheered on by the league's top 
crowds at gleaming new Franklin Quest Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really has been unbelievable," he said. "The facilities are better than 
anything I've seen in the minor-league parks. It's been pretty much 'story 
book' for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Salt Lake's success in its inaugural season has made the strike bearable for 
Stahoviak, who had his first taste of the majors when briefly called up by the 
Twins as a pinch-hitter last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Batting .325 with 12 homers and a team-leading 36 doubles going into the 
weekend, the 24-year-old third baseman was hoping for another callup before the 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really look at it as a missed opportunity to get to the majors," 
Stahoviak said. "They're doing it for us. I just hope everything works out, but 
I'm still backing the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Denny Hocking and outfielder Marty Cordova also possibly had 
prospects for a trip to the majors derailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't get called up this year, then you still have the PCL title to 
play for and that's exciting," said Hocking, batting .286 with 13 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordova, hitting .344, agrees that playing in a pennant race -- any pennant 
race -- makes delayed major-league dreams easier to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look to do well today, and the next at-bat," he said. "And it's nice to 
play in front of 10,000 every game." 
</P>
<P>
 Cordova is not exaggerating. The Buzz are averaging 10,042 fans, having 
reached the season's peak -- so far -- at 16,015 on June 18 against Tucson. No 
other PCL team comes close: Albuquerque is second at 5,436. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Salt Lake is well on the way to rewriting the PCL record for season 
attendance of 670,563 set in 1946 by the San Francisco Seals. The Buzz topped 
650,000 on Friday, with four more home dates left in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to break that record. I'm hoping we can hit 700,000," owner Joe 
Buzas said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the strike appears not to have affected attendance, which has remained 
constant. As for exposure, Twins fans saw their farm club beat Las Vegas 17-4 
last Tuesday thanks to Midwest Sports Channel, but the Salt Lake franchise 
realized no revenues from the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Local television contracted to carry just five regular-season games and no 
more have been scheduled, Buzz officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not bother Buzas, who acknowledges his Salt Lake team is too far 
away from a major-league city -- the nearest, Denver, is 500 miles to the east 
-- to directly benefit from the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 But 53 years as a club owner and player, including a brief stint with the New 
York Yankees in 1945, gives Buzas little patience for baseball's labor 
standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think both sides are real stupid -- it's a ridiculous situation. They 
haven't got anything right yet," Buzas said. "I've told the owners, 'Despite 
you people, baseball flourishes."' 
</P>
<P>
 He has only to look out on Franklin Quest Field, boasting minor-league 
baseball's best view with the Wasatch Mountains dominating the western skyline, 
to reinforce that belief -- and a dream again of a PCL title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a hell of a chance," Buzas declared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our pitching has been good sometimes and then the hitting is lousy, and then 
the hitting is good and the pitching is lousy. If we can get it together, we 
have a good chance."

NEWSWIRE: BULLS' PAXSON RETIRES AFTER 11-YEAR CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Paxson, a key part of three Chicago Bulls' championship teams, announced 
his retirement Monday, ending an 11-year NBA career. 
</P>
<P>
 Paxson, a 1983 graduate of Notre Dame, was signed as a free agent by the Bulls 
in 1985.He was a third-round draft pick of the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Paxson, who appeared in 772 regular-season games and 119 playoff games for the 
Bulls, is best remembered for making a three-point shot with 3.9 seconds left 
in Game 6 of the 1993 finals. The shot ensured the Bulls of a victory over the 
Phoenix Suns and a third consecutive NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Paxson said he will remain with the Bulls as a radio commentator, work with 
the team's guards, attend coaching meetings and learn the workings of the front 
office. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Lakers and Phoenix Suns are discussing a trade that would send former Cal 
State Fullerton standout Cedric Ceballos back to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Sedale Threatt is a top candidate to be traded because he can also be a 
backup point guard, one of the Suns' needs, and is close to Ceballos in salary. 
Ceballos, a small forward, will make $2.1 million in 1994-95, but the Lakers' 
best slot under the salary cap is $1.75 million. He could agree to give back 
the $350,000 to help the deal, although that cannot happen before Friday 
because of a salary cap technicality. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; HEAVIER MILLINER WORKS ON RECEIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a skill he still is trying to acquire, and his playing time this season 
probably depends on it. James Milliner rushed for an average of 10.2 yards and 
scored 33 touchdowns as a high school senior in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) I never caught a pass," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It showed last season and he is working to get better as a receiver. With an 
increased emphasis on throwing to backs this season, he has to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm jumping into passing situations when I can," Milliner said. "The thing I 
have to do is try not to think about it. When I drop a ball, it's mental. I'm 
thinking about running with it instead of about catching it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to work to make it natural." 
</P>
<P>
 Milliner is up to 225 pounds after starting at fullback at 205 last season as 
a redshirt freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 He shares time with Daron Washington, a converted tailback who still spends 
some time at that position. Washington is pushing for the No. 1 fullback job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He probably catches the ball better than I do," said Milliner, knowing that 
he has to change that to keep his spot in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Milliner caught passes for 13 and six yards from Wayne Cook in Saturday's 
scrimmage and, perhaps more important, did not drop any. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Put assistant coach Wayne Nunnely at the head of the line of those who will be 
happy to see the end of twice-daily practice sessions on Wednesday. That's 
because he has had two more weeks of them than the rest of the UCLA players and 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunnely spent those two weeks in what he calls "an internship," working with 
the defensive line at the New Orleans Saints' training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Sharmon Shah, still wearing a red jersey marking him as injured, is 
back running plays with the offense. . . . Sophomore defensive lineman Travis 
Kirschke has gained about 20 pounds, to 275, and although his primary position 
is still nose guard, he is also spending time at both tackle positions. . . . 
Biggest of the defensive linemen: Sale Isaia, at 315 pounds, five more than the 
biggest offensive lineman, tackle Jonathan Ogden. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior punter Darren Schager has a protege in junior college product Justin 
Sogoian of Orange Coast. The plan is to redshirt Sogoian. . . . It's 
anticipated that 8,000 Tennessee fans will be at the Rose Bowl for the season 
opener against UCLA on Sept. 3. . . . The Bruins plan one more scrimmage, on 
Thursday at Spaulding Field on campus. Saturday's 5 p.m. Rose Bowl workout will 
be open to the public. JIM HODGES

BULLFROGS, BLADES START PLAYOFF SERIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs will play host to a Roller Hockey International playoff game 
when their rivals, the Blades, visit The Pond tonight for Game 1 of the Pacific 
Division finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams split their regular-season series, 2-2, but the Blades have taken 
the edge recently.Los Angeles won the last two meetings and finished first in 
the division. The Bullfrogs finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we know who the real best team in the league is," said Blades Coach Bobby 
Hull Jr. after Los Angeles beat the defending RHI champions July 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Blade goalie Max Mikhailovsky has led the way, making 97 saves in a 7-4 
victory, July 23, and an 8-5 victory, Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some bad blood between the teams and some things have been said," 
Bullfrog Coach Grant Sonier said. "But they can throw whatever they want at us; 
we'll be ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
 After winning only one of their last six regular-season games, the Bullfrogs 
have come on strong in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Gervais has five goals and three assists to lead an offense that has 
converted on eight of 10 power plays. On defense, goalie Rob Laurie has been 
sharp, stopping 77 of 88 shots in the Bullfrogs two first-round victories over 
San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 2 of the Pacific Division finals is Wednesday at the Forum. If the teams 
split the two games, a 12-minute mini-game will follow the second game to 
determine which team will advance to the Western Conference finals. MICHAEL

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; MEOLA HEADED TOWARD PRACTICE SQUAD 
</P>

By Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Meola, the World Cup soccer goaltender who is trying to make the New York 
Jets as a kickoff specialist, appears headed to the practice squad. Coach Pete 
Carroll indicated Monday that Meola probably won't make the 53-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's only four or five yards from kicking the ball into the end zone, but I 
don't know if he's going to get it done in time," Carroll said. "He may get it 
done a month from now. We're still going to keep our eye on him. We'd like to 
watch and see how he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Meola has attempted five kickoffs in two preseason games, but only one has 
reached the end zone. In the Giant game last Saturday, he got off a low kick 
that was returned 56 yards by Dave Meggett. The hang time on the kick was 3.5 
seconds, and "that's not good enough," Carroll said. The ideal hang time is 3.9 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Meola said he is happy with his improvement, but sounded resigned to the 
likelihood of being released. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came in, I didn't expect to make the roster this year," he said. "My 
hope was to be part of the practice squad all year. Anything after that would 
be a bonus for me."

 Unsure of landing Deion Sanders, the San Francisco 49ers signed free agent 
cornerback Toi Cook. Cook, who spent his first seven NFL seasons in New 
Orleans, took part in his first practice with the 49ers after signing a 
one-year contract for $162,000, the veteran minimum. However, the pact includes 
incentives that could boost his compensation to $1 million, depending on 
playing time, performance and overall team success.

10 MAJOR NEW WEAPONS SYSTEMS PUT ON HIT LIST; DEFENSE: SERVICES ARE TOLD TO 
PREPARE FOR POSSIBLE DELAY OR CUTBACKS IN THE PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF BUDGET 
RESTRICTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten major weapons programs, including the Air Force's proposed new F-22 jet 
fighter, have been targeted for possible delay or cutbacks as the result of 
worsening budget problems, the Pentagon said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense officials said it has become apparent that the military may not be 
able to meet its budget limits under current requirements and that the 
individual services have been directed to prepare for possible retrenchment, 
including cancellation, of some programs now on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memorandum made public Monday, Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch 
cited the need to cover a 2.5% pay increase voted by Congress this year and to 
help finance improvements in military readiness and "other areas." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-page memo asks the services to submit proposals for cutting or 
delaying the 10 programs or replacing them with less-expensive alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Listed for possible cancellation are the Army's plan to develop the Comanche 
helicopter and an advanced field artillery system, and the Air Force's joint 
primary aircraft training system and a new precision-guided missile system. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeping proposal also raises the possibility of killing three other Navy 
and Marine Corps programs -- the Navy's push for a new attack submarine for the 
year 2001, and the Marine Corps' bid for the V-22 Osprey helicopter and for an 
advanced amphibious assault vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 And the military is being asked to review the possibility of delaying two 
other big-ticket programs -- the Air Force's proposed F-22 jet fighter, and the 
Navy's current program to buy new radar-evading Stealth guided-missile 
destroyers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear whether all of these reductions and cancellations 
ultimately would be made. Deutch set a deadline of Sept. 7 for the services to 
submit their new proposals. He said that final decisions would be made later 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 The new cutback orders, which apparently came as a surprise to the individual 
services, marked the most striking indication yet that the Clinton 
Administration may be unable to meet its defense budget targets for the coming 
fiscal year without making drastic reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration had insisted last year that even with the pay raise and 
other requirements, it would be able to come close to its projected 
defense-spending levels. Critics have challenged those assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 A Defense Department official said Monday that Deutch's memorandum was 
designed to alert the services early to the fact that the Pentagon will have to 
make some "very tough" decisions in next year's budget so that they can come up 
with alternative cuts, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps was uniformly 
negative. Officers warned that the services already have been stretched thin by 
previous budget cuts and that cancellation of new programs could hurt future 
readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials said that all four services are likely to mount vigorous 
campaigns to persuade Deutch and Defense Secretary William J. Perry not to go 
ahead with the proposed reductions. "This really is bad stuff," one senior 
military officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutch's memo provided no estimates on how much the military might be able to 
save if it followed the plan that he outlined. However, Steven Kosiak, analyst 
for the nonpartisan Defense Budget Project, estimated that it could save up to 
$20 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over how much the Administration is likely to fall short of being 
able to meet its defense budget targets has intensified. The Pentagon initially 
estimated that it would be $50 billion short over five years, but officials 
later revised that to $21 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Congress' watchdog agency, the General Accounting Office, estimated 
recently that the Administration could find itself as much as $150 billion 
short over five years. Other estimates have fallen somewhere in between. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, analysts point out that there is no certainty that the cuts will be 
accepted by Congress. Lawmakers already have forced the Administration to 
continue some weapons programs that it wanted to cut, such as the Seawolf 
submarine and B-2 bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 And as recently as Aug. 1, Vice President Al Gore told workers at the Textron 
Aerostructures plant in Nashville, Tenn., that the Administration would be 
committed to building the Marine Corps' proposed V-22 Osprey helicopter on 
schedule, as Clinton promised in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The delays that Deutch proposed in the Navy's guided-missile destroyer program 
would slow production of the radar-evading vessels to an average two or 2 1/2 
ships a year instead of the three vessels now being built each year.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOLLAR SLIDE CLIPS STOCKS, BOND PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A steep fall in the dollar sent bond yields soaring and dragged stock and bond 
prices lower Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil prices also dropped on signs that a strike by Nigerian oil workers might 
be unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar edged back toward its record low against the Japanese yen as 
dealers grew pessimistic about the outlook for progress in U.S.-Japan trade 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Market participants said American investment funds and Japanese exporters were 
heavy sellers of the U.S. currency, further depressing a dollar market glutted 
by persistent trade deficits and the movement of long-term capital out of U.S. 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican peso strengthened against the dollar on the apparent election 
victory of Ernesto Zedillo, presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party. It cost 3.338 pesos to buy a dollar in New York on Monday, 
compared to 3.359 on Friday. Zedillo's victory also sent Mexican stocks 
soaring, with the Bolsa index rising 50.79 points, or 1.88%, to close at 
2,758.97. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term U.S. Treasury bond yields rose, pushing prices down for a fourth 
consecutive session as the tumbling dollar threatened to sap foreign demand for 
bonds and other U.S. government securities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decline in bonds was exaggerated by light trading volume, with many 
investors and traders vacationing ahead of Labor Day. In thin activity, even 
relatively few bond sales can have a disproportionate impact on prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The key 30-year bond yield rose to 7.55% from 7.48% on Friday, while its 
price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 13/16 of a point, or 
$8.13 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with a lack of news or fresh economic data, the bond market's few 
participants focused on the dollar, which began to weaken in Asia and continued 
to drop when trading shifted to European and U.S. markets. It closed in New 
York at 97.83 Japanese yen, down from 98.65 on Friday and near its all-time New 
York low of 97.50 yen July 12. The greenback also closed at 1.527 German marks, 
down from 1.539 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Persistent weakness in the dollar has discouraged overseas investments in 
Treasury bonds, since U.S. securities become worth less when converted into 
foreign currencies that are worth more against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the retreating dollar and surging long-term bond interest rates 
scared off buyers in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.89 points to 3,751.22 as 235.88 
million shares changed hands, down from 279.65 million on Friday. In the 
broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the stock market is trying to digest the problems in the dollar 
and bond markets," said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Kemper 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower stock prices abroad also hurt the U.S. market. In Tokyo, the 225-share 
Nikkei index ended down 118.12 points at 20,394.58. In Frankfurt, the 30-share 
DAX average fell 25.78 points to close at 2,123.79. And in London, the 
Financial Times 100-share average closed down 20.1 points at 3,171.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Novell fell 1 1/8 to 14. The company said late Friday that it expects fiscal 
third-quarter earnings to be as much as 20% below analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Neutrogena rose 6 1/64 to 34 49/64. Johnson & Johnson will buy Neutrogena, 
maker of skin and hair care products, for $924.1 million, or $35.25 a share. 
Johnson & Johnson rose 1/8 to 49 1/8 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telefonos de Mexico ADRs rose 1 to 66 1/2, Grupo Televisa rose 1 7/8 to 61 
1/4 and Grupo Casa Autrey rose 2 1/4 to 34. 
</P>
<P>
 * Williams Cos., which agreed to sell its WilTel network services business to 
LDDS Communications for $2.5 billion, ended unchanged at 31 1/4. LDDS fell 3/4 
to 23 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the expiring contract for September delivery of light, sweet crude 
oil plunged 71 cents on the New York Merc to $16.87 a barrel, the lowest 
settlement for a near-term contract since May 4.

 Continental Bank Holders to Get 'Bonus': BankAmerica Corp., which agreed to 
buy Chicago-based Continental Bank Corp. in January for about $1.9 billion in 
stock and cash, said each share of Continental will be exchanged for either 
0.7993 share of BofA stock or $38.297 in cash. The formula used to determine 
the exchange rates was spelled out in the original purchase agreement and 
reflected the average closing price for BofA's shares in the 10 trading days 
that ended Aug. 19. The conversion rates translate into a modest bonus for 
Continental's shareholders, because the value of BofA's stock has risen 
slightly since the deal was announced and thus increased the value of the 
transaction to about $1.98 billion.

HIGH-TECH TEMPS HAVE MORE POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your recent Valley Business report (July 26) on the emergence of temporary 
workers as a permanent fixture in the labor force, though generally accurate, 
totally misrepresented a specific segment of the industry, technical temps. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been a technical temporary personnel provider for 15 years. For over 50 
years, our company has staffed industry with highly trained, skilled workers 
who command top compensation for their services. The story's most glaring error 
was its contention that technical positions could (pay) "as high as $20 per 
hour." Actually, that is closer to the average rather than the high rate, which 
ranges from $50-$60 per hour at high-tech companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Also erroneous was the statement that higher salaried temps "typically have 
little job security, rarely receive health insurance, get little or no paid 
vacation, and are often paid less . . . " Many technical temps earn higher 
wages than their full-time counterparts and may receive holiday and vacation 
pay, health insurance and participate in a retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding job security, a recent survey of our company's workers showed the 
average assignment is six months, with 33% working continuously for over one 
year, and 15% for more than two years. The survey also showed the growth in 
temporary positions is not contrary to the desires of workers. Technical temps 
deliberately opt for such a career for a variety of reasons, including: wanting 
to travel, earn more money, be their own boss, improve their skills, avoid 
office politics, and a preference for flexible work time and professional 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from being a destabilizing force, temporary workers are helping American 
companies become more productive and competitive by stabilizing labor costs. 
Arguing the merits of this emerging fact of economic life is as irrelevant 
today as were the debates over developing the internal combustion engine to 
replace horse and buggies, or the pros and cons of automation, in their 
respective eras. In a free market system, evolution happens.

 HOT CALLS: Don't tell Kathy Kifaya it's been hot. She knows it from all the 
people crowding her office. Kifaya runs the county's energy crisis intervention 
program, which helps about 3,500 people each year who can't pay their utility 
bills. This month, more than double the usual number are keeping their 
appointments to seek help. . . . Says Kifaya: "It's a burden for families on a

 FUN TOMORROWS: Suzanne Seibold didn't sleep at all Sunday night. "It's hard to 
sleep when you have to get up at 3 a.m. to appear on national television," she 
says. Seibold and three of her co-workers from Fidelity National Title Co. in 
Irvine appeared on NBC's "Today" on Monday to talk about their recent good 
fortune -- each will get more than $85,000 the next 20 years for hitting the 
California lottery on a shared ticket. Right after that it was the "Mark and 
Brian" show on KLOS-FM radio. . . . What's next? "We're hoping for Oprah 
Winfrey," she says smiling. "This has really been a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 THEY'RE HERE! "Holy Traders," picture cards of Catholic figures, are hot off 
the press and available through Catholic publications. The set of 40 trading 
cards includes Americans like Mother Cabrini. . . . The best known? Father 
Junipero Serra, "Apostle of California" and founder of Mission San Juan 
Capistrano in 1776. Among Serra's accomplishments listed on the card: 
"Introduced cattle, sheep, grains and fruit to California from Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 PUTTING ON THE POUNDS: If you put any cans in those food bins at your office, 
you should be pleased to hear the totals: The county's Food Distribution Center 
says the recent food drive among 50 local companies brought in 70,000 pounds of 
food. Cindy Cross of the center says that's enough to feed 150,000 meals to 
needy people in Orange County. . . . Biggest contributor based on pounds per 
employee: Aerochem Inc. of Orange -- 21 pounds per worker.

 Vice President Al Gore was sent home from the hospital Monday but will have to 
wear a splint or a cast for six months while he recovers from injuring his left 
Achilles' tendon while playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, 46, underwent surgery Saturday night to fuse the Achilles' tendon, which 
joins the muscles of the calf to the bone of the heel.Aides said he was in good 
spirits and planned to keep his full schedule.

MAURY FOLADARE; VETERAN PUBLICIST TO STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maury Foladare, veteran Hollywood publicist for such legends as Bing Crosby 
and Danny Thomas, has died. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
 He died Saturday night at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Beloved by news media as well as entertainers, Foladare was known as one 
Hollywood source who could be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never wrote a phony story in my life," he told The Times a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Foladare met Crosby in 1930 when the singer was with the Rhythm Boys at the 
Cocoanut Grove, and worked for him until Crosby's death in 1977. Foladare 
continued publicizing the annual Bing Crosby Golf Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby "was a very nice man, but he didn't like publicity," Foladare once 
recalled. "Often, I'd set up an interview and then I'd find out Bing had gone 
out the back way and left us there." 
</P>
<P>
 Foladare especially prized his more than four decades working for Thomas and 
his St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. When Thomas turned to producing 
television shows, Foladare was the publicist for such hits as "The Andy 
Griffith Show," "The Dick Van Dyke Show" and "Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C." 
</P>
<P>
 Other clients over the years included Gary Cooper, Mario Lanza, Louis 
Armstrong, Ozzie and Harriet Nelson, Morton Downey and Les Brown and His Band 
of Renown, as well as film studios. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Los Angeles, Foladare attended USC and worked briefly for the 
now-defunct Los Angeles Examiner. Seeking higher pay, he signed on as publicist 
for a group of theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 From that, Foladare landed the job of publicity director for the old Paramount 
Theater at 6th Street and Wilshire Boulevard in Downtown Los Angeles. His job 
included booking vaudeville acts to accompany films, and introduced him to 
several performers who became clients. At the peak of his career, Foladare 
oversaw a staff of 15 publicists in his Hollywood office. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his efforts misfired. To publicize the 1933 film "King Kong," he sent 
a man in an ape costume into a department store. One woman fainted and sued 
Foladare for $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Foladare founded the Masonic Press Club and served as its president. He also 
was on the board of Los Angeles County's Department of Adoptions for many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, Betty; his son and daughter, Robert and Maureen; 
four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

REP. REYNOLDS FREED WITHOUT BAIL ON RAPE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Mel Reynolds (D-Ill.) turned himself in Monday to face statutory rape and 
other charges, and was freed by a judge without having to post a cash bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, a first-term Democratic congressman, said he is not guilty of the 
charges contained in a 20-count indictment that alleges he had an affair with a 
16-year-old campaign worker two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds was told not to travel outside the United States or have any contact 
with his accuser, who is now 18. Reynolds will enter his plea at a hearing 
scheduled for Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I categorically deny all these charges, and I would hope that all fair-minded 
Americans would allow me to have a fair trial and allow the system to work in 
the manner in which it's supposed to work," Reynolds, 42, told reporters after 
his court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the rape charge, which carries a minimum four-year prison sentence, 
the Cook County grand jury also charged Reynolds with soliciting pornography 
from the young woman and obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, Reynolds asked the girl to provide him with a nude 
photograph of a 15-year-old friend, amid suggestions that the three would 
engage in a sexual threesome. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who is married, has denied having sexual intercourse with the girl, 
whom he has called a "liar" and a "nut case." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who is black, has decried the charges, particularly the allegations 
of pornography, saying they were the product of a publicity-seeking local 
prosecutor and a racist justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds also is reportedly facing separate investigations into his handling 
of campaign finances in 1992. Marc Kurstin, the manager of a currency exchange 
here, confirmed published accounts that the Reynolds campaign cashed thousands 
of dollars worth of checks in small amounts from individual contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds has heatedly denied those charges also in interviews with local 
newspapers.

SCOTT HARRIS: 1 OUT, BUT THERE'S STILL JOY IN QUAKEVILLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There were two outs in the final inning. The bases were loaded, and the score 
was 4-2. The pitcher seemed to be tiring, and now the dangerous cleanup hitter 
was stepping up to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time up, he struck out swinging. The next time up, he drilled a shot 
back up the middle, but the pitcher snagged it. What should have been a clean 
single to center became an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
 The third time, the saying goes, is the charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer Gordon gave a mighty swing. But this time, the ball dribbled slowly 
down the first base line. Gordon sprinted to first, but the throw beat him, and 
that was that. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklyn Center, Minn., had upset Northridge 4-2 in the first round of the 
Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa.  
</P>
<P>
 And Spencer Gordon, age 12, figured it was all his fault. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't mother him," people told Bonnie Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 This, she told me over the phone, was the advice that people around her 
offered when she called out from the stands to her boy. 
</P>
<P>
 What she called out was: "Spence, you OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 Spence was not OK. He was taking it hard. And so was his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only a game, they say. But really, it's not. It's hopes and dreams 
crystallized into moments. Bonnie Gordon, who has a law practice with her 
husband, Eric, may be able to keep her cool when negotiating megabuck business 
deals, but she has a hard time handling the pressure of Little League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a disaster," she said. "My stomach hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 After watching their boys compile a 16-0 record in the playoffs, by Monday the 
Northridge parents were as unaccustomed to defeat as the team. And Bonnie 
Gordon was more accustomed to Spencer's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many times," Bonnie explained, "Spencer has come through and been the 
champion." Not this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't mother him, people said. And Bonnie held back. But it was Spencer who 
came to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He held me so tight. He was sad. He felt like he had let everyone down." 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Eric, tried to buck him up, borrowing a familiar line from the 
movie "A League of Their Own." 
</P>
<P>
 " 'There's no crying in baseball.' That's the line Eric gave to Spencer. . . . 
Well, they're 12. It's OK to cry in baseball. . . . I think there's a lot more 
to be learned in losing." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't mother him, people said. And Bonnie found herself acting like a coach, 
giving a pep talk.. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him it's a team sport. Everyone played this game. Everyone had their 
chance," she recalled. "I told him we're going to kick butt tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 It must have encouraged Spencer to know that the loss doesn't eliminate 
Northridge from the series. It's a setback, but the boys of Quakeville could 
still win it all. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time her talk with Spencer was over, Bonnie said, the Northridge 
cleanup hitter had managed to grin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There has always been crying in baseball, especially Little League. My 
memories of the game are 98% sweet. That other 2% includes the screaming father 
who came out of the stands, entered our team's dugout and gave his son a 
spanking. A hard spanking. Why? Dad was angry because Junior had foolishly 
tried to stretch a triple into a home run and was thrown out at the plate. We 
were 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Gordon assured me you won't find any parents like that with the 
Northridge team. To those who would venture that Little League puts too much 
pressure on mere boys, she pointed out that pressure is a fact of life. "After 
what they've been through with the earthquake, to say this is pressure? Aw, 
this isn't pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge boys, she said proudly, have proven themselves winners off the 
field. In one game after another, she said, parents from rival teams have 
complimented Northridge parents on the sportsmanship of their boys. A 
Williamsport waitress, she said, remarked how they were much nicer than the 
Long Beach heck-raisers who won the World Series the last two years -- and won 
a reputation for yanking fire alarms and filching golf carts. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to suggest that everything is peachy at this World Series. There 
is, it seems, a bit of bad blood brewing over some encounters between the 
parents of the Middleboro, Mass., team and Northridge parents. But, Bonnie 
assured me, Middleboro started it. 
</P>
<P>
 It just so happens that Northridge and Middleboro square off in today's second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gonna kill 'em," Bonnie said. 
</P>

CHILD'S HAVEN AWAY FROM HOME OPENS IN CAMARILLO; FOSTER CARE: CASA PACIFICA'S 
MUCH-HERALDED AND LONG-AWAITED EMERGENCY PROGRAM ACCEPTS ITS FIRST VICTIMS OF 
ABUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hoisting plastic sacks and duffel bags full of their clothes, the two boys and 
their younger sister filed quietly out of the waiting room of the Casa Pacifica 
home for abused children and into the center's sun-drenched courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "How long are we going to be here?" one of the boys asked Casa Pacifica 
Program Manager Frank Ferratta. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I didn't know," Ferrattasaid. "I don't think they quite 
understand what this place is." 
</P>
<P>
 The three children, all under 12, were recently taken from their parents' home 
after authorities learned the youths had been physically abused. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, they became the first youngsters accepted into Casa Pacifica's 
much-heralded and long-awaited program for emergency foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's opening marked the last step in the completion of the 
$10-million, 22-acre center in Camarillo that brings together under one roof 
nurses, physicians, therapists and social workers to serve foster-care 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Pacifica opened its doors in June after nine years of planning and 
fund-raising by many of Ventura County's elected officials and wealthiest 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 A partnership between the county and a private nonprofit group, Casa Pacifica 
houses two types of foster care children: those just entering the system and 
those who have been in it for an extended period. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Casa Pacifica launched its long-term residential program for 
children who have been in foster care for years, often bouncing from one home 
to another. The 13 youths in this program, which includes some who are severely 
emotionally disturbed, will live at Casa Pacifica for up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency foster-care program, which opened Monday, is designed 
specifically to take children immediately after they are removed from their 
homes because of physical abuse or neglect.  
</P>
<P>
 These youngsters will stay at Casa Pacifica for up to 90 days and usually not 
longer than one month, or no longer than it takes county social workers to find 
appropriate new homes for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 One advantage of putting all such children at one center is to keep brothers 
and sisters together. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, authorities would probably have had to separate the three 
youngsters who came Monday, because it is rare to find a private foster-care 
home with available beds, Casa Pacifica spokeswoman Tanya Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Casa Pacifica has plenty of room: 24 beds for the long-term residential 
program and 50 for emergency foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's three newcomers, however, seemed less interested in togetherness than 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they were the first in the program, they had their choice of beds. The 
older boy chose to take a room in a cottage for older children, while the 
younger ones decided they wanted their own rooms. Each room has two single 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
 After getting over their initial fears, it took the children only about 20 
minutes to throw themselves into playing with the rows of donated games and 
toys that fill Casa Pacifica's airy, carpeted playrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While at Casa Pacifica, the children will undergo examinations by staff 
therapists and physicians to determine the extent of physical and psychological 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of those exams will help county social workers decide what type of 
long-term foster-care home would best suit the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides administering the physical and psychological tests, Casa Pacifica 
staff members have another goal for the children during their short stay in 
emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is to build them up and strengthen their 
self-esteem," child-care counselor Kim Giles said. "We're just going to let 
them be kids."

WOMAN FACES POSSIBILITY OF 'THREE STRIKES' LAW; COURTS: ANGELA ALFARO OF 
OXNARD, CONVICTED FOR HER ROLE IN A 1980 GANG RAPE, COULD BECOME FIRST FEMALE 
IN COUNTY CHARGED UNDER STATUTE. 
</P>

<P>
 An Oxnard woman convicted of taking part in a brutal gang rape 14 years ago 
may now become the first female in Ventura County to be charged under the 
state's "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Alfaro, 35, became a potential candidate for the tough sentencing 
statute after being charged with possessing a quarter gram of cocaine when she 
was stopped for speeding Aug. 3 in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Ventura County Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III ordered Alfaro, 
also known as Angela Bernard, to stand trial on the drug charge after Port 
Hueneme Police Officer Christina Alvarez testified that she found the cocaine 
in the pants pocket of Alfaro's 18-year-old nephew. Alvarez said she searched 
the suspects after she could find no driving record under Alfaro's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez said Alfaro told her on the way to the Port Hueneme Police Station 
that the cocaine belonged to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me she handed it to him prior to making the stop," Alvarez 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Brian Rafaelson said prosecutors will decide whether to 
pursue a three-strikes case against Alfaro by Sept. 13, when she is scheduled 
to be arraigned in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 A major factor in the decision, he said, will be Alfaro's 13 felony 
convictions in connection with the 1980 gang rape of a woman in Oxnard.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll consider the seriousness of the prior acts and make a decision," 
Rafaelson said. "I think she's probably going to be charged." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alfaro served six years of a 10-year, eight-month prison sentence for the 
rape. That case marked the first time a woman in Ventura County was 
successfully prosecuted for a rape. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-strikes law, which took effect March 8, requires a sentence of 25 
years to life for anyone with at least two prior serious or violent felonies 
who commits another felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Tim Quinn said outside of court Monday that Alfaro should not 
be charged with the three-strikes law because she does not fit the profile of a 
habitual criminal for whom the law was intended. 
</P>
<P>
 "She hasn't been in any significant trouble in 14 years," he said. "Three 
strikes has been publicized as a way to get repeat violent offenders off the 
streets for life. She doesn't fall into that category." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Janes would not discuss Alfaro's pending drug charge. 
But he said she deserved a stiffer sentence than she received in the gang rape. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was absolutely unconscionable what happened to the victim in that case," 
said Janes, who prosecuted Alfaro and four male defendants. "Just looking at 
the evidence back then, she's not somebody that ought to be in society." 
</P>
<P>
 During that trial, prosecutors successfully argued that Alfaro helped plan the 
assault and invited the victim to a small party where she was tied up and 
attacked repeatedly by the men, Janes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Janes said the four men prosecuted in the rape were all members of a local 
biker gang and the victim was an acquaintance of Alfaro's. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfaro is being held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her bail initially was set at $5,000, but was raised after she fled the 
Ventura County Courthouse Aug. 12 upon learning that she was a potential 
candidate for the three-strikes law and could face life in prison. She was 
later rearrested by sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "She left because she became aware she might get life," Quinn said. 
"Apparently, she didn't have as much faith in the jury system as others."

POLICE ACTIONS IN RAMPAGE JUSTIFIED, SAYS D.A.'S REPORT; CRIME: FINDINGS 
CONCLUDE THAT OXNARD OFFICERS HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO FIRE REPEATEDLY AT ALAN 
WINTERBOURNE AFTER HE HAD KILLED FOUR PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard police officers who fatally wounded Alan Winterbourne outside a 
Ventura unemployment office last December had no choice but to shoot him 
repeatedly to end his murderous rampage, county prosecutors have found. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Holmes concluded that the officers were 
justified when they shot the heavily armed Winterbourne, who had already killed 
three people at an Oxnard unemployment office and a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the arsenal Winterbourne possessed . . . it takes little imagination to 
determine how easily Winterbourne could have added to the appalling toll he had 
already exacted," Holmes wrote. "Any officer who did not use deadly force to 
prevent Alan Winterbourne from entering a second (unemployment) office that 
morning would have been derelict in performing his most fundamental duty -- 
protection of the citizenry." 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes reported that Winterbourne had unsuccessfully applied to the sheriff 
for a concealed weapons permit, that he had been seriously wounded in the chest 
at the Oxnard unemployment office near the beginning of his 13-minute rampage, 
and that he was breathing blood long before he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The report noted that the bullet that killed Oxnard Police Officer James 
O'Brien had first struck a headlight before ricocheting into his head. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Winterbourne, a 33-year-old computer engineer, had been unemployed for seven 
years before he snapped without warning last Dec. 2, drove to the Oxnard 
unemployment office and indiscriminately began shooting employees and their 
jobless clients. 
</P>
<P>
 He discarded a shotgun and fired a Smith & Wesson .44 magnum revolver before 
being wounded by police, who recognized him as the suspect because he matched a 
911 description of being white, long-haired, mustachioed and bearded, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
 In an exchange of gunfire, two shots hit Winterbourne in the chest and 
shoulder, but he gave no indication of being wounded and the police did not 
notice, Holmes reported. A mixture of blood and saliva was later found inside 
Winterbourne's car, indicating that he was breathing blood after the 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Winterbourne fled the parking lot in a tan sedan and a trail of police 
officers chased him toward Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 At the intersection of Victoria Avenue and Olivas Park Road, Winterbourne 
stopped his car, posted himself behind the driver's side door, and fired at 
least two shots at police with a Browning .300-caliber rifle with a scope. One 
struck the spotlight of a police car and deflected into O'Brien, Holmes wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ventura unemployment office, Winterbourne was felled by a fusillade of 
gunfire from Oxnard officers as he left his car with a Ruger mini-14 
.223-caliber rifle and moved toward the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "The urgency felt by the officers was such that the officer in the lead car 
fired the shots through his front window of his police unit at Winterbourne," 
Holmes wrote. Officers kicked the rifle away from Winterbourne and handcuffed 
him. The entire rampage lasted just 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A search of his car found 80 rounds of ammunition for the .223-caliber rifle, 
the .300-caliber rifle and 14 rounds of ammunition, and the .44 caliber handgun 
and 48 hollow-point rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy by the Ventura County coroner found that Winterbourne had been shot 
11 times and died of multiple gunshot wounds to the head, chest, neck, 
shoulder, arm, leg and foot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Irma Lopez, who was seriously wounded at the Oxnard unemployment office, said 
Monday she agreed that police had to use lethal force to stop the crazed 
Winterbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they hadn't shot him, he would have gone in there and shot someone," Lopez 
said. "And after he shot that officer, they weren't asking any questions." 
</P>
<P>
 A top Oxnard police officer said he hopes the district attorney's findings 
will put the incident in the past.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the conclusion of a very tragic incident," Assistant Police Chief Tom 
Cady said. "On behalf of the families and everyone involved in that incident, 
we're really glad to close this chapter -- not that it will ever be closed 
completely."

CANYON DUMP BALLOT MEASURE DEBATED AT TRIAL; COURTS: FOES, SUPPORTERS OF 
WESTERN COUNTY LANDFILL TRADE LEGAL BARBS AT DAYLONG SESSION ATTENDED BY NINE 
LAWYERS.

<P>
 The future of waste disposal in western Ventura County went on trial Monday as 
lawyers debated the legality of a ballot measure that would allow a landfill at 
Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of legal arguments, a retired appeals judge promised to rule in 
the next few days on whether the initiative is legally drafted and can remain 
on the Nov. 8 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Landfill foes argued that the ballot measure is essentially "power grabbing" 
by a private firm intent on trashing the county's land-use laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't adopt a plan first and then change all the laws," argued Katherine 
Stone, an attorney speaking for the cities of Ojai and Ventura. The cities 
closest to the canyon filed suit in July after the measure was added to the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But landfill supporters said their opponents are merely quibbling over legal 
technicalities to block the public's will. More than 32,000 county residents 
signed petitions this spring to put the measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the voters clearly understand that what they are doing with this 
initiative is considering whether they want a recycling center and landfill at 
Weldon," said Wes Peltzer, lawyer for a coalition pushing for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is backed by Taconic Resources, the San Diego County firm that 
has purchased the rights to develop the dump site. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's daylong session was no ordinary court hearing. There were nine 
lawyers, overflowing from the attorney's tables to the jury box. They offered 
no witnesses or testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they batted around phrases such as "zoning consistency matrix" and 
"adjudicatory action" as they quoted California Supreme Court cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of their arguments had been laid out before the hearing in voluminous 
legal documents filed with the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking we would need a landfill operation to take care of the 
paperwork," retired Appeals Judge Richard Abbe joked during the hearing. "Maybe 
we can recycle," he added cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's wry remarks at an earlier hearing were used against him when 
landfill supporters accused him of bias and tried unsuccessfully to take him 
off the case. Abbe, who lives in Santa Barbara, was picked to handle the matter 
only after five Ventura jurists were disqualified or removed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've decided it's best that I don't make any comments," Abbe said at the 
outset of Monday's hearing. Still he quizzed lawyers intently on their legal 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key issues was whether a private firm, Taconic Resources, can use 
an initiative to gain rights for a moneymaking project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose this would be a different case if Taconic were not mentioned, if 
they just wanted a solid waste landfill site and not give the franchise to your 
clients," Abbe said to Peltzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Peltzer said it would be "less honest to the voters" to hide the private 
firm's involvement. He argued that the landfill's foes had only cited one case 
in which courts barred a private firm from pursuing an initiative. And that 
involved a statewide measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban, he argued, does not extend to local initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone, who represents Ojai, disagreed. She acknowledged that there was only 
one court case addressing the matter, but added: "Not very many companies will 
do what's been done here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen an initiative where some private company comes in and says I 
get to build something on somebody else's land, and I'm the only one who gets 
to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, Taconic is asking voters to change land-use and zoning 
regulations to allow a landfill at the site. A larger firm, Waste Management 
Inc., tried for years to win approval for the project, but withdrew last summer 
when it became clear the Board of Supervisors would not support the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic's effort essentially circumvents the county and takes the matter 
straight to the voters. That is the whole point of California's initiative 
process, argued Jim Parrinello, an attorney working with Peltzer. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged the judge to adhere to the strict standards for removing a measure 
before it reaches the voters. "If there are problems with the initiative, if it 
is passed by the people, there will be ample time after the election," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foes argued that the initiative's defects are serious enough to remove the 
measure now. They say the wording of the initiative creates inconsistencies 
between the county's zoning and land-use rules. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, they say, the initiative method does not allow the county to 
impose all the requirements or mitigating factors that they had exacted from 
Waste Management a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Peltzer said the differences were minor and could be resolved after the 
election. Even with voter approval, landfill backers would need to obtain 18 
permits, a process that could take three to six years.

STUDENTS ARRIVE, 1 WAY OR ANOTHER, TO USUAL CROWDS; EDUCATION: THE COLLEGIANS, 
SOME RETURNING AND SOME FRESH FROM HIGH SCHOOL, ENDURE LONG LINES, CLOSED 
CLASSES AND LATE REGISTRATIONS.

 A high school graduate for less than three months, Brian Minkin of Camarillo 
is undaunted by the prospect of committing nearly the rest of the '90s to 
earning a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it takes me five years, I'll go for five years," the Ventura College 
freshman shrugged Monday, waiting outside the cafeteria to complete his class 
schedule. "I'm not too stressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the English major has noticed a difference in the caliber of 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more relaxed here than at high school," he says, inching closer to the 
front of the line. "There aren't a bunch of idiots here who don't want to be 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of students returned to classes Monday at Ventura County's three 
community colleges with the usual assortment of long bookstore lines, closed 
classes and late registrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, thousands of others walked onto the campuses for the first time Monday, 
eager to pursue their post-high school education and marveling at their 
newfound independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this," said Tom Karisko, an 18-year-old psychology major from 
Camarillo attending Moorpark College for the first time. "It's more grown up, 
so you have to be more responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Moorpark College on Monday, parking spaces were at a higher premium than 
most freshman English and math classes. Many students said they prowled the 
parking areas for more than 30 minutes looking to pounce on a place to park. 
</P>
<P>
 "You come late, stuff like this happens," said Pete Kahn, a 20-year-old 
engineering student from Simi Valley, who spent a half-hour searching out a 
parking space. "The first week is always like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Kahn and other students said they probably would not take advantage of the 
new VISTA bus service running almost hourly to Moorpark College from Thousand 
Oaks and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got stuff to do after school, so I need to have a car," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were still working out the kinks in the new VISTA bus schedule 
Monday morning. One of the first of 16 buses was late, in part because the 
driver was unfamiliar with the new routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm new on this route, so I'm still trying to figure it out," driver Charles 
Patterson said. "I'll get it right tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Although registration totals are not yet available, all three campuses were 
jumping with activity Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ventura College, hundreds of students crowded around the quad area, 
awaiting chances to alter their class schedules or sign up late for courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety percent of these people probably are adding or dropping a class," 
Registrar Joan Halk said, looking over the lengthy queue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the late sign-ups was Kelley Winter, a 28-year-old Ventura woman who at 
the last minute decided to switch from a health sciences curriculum to a 
liberal arts program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll set me back a little, but oh well," said Winter, who grew impatient 
standing in the long lines. "It's overcrowded, and everything's closed. If 
you're not registered four months in advance, you have to try and crash 
classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Suzannah Frisbie registered early for her classes at Ventura College. She 
spent part of Monday afternoon sitting under the sun, waiting for her next 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not intimidated," said the freshman foreign language student from 
Camarillo. "It's just like high school, except that you can smoke on campus and 
wear hats." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the bookstore at Oxnard College, Greg Stanton waited patiently with a 
group of friends in line to get inside the campus bookstore, which was packed 
with buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going, but it's going to take a lot of time," the 20-year-old 
telecommunications major said. "But amazingly enough, I got all my classes. Now 
I just need to buy my books." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Garcia said she brought a fistful of cash in hope of buying used books 
from students who had dropped out of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been holding my money all day trying to find people selling books," the 
18-year-old premed student said. "I might have to pay full price, but I hope 
not for all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard College spokeswoman Cathy Garnica said the first day of classes at the 
campus was going well. Garnica spent her afternoon serving as a bookstore 
gatekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of controlled confusion," said Garnica, allowing one student to 
enter the bookstore for each student leaving. "But the students are being real 
cooperative."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; GRADUATION A MILESTONE FOR TODDLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 40 toddlers with developmental delays received diplomas and mortarboards 
last weekend as their proud parents watched them graduate from a special 
learning program offered by the Easter Seal Society in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the children have been in the infant development program since shortly 
after birth, said program director Stephanie Levine. The commencement exercise 
marked a significant milestone in their development, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give them the best start possible," Levine said. "They have learned to 
reach their maximum potential." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization's staff offers an array of services, including physical and 
speech therapy and support groups for parents. Each infant is given an 
individual therapy program based on the child's needs, Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Therapists also work with parents, showing them how to work with their 
children on a daily basis at home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bea Swanks' son, Thomas, started in the learning program when he was just 6 
weeks old. Thomas was born with Down's syndrome, a congenital condition that 
results in diminished mental capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, now 3, received speech and physical therapy, including exercises 
designed to improve his balance and muscle coordination, Swanks said. The three 
years of twice-weekly therapy sessions have helped Thomas reach his full 
potential, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm frightened to think about what he would be like today without the 
program," said the Ventura woman. "I know we owe Easter Seal a lot, because 
they've brought out the best of his abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the children come to Easter Seal having been exposed to drugs while in 
the womb. Lisa Gallimore said she is a recovering drug addict who used 
marijuana and alcohol while pregnant with her son, Roy. 
</P>
<P>
 When Roy entered the infant program at age 2, he could barely talk and often 
just screamed for hours at a time, said Gallimore, an Oxnard resident. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 3-year-old, who graduated Saturday with the other toddlers, now is 
almost up to his age level in all developmental areas, she said. Gallimore is 
so grateful that she went to work as an Easter Seal staff member this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't take back what I did to my son," said Gallimore. "But I can give him 
his best chance at reaching his full potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Easter Seal will evaluate any child with any kind of developmental delay to 
determine if they can be helped by the program, Levine said. No referral or 
diagnosis from a doctor is necessary to receive an evaluation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children participate in the program two times a week for 90 minutes until they 
reach 3 years of age. Then they "graduate" into other special-education 
preschools and, in some cases, into mainstream schools. KAY SAILLANT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: GALLEGLY, BEILENSON CRIME-BILL BACKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's two congressmen -- Republican Elton Gallegly and Democrat 
Anthony C. Beilenson -- both voted for President Clinton's anti-crime bill that 
includes a nationwide ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly of Simi Valley said he joined only three other Republican congressmen 
from California in supporting President Clinton's crime bill on Sunday after 
Democrats agreed to stiffer penalties for some crimes and to trim $3.3 billion 
from what it would cost to implement the proposed changes in law.But the bill 
left intact the ban on assault weapons, despite fierce opposition from gun 
lobbying groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that this is a much better bill than the one we had last 
week," Gallegly said in a statement. "It's tougher on crime and doesn't spend 
nearly as much on social programs that may or may not have any impact on the 
violence and lawlessness Americans are living with every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Beilenson of Woodland Hills said that California and its local 
governments for the first time would be reimbursed for some of the costs of 
imprisoning undocumented immigrants who commit crimes, under a provision that 
is based on an amendment that he had authored. 
</P>
<P>
 "The acceptance of this provision is a significant victory for those of us who 
believe the federal government must face up to its responsibility for the costs 
of illegal aliens," Beilenson said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson represents a district that includes Thousand Oaks and portions of 
the San Fernando Valley. GREG RIPPEE

 An unidentified 35-year-old transient was shot and injured early Monday after 
pointing an unloaded handgun at an Oxnard police officer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who suffered wounds to his legs and left shoulder, was shot after a 
struggle with Officer James Flores about 1:30 a.m. in the 200 block of Roderick 
Avenue, near A Street.The man underwent surgery at St. John's Regional Medical 
Center and was listed in serious condition Monday afternoon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, 23, who has been with the Oxnard Police Department less than a year, 
was on patrol when he noticed a bicyclist who was "acting suspicious," Sgt. 
Cliff Troy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, who previously had worked at the Port Hueneme Police Department, was 
put on routine paid administrative leave while police continue their 
investigation. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; HOUSING PROJECT SITE CALLED CONTAMINATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An environmental consultant hired by opponents of a Ventura Avenue housing 
project has charged that the site is contaminated with oil field and industrial 
wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a package mailed to Ventura's mayor and other city officials last week, 
consultant Robert Cashier asserted that "the Neel property is totally 
unsuitable for residential development both now and in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 The Neel family, a longtime Ventura farming clan, owns 26 acres of land west 
of Ventura Avenue, between Stanley Avenue and Seneca Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's Service Corp., the national copy service giant, owns 22 adjoining 
acres to the south. Company officials have warned the city that they may move 
their headquarters out of Ventura if the city does not permit residential 
development on the nearby Neel property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neels are asking the council to give them permission Monday to build up to 
120 houses on their Ventura Avenue property. They say they also intend to 
construct bike paths and a small park. 
</P>
<P>
 But the small-business owners whose storefronts line the Neel and the Kinko's 
property have opposed the development, saying their new neighbors would object 
to the noise and smell of their oil-related industries.  
</P>
<P>
 The business owners hired environmental attorney Glen Reiser, who then 
contracted Cashier to deliver his opinion on the Neel site. Cashier based his 
opinions on historical data and aerial photos of the area, which show that 
lands were oil dump sites in past decades.CONSTANCE SOMMER

<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies and community leaders will team up next 
month for a new Thousand Oaks Neighborhood Watch program that asks employees of 
mobile businesses to be on the lookout for crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which was approved by the City Council earlier this year, will 
rely on cellular-phone-toting workers to call sheriff's officials if they spot 
suspicious behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing suspicious behavior will be the topic of a Sept. 14 training 
session at the East Valley Sheriff's Station for participants in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees of mobile businesses that operate routinely around Thousand Oaks are 
eligible to participate, if they have their own cellular phones or a two-way 
radio system. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials said they will schedule private training sessions for 
businesses unable to release employees to attend the 6 p.m. meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information or to sign up for training, call the Conejo Valley 
Chamber of Commerce at 499-1993 or Senior Deputy Patti Dreyer at 494-8267.

<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies were searching Monday for three men whose 
robbery attempt at a Thousand Oaks automated teller machine was thwarted when 
the intended victim turned and ran. 
</P>
<P>
 William James Sterhan, 46, of Thousand Oaks foiled the robbery when he fled 
from a gunman who had approached him at 10 p.m. Sunday at the Bank of America 
at 1440 N. Moorpark Road, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Sterhan had begun to use his ATM card at the bank when a man 
approached him and brandished a revolver. Another man also approached him while 
a third remained nearby. Sterhan then turned and ran across the parking lot to 
call deputies from the Sav-On drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects, who eluded a subsequent search, were described as males from 18 
to 25 years old, clean-shaven, weighing from 135 to 150 pounds and standing 5 
feet 6 inches to 5 feet 8 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a still-rattled Sterhan said he knew better than to try to use the 
teller machine when the parking lot was deserted except for the three men who 
were standing together a short distance from the teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Against my better judgment I went on to use (the teller machine) anyway," he 
said. "My better judgment told me to wait until somebody else arrived, and I 
didn't. That would be the lesson I learned, if there's a lesson." GREG RIPPEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; YOUTH HONORED FOR POETRY ABOUT PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks High School freshman, upset by world violence after the 
Persian Gulf War, wrote a poem when he was 11 that landed him and his family in 
Washington this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Anand Singh, 14, who wrote the four-verse poem "Peace To All," received a 
plaque in Washington from the International Society of Poets for being an 
"outstanding young poet." Anand said he wanted to write about the search for 
humanity and world peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about our world coming together and how we should learn from our 
previous mistakes," he said. "(With) all the war and fighting, I felt that it 
was our duty as Americans to bring the world closer." 
</P>
<P>
 Anand entered the poem in a National Library of Poetry contest and was soon 
notified that his entry, one of 20,000 submissions, was selected to become one 
of 8,000 semifinalists. Those poems will be pared down to a final 70 by 
October, a contest spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy first discovered poetry in his classes at Redwood Intermediate School 
in Thousand Oaks. Anand's eighth-grade teacher, Mary Jo Tennant, said she was 
thrilled, but not surprised by the success of her former student. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an excellent student and a fine young man," she said. But Tennant added 
that she has read numerous poetic works by youngsters that are worthy of the 
same recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed at how well many of them do," she said. "There's a wealth of 
youngsters out there who write poetry that is excellent. They care about where 
they live and they see what is going on in the communities around them and 
react with great insight." 
</P>
<P>
 For Anand, poetry has become a vehicle to express his hopes and fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it the easiest way to convey my feelings," he said. "I really enjoy 
reading poetry because it sends so many strong messages." 
</P>
<P>
 His poem begins "Let it be known and through the years be shown; that equality 
must never be based upon color or race." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his early success as a young poet, Anand has set his sights on more 
scientific pursuits, such as medicine or astronomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of too early to tell," he said of his career aspirations. But he 
added, poetry will always be an important hobby in his life. TRACY WILSON

 Contractors accidentally pierced a 2-inch underground gas pipe in Thousand 
Oaks on Monday morning, forcing the evacuation of about 200 residents from the 
Shadow Hills Apartments complex. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in the incident, said Sandi Wells, spokeswoman for the Ventura 
County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors installing sprinklers for a new playground at the 61-unit complex 
at 10:39 a.m. punctured a plastic gas line about 10 feet from the building it 
feeds, said Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the workers called the 911 emergency line and then the apartment 
manager, who launched an evacuation plan that residents had worked out with the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents quickly walked a safe distance away and waited on the sidewalk 
along Wilbur Road, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were out of there in five minutes," Wells said. "They were really 
prepared for anything there." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Gas Co. workers sealed the leak within an hour, and the 
residents were allowed to return about 11:45 a.m., Wells said. MACK REED

FUNERAL RITES SET FOR DECORATED SANTA ANA OFFICER FRANK STASTNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Funeral services are scheduled today for Officer Frank Stastny, a decorated, 
25-year veteran of the Santa Ana Police Department, who died at his home last 
week of an apparent heart attack, a department spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stastny was 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "He provided an excellent example of dedication and perseverance for us all to 
follow. He was just an all-around great guy, kind of quiet and unassuming but a 
really hard worker," spokesman Bob Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stastny joined the Police Department in 1969 and served as a patrol officer 
for three years before he was promoted to investigator. He later worked in 
several departments, including general investigations, juvenile investigation, 
robbery/homicide, sexual assaults and parental child abductions, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Stastny received a commendation for his work in investigating sex 
crimes; prosecutors obtained convictions in 92% of the cases he worked on, 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law enforcement community, and in particular his family and those of us 
who knew him, will miss him deeply," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services are scheduled for 10 a.m. at Holy Family Catholic Church, 566 
S. Glassell St., in Orange, Clark said.

SELF-DEFENSE RULED IN SHOOTING BY POLICE; OXNARD: NICHOLAS PARTEE, KILLED AFTER 
A HIGH-SPEED CHASE, MAY HAVE WANTED TO DIE AT THE HANDS OF OFFICERS, D.A.'S 
REPORT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard police were acting in self-defense when they shot an Oxnard man 19 
times last year after he pointed a gun at them following a high-speed chase, 
the district attorney's office concluded in a report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Partee, 35, who was killed in Camarillo last October by police 
officers after violating a domestic restraining order, had exhibited suicidal 
tendencies and may have wanted to die at the hands of police, according to the 
report by Deputy Dist. Atty. James Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will never be positively determined why Mr. Partee did what he did on the 
night he was killed, but one piece of information might help explain his 
actions," Ellison wrote. "Nicholas Partee's brother-in-law, Monty Menefee, told 
detectives that he and Mr. Partee had a discussion approximately a year before 
Mr. Partee's death, during which the two of them discussed suicide. Menefee 
told Partee that if he ever decided to kill himself, he would just pull a gun 
on police and force them to shoot him." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police officials refused to comment on the shooting due to pending 
litigation. Partee's family last month filed a $25-million federal lawsuit 
against Oxnard and the officers involved, charging that he was illegally gunned 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Partee, a construction worker, had left a residential drug rehabilitation 
program on the afternoon of Oct. 1, 1993, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 A check of Partee's parents' house found that on that same day he broke into 
the home, took a .22-caliber pistol, and left several suicide notes addressed 
to his family and friends, Ellison wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10 that night, Partee went to the Oxnard home of his estranged wife, Lisa 
Partee, and asked for the keys to their car, the report said. Lisa Partee had 
obtained a restraining order prohibiting her husband from coming within 100 
feet of the house after he had threatened her with violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After giving him the keys, Lisa Partee and her roommate called police, afraid 
that he might return. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Terry Burr spotted Partee as Partee sped out of a convenience store 
parking lot, and a high-speed chase ensued, reaching speeds of up to 80 m.p.h. 
on Pleasant Valley Road, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burr was joined by Officers Roger Sonsini, Christopher Orsini and James 
Stallings as the pursuit progressed onto the southbound Ventura Freeway, 
Ellison wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Partee then exited the freeway at Carmen Drive in Camarillo, and drove 
southbound on the northbound lane of Ventura Boulevard, spinning out of control 
as he tried to make a right turn at Oak Street, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonsini tried to end the pursuit by forcing Partee's car onto the curb with 
his vehicle and blocking its path. Sonsini ended up about two feet away from 
Partee's car. Still seated in the car, Partee reached down inside the car, 
grabbed a gun, and pointed it at the officer's head, Ellison wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Orsini struck Partee with a barrage of shots, and Partee slumped over. Moments 
later, however, Partee started to come up, and officers fired two more shots. 
Stallings then approached Partee's car, and when Partee came up again with a 
gun in his hand, officers fired five more shots, hitting him in the chest and 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Partee rose a third time, still holding the gun, and Sonsini fired another 
four shots at him before he finally stopped moving. Partee's gun had not been 
fired, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy found that Partee died of multiple gunshot wounds, and 19 bullets 
were removed from his body, Ellison wrote. Partee had a blood-alcohol level of 
.09%, the autopsy found. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that so many rounds (34) were fired by the officers does not change 
the legal analysis," Ellison wrote. "The officers stated that Mr. Partee 
continued to point his gun at them even after being shot, and, as long as he 
threatened them, they were entitled to use deadly force in their defense."

THOUSAND OAKS DENIES SUIT ALLEGATIONS OVER HOUSING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks City Council members denied allegations Monday that they ignored 
state environmental laws when approving a major Newbury Park development and 
blasted the Sierra Club for suing the city last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a frivolous lawsuit that will do nothing more than cost our citizens 
money," Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex Fiore said. "This lawsuit is absurd, 
completely absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Filed late Friday, the lawsuit alleges that a 220-house subdivision of the 
massive Dos Vientos development poses a substantial environmental threat and 
should not have been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club argues that the City Council's 1990 development agreement, in 
which the city gave developers the right to build in exchange for cash and 
land, does not permit the city to circumvent state environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the first subdivision in July after a divisive public 
hearing. Council members Fiore, Frank Schillo and Judy Lazar supported the 
project, saying the development agreement gave them no choice but to approve 
it. Councilwomen Elois Zeanah and Jaime Zukowski voted against the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said Monday he was surprised by the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure why they decided to sue the city now, and not when the agreement 
was being discussed six years ago," he said. "This really comes too late in the 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he thought when the agreement was signed that residents would be 
pleased because it cut in half the number of residences initially proposed for 
the 4,000-acre parcel north of Potrero Road. As approved, the project would 
have fewer houses per acre than in much of the rest of Newbury Park, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we did a good job with it," Schillo said. "Every time the residents 
got up at the hearing, they asked for the homes to be moved to the east, but 
nobody could tell me where east was. I guess they wanted it in New York State 
or something. Anywhere but in their back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore agreed, calling the Newbury Park residents who helped fund the suit "a 
small group of NIMBYs who, as soon as their own houses were built, decided that 
should be the end of development in Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 But Michelle Koetke, president of Residents to Preserve Newbury Park, said the 
group spearheaded a fund-raising effort that received more than $10,000 to help 
fund the suit. She said it was more than just a local effort.

UNDUE CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am sick and tired of part-time residents from the Surfside neighborhood 
demeaning Port Hueneme city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest example is Homer Willard's letter in the Aug. 9 edition of your 
paper.In his letter, Mr. Willard alleged that Dick Velthoen, Port Hueneme's 
city manager, was disrespectful when council member Dorill Wright announced he 
would not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 I attended that very same City Council meeting. The only emotion that I 
witnessed on the part of Velthoen was his obvious sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard and his fellow part-time residents and investors who own property in 
the Surfside area are opposed to the proposed recreational vehicle resort. 
Velthoen represents a handy scapegoat for their opposition to the project. They 
forget that the City Council approved the RV resort because it will raise 
$400,000 of much-needed new revenue for the city. The project will also provide 
an additional $3 million in sales to local businesses. It will also create new 
jobs.

Our Port Hueneme Police Department campaign: Pay attention to the facts, and 
you will know our City Council is not stealthily voting in anything. How 
ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months of hard work gave us close to 65% of the vote on Measure Z. Why 
was the campaign unopposed? Why did we have money to spend? The majority of the 
people want our city to remain crime-free and safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months before the election, the City Council discussed the utility tax 
and it was reported in the paper. The council went with the majority of the 
voters, which is right. I am flattered Mr. Freeman feels our committee was so 
powerful that we could appeal to the City Council after the election and have 
them bow to us and pass a utility tax. That is not how the city works. Our city 
is saved, and there are no bums here.

HAZARDING A GUESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am confused. When is a weed not a weed? 
</P>
<P>
 In the Aug. 11 issue of the Ventura section, there appeared an article 
regarding Charles Probst, who had scraped his property of so-called natural 
vegetation and was about to plant flowering trees and grass.Evidently his 
neighbors complained to the Planning Commission. According to the article, the 
previous owner of the property had made an agreement to leave the natural 
vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Probst was removing a fire hazard and attempting to make his property more 
to his liking. It is difficult to imagine why his neighbors would object to 
this when the city of Thousand Oaks will come to your property and remove 
natural vegetation that grows on your property or the curb area in front of 
your house and bill you for it if someone complains that your property is a 
fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 When a fire comes along and wipes out many of those beautiful homes, I wonder 
then if his neighbors will change their minds about having all those weeds 
growing in their back yards.

ALLOW VOTE ON LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The initiative process can be the only method by which voters move elected 
officials to action. 
</P>
<P>
 At this particular moment, the issue concerning the Weldon Canyon landfill is 
not that of the landfill itself.It is the issue of whether or not the voters of 
the county are to be allowed to vote on an issue vital to their welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 For years we have heard the fantasy proposals ranging from recycling 
everything to shipping the rubbish to someone else's back yard. To date we have 
had no reliable dates of attainability of total recycling nor any solid 
consumer cost for rail haul. 
</P>
<P>
 A solution to our rubbish problems must be effected, and since Weldon Canyon 
has been identified in the environmental document as the preferred location, at 
least let us vote.

BEILENSON DUCKS ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Aug. 13 article "Sybert Blasts Beilenson for Digging Political Dirt, Not 
Debating" highlights an ironic situation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same week that Rich Sybert was releasing his records to the public, 
Tony Beilenson was voting to block the Freedom of Information Act from applying 
to offices of the legislative branch (Congressional Accountability Act of 1994, 
HR 4822-Aug. 9).Of course, on that same day Beilenson also voted to maintain 
the exemption of Congress from public laws (which apply to everyone else), and 
he voted to exempt Congress from any health care reform bill that is passed by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 And in refusing to debate until mid-October, Beilenson has stated that 
"earlier debates would be pointless because voters won't focus on the election 
until the final weeks." But if we are so disinterested, how could Beilenson 
explain his barrage of mail -- $203,000 of taxpayers' money in the last 12 
months -- if he thinks we don't want to hear the real issues discussed?

MAVERICK'S GOOD DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently, Maverick's restaurant in Simi Valley was the subject in "Restaurant 
Review" in Ventura County Life. The review confirmed the fact that this is only 
one man's opinion, so we feel justified to give ours. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, the amount of people who frequent Maverick's is enough to give 
it a five-star rating. Customers don't go back to the same place week after 
week if the food and service is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 We could go on and on but instead of taking your reviewer's opinion or ours, 
try it yourselves. You won't come away hungry, and you will go back not only 
for the food but for the service, which will make you feel at home every time. 
</P>
<P>
 One added note: Maverick's was in the middle of the hardest hit area in Simi 
in our recent earthquake and took a real beating. However, Maverick's staff 
didn't waste time and moved outside to feed our forgotten corner of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 These are good people who wouldn't know how to serve anything but good food 
and provide excellent service.

BAND MEMBERS ARE LEARNING THE DRILL AT TRAINING CAMP; EDUCATION: IT'S HOURS OF 
GRUELING HARD WORK. BUT EVERYONE AGREES THE DISCIPLINE AND TEAMWORK IS REWARDED 
ON -- AND OFF -- THE FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Every weekday at 8 a.m., the Thousand Oaks High School squad storms the grassy 
athletic field to begin six grueling hours of preseason training. They practice 
formations, perform drills and if the mercury tops 90 degrees, tough. Because 
this is not a sport for the faint of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 This is band camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just as rigorous as being on a sports team," Thousand Oaks High band 
director Bill Hoehne said of his three-week intensive training program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are being tasked mentally and physically," he said. "The minute they 
walk in the gate at Thousand Oaks High School, I put them to work." 
</P>
<P>
 The late-summer ritual is performed by high school marching bands across 
Ventura County, who use the last weeks of August to prepare students for fall 
parades and football halftime shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's serious business," Newbury Park High School band director Tim Hoey said. 
"It's every bit as tough as football training." 
</P>
<P>
 The Newbury Park band started its training camp Monday and will practice eight 
hours a day for about two weeks. The Simi Valley High School band also started 
its two-week camp this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's probably about average for bands in the county," Hoey said. "It's 
really like a sport. I hate to downplay the artistic side, but that is part of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, when temperatures soared into the high 90s, the sweaty Thousand 
Oaks High Lancers marched around campus despite the oppressive heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our clothes were sticking to us," sophomore trombonist Laura Gantz said. "It 
was disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 A second-year member of Thousand Oaks High's color guard, 14-year-old Karey 
Williams is pumping iron in her spare time to strengthen her slender frame for 
upcoming parades and competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to lift weights to gain muscle because I'm so small," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the training is demanding on her time as well as her muscles, Karey 
said being a band member has taught her to work with others and boosted her 
self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of hard work," she said. "(But) it teaches you to work with other 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 During one of the frequent water breaks during a recent afternoon marching 
practice, sophomore Thomas Akers likened the three-week experience to military 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like boot camp," the French horn player explained. "But by the 
end of band camp you're ready for the school year." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the physical training, the camps are designed to help ease students 
back into school and orient incoming freshmen to high school. 
</P>
<P>
 In between morning marching drills and afternoon music practices, the older 
members of the Thousand Oaks band lead incoming freshmen on campus tours, 
showing them where their classes will be when school starts Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will have been here a month," Hoehne said of his freshman players, "and 
the other ninth-graders are going to be running into walls." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some of his classmates, 15-year-old Thomas as a freshman was able to 
meet students through band camp before classes started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in last year and knew 140 people and they knew five," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The older band members also serve as role models for the younger students, 
Hoehne said. "All these ninth-graders are associating with 12th-graders who are 
going to college next year," he said. "That has proven to be an asset." 
</P>
<P>
 The rigorous preseason training sessions are also an asset academically, 
Hoehne said, teaching students discipline that applies in and out of the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a valedictorian in our band every year that I've been here," 
Hoehne said of his six-year tenure at Thousand Oaks High. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of about 80 parents who contribute time for fund-raising and other 
activities to boost the Lancer band, Karey's mother, Mary Litzsinger, said the 
band program provides students with an education they sometimes do not receive 
in their academic classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a parent's perspective, it teaches them teamwork and camaraderie," she 
said. "I think it provides them with a foundation that is really necessary 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks High has one of the largest marching bands in Ventura County 
with 150 members and is considered to be among the top bands in Southern 
California -- a reputation the musicians hope to uphold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very demanding," said Megan Young, 16, who is captain of the color 
guard. "(But) even after all the practices, the feeling of performing is worth 
it."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; SUCH A DEAL, SUCH A DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Against all logic, the Board of Supervisors has signed off on a 35-year 
extension of Goldrich and Kest's lease to operate the Sunset Marina Park in 
Huntington Harbour.  
</P>
<P>
 And for this generosity, which included no taking of competitive bids even 
though the current lease agreement does not expire until 1999, the county has 
come away with some kind of deal: At the insistence of three supervisors who 
rightly had questions about the agreement, the operator now will pay $200,000 
in back rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, imagine the equivalent of that concession in the housing rental market. 
What landlord would agree to a long-term lease extension when a tenant owes 
months in back rent and has been bold enough to seek to be let out of it?  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, this renewal is being granted to a tenant who has practiced some 
questionable management in the past. Goldrich and Kest is said to have been 
running the operation well recently, but will old questions about substandard 
maintenance be revisited sometime down the road now that a long-term lease is 
freshly in place?  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County also has negotiated for itself a favorable share of all revenue 
generated by the marina, but it is hard to see just what the county has 
achieved here that it could not have realized by opening the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason the county handled this lease agreement the way it did remains a 
mystery and should be a subject for outside review. Since one of the things 
that the Orange County Grand Jury does is examine how well government is 
operating, it might want to have a look at how and why this deal was put 
together.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; HIS GRADUATION NIGHT PROVED PAINFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Freshman quarterback Oscar Casillas probably still has nightmares about his 
graduation from St. Monica High in Santa Monica on June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Casillas, who said he isn't a gang member, was leaving a graduation party in 
Venice in the early morning hours of June 7 when a group of gang members opened 
fire with an assault rifle, hitting him in the right leg. Four others were also 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know that I'd been shot for about 10-15 minutes," Casillas 
said. "I saw a rip in my jeans and five minutes later I felt my leg totally 
tense up. I tried walking and just fell to the ground. We were just in the 
wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually they came twice. They came once and two guys were hit. Everyone was 
on the ground hiding behind parked cars. I was fine." 
</P>
<P>
 But he was wounded when gang members opened fire from another car. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to my friend's truck across the street and another car came by 
and they started shooting again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casillas was treated and released from a local hospital. He still has a bullet 
in his thigh. The other wound was superficial. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said it wouldn't give me any problems and that it would be more 
dangerous to take it out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casillas pitched two innings in a high school all-star baseball game four days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first three days I couldn't really walk that well, but it was more of a 
muscle that was strained," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casillas, who had a 4.8 grade-point average in high school, is attending USC 
on a full academic scholarship and plans to play baseball for the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he passed for 1,800 yards and 22 touchdowns to lead St. Monica to an 
8-3 record last season, he was lightly recruited, receiving scholarship offers 
only from Northern Illinois and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty sure I was going to be (playing) baseball, but I knew they were 
short of quarterbacks for practice and I talked to Coach (Mike) Riley 
(offensive coordinator) and he said I'd be welcome to come out. It's going to 
take a lot of work to play at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which had the toughest-rated schedule in the nation in 1992 and the 
fourth-toughest last season, will play the most difficult schedule in the 
nation again this year, according to USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 USC will play five teams that went to bowl games last season -- Notre Dame, 
Penn State, UCLA, Arizona and California. CHRIS BAKER

DESERT PIRATE WILL HEAD FIELD OF 2-YEAR-OLDS FOR BALBOA STAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There will be an early preview of 1995's 3-year-olds on Wednesday in the 
Balboa Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Del Mar meet is run as the 2-year-olds are beginning to mature and show 
their potential. The 23 previous runnings of the Balboa Stakes have produced 
seven winners of the Del Mar Futurity, held on the meet's final day. 
</P>
<P>
 The "veteran" 2-year-old in the Balboa will be Desert Pirate, a six-time 
starter who won the Graduation Stakes at Del Mar on Aug. 3. He worked a 
half-mile Monday in 46 1/5, the fastest of 43 times at that distance for the 
day. Trained by Melvin Stute, he will be ridden by Patrick Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
 Desert Mirage, third in the Graduation Stakes, will make only his second 
start. He is trained by Jim Buss and ridden by Corey Nakatani. 
</P>
<P>

 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Hello Chicago scored a 1 1/4-length victory in the $45,000 allowance feature 
at Del Mar on Monday. The Broad Brush colt, ridden by Corey Black, was timed in 
1:34 for the mile before 10,731. He paid $7.80. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's match race produced a purse of $77,885, considerably less than the 
projected $100,000. Winner Soviet Problem earned $62,308 and Mamselle Bebette 
$15,577. . . . Swaps Stakes winner Silver Music will be sidelined for six 
months because of a bone chip in his ankle, trainer Wally Dollase said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice The Vice, who set a stakes record en route to victory in the Del Mar 
Oaks on Sunday, has now won both sprinting and routing, on both dirt and grass.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; STAGING A REVOLUTION POPULATED WITH EMPTY CHARACTERS; THE 
INHABITED WOMAN BY GIOCONDA BELLI ; TRANSLATED FROM THE SPANISH BY KATHLEEN 
MARCH; CURBSTONE PRESS $22.95, 420 PAGES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nicaragua may be one of the only places on the planet where agitprop meets 
magical realism in a lyrical embrace. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1979 Sandinista revolution, celebrated Nicaraguan poet Ernesto 
Cardinale assumed the post of Minister of Culture. Gioconda Belli, another 
writer actively involved in the revolution, was publishing poetry that was 
sensual, metaphysical and politically correct all at once. 
</P>
<P>
 She has now published a novel, translated from the Spanish by Kathleen March. 
"The Inhabited Woman," an account of a rich young woman's almost religious 
conversion to revolution, to making life better for the dispossessed of her 
tiny, unnamed Latin American country. But here the propaganda chokes the poetry 
out of the prose. 
</P>
<P>
 There are occasional flashes of poetry in "The Inhabited Woman," particularly 
in the sequences about the Indian lovers: "Where is Yarince? Has he taken 
shelter in another tree, or is he wandering the sky like a star, or has he 
become a hummingbird?" "How I hurt to my very roots . . . I don't know if it's 
raining or if it's me crying." 
</P>
<P>
 And Belli displays technical virtuosity in establishing two parallel plots 
that build with equal cinematic tension. Unfortunately, she doesn't have an ear 
for realistic dialogue, to capture a personality in its way with words. She is 
unable to populate her novel with characters that spring to life. We don't see 
them, can't hear them. "The Inhabited Woman" feels oddly under-inhabited, in 
fact, downright uninhabited. 
</P>
<P>
 Belli has a powerful story to tell. She has constructed a strong, dramatic 
framework in which to house two sets of lovers -- Itza and Yarince, Lavinia and 
Felipe, young people separated by centuries, equally fired up with zeal to 
fight oppressors, taking parallel roads to heroic yet tragic deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Itza and Yarince, Central American natives, come of age at the time of the 
invasions of the conquistadors. Itza runs off with Yarince without the blessing 
of marriage. She will not marry him, but remains his lover, a shocker for her 
time. She refuses to bear his children, fearing they would only meet horrifying 
fates as slaves. She becomes a woman warrior and with Yarince, one of the last 
resisting fighters; they are hunted down like animals by the Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The modern story, that of Lavinia and Felipe, takes place in an unnamed 
Central American country (read Nicaragua), in a small city called Faguas, on a 
lake, surrounded by lush vegetation and spooky volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
 First we meet Itza, dead for centuries, whose spirit is shooting up through 
the roots, trunk, leaves and oranges of a tree in the garden of an elegant 
colonial house belonging to Lavinia, a well-bred, beautiful young lady with 
impeccable European degrees in architecture. The spirit watches Lavinia, 
becoming increasingly critical of her seeming lack of social compassion or 
willingness to commit to the cause of "the movement" (read Sandinistas). 
</P>
<P>
 Lavinia becomes "the inhabited woman," that is, the woman possessed by the 
spirit of Itza, after she drinks a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice. Itza 
pulses along as part of Lavinia's blood, organs and arteries. Her physical 
presence in Lavinia's innards somehow allows her to become one with Lavinia's 
soul. She becomes Lavinia's conscience, determining that Lavinia's fate will 
mirror her own. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a cheap trick, though. Belli doesn't have to develop any genuine 
motivation in Lavinia. The dead Indian girl's spirit inside her plants words, 
feelings and ideas in her head. And one starts to wonder if all the other 
revolutionaries also drank glasses of orange juice and found they had 
commanding spirits inside them too. If they do, Belli isn't talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does this book feel so underpopulated? The Latin Americans I have met, for 
example, are completely thrown by the American worship of the individual, the 
Western loner. Their idea of a good time is moving in huge crowds. There, you 
date a crowd as well as an individual. Belli mentions Lavinia's rich, playful 
crowd, indifferent to the misery of those living in shanty towns and hovels 
surrounding Faguas. Yet we never feel their loud, lively presence. They are as 
ghostly as the spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Characters remain pawns in a carefully arranged plot. Each serves a purpose 
and never transcends that. Lavinia's old friend Sara never rises above 
symbolizing all of the selfish young women who marry and only think of their 
gardens, teapots and having babies. Even her husband Adrian, who flirted with 
the movement in college, finally doesn't do more than stand in when necessary. 
Flor and Sebastian, Lavinia's new revolutionary acquaintances, could be any of 
the selfless, remote, idealized revolutionaries we've met in books and film. 
They lecture, they act, but they never materialize in human form. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Felipe, Lavinia's lover and a fellow architect who meets an absurd end, 
displays character. He misbehaves, broods; he's a sexist, he's not predictable. 
He keeps the human side of the story alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Belli has engineered an exciting conclusion to her story, but it feels exactly 
that: engineered because of the leaden, prosaic language and the weak 
characters. Perhaps in her next time out in fiction Belli's poetic muse will 
inhabit her while she writes prose.

 AIR ATTACK: The skies may be friendly, but for United Airlines, the 
competition on the ground is fierce. In October, it will launch a new shuttle 
from 14 cities, including Burbank, that takes direct aim at Southwest Airlines. 
. . . Yet it might be a flight of fancy. Southwest, an expert at keeping costs 
down, earned $154 million last year, while United lost $50 million. See Valley 
Business, Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 FUNNY VALLEY: So what if Leno does his monologues in Burbank? Or if Hope just 
signed for his zillionth year with NBC? Those two are not the funniest people 
in the Valley. Not officially at least. That title will be announced in October 
at L.A. Cabaret in Encino, which is holding its 10th annual Funniest Person in 
the Valley contest on Tuesdays. . . . Contestants must do a seven-minute 
stand-up routine.

 BIG LOSS: The boys of Northridge got off to a poor start Monday on the first 
day of the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa. (C1). They managed 
only one hit and went down to defeat, 4-2, to Brooklyn Center, Minn. But the 
11- and 12-year-old all-stars are guaranteed a comeback chance in at least two 
more games. They play Middleboro, Mass., today at 10 a.m. . . . Want to watch? 
ESPN will carry the game. 
</P>
<P>
 NOW HEAR THIS: Northridge will have some support in high places at 
Williamsport this week. Merle Sanders, a Little League volunteer from Mission 
Hills, made his debut Monday as the official public address announcer. . . . 
Sanders, 63, doesn't hide his sentiments. "I want Northridge to win, 
absolutely," he says (B1).

 GETTING HELP: Gina Mirabella had the American Dream and lost it -- she went 
from being a real estate broker to being homeless. But she's back on her feet 
now and runs the emergency food pantry at MEND (Meet Each Need with Dignity) in 
Pacioma (B2). . . . "I don't think there is any shame in needing help," said 
Mirabella. Michael Arkush

FAMALARO GIVEN WEEK TO WEIGH EXTRADITION FIGHT; COURTS: ARIZONA ATTORNEY 
REPRESENTING MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING DENISE HUBER SAYS HE NEEDS MORE TIME TO 
REVIEW DOCUMENTS. LOCAL PUBLIC DEFENDER DOES NOT EXPECT HIS CLIENT TO CONTEST 
PROCEEDING. 
</P>

<P>
 Murder suspect John J. Famalaro was granted a week's reprieve Monday to decide 
whether to fight his extradition to Orange County on charges of killing Denise 
Huber and keeping her body in a freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing in Yavapai County Superior Court on a governors' warrant, Famalaro 
sat quietly, staring straight ahead during a brief court hearing in which Judge 
Raymond W. Weaver Jr. gave the defense until 5 p.m. Aug. 29 to file documents 
contesting extradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Thomas K. Kelly, who is representing Famalaro in Arizona 
matters, said outside of court that he needs more time to review the 
extradition documents signed by Govs. Pete Wilson and Fife Symington and filed 
in court here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we feel there are some legal issues there, we could contest the validity 
of the complaint or the extradition warrant," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia, who is representing Famalaro in Orange 
County, said it has been beneficial to keep Famalaro in Arizona to assist 
members of the defense team digging into Famalaro's background locally and to 
give the defense more time to prepare for the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Gumlia said, he expects Famalaro to waive extradition next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assuming (the extradition paperwork) is all in order, John Famalaro will 
waive on the 29th," Gumlia said, adding that Monday's hearing "is not a 
statement that extradition is going to be fought." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's anticipated waiver of extradition would be a token gesture of 
cooperation. Experts say extradition is inevitable unless a defendant can prove 
that he is not the suspect being sought or that law enforcement has erred in 
considering him a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro faces the death penalty if convicted of kidnaping and murdering 
Huber, a 23-year-old Newport Beach waitress who vanished in June, 1991, after a 
tire blew out on her car on the Corona del Mar Freeway as she was driving home 
from a rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona law enforcement officials last month found Huber's nude, handcuffed 
body in a running freezer stowed inside a stolen rental truck that was parked 
in Famalaro's driveway. Huber's belongings were found in Famalaro's garage in a 
box marked "Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Medical tests are pending to determine whether Huber was sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurisdiction in the case shifted from Yavapai County to Orange County after 
law enforcement authorities discovered traces of Huber's blood in a Laguna 
Hills warehouse rented by Famalaro. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities allege that Huber was abducted or lured from the side of the road 
and killed in the warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 If Famalaro waives extradition, as expected, he must be transported to Orange 
County within 10 days, said Yavapai County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman 
Laurie Berra. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said if he decided to waive extradition, Famalaro could be taken from 
Arizona as early as Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said Monday that authorities 
have not yet decided who will go to Arizona to pick up the suspect or whether 
Famalaro will be brought back to Orange County "by air, land or by sea." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're waiting until (extradition) actually happens," Conley said. "Until it 
goes down, you don't react." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, 37, has been a model prisoner during his monthlong incarceration at 
the Yavapai County Jail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Monday, Weaver agreed to dismiss a theft charge against 
Famalaro stemming from the stolen rental truck. The dismissal, which could be 
refiled if necessary, will smooth the way for extradition on the more serious 
charges, said Yavapai County Counsel Thomas B. Lindberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "All it means is the defense is trying to buy a little more time," Lindberg 
said of the extradition issue. When told of Lindberg's remarks, Kelly said the 
prosecutor was very "perceptive" but declined further comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro appeared healthy during the hearing and did not shy away from the 
media cameras. As on prior occasions, he wore an orange jail uniform as he 
shuffled into the courtroom, his ankles shackled and his wrists handcuffed and 
bound to his waist. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said his client is doing as well as can be expected, but he is concerned 
about his family. Famalaro has had several visits with his parents and sister, 
but noted that Famalaro's father, who has Parkinson's disease, was recently 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro lived next door to his parents and was their primary caretaker until 
his arrest.HUBER, DENISE ANETTE

SUIT CONTENDS MINING HURT TRABUCO CREEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney filed a lawsuit Monday claiming that a 
South County mining company has repeatedly polluted Trabuco Creek, damaging the 
stream bed and destroying sensitive natural habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit in Orange County Superior Court alleges that San Juan 
Capistrano-based Mission Viejo Materials Inc. has also refused to comply with a 
2-year-old agreement with the California Department of Fish and Game to correct 
damage to the creek, which winds from Trabuco Canyon southwest to Doheny State 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They dug into the stream bed and in some instances placed fill dirt within 
the stream bed," Deputy Dist. Atty. Valerie A. Griswold said. "But the major 
concern is about the agreement. Mission Viejo Materials forged an agreement 
with the Department of Fish and Game to rectify and remedy the impacts and they 
have failed to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Lemieux, president of Mission Viejo Materials, didn't return phone 
calls for comment Monday. Griswold said the company was sent a draft copy of 
the complaint two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The damaged area is a three-mile stretch running north from Avery Parkway 
toward Oso Parkway on Rancho Mission Viejo land in Mission Viejo. Mission Viejo 
Materials has leased property for its 600-acre mining operation from the Santa 
Margarita Co. for the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The company mines sand and gravel for use in construction, particularly for 
road building, which is especially busy now because of toll road and freeway 
widening projects underway in the South County area. 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold contends that about 150 acres, much of it along the creek, have been 
damaged by mining and "another major concern is 100 to 200 more acres which 
could be subject to their mining operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Several endangered species of birds, including the least bell's vireo, live in 
the riparian habitat along the creek, Griswold said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very concerned about the damage to the habitat," Griswold said. "Our 
state has less than 10% of its riparian habitat left. It's critical to restore 
it to its natural state." 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold said she will seek a temporary restraining order today in Superior 
Court to halt the mining operation in the damaged area. The county is seeking 
to recoup costs of its investigation and perhaps any fines "that are deemed 
appropriate," Griswold said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not seeking a listed sum (for damages) at this juncture," Griswold 
said. "The number one thing is to get the environment back in order."  
</P>
<P>
 Griswold said the problems in the creek began more than three years ago. Then, 
in September, 1992, Mission Viejo Materials reached an agreement with the state 
Department of Fish and Game to rectify the problems within a year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo Materials "then proceeded to get extension and extension from 
Fish and Game and in fact did not live up to the terms of the agreement," 
Griswold said.

TRUCK CRASH JAMS FREEWAY FOR MILES; ACCIDENT: THE HUGE VEHICLE PLOWS THROUGH A 
CONCRETE MEDIAN IN COSTA MESA. INJURIES ARE MINOR, BUT THE TRAFFIC STRETCHES TO 
LONG BEACH ON SOUTHBOUND SIDE AND DOWN TO IRVINE IN NORTHBOUND LANES.

 A tractor-trailer truck careened through a concrete median and into opposing 
traffic Monday afternoon on the San Diego Freeway, causing a 12-mile-long 
traffic jam that lasted for hours but cleared up just in time for the evening 
commute. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the truck struck two cars and four other vehicles were damaged by 
flying concrete, no one was injured except the truck driver, who suffered a 
bruised forehead and cut knee. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol is investigating the incident. So far, no one 
has been cited, CHP spokeswoman Angel Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 1 p.m. as 34-year-old Barrett Andrew Hendrix of 
San Jose was driving the 40-foot Allied Van Line truck south on the San Diego 
Freeway near Fairview Road. He was transporting machinery from San Jose to 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 As he reached under his seat to retrieve a log book that had fallen, Johnson 
said, southbound traffic ahead of him stopped. To avoid cars in front of him, 
Johnson said, Hendrix swerved into the median strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck crashed through the median and hit two vehicles traveling north 
before coming to rest perpendicular to all traffic and blocking both sides of 
the freeway, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 gallons of diesel fuel spilled onto the roadway. All lanes of the 
freeway remained closed for about an hour as Caltrans crews cleaned up the fuel 
spill, CHP Officer Kari Keul said. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2 p.m., most southbound lanes had reopened. But most northbound lanes 
remained closed until about 3:30 p.m., Keul said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, southbound traffic was backed up for nearly 12 miles, from Costa 
Mesa to the San Gabriel River Freeway in Long Beach. The northbound traffic jam 
extended for about seven miles from Fairview Road to Yale Avenue in Irvine, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident-related congestion finally thinned out about 4 p.m. -- just in 
time for rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendrix was taken to Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, 
where he was treated and released. Hendrix told CHP officers he was driving 
about 60 m.p.h. at the time of the crash, Johnson said. His big rig sustained 
"substantial" damage, she said.

CAUGHT IN THE CLASS CRUNCH; REGISTRATION A NIGHTMARE AS COLLEGE STUDENTS VIE

 Back to school doesn't always mean back to class. Just ask Kim Nguyen who is 
attending -- or trying to attend -- Cypress College.  
</P>
<P>
 "I petitioned to get into five classes," Nguyen, 17, of Garden Grove said 
Monday, the first day of class. "So far, I've shown up at two (classes) and 
couldn't get into either of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the academic age of budget-cutting, where fewer state dollars 
translate into fewer class sections for students at state colleges and 
universities. At Cypress and other community colleges around Orange County, 
students scrambled to squeak into the final prized slots in courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes began at Cypress, Fullerton, Saddleback, Irvine Valley and Rancho 
Santiago colleges Monday, a week after Orange Coast and Golden West colleges 
opened their doors for the fall semester. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all pleasantly surprised with how smoothly the first day of class 
went," said Jane Armstrong, acting president of Fullerton College. "Those 
students who got in early and took care of registration by telephone got a good 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Many classes were full at Irvine Valley College, spokesman George McCrory 
said. "Just about every parking space on campus is filled -- even those which 
aren't supposed to be spaces," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cypress College, students buzzed in the school halls and compared notes on 
which instructors were tough and which were easier. In the school's Twain 
Station snack bar, students chomped on doughnuts and hamburgers while scanning 
their new textbooks. Some spoke frantically in Vietnamese or Spanish on 
cafeteria pay telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just graduated from high school in June, and I came to Cypress because I 
heard it's bigger than other schools," Shital Patel said, tucking papers into 
her backpack. 
</P>
<P>
 Patel's academic plate will be full this fall: She enrolled in computer 
science, theater arts, psychology, counseling and English classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, I love college -- you're free to do anything," said Patel, 17, of 
Anaheim. To add to her excitement, she noted she got into her 8 a.m. English 
class after trying unsuccessfully to get into two others. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students were not so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are students fighting for classes that are open, but we have a lot of 
classes that are closed," said Larry Mercadante, vice president of student 
development services. "We just cannot offer enough English and math classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students seek basic English and math because they are prerequisites for 
other courses, Mercadante said. To alleviate the course crunch, classes in 
other subjects have been cut back and the number of English and math courses 
increased, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators have scaled back the number of courses offered to match cuts in 
their budgets, they said.  
</P>
<P>
 At Cypress, nearly $820,000 was pared from last year's budget -- leaving about 
$27 million for this school year, said Donna Hatchett, spokeswoman for the 
North Orange County Community College District. Fullerton College's budget was 
cut by more than $635,000, leaving $35 million for the upcoming school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers weren't Kim Nguyen's concern, though. She was worried about the 
numbers that glowed from a black television screen outside the Cypress College 
administration offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The screen showed course numbers that corresponded to the college's remaining 
open classes, which Nguyen compared carefully with numbers and course 
descriptions in the catalogue she clutched in her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the classes I wanted were open," Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Nguyen jotted down a few notes, fellow student Connie Mercado tried to 
encourage her. Mercado, a psychology major who also works as a receptionist in 
a hair salon, called registration a desperate process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm lucky. I signed up for three classes in advance by phone. But she tried 
to do it at walk-in registration, when there are no classes available," Mercado 
said. "But if you think this is hell, you can reach beyond the reaches of hell 
-- into the abyss -- if you try to get night classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen showed a large, blue card to Mercado; she had written the numbers of 
two dance classes on it. "Now what?" Nguyen asked.  
</P>
<P>
 Mercado put her hand on Nguyen's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just run over to the teachers who teach those classes and beg for their 
mercy," Mercado said. To get into classes after registration, students must 
obtain their teachers' approval, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 With a smile and wave of thanks, Nguyen trotted to the gym to find the 
instructors, and Mercado followed her with her gaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 24, I've got a kid and here I am getting my education," said Mercado, who 
dreams of being a psychologist. "The lines and money are worth it."

POLANSKI'S SEX ASSAULT VICTIM SEEKS LEGAL END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An attorney for the woman who was sexually assaulted as a child by film 
director Roman Polanski in 1977 said his client would like to see the criminal 
case settled once and for all -- including an arrangement under which Polanski 
could return to the United States without serving prison time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in everyone's best interest that this sorry event which occurred now 17 
years ago be put to rest and allow the parties to live their lives as normally 
as possible," attorney Lawrence Silver said.  
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, the woman and Polanski reached an out-of-court settlement of a 
civil lawsuit she filed stemming from the unlawful encounter at the otherwise 
unoccupied home of actor Jack Nicholson. Polanski fled the country in early 
1978 just before he was to be sentenced for having unlawful sexual intercourse 
with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver would not disclose either the terms of the settlement or the name of 
his client, now 30, who is identified only as "Jane Doe" in legal papers. She 
was 13 at the time of the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the woman, who at last report was living in Hawaii, had no interest in 
being interviewed. Silver added that her willingness to see the criminal case 
dropped was not a condition of the settlement of the civil case, which she 
filed in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each time the issue comes up, it raises for my client the specter of a 
re-examination of the matter," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One way to get it past her is to have all the legal entanglements (resolved), 
including Mr. Polanski's return to the United States," Silver said, "so 
frankly, she doesn't have to read about it anymore in the morning paper or hear 
about it anymore in the national news." 
</P>
<P>
 Polanski, director of "Rosemary's Baby," "Chinatown" and more recently "Bitter 
Moon," fled Los Angeles after undergoing a 42-day diagnostic study at the state 
prison in Chino. 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, in his autobiography, Polanski claimed that he left the country 
after Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Laurence J. Rittenband, who has since 
died, reneged on an arrangement that he serve no more than 90 days prison time 
at Chino. 
</P>
<P>
 Rittenband, according to lawyers in the case, said he intended to give 
Polanski, then 42, a prison term but would shorten it if the director accepted 
voluntary deportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Polanski, who continues to direct films in Europe, has sought 
several times through intermediaries to strike a deal to stay out of prison if 
he returned to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Roger J. Gunson said Monday that his office continues 
to hold firm to its position that Polanski give himself up and let a judge 
determine his fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Polanski will have to surrender to the court and let the court decide 
what should happen in the case," Gunson said. "It's the position we've had 
since the first approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunson said the last communication he had with attorneys representing Polanski 
came almost two years ago when Polanski's lawyers informally asked a judge 
whether the film director, if he returned, would be placed in custody while the 
case was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunson said that after the settlement of the civil case, he received a letter 
from Silver asking that the criminal case be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our response was that our position would remain the same," Gunson said. "That 
is, that the way that Mr. Polanski can resolve this case is by submitting to 
the jurisdiction of the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Polanski's longtime criminal attorney, Douglas Dalton, did not return phone 
calls Monday. But a spokesman for Dalton said: "A deal has not been struck for 
Mr. Polanski's return."

LEAKS, TUNNELING UNDERMINED STREET; TRANSIT: TRAFFIC REOPENS ON BUCKLED STRETCH 
OF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. SUBWAY EXCAVATION IS AT A STANDSTILL; RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR REPAIRS IS UNCLEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 Water leaks and tunneling into soft earth caused the ground above on Hollywood 
Boulevard to sink up to nine inches and prompted a halt in excavation for the 
Los Angeles Metro Rail subway project, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The famous thoroughfare was reopened to traffic Monday afternoon. But it was 
unclear how long the subway tunneling would remain at a standstill and who 
would pay to shore up the tunnels and repair the damage aboveground. 
</P>
<P>
 Life on the Walk of Fame was anything but back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is this -- from the earthquake?" Leslie David, an actress, said after a 
police officer turned her away from walking down Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Store owners also were grumbling over lost business opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's up in arms," said George Erickson, owner of "By George!" a sort 
of Frederick's of Hollywood for men. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials blamed the sinking on two 
problems: loosely packed, sandy soil and leaky water pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both problems have caused the earth to sink along a multi-block stretch of 
Hollywood Boulevard and forced subway builders to brace sections of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Miner, deputy construction manager for Parsons-Dillingham, which is 
overseeing building of the subway, said experts were still assessing the cause 
of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Some water pipes may have been ruptured by the Northridge earthquake, he said. 
"We're gathering information to find out exactly what transpired," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The subsidence was anticipated to a certain degree," said MTA spokesman Bill 
Heard. "What could not be anticipated was the saturated area." 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA has put together a "water search team" to look for all the leaks. A 
spokesman for the city Department of Water and Power said Monday that the leaks 
appear to be "coming from a number of leaks in service lines." Repairs are the 
responsibility of the water customer, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Responsibility for all these things will have to be sorted out," Heard said. 
But the MTA spokesman acknowledged that the initial subsidence was caused by 
tunneling and added, "We're not trying to dodge anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials took steps to brace the tunnels. "My impression is that the 
stabilization . . . is apparently working," said Kim Kimball, the MTA's deputy 
chief executive officer who took aides of Mayor Richard Riordan on a tour of 
the tunnel Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, workers noticed that the wooden wedges supporting the concrete 
tunnel liners were compressed, apparently squeezed from above. To shore up the 
tunnels, workers have installed horizontal and vertical steel beams. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimball said he saw some water dripping in the tunnel but added, "I didn't see 
anything I would consider abnormal water flow. That's comforting." 
</P>
<P>
 "The other part that is comforting is that we have not had any more subsidence 
at the surface level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA's response failed to satisfy Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich, who Monday called for an investigation into the subway 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 After shopkeepers on Hollywood Boulevard complained about cracks in buildings, 
work was suspended Thursday on the $1.5-billion second leg of the subway that 
eventually will connect Downtown Los Angeles to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Sections of the Walk of Fame also buckled and cracked, and celebrities' stars 
were removed over the weekend from sections of damaged sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 A multi-block section of Hollywood Boulevard was closed Saturday afternoon. 
Many stores along the closed-off stretch remained shuttered until the street 
was reopened Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials have been accepting claims from business owners seeking to 
recover repair costs or economic losses. Some owners complained that they were 
unable to get an explanation for the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows anything," grumbled Elias Khoury, owner of Georgio's Famous 
Pizza, pointing to cracks in his building. 
</P>
<P>
 Khoury said he lost $1,200 in business; the restaurant had no gas or water, 
and water damage had rippled the floor. "The whole floor is like a roller 
coaster," he said. A Sinking Street Several blocks of Hollywood Boulevard were 
reopened Monday after the earth above an unfinished Metro Rail tunnel sank-by 
as much as nine inches in one spot. Officials are still trying to determine 
what happened. * 1. Workers are digging two subway tunnels about 40 to 50 feet 
beneath Hollywood Boulevard. 2. Between the street and the tunnels is a layer 
of loosely packed, sandy soil, saturated with water. There are broken water 
lines nearby, but it is unclear when they ruptured. 3. A combination of wet, 
sandy earth and excavation apparently caused the sinkage. 4. On Thursday, 
workers noticed that the wooden support wedges in the ceiling of the north 
tunnel were compressed, apparently squeezed from above. They closed the tunnel. 
5. Over the weekend, the street began to sink noticeably, leading to its 
closure. 6. Workers are now shoring up the north tunnel with steel and wood 
bracing every four feet. Sources: MTA Researched by NICHOLAS RICCARDI / Los

BLACK LEADERS MIXED ON CHAVIS' OUSTER; CIVIL RIGHTS: SOME ARE OUTRAGED OVER 
COMMITMENT OF NAACP FUNDS TO SETTLE SEX DISCRIMINATION SUIT; OTHERS CREDIT HIM 
WITH BRINGING NEW LIFE TO ORGANIZATION. HE FILES AN ACTION CHARGING VIOLATION 
OF GROUP'S BYLAWS.

<P>
 It was the spring of 1993, and Benjamin F. Chavis Jr.'s first official act 
after taking the reins of the NAACP was to visit Los Angeles -- where the eyes 
of the nation were nervously directed, awaiting a verdict in the federal trial 
of four officers accused in the beating of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis was on a mission to broaden the base of the 85-year-old organization, 
to make it more responsive to the needs of the nation's have-nots. He did this 
in symbolic fashion by taking up residence in a housing project, encouraging 
pregnant teen-agers to stay in school and urging gang members to continue their 
truce. 
</P>
<P>
 That mission -- which captured the attention of many and brought new 
enthusiasm in the organization -- came to an end last weekend when the NAACP 
board ousted the executive director. The termination came amid a growing furor 
over his decision -- without telling the NAACP board -- to use up to $332,400 
in NAACP funds to settle a former employee's breach of contract suit that 
alleged sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis filed suit in District of Columbia Superior Court on Monday, 
maintaining that his firing violated the national organization's bylaws. He 
alleged that the board did not properly record its vote to remove him and did 
not grant him a proper hearing before his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, some still recalled the optimism of that trip last year and 
criticized the decision to cut short Chavis' tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Duff, the president of the Los Angeles chapter, was outraged by the 
decision by the national board, and he has urged the members of the Los Angeles 
chapter to respond by working to remove the national board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at a crossroads and the board went the wrong way," Duff said. "They 
robbed the association of its best chance to be in the (civil rights) 
leadership in the '90s and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 Duff said the decision to remove Chavis went far deeper than mere concern over 
the executive director's judgment in making an out-of-court settlement with 
former aide, Mary E. Stansel.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was more a rejection of his direction than it was of his judgment," Duff 
said. "It was a rejection of Chavis' outreach efforts in all areas, starting 
out with his decision to stay in the Los Angles projects, the efforts he made 
to bring Latinos into the organization and his outreach to so-called militant 
groups and leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Duff said he went to Baltimore in the hopes of changing the board's mind but 
was blocked from participating in the debate because he does not belong to the 
64-member national board. 
</P>
<P>
 The decison to remove Chavis was supported by a national board member who 
represents the Los Angeles branch. But on Sunday, members of the Los Angeles 
chapter overwhelmingly approved a resolution supporting Chavis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our members were unhappy to say the least" at Chavis' ouster, said Frank 
Berry, the branch executive for the chapter. "We had taken a position in 
support of his leadership, and we wanted to prevent this kind of fiasco from 
happening. People were sorry that the board decided to go that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many were angry with the national board's decision, few were 
surprised to see Chavis go. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should have used better judgment," said Chilton Alphonse, who directs the 
Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation, an anti-gang program. "I don't 
think that was enough to fire him, but that was the avenue they chose to get 
rid of him. He gave them the opportunity, and his board took it." 
</P>
<P>
 Alphonse said the organization was threatened by the changes Chavis was 
initiating over his 16-month tenure. Chavis should have been reprimanded 
instead, he argued.  
</P>
<P>
 "The NAACP is a very conservative organization that is not ready to change," 
said Alphonse said. "Young people were really listening to what Ben Chavis had 
to say. They were joining the NAACP." 
</P>
<P>
 But others said Monday that Chavis left the organization little choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a lifelong member of the NAACP and I certainly don't think the resources 
of the organization should be spent to settle private litigations," said 
Melanie Lomax, an attorney and former NAACP official.  
</P>
<P>
 Lomax said Chavis' effort to quietly settle the lawsuit raised even more 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assume that the reason why he was not forthright and did not go through the 
proper channels was because the charge had some merit to it," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm offended on a couple of different levels," said Renee Campbell, a 
longtime NAACP member and president of the California Assn. of Black Lawyers. 
"It is the manner in which he handled the allegations that disturbs me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many said the ouster was not just the result of the lawsuit, but involved a 
concern over the direction Chavis was taking the country's oldest civil rights 
organization -- including a move to reach out to Louis Farrakhan, the 
controversial leader of the Nation of Islam. Berry said the national board's 
decision appeared to be influenced by Chavis' increasing links with Farrakhan.  
</P>
<P>
 "Farrakhan represents a significant part of the African American community, 
and he deserves to sit at the table," Berry said. "That doesn't mean that he 
has taken over the NAACP." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis first gained national attention as an activist in the 1970s while 
protesting school segregation in North Carolina. Arrested as one of a group of 
activists called the "Wilmington 10," Chavis was convicted of arson and 
conspiracy to commit assault and sentenced to 34 years in prison. He served 
four years before the convictions were overturned by a federal appeals court.  
</P>
<P>
 For many, Chavis' message was a breath of fresh air in the stodgy National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. But some maintained that the 
direction he was taking the NAACP threatened corporate funding at a time when 
the organization is $3 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision has hurt the NAACP on the street, where many looked to Chavis as 
a voice in the traditionally mainstream organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another example that shows that the NAACP is out of touch with the 
people," said Fred Williams, a former gang member and community activist. "It 
was clear that the middle-class board members do not intend to serve the 
community."  
</P>
<P>
 During his 1993 visit to Los Angeles, Chavis stopped at a small school in Los 
Angeles for pregnant teen-agers and left a lasting impression on the students 
and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very concerned and caring person," said Mary Reynolds, the former 
principal at Riley High School in South-Central Los Angeles. "He barely had a 
chance to do anything, and now he is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis told the children that he had been an NAACP member since he was a 
child. Most of the students had never heard of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a message they needed to hear, Reynolds said.

REP. TUCKER PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO U.S. CHARGES; COURTS: THE EX-MAYOR OF COMPTON 
IS ARRAIGNED ON BRIBERY AND TAX EVASION COUNTS. HE ACCUSES PROSECUTORS OF 
TARGETING AFRICAN AMERICANS. 
</P>

<P>
 Surrounded by ministers, family members and lawyers, Rep. Walter R. Tucker III 
pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that he solicited and accepted bribes from 
a local businessman and hid the money from the IRS while mayor of Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic congressman was released on a $10,000 signature bond and told 
not to travel outside the continental United States, unless on congressional 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the arraignment in U.S. District Court, Tucker and about three 
dozen supporters faced the media on the steps of the federal courthouse -- 
mostly to pray and criticize federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "(God's) mercy endures. My family is here. God is here," Tucker said, before 
accusing federal prosecutors of unfairly targeting high-profile African 
American men for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the list," Tucker said. "There was Marion Barry before me. There was 
O.J. Simpson before me. There was Mike Tyson and Mike (Michael) Jackson. You 
may as well call me Mike Tucker." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Tucker's supporters, who clogged the narrow halls of the federal 
courthouse in Downtown Los Angeles during his arraignment, held up picket signs 
throughout his news conference, reading: "Witch Hunt!" "Stop Racism 1994" and 
"Tucker Is Innocent!" 
</P>
<P>
 Both Tucker and his attorney, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., emphatically denied the 
charges and said they expect to prove Tucker's innocence at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker sent a letter to some backers seeking their "presence and support at my 
press conference immediately following my arraignment. . . . Your presence will 
send a strong message of support throughout the community and nation. . . . 
Should you be unable to attend, please send a representative." 
</P>
<P>
 While Tucker, a freshman congressman facing reelection this year, and his 
supporters denounced the case as race-biased prosecution, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Steven G. Madison countered that his evidence is colorblind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Race and ethnicity have never been a factor in this investigation," Madison 
said. "We received allegations of corruption, we investigated. That's exactly 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation, and eventual grand jury indictment, stemmed from a proposed 
waste-to-energy plant in Compton. According to sources close to the 
investigation, Tucker was videotaped with a hidden camera in 1991 and 1992 
accepting bribes from FBI investigators posing as businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker is accused of taking $30,000 in cash and checks in exchange for his 
promise to support the plant, proposed by Compton Energy Systems. He also 
demanded an additional $250,000, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 When the waste-to-energy proposal came before the City Council in July, 1992, 
Tucker championed the idea -- winning an exclusive negotiating agreement for 
Compton Energy Systems after a bitter council debate. The agreement between the 
company and city lapsed after a year, however, and the project was never 
revived.  
</P>
<P>
 Tucker has refused to comment on Compton Energy Systems or on his two years as 
Compton's youngest elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker's trial won't begin for at least five months. Due to the complexity of 
the case, which prosecutors said includes "tens of thousands of documents and 
30-60 hours of video and audiotape evidence," attorneys agreed to delay the 
trial date until Feb. 1, 1995. Cochran's involvement in the upcoming O.J. 
Simpson murder trial was another reason to hold back the start date, agreed 
U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall, who will hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker's only competition in the Nov. 8 election will come from Libertarian 
candidate Guy Wilson of San Pedro. In the 37th District, which includes Compton 
and parts of Carson and Hawthorne, whoever wins the Democratic primary can 
usually expect to win the election -- and Tucker easily beat his one Democratic 
challenger in June with 84% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 None of Tucker's supporters were talking about the election Monday. Most of 
them -- ministers, businessmen and longtime supporters -- said they came to the 
courthouse to show their faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe completely in his innocence," said Councilwoman Yvonne Arceneaux, a 
political unknown until Tucker backed her bid for a council seat in 1993. "I'm 
not claiming perfection for Walter. Nobody who breathes is perfect. But this is 
ridiculous."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; UPDATED DOWNTOWN PARKING STUDY OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved spending $20,000 to bring a 1990 downtown 
parking study up to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a place in downtown to put one's car can be a problem, but council 
members made it known last week that they don't want any new high-rise parking 
structures ruining the city's historic character. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the charm of what we have here is that it is a mess," Councilman Gary 
L. Hausdorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study, by KHR Associates, will offer ways to accommodate more vehicles 
in the cramped downtown, which could be changing in the next few years. Private 
developers plan to renovate the El Peon complex, and city officials are talking 
about a possible new downtown project, Historic Town Center, which is moving 
toward approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised study should be finished in January.JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; ROBBER, HIT IN SHOOTOUT, FLEES STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A midday shootout between an armed robber and a jewelry store owner Monday 
left the robber wounded and the owner shaken. The robber escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think twice," said the owner, a Tustin man in his late 20s who asked 
not to be identified. "It was either him or me. There were a lot of people in 
here that could have been hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that just before noon the would-be robber, a man in his 
mid-20s wearing a mustard-colored suit, set off the metal detector at the 
entrance of the 14K Jewelry Mart, in the Saddleback Plaza Shopping Center on El 
Toro Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Asking the owner if he had a gun, the man reached into his waistband and 
pulled a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner raced to his office and grabbed his .44-caliber revolver. Over the 
last 15 years, he said, the store had been hit by armed robbers four or five 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy pulled a gun and -- bang, bang, bang," the owner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the store at the time of the shootout, the owner said, were four 
customers and five employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all hit the ground, hugging the showcases," he said. "They were shaking 
like a leaf." 
</P>
<P>
 The robber missed, but the owner did not. The owner said he believed he hit 
the robber at least once, with a shot that passed through the man's body and 
shattered a showcase. The bullet caused the robber to drop his gun and sent 
glass shards flying throughout the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "He spun around, he went down, and I don't know what happened after that," the 
owner said. "Witnesses said he crawled out or ran." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the shooting, which involved about six rounds over a five- to 
six-second period, three other men, who police believe were the robber's 
accomplices, were walking toward the jewelry store. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they heard the shots, they made a U-turn," and ran back toward their 
two-tone, gray Chevrolet Astro van, the owner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't believe this really happened," the owner said. "It's really 
weird. I don't know how to feel . . . numb." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said "it's almost incredible to think 
that no one was injured" in the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies later found the van abandoned on a nearby residential street with 
what looked like blood on the passenger seat. It had been reported stolen in 
Mission Viejo in the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said some witnesses said it looked like the robber had been hit in the 
shoulder.MARK I. PINSKY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; NUDE DANCING CLUB OWNER TO CONTEST BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vasken Tatarian thought he had cleared all the city's hurdles after spending 
what he said was $200,000 to open a nude dance club called the Flamingo 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city threw up a big roadblock last week after some neighboring 
business owners expressed outrage over the club proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Tuesday, the City Council passed an emergency, 45-day moratorium on adult 
businesses, effectively blocking the club's opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Tatarian, 34, of Cerritos and his attorney are scheduled to meet with Mayor 
Tom Daly today and intend to address the council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have no right to do this. This is a First Amendment issue," said 
Tatarian, who owns several convenience stores with his family in the North 
County area. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they didn't want me to open my club, they could have told me from day one. 
They didn't. They waited until I spent all my money before they decided to tell 
me. What the hell is going on? It's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Jack White, however, said the city is well within its rights to 
impose the temporary ban, which prohibits sex-oriented businesses in areas 
zoned as limited industrial. 
</P>
<P>
 Tatarian wants to set up his club at 618 East Ball Road, which falls within a 
limited industrial zone. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 45-day moratorium, the city staff will study the area for its 
suitability for a sex-oriented business. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff may recommend to the council either that the nude dancing club is 
appropriate at the Ball Road site or that it, along with other similar clubs, 
should be outlawed in limited industrial zones, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses are already protesting the proposed nude dancing club. They 
argue Tatarian is using the First Amendment and the right to free expression as 
a cloak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is up to this council, Anaheim residents, property and business owners to 
do (everything) possible to keep Anaheim free from the causes of moral decay," 
said Gerald R. Knudson Jr., an attorney for Bryan Industrial Properties, which 
owns a host of adjacent properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Concurring with such complaints, council members are looking for ways to 
stymie the spread of strip clubs in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members say such clubs often increase crime and devalue surrounding 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nudie things around the city of Anaheim bother me to no end," said 
Councilman Irv Pickler. "They pull an area down and bring in the type of 
element we don't want in our city." 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how sympathetic the council may be with the concerns of 
neighboring businesses, White emphasized the council still must allow the club 
to operate somewhere in the city -- as long as it meets restrictions in the 
city's 35-page sex-oriented business ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a year old, the ordinance was forged after the city lost a legal 
battle to prevent another similar club from opening. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, a federal court struck down a previous city ordinance that banned 
nude dancing at a public establishment if the city believed such entertainment 
was detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruled the ordinance was "constitutionally vague." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has 11 "sex-oriented businesses," said White, ranging from a bikini 
bar to one other all-nude dancing club. 
</P>
<P>
 White added that there are 22 places in the city where adult businesses are 
legally permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can sympathize with people who say, 'We don't want this in our community, 
it's bad.' But the Supreme Court and the lower courts are saying you can't keep 
these things out of your community because you don't like them," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tatarian said he will run a proper establishment and that his club will not 
degrade the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flamingo Theater, which can seat up to 60 patrons, will feature nude 
dancing but will not serve alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a No. 1 Christian guy, I go to church every Sunday," Tatarian said. "I 
don't smoke. I don't even have a traffic ticket. This is a business." MARTIN 
MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY BACKS BERGESON BILL ON BAY CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday voted 5 to 1 to support a proposed state law that 
would determine the future of the Balboa Bay Club, the adjacent Terrace 
Apartments and public access to the leased property for the next 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, sponsored by Sen. Marion Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), goes to an 
Assembly committee Wednesday in hope of getting it passed during the 1994 
legislative session that ends Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bill fails in the Legislature, an ongoing dispute with the State Lands 
Commission, which has designated the property tidelands and uplands, will 
continue and jeopardize a $20-million to $30-million redevelopment plan the 
City Council approved last month for the Bay Club. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the club's planned renovation, which would include expanding the 
club from 155,000 to 189,000 square feet, adding a restaurant, ballroom, four 
conference rooms, a coffee shop and two bars and converting the 144 Terrace 
Apartments on the westerly four acres to hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, at 1221 W. Coast Highway, has been on the property since 1948, when 
the city granted a 50-year lease. In 1978, the state transferred the land to 
the city as a public trust, which requires public access. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would perpetuate the trust but allow the club to remain on the land 
by opening 95% of the 13-acre facility to the public, along with rebuilding the 
deteriorating portions of the original club so that homeowners on the hillsides 
above Coast Highway have "view corridors." 
</P>
<P>
 The club and the city also are renegotiating the lease, which expires in 2011. 
Balboa Bay Club owner Beverly Ray hopes to get an extension to 2077. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the legislation and a new lease, the renovation could fall through. 
</P>
<P>
 Any "uncertainty regarding the permissible use of (the land) would impede or 
prevent redevelopment and postpone, for more than 17 years, the public's right 
of access to the adjoining property," according to proposed legislation drafted 
by City Atty. Robert Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
 The law would provide for the city to keep 95% of lease revenues for up to 
five years after a new lease is negotiated, then 90% in succeeding years. The 
balance would go into a state fund for oversight of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 That improves the city's position from the commission's initial proposal, 
which would have siphoned 50% of revenue from the property into state and 
county accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jean Watt cast the only no vote. (Councilwoman Janice Debay was 
absent.) Watt said she wanted the state's cut of revenue reduced or half of it 
earmarked for land acquisition and improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John Hedges, who voted for the deal, said he wasn't satisfied but 
that a deadline loomed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps we should consider calling their bluff, saying thanks but no thanks. 
. . . It seems to me that it's the worst deal we could cut, taking what they'll 
give us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council compromised by authorizing city representatives to try to get the 
terms Watt proposed, but to proceed without them if necessary.HOLLY J. WAGNER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; TEEN SAYS HE THREW 'STICK' IN FATAL FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Clemente teen-ager testified Monday that he threw a block of wood he 
described as a "stick" toward a carload of youths in self-defense during an 
altercation that left 17-year-old Steve Woods speared through the head with a 
paint roller. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Penuelas, 17, testified he never meant to kill or hurt anyone in the 
Oct. 15 altercation at Calafia Beach County Park in San Clemente that resulted 
in the fatal injury. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he grabbed the block after a fistfight between a friend of his and a 
friend of Woods' in the beach parking lot. Penuelas testified he thought the 
other teen had gone to round up others at the opposite end of the lot for 
revenge. He said he threw the block at the first vehicle to leave the lot, 
which was carrying Woods, because he thought it was coming at him and his 
friend, co-defendant Julio Perez Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were coming fast at us, and I was scared," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla testified earlier that he was acting in self-defense when he threw a 
pipe toward the Chevrolet Suburban carrying Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 Penuelas and Bonilla, both of San Clemente, are among six young men and teens, 
all described by prosecutors as gang members or associates, charged with 
killing Woods. The San Clemente High School student died 25 days after 
suffering the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Penuelas and Bonilla, now 18, were juveniles at the time of the slaying but 
are being tried as adults. The non-jury trial in Santa Ana before Orange County 
Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey is expected to end today. 
</P>
<P>
 Under repeated questions from Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer, Penuelas said he 
remembered little from that night. He denied the "stick" he threw was really a 
paint roller. 
</P>
<P>
 Paer has not said who wielded the paint roller, but he has said Bonilla and 
Penuelas are responsible for killing Woods because they joined in the attack 
that caused the death. 
</P>
<P>
 A caravan of three cars, including the vehicle in which Woods was a passenger, 
was showered with bottles, rocks, beer cans, paint rollers and other items as 
they drove toward the only exit from the beach parking lot, according to court 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods' friends testified they were trying to flee the parking lot and had done 
nothing to provoke the attack. ANNA CEKOLA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TERMINAL ISLAND; 25 
PRISON INMATES TREATED FOR INTESTINAL DISORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal prison at Terminal Island has treated 25 inmates this month for an 
intestinal infection known as shigella, according to a prison official. 
</P>
<P>
 The infection, which causes diarrhea and cramping, was first reported Aug. 9 
at the 1,250-inmate prison near Los Angeles Harbor, said Warden Mark 
Henry.Inmates are being treated at the 13-bed infirmary, which has been 
equipped with extra bunk beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Shigella, or shigellosis, can be transmitted on unwashed produce, Henry said. 
The county Department of Health Services surveyed the prison kitchen Friday but 
did not pinpoint the source of the infection, he said. Five cases have been 
reported among inmates who work in food service, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The outbreak appears to be confined to the prison population, said Sharon 
Wanglin of the health department.

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY ; VOLUNTEERS HELP MEND 
LIVES OF NEEDY

 Gina Mirabella knows what it's like to be penniless -- even while driving a 
Jaguar. 
</P>
<P>
 So, she is the last person to hand out judgments while handing out food to the 
poor in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went from rags to riches and back to rags again," said Mirabella, who runs 
the emergency food pantry at MEND (Meet Each Need with Dignity), which provides 
food, clothing and English-language education, among other services, to the 
needy. 
</P>
<P>
 Each month, as MEND's food program director, Mirabella oversees the sorting 
and distribution of hundreds of boxes of food, which are given out through a 
window at the MEND facility. 
</P>
<P>
 She first came to that window several years ago as a recipient, broke and 
hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirabella, 58, is a native of Lithuania whose parents were killed during World 
War II. After growing up in an orphanage in Europe, she came to the United 
States on a scholarship and attended Ohio State and Temple universities. 
</P>
<P>
 For 17 years, before she found her way to MEND, Mirabella had lived the good 
life as a real estate broker. She was married, had a Porsche and a Jaguar, a 
boat and a house in Palos Verdes.  
</P>
<P>
 But then she and her husband invested all their assets in a farm in Oregon. 
They lost everything and soon the couple divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that Mirabella discovered what it was like to have nothing, but 
still drive an expensive car. She was unable to sell the car because of liens 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless, Mirabella returned to the Los Angeles-area to live with friends in 
the San Fernando Valley. She lost her identification, preventing her from 
getting a job. She went to MEND for help. Eventually, she started volunteering 
for the agency during the day while working the graveyard shift as a waitress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is any shame in needing help," said Mirabella, who five 
years ago, after working as a volunteer for two years, was hired by MEND. She 
is now back on her feet and has remarried, saying hard times "can happen to 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Many MEND workers, both volunteers and paid employees, are former recipients 
of the agency's services. Others became volunteers after being assigned to MEND 
to pay off a court-imposed debt of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need at least five volunteers daily that could be trained to do certain 
jobs," Mirabella said. Volunteers run the distribution window, move and open 
boxes.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Mirabella needs drivers with clean records to pick up donated 
food from local grocery stores. Some current volunteers are teen-agers with 
summer job training programs who will be going back to school soon. 
</P>
<P>
 MEND was created in 1973 by a group of lay parishioners from northeastern San 
Fernando Valley churches. The food distribution service is open on Mondays, 
Tuesdays and Fridays. In July, MEND provided food to 5,670 people.  
</P>
<P>
 MEND also needs volunteers to teach English as a second language classes in 
the fall, said Sister Christian Jones, co-director of the language program. 
Volunteers now include retired teachers, a real-estate broker, a retired 
building inspector and a garage mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very family-oriented atmosphere," said Jones, a member of the 
Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus, who help with the classes. 
</P>
<P>
 MEND volunteer teachers also give lessons in subjects other than English, such 
as banking, real estate, basic health care and how to avoid scams. 
</P>
<P>
 The language program has about 20 teachers signed up now and needs at least 
twice that number for the fall classes. Jones said MEND also needs a volunteer 
who is familiar with computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective volunteers should call (818) 896-0246. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Involved is a weekly listing of volunteering opportunities. Please 
address prospective listings to Getting Involved, Los Angeles Times, 20000 
Prairie St., Chatsworth 91311. Or fax them to (818) 772-3338.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: KOREATOWN; ARMORED 
TRUCK GUARDS KILL ROBBER, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An armed man was fatally wounded Monday while allegedly trying to rob three 
armored truck guards near a Bank of America branch in Koreatown, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 The man wounded in the 8:26 a.m. shooting at Olympic Boulevard and Western 
Avenue died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said Los Angeles Police Lt. Ken 
Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Loomis armored truck guards had just made a delivery to the bank and 
were returning to their truck when the gunman walked toward a nearby bus bench 
and stopped, Lady said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the guards got close to the man, whose identity was not released pending 
notification of next of kin, he pulled a revolver from his waistband and 
pointed it at them, Lady said. Two of the guards then opened fire, wounding the 
gunman.  
</P>
<P>
 Police questioned a man seen running from the scene, but he was released. They 
said the slain robber apparently acted alone.

 The settlement marks the final payout in a series of lawsuits related to a 
1986 police raid in El Sereno, which left a family's apartment trashed and one 
man with a broken nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the council has agreed to pay $550,000 to the Larez family to avoid 
trials that could result in judgments higher than those awarded by other 
juries, said Stephen Yagman, the plaintiffs' attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Keiko Larez charged that police violated her civil rights when she was taken 
to the Hollenbeck station five days before the July 13, 1986, raid on her 
family's home.  
</P>
<P>
 Police were investigating a gang-related murder in which her brother Eddie was 
as a suspect. Their father's nose was broken when police arrived at their home 
with a search warrant. Keiko Larez contended that officers handcuffed her; a 
detective denied that and said she went to the station voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury had ordered the detective to pay $55,000 in damages. The city appealed 
and a new trial was ordered, but City Atty. James Hahn urged the council to 
accept the settlement.

<P>
 A 25-year-old man was stabbed to death just before midnight Sunday after a 
domestic fight, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who lived in Anaheim, has not been identified by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Diaz, 30, of Garden Grove was arrested on suspicion of murder, Sgt. 
Steve Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were called to a home in the 2800 block of West Ball Road after a 
report of an assault on a woman by her live-in boyfriend, who fled the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 While investigating, authorities heard a dispute nearby between Diaz and the 
woman's boyfriend, Rodig said. Rodig said Diaz is a friend of the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz stabbed the man and tried to flee but was arrested and was being held at 
the Anaheim City Jail, police said. No bail has been set, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified man was treated at the scene by paramedics and taken to UCI 
Medical Center in Orange, where he died.MARK I. PINSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan that calls for the relocation of two buildings on Irvine's historic 
Buffalo Ranch to the fairgrounds in Costa Mesa will come before the Orange 
County Fair Board for a vote Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was released Monday after weeks of negotiations between fair 
officials and the Irvine Co., which owns the Buffalo Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the Irvine Co. would pay to move and rehabilitate two of 
the most picturesque ranch buildings, including the famous silo structure. The 
company would also pay to have asbestos removed from the buildings. The total 
project is expected to cost more than $300,000.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COURT TOLD VOTE ON AIRPORT NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The group behind a ballot measure that asks voters to designate El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station as a commercial airport filed court papers Monday to block an 
attempt by the city of Lake Forest to have the initiative invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents, filed in Orange County Superior Court by the Committee for 
21,000 New Jobs, contend that Lake Forest officials are trying to deprive "the 
people of Orange County of their right of initiative" at "the eleventh hour" of 
a campaign drive to transform the base into a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest officials, who are opposed to such a facility at the El Toro base, 
sued the county registrar of voters and the pro-airport committee two weeks ago 
contending that the initiative process does not properly address the impacts of 
an airport on traffic, noise levels and other countywide planning 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is asking that a judge remove the initiative from the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 A court hearing on the issue has been scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Judge Donald Smallwood, who is presiding over the 
dispute, said earlier this month that timing is crucial. He plans to resolve 
the issue by Aug. 29, the last day that Donald Tanney, the county registrar of 
voters, can delete the initiative before the ballot goes to print, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana W. Reed, treasurer of the group that gathered more than 114,000 signature 
to qualify the pro-airport initiative, accused Lake Forest officials of 
challenging the ballot measure late in the campaign in an effort to divert the 
group's attention from the election itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a totally political move," Reed said. "The whole idea of Lake Forest's 
was to keep us busy, but it's not going to work. The campaign is still moving 
along. This is just a completely frivolous lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest City Atty. Jerry Patterson could not be reached for comment 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the initiative passes by a majority of the voters, the county's General 
Plan would be amended to designate 2,000 acres of the base as an airport and 
require that the remaining acreage be identified as compatible with an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-airport group argued in its court documents Monday that Lake Forest's 
request to invalidate the initiative is "ill-conceived and ill-timed" and 
should be denied. The group contends the city has plenty of time to challenge 
the legality of the initiative after a vote, and if it is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the group states that the initiative is not legally flawed. MATT 
LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; PARENTS, TEACHER ADD COLOR TO CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A few surprises await students at W.R. Nelson Elementary School when classes 
resume in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four-foot-long "caterpillars" with letters of the alphabet inside of 
them have been painted on the sidewalk near the kindergarten classrooms and on 
the playground close to the first- and second-grade classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. map, measuring 16 feet long and 27 feet wide, also has been painted in 
the playground for third-, fourth- and fifth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents painted the caterpillars and the U.S. map earlier this month to add a 
"touch of color" and as educational tools, according to Polly Martin, who 
coordinated the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it helps make our school look nicer," said Martin. "The children will 
be happy to see them." 
</P>
<P>
 Half a dozen parents and one teacher participated in the two-day project, 
organized by the school's Parent-Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good social activity for the parents," said PTA President Tammis 
Berkheimer, adding that she got the idea from other schools in the Tustin 
Unified School District that use the paintings to add color to their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The caterpillar paintings are in pairs -- a "boy" caterpillar with the letters 
in blue and a "girl" caterpillar with the letters in pink. The letters are 
inside the belly of the caterpillars, which were painted green. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nature is important to the kids," said Jean Brown, a first-grade teacher who 
helped paint the caterpillars. "The more we expose them to insects and animals, 
the better we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Lack, whose son Ryan will be entering first grade in September, said 
that the paintings may also encourage parents to get involved with the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people walking in the campus to say, 'Wow, who did this?' And they may 
want to get involved," Lack said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; TEEN FOUND GUILTY IN '93 MALL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Santa Ana man was found guilty Monday of four counts of 
attempted murder for shooting and seriously wounding a 13-year-old girl last 
summer in front of terrified shoppers at the Westminster Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Phong Thanh Dang, who was a student at La Quinta High School at the time of 
the July 8, 1993, shooting, sat without expression as a clerk announced the 
verdict of an Orange County Superior Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to premeditated attempted murder, the jury found him guilty of 
street terrorism and of committing the crime as part of gang involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. David R. LaBahn said Dang had become angry at a group of 
girls, allegedly also gang members, that afternoon at the mall who, among other 
things, had been staring at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got angry and went out to his car and got his gun and went back in the 
mall," LaBahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Dang fired at least four shots from a second level of the 
mall into a group of youths standing below. 
</P>
<P>
 A 13-year-old girl was struck in the back, while another bullet passed through 
the pant leg of a 15-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution contended that two other girls also were in the line of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Dang testified he was innocent and someone else did the shooting. His lawyer, 
Thomas Avdeef, could not be reached for comment late Monday. ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; DRUG HEIST BACKED BY APPARENT GRENADE

<P>
 Police on Monday were seeking a gray-suited robber who demanded drugs from a 
pharmacist and displayed what looked like a hand grenade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw a real hand grenade and I don't want to know if it was real or 
not," said Terry Bottorff, pharmacist and owner of the Druggist, a store on 
Brookhurst Street in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying a briefcase, the man entered the store about 10:45 a.m. and put two 
boxes of condoms on the counter, Bottorff said. He then put down a handwritten 
list of about a dozen pain-killing drugs that he said he wanted, Bottorff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them were pretty heavy-duty pain pills that a little drugstore 
doesn't stock," Bottorff said. The man opened his jacket to reveal what looked 
like a grenade strapped to his waist and then said he had a gun, Bottorff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave him 20 to 30 Valiums and 20 to 30 sleeping pills," Bottorff said. 
Bottorff said he also put the condoms in the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 The man left behind a driver's license with a Beverly Hills address, which 
police are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach police said the man is white and in his early 30s, 5-feet-10 
and 180 pounds, with brown hair and eyes.MARK I. PINSKY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; COUNCIL OKS FUNDS FOR HISTORICAL PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's new historical district park has moved closer to completion with 
the City Council's approval of a final budget of $683,000 for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The district includes the First Congregational Church, the former Stage Stop 
Hotel and two houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1887 Whitaker-Jaynes house and an older squatter's shack called the Bacon 
House were loaded on pneumatic dollies and moved from their old foundations on 
Manchester Boulevard to the district site on Beach Boulevard in early June. The 
historical park is across from the Civic Center Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly $100,000 of the budget went to moving and rehabilitating the houses, 
which had been damaged in the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the funds paid for the district's land and will finance the 
extensive landscaping that will turn the half-acre lot into a gardenlike park, 
said Wes Morgan, director of recreation, parks and community services. 
</P>
<P>
 The park should be ready for visitors later in the fall.LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; JUDGE TO RULE TODAY ON TRAVEL FOR HENLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge is scheduled to decide today whether Rams cornerback Darryl 
Henley will be permitted to play in games away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, indicted on drug charges last October, is seeking permission to travel 
outside the federal court system's Central District of California, now 
forbidden as a condition of his bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Henley is a flight risk, but his attorneys say he cannot be 
denied a chance to earn a living. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is scheduled at 3:30 p.m. in front of Judge Gary L. Taylor in U.S. 
District Court. Henley's attorneys are seeking a favorable ruling so that 
Henley can travel to San Diego on Thursday for the team's next exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley had to leave practice Monday after pulling his right hamstring on pass 
coverage, and there is a chance he could miss Thursday night's game regardless 
of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just aggravated it," he said. "It has been tight for a few days. As far as 
playing (Thursday), I'll have to let you know Tuesday. Anytime you have a 
little ding like that, you have to wait until the next day to tell." MARK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; KNOTT'S STUNTMAN'S INJURIES STILL CRITICAL 
</P>

<P>
 The veteran stunt performer injured during a mock gunfight at Knott's Berry 
Farm over the weekend remained in critical condition Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Mead, 29, sustained head injuries Saturday when he fell 25 feet from a 
water tower during an afternoon performance of the Calico Square stunt show -- 
a move park officials said he had performed hundreds of times. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman at UCI Medical Center in Orange said Mead was listed in critical 
condition with head trauma following emergency surgery over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The once-a-day show was suspended for the second time Monday out of respect 
for the injured performer and to allow park officials to investigate the 
incident, said Knott's spokesman Bob Ochsner. But the same cast of about 10 
stunt performers went ahead with a separate Wild West show, which they put on 
three times a day, Ochsner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Cal-OSHA plan to investigate the incident to make sure there 
were no violations of workplace safety rules, said agency spokesman Rick Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochsner said it was unclear how Mead, an eight-year veteran at the park, came 
to be injured. 
</P>
<P>
 In the show, performers enacting a gun battle are shot at and tumble from 
structures onto safe backstage landing areas out of the view of spectators. 
Mead apparently missed the spot and fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the audience members watching the show saw him fall," Ochsner said. 
"We will probably have to talk to the performer." 
</P>
<P>
 Ochsner said it was the first serious injury to a performer in more than 50 
years of stunt shows at the theme park. KEN ELLINGWOOD

NEW ATTORNEY DENIED FOR PRATT AT PAROLE HEARING; PRISONS: KATHLEEN CLEAVER 
WON'T BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THE CONVICTED BLACK PANTHER AT SESSION WEDNESDAY. 
OFFICIAL SAYS MORE NOTICE WAS NEEDED TO ADD A NEW LAWYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The State Board of Prison Terms has denied former Black Panther Party official 
Kathleen Cleaver permission to represent her onetime Panther colleague Elmer G. 
(Geronimo) Pratt at his parole hearing this week, Cleaver said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt, 46, has been in prison for more than 23 years, serving a life sentence 
for the fatal shooting of a Santa Monica woman during a 1968 robbery that 
netted less than $50. His supporters and a retired FBI agent say he was framed 
as part of the FBI's effort to "neutralize" the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 His 13th parole hearing, scheduled for Wednesday, comes against a backdrop of 
renewed efforts to win his release. Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti is 
reviewing the case, prompted by a detailed report from crusading lay minister 
Jim McCloskey who vigorously argues Pratt's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Those calling for Pratt's release over the years have included Amnesty 
International, members of Congress and a cross-section of Los Angeles' most 
prominent clergy and civil rights leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 None of Pratt's attorneys believe his release will be ordered Wednesday, 
however, and a spokeswoman for Garcetti said the office will oppose parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaver, who said she was denied permission to visit Pratt on Sunday, called 
the decision blocking her from representing him retaliatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "First they don't want me visiting him, and they don't want me in the room 
representing him," said Cleaver, a Yale law graduate and a law professor at 
Emory University in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt's long-time attorney, Stuart Hanlon of San Francisco, said he received a 
letter from Board of Prison Terms chairman James W. Neilsen late Monday, saying 
Cleaver "will not be permitted to participate in the hearing but will be 
permitted to observe it from an adjacent room equipped with audio and video 
monitors." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am flabbergasted," Hanlon said. "I've dealt with the prison system for 20 
years. I lost track of the fear they have . . . of their image of Kathleen 
Cleaver and Geronimo Pratt." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Pratt requested that Cleaver represent him. "They're really trying to 
silence this woman," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaver flew to Los Angeles from Algiers to testify at Pratt's 1972 trial, 
supporting his defense that he was in Oakland on Dec. 18, 1968, the day 
Caroline Olsen was shot on a tennis court in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanlon said at a news conference Monday that there would be no hearing without 
Cleaver as Pratt's attorney. He softened that position later in the day, saying 
he and Cleaver will meet with Pratt at the prison today. Their decision about 
participating in the hearing will be based on what they feel is best for Pratt, 
Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Board of Prison Terms Executive Theodore R. Rich Sr. said all along 
there would be a hearing. "We will have a hearing whether Mr. Hanlon, Mr. Pratt 
or anyone else assembles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich said he has "bent over backward" to give Pratt every opportunity to 
present his case. He noted that the board allowed an attorney from Washington 
to represent Pratt at his last parole hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich said security requires time to accommodate a change in lawyers because 
the new lawyer has to be cleared to enter a prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanlon said he knows of no written rule saying an inmate cannot be represented 
by two lawyers. "There certainly is no kind of written rule that they need some 
kind of notice way in advance," he said. "They were aware of Kathleen coming 10 
days ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt has steadfastly maintained his innocence, saying he was in Oakland on 
the date of the murder. Pratt insists that the FBI had him under surveillance 
on that date, and that its wiretap logs would show that he was in Oakland.

<P>
 Retired FBI agent M. Wesley Swearingen says that Pratt was framed. Swearingen 
said he saw authorization for the wiretaps. But no logs from those taps have 
ever been produced. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaver testified in 1972 that he was in Oakland attending party meetings when 
Olsen and her husband were shot and robbed on a Santa Monica tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in the case has grown over the past several months since Garcetti 
agreed to review Pratt's conviction. McCloskey, whose efforts led to the 
release of Clarence Chance and Benny Powell in 1992, argued Pratt's innocence 
in a detailed report submitted to Garcetti last year. Chance and Powell spent 
17 years in prison after they were wrongfully convicted of murdering a Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're calling on the district attorney's office to release (Pratt) as they 
did with Chance and Powell," said attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of two 
lawyers who represented Pratt at his trial in 1972. "They have the wrong man. 
They know they have the wrong man. No one has enough courage and integrity to 
come forward and say: 'Let him out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And no one from the district attorney's office will do that on Wednesday. A 
spokeswoman said Garcetti's office will oppose parole for Pratt as it has at 
all of his earlier hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt was implicated in Olsen's murder by former Panther Julius C. Butler, who 
testified that Pratt confessed to the crime to him. Butler, now an attorney who 
serves as chairman of the board at First African Methodist Episcopal Church, 
also testified that he never had been an informant for the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI documents released later, however, showed that Butler had more than 30 
documented contacts with FBI agents in a two-year period, and that the bureau 
classified him as a "probationary racial informant."

LAWSUITS CLAIM HILLSIDE HOME HAD FATAL FLAW; COURTS: FAMILIES OF COUPLE KILLED 
IN QUAKE CONTEND THAT BUYERS WERE NOT TOLD ABOUT AN ENGINEERING REPORT THAT HAD 
SCARED OFF ANOTHER PROSPECTIVE BUYER. 
</P>

 Marc Yobs knew he wanted the house from the moment he walked inside and, like 
everyone else who saw it, he was awe-struck by the view. 
</P>
<P>
 From its hillside perch in Sherman Oaks, nothing stood between the 
contemporary home's north-facing wall of glass and the sweeping Valley vista 
below. "Not even rooftops," said Yobs' brother Dave.  
</P>
<P>
 The view was so compelling that Yobs, a 30-year-old manager in a film 
production company, stretched his budget to meet the $400,000 asking price, and 
with his longtime girlfriend, Karen Osterholt, moved into the house at 3855 
Sherwood Place on Valentine's Day, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two years later, they were killed when their aerie collapsed in the 
Northridge quake and slid down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Yobs was fatally misled during the sale has become the subject of twin 
wrongful death lawsuits filed last month by his and Osterholt's families in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. The central allegation in both is that the sellers -- a 
group of investors led by attorney Lawrence R. Gordon -- withheld a critical 
engineering report that had scared off another prospective buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon and his alleged partners -- Daniel J. Eget, Nathan J. Reese, and 
contractor Richard Robinson and his wife, Margarette -- have either refused to 
comment, not returned phone calls or could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Osterholt's relatives, who have filed a palimony suit against Yobs' parents 
over an estate that includes his $300,000 life insurance policy, also declined 
to be interviewed for this article. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Dave Yobs and his family's attorneys described it, the story of how 
Osterholt and Marc Yobs got the house is filled with sad twists and turns, 
including the fact that Dave Yobs, a Woodland Hills real estate agent, 
represented his younger brother in the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers began looking in the winter of 1992, Dave Yobs said, 
concentrating on the Sherman Oaks-Studio City area so that Yobs would have an 
easy commute to his office in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Osterholt and Yobs' parents came along on the day they went to Sherwood Place, 
and when they drove away his mother, Margaret, teased her ambitious firebrand 
of a younger son -- "Now that's a Marc house." 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Dave Yobs said, there were several unusual aspects to the sale, 
including the unavailability of the sellers to directly discuss the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 One query involved a name change on the title that the brothers noticed when 
the sale was about to close, from Richard and Margarette Robinson as the 
sellers to a company called Danat Investment. Yobs' attorney, Alexander 
Robertson IV, alleges that Gordon is connected to Danat, through its partners 
Eget and Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 When the brothers asked about the switch, according to Dave Yobs, they were 
told it had been done for tax purposes, which seemed plausible. 
</P>
<P>
 What they were not told, the lawsuits claim, was that the titleholder had 
changed twice -- from the Robinsons to a company called Properties Du Monde 
Inc. and then to Danat. The day after that title transfer, Properties Du Monde 
-- whose officers included Gordon and the Robinsons -- was dissolved as a 
corporation, the lawsuits claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson says both companies were used to insulate Gordon and his partners 
from responsibility for defects in the extensively remodeled house. 
</P>
<P>
 Christina S. Kruger, an associate of Robertson's who grew up with the Yobs 
brothers in Woodland Hills, was approached by mutual friends at Yobs' and 
Osterholt's joint funeral and asked to investigate. Although many houses in the 
neighborhood suffered severe damage during the quake, theirs had been the only 
one to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Kruger and Robertson, who specialize in construction-defect litigation, 
began looking into the matter, they said they found troubling evidence -- 
including the title chain, which they said took their staff six months to piece 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks after the funeral, someone phoned Dave Yobs and said he had some 
confidential information that he could not in good conscience withhold from the 
grieving family. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an engineer's report, commissioned by the other possible buyer, that 
noted a serious deformation in the foundation and said further investigation 
was warranted to determine the cause of the bulging concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief report by the Oro Engineering Corp. was enough to dissuade his 
client, a corporate manager named Jeffrey Malmberg, from going through with the 
sale even though he, too, had been enthralled by the view.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB WORK BEGINS ANEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a two-year delay, workers will resume construction of the future home of 
the Boys and Girls Club at Mile Square Regional Park this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction has been delayed because of unexpected work to stabilize the 
ground, lack of money and requirements attached to federal grants earmarked for 
the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the City Council approved a revised agreement on the use of the 
federal money for the $1.6-million project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a pipe dream anymore. In three months, we're going to see a shell 
completed," said Chris Schneider, executive director of the Boys and Girls 
Clubs of Huntington Valley, which also operates a Huntington Beach club. 
</P>
<P>
 The city awarded the club $93,150 in federal money, and $19,000 of that amount 
has been spent on plans and designs. The remaining $74,150 was to go toward 
construction of the 19,000-square-foot building. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city's agreement for the use of the federal grant required the club to 
post a performance bond ensuring that the building would be completed.  
</P>
<P>
 Bids received for the required bond were in excess of $24,000. Club officials 
did not want to spend the grant money for the bond but use it for the project 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement also required that the city of Fountain Valley be named on the 
bond, but bond companies would insure only the club and the contractor, 
Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so restrictive that it was impossible to satisfy," Schneider said. 
"We've been looking for other avenues for the last four months and couldn't 
find any." 
</P>
<P>
 The revised agreement allows the federal grant to be deferred and awarded to 
the club when the building is completed. It will then be used to construct the 
club's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said the council's action means a performance bond is not needed and 
construction can start immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got enough cash on hand to put up the entire shell -- the roof, walls, 
windows, doors -- to build a totally secured facility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This phase of construction is expected to be completed in three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has been on the drawing board for the last decade, and 
fund-raising has been in full force for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Cook, president of the organization's board of directors, said that when 
the community sees the building finally rising, "people will realize it's a 
sincere project. They've been looking at vacant ground for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said $1 million has been raised through individual donations, 
fund-raisers, corporate gifts and grants. So far, about $600,000 has been spent 
on foundation, grading and unexpected geological work on the site, off 
Brookhurst Street near the Cultural and Recreation Center. The geological work 
alone increased costs by $230,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $500,000 to $600,000 in donations is needed to complete the building's 
interior and cover landscaping costs, Schneider said. If the money is raised 
during the next few months, the club will open by next spring, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is now at the vacant Arthur D. Nieblas School.DEBRA CANO

EX-TUSTIN GYNECOLOGIST PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO MAIL FRAUD; COURTS: IVAN C. NAMIHAS 
FACES FEDERAL CHARGES THAT HE BILLED PATIENTS FOR UNNECESSARY TESTS AND 
TREATMENTS. STATE MEDICAL OFFICIALS REVOKED HIS LICENSE AFTER MORE THAN 100 
SEXUAL ABUSE COMPLAINTS BY HIS PATIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first appearance before a federal magistrate in Orange County, former 
Tustin gynecologist Ivan C. Namihas pleaded not guilty Monday to mail fraud for 
allegedly billing his patients for unnecessary tests and treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by his wife, Rebecca, and attorneys from California and Nevada, 
Namihas entered the plea before U.S. Magistrate Elgin Edwards in an arraignment 
that lasted less than one minute. Edwards set a trial date of Oct. 11 before 
U.S. District Court Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler. 
</P>
<P>
 Namihas, 61, escaped state criminal charges because of expired statutes of 
limitations after more than 100 sexual abuse complaints by his patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of women complained to state medical authorities that Namihas had 
fondled, masturbated or otherwise sexually abused them. Many of the alleged 
instances of abuse dated back to the late 1960s and continued through 1992, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 State medical authorities revoked Namihas' license in May, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities sought mail fraud charges after the case was publicized 
last year on ABC's "PrimeTime Live." The federal charges, contained in a grand 
jury indictment in Los Angeles, allege 14 instances between August, 1989, and 
April, 1992, in which Namihas fraudulently billed patients and insurers for 
"unnecessary and improper examinations," collecting nearly $16,000 in payments. 
There is no federal jurisdiction over crimes of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a navy blue suit, Namihas completed a USA Today crossword puzzle in 
the hallway of the federal building as his wife, whom he married a little more 
than a year ago, took notes and shielded her husband from reporters. The couple 
live in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Ivan and Rebecca Namihas walked quickly out of the federal 
building holding hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the indictment alleges, Ivan Namihas, as an Orange County physician, 
misled patients by giving them false diagnoses and unnecessary tests," said 
Jonathan Shapiro, the assistant U.S. attorney who is prosecuting the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In some of the treatments, the indictment alleges, Namihas performed painful 
laser surgery on patients and billed for the procedures even when test results 
and biopsies came back negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul S. Meyer, Namihas' attorney in Orange County, said little about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with the U.S. attorney's office that it would be inappropriate to 
comment about any facts of the case at this time," he said. "We are looking 
forward to trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer said the trial is expected to last two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Namihas faces a maximum penalty of 70 years in federal prison, a $250,000 fine 
and three years of supervised probation if convicted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Inspection Service in Santa Ana assisted in the investigation.

COSTA MESA TRASH-COLLECTION FEE TO INCREASE; GOVERNMENT: THE SMALL RAISE -- 
$3.15 A YEAR -- WILL BE USED TO FINANCE NOVEMBER'S SANITARY DISTRICT ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Residents will pay $3.15 more a year for trash pickup to pay for the Sanitary 
District's November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Three seats are open on the board, and district manager Rob Hamers said it 
will cost roughly $18,000 to hold the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, on a 4-0 vote last week, approved increasing the rate to $147.56 a 
year from $144.41 -- a 2.18% increase. The district has 250 fewer houses at 
which to make pickups this year, and the city's trash-hauling company has 
boosted its price by less than 1%, two other factors that contributed to a hike 
in fares, Hamers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase, which will last until the end of the fiscal year next July, 
should show up on residents' property tax bills, Hamers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Florine Reichle, assistant manager of the district, praised the low increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important to the board to keep the cost down and give the best 
possible service," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichle, who lives in Orange, said that city raised trash rates an additional 
$3 a month. "And ours is only $3 a year. You're talking about nickels and 
dimes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another matter, the board is trying to cut down on the number of scavengers 
rummaging through residents' garbage cans in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to find ways of keeping people from going through the trash," 
Hamers said. "We have to identify them and dissuade them from doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Articles pointing out that scavenging is illegal have been published in the 
city's newsletter, and the board is trying to talk some residents into putting 
stickers on their bins that would say that. 
</P>
<P>
 The scavengers hit the bins in the middle of the night or in the early morning 
hours, looking for recyclables such as newspapers, aluminum cans and plastics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just set our newspapers aside and the people pick it up -- that way they 
don't go through the trash," said Nate Reade, a member of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution, Reade said, is to always put the lid on the trash can.

PARK SCOREBOARDS, PROJECTS PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Little Leaguers and other sports teams at Handy Park will soon see their hits 
and misses light up on electronic scoreboards. 
</P>
<P>
 It's part of a $360,000 development package of city and county park funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the money will go for Phase 2 of Belmont Park near the new 
Southridge Tract residential subdivision on Via Escola Avenue near Meats 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is putting up $250,000 for Belmont and the county is adding $100,000 
in the form of an Orange County Urban Parks grant. The money will pay for 
construction of restrooms, playground equipment and a basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city and the county are each putting up $5,000 for the Handy 
Park scoreboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2.11 acres of land for Belmont Park was deeded to the city in lieu of fees 
by Standard Pacific Development Co. when it planned the neighborhood. The 
developer completed some preliminary work on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez selected the park projects for the county grant in 
late July. "It's a nice grant," said Community Services Manager Gabe Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said residents can expect to see the Belmont improvements completed by 
next spring or summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Handy Park is off East Collins Avenue near Handy Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Field lighting was installed there last fall to extend playing time for youth 
groups, Garcia said.

UC IRVINE ENGLISH PROFESSOR GETS $106,000 HUMANITIES GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine English Prof. John Carlos Rowe has been awarded a $106,000 grant 
from the National Endowment for the Humanities to organize a five-week summer 
institute next year for high school, college and university teachers. The 
institute will focus on multicultural issues in American literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "A $106,000 grant for the humanities is an eyebrow-raiser these days," UCI 
spokesman Scott Nelson said. "Humanities funding is hard to come by." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowe, 48, director of the UCI Critical Theory Institute, will recruit 40 
educators from Southern California to take part in the 1995 summer institute. 
Guest lecturers will discuss how to incorporate multicultural issues in the 
teaching of American literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are now being accepted for the institute. For more information, 
call the Critical Theory Institute at (714) 856-6719.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; SIX MORE YEARS ON A TIGHTROPE?; ZEDILLO'S TASK IS TO 
KEEP OPENING THE SYSTEM, WHICH MEANS WEAKENING HIS PARTY, WITHOUT ALIENATING 
ANYONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WAYNE A. CORNELIUS and JOHN BAILEY, Wayne A. Cornelius is director of the 
Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego. John Bailey is acting director 
of the Center for Latin American Studies at Georgetown University. They were 
accredited observers of Sunday's election. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunday's stunning resurgence of voter support for Mexico's Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI) may turn out, paradoxically, to be the catalytic 
event that eventually brings down the world's longest-surviving 
one-party-dominant regime, perhaps as soon as the next presidential election, 
in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The extraordinarily heavy voter turnout and the relatively insignificant 
number of abuses or violations of electoral laws proved beyond question that 
Mexico's newly reformed electoral system worked. Whatever they may have thought 
of the candidates and their platforms, Mexicans showed that such reforms as 
freeing the electoral machinery from government control, staffing polling 
places with ordinary citizens chosen by lot rather than the usual 
PRI-affiliated bosses and their minions, issuing new, high-tech voter ID cards 
and revealing presidential candidates to the public in a totally new way (the 
face-to-face, televised debate) greatly increased their confidence in the 
security of the electoral system and aroused their interest sufficiently to 
participate in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Mexico can move on to a new agenda, which poses challenges no less 
formidable than holding an open, fair election: how to modernize a political 
system deformed by 65 years of presidentialism and single-party rule at the 
national level, and how to consolidate the economic reforms of the past six 
years while attending to the massive social-welfare deficit and the 
inequalities in wealth distribution that those reforms have either exacerbated 
or failed to reduce. Social tensions grounded in these problems will inevitably 
increase during the next six years, as large segments of the population feel 
the full impacts of a flood of NAFTA-facilitated U.S. imports and the 
privatization of ejido (communally held) farm land.  
</P>
<P>
 The present anachronistic party system is ill-equipped to deal with this new 
policy agenda. Moreover, it now confronts a politically mobilized civil society 
that has clearly outgrown the confines of one-party rule and its authoritarian 
trappings. If the new electoral system is maintained, turnout in all future 
contested elections will likely be high, tolerance for the usual electoral 
chicanery by PRI apparatchiks will approach zero and voters will demand greater 
accountability from those elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's returns should not be read as evidence that the public believes that 
the PRI has somehow reinvented itself and purged itself of its corrupt, abusive 
elements. Ernesto Zedillo and the vast majority of his party's congressional 
candidates were elected by a basically unreformed PRI that has learned to play 
the democratic game while wielding traditional resources on a staggering scale 
that no opposition party could have matched. 
</P>
<P>
 The key question now facing Mexico is how Zedillo and his inner circle will 
interpret Sunday's vote. Will it be seen as a mandate to continue the opening 
of the political system launched by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari? Or 
will Zedillo, perceiving no incentive for further tinkering with the system, 
succumb to the temptation to leave the most dysfunctional element of that 
system -- the PRI itself -- to the devices of the old-style politicians upon 
whom he relied so heavily in his campaign?  
</P>
<P>
 Optimists will argue that Zedillo has the skills and support, both at home and 
abroad, to craft policies that can make the economic reforms of the Salinas 
presidency socially tolerable and politically sustainable in the long term, 
while encouraging the huge flows of new investment that will be needed to 
rebuild Mexico's employment base. A mature electorate knows the costs of 
inflationary populist improvisation and will not be expecting a quick fix to 
the country's social problems. Zedillo might even be able to renegotiate those 
aspects of the North American Free Trade Agreement that are having the most 
negative impacts on small and medium-sized Mexican producers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the political side, Zedillo's stated commitment to give his party complete 
autonomy in the selection of its candidates might expedite the emergence of the 
kind of energetic, new-style leadership that presidential impositions have 
systematically discouraged. Decentralization could proceed as more financial 
resources -- not just social-welfare programs like Salinas' National Solidarity 
Program -- are channeled through state and municipal governments. A combination 
of citizen demands and technical programs can yield major improvements in law 
enforcement. Opposition parties can move on to modern roles of devising 
workable solutions to pressing issues not being addressed adequately by the 
government, while simultaneously investing more heavily in building grass-roots 
organizational strength. 
</P>
<P>
 A much less positive scenario also can be envisioned: Zedillo takes Sunday's 
vote as a mandate for strong economic medicine, maintaining a tight-wage policy 
and other stringent anti-inflation measures. An exhausted and increasingly 
underemployed or unemployed public turns to forms of protest that undermine the 
confidence of investors. The overwhelmingly PRI-dominated Congress elected 
Sunday will provide no effective checks on executive authority. Efforts to 
reform law enforcement and the judiciary are subordinated to machine politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, continuing this scenario: the politically inexperienced president, 
lacking the vision, skill or interest to reinforce pro-reform elements of his 
party, does nothing to halt its deterioration. Rather than a rejuvenated, 
reformist PRI leadership at state and local levels, there would be a stronger 
alliance among old-guard politicians aimed at preserving the machinery of 
authoritarian control that has provoked serious protests and instability in the 
recent past (Chiapas is only the most egregious case). And opposition parties 
would continue to operate with an intransigent, anti-system mentality, typified 
by the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution, under Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas' leadership. Such a siege mentality inhibits the institutionalization 
of opposition parties and diminishes their credibility in the eyes of the 
average voter. 
</P>
<P>
 If this second scenario should materialize, the Zedillo presidency could 
culminate in ungovernability and a highly conflicted transition to a more 
democratic regime six years from now. If so, Mexico's current year of barely 
controlled social and political tensions could easily become six more years of 
living dangerously.

LOCAL CRIME FIGHTER SLAIN BY HUSBAND, POLICE SAY; VIOLENCE: PALMDALE MAN HAD 
NAMED A SQUATTER IN THE SLAYING OF TERI LYNN PEITZ IN CONNECTION WITH HER 
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH ACTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Palmdale man who claimed that his wife was shot to death because of her 
crime-fighting work as a Neighborhood Watch organizer was charged Monday with 
killing the woman himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the infamous case of Charles M. Stuart Jr. in Boston, husband Jeffrey D. 
Peitz, 38, at first claimed that an African-American man had committed the Aug. 
12 slaying of Teri Lynn Peitz, 37, as she sat watching television in their 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators learned that the sus pect named by Jeffrey Peitz had a solid 
alibi, and Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Portillo said other evidence incriminates 
the dead woman's husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man did it," said the prosecutor, who filed one count of murder against 
Peitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are parallels between the Peitz and Stuart cases, one key 
difference exists, Portillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart told Boston police that his wife, who was 7 1/2 months pregnant, was 
abducted and killed in 1989 by an African-American gunman who leaped into the 
couple's car as they were leaving a childbirth class. Stuart later picked a 
suspect out of a police lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Palmdale case, Peitz gave investigators the name of a man who allegedly 
had been living in a nearby house as an illegal squatter, saying the man had 
engaged in angry confrontations with the Peitzes and other Neighborhood Watch 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutor Portillo said Monday: "The man that he named has conclusive 
proof that he was in the state of Michigan at the time" of the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Portillo declined to discuss other evidence linking Jeffrey Peitz to his 
wife's death. Peitz, who was being held without bail, is scheduled to be 
arraigned today in Antelope Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Stuart, Peitz spoke warmly about his wife in the days after her death. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was probably the most well-liked person in the neighborhood," he told a 
reporter last week. She "would do anything for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Peitz, who works as a letter carrier, said he knew that sheriff's deputies 
believed he was involved in the killing. He alleged, however, that they merely 
wanted to make a quick arrest without a thorough investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the easiest target," he said. "They could make up any number of reasons 
. . . I am really the only witness, and also a real good suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Peitz said the slaying occurred while he was in an upstairs bedroom, folding 
clothes, and his wife was downstairs in a reclining chair, watching one of her 
favorite television shows, "Cops." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Peitz said he heard the shots, went downstairs "and saw a person at 
the screen door, at the front, leaving the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he owns a number of firearms, Peitz said he could not react more 
quickly that night because he had taken pain-killing medicine for a back 
problem. He said in an interview last week that he kept the firearms for 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Teri Lynn Peitz died at the scene of multiple gunshot wounds 
to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after the shooting, Peitz told reporters and friends that the 
evicted house squatter had killed his wife and that she had died because of her 
dedication to reducing crime in her east Palmdale neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 That effort began about 18 months ago, when Teri Lynn Peitz contacted Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Denham, who oversees Neighborhood Watch 
programs in the area, and asked him how to get an anti-crime group started. 
</P>
<P>
 "She went out and knocked on doors throughout her neighborhood and organized a 
program," Denham said. "It was one of the largest and one of the most active" 
Neighborhood Watch groups, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Denham said last week that he was unaware of any other Neighborhood Watch 
leaders being harmed because of their work. He also said that he was skeptical 
of Jeffrey Peitz's belief that his wife was killed because of her involvement 
in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Denham said he was not surprised by the husband's arrest. "This 
murder is a case of domestic violence," he said. "The Neighborhood Watch group 
will continue." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen Carr, a neighbor and close friend of the Peitzes, confirmed that she 
and other block captains were committed to continuing the Neighborhood Watch. 
She said group members want to distribute T-shirts bearing Teri Lynn Peitz's 
name as a tribute to their founder. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr also has set up a fund at Antelope Valley Bank's Palmdale branch to 
benefit the Peitzes' 16-year-old daughter Michelle, who is staying with 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr said that beyond her work with Neighborhood Watch, Teri Lynn Peitz was 
widely admired for her child-care business and for the Fourth of July picnics 
she organized for the neighborhood. The dead woman also had served as president 
of the Sumac School PTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr said that many of the family's friends are still stunned and puzzled by 
the recent slaying and arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it hard to believe that Jeff could kill Teri," Carr said. "In all of 
the years I've been good friends with them, Teri never complained about Jeff, 
and Jeff never showed any violence toward her. They were the center of the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, while Teri Peitz often listened to other people's problems, she 
rarely discussed her own, Carr said. The neighbor talked to Teri Peitz a few 
hours before the shooting and said her friend sounded depressed, but that she 
didn't say why. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Carr and other neighbors gathered around the Peitz house as 
investigators searched inside and told them authorities are confident they have 
arrested the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people here who do not believe Jeff could possibly have done it," 
Carr said. "I don't want to believe it. But sometimes when you see all the 
evidence in front of you . . . I find it hard to imagine that they would come 
in here and search the house so thoroughly and arrest a man for nothing."

PA ANNOUNCER GOES TO BAT IN PA.; SPORTS: BEHIND LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES 
MIKE, MERLE SANDERS ROOTS FOR NORTHRIDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As unabashedly excited as the youngsters on the playing field, 63-year-old 
Merle Sanders overlooked a cardinal rule before beginning his first game as 
official public address announcer Monday at the Little League World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 He forgot to use the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prayed the game wouldn't go into extra innings," said Sanders, a Mission 
Hills resident and Little League volunteer since the first of his four sons 
began to play in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't -- Chinese Taipei defeated Nova Scotia, Canada, 4 to 1 -- and 
Sanders was able to announce the following game in a more relaxed fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders can be excused the oversight. Like many others here, he has taken 
volunteerism to its pinnacle. 
</P>
<P>
 With no professional announcing experience and no formal training, in 1979 he 
began announcing games in the Mission Hills league. He moved up to the Western 
Regional in San Bernardino in 1981 and then, five years ago, began serving as 
assistant announcer of the Little League World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 He has never received a dime for his work and announcing is only part of that 
travail. Sanders' primary role in Little League: For 16 years, he has been 
administrator of District 40, which encompasses leagues from Woodland Hills to 
San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 District 40 also includes the Northridge Little League all-stars, who last 
week became the Western Regional champions and continued on to Williamsport and 
the World Series. It is the first time during Sanders' tenure as district 
administrator that a team in his purview has made it that far. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, Sanders has no conflict-of-interest problems in announcing the 
Northridge games because in Little League -- as in professional sports -- the 
public address announcer offers no commentary, simply announcing each player. 
He freely admits to being biased. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want Northridge to win, absolutely," said Sanders, whose wife, Sylvia, 
congratulates the Northridge families during games wearing a T-shirt that 
boasts that the team possesses "District 40 California Earthquake Power." 
</P>
<P>
 But to give Sanders time to root for the home team, his announcing of the 
Northridge games will be limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four games on each of the tournament's first three days, Sanders will 
announce just two, leaving Northridge games to his assistant. If the team 
advances to the national championship game on Thursday, Sanders would step back 
in front of the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 Public address announcing is drastically different than broadcasting: The PA 
announcer talks only to people in attendance -- not those watching on 
television -- and he does not describe the action. It does, however, have its 
own challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important aspect is to pronounce every boy's name correctly," said 
Sanders, who goes into the dugout before each game and asks each player to 
pronounce his own name. "If a boy's name is mispronounced, he cringes." 
</P>
<P>
 To the casual observer, the names of foreign players, especially those from 
Taipei playing Monday, would seem to be the most difficult. But Sanders says 
any name can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pitcher from Virginia's name is pronounced Wisher , but it is spelled 
W-E-I-S-H-A-R," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are surely thicker-skinned than the young players, umpires -- 
who come to the series from all over the world -- also deserve some name 
recognition, Sanders believes. The home plate umpire in Monday's second game 
said that Sanders was the first U.S. announcer to pronounce his name correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got it right, yes he did," said Wilfredo Alicea of Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders had a hard act to follow. Cliff Glier, who served as official 
announcer from 1968 until his death last year, became known as the "Voice of 
Little League Baseball" during his tenure. Dr. Creighton Hale, CEO of Little 
League Baseball Inc., knew he had to choose carefully because, after all, this 
is something of a lifetime appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, the job is Merle's for as long as he'd like it," 
Hale said. "He is a wonderful, wonderful person, very low-key and very 
dedicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders said that even though he had been Glier's assistant, he was still 
shocked when he opened a letter from Hale in June offering him the non-paying 
position. The post takes about one week's work a year and offers only one 
perquisite: As assistant, Sanders had to pay his own way; as top PA announcer, 
the expenses -- air fare, hotel and meals -- are on the house.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; PLAN MONKEYS WITH BOULEVARD REDESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Greg Nelson has his way, you might be spending your Saturday afternoons 
hanging out on a boulder, cafe latte in hand, in the cool shade of a tipu tree 
while admiring the view of elephants and the markedly reduced traffic in 
Tarzana along Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just one component of the Streetscapes project aimed at revamping Ventura 
Boulevard. Nelson, an architect who helped develop the proposed plan with other 
community leaders, says it would bring throngs of pedestrians to the 
boulevard's shops and eateries in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarzana residents will have an opportunity to view and comment on the plan at 
7 p.m. today, when the Tarzana Streetscape Committee holds a community meeting 
at the Tarzana Recreation Center, 5655 Vanalden Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The Streetscape panel is a subcommittee of the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan 
Review Board, which is holding similar meetings in communities from Woodland 
Hills to Studio City. Board members hope that, in this way, residents will be 
able to have a say in city planners' plans for landscaping Ventura Boulevard, a 
project expected to cost $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan for a pedestrian-friendly Tarzana borrows ideas from the highly 
successful Old Town Pasadena and Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, but 
with a definitive Tarzana twist. Because Tarzana was named after the 
vine-swinging Lord of the Apes created by one of the community's earlier 
residents, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Nelson believes the Tarzan connection is a 
"very sellable commodity." 
</P>
<P>
 Danton Burroughs, the novelist's grandson and a Ventura Boulevard businessman, 
is enthusiastic about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the idea of giving the community an interesting jungle image," said 
Burroughs, who would like to see full-grown trees planted around the 
neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 To produce a jungle-like atmosphere, Nelson suggested "putting sculptures of 
endangered species sporadically around" and placing metal silhouettes of 
monkeys in the trees. Nelson said he enjoys the idea of people, in making plans 
to rendezvous in Tarzana, saying to each other: "I'll meet you at the giraffe." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said he would like to see many artists participating in building these 
life-size animals. And to combat vandalism against these creatures, Nelson 
already has plans to have them built out of natural materials, which can be 
sandblasted clean if covered with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant boulders will replace park benches, according to Nelson, not only out of 
novelty, but because they will be difficult to sleep on.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's goofy," admits Nelson, "but it brings a smile to people's faces when 
they think about it." MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; RECALL GROUP ASKS D.A. TO PROBE FLYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of a movement to recall the Agoura Hills City Council have asked the 
district attorney to investigate whether the city broke the law by mailing 
flyers to residents explaining why the council passed a controversial utility 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's mailing of the flyers appears to have been an illegal use of 
taxpayers' money to prevent the recall, the group maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's true, it's illegal and it's wrong, and steps should be taken to make 
sure it never happens again," said Barbara Murphy, a leader of the recall 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "While city personnel maintain that this flyer was mailed to all residents . . 
. for information purposes, it was not sent out until the council was served 
with a notice of recall," wrote another group leader, John Sandberg Jr., in an 
Aug. 6 letter to the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials insist they mailed the flyer to keep residents abreast of the 
city's fiscal situation and not to stop the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall group, Citizens Against New Local Taxes, will hold a petition drive 
Saturday, Murphy said. The drive will be from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the 
intersection of Kanan Road and Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 If citizens can collect 2,454 signatures -- 20% of the city's 12,026 
registered voters -- by Dec. 7, the council would then be required to hold a 
recall election, City Clerk Pat Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group filed its notice of intent to recall July 14 with the city clerk, 
after the council voted unanimously the day before to pass a 4% tax on 
electricity, gas and telephone service to help close a budget deficit of nearly 
$1 million. The recall group says the city did not need the utility tax, but 
the city says it had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office, said the office routinely neither confirms nor denies matters involving 
special investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ed Corridori, who was named in Sandberg's letter along with 
Councilwoman Louise Rishoff -- as being behind the plan to mail the flyers, 
said the decision was not linked to the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something we had talked about and decided to do long before we were 
served with any notice of recall," Corridori said. "I don't know what else to 
say about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanette Turvill, a spokeswoman for the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission, said Monday that according to state law, "no public officer shall 
expend, no candidate shall receive public monies for the purpose of seeking 
elective office." 
</P>
<P>
 Recall elections, she said, are considered ballot initiatives, "not elections 
for candidacy." 
</P>
<P>
 State law also prohibits mass mailings of 200 or more pieces of mail that 
feature an elected officer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this particular flyer did not feature a public official, that might not 
necessarily butt up against the mass-mailing provisions," she said. FRANK

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; MAN GETS 8 YEARS FOR ROLE IN AUTO THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Pacoima man was sentenced to eight years in prison Monday after pleading no 
contest to charges stemming from his role in helping another man steal a car 
from a parking lot at El Camino Real High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Johnson, 29, pleaded no contest to aiding a felony and unlawfully 
driving a vehicle without permission, Deputy Dist. Atty.Mitchel J. Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson immediately was sentenced by Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael R. 
Hoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-defendant Leon Blunt, 37, of Los Angeles, is scheduled to go on trial 
Wednesday. He is charged with assault with a deadly weapon for allegedly 
attempting to run down school security guard Aaron Mengazzi, who shot him in 
the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Harris said the incident occurred shortly before 11 a.m. on March 
9, when two students saw a man trying to break into a friend's car and called 
the school police. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson already had left -- in the stolen car they'd driven to the school -- 
and Blunt allegedly was trying to drive the student's car away when Mengazzi 
stepped in front of him, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mengazzi told police he fired his gun when the suspect bore down on him in the 
car. Blunt then allegedly crashed the car into a barrier. ANN O'NEILL

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; AT-RISK YOUTHS LEARN THE ROPES OF COOPERATION 
</P>

 "Jump at it and you'll miss it," warned outdoor instructor Sam Douglas to a 
young man standing atop a 60-foot pole trying to muster up the courage to leap 
onto a trapeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jump above it!" Douglas yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 The young man glanced down at another youth who was "belaying" him (holding 
onto the harness and ropes to keep him from falling). Then he jumped and 
grabbed the trapeze bar successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 The jumper and his partner are participants in the new Say Yes to Experience 
program at Camp David Gonzales, a probation facility for juvenile offenders in 
the Santa Monica Mountains near Calabasas. The camp is often the last chance 
before prison for many of the youths. 
</P>
<P>
 On the camp's intensive course, the youths, often members of rival gangs, 
learn physical skills as well as trust and cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no failure here," said Douglas, coordinator of the ropes program, 
the first of its kind in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas said he encourages the youths to participate in whatever capacity they 
feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the kids who are usually sitting in the back of the class. . . . 
But we don't want them to do that here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas gently coaxes reluctant youths at the camp to gear up and learn to 
rappel themselves from poles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary," said Dwight, a member of the Crips. "It's so high." Dwight said 
the ropes course has enabled him to put his life in the hands of members of the 
rival Bloods. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen-year-old Mario said when he first got to Camp Gonzales, he would get 
into fights with other gang members. But during a trust- and teamwork-building 
exercise in which 20 people have to cross a log together from opposite 
directions without falling off, he found he had to grab the hands of a boy he 
had once fought to get to the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like making a peace treaty," Mario said. MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; GOLF COURSE GETS TENTATIVE OK ON PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER

<TEXT>
<P>
 To the delight and applause of a hearing room full of golfers Monday, a city 
zoning official said he planned to approve a permit for the continued operation 
of the Studio City Golf Course -- but only after consulting with the city 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it has been a good use for the community," said Horace Tramel, 
associate zoning administrator. He added, however, that questions over the 
course's application for a conditional-use permit warranted legal review, "and 
I am not an attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon hearing at the Sherman Oaks Woman's Club pitted the Weddington 
Investment Partnership, which owns the land, against the operators of the 
course. The course is seeking to stay in business, and the partnership wants to 
sell the plot or lease it at a higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
 As the hearing got under way, the overflow audience of primarily retiree 
golfers quickly painted the partnership as a stingy business out to take away 
their golf in the interest of profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about money!" one woman shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 The partners discovered this spring that the course's conditional-use permit 
expired more than nine years ago. They contend that the expiration nullifies 
the course's lease -- which was first signed in 1955 and brings them a mere 
$1,000 a month on the 17.2 acres of prime urban property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just asking for a fair price," said Mort Allen, a Studio City realtor 
representing the partnership. He added that the partnership was not seeking to 
develop the lot, but rather renegotiate its lease with Studio City Golf Course 
or bring in a new operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Morris, a private planning consultant working for the golf course, said 
allowing the original permit to expire was simply an "oversight." 
</P>
<P>
 The course had received approval for such permits from the 1950s through the 
1970s, he said, and since nothing had substantially changed at the course since 
the last application in 1975, there was no reason to deny granting a new one.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've had over 2,700 people say, 'We like it just the way it is -- leave it 
alone,' " Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate Zoning Administrator Tramel agreed that the golf course had proven 
itself a good neighbor, and the primary sticking point becomes whether course 
operators have the right even to apply for a new permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing city ordinances, partnership attorney Bob Smith said only an owner or 
lessee may apply for a conditional-use permit. And, he contended, according to 
the lease agreement, the golf course ceased to be the lessee on May 1, 1985, 
when the previous permit expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he releases his recommendation, Tramel said, the city attorney's office 
will look at that charge, as well as allegations that not all neighbors within 
500 feet of the course were notified 24 days before Monday's hearing, as 
required by law. Either side can appeal Tramel's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of the outcome regarding the permit, the fight over the precise 
meaning of the original lease is likely to wind up in court.  
</P>
<P>
 While the crowd Monday was distinctly one-sided, supporting the golf course 
with cheers and hammering the Weddington Partnership with boos, Gail Becker, 
who lives near the green swath, said there were indeed two sides to this story. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that she'd be angry if she were the owner and only getting $1,000 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if they raise the rent . . . just as long as it remains a golf 
course. L.A. city owes the people some things of beauty." ERIC SLATER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PIERCE HEAD PITCHES COMMERCIAL PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierce College's president -- seeking support for her ambitious plans to 
renovate the campus and introduce various commercial ventures -- has begun 
pitching her proposals to neighborhood residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to know where you are going if you are ever going to get there," 
said Mary Lee, who estimates the project will cost up to $100 million and take 
as long as three years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial ventures, including a golf driving range, will bring in badly 
needed revenues with minimal impact to the neighborhood, said Lee. Most of the 
proposals are designed to improve the school's educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 She will meet at 7:30 p.m. Thursday with members of the Woodland Hills 
Homeowners Organization at the Pacific Lodge Boy's Home, 49000 Serrania Ave. in 
West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's proposal includes creating a public/private partnership to build a 
driving range and farm museum; construction of a 300-seat domed theater that 
would also serve as a planetarium; construction of a discovery pavilion to give 
children and adults hands-on experience in science; construction of a 160- to 
260-seat conference center, and adding about 10,000 seats to the football 
stadium, which now holds about 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would be paid for, Lee said, through state grants, public/private 
partnerships and special assessment districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Many neighborhood residents want to learn more about Lee's ideas, said Robert 
Gross, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have some skepticism over the master plan," he said. "How does it enter 
into the educational mission of a college?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main goals are to make sure that the farmland and the natural environment 
areas be protected for educational use and for wildlife habitat," said Margo 
Murman, president of the Coalition to Save the Farm, a group formed to spare 
the farm from budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I've seen of the plan, it keeps evolving," she added. "I certainly 
would like to see a lot of public input." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Lee's proposals, the farm would remain in operation and a 15-acre 
wildlife preserve, Canyon de Lana, would not be altered. Lee says she has 
consulted with students, teachers, school administrators and others about her 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood group has been at odds with previous school officials, 
including Dan Means, who retired as president in June, 1991, after leading a 
successful bid to close the school's dairy and farm store. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gross, Lee -- who took over as president in April after serving 
13 years as president of Valley College -- has been working with residents to 
ease tension. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a proven educational leader in Mary Lee and we are looking forward to 
working with her," Gross said. FRANK MANNING

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; DISABLED TO WORK AT REOPENED MOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An abandoned Van Nuys motel where police say prostitutes once plied their 
trade will be reopened to provide a different type of service: training people 
with disabilities for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, neighbors complained that the 46-unit Chateau Motel on Sepulveda 
Boulevard was a magnet for prostitutes and drug dealers, prompting city zoning 
officials in March to threaten to close the inn if it was not cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 Closed in April by its owners, the motel is getting a second life, thanks to 
Dennis Catron. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan to open up as a family motel," said Catron, board president of Asian 
Pacific Community Services, a nonprofit group based in Westminster. "We want to 
use it as a training center to get people with disabilities into the motel 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen trainees will serve as maids, desk clerks and maintenance 
workers at the inn, in the 6700 block of Sepulveda Boulevard. Counselors who 
provide the free training will also work at the motel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea of reopening the motel, for whatever purpose, drew some concerns 
from neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing something for the handicapped and getting them back to work sounds like 
a nice thing to do," said Jeff Ross, owner of Jeff's Lock and Key, across the 
street from the motel. "But time will tell. History shows that we have had 
problems with that motel." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the motel was one of five on Sepulveda Boulevard that was branded a 
magnet for petty crime by the city, prompting officials to set more than two 
dozen operating conditions against the owners, identified by city records as 
Jin Chan Yang and Guey Dan Hwu. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the other four motels appealed the decision, the Chateau owners did 
not. The motel has been closed since April, when a chain-link fence was erected 
and the windows were boarded up. 
</P>
<P>
 Catron said his agency, which acquired the lease on the motel after the bank 
foreclosed on the owners, will follow the conditions set forth by the city, 
including hiring a security guard, adding security cameras and improving 
lighting. The agency will also meet with neighbors to ensure their satisfaction 
with the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The city must also approve any blueprint changes for the motel before it can 
reopen, Catron said. The facility will also include office space for the 
agency, whose Van Nuys branch was condemned after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take at least two months and $50,000 to rehabilitate the property, 
Catron said. The costs include replacing stolen televisions and air 
conditioners, converting a fire-damaged room into a storage shed, and clearing 
the weed-choked entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an eyesore to the neighborhood," Catron said. At the same time, he 
said he hopes the new motel opens the community's eyes to the abilities of the 
disabled. "People with disabilities have a lot to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 Although this is the agency's first attempt to manage a motel, Catron said it 
has operated retail and other businesses to train and place more than 3,000 
people with disabilities in jobs since 1982. JEFF SCHNAUFER

HILLSIDE HOMES TO UNDERGO QUAKE STUDY; RECOVERY: INSPECTIONS MAY CALL FOR CODE 
REVISIONS AND RETROFITTING, AS STRUCTURES ON SLOPES WARRANT SPECIAL ATTENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A team of engineers and city building inspectors will start looking at scores 
of hillside homes above the San Fernando Valley this week and next in an effort 
to analyze the varying degrees of damage the buildings suffered in the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's conclusions will probably result in revisions to the city building 
code, including possible retrofitting requirements for existing hillside 
houses, a department spokesman said. The code's current seismic-safety 
requirements are the same for structures on flat land and hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at common factors in the failure or damage that these buildings 
sustained," said Nicholas Delli Quadri, a senior structural engineer at the Los 
Angeles Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be maintenance problems, it may be lack of (building frame) connectors 
that should've been there, it could be anything. . . . Based on that 
information will come back recommendations on what to change in the code," 
Delli Quadri said. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called subcommittee on hillside dwellings has compiled a list of 378 
single-family homes on the Valley side of the Santa Monica Mountains between 
Studio City and Woodland Hills. Some sustained 25% damage and were green-tagged 
or deemed safe to occupy, and others were yellow- or red-tagged. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unlikely the subcommittee will visit all the homes, Delli Quadri said. 
But the visiting group of engineers and inspectors hopes to sample enough to 
make comparisons, especially between similarly designed structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The list includes six homes on Sherwood Place, where quake victims Marc Yobs 
and Karen Osterholt lived, all of them on the down-slope side of the street, 
Delli Quadri said. (Yobs and Osterholt's home is not listed among the six, 
probably because it was demolished, Delli Quadri said.) 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and private engineers have been studying earthquake damage for 
months in an attempt to learn from the 6.8-magnitude temblor and revise the 
city building code. But the subcommittee on hillside dwellings was only 
recently formed, at the suggestion of a Northern California engineer who was 
already serving on post-quake committee and felt they warranted special 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 In a phone interview Monday, engineer James Russell said that on a flat lot a 
building's side walls are rectangular in shape, while those on a hillside are 
triangular. "That shape difference means the (earthquake) forces are acting 
differently, and that's a situation that needs to be resolved," said Russell, 
who is based in Concord, Calif., and heads a statewide committee on residential 
retrofitting for the California Building Officials Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Three people were killed in the collapse of hillside homes during the Jan. 17 
quake, according to the county coroner's office. In addition to Yobs and 
Osterholt, they included 5-year-old Amy Vigil-Tyre, whose family also lived in 
Sherman Oaks. LESLIE BERGER

MAN WHO SEXUALLY ANNOYED BABY-SITTER SENTENCED; CRIME: STEVEN KLEIN, WHO ALSO 
MADE EXPLICIT TELEPHONE CALLS TO HIS FORMER GIRLFRIEND, GETS 16 MONTHS IN JAIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 40-year-old Woodland Hills man was sentenced Monday to 16 months in jail for 
sexually annoying a 14-year-old baby-sitter and for making annoying telephone 
calls to his former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Municipal Court Judge Gregg Marcus sentenced Steven Klein, who 
pleaded no contest to a single charge of child-annoying in connection with the 
baby-sitter and four counts of making annoying calls to the former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge found that Klein violated his probation on a 1993 conviction for 
making sexually explicit telephone calls to a female friend of his former wife. 
He also was convicted in 1992 of lewd conduct for exposing himself to a group 
of schoolchildren, according to Deputy City Atty. Charles Aguado. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus also placed Klein on three years probation, ordered him to register as 
a sex offender and to undergo psychiatric counseling. He is prohibited from 
associating with children under age 14 and was ordered to stay away from the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident involving the baby-sitter occurred March 15, when he asked her to 
watch his roommate's two sons, ages 4 and 7. The baby-sitter told police that 
Klein made sexual advances to her, appeared before her nude, and ordered her to 
get into a bathtub. She refused. 
</P>
<P>
 The four phone charges involve Klein's alleged harassment of a former 
girlfriend who blocked him from moving into her Encino apartment complex after 
she kicked him out of her unit. The calls, as many as 30 a day and often 
sexually explicit, occurred between late 1992 and last June, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 lewd conduct conviction arose from an incident on Dec. 10, 1991, when 
he exposed himself from a Van Nuys apartment balcony to children in a 
playground across the street, prosecutors said.

LOCKHEED CAN SEND FUMES FROM TOXIC SOIL INTO AIR; ENVIRONMENT: DEFENSE FIRM 
GETS AQMD PERMISSION AS PART OF SUPERFUND CLEANUP. RELEASE OF POTENTIAL 
CARCINOGENS SOWS ANGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regional air pollution control officials have given the Lockheed Corp. 
permission to pump up to 44 pounds a day of vapors containing potentially 
cancer-causing substances into the air as part of the massive Superfund effort 
to clean up contaminated soil, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense firm has been granted preliminary approval by the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District to operate about 200 wells next year that will 
remove volatile organic compounds from contaminated soil and release them into 
the atmosphere. The project is aimed at meeting federal Environmental 
Protection Agency orders to remove the contaminants before they poison 
underground water sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed "vapor extraction system," as it is known, will "employ the best 
available control technology for controlling air pollution" and there is less 
than one chance in 100,000 that anyone would actually develop cancer from 
breathing the exposed air, according to the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, it has raised the ire of nearby residents who worry about the 
potential health risks and a drop in their property values. Some have asked how 
carcinogens could be any safer in the air than in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Iverson, 76, lives across the street from a vacant lot at 1705 Victory 
Place, where Lockheed's former B-1 plant was situated and where the proposed 
system will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're quite perturbed by not knowing how safe this thing is and how long it 
will last," he said. "Nobody told us it was contaminated soil. . . . You can 
hardly sell a house here now because no one wants to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 angry residents who held a meeting during the weekend to stop the 
project are thinking of taking their complaints to the Burbank City Council 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if council members wanted to side with residents, Burbank Mayor Bill 
Wiggins said there is little city officials can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is the city has no jurisdiction over this because it's 
an issue between Lockheed and the AQMD," Wiggins said, adding that he would 
like Lockheed to release a detailed description of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials said the issue is being left to the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the AQMD notified residents near the B-1 plant of its 
intention to issue Lockheed a permit to operate the wells. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason given by the agency for doing so was that the project complies with 
regulations governing air pollution control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years, things have gotten spilled into the ground and we now have 
this, for a lack of a better term, toxic waste dump," said Bill Milner, an AQMD 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing is done, he said, "there's going to be a greater long-term health 
risk" from contaminated water. "That's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 According to an AQMD analysis, chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride, 
chloroform, methylene chloride and trichloroethylene used to de-grease airplane 
parts before painting them have seeped into the ground under the former B-1 
plant site. 
</P>
<P>
 One goal of the proposed system, Lockheed officials say, is to stop solvents 
in the soil from reaching the already tainted ground water that has shut down 
Burbank's municipal water wells. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing everything we can to meet the requirements of the (AQMD)," said 
Lockheed spokesman Keith Mordoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD estimates that the project will cost about $13 million, but Lockheed 
officials could not confirm that figure Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 With a vapor extraction system, newly built wells would extract vapors from 
the contaminated soil and filter them through a controlling system. 
</P>
<P>
 For every 100 pounds of vapor extracted, Milner said, two pounds will be 
released into the air from a 50-foot tower while the rest will be piped into a 
storage tank for disposal at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the system can be put in place, however, Lockheed must present its 
proposal to the Burbank Planning Board to obtain a conditional-use permit to 
operate the tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the tension between some homeowners and project officials, other 
residents near the vacant lot remain unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many carcinogens in the air we breath and, yes, in the water we 
don't drink," said Noel Hobson, 53, a graphic designer living a few blocks 
away.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; AIDS RESEARCH PIONEER GOTTLIEB OFFERS PATIENCE AND CONFIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a greater awareness of the killer disease known as AIDS since it was 
discovered in 1981, but the number of people infected with the virus that 
causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome continues to grow. According to the 
World Health Organization, in the last 12 months 3 million more people 
worldwide have become infected with HIV. To date, more than 17 million people 
are infected, setting a pace for as many as 40 million by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, at the 10th annual International AIDS Conference in 
Yokohama, Japan, many scientists used the word "crisis" to describe the state 
of AIDS research. Many researchers have concluded that 10 years after finding 
the "bug" that causes AIDS -- but no cure -- it is time to put more emphasis on 
basic research. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials have announced plans to revamp the $1.3-billion annual AIDS 
budget to devote more time to laboratory studies and less to clinical research 
to test new treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there has been some progress. The drug AZT has been found to reduce the 
transmission of HIV from infected mothers to their children by two-thirds. 
Antiviral drugs called protease inhibitors have also been found to block an 
enzyme that is intimately linked to viral replication. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Michael S. Gottlieb, who reported the first known cases of AIDS in 1981, 
remains optimistic that progress has been made and will continue to be made in 
the fight against AIDS. Gottlieb, who has offices in Sherman Oaks, Pasadena and 
Century City, spoke with Times staff writer Julio Moran.

<P>
 Question: Do you think that some scientists have concluded that we are back to 
square one in AIDS research because 10 years later we still do not have a 
vaccine for HIV?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think that people are frustrated and disappointed, and it is natural 
for them to feel that way. After all, 250,000 people in the United States have 
died of AIDS; 150,000 people today in the U.S. are living with AIDS. Another 
100,000 test positive for HIV every year. I think people care a lot more today 
about better treatments because they know or have known people with AIDS. 
People are frightened and frustrated and disappointed and expect faster 
progress. But in medical research, 10 to 15 years is a relatively short time 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So you personally are not surprised that there have not been more 
developments in AIDS research?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, there have been a lot of developments. None have been home runs. On the 
other hand, it hasn't been a no-hitter. Even at the Japan conference there were 
a number of developments that could be called singles or even doubles. The 
ability of AZT to cut down on the transmission of HIV from mother to baby is a 
very significant development. It raises a whole lot of additional ethical 
questions about the lack of availability of AZT in many countries around the 
world where mother-to-child transmissions are occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a purely medical level, our ability to affect something as important as 
mother-to-child transmission, while admittedly a very focused and limited 
application of technology, to me it is an indicator that we are not at a 
research standstill. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has research up to now been limited to finding a vaccine, or is that merely 
a public misperception?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it is natural for people to anticipate something dramatic like the 
Salk vaccine for polio, which was a very dramatic event in world history. That 
event has set up an expectation which in this case hasn't been fulfilled 
because the virus has been so elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: More elusive that when you first saw the disease in 1981?  
</P>
<P>
 A: When the virus was first described, we did not appreciate just how complex 
and evasive and formidable it was. With every year, the new information we have 
gathered about it continues to add to its reputation as a bad actor. We did not 
anticipate how tough and adaptable HIV is. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see the Japan conference as a starting-over point?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There is some of that, and I think that's healthy in any endeavor, 
especially science, to revamp a strategic plan. I don't entirely agree with the 
new strategy of the Office of AIDS Research to put a much greater emphasis on 
basic biology research, in some cases on viruses other than HIV, in order to 
try to understand HIV much better. The study of other viruses is important, but 
HIV is the one that should be most intensely under the microscope. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm also concerned that the strategy is a reversion to the business-as-usual 
modus operandi of the National Institutes of Health before HIV. It is based on 
the idea in science that breakthroughs come about when scientists are totally 
free to choose what to work on without being directed to work on specific 
problems by someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You don't agree with that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In principle I agree. However, when it comes to a global emergency that 
threatens the survival of the species, I favor a more focused approach. It may 
not require bringing together scientists from all over the country to a Los 
Alamos, but I support scientists working together in a more focused, 
goal-oriented way on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have there been factors that have hampered finding an HIV vaccine by now?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The absence of a good animal model has been a very big issue. HIV has a 
preference for human beings. It has very specifically evolved to become a 
parasite of humans. There are related viruses with some similarities, but 
specifically vaccine trials for HIV must be tested on an animal that is 
susceptible to HIV. That's why there are so many ethical dilemmas about HIV 
vaccine trials because the human being is the most suitable experimental 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think the public still believes that AIDS is only a gay disease?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think there is still some of that. But most people becoming infected with 
HIV outside Western Europe and the United States are not gay men. By the year 
2000, the gender difference will disappear worldwide. In this country, in the 
last 18 months 8% of new cases reported were heterosexuals who acquired HIV 
through sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think that the growing number of women with HIV will bring more 
attention for AIDS?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Women with HIV are becoming more organized and vocal with respect to needs 
for services for themselves and their children. They have become more 
politically active. That seems to be taking off around the globe. That is a 
very welcome development. A lot of the spread of HIV around the world has to do 
with the second-class citizenship of women. In many countries, woman are 
treated as property and have very little choice in deciding whether they have 
sex or not, and whether their partner uses a condom. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you surprised that the number of people infected with HIV continues to 
grow?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It has grown in relationship to poverty and prostitution and apathy. And 
it's growing because we are late in getting serious about curbing it. For 
example, given the social mores in Thailand, it was highly predictable it would 
become a hot spot. Yet, preventive efforts were insufficiently intensive to 
prevent a catastrophe. On another level, it relates to HIV itself. Just as it 
exploits weaknesses of the immune system, its spread globally depends on 
weaknesses in social structures and human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some people have compared HIV to cancer, in that both are fatal and a 
vaccine has not been found for either one. Is that a fair comparison?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it is a little unfair to compare the two. Most cancers do not have 
anything as specific as a virus as the cause. HIV depletes the immune cells, 
where you usually think of cancer as a multiplication of cells. Since we know 
that HIV is the instigator, we have a leg up in finding an effective therapy. I 
believe that we have a better chance of finding treatments for HIV than in the 
case of cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about your patients? Has their outlook changed in the last 14 years?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I've seen it go from hopelessness to hope, and now hopelessness again. A 
misreading of the current state of care is leading to hopelessness. We have 
news reports that reinforce to a person that they are going to die from HIV. 
Doctors are seeing a relapse toward quackery and therapies that offer false 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see an increase in HIV patients turning away from traditional 
doctors?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Patients always have sought alternative therapy. I think now there is more 
disenchantment with the approved antiviral drugs and a misreading of the new 
information coming out of the international meeting in Yokohama. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So some of your treatment is not just for the body, but for the mind?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Sometimes I do feel like a cheerleader. For patients to come away from a 
conference resigned to the fact that there is no hope is very damaging. 
</P>
<P>
 But to say we are back to square one -- that we have made no progress and that 
research is at a standstill, or that the problems are insurmountable or that we 
will never solve these problems -- is just plain wrong.

MAN JAILED FOR LEWD PHOTOGRAPHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acknowledging that using a hand-held mirror to take photos up strange women's 
dresses at a shopping mall was "a stupid thing to do," a West Hills man began 
serving a 10-day jail sentence Monday for doing just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Chavarria, a 29-year-old secretary, also was placed on two years' 
probation and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service, said Deputy 
City Atty.Kenneth Tso. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Municipal Court Judge Michael E. Knight also ordered the film in 
Chavarria's camera destroyed and told him to stay away from the Topanga Plaza 
Mall in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavarria was taken into custody Saturday after two women complained to police 
that he'd approached them from behind, pointed the mirror up their skirts and 
taken pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just bent down and -- snap, snap!" Tso said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incidents occurred in two stores in the mall -- a Hallmark store and a 
candle shop called Wicks N Sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 The first victim, a 21-year-old Los Angeles woman, was unaware that she'd been 
photographed until another shopper told her, authorities said. She and the 
shopper followed Chavarria to another store, where they watched him photograph 
the second young woman. Mall guards were called, the women made a citizen's 
arrest and the first victim identified Chavarria for police. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavarria admitted he'd taken pictures by aiming his mirror up women's 
dresses, Tso said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it was a stupid thing to do," Chavarria told police. "My friend does 
it, so I decided I would try it." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ordered Chavarria to begin serving the jail sentence immediately and 
said he could fulfill his community service requirement by removing graffiti or 
working on a Caltrans road crew.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; JOY RIDER TARGETS HEAVY EQUIPMENT; CRIME: 
SEVERAL CONSTRUCTION SITES HAVE BEEN VANDALIZED. WORKERS SAY ONE BREAK-IN 
NEARLY CAUSED AN OIL SPILL. 
</P>

<P>
 A trespasser in tennis shoes has been taking heavy equipment for joy rides at 
local construction sites but there are no smiles from workers, who say that at 
least one break-in nearly caused a severe oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
 The incidents have occurred over the past few weeks at several Santa Clarita 
Valley construction sites, according to a report by Deputy Scott Gibson of the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Santa Clarita Valley Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage from some of the joy rides has been relatively minor. Two carob 
trees worth $3,050 were damaged by one of two cranes driven last week around a 
Newhall Land & Farming Co. field west of the intersection of the Old Road and 
Valencia Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 But another incident in the same field had the potential to cause more serious 
damage. A backhoe was driven into a canyon where an 8-foot hole was dug near a 
large oil pipeline, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hole which they dug was only about 20 feet away from the Mobil Oil 
pipeline which, if they would have ruptured, would have caused a catastrophic 
oil spill," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In both incidents, the heavy equipment was returned, Gibson said. The suspect 
or suspects apparently hot-wired the cranes and the backhoe or used a hidden 
key to start them. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Stats, co-owner of Stats Construction, told deputies that matching 
tennis shoe prints were found around heavy equipment kept in the field after 
both incidents.  
</P>
<P>
 Similar shoe prints have been found near equipment operated illegally at other 
sites, authorities said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 INJURED IN FORCED COPTER LANDING

<P>
 A National Guard helicopter that had been on display at the Van Nuys Air Show 
during the weekend was forced to make an emergency landing Monday during a 
flight to its base in Stockton, injuring two crewmen. 
</P>
<P>
 The chopper landed hard about 11:30 a.m. in a farm field south of Quail Lake 
Road and west of the Golden State Freeway, said Sgt. John Ashley of the Santa 
Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot of the AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter noticed an engine warning light, 
said a sergeant at National Guard headquarters in Sacramento. "They were going 
to set it down to see what the problem was when the engine quit," he said, and 
the pilot made an emergency landing by "counter-rotating" -- using the drag of 
free-spinning rotor blades to slow its descent and keep it upright. 
</P>
<P>
 The two crewmen were treated for spinal injuries at Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita. One was released and the other was in good 
condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter suffered landing gear damage and will have to be disassembled 
and trucked back to Stockton, the sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
 More coverage of the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys appears today on B14.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CHARGES WON'T BE FILED IN YOUTH'S SHOOTING; 
ACTON: THE WHEELCHAIR-BOUND MAN FIRED AT 2 TEEN-AGERS TAMPERING WITH HIS CAR, 
KILLING A THIRD BOY HE DIDN'T SEE.

<P>
 A wheelchair-bound Acton man who fatally shot one of three 14-year-old boys 
who were trying to steal a car from the man's ranch will face no criminal 
charges, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Malcom McWilliams, 52, fired a warning shot Thursday night from his porch at 
two youths he saw tampering with the car, killing a third teen-ager he did not 
see, said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Myron Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins said the youths had also tried to steal the car the previous day and 
apparently knew McWilliams was handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a person paralyzed from the waist down in a wheelchair and all 
alone," he said. "You have to take that into consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams told sheriff's investigators that he intended to give the youths a 
lecture about joy-riding, using a June 1 incident involving his granddaughters 
as an example. The girls were joy-riding June 1 when their car collided head-on 
with a second vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 One of McWilliams' granddaughters, JoKema Du Bois, 15, was killed. Her sister, 
Barbara, 14, was seriously injured and is expected to be mentally and 
physically impaired for life. Two other girls were killed in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's shooting, a bullet from McWilliams' .30-30 carbine went through 
a rusted-out Pontiac Firebird, striking and killing Ernesto Pedraza, 14, of 
Apple Valley. Jenkins said Pedraza was hiding behind the Firebird after 
crawling out of a Chevrolet Chevette he was trying to start. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedraza's family could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies arrested McWilliams on suspicion of involuntary 
manslaughter, but described him as "very cooperative" and "very upset."  
</P>
<P>
 Friends of McWilliams said he is normally jovial, but that the accident 
involving his granddaughters had left him despondent and that the shooting had 
made him suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins said there was no evidence to support felony charges such as murder or 
recklessly discharging a firearm against McWilliams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fired away from where he thought they were stealing his car," Jenkins 
said. "He didn't fire over their heads because there was a campground next 
door." 
</P>
<P>
 Involuntary manslaughter charges were rejected because there was nothing to 
suggest McWilliams acted recklessly, Jenkins added. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just didn't point a gun out the window and fire without knowing where he 
was pointing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams was released from custody Monday afternoon, Jenkins said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY SEEKS TO JOIN PROGRAM TO REWARD 
COMMERCIAL RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials here hope to join 29 other cities in a statewide program that offers 
low-interest loans and quicker permit approval to local businesses for using 
recycled materials in their manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old program administered by the California Integrated Waste 
Management Board tries to create new markets for recycled goods while expanding 
manufacturing operations in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Californians need to get in the habit of buying products manufactured with 
recycled materials," said board Chairman Jesse Huff. 
</P>
<P>
 The program began in 1992. It is the first and possibly the only one of its 
kind in the country, said Liza Smith, a spokeswoman for the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29 California cities have received a Recycling Market Development Zone 
designation. Companies in those designated geographic areas may seek technical, 
marketing or financial assistance from the state board, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businesses that locate in these zones may be eligible for low-interest loans 
from the board of up to $1 million," said Huff, adding that about $7.7 million 
in loans have been approved since the first loan was issued more than a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 About $6 million in loans has been available in 1994 to qualifying firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita officials hope to receive state board approval in the next six 
months. Once approved, a recycling incentive zone stays in effect for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Santa Clarita businesses receiving loans through the board, the 
program will help the city meet the requirements of Assembly Bill 939, which 
requires cities and counties statewide to reduce trash 25% by 1995 and 50% by 
the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's healthy for 939 and healthy for the environment here," said 
Jeff Kolin, Santa Clarita's director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cities with designated recycling zones have attracted manufacturing 
businesses by touting the program's incentives, Kolin said. Santa Clarita has 
an economic development program to lure desirable businesses but has not yet 
identified companies that could benefit from the program. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the approval process, the state board considers what potentially 
recyclable materials are being regularly thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
 Yard waste, which can be used for composting in parks or for agricultural 
businesses, and metals or plastics, which can be used for furniture, are now 
discarded regularly in Santa Clarita, Kolin said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 4 DIE IN WEEKEND TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS IN THE 
ANTELOPE VALLEY

 Four people were killed in three Antelope Valley traffic accidents over the 
weekend, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first occurred in Palmdale at about 11:40 a.m. Saturday. Mario Flores, 45, 
of Littlerock was driving south on 106th Street East when he allegedly ran a 
stop sign at Avenue T and collided with an eastbound Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
 Caroline Baker, 87, and Lincoln Bohm, 93, both of Newhall, passengers in the 
Cadillac, died later that day at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center from injuries 
sustained in the collision. Driver William O'Neill, 70, of Helendale was 
hospitalized with moderate injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, who was driving despite having a suspended license, was arrested on 
suspicion of felony hit-and-run and manslaughter, California Highway Patrol 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second accident at about 8 a.m. Sunday, Herman St. Aimie, 28, of Los 
Angeles apparently fell asleep at the wheel of his Jeep Wrangler as he drove 
west along Avenue K in Lancaster, authorities said. The vehicle drifted onto 
the road's dirt shoulder of the road, striking and killing a pedestrian, Walter 
Crocker, 69, of Lancaster, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Aimie told authorities he was unaware that he had hit anyone. He was 
arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Sunday, also in Palmdale, a collision occurred at the intersection of 
Sierra Highway and Avenue P in Palmdale when Jesus Hernandez, 22, of Palmdale 
allegedly drove his Volkswagen Rabbit through a red light, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Volkswagen struck a southbound Ford Explorer, which had a green arrow and 
was turning east onto Avenue P. The Volkswagen then spun out of control and 
struck a Pontiac Grand Prix that was westbound on Avenue P and turning north 
onto Sierra Highway, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Passenger Toni Frederico, 13, was killed. She was ejected from the 
Volkswagen's rear window, landed under the Pontiac and was dragged 40 feet, 
according to Sheriff's Deputy Dave Davidson. Hernandez was taken to Palmdale 
Hospital Medical Center, where he is listed in critical condition. Neither was 
wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sisters Heather Miller, 14, and Leann Miller(, 15, were also in the Volkswagen 
and suffered cuts and bruises, Davidson said. Both were wearing seat belts and 
are listed in fair condition at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale residents Judy Lamar, 44, who was driving the Ford and Edward 
Esteavan, 33, who was driving the Pontiac, sustained minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred at about 7:20 p.m. Hernandez is suspected of driving 
under the influence of alcohol and faces arrest on a felony manslaughter 
charge, Davidson said.

LOCKHEED, NORTHROP HOPE FOR BEST IN FACE OF CUTS; DEFENSE: PROGRAM THAT EMPLOYS

 Officials at Lockheed Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp. braced for the worst 
but hoped for the best Monday after the Pentagon said some of their most 
lucrative projects could be delayed or cut back as the result of worsening 
budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 10 major weapons programs -- including the Air Force's proposed 
$71.6-billion F-22 jet fighter program, in which Lockheed is the lead 
contractor -- have been targeted to make up for a budget shortfall, according 
to a memorandum the Pentagon released Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the memo, Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch told the Air Force that 
it should prepare for a four-year delay in production of the F-22 Stealth 
fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo also said an attack missile program that employs about 1,700 Northrop 
workers in Hawthorne could be scuttled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been formally contacted by the Defense Department yet," said Tony 
Cantafio, a spokesman for Los Angeles-based Northrop. "All we can do is wait 
and see what happens next." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than a few managers, Calabasas-based Lockheed has yet to hire anyone in 
Southern California to work on its F-22 program because the plane is still in 
its developmental stages, a Lockheed spokesman said. However, the company's 
fabled Skunk Works plant in Palmdale is expected to make many of the jet's 
components for the plane's eventual assembly in Georgia, so a delay would be 
another blow to the Southland's battered aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The F-22's production has already been delayed by one year, and the size of 
the purchase has been cut from 750 planes to 442, prompting huge increases in 
its unit costs. Critics say the fighter is no longer needed now that the Soviet 
Union has disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anything is set in concrete," said Jeff Rhodes, Lockheed 
spokesman in Georgia. "Obviously, we're concerned. We're not alarmed." 
</P>
<P>
 Deutch said the cuts or delays may be needed to offset the cost of a 2.5% pay 
increase voted by Congress this year and to help finance improvements in 
military readiness and "other areas." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-page memo asks the four branches of the armed services to submit 
proposals for cutting or delaying the 10 programs or replacing them with 
less-expensive alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Northrop's Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile, other programs 
that Deutch suggested scrapping include the Comanche helicopter being jointly 
developed by Boeing Co. and United Technologies Corp. and the V-22 Osprey 
tilt-rotor plane, developed by Boeing and a unit of Textron Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 And the military is being asked to review the possibility of delaying another 
big-ticket item: the Navy's new radar-evading Stealth guided-missile destroyers 
-- in addition to the F-22. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear whether all of these reductions and cancellations 
would ultimately be made. Deutch set a deadline of Sept. 7 for the services to 
submit their new proposals. He said final decisions will be made later. 
</P>
<P>
 The new orders to cut back, which apparently came as a surprise to the 
individual services, marked the most striking indication yet that the Clinton 
Administration may be unable to meet its defense budget targets for the coming 
fiscal year without making drastic reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration had insisted last year that even with the pay raise and 
other requirements, it would be able to come close to its projected defense 
spending levels, though critics have challenged those assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 A Defense Department official said Monday that Deutch's memorandum was 
designed to alert the services early to the fact that the Pentagon will have to 
make some "very tough" decisions in next year's budget so they can come up with 
alternative cuts.  
</P>
<P>
 Reaction from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps was uniformly 
negative. Officers warned that the services have already been stretched thin by 
previous budget cuts and that cancellation of new programs could hurt readiness 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Ramsey, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, said company officials were 
pleased that none of their key defense-related programs were mentioned in the 
Pentagon's memo. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell's controversial C-17 cargo-jet program accounts for about 11,000 
aerospace jobs in Southern California, Ramsey said. But while Congress recently 
authorized continuation of the program, it has yet to approve further funding.

FREE-MARKET ACCEPTANCE; SUPPORT OF ERNESTO ZEDILLO IS SEEN AS ENDORSEMENT OF 
REFORM POLICIES IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING and CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investors and the business community on Monday celebrated the apparent 
election of economist Ernesto Zedillo to the Mexican presidency, sending stocks 
soaring nearly 51 points and driving the peso to its strongest position against 
the dollar in three months. 
</P>
<P>
 In a victory that echoed through Latin American markets, the choice of Zedillo 
was widely seen as an endorsement of this nation's free-market economic reforms 
and an assurance that those policies will continue into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists, brokers and investors were in broad agreement that the orderly 
outcome will hasten bricks-and-mortar investment in Mexico, and there were 
indications that dollars have already been sprung loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Doyle, a broker with Cushman Realty in San Diego, said he heard from 
three clients giving him the go-ahead for new plants and offices in Mexico. 
"It's a vote of confidence that the momentum is going to continue," Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The momentum also appears to be moving south. The Mexican election is the 
latest indication that the free-market reforms that have swept Latin America 
during the past decade are gaining political acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, prices rose sharply, reacting to the Mexico vote and to new polls 
favorable to free-market presidential candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The 
Sao Paulo Stock Exchange set a record for cash volume on a single day and 
gained 2,476 points, or 4.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 A stock broker said investors in Brazil were encouraged by public opinion 
surveys released over the weekend that show Cardoso could win a majority Oct. 3 
and avoid a second ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Free-market policies have been successful throughout the region," said Miguel 
Valenzuela, co-manager of the Emerging Mexico Fund, a New York Stock 
Exchange-listed fund of Mexican securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The election of Zedillo, who as budget minister was one of the principal 
architects of Mexico's free-market reforms, is viewed as an endorsement of 
those policies, which include the sale of government-owned companies, cutbacks 
in government subsidies and the slashing of import tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It creates confidence and confirms the direction that Mexico is going and 
that the people are going along with Zedillo," said Kristie King Etchberger, 
who follows Latin American securities for Santa Monica-based D.A. Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican stock market had been rising for a week on expectations that 
Zedillo or Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, who also supports free-market economic 
policies, would win, Valenzuela said. "This was just a confirmation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsa market index soared 50.79 points, or 1.9%, to 2,758.97, its highest 
close since Feb. 17. American depositary shares of Telefonos de Mexico, which 
accounts for a quarter of the index, gained 1 to 66 1/2 and ranked as the most 
active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Hernandez, chairman of the Mexican Bankers Assn. and a strong Zedillo 
supporter, said, "The election returns are a clear mandate from the citizens to 
persevere with economic reform." 
</P>
<P>
 In the medium term, Valenzuela said, Zedillo's election reduces uncertainty 
and risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have 10-plus clients who were slowing decisions, key business decisions, 
pending the outcome of the election," said Timothy Tuggey, a San Antonio 
attorney who represents both U.S. and Mexican companies looking to expand trade 
across borders. "Now you'll see a gradual increase in investment. These players 
will now seriously get into the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. companies already in Mexico feared that a new administration would have 
created the need to forge a new set of relationships, a time-consuming process, 
said Marlene Martin, a lawyer experienced in trade who now heads the trust 
department at Frost National Bank in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new administration would have created years of delays in understanding the 
system in Mexico," said Neil Whiteley-Ross, vice president of the San Diego 
Economic Development Corp. "Now people know that the way of doing business last 
month will be the way of doing business next month," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 However, other observers worried that Zedillo's huge margin and early returns 
indicating that his Institutional Revolutionary Party will continue to dominate 
the Mexican Congress could slow efforts to make this nation more democratic, 
causing problems over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing worse than a stalemate in the political process when the 
economy is in the process of modernization," said economist Rogelio Ramirez de 
la O. "This is not a stable equilibrium."  
</P>
<P>
 He added that Zedillo's mandate will assure the continuation of the current 
economic policies, but warned, "If it continues in the same style, ignoring the 
need for more comprehensive concessions, there will be increasing social 
tensions, and it will be difficult to appease quasi-guerrilla groups like those 
in Chiapas."

6 ACCUSED OF FRAUD IN FILING FOR SBA LOANS; LENDING: AGENCY SAYS THEY LIED 
ABOUT INCOME TO BORROW ALMOST $1 MILLION. THEY ULTIMATELY DEFAULTED ON LOANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grand jury in Los Angeles has indicted six people for allegedly 
making false statements on their income tax forms to obtain almost $1 million 
in Small Business Administration loans that ultimately defaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictments, announced Monday, are the first legal action stemming from a 
three-year investigation aimed at the SBA's problems with borrowers filing 
inflated income statements in support of their loan applications. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of growing fraud, the SBA has seen a rash of loan defaults -- 
particularly in Southern California -- that are likely to cost the federal 
agency and participating banks tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope these indictments will prevent others from using (false tax returns) 
as a tactic to get SBA loans," said Steve Marica, assistant inspector general 
for the agency in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Marica said the indictment of the six people "is the largest group of 
indictments against borrowers for tax returns we've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation, which began in Southern California and has since expanded 
to other states, is ongoing and is expected to result in more indictments. 
Marica said the agency is considering cross-checking tax statements of all 
applicants nationwide with those filed with the Internal Revenue Service. 
Currently, all SBA applications in Southern California are cross-checked with 
the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fraudulent SBA loan applications have been linked to so-called loan 
packagers -- independent consultants who help put together SBA applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraud related to loan packagers has increased in recent years as the volume of 
SBA loans has surged -- to $6.4 billion last year, more than double that of 
five years earlier -- while conventional business loans have all but dried up. 
</P>
<P>
 The six people indicted are Giam Buu Truong of Fountain Valley; Long Chan 
Quach, formerly of Cerritos and now of Pinellas Park, Fla.; Meng Hong Phou and 
Lim Chou of Colton, Calif., and Harris Hoang and Linh Diep of Irvine. All 
except Quach were arrested and arraigned Monday and all have been released on 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the six could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, each of the defendants could face fines of up to $8 million and 
prison terms of up to 300 years. Realistically, the sentences will be 
significantly less, but officials say they are expecting some jail time and 
restitution from the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictments, the six defendants submitted SBA loan 
applications between 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 They had disparate businesses in different locations, but they all used the 
same loan packager in Westminster, whom SBA officials would not identify 
because he is still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The six indicted "knowingly and willingly went ahead" with what the loan 
packager was doing, said Deborah Jones, a special agent at the SBA inspector 
general's office in Los Angeles, which conducted the investigation. Jones said 
the Westminster loan packager is being investigated for many more SBA loans 
that went sour. 
</P>
<P>
 A loan packager, for a fee, puts together financial statements, tax returns 
and other reports that go into an SBA application. The SBA guarantees 70% to 
90% of small-business loans that are funded by banks and other commercial 
lenders. The agency can generally guarantee a loan of up to $750,000.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO SOAK UP NEUTROGENA; ACQUISITIONS: HEALTH PRODUCTS COMPANY 
WILL PAY A PREMIUM PRICE TO EXPAND ITS LINE OF SKIN AND HAIR CARE PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aiming to broaden its offerings in the skin care business, Johnson & Johnson 
said Monday that it will pay a premium price of $924.1 million to acquire 
Neutrogena, the maker of premium-priced soaps, shampoos and other beauty 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 A deal had been widely expected after Los Angeles-based Neutrogena said 
earlier this month it was holding buyout talks with a "substantially larger" 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson & Johnson will pay $35.25 cash for each Neutrogena share -- a 63% 
premium over the market price before Neutrogena disclosed Aug. 10 that it was 
talking with a possible buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts praised the deal and said they doubted a rival would step forward to 
break it up, mainly because of the high price offered by Johnson & Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase unites Neutrogena's well-regarded lines of skin and hair products 
with such venerable brands as Johnson's Baby Shampoo and Baby Oil. Johnson & 
Johnson -- which also makes Tylenol pain reliever, Band-Aids and the skin 
treatment Retin-A -- has been trying to expand its line of skin care products. 
</P>
<P>
 Neutrogena shares rocketed $6.02 to $34.77 in Nasdaq trading Monday. The stock 
had traded as low as $16 earlier this year. Johnson & Johnson shares added 12.5 
cents to $49.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Temple, an analyst with Salomon Bros. in New York, said the deal will be 
a big boost to Johnson & Johnson's efforts to build its skin products business. 
"Johnson & Johnson spends a lot of money on skin care research -- they came up 
with Retin-A -- and what they add here is a strong brand franchise in the 
Neutrogena name," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides its baby-care line, New Brunswick, N.J.-based Johnson & Johnson also 
has the Clean and Care skin care line for teen-agers that it purchased from 
Revlon in 1991. But that brand lacks the broad consumer recognition and 
reputation for quality enjoyed by Neutrogena. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson & Johnson's product research should help Neutrogena develop new 
products to compete with recent "high-tech" skin products from such competitors 
as Oil of Olay and Avon, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest health products company, will also be 
able to lend its expertise in international markets to boost Neutrogena sales 
abroad. Temple puts Neutrogena's international sales at $72 million this year, 
out of total sales of $307 million. In contrast, many personal care products 
firms have sales two to three times better overseas than in the United States, 
she notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Neutrogena products are sold in 72 countries, Neutrogena Chairman 
Lloyd E. Cotsen declared it a company goal to "plant the Neutrogena flag 
internationally." The company recently opened offices in Latin America and 
test-marketed its hand creams in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors have circulated for years that Cotsen -- who directly and through his 
family controls 45% of the company -- was interested in selling. The talk began 
after sales and earnings at Neutrogena, which enjoyed spectacular growth 
through much of the 1980s, began to slip. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months ended April 30, net earnings were flat, at about $9.3 
million, and sales were off 2% to $133.7 million from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotsen personally owns 9.87 million of the 25.7 million Neutrogena shares 
outstanding. He will reap about $347.9 million, before taxes, by tendering his 
stake. Neutrogena officials did not return several phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber analyst Andrew Shore said Cotsen, 65, and Allan H. Kurtzman, the 
firm's 67-year-old president and chief operating officer, apparently were ready 
to sell their interests and hand over the company to a new owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotsen "can go out with his head held high and know that he's passed on 
something of value to someone," Shore said.

 By acquiring Neutrogena, Johnson & Johnson adds more than 45 products to its 
own small but venerable line of skin and hair care products, including its 
mainstay, Johnson's Baby Shampoo. Analysts say J&J benefits by acquiring a 
widely respected line pf products, while Neutrogena gains a deep-pocketed 
parent that can help expand its international sales.

 Delta Taps AT&T for Computer Operations: The carrier hired AT&T Corp.'s 
computer subsidiary to run many of its computer operations, part of a 
cost-cutting program at the nation's third-largest airline, sources said. The 
multibillion-dollar deal, to be formally announced today, represents the first 
major computer services contract for AT&T's Global Information Solutions 
division, formerly NCR Corp. It is also makes Delta Air Lines the biggest 
airline to turn over much of its computer systems to another company. Under the 
arrangement, AT&T will run Delta's administrative computers -- those used for 
accounting, payroll and other functions.

 Some Oil Strikers Return to Work in Nigeria: For the first time since they 
began a pro-democracy stoppage more than six weeks ago, some workers returned 
to their jobs.The news helped drive world oil prices sharply lower. Oil 
industry officials said it was too early to assess whether the strike had been 
broken even though some workers appeared to have heeded a government order to 
return to work. Oil Minister Don Etiebet said many of the workers had reported 
to work after being ordered to do so by military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha. 
Nigeria's vital oil industry has been severely disrupted by the strike, which 
was called to demand the release and installation of Moshood Abiola as 
president.

 New York to Rule on Macy-Federated Merger: The attorney general's office is 
expected to announce today whether it will oppose the planned merger of R.H. 
Macy & Co. and Federated Department Stores.The attorney general has scheduled a 
news conference for today, prompting speculation that the office will object to 
aspects of the planned merger on antitrust grounds. The Federal Trade 
Commission ended its review of the planned deal Friday, concluding that such a 
merger would not violate federal antitrust laws. New York-based Macy -- 
operator of the Macy's, Bullock's and I. Magnin chains -- and Federated reached 
a tentative merger agreement July 13.

a third production crew at its truck plant in Wayne, Mich., in February, a move 
that will create about 900 new assembly jobs. Ford said the third crew will 
allow the plant to produce an additional 32,000 F-Series full-size pickup 
trucks and Ford Bronco sport-utility vehicles a year, bringing the plant's 
annual output to 240,000 vehicles.

<P>
 Another steep fall in the dollar sent bond yields sharply higher Monday and 
clipped stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities markets, oil prices slumped to their lowest level since early 
May on expectations of ballooning supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's action held sway over most other markets. The buck edged back 
toward its record low against the Japanese yen as dealers grew pessimistic 
about the outlook for progress in bogged-down U.S.-Japan trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar fell to 97.83 Japanese yen, down from 98.65 on Friday 
and near its all-time New York low of 97.50 reached July 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also weakened against the German mark, falling to 1.527 from 1.539 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite hopes that the Federal Reserve Board's recent boost in short-term 
interest rates would bolster the dollar, it has continued to slide, reflecting 
in part a lack of confidence in the United States by foreign investors, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also said Monday that some currency traders were spooked by rumors 
that the German central bank has decided it is finished cutting interest rates 
and may in fact need to begin tightening credit soon as Europe's economy 
revives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S. Treasury bond market, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond 
jumped to 7.55% from 7.48% on Friday. Shorter-term yields also rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds are hurt as the dollar weakens because foreign investors are reluctant 
to buy U.S. securities, fearing that the falling dollar will continue to 
devalue U.S. assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said stocks and bonds were in part victims of typically slow 
summer-Monday trading activity, but stocks held up better than bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average eased just 3.89 points to 3,751.22 as 235.8 
million shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 
on the NYSE.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense stocks were broadly lower on fears about new cutbacks in Pentagon 
spending. Boeing fell 7/8 to 44 1/8, Lockheed dropped 1 1/4 to 63 1/8, 
McDonnell-Douglas slumped 2 3/4 to 112 5/8, Northrop Grumman lost 3/4 to 42 1/4 
and United Technologies gave up 3/4 to 60 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks, the market's recent leaders, turned mixed. Novell slumped 
1 1/8 to 14 after the computer networker warned that quarterly earnings will be 
below expectations. Other losers included Cabletron Systems, down 2 1/2 to 102; 
Dial Page, down 1 1/2 to 25 1/4, and IBM, off 3/8 to 67 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 But Digital Equipment gained 5/8 to 23 1/8, Compaq rose 1 to 37 5/8, Applied 
Materials jumped 1 1/2 to 51 3/4 and Cypress Semiconductor added 1/2 to 19 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the upside, some classic growth stocks continued to advance. Quaker Oats 
jumped 2 1/8 to 84, Gillette leaped 1 7/8 to 71 7/8 and Procter & Gamble gained 
5/8 to 56 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexican stocks traded in the United States followed their home market higher 
as investors celebrated the apparent election of the ruling party's 
presidential candidate Sunday. On the NYSE, Telmex gained 1 to 66 1/2, Empresas 
ICA surged 1 3/8 to 31 3/8 and Coca-Cola Femsa leaped 1 1/2 to 34 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican peso also strengthened against the dollar. It cost 3.338 pesos to 
buy a dollar in New York on Monday, compared to 3.359 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other foreign markets, Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei index fell 118.12 points to 
20,394.58, continuing its recent selloff. In Frankfurt, the DAX index slid 
25.78 points to 2,123.79, while London's FTSE-100 index lost 20.1 points to 
3,171.3. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. commodities trading, September crude oil futures in New York tumbled 
71 cents to $16.87 a barrel, the lowest settlement for a near-term contract 
since May 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the perception is growing that crude supplies will be plentiful 
in the next couple of months, helped by higher production from the North Sea. 
Also, traders are losing conviction that Nigeria's current oil workers strike 
will last.

 3-Month T-Bill Rates Climb to Nearly 3-Year High: The Treasury Department sold 
$12.22 billion of new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.62%, 
up from 4.59% last week. Another $12.33 billion of new six-month bills was sold 
at an average discount rate of 4.98%, down from 4.99%.The three-month bill rate 
was the highest since they sold for 4.59% on Nov. 12, 1991. The six-month bill 
rate was the lowest since they averaged 4.93% two weeks ago. The new discount 
rates understate the actual return to investors: 4.74% for three-month bills, 
with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,881.90, and 5.18% for a six-month bill 
selling for $9,748.20. The discount rate reflects the price discount received 
when government securities are purchased at less than face value. T-Bill

STATE MAY SHARE IN $1-BILLION EXPANSION BY JAPAN'S NEC; COMPUTERS: CHIP MAKER 
CONSIDERING SITES NEAR SACRAMENTO AND IN SCOTLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California expects to get at least part -- if not all -- of NEC Corp.'s 
$1-billion investment in new computer-chip manufacturing facilities, economic 
development officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The giant Japanese company confirmed that it plans the investment to expand 
production of 16-megabit dynamic random access memory chips -- components of 
almost all personal computers -- and eventually add 64- and 256-megabit chips.  
</P>
<P>
 NEC officials say the new production facilities will be built at one or both 
of the NEC manufacturing plants outside Japan -- in Roseville, Calif., near 
Sacramento, and an older plant in Livingston, Scotland. And California 
officials are upbeat about the Roseville plant's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the recent meetings we've had (with NEC), we're confident there will be 
an expansion at the Roseville facility," said Bill George, a spokesman for the 
state's Trade and Commerce Agency. State officials, including Gov. Pete Wilson, 
met with NEC executives in Tokyo last November and subsequently in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew about the Scotland issue," George said. "We believe that they may 
make major investments at both locations, and they are not necessarily in 
competition with each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Childs, associate vice president of operations at NEC's Roseville 
plant, does not expect a decision on the expansion plans until spring. "Our 
fiscal year ends in March, and I think this will go down to the wire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another California delegation -- including the mayor of Roseville -- will go 
to Tokyo in October, according to Al Gianini, executive director of the 
Sacramento Area Commerce and Trade Organization, the regional economic 
development agency that has been part of the effort to attract the investment 
to California. 
</P>
<P>
 A $1-billion addition to the Roseville site would double NEC's investment in 
the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The location has not been decided yet," NEC spokesman Mark Pearce told 
Reuters news service Monday in Tokyo. "Both governments are trying hard to get 
the NEC contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Press reports have indicated that a big factor in NEC's investment strategy 
would be its assessment of the market potential for chips in Europe and the 
United States. The firm wants to expand outside Japan to cut manufacturing 
costs and counter the export disadvantage posed by the strong yen. 
</P>
<P>
 California officials declined to discuss the lures they are setting to induce 
NEC to choose the Roseville site. "I wouldn't want Scotland to know what we're 
doing," Gianini said. 
</P>
<P>
 But George expects the state to benefit from legislative action in 1993 that 
changes the workers' compensation system and a variety of business tax 
provisions.

AT&T AND INTEL TO COOPERATE ON PC SOFTWARE FOR VIDEO CALLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AT&T Corp. and Intel Corp. said Monday that they will work together so video 
calls and conferences done via personal computer become as simple as using a 
regular telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies, which have developed competing desktop PC video software, said 
they will have those products working with each other by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, AT&T said it will develop directory assistance, operator 
assistance, security features and other services for video calling like those 
that have long existed for voice. 
</P>
<P>
 A key goal of the two companies is to reduce the 10 to 15 minutes it can take 
to set up a video conference to a few point-and-click mouse commands on the PC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Currently it's very difficult and can be time-consuming to make a video 
conferencing connection," said Bruce Ryon, analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San 
Jose. "For this technology to be adopted on a widespread level, they're going 
to have to make it as easy as a telephone call." 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T, which runs the world's largest telecommunications network, is looking 
for video calls to increase usage and revenue of that system. Intel, the 
largest maker of computer chips, believes that complex uses for a computer, 
like video calls, will drive demand for more advanced chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Both AT&T and Intel began selling desktop data-sharing and video programs 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The systems have been used chiefly by financial, legal and medical firms, the 
companies said.

GLUED TO THE KEYBOARD? TIME TO PUNCH UP A PIZZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So you wanna order a pizza? Well, keep in mind that this is the digital age. 
</P>
<P>
 First, you'll need a personal computer with a modem.And a direct connection to 
the Internet computer network. Oh, and some software called Mosaic, which 
incidentally can be kind of a pain to install but once up and running allows 
you to browse the "World Wide Web," complete with pictures, sound and video 
clips.  
</P>
<P>
 You're no doubt hungry now, so at the prompt, type http://www.pizzahut.com. 
</P>
<P>
 Up comes an illustrated menu. All you need to do is type in your name, 
address, phone number and selection. Feel like a Super Supreme tonight? Just 
click. Fiber-optic cables take care of the rest. You pay when it arrives at 
your door. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to cyberspace, where Pizza Hut on Monday began testing the first pizza 
delivery service over the information superhighway. For the pilot program, a 
Pizza Hut outlet in Santa Cruz has been hooked up to a server at the firm's 
Wichita, Kan., headquarters. Depending on customer response, the service -- 
dubbed PizzaNet -- may be expanded to other areas after 90 days. It may not be 
a huge revenue generator right now, concedes Pizza Hut technology expert Jon 
Payne, but the minimal cost of running it makes it worth a try. "I don't think 
this is going to replace the phone," he said, "but there are a lot of people 
out there signing up for the Internet, and this is just one more way to provide 
for our customers." AMY HARMON

PEOPLE: VANS NAMES NEW PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Christopher G. Staff has been selected as president and chief operating 
officer at Vans Inc., the tennis shoe manufacturer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff, 52, who has been president and chief executive of the Speedo and Action 
Sports divisions of Van Nuys-based Authentic Fitness Corp. since 1990, will 
join Vans on Sept. 16 at its headquarters in Orange.Staff succeeds Vans Vice 
Chairman Walter E. Schoenfeld, 63, who became president on an interim basis in 
April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoe industry analysts said the appointment is in keeping with Vans' effort to 
restore revenue and profitability. "I'm not comfortable saying that Vans is all 
the way back, but they're clearly making changes and they're on track with the 
schedule (Schoenfeld) set last year," said Seth Feinstein, a Los Angeles-based 
analyst with Crowell, Weedon & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Vans shares rose 25 cents Monday to $5.50 in Nasdaq trading. The stock had 
traded as high as $13 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Vans, a familiar footwear name among Southern Californians, has struggled in 
recent years to reverse a slowdown in domestic and international sales. The 
company's revenue was hurt in recent years by the economic slowdown in Southern 
California, where the company operates 78 stores. GREG JOHNSON

 Banks Making More Business Loans: A national survey of bank lending found that 
banks are continuing to ease credit terms for business and consumer loans, but 
that the changes had little to do with the Clinton Administration's 
loan-stimulation package announced in March, 1993, the Federal Reserve Board 
said. The Fed's August survey showed that demand for business loans had 
increased at a significant number of banks, with many lenders attributing the 
increase to financing needs on the part of businesses wishing to expand their 
inventories. Consumer lending has lagged, however: More than half the banks 
reported a significant decline in demand for home mortgage loans, reflecting 
sharply higher interest rates this year that have choked off refinancings.

 IDB Communications Reports Loss: The Culver City-based satellite 
communications firm said its net loss in the second quarter was $14.6 million, 
or 20 cents a share, which the company blamed partly on accounting changes. 
Revenue was $124.3 million.IDB, which has been embroiled in controversy since 
its accountants resigned in protest in May, said it has changed its accounting 
procedures for inbound international long-distance traffic at the suggestion of 
its new auditors. IDB had been criticized for booking revenue before it was 
received. The accounting change produced $4.2 million of the quarter's pretax 
loss of $24.9 million, IDB said. It also said $20.4 million of the pretax loss 
was caused by onetime items, including "addition to sales credit and allowance 
for doubtful accounts." LDDS Communications, which previously agreed to buy IDB 
in a stock swap, said the loss was expected and should not affect the merger 
plan.

 Price Waterhouse said it nominated James J. Schiro as chairman and senior 
partner of the accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiro, 48, was nominated to succeed Shaun F. O'Malley next July 1.O'Malley 
will have reached the accounting firm's mandatory retirement age of 60. 
</P>
<P>
 The nomination is subject to approval of the firm's approximate 970 partners, 
a process that is under way. A spokeswoman said the firm expects to complete 
the vote in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiro is vice chairman for the firm's metropolitan New York region. He has 
been a partner of the firm since 1979. Price Waterhouse spokeswoman Jan Butler 
said Schiro was traveling and unavailable for comment.

'SOAP SALESMAN'; NEUTROGENA CEO TAKES A MODEST VIEW OF HIS SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lloyd E. Cotsen sometimes refers to himself simply as a "soap salesman," a 
description modest by many degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 He has lived a life of privilege and culture, residing in the toniest Westside 
neighborhoods and supporting the arts with a modesty often lacking in the 
area's entertainment-driven philanthropic community. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a successful executive who has been known to leave the cares of business 
behind for an archeological field trip to Greece or the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
 He's rich. Cotsen stands to make nearly $350 million when the company he runs, 
Neutrogena, is sold to Johnson & Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 And, by popular account, he's "knock-out" handsome. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotsen (pronounced Coat-zen) graduated from Princeton University with a 
history degree in 1950, did graduate studies at Princeton, went on 
archeological digs and, in 1953, married Jo Anne Stolaroff. After he completed 
Harvard Business School in 1957, the couple moved west and Cotsen went to work 
for his father-in-law, Emanuel Stolaroff, founder of Natone Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Stolaroff had built Natone, the story goes, on the success of a lip brush. 
Neutrogena -- a translucent soap with the color of amber and an evocative scent 
-- was a side product, licensed from a Belgian soap maker. 
</P>
<P>
 According to company legend, it was Cotsen who devised the marketing strategy 
that made Neutrogena so popular -- and so important to the company's finances 
-- that in 1963 the company changed its name. Four years later, he was made 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the stories Cotsen tells about himself is of getting an early batch of 
the soap too thick and climbing in one of the huge vats -- sans clothing -- to 
unstick the goo. While bending over, he was nicked by a sharp mixing blade. 
(The blades were later replaced with ones with rounded edges.) 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Cotsen, 65, has not lived a charmed life. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1979, he was in New York on a business trip when he heard on a cab 
radio that his wife, the youngest of their four children and another teen-ager 
had been shot by a masked intruder at the family's Beverly Hills home. His wife 
and the teen-ager died the day after the attack. His son Noah, 14, died a week 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy took a bizarre twist six months later. Police believed a chief 
rival of Cotsen's at the Belgian company that made Neutrogena had committed the 
killing. But the suspect died just as police were to question him. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Cotsen found solace in his work. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, he married Jacqueline Brandwynne, a New York consultant who had been 
on Neutrogena's board for a year. The second Mrs. Cotsen went to work for the 
company. In a 1992 lawsuit related to the couple's divorce, she said she helped 
formulate the strategy that expanded Neutrogena's product lines into shampoos 
and related items. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotsen was named chief executive of Neutrogena in 1982. Two years later, 
Emanuel Stolaroff died. In 1991, Cotsen added the chairman's title. 
</P>
<P>
 He continues to be active in archeology and is said to have an excellent 
collection of primitive art. Profile: Lloyd E. Cotsen 
</P>
<P>
 Born: Feb. 25, 1929 
</P>
<P>
 Hometown: Boston 
</P>
<P>
 Education: Princeton University, undergraduate and graduate studies; Harvard 
Business School 
</P>
<P>
 Career highlights: Joined Natone Co. in 1957. Given Neutrogena bar soap 
account, he devised marketing strategy of offering free samples to physicians 
and dermatologists; by 1963, the amber soap was company's best-selling product. 
Named Neutrogena president in 1967; became chief executive in 1982 and chairman 
in 1991.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; FRENCH FIRM TESTS HOLLYWOOD WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hachette, the Paris-based publishing giant behind such popular magazines as 
Elle, Woman's Day and Metropolitan Home, is in discussions about expanding its 
presence in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Bigle, the new chairman of Hachette's Film Office division, has met 
with senior executives at Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures and other 
entertainment companies during a 10-day swing through Los Angeles. Bigle said 
he's scouting for projects that will help extend Hachette's reach into the 
French home video, television, theatrical and merchandising markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make the Film Office more of an entertainment division," said the 
43-year-old Bigle. "It's my intention to develop the company. If I find 
something, I will put the money on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 Bigle is specifically discussing film and TV co-productions. While Hachette 
might commit to broader joint ventures, he said it is not looking to acquire an 
entire company. Bigle expects to announce the first of his deals, involving 
family entertainment, soon. He is also in discussions about opening a Los 
Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood always welcomes new money, especially from deep-pocketed companies 
such as Hachette, a division of the Lagardere Group, which had more than $10 
billion in sales last year. But those investments carry more than a little 
risk. Canal Plus, the French pay TV giant, is a major investor in perennially 
troubled Carolco Pictures. Another French company, CIBY 2000, closed its Los 
Angeles office after much fanfare, following the failure of its "Twin Peaks: 
Fire Walk With Me." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on what he's observed, Bigle says, it makes better business sense to 
invest in specific projects than in companies, but he says he also wants to 
build long-term relationships. As the European Union considers possible 
barriers to American entertainment imports, Bigle adds, "I'm sure we can find 
studios that will be happy to have a French partner in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While vast French companies like Hachette have reputations for moving slowly, 
one executive who specializes in the international market agreed with Bigle's 
assessment of the market. "Hollywood is very open to deals, especially after 
being excluded from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade," the executive 
said. "More things will happen between now and next year than ever. You won't 
recognize the entertainment map." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Bigle's first priority is expanding Hachette's presence in home 
video, a market that's underdeveloped in France. One plan calls for putting 
videos in the kiosks where Hachette's magazines are sold. The company has a 
nine-picture deal with Cinergi Pictures, a limited video retailing pact with 
Disney and an uncompleted deal with Carolco. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While many of his countrymen are fighting to curtail the pervasive influence 
of Hollywood films in France, Bigle calls himself a big fan. "You have 
fantastic product here," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Lagardere Group independently exploring new-media opportunities, 
Bigle has focused on marketing entertainment with Hachette's magazines. A third 
target is merchandising, which helps explain his interest in family 
entertainment. "It makes sense to control the product from beginning to end," 
Bigle said. "That's how you get the most bang for the buck." 
</P>
<P>
 People who have worked with Bigle say he's well qualified to exploit those 
opportunities. His father, Armand, handled Walt Disney Co. films in France, and 
the younger Bigle played at Walt Disney's house and attended the opening of 
Disneyland. He later became vice president of Walt Disney Co. France before 
leaving to form his own United Communication. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dominique has been dealing with the major studios and leading independents 
for years," said Stephen A. Unger, managing director of the worldwide 
entertainment and communications practice at SpencerStuart, an executive 
recruiting firm. "He wasn't wanting for job opportunities. He could have picked 
his spot at any of the American or European majors." 
</P>

 Cinderfella Story: Twentieth Century Fox on Friday quietly purchased the 
rights to the first screenplay by Antwone Fisher, who until last fall was 
employed in a vastly different studio capacity -- as a security guard at Sony 
Pictures Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The script, tentatively titled "The Antwone Fisher Story," is based on the 
moving life story of the former security guard, who was born in jail without 
knowing any members of his family and raised in a series of sometimes abusive 
homes before enlisting in the Navy, where a psychiatrist encouraged him to 
begin a process of self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, 35, was found by producers Randa Haines and Todd Black while 
participating in a screenwriting program led by Chris Smith in South-Central 
Los Angeles, just one month before he would have lost his job as part of Sony's 
decision to contract out its security work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox-based producers set him up in an office, paid him a weekly salary and 
helped him learn the basic techniques involved in screenwriting. Asked to 
describe Fisher's finished product, Haines said: "It's about hope. It's about 
how one person can save themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox declined to discuss the project. But sources say Fisher will receive in 
the low to mid-six figures if the film is made.

 Television: Call it Disney goes Deutschland. The entertainment giant is 
joining with European television broadcaster Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de 
Telediffusion Multi Media to launch a new family channel in Germany starting in 
January.The satellite-cable channel will be called Super RTL. CLT, which has 
interests in 10 television stations and 13 radio stations in nine countries, is 
a major shareholder in Europe's RTL Television and RTL2 channel. Programs 
offered over the channel are expected to include animated series, live- action 
shows, feature films and entertainment specials. The channel is expected to 
reach up to 35% of German television homes when it is launched. As part of the 
deal, Disney agreed to be a long-term supplier of programs to CLT Multi Media 
and to join the company in developing services in other markets. Disney 
Chairman Michael D. Eisner said the venture will allow Disney to evaluate the 
potential for similar European services. CLT's shareholders include Belgium 
Group, France's Group Havas and the Paribas Group. JAMES BATES

COMPANY TOWN; HOLLYWOOD FILMMAKERS ZOOM IN ON CZECH REPUBLIC, SLOVAKIA; MOVIES: 
DESPITE SOME PROBLEMS, SUPERB LOCATIONS AND BARGAIN PRICES ATTRACT ATTENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Czech President Vaclav Havel once complained to a reporter that the problems 
in the former Soviet Bloc countries seemed insoluble. "We are finding out that 
what looked like a neglected house a year ago is in fact a ruin." 
</P>
<P>
 Call it luck, but the playwright-philosopher's dismal economic metaphor has 
become a cinematic asset. Ruins, medieval and baroque buildings, even crumbling 
castles, are attracting a slew of U.S., Canadian and other foreign filmmakers 
to the former workers' paradises of the Czech Republic and its neighbor, 
Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Raffaella de Laurentiis recently ventured into Slovakia for the 
making of "Dragonheart," a Universal Pictures 10th-Century drama starring Sean 
Connery, Dennis Quaid and a computer-generated dragon. The cast and crew spent 
their nights filming among the ruins of a sprawling 13th-Century hilltop 
castle, Spisske Hrad, 350 miles east of Prague. 
</P>
<P>
 De Laurentiis said the production will pump $5 million to $7 million into the 
local economy. She also estimates she's saving a third on her production costs. 
"The props, the costumes and the sets -- we're having them all made at the 
studio. We (even) found people who can still embroider," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The superb locations and experienced crews with lower salary demands also 
lured the maker of Home Box Office's "Fatherland," a Cold War thriller based on 
the premise that Adolf Hitler won World War II. With its blend of old and new, 
Prague became 1964 Berlin under the rule of the 75-year-old Hitler. "Our crew 
costs were about one-third of those in Los Angeles," said Gideon Amir, a 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
 For the "Fatherland" production staff, prices at a Western-style hotel in 
central Prague were the only drawback to an otherwise happy filming experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could only negotiate $80 a night," said producer Ilene Kahn, who is 
accustomed to a $40 to $50 outlay. But then she ran into a difficulty no one 
could have foreseen. For a crowd scene, the crew hung a three-story-high banner 
from the hotel, proclaiming that "the Fuhrer has promised peace and 
prosperity." The hotel management received so many complaints that the crew was 
forced to find other accommodations in its last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The other drawbacks to working in the Czech Republic include poor telephone 
service, the need to hire interpreters and -- worst of all in some people's 
view -- a deficiency of California cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 But pioneers who ventured forth four years ago say those problems are minor 
compared to the early days when an inoperative telephone system, a lack of 
fresh fruit and vegetables and technicians' penchant for long lunches and short 
working days played havoc with shooting schedules and team comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Rick McCallum started filming "The Indiana Jones Chronicles" in 1990. 
The show was canceled by ABC but was picked up by the Family Channel for four 
new episodes this fall. "In the first year, we fired 30 out of 60 crew members 
by Christmas," he said. "Crews weren't used to the long hours. They took long 
lunches and they drank too much." 
</P>
<P>
 But past clumsiness has proved a modern advantage. Foreign filmmakers have to 
work through a Czech holding company, so McCallum early on helped finance a 
quintet of young producers, who supply him with the crews and book the same 
people again and again. The Czechs and Slovaks learned quickly. "We only bring 
in department heads," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Prague stood in for Paris, Vienna, Rome, St. Petersburg, Stockholm and Munich 
for McCallum and his crew over 42 days this spring. "It's the cheapest place 
for us to film, with the best locations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Skylines and streets without commercial signs, billboards or TV antennas made 
shoots easier and less costly. Permits to film in palaces "equivalent to the 
sumptuousness of Buckingham Palace" can be had in days. "It would take six 
months elsewhere in Europe," said McCallum, who estimates he saved $600,000 on 
a $1.2-million episode. 
</P>
<P>
 For scenes requiring thousands of extras, he paid $8 a day, compared to $100 
in the United States. He put everyone up in apartments rather than hotels and 
arranged morning meetings at subway stops. Those gatherings made it easier to 
inform people about daily changes in the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier difficulties with communications have eased, but at a cost. Producers 
buy dedicated telephone lines but increasingly use the state system for fax and 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Food issues persist, particularly outside Prague. "We flew in a chef from 
England after three weeks of a 10-week shoot," said Bruce Davey, producer of 
"Immortal Beloved," a Beethoven love story starring Gary Oldman and Isabella 
Rossellini. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Davey estimates he saved $3 million to $4 million on the film backed by 
Mel Gibson's Icon Productions, with U.S. distribution by Columbia Pictures. "It 
allowed us to put more money on the screen," he said.

EXECUTIVE SUITE: COMPANY TOWN; ZISKIN TO HEAD FOX PRODUCTION UNIT; INCREASED 
OUTPUT SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of speculation, producer Laura Ziskin was officially named Monday 
to run a new mainstream film production unit at 20th Century Fox that is aimed 
at boosting the studio's output by as many as 12 movies a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziskin, whose credits include "Pretty Woman," "No Way Out" and "Hero," had 
been rumored for some time to be moving to Fox to run the unit, which has yet 
to be named. Fox said it expects the unit to come up with eight to 12 films a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is part of a major push by Fox to boost its output to about 30 films 
a year, in part to funnel more product into parent News Corp.'s huge global 
television empire. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the new Ziskin-run unit, Fox recently formed a family films 
unit, as well as Searchlight Pictures, which will produce and distribute films 
aimed at adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziskin's division is expected to operate in concert with the current 
production unit run by Tom Jacobson. Fox Chairman Peter Chernin said the 
separate unit is being set up because boosting production under Jacobson could 
stretch the operation too thin. He added that Jacobson was involved in the 
process and that the new unit will not diminish his authority. 
</P>
<P>
 * MCA Records has named Larry Jacobson director of recording administration 
and Chris Edwards director and administrator for soundtracks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rhino Records named Jenni Sperandeo national manager of radio and video 
promotion and William Smith promotion coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Agency for the Performing Arts named Stuart Miller executive vice 
president and Jim Kellem and Lee Dinsman senior vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vision International has named Zsuzsa Cziraky vice president of acquisitions 
and marketing and promoted Ted Perkins to director of international sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * Virgin Records named George Maloian director of creative projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * MGM/UA Telecommunications named Bill Lee senior vice president for worldwide 
pay television.

 Market trends: Microsoft Corp. was the volume leader in Monday's trading. Live 
Entertainment Inc. announced a second-quarter loss of $1.4 million on sales of 
$29.2 million, compared to a year-earlier loss of $1.5 million on sales of 
$44.3 million. The firm said the decrease was due to fewer video releases in 
the second quarter of 1994.

GAS FIREPLACE IS BECOMING A HOTTER ITEM; COMFORTS: CLEANLINESS, EASE OF USE 
FUEL GROWING POPULARITY. BIG FIRMS LIKE LENNOX ENTER MARKET THAT INCLUDES O.C. 
MAKERS.

<P>
 When Christopher Tower rebuilds his burned-out Laguna Beach home later this 
year, he plans to incorporate a beautiful wood-burning fireplace to complement 
the stunning Pacific Ocean view from his new living room. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a nearby bedroom, Tower is forsaking the allure of a wood-burner for a 
unit that burns natural gas. The second fireplace, Tower said, "is mainly for 
ambience . . . a gas fireplace is easy to use and it's clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Driven largely by ease of use, sales of gas hearth appliances are steadily 
increasing. In 1989, only 5% of factory-built fireplaces installed in U.S. 
homes burned gas. Now, gas hearth appliances account for 26% of all 
factory-built fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 In about five years, gas units will probably account for about half of all 
factory-built fireplaces installed in the United States, according to industry 
observers. Retailers also report strong demand for relatively inexpensive gas 
log sets and gas fireplace inserts, devices that convert wood-burning 
fireplaces to burn gas. 
</P>
<P>
 The move toward gas appliances reverses a trend that began in the 1970s, when 
jittery consumers responded to a string of energy shortfalls by chopping and 
burning cordwood. 
</P>
<P>
 One dramatic measure of wood's shrinking popularity: the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency believes that consumers in cold-weather regions were buying 1 
million energy-efficient wood stoves annually during the early 1980s. But in 
1993, retailers sold just 130,000 wood-burning stoves. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of gas hearth appliances are fueled in large part by the high cost of 
wood -- a cord of oak costs at least $300 in Orange County -- along with 
growing environmental concerns. The high cost of fuel makes wood-burning 
prohibitive, gas proponents said, especially in Southern California, where 
fireplaces typically are used as decorative, rather than heating, appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 But simple demographics also play a role. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all aging," said Hearth Assn. spokesman John Crouch. "Families that 
gathered and chopped their own heat in the form of firewood are finding that it 
just isn't as sexy an idea as it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Gas hearth appliances are especially popular in upstairs bedrooms and rooms 
that are decorated in light, airy colors. "You don't have to schlep wood up and 
ashes down and get everything dirty," said American Gas Assn. spokeswoman Julie 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Gas units are getting a strong push from the nation's natural gas utilities, 
some of which are offering rebates to customers who buy gas hearth appliances. 
The Southern California Gas Co. does not offer rebates but this past winter it 
did sponsor highway billboards promoting the use of gas logs. 
</P>
<P>
 In some Western states, gas fireplace sales are also being driven by tough 
emission-control regulations akin to federal Environmental Protection Agency 
regulations that govern wood stoves. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Las Vegas, one of the nation's fastest-growing cities, 
responded to a growing haze problem over the city by regulating emissions from 
wood-burning fireplaces. The regulations, which cover only new construction, 
mandate the use of catalytic converters or secondary combustion chambers that 
cost as much as $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Steve Wynns, Andre Agassis and resort moguls are still putting in 
wood-burning units but the standard subdivision home has a gas-burning unit," 
said Michael Naylor, director of the Air Pollution Control Division in Clark 
County, which encompasses Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas residents are taking the regulations in stride, Naylor said, 
because, as in Southern California, a fireplace is "mainly an entertainment 
device" that is seldom used as a primary heating source. 
</P>
<P>
 But manufacturers are using technological advances to meet energy-efficiency 
demands of consumers in cold-weather climates. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana-based Fireplace Manufacturers Inc., for example, continues to sell 
most of its units in warm climates. But the company is selling its gas 
fireplace units in Canada and Norway and hopes to enter the Chinese market 
through a joint venture with a natural gas company in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer demand for gas hearth appliances has sparked interest from some of 
the nation's largest heating, ventilation and air-conditioning manufacturers. 
Traditionally, the larger companies have ignored the market, which has long 
been dominated by smaller, regional competitors like Fireplace Manufacturers, 
Superior Fireplace Inc. in Fullerton and Robert H. Peterson Co. in the City of 
Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Dallas-based Lennox Industries Inc. introduced its first 
gas-fired fireplace. The unit, which initially will be sold in Canada, will be 
marketed in the United States in 1995. Industry sources said that Rheem 
Manufacturing Co. and Carrier Corp. are also developing gas fireplace units. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers credit increasing consumer demand to technological advances and 
crisp designs that result in attractive units that provide sufficient heat and 
are relatively inexpensive to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still more expensive for builders to install gas fireplaces in new homes 
than to incorporate gas-fired appliances, said Judy Bentley, gas product 
manager for Superior Fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're dealing with gas valves, burners, the guts of the gas-fired unit," 
Bentley said. "But builders know that people want gas units. Wood-fired 
fireplaces are becoming a pain in the butt for many people." 
</P>
<P>
 Gas-fired appliance manufacturers are using technology to develop products 
that provide higher efficiencies than wood-burning units. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fireplaces aren't just boxes with chimneys sticking out of them anymore," 
said John Hornsby, chief operating officer of Fireplace Manufacturers, which 
next year for the first time will offer more gas models than traditional 
wood-burning units. "Consumers increasingly are moving toward the gas 
fireplaces." 
</P>
<P>
 Its newest models offer highly efficient burners that don't require expensive 
chimneys. Some units can be vented through walls; others, while not yet legal 
in California, are vent-free and can be installed in the middle of a room. 
</P>
<P>
 Fireplace Manufacturers' units incorporate thermostats and hand-held, 
remote-control devices that turn flames on and off. Units without vents now on 
the market in some parts of the country include sensors that automatically shut 
down burners if the oxygen levels in a room fall below safe levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry has also devised a way to fix the age-old consumer complaint that 
a gas-fired unit's blue flame pales in comparison to the golden warmth of a 
wood fire. Researchers at the American Gas Assn.'s research and development 
facility in Cleveland developed a technology that lets gas-fired units mimic 
the yellow-gold flame -- if not the distinctive odor -- of a wood-burning 
fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert H. Peterson Co., which has been manufacturing relatively inexpensive 
gas log units for 45 years, also is using the new, golden-flame technology and 
remote-control devices to bolster sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "If installed properly, our set will look like wood burning in a fireplace," 
said Maurice Boekeloo, Peterson's vice president of marketing. "We think one of 
our (sets) burning in the fireplace is going to give you the right 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 But, if ambience alone isn't sufficient, Boekeloo quickly falls back on ease 
of use. "There's no cleaning, no ashes, no hassle," Boekeloo said. "When it's 
time to leave you simply turn it off."

O.C. AIRPORT PLAN WOULD ENCOURAGE DISCOUNT CARRIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Seeking to address the rapid changes in the airline industry, John Wayne 
Airport officials Monday disclosed a plan that could clear the way for new 
discount-oriented airlines, including Reno Air, to start service from Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations call for allowing airlines already serving the airport to 
share landing slots with carriers that do not currently serve the airport. It 
is similar to an arrangement backed by Reno Air and American Airlines earlier 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 If adopted, the "access plan" would represent a marked change from the present 
method of allocating flight slots every year at the noise-controlled airport. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past decade, airlines were only allowed to begin service if they won 
landing slots during an annual reallocation by the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, an airline could pick up slots either through the 
reallocation or through an affiliation with another carrier already operating 
at John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 To start, the host airline would have to permanently hand over two landing 
slots to a partner that is new to the airport. Then it could vary the number of 
additional slots it gives away up to a maximum of half of its authorized 
allocation. 
</P>
<P>
 By requiring a mandatory two-flight minimum, airport officials are trying to 
ensure that the new carrier would maintain a presence at John Wayne even if its 
partnership with its host should end. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of sharing landing slots became an issue two months ago when Reno 
Air, an upstart regional carrier that offers low fares, wanted to pick up as 
many as a half-dozen landing slots from American Airlines under a marketing 
agreement between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 American wanted to drop six flights to San Jose that it deemed unprofitable. 
But Reno Air, with lower operating costs, thought it could turn a dollar on the 
same route while participating in American's frequent-flier program and other 
customer loyalty programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Reno Air service to San Jose was due to start, however, the plan went 
awry. Other airlines objected, saying it was unfair to allow Reno Air to skip 
ahead of other carriers dutifully waiting for the annual reallocation. Federal 
regulators expressed concern about restrictions being placed on Reno Air's 
service by the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air withdrew the plan and decided to wait for whatever new policy the 
airport eventually adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Airport staff has put in a lot of effort to try to understand the issues and 
concerns of carriers, the FAA and Department of Transportation and the 
traveling public and it may be a difficult balance to achieve," said airport 
spokeswoman Courtney C. Wiercioch. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan now undergoes another round of comment from the airlines at John 
Wayne, then goes to the Airport Commission and Board of Supervisors for 
approval. Airport staffers said they hope the matter can come to a final vote 
Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan could meet opposition from some airlines that have already 
lobbied against allowing affiliations between carriers, such as United Airlines 
and USAir. Representatives of those two carriers could not be reached for 
comment late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Reno Air, the recommendations seem favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be a very fair policy which liberalizes access to the airport," 
said Robert M. Rowen, a Reno Air vice president. "We're very eager to start 
serving Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations also try to address other changes in the airline industry, 
such as linkages between national and international carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan asks that airlines like Northwest and USAir be allowed to install 
signs that indicate their affiliation with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and British 
Airways, respectively, even though the international carriers do not operate 
any flights at John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry has changed since the original affiliation policy was adopted 
and the county is attempting to be responsive to that change while protecting 
the county's interests and allowing carriers operating flexibility," Wiercioch 
said.

OFF THE TICKER: BARGAIN JEANS AT $2,500 A PAIR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like so many shoppers, Yo Murata was happy when he found that perfect pair of 
blue jeans: comfortable yet classic, broken-in but sturdy. And the price was 
right.Only $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to buy ones like I used to wear as a teen-ager," the 44-year-old 
fast-food franchise owner explained. 
</P>
<P>
 A vintage-jeans craze in Tokyo has given rise to about 100 boutiques catering 
to connoisseurs of faded denim and old-style copper rivets. Demand has pushed 
prices up to levels normally associated with haute couture. 
</P>
<P>
 Murata's purchase was two years ago, and he regards it as a great buy. These 
days, a pair of the same vintage jeans -- Levi's, circa 1950 -- fetch about 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The boom has sent an influx of Japanese buyers to the United States, inflating 
the price of used jeans around Los Angeles.

 Orange County has lost more than a dozen new car dealerships in recent years, 
but hope springs eternal in the souls of those who sell automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa-based Nabers Automotive Group, which runs Nabers Cadillac and 
Buick, has opened Nabers Isuzu four blocks farther north on Harbor Boulevard, 
just off the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lot opened about a month ago after Nabers acquired the Isuzu franchise 
that Theodore Robins Ford was abandoning in order to make room for its expanded 
Ford truck center. 
</P>
<P>
 And over in Garden Grove there's an old face in a new place, as Patterson 
Dodge has moved from its former Garden Grove Boulevard facility to the Garden 
Grove Freeway auto center location vacated more than a year ago by a Mitsubishi 
franchise.

NEW PRESIDENT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE NAMED BY VANS; MANAGEMENT: MOVE IS IN LINE WITH 
COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO RESTORE ITS FORTUNES, ANALYSTS SAY. 
</P>

 Christopher G. Staff, a top executive at Authentic Fitness Corp. in Van Nuys, 
has been selected as president and chief executive officer at Vans Inc., the 
tennis shoe manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff, 52, president and chief operating officer of the Speedo and Action 
Sports divisions of Authentic Fitness since 1990, will join Vans on Sept. 16 at 
its headquarters in Orange. Staff succeeds Vans Vice Chairman Walter E. 
Schoenfeld, 63, who became president on an interim basis in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoe industry analysts said the appointment was in keeping with Vans' ongoing 
bid to restore revenue and profitability. "I'm not comfortable saying that Vans 
is all the way back, but they're clearly making changes and they're on track 
with the schedule (Schoenfeld) set last year," said Seth Feinstein, a Los 
Angeles-based analyst with Crowell, Weedon & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Vans shares rose 25 cents on Monday to $5.50 in Nasdaq trading. The stock had 
traded as high as $13 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think given the great position Vans has in California there's tremendous 
opportunity to take this company nationwide," Staff said Monday. "We're going 
to be a marketing-driven company with a tremendous manufacturing base." 
</P>
<P>
 Staff said Vans has "in the last six months begun to reflect some of the 
opportunities in the market. The company has outstanding factories in 
California and it's now ready to take an aggressive posture in terms of 
expanding its base nationally." 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenfeld said that Staff "fits perfectly with what we're trying to do with 
the fashion and design team we've built over the past year." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through some difficult times and we've turned things around," said 
Schoenfeld, who continues as Vans' vice chairman and also assumes the position 
of chairman of the executive committee. "Things are looking much better and our 
business is showing dramatic signs of improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Vans, a familiar footwear name among Southern Californians, has struggled in 
recent years to reverse a slowdown in domestic and international sales. The 
company's revenue was hurt in recent years by the economic slowdown in Southern 
California, where the company operates 78 stores. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Vans reported that fourth-quarter net income fell to $879,000, or 
nine cents a share, from $1.2 million, or 13 cents, in the year-earlier period. 
Quarterly sales, however, rose slightly to $22.9 million, up from $22.7 million 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months the company has appointed several new top managers, including 
Karen J. Ratcliff, who was selected vice president and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said that Monday's announcement had been anticipated. "Walter 
Schoenfeld told us earlier this year that he wanted to have the new guy coming 
on," he said.

 Kia Plunges In: Kia Motors America, the new Korean car importer with North 
American headquarters in Irvine, is tackling the opposition head-on. 
</P>
<P>
 One of its early commercials compares the company's only U.S. car -- the 
Sephia compact sedan -- to the Honda Civic and suggests that the big difference 
is that the $8,995 Kia costs a lot less.A stripped four-door Civic starts at 
$11,750. That commercial has caused some complaints from commissioned sales 
people at the seven Honda dealerships that carry Kia as a secondary line. A 
manager at a San Francisco dealership told a trade magazine recently that 
customers often come in and tell the Honda sales agents they want to see the 
Kias. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Kia is tackling Chrysler Corp.'s vaunted Neon. A Chrysler billboard 
campaign earlier this year showed a front view of the new compact sedan with 
the legends "Say 'Hi!' to Neon." Kia has just put up a series of billboards 
that feature a front view of the Sephia with the legend "Say 'Bye!' to Neon."

 On-Line Auctions: Mitsubishi Motors Sales of America said it will begin 
holding satellite car auctions so that its dealers can bid on Mitsubishi cars 
and trucks coming back from rental and corporate fleets without having to 
physically travel to an auction site. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, a joint production of Cypress-based Mitsubishi and Aucnet USA in 
Atlanta, will enable Mitsubishi dealers to use computer screens in their 
offices to view photos of the cars and read the condition reports prepared for 
each vehicle.They will be able to enter their bids via computer as well.  
</P>
<P>
 Previously, dealers who wanted to buy low-mileage Mitsubishi vehicles to 
resell in their used car operations had to travel to one of the importer's 
super auctions where 1,000 or more cars are put on the block every few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer program will debut in Mitsubishi's Northeastern territory in 
mid-September, with national expansion expected to follow once the kinks are 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Aucnet is a Japanese company that has been running satellite auctions in Japan 
for about nine years. This is its first U.S. program.

 Software Maintenance Specialists: SMS announced Monday it has signed a 
three-year, $5.5-million agreement with Irvine-based Allergan Inc. to develop a 
decentralized computer network that will eventually link all 4,700 Allergan 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement is meant to help Allergan shift its sales, marketing, accounting 
and personnel operations from a large mainframe system to one using desktop 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Allergan, which had $859 million in revenue last year from sales of specialty 
health care products worldwide, decided to buy the new system after it realized 
its employees were spending as much time retrieving information as they were 
analyzing it, said Mike Lach, vice president for information systems. 
</P>
<P>
 SMS in Santa Ana has about 150 employees, most of whom work at data centers in 
Irvine and La Mirada.

 Dense-Pac Microsystems Inc.: The firm announced Monday it has received a 
$750,000 order from E-Systems, based in Greenville, Tex., for computer memory 
chips that function in rough environments. 
</P>
<P>
 E-Systems will use the chips in its avionics sales, company officials said. 
Deliveries are scheduled over the next 90 days. The chips are ceramic and will 
be used in things like planes, satellites and missiles, where there is too much 
bouncing around to install a hard drive to handle memory needs. 
</P>
<P>
 James Turner, chief executive officer of Dense-Pac, said the order is his 
company's third major one for the chips this quarter, pushing demand higher 
than Dense-Pac had expected.

 Cerplex Group Inc.: The company announced Monday it has bought a technical

founders.

 Cerplex spokesman Bruce Nye declined to say how much the Anaheim-based company

fiscal year. Cerplex does not plan to shift Apex's 53 employees from their 
Washington work site, Nye said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Apex, Cerplex provides electronic repair and parts servicing, but had not 
focused on training until this acquisition. The move will also allow Cerplex to 
offer its services to companies whose computers use the UNIX operating system 
and to begin building a presence in the Pacific Northwest, Nye said.

AGING BABY BOOMERS LOOKING FOR VACATION HOMES; RECREATION: ABOUT 44% OF THE 
1,000 ADULTS POLLED NATIONWIDE SAID THERE WAS A FAIRLY GOOD CHANCE THEY WOULD 
BUY LEISURE-TIME PROPERTY WITHIN A DECADE.

<P>
 As millions of vacationers relax on the beach, hike in the woods or explore 
distant cities, some are also doing serious sightseeing in the vacation housing 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate professionals report a healthy interest in vacation homes this 
summer despite a run-up in interest rates, and many predict steady growth in 
sales over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's balancing it out for our industry is that the demographics are so 
good," said Tom Franks, president of the American Resort & Residential 
Development Assn. "Right now, you're getting the aging baby boomers who are 
entering into the prime buying age for vacation homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their economic success in life is pretty well determined by now. . . . 
They're ready to look." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey by the Washington-based trade group found a rising number of 
households seriously considering such purchases in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 About 44% of the 1,000 adults polled nationwide last year said there was a 
fairly good chance they'd buy recreational property within the next 10 years. 
In a similar 1990 survey, only 26% had such plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the would-be buyers were in the 30- to 40-something age group with 
household incomes of at least $50,000 a year, according to the poll. About half 
believed they would be spending between $25,000 and $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The most desired properties: a two-bedroom unit on the beach, with a home on 
the lake a close second. 
</P>
<P>
 With vacation homes, location is key in determining price, perhaps more so 
than with primary-home property. A small campground site (yes, they do sell 
them) might go for a few thousand dollars, while an oceanfront house can go for 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone would like to overlook the water," said Sandy Walter, a real estate 
agent for Coldwell Banker & Co., at Hilton Head Island, S.C., adding, though 
that "there's a tremendous difference in price between a unit overlooking the 
water and one with a view of the parking lot or trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter noted that a two-bedroom condo on Hilton Head facing the beach might 
sell for $200,000, while the same unit across the hall, sans view, might go for 
$120,000. A two-bedroom unit a few blocks away from the beach would probably 
fetch well under $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 While good deals can be found just about anywhere for those who look hard 
enough, bargains are more prevalent in areas hardest hit by the recession or 
where overbuilding exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of California and the Northeast, for instance, are still recovering from 
a sharp drop in housing prices. 
</P>
<P>
 California realtor Richard J. Rosenthal, who runs Rosenthal & Associates, 
which has offices in Venice Beach and Palm Desert, says newer homes in resort 
areas are maintaining their value, but some of the older ones, particularly 
condo units, are selling for about 25% less than they did in the heyday of the 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors eagerly snapped up condos in the past decade, only to dump them 
later when changes in the tax laws eliminated most of the tax incentives on 
second homes. Still others have had to let their vacation property go because 
of hard economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal has seen the effects of the housing slump firsthand. In 1985, he 
paid $120,000 for a two-bedroom Palm Desert home. This year, he saw a 
three-bedroom unit in the same resort complex sell for $112,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are good opportunities for people to buy well with good financing. As 
an owner you have a problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most financial advisers caution individuals against buying a second home with 
the idea of making money either in the resale or from rental income. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buy it purely for pleasure," advised Jonathan Pond, author of "The New 
Century Family Money Book."  
</P>
<P>
 "The ultimate naivete is to buy property thinking you'll get enough rent to 
carry you through." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts agree that prospective buyers should consider more than just price 
when looking for a second home. For one thing, buyers should stick with 
property that can be reached within a day's drive. They should track local 
economic trends as well. 
</P>
<P>
 While a steady rise in interest rates has had some effect on the market for 
primary homes, several realtors and developers say that has not been the case 
for vacation homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think our buying public is as closely connected to increases in 
interest rates as the first-home buyers," said Jim Perry, a real estate broker 
and owner of Jim Perry and Co. in Kitty Hawk, N.C. "Second homes are a luxury. 
You don't have to have them. Most people who buy them use their discretionary 
income." 
</P>
<P>
 John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Assn. of Realtors, agreed: "A 
good economy will overcome slightly higher interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve had been pushing rates higher since the start of the year 
to help control inflation. Mortgage rates are now about 1.5 percentage points 
higher than last summer, averaging between 8.5% and 8.75%. Tuccillo predicts 
that rates will hold steady through the rest of the year as the economy 
experiences slow, steady growth. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other experts, meanwhile, are forecasting a big demand in vacation 
homes by the next century as baby boomers enter their retirement years. 
(Family-oriented resorts fit for retirement have been steadily springing up 
around the country, according to Franks.) 
</P>
<P>
 That was the reason behind Charles Sigmund's recent purchase of a $230,000 
four-bedroom contemporary house on the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri. Though a 
bit beyond the baby boom age, the St. Louis eye surgeon and his wife, Sharon, 
would someday like to retire at the lake.

FIDELITY SUBSIDIARY ACQUIRES WORLD TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fidelity National Financial Inc., a title insurance underwriter, said Monday 
that its American Title Insurance Co. subsidiary has acquired the operating 
assets of World Title Co.'s operation in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, World Title will now become directly operated by American Title. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Fidelity previously bought 60% of World Tax Service in Brea and 
the operating assets of World Title's operation in Fresno. While Fidelity

EMBASSIES SWEET -- AND SOUR; LIFESTYLES: THE DIPLOMATS WHO LIVE AND WORK ALL 
OVER WASHINGTON, D.C., SPECIALIZE IN RESOLVING INTERNATIONAL CRISES. BUT 
GETTING ALONG WITH THE NEIGHBORS? THAT CAN BE EVEN TRICKIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was moving day at the Russian embassy and a small parade of dullish-blue 
vans lumbered along Massachusetts Avenue, loaded with antique furniture and 
vodka boxes packed with assorted papers and, perhaps, some old secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 After generations in a stately old building purchased by their Czarist 
predecessors near the heart of the capital, Russian diplomats last month 
relocated to the suburbs under the watchful eye of uniformed U.S. Secret 
Service police and neighbors such as Charlotte Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many people in this city, there's still a Cold War being waged with 
embassies and their diplomats," said the Glover Park resident, standing outside 
the new embassy, nicknamed by locals "the Kremlin on the Potomac." 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, look at the buildings, those terrible Soviet-looking things. They 
scar the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the world of diplomatic Washington, where 168 foreign missions 
practice a curious brand of neighborhood diplomacy -- not just with one another 
but with a sometimes-uneasy population of ever-watchful locals. 
</P>
<P>
 On tree-shaded streets and especially along Massachusetts Avenue -- dubbed 
Embassy Row -- diplomatic headquarters sit alongside homes whose owners are 
often miffed over where the diplomats park and how often they mow their lawns, 
and suspicious of just who passes through embassy doors. 
</P>
<P>
 While locals worry about diplomatic immunity run amok and millions in unpaid 
parking-ticket fines amassed by embassies, tourists flock past colorful foreign 
flags so abundant they need a guidebook to decipher them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there's a topsy-turvy geography to Washington's diplomatic landscape. 
Embassies of feuding nations sit side-by-side or just blocks apart. Countries 
that couldn't be farther away on the world map are unlikely neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 El Salvador is a block away from the former Yugoslavia. The Bolivians are next 
door to the British and across from the South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the Austrians rub elbows with the Pakistanis. Cameroon is a neighbor to 
Venezuela. The Israelis are near their former mortal enemies the Egyptians and 
Jordanians -- close enough to borrow a cup of sugar in a pinch. And the 
Zimbabweans -- they're next door to the Washington School of Psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
 Embassies of richer nations such as France, Japan and England have sprawling 
compounds where diplomats host lavish parties, film festivals and cultural 
exhibits for guests including local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Poorer nations, such as Rwanda, Guatemala or Bangladesh, reside in more modest 
properties -- some in multistory brick structures that might have once housed a 
single upper-middle-class family. 
</P>
<P>
 Some embassies are owned, others leased. Most have their offices -- called 
chancelleries -- connected to the ambassador's residence. Newborn nations 
sometimes conduct business from a hotel room or desk in an attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Location is everything, especially in the world of embassies," said Harry W. 
Porter, deputy director of the State Department's Office of Foreign Missions. 
"Most countries strive for the prestige of a respectable address. Others try to 
do business on the cheap. We've had to inform some that the neighborhood 
they've chosen is dangerous, that it's just not a good idea to move there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Until its government changed, the South African embassy held the dubious 
distinction of attracting the most demonstrators. After President Nelson 
Mandela was elected, the anti-apartheid protesters were invited as honored 
guests to his Inauguration Day celebration here. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadians have perhaps the choicest site in Washington -- a Pennsylvania 
Avenue address with sweeping views of the city. Iran's ramshackle embassy has 
been abandoned for more than a decade, since its diplomats were banished after 
a mob takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Israelis -- they're known for security. No one enters without an 
appointment -- especially after the bombing of an Israeli embassy building in 
London and a Jewish social services center in Buenos Aires last month. "Inside 
this building," said one worker, "you are in the safest place in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 While uneasiness separates some Middle Eastern diplomats, Israeli, Bahraini, 
Jordanian and Egyptian embassy workers eat lunch together at a tiny park near 
their chancelleries. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all relationships are so courtly. On Massachusetts Avenue, where 
chancelleries are packed tighter than summer tourists on a subway ride, tempers 
often flare. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, when a car bomb killed former Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier at 
Sheridan Circle, the noise and flying shrapnel startled diplomats in the nearby 
embassies of Greece and Turkey, bitter antagonists. Each embassy reported to 
the State Department that it was under attack by the other. And the Israeli 
chancellor, traveling in a car near the bomb site, feared he was a target of a 
Palestinian attack. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Washingtonians are growing more suspicious of immunity enjoyed by 
foreign diplomats. While embassies are not exactly considered foreign soil, 
they're the next closest thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're inviolate," Porter said. "That means anyone on the property is a 
guest -- even local police. Embassies have sometimes not allowed firemen on the 
premises even to fight a fire." 
</P>
<P>
 There are now 2,700 diplomats and 5,700 of their dependents living in the 
Washington area -- in addition to 4,000 staffers and their 5,000 dependents. 
All have been granted full criminal immunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 20 serious crimes were committed by some of the 19,500 foreign 
embassy and consulate personnel nationwide. In Washington, those offenses 
included arson, burglary, sexual assault, thefts and weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecution is nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "In cases where a U.S. citizen is a victim, we seek an explanation from the 
embassy," said one senior State Department official. "But with full immunity, a 
diplomat may not have to cooperate. So, in theory, he could get away with rape, 
or worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Such immunity makes many locals wary: "I have a rule never to cross the street 
in front of a car with diplomatic plates," said Dupont Circle resident Anna 
Campos. "If they hit you, they're going to bolt for home. It's the first thing 
you learn in this town." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parking is another sore spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats receive hundreds of parking tickets each year -- and ignore most of 
them. Through last fall, foreign embassies had amassed more than $6.5 million 
in unpaid citations in recent years, prompting a public outcry. 
</P>
<P>
 Embassy employees are technically required to pay fines, but nothing happens 
if they don't: Cars with diplomatic plates cannot be booted or impounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians are the worst offenders, accounting for three-quarters of 
diplomatic parking tickets, more than $2.5 million worth in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once in a blue moon a Russian diplomat will pay for a ticket," Porter said. 
"And you know how often blue moons occur." 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, the city council passed an ordinance to block embassies 
from moving into residential neighborhoods, but Congress overturned it. 
</P>
<P>
 Embattled embassies will often try to smooth ruffled relations with neighbors 
over parking, noise and land-use issues. "Embassies have learned to be good 
neighbors because resident groups can be vocal," Porter said. "They really get 
after them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Turks have been in court for several years over an embassy renovation job. 
And the Italians, planning to build a new embassy in wooded Rock Creek Park, 
have thrown parties for locals worried about the site's deforestation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schmoozing neighbors," Porter said, "is part of the job -- they are, after 
all, diplomats." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For many foreign diplomats, however, Washington can be a lonely assignment -- 
years spent in a far-flung post with little feel for local customs or events 
unfolding back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day of the 1991 coup in our country was a very lonely day here," said 
Russian counselor Vladimir Pechatnov. "All we could do was watch the television 
and wonder if we had a home to return to anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Boniface Karani, a counselor at the Rwandan embassy, still has nightmares over 
the civil war in his country. "Often, you are out of the loop in Washington," 
he said. "I have friends and family members who may not be alive anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Rwandan embassy, high school students from Kansas City shouted 
questions at the teen-age daughters of a diplomat sitting on the front steps: 
"Why all the killing and violence?" they asked. "Why isn't anything being 
done?" 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, standing next to a three-foot-tall stuffed Rwandan gorilla and a 
collection of tribal spears, Karani said, "You Americans had your own Civil War 
and you fought until the matter was settled -- no outsiders got involved. Give 
us the same chance to settle things without outside intervention." 
</P>
<P>
 (Several days later, President Clinton announced that the United States would 
no longer recognize the Rwandan government, and all diplomats were vacated from 
the embassy.) 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the Russians tell the real tale of changing embassy life: For 
years, they represented the very image of the unwanted, mistrusted outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, the Soviets purchased a 10-acre former Veterans Administration 
hospital on a hill overlooking the capital. The deal was criticized by 
politicians who claimed the snoopy Soviets might intercept sensitive 
intelligence transmissions from their perch. 
</P>
<P>
 The moving day was delayed for decades, most recently in retaliation over 
Washington's concerns that a new U.S. embassy in Moscow was riddled with 
intelligence bugs. In 1992, the Russians were finally given the go-ahead to 
make the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other former Soviet republics, the Russians say they want to put their 
secretive pasts behind them. Still, counselor Pechatnov says he will miss the 
16th Street chancellery -- a secret-soaked old building that saw years of 
intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
 "These walls," he said, "have many stories to tell."

THIGH ANXIETY; IT'S AN OBSESSION. THINK WE'RE OVERSTATING THE CASE? WELL, IN 
1994 SALES OF 'REDUCING CREAMS' COULD TOP $90 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE KNOWLTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind the calm exterior of millions of seemingly sane American women lurks a 
raging obsession so severe it clouds all common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called "thigh anxiety" -- that fear and worry about the current or future 
terrain of one's upper gams, their total land mass, their wrinkles and dimples, 
their bumps and lumps and cottage-cheese ripples. 
</P>
<P>
 Thigh anxiety knows few boundaries, striking women of all locales, sizes and 
races, in many cases exceeding concern with breasts, knees, tummies, waists, 
buttocks or turkey necks. (Men either don't care or don't get it.) 
</P>
<P>
 And if you think this thing is imagined, guess again -- industry insiders say 
thigh cream sales for this year will top $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Another shocking figure: Thighs account for about one-fourth of a woman's body 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenna Matthews, a UC Berkeley research associate who has written three books 
about the politics of being female, says it's usually at about age 30 that 
thigh jitters fully storm in. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Matthews: "It's terrifying to see flabby thighs appear because of the 
weight they carry in the rest of a woman's world. It instills rage and 
anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
 And Matthews says Californians are among the leaders of this thundering thigh 
herd. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in California that youth and physical beauty are social markers and 
entrees," she says. "They take the place of family connections, what prep 
school you went to and economic status. This creates a democracy for those who 
are sufficiently good-looking, but it also creates heightened anxiety about the 
decay of physical beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of Lisa, 42, a 5-foot, 7-inch, 122-pound mother of two who on 
many accounts has everything going for her -- everything, she says, except her 
thighs. 
</P>
<P>
 She's embarrassed to admit it, and asked that her last name be withheld, but 
the reality is that she's had a three-phased thigh liposuction, walks with hand 
weights an hour each day, eats with fat-free thighs in mind, employs a personal 
trainer and dabs on thigh cream called Inches Away -- which she also sells via 
a multilevel marketing company -- once or twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made it a lifetime study -- these thighs," she says, adding that she's a 
transplanted New Yorker, and "suffered there as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Are hers thunder thighs? Have men shunned her saddlebags? 
</P>
<P>
 No. Lisa's childhood was happy, she's always been able to attract men and 
she's a Size 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you saw me in a long skirt with a belt at the waist, you'd think I was 
extra thin," she says. "But if you saw me in a bathing suit, you'd say 'poor 
thing.' It's my thighs -- they're bigger than they should be. My thighs have a 
life of their own." 
</P>
<P>
 She sighs. "I know that at the age of 42 I should've accepted the fact I don't 
have great thighs, but I can't. It's always in the back of my mind that I 
haven't done enough, that someday I'll figure out the secret and my thighs will 
go away." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Marla Miller Mazura, a Newport Beach society columnist in her 
40s. She's of "normal weight" and considers herself a feminist, but she still 
worries about her thighs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't help myself," she says. "It's the only part of my body that I've ever 
worried about." 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because they're exposed, she says. "I've always been obsessed about my 
thighs because my mother always said the legs are the last to go. I like my 
legs and I want to keep liking them." 
</P>
<P>
 She laughs. "I look at other people and compare (thigh) dimples," she says, 
segueing into a story about the time she saw actress Geena Davis on a 
late-night talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 "There she was with her perfect lips and her beautiful face. She sits down in 
this gorgeous white mini-dress, crosses her legs and there were her dimples. At 
12 o'clock midnight, I was thrilled." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Biologically speaking, fat distribution in women is concentrated in the upper 
arms, hips, breasts and thighs, whereas in men, extra fat tends to settle in 
the abdomen and scalp areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Katch, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Michigan, says 
for an average woman who weighs 125 pounds, 22.8% of her body weight is in her 
thighs. 
</P>
<P>
 So why was Mother Nature so generous with women's thighs? 
</P>
<P>
 "We can invent all kinds of reasons," says Prof. Emeritus Stanley M. Garn, a 
University of Michigan physical anthropologist and nutritionist. "One is that 
fat storage is useful for nursing children," he says. "But we may be throwing 
an invalid explanation at the data." 
</P>
<P>
 He adds: "Peak lean body mass is at age 25. After that, supportive tissue 
decreases. Then again, I know people in their 50s who (then) drop like a tweed 
suit that's been washed." 
</P>
<P>
 He attributes worry about fat thighs to self-obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Narcissism enables people to spend an inordinate amount of time trying to 
have more or less fat or move it around," he says. "You're with yourself around 
24 hours a day . . . for people who don't have other things to do, it's a 
natural to put (focus) on this." 
</P>
<P>
 He stresses that our cultural obsession with fat is nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Garn: "It was far more intense in the '20s. Look at what the flapper was 
supposed to look like. The acme was to look like you could take a shower in a 
fountain pen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thigh anxiety isn't news to Dr. Guillermo D. Castillo, an Illinois cosmetic 
surgeon and trustee for the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indeed yes, this thigh-size thing is a large consideration as most women 
dislike their upper thighs," he says. "The culprit in females is saddlebags, 
the prominence you find on the outside of the thigh." 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo says liposuction helps only if a patient is less than 20% above ideal 
body weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very frequently, the patient says 'I don't care what it costs, do it,' " he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 At what cost this surgical beauty? At between $2,500 and $5,000, thigh 
liposuction is expensive, and not without side effects and risks, Castillo 
acknowledges. (Temporary numbness, pain, swelling, bruising and discoloration 
are considered normal after the procedure.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lesley Seymour, Glamour magazine's senior editor for beauty, thinks women 
should be more accepting of their thighs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are we embarrassed, mortified, trying to erase it and hide it? The 
aesthetic should not have so much pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, if they're out of shape, flabby, if you eat nothing but fat all day and 
get no exercise, that's something to worry about. But I think we have to change 
our thinking." 
</P>

 She brings up the new and burgeoning thigh cream industry, which in a short 
time has produced one of the most frenzied sales battles in cosmetic history. 
(And who could forget the Thighmaster?) 
</P>
<P>
 Now being advertised in newspapers, magazines, bulletin boards and bus 
benches, the products are under investigation by the Federal Drug 
Administration to see if they should be regulated as a cosmetic or a drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if everyone in the world is coming out with one thigh cream after 
another," Seymour says. "It's sad that we're so obsessed." 
</P>
<P>
 Her best advice to the thigh-minded: Workouts, says Seymour, who admits to 
having some thigh anxiety of her own and regularly uses thigh machines at her 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thighs," she says, "are one area that really does respond to exercise."

BODY WATCH; AN EYE ON SAFETY; GOGGLES COULD PREVENT 90% OF THE 100,000 EYE 
INJURIES THAT OCCUR EACH YEAR. BUT MOST KIDS WORRY MORE ABOUT HOW THEY LOOK 
THAN ABOUT HOW THEY SEE.

 Stevie Korey celebrated his ninth birthday with family and 25 buddies at a 
restaurant equipped with a batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stevie's turn at bat was over, the pitching machine threw an extra ball 
at his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was wearing a helmet, his eye was unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later he had eye surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, two years later, his retina is held together artificially with a sclera 
buckle, he sees small balls of light and his peripheral vision is diminished. 
The Highland Park, Ill., boy is subject to vision problems for the rest of his 
life including glaucoma and cataracts. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, reports his mom, Shelley, "Stevie wears polycarbonate goggles for 
all sports activities now." As does his brother, Jeff -- the Korey boys are 
ambassadors of eye protection for Prevent Blindness America -- and a lot of 
their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the exception. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, more than 100,000 eye 
injuries occur annually during sports or recreational activities, and 90% of 
them could have been prevented. Yet, many athletes -- amateur and professional 
alike -- don't wear eye protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not enough awareness out there," Shelley Korey says. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, eye doctors are touting sports goggles with lenses made of 
polycarbonate, a shatterproof plastic found in jet canopies and bullet-proof 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Polycarbonate goggles are the recommended form of safety glass and do the 
best job in protecting eyes from sports injuries," says Dr. Ronald E. Smith, 
professor of ophthalmology and chairman, Department of Ophthalmology at 
USC/Doheny Eye Institute and President of American Academy of Ophthalmology. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries to unprotected eyes can range from a simple black eye to blindness. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda French, a member of the 1992 U.S. Olympics badminton team, recently 
learned about the advantages of goggles: safety and performance.  
</P>
<P>
 "A birdie can get up to 200 miles per hour so with goggles I'm not as nervous. 
They're not attractive. I look like a bug. That's why nobody considers wearing 
them but I think they're really good." 
</P>
<P>
 Says French's eye doctor, Dr. Carl Hillier: "If you have goggles on, you know 
your eyes aren't going to be injured so you don't have to blink or lose eye 
contact with the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Hillier drives home the point to his young patients and their parents by 
letting the parents pound lenses with a sledgehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't break. End of discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 Persuading children to wear goggles, however, proves tougher, Hillier says. 
"It's embarrassing for a little kid to put on safety goggles. Other kids make 
fun of them. Safety is almost secondary to interest kids in wearing goggles." 
</P>
<P>
 Same goes for bigger kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Lakers trainer Gary Vitti: "We can encourage (players) to wear goggles, 
but you can't make them wear them. The only guys who do wear them are the guys 
with eye injuries -- they get a little gun-shy and wear them. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of years ago, (Laker) James Worthy, myself, and a sunglass 
manufacturer designed the goggle that is most predominantly worn in the NBA 
right now. They go around the cheekbone and are sanded on the bottom so it 
doesn't rip the skin. As for fogging, we drilled holes in the plastic at the 
side of the nose and that worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Some athletes resist eye protection even after they've been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauli Ramirez of San Diego broke his cheek and orbital bone on a fullback's 
knee during a rugby match in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my eyeball finally fully opened, I didn't like the looks of things. The 
eye wasn't fully moving. Inside the whole eye was totally red. The vision was 
weird, blurred," Ramirez says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after two hours of surgery and his vision restored (though he still has 
some blurriness), he won't wear goggles because, he says, he likes to keep his 
rugby uniform simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just wear jersey, shirts, socks and rugby boots and there's no 
restrictions with helmets. A lot of times gear like that restricts you." 
Besides, Ramirez adds, "I think plastic goggles would hurt someone during a 
tackle." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John B. Jeffers, team ophthalmologist for the Philadelphia 76ers and the 
Eagles, says, "Part of the problem is, it is assumed to be not macho, 'Not my 
style,' even after they already get the eye injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Former Laker star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) wore goggles because he was hit in 
the eyes so much from fingers. He'd been scratched so many times that if he 
rubbed his eye the cement, the surface of the eye, could literally scrape off. 
(Abdul-Jabbar) did make it easier for me to recommend to at least kids to wear 
goggles and the old four-eyes (image) kind of got diluted." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar knows that most youngsters balk about wearing eye protection and 
he has some words of encouragement for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly kept my career on line. If I hadn't worn goggles, I would've 
retired early. My face was right in the area where people were swinging at the 
ball. First time in pro I was hurt so bad I lashed out in pain and broke my 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the 'lone ranger' out there," Abdul-Jabbar says. "I started wearing 
goggles 20 years ago and nobody was wearing them then. People would mention it 
but nobody ridiculed me. I remember a couple of times I could hear the click of 
somebody's nails on my glasses and I knew I was doing the right thing. Tell 
kids don't worry what other people think about that (goggles). Your eyes are 
crucial to your life. Kids have to protect their vision." 
</P>
<P>
 Papa has spoken. There'll be no more discussing it now, kids. Hazards for Your 
Eyes 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the most common sports eye injuries: 
</P>
<P>
 * corneal abrasions (scratches) 
</P>
<P>
 * vitreous hemorrhage 
</P>
<P>
 * ocular lacerations 
</P>
<P>

MYTHBUSTERS: BODY WATCH; WALKING WON'T DO IT, BUT THERE ARE LABOR-INDUCERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You may have heard it through the grapevine, from a reliable source or even 
from the office know-it-all. 
</P>
<P>
 As you're listening to this homespun health information, you nod and think, 
"Yes. That makes sense." Later, you wonder: True or false? 
</P>
<P>
 Here, experts debunk some common myths and give at least a partial blessing to 
some others. 
</P>
<P>
 * Physical activity such as walking will help induce labor when a woman is 
near her due date. 
</P>
<P>
 False. "Once in labor, walking can help speed things along," says Dr. Irwin 
Frankel, obstetrician/gynecologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and USC 
clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology. "But it won't induce it." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a woman is "on the cusp of labor," as Frankel puts it, there are two 
physical activities that will make it more likely: "sexual intercourse and/or 
pulling on the nipples." 
</P>
<P>
 "Pulling on the nipples induces uterine contractions by secretion of the 
body's own Pitocin (a hormone called oxytocin). Ejaculate from the male has 
prostaglandins. One theory is prostaglandins induces contractions as a woman 
gets closer to the due date, when there is increasing sensitivity of the 
uterine muscles to these agents." 
</P>
<P>
 * Clicking sounds in the knee are nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually true, says Dr. Jim Fox, orthopedic surgeon at the Southern California 
Orthopedic Institute, Van Nuys. "There are many reasons for clicking. Usually 
it's due to a muscle imbalance or the knee cap momentarily not fitting in the 
groove. As long as there is no pain, swelling or limitation of movement, it's 
probably nothing to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto for popping sounds, which Fox says are harmless 99% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Crunching sounds are a different matter, however. "Crunching means there's 
wear and tear on a bone surface. And that usually means there is 
deterioration." Seeing a doctor to investigate further is wise, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * As you age, it takes longer to stop the bleeding when a cut occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 True -- and false. 
</P>
<P>
 "One will bleed more easily and longer if taking aspirin," such as those 
taking it on a long-term basis to minimize stroke and heart disease risk, says 
Dr. Irving Ackerman, an internist at Kaiser Permanente, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The skin gets thinner as we get older so less (traumatic) injury can break a 
blood vessel," he says. "The blood vessels become closer to the surface. People 
seem to bruise more easily. But the body's clotting mechanism is the same. In 
routine surgery, for instance, elderly people don't necessarily bleed more than 
younger people. 
</P>
<P>
 "As one gets older, other diseases, such as kidney disease, can change the 
blood-clotting ability. But in healthy elderly folks, it should remain the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 * Sleeping with makeup on makes your face break out. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly.  
</P>
<P>
 "The pores get clogged with makeup (and) bacteria," says Dr. Carl Korn, a 
Sherman Oaks dermatologist. "Microorganisms will set up housekeeping. You might 
see a rash and pimples."

DOWNTIME: BODY WATCH; DANCES WITH COYOTES AND DEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I run trails in the canyons in the Santa Monica mountains.I've run into bees, 
poison oak and rattlesnakes. I have seen hawks, rabbits, coyotes, deer and 
bobcats. I know the canyons turn green, then gold, then brown, year after year, 
and I have seen them turn black after fire. I have learned to hear my 
footsteps, to listen to my breathing. There is a rhythm in the trail and in me. 
We're a dance.

R S V P / INTO THE NIGHT: THOSE WITH AN APPETITE FOR ALL THINGS COUNTRY

 The scene: A celebrity- and rhinestone-studded gala opening of the Country 
Star Hollywood restaurant, newest addition to Universal Studios CityWalk, on 
Sunday evening. Around 500 guests were present, and everybody's favorite faux 
street was jammed with around 300 onlookers to watch another musical genre go 
the theme-restaurant route. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an American dream," said Country Star CEO and Chairman Robert Schuster, 
whose soon-to-be chain of multimedia- and memorabilia-packed restaurants is, by 
the way, a publicly traded corporation. "I had a concept and I could go to Wall 
Street and actually raise money to produce this. I don't know where else this 
could happen, where somebody could put together a project based on a good 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who was there: The fete was emceed by The Nashville Network hosts Lorianne 
Crook and Charlie Chase. Country music guests included "celebrity 
representatives" Vince Gill, Reba McEntire and Wynonna, plus Loretta Lynn, Buck 
Owens and Dwight Yoakam. Other glitterati -- drawn from elsewhere along the 
entertainment spectrum -- included Gary Busey, Gary Coleman, Ronny Cox, Dana 
Delany, Wayne Gretzky, Linda Kozlowski, Little Richard, Joanne Pakula, Wink 
Martindale, "Models Inc." star Cameron Daddo, Forrest Gump's Mykelti 
Williamson, Motley Crue's Vince Neil, and the Del Rubio Triplets. 
</P>
<P>
 But upstaging them all, and drawing the most enthusiastic response from the 
otherwise tepid outside crowd was the appearance of 
criminal-attorney-to-the-stars Robert Shapiro, dressed in an embroidered 
Western shirt and snakeskin boots, with wife and kids in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: A buffet big enough to sate the heartiest country appetites -- ribs, 
steak, chicken, chili and salads. Waiters cruised the tightly packed party with 
trays of fajitas, coconut fried chicken and corn bread. Thirsts were amply 
slaked at the open bar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I've loved country music since I was a kid," said rock's elder 
statesman, Little Richard, who skipped the Stetson and boots in favor of a 
flamboyant print shirt. "You got to remember that '56 rock 'n' roll is what 
country music is today. All that rock 'n' roll is country music to this 
generation."

 The premiere of Kenneth Branagh's "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" on Nov. 1 is 
among the highlights of the two-month UK/LA 1994 festival schedule to be 
announced by British Consul General Merrick Baker-Bates and festival organizers 
at a press conference today at the Biltmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 During the festival, Prince Charles will visit Los Angeles to attend UK/LA and 
other events related to fund-raising for Los Angeles inner-city charities, 
according to the consul general. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening UK/LA 1994 event, Sept. 7 at the Hollywood Bowl, is a performance 
by Manchester's Halle Orchestra, conducted by its music director, California 
native Kent Nagano. Following a Sept. 6 preview concert, on Sept. 7 the 
orchestra will perform a salute to British film music featuring William 
Walton's score for Laurence Olivier's "Henry V," with a guest narrator to be 
named later. 
</P>
<P>
 First announced in April, the festival will include more than 40 Los Angeles 
cultural organizations, involving 370 artists in a half-dozen artistic 
disciplines presented in 46 venues from Santa Monica to Pomona, festival 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-event festival also includes: the first Prince's Trust Concert in the 
United States, with pop stars to be announced and proceeds to benefit youth 
charities here and in Britain; performances by both the Royal National Theatre 
and the Royal Shakespeare Company; the West Coast debut of Stomp, a "theater of 
sound"; "3x3: Great Solo Performances," featuring Lynn Redgrave, British 
character actress Miriam Margolyes and Steven Berkoff, perhaps best known in 
Los Angeles for his long-running play, "Kvetch"; the Academy of St. Martin in 
the Fields with its famed conductor, Sir Neville Marriner, and a five-night 
orgy of Monty Python films and television programs, with promised appearances 
by Python members. 
</P>
<P>
 British-born L.A. resident David Hockney's design for the poster and program 
brochure also will be unveiled today, a color-laser copy of a gouache and 
computer drawing with felt marker. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival officially ends Nov. 14, although some art exhibitions presented 
under the festival umbrella will continue into 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1988 UK/LA festival primarily featured mainstream arts and performers. 
This time, Bruce Joseph, UK/LA's executive director, stressed that the programs 
reflect the variety of cultures in the British Isles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to dispel the preconceived notions so many Americans have of the 
United Kingdom -- that it's bobbies, beefeaters, double-deck buses and 
Shakespeare. . . . It's very much a multiracial, multicultural society," Joseph 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances include the a cappella women's group Black Voices; a seminar on 
black British cinema; performances by Leeds' Phoenix Dance Company, which 
features British artists of Afro-Caribbean descent; Spanish and English 
performances of "The Merchant of Venice" by Will & Company, and a collaboration 
between the Glasgow Print Studio and Self-Help Graphics of East Los Angeles. 
</P>

ENJOYING HIS JUGGLING ACT; 'HOME'S' THOMAS FINDS TIME FOR SERIOUS WORK AND PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE BERGMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a rehearsal day on the set of "Home Improvement," and Jonathan Taylor 
Thomas, who plays Randy, the middle son, has in a matter of minutes sung 
several versions of the Albanian national anthem, grabbed a cable and cracked 
it like a whip, circled the set at high speed about a dozen times -- and still 
hit his marks and his lines perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes time for the energetic, soon-to-be 13-year-old to take a 
break for an interview, Thomas manages to sit still for at least 20 minutes. 
After all, he's got plenty to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh off his triumph as the voice of young Simba in Disney's "The Lion King," 
Thomas is back to serve up wisecracks on the fourth season of ABC's top-rated 
series while still unpacking from his recent trip to Vancouver, where he filmed 
"Man 2 Man" with Chevy Chase and Farrah Fawcett. His first live-action movie 
role required him to miss the premiere of "The Lion King" and a huge chunk of 
his summer vacation, but don't call the labor department yet -- for, just as he 
does on the set, Thomas found time this summer to have some fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a chance to go fishing,"Thomas explains. "When I got into this 
business, my mom was worried that I wouldn't have enough free time to be a kid, 
so there's always a balance of work and play." 
</P>
<P>
 While "Man 2 Man," in which he plays an 11-year-old trying to scare off a 
potential stepfather, took up the summer, it took Thomas a year and a half to 
record his part in "The Lion King," shuttling back and forth from the "Home 
Improvement" set to the recording studio, both located on the Disney lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his TV taping schedule, he often had to record his lines by 
himself, which he acknowledges was difficult, a stark contrast to his ensemble 
work on "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to having all these other actors and actresses around," Thomas says. 
"In this case I didn't. I was there in a room alone and I had to not only play 
my character, but the person I was talking to. I had to get inside their head 
so I could know what Simba would be reacting to." 
</P>
<P>
 While there are huge differences between putting together an animated feature 
and a television sitcom, Thomas saw similarities between his two characters: 
"Simba and Randy are both very curious kids, they're intuitive and confident, 
always ready to throw that fast one in, that little comment." 
</P>
<P>
 And if you look closely at young Simba, you'll see that the lion cub shares 
some of Thomas' physical features -- especially that sly smile. Disney's 
animators videotaped Thomas as he recorded his performance and incorporated 
many of his facial expressions into those of the lion cub. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas hasn't let the roaring success of "The Lion King," nor the fact that he 
receives five big boxes of fan mail a week for "Home Improvement," go to his 
head. He chooses his friends carefully because "you have to make sure they're 
not just friends with you because of who you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who enters the seventh grade this fall, maintains straight A's while 
taking courses in an accelerated program for gifted children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep my grades up because you never know how your acting career is going to 
go," he says, offering his theory on what he calls "the Child Actor Syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have these kid actors who grew up and a bunch of years later they're on 
'Geraldo' crying that they never had any time, that they were totally corrupted 
by this business. Probably most of them didn't have much to fall back on," he 
says. "It's easy to get twisted around in this crazy business." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas credits his mother, Claudine, with whom he lives in Los Angeles along 
with his 17-year-old brother, for keeping him on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
 Of her son, Claudine Thomas says, "He's definitely bright, but I think you 
have to be bright in this business to juggle everything, to keep things 
balanced." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas is articulate on a range of topics, from the importance of soccer to 
Brazilian culture, to the merits of Carnegie-Mellon University's business 
program, to the beauty of the Seychelles, islands off the coast of Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 If the young man sounds too perfect, stand in line. "I kept waiting to see the 
flaw," says James Orr, who co-wrote and directed "Man 2 Man." "I kept looking 
for it, and I swear to God, I couldn't find it in 10 weeks worth of shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 As to why he cast Thomas, Orr says, "He radiates this intelligence and 
dimension, and not only does he have this great comic timing, but he has this 
depth of emotion. He's comfortable in his own skin, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas isn't sure he wants to continue to act into his adult years. "Show 
business is something that I'm pretty familiar with," he says, "but I think I 
want to write, direct and basically do it all."  
</P>
<P>
 "So you want to be a Renaissance man?" he's asked. Thomas laughs. "Yeah," he 
says, "that sounds good."

FUND-RAISING STAFF QUITS LAGUNA ART MUSEUM; GALLERIES: ALL THREE MEMBERS OF THE 
INSTITUTION'S DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT HAVE RESIGNED RECENTLY, CITING DIFFERENT 
REASONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All three members of Laguna Art Museum's fund-raising department, including 
its director, have resigned in recent weeks, each after working there less than 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The departing staffers, who cited different reasons for leaving, are: Marilyn 
(Mickey) Shaw, director of the development department; Karla Fields, membership 
coordinator; and Joy Sabado, special events coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, who begins a similar job on Sept. 1 with the March of Dimes Births 
Defects Foundation, Orange County Chapter, said Monday that she started looking 
for a new job shortly after the museum last spring fired former director 
Charles Desmarais, who had recruited her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's common for the director of development (at any museum) to have a strong 
working relationship with the (museum) director," Shaw said, "and the new 
director will probably want to (hire) his or her own development director." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sabado said she resigned in late July to accept her current job as publicity 
and promotions manager at Senior Highlights, a senior citizens' newspaper 
published in Laguna Hills. Before joining the museum, Sabado worked with Shaw 
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, where Shaw coordinated corporate 
and foundation relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields, who could not be reached, left in part to have a baby, museum board 
president Teri Kennady said, adding that she doesn't expect that the 
resignations will make it more difficult to hire a new museum director. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fund-raising at any nonprofit organization "is an extremely tough" activity, 
Kennady said. The museum's development department has "had a high turnover in 
the last four or five years," she said, but that that "goes with the 
territory." 
</P>
<P>
 The board hopes to combat the situation through greater cohesiveness between 
the historically isolated development department and the rest of the museum, 
she said, and by offering new development staffers such incentives as 
opportunities to attend more professional conventions and lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 "This turnover is not new," Shaw said, "but it has to be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's acting director, Susan M. Anderson, has been interviewing 
candidates for the membership and special-events coordinator jobs, Kennady 
said. A new development director will not be hired until Desmarais' replacement 
is brought on "by the end of the year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said the lack of a museum director "made it extremely difficult" to raise 
funds for the museum, but that it is problem common to any nonprofit 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential supporters "are looking to the director for leadership and strength 
of management," Shaw said.

THE WEEK AHEAD: PALE; REFERENDUM IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Undaunted by mounting pressure to end their siege of Bosnia, Serb nationalist 
rebels will vote in a referendum in Pale, outside Sarajevo, and other 
rebel-held territory in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday and Sunday to underscore 
their leadership's rejection of an international peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A decisive popular vote against the proposal, which would split Bosnian 
territory between the rebel Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led government, seems 
certain.Serb leaders fear a war-crimes tribunal could be ordered once the 
conflict ends, so anti-settlement propaganda has been fierce. 
</P>
<P>
 The more nebulous question is where defiance will lead the Bosnian Serbs. 
Their obstinacy is undermining an alliance with Serbian leaders in the rump 
Yugoslavia and strengthening support for lifting an international arms embargo 
that has shackled the Bosnian government.

WORLD VIEW; THE FUSE STILL SIZZLES ON WORLD POPULATION BOMB; INDIA IS 
EMBLEMATIC. IT LOWERED FERTILITY RATES, BUT THE NUMBERS KEEP GROWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost half a century after the first alert about the Earth's swelling 
population, humankind has entered a critical transition. And no place is more 
representative of the change than Bombay, which doubles as India's wealthiest 
city and home to Asia's largest slum, the notorious Dharavi. 
</P>
<P>
 Dharavi, a former garbage dump, has been blanketed by almost a million 
squatters fleeing the poverty of rural India. Hundreds more arrive weekly to 
live in the stinking squalor of tattered burlap and rag huts, with no access to 
running water or electricity and only one public toilet for every few dozen 
families. Women rely on a polluted marsh for cleaning. Barefoot, ill-clad tots 
play in dusty alleys. Many of their preteen siblings are already scrambling for 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Dharavi symbolizes teeming India, now expected to crack the 1-billion 
population level by the year 2000 -- and then to surpass China as the world's 
most populous country by 2035. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Bombay also reflects a changing India. The world's oldest official 
family-planning program, headquartered in the bustling port city, is estimated 
to have helped India avert at least 90 million births -- equivalent to the 
population of Mexico -- since the 1950s through a mix of voluntary and coercive 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the 21st Century nears, India is a microcosm of the world, with both 
good news and bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made enormous progress in the use of family-planning methods around the 
world. Over the past 30 years, use of birth control in developing countries has 
increased from 10% of couples to about 55%," said Dr. J. Joseph Speidel, 
president of Population Action International (PAI), a nonprofit research 
organization in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average number of children per woman has declined from six to 3.6 -- more 
than half the distance to a two-child family," he said. An average of 2.1 
children per woman is considered replacement level -- or zero growth. 
</P>
<P>
 In India, traditional patterns are shifting significantly. Birth control is 
now used by 45% of married couples. In Bombay, the practice of birth control 
has increased in five years from 40% to 56% of couples, according to U.N. 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 These breakthroughs do not, however, mean a decline in the number of the 
Earth's inhabitants. "Absolute growth" is still adding ever-greater numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad news is that the number of young people entering childbearing years 
is so large that the absolute size of world population is growing. The yearly 
increase in population has risen from 75 million in 1969 to 93 million today," 
Speidel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after fertility rates fall, absolute increases continue through a whole 
life cycle, or about 70 years -- a phenomenon called "population momentum." So 
the world is still a long way from stabilizing its numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite India's declining fertility rate, for example, its population doubled 
from 342 million to 685 million in 34 years -- between 1947 and 1981. Less than 
13 years later, it has reached 897 million, or almost triple the 1947 total, 
according to PAI. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are taking a mounting toll on quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bombay is a city built for 2 million trying to cope with 12 million and faced 
with up to 16 million by 2000," said Avadia Wadia, who founded India's Family 
Planning Assn. in 1951 and is the leader of India's population movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "A half-century ago these avenues were full of blossoming trees, and we had 
beautiful beaches. Now there aren't many trees left, and over half the 
population lives in slums. And compared with some of them, Dharavi is almost a 
showcase." 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the U.N. Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, 
which is scheduled for Sept. 5-13, U.N. experts offer three predictions about 
how the so-called "demographic transition" will end. 
</P>
<P>
 * The best-case scenario is a uniform worldwide decline to 1.9 births per 
family, lower than replacement level. World population would then increase from 
today's 5.6 billion to a peak of 8 billion in 2050, and then decline to 5.6 
billion by 2150. 
</P>
<P>
 * The medium scenario is a slower decline to replacement-level fertility, 
stabilizing population at 11.5 billion people, more than double current 
numbers, by 2150. 
</P>
<P>
 * The worst-case scenario is a continuation of current reduced fertility rates 
but no further declines. By 2150, the world would then have 694 billion people 
-- 124 times today's total. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst case is staggering because humankind took untold millennia to reach 
its first billion in 1800. And it is even more daunting because it doesn't 
allow for a small lapse to previous fertility patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact on some countries would be devastating long before 2150. India 
already squeezes 16% of the world's people onto 2.4% of the Earth's land. 
Without further inroads in slowing growth rates, its population will triple 
again over the next half-century, according to PAI figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the best case, even if birthrates are on a continuous drop, we're 
going to add a billion people every 10 or 11 years well into the next century," 
said Carl Haub, demographer at the Population Reference Bureau, a private 
research organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we bring the numbers down, we will face economic, development and 
health problems of a magnitude that we don't know yet. Many developing 
countries won't be able to deal with them. And the developed world won't be 
able to bail them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three scenarios, the second is now most likely, demographers predict, 
due to changes in both the problem and responses to it since the first summit 
of experts in Rome in 1954 drew attention to what became known as the 
"population bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 One basic change since then is that population is no longer framed solely in 
terms of teeming masses of new babies. Of growing importance is the older 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since India attained its independence in 1947, for example, average life 
expectancy in the country -- which mirrors statistics in the developing world 
-- has increased from 32 to 59 years, said Wadia, the Bombay population 
authority. Improved living conditions and health care in the 20th Century have 
effectively produced a whole new generation at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 India, with more than 54 million, and China have the world's largest 
populations over 60. Wadia is herself over 80. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is declining mortality, not rising fertility, that is causing the current 
population surge. Over the past 40 years, fertility rates have fallen in most 
parts of the world. But because death rates have dropped even more steeply, the 
absolute number of births has gone up," said Laurie Ann Mazur, editor of 
"Beyond the Numbers," a new anthology on population. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past four decades, life expectancy has increased from 66 to 75 years in 
wealthy countries. By 2030, the worldwide average will rise to 72 years, while 
the average person in some developed countries will live well into the 80s, 
according to the World Bank. And living beyond 100 will not be unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 But new issues can in turn create new complications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems of an aging society include housing, economic support and health 
care. As people live longer, society requires a different type of medical care 
and medicines," said M. Faith Mitchell, senior State Department coordinator for 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Developing regions will be most challenged. Like the majority of countries, 
India has no social security. Elsewhere, socialism's demise and subsidy 
cutbacks as part of economic restructuring have left many elderly with few 
benefits to fall back on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not accustomed to people living so long. In the next five or six 
years, we'll have to make care for the aging one of the components of our 
planning," said Maher Mahran, Egypt's population and family planning minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore has already started. Fearful that its aging population will become 
dependent on a safety net designed for the poor, Singapore's Parliament debated 
a bill this year allowing elderly parents to sue their children for maintenance 
if they are abandoned financially. By 2025, 25% of Singapore's population is 
expected to be over 60. About 10% is over 60 now. 
</P>
<P>
 A second conspicuous feature of the demographic transition is an unprecedented 
imbalance in numbers, both within countries and between them. 
</P>
<P>
 India's biggest breakthrough has been in Kerala, a southwestern state of 29 
million people, denser than Bangladesh and more populous than Canada. Per 
capita income there is among India's lowest. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Kerala's fertility rate of 2.2 children per woman is almost at replacement 
level, only a fraction higher than the U.S. average of 2.1. Kerala's birthrate 
is now a third lower than that in the rest of India. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1950s, we had a problem in every part of this country. Now, the goals 
of population programs have been reached in Kerala and much of the south," 
Wadia said. "About a third of the country has completed or is passing through 
the demographic transition." 
</P>
<P>
 At the other extreme is Uttar Pradesh, India's northeastern state of 140 
million. As a separate country, it would be the world's seventh-most-populous 
nation. Its fertility rate of 5.5 is also among the world's highest. 
</P>
<P>
 The imbalance is mirrored around the world. The populations of 58 countries 
will grow by more than 100% over the next 35 years, and 20 countries will grow 
by more than 150%, according to a new World Bank survey. The six 
fastest-growing areas are Oman, the Gaza Strip, Niger, Yemen, Ethiopia and 
Angola. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all Third World countries are problem areas. In Thailand, couples using 
contraceptives rose from 10% in 1970 to 67% in 1987. The average number of 
children plummeted from 6.2 to 2.4 per woman, PAI reports. And between 1960 and 
1990, Third World women using contraceptives increased from 18% to 50%, the 
Population Reference Bureau (PRB) reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet until the year 2030, 95% of population growth will be in the Third World, 
most where income averages less than $2 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many countries, population growth will keep outstripping their ability to 
provide for people. It'll be a perpetual quest, like Alice in Wonderland -- 
going as fast as you can but still not able to get there," said Kaval Gulhati, 
Indian-born co-founder of the Center for Development and Population Activities, 
which is active in the former East Bloc and in the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the developed world has basically made the transition. Japan's 
fertility rate plunged from 5.1 children per woman in 1925 to 1.53 children per 
woman in 1991, PRB reports. Six European states have even lower rates. Italy 
averages only 1.3 children per woman. 
</P>
<P>
 And authorities in France, Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Bulgaria and 
Hungary have told the United Nations that their birthrates are too low. 
</P>
<P>
 The implications of the imbalance are vast. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs will be a major challenge, the U.N. Population Fund reports. Developing 
countries will have to create 30 million jobs yearly just to maintain current 
employment levels. Although food production has kept up with population growth 
on paper, distribution is uneven. One in eight people on Earth now does not 
have enough to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Africa, where population is expected to grow 3% per year through 2000, 
the food supply is projected to grow only 2%, contributing to a 50% increase in 
the number of poor, the International Food Policy Research Institute reports. 
And the limit of production may have been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world's fishermen and farmers can no longer keep up with the growth in 
world population. This means that providing seafood and grain for the 90 
million people being added each year is possible only by reducing consumption 
by those already here," said Lester Brown, president of Worldwatch Institute 
and author of "Full House," a new report on population and resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before this decade is over, food security may replace military security as a 
principal preoccupation of governments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers crunch will be most severe in cities. In 15 years, 368 cities in 
the developing world will have more than a million inhabitants, according to 
the United Nations. Because most don't have the resources or infrastructures to 
cope, vast numbers of people will live in slums. 
</P>
<P>
 With annual population growth of 4%, Bombay faces a shortage of 2.5 million 
houses by 2000, when 75% of its estimated 16 million people will live in huts 
or on the pavement, Indian demographers predict. Housing is already so tight in 
Bombay that the sturdier shanties in Dharavi sell for hundreds of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rapid, unprecedented pace of population growth dwarfs all trends in terms 
of its implications for the future of human, national and international 
security," said Timothy E. Wirth, U.S. undersecretary of state for global 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Human security is about the 1 billion individuals who live in abject poverty. 
It is about the 800 million who go hungry every day and the 240 million 
malnourished, the 1.3 billion without clean water and more than 2 billion 
without safe sanitation." 
</P>
<P>
 All those factors contribute to tension. Population is considered a component, 
for example, in the breakdown of order in Rwanda and Somalia. Dharavi has twice 
been the site of deadly clashes, while Uttar Pradesh has a long history of 
communal violence in which population plays a role. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether within countries or between regions, an imbalance raises the 
likelihood of conflict. When one country or group of people is doing well and 
others are not, one group wants more, and the other wants to hang on to what 
they have. This mitigates against peace," said Mitchell, the State Department's 
population official. 
</P>
<P>
 Swelling population in developing countries also makes the likelihood of 
catastrophic economic harm from natural disasters four times greater and heavy 
death tolls twice as likely, according to a 1994 U.N. survey. As numbers 
increase, people are forced to settle in disaster-prone areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Dharavi, for example, borders a marsh. During the dry season, the newer huts 
precariously abut its murky waters. During the rainy season, many are flooded, 
forcing families to move again, sometimes onto Bombay sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, imbalances can contribute to reversals. In Europe, dwindling ranks 
of young workers and soaring numbers of pensioners have led some governments to 
adopt policies -- boosting maternity and child care benefits -- to slow 
population declines. 
</P>
<P>
 Imbalances are also reflected regionally, according to a new World Bank 
report. Between 1995 and 2030, Africa's population will increase 116%, while 
North America's will grow only 24%. Asia's will increase 47%, while Europe's 
will grow by only 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 As the issues change, so do the solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1951, India has tried a host of approaches, including coercive promotion 
of sterilization during the mid-1970s. The backlash brought down a government, 
but sterilization and abortion are still provided free. Family planning is now 
promoted in street plays and puppet shows, TV ads, billboard campaigns and 
outreach programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, India's Parliament even considered a bill banning national and 
state legislators who had more than two children. The law would have affected 
the prime minister and family welfare minister, both of whom have eight 
children, as well as 397 of 508 members of Parliament, according to Family 
Planning World. The measure didn't pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The new model -- for India as well as the developing world -- is Kerala. Its 
emphases on women's rights, education, land reform, food security and health 
services have led to some of the highest standards of living in the Third World 
-- and halved the birthrate in two generations. 
</P>
<P>
 The status of women is a critical component. "Measures such as later age of 
marriage, education, occupations and the ability to exercise legal, political 
and economic rights are a powerful stimulus to use family planning," Wadia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been amply demonstrated in Kerala, Sri Lanka, throughout East Asia 
in Thailand and Indonesia, where women who have higher status and some 
education and access to suitable health services also choose to have smaller 
families," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kerala, literacy is almost twice as high as in any other Indian state. The 
average life expectancy is over 70 years -- 25% higher than in the rest of 
India. And 80% of couples now use family planning -- compared with only 28% in 
Uttar Pradesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Dharavi is also making inroads. Literacy among women has increased to 76% 
there, compared to the national average of 39%. And now 63% of the girls in the 
slums wait until until they are 18 or older to marry, and 76% do not have their 
first child until that age. The average number of children in Bombay's slums 
has declined to 2.2 per woman, says India's Family Planning Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forty years ago, there was a magic-bullet approach that said dispensing 
family planning services was sufficient to reduce population growth to ideal 
levels," Mitchell said. "But now we recognize that family planning is only one 
part of a bigger picture." 
</P>
<P>
 But just how much work lies ahead is again reflected in India. Demographers 
now predict that even if India achieves replacement level as soon as 2015, its 
growth will not level out before reaching 1.9 billion people -- about a third 
of the Earth's current numbers.

<P>
 Amid blaring reggae music, bright product displays and 100 kinds of scented, 
textured, colored and playfully packaged condoms, the young Japanese couple 
made their choice: orange and chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 But not before they lingered over the lollipop condoms, examined the ones with 
the monkey motif and laughed at the glow-in-the-darks. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan is a world leader in condom use, and stores like Condomania are one 
reason why. Opened two years ago in Tokyo's trendy Harajuku district, the store 
has liberated the condom from adult store sleaze and the antiseptic feel of 
pharmacies. As a result, what used to be regarded as shameful rubber sheaths 
have become fun, even chic, for many young Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like the atmosphere here," explained the girl, 15, clutching her condoms 
packaged in miniature orange juice and chocolate milk cartons. "If you look at 
the ordinary shops that sell condoms, there are a lot of strange people there." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Condomania's cheerful ambience, the high school sophomores say they 
have no druthers about using prophylactics. And those more bashful can 
furtively buy them from vending machines or order them via computer network, 
two new services introduced here last year. 
</P>
<P>
 As condoms come under the global spotlight this summer -- promoted at the 
international AIDS conference in Yokohama two weeks ago, and scheduled for 
discussion at the world population meeting in Cairo early next month -- one 
thing is clear: When it comes to condoms, Japan's market is in a class of its 
own, and a primary factor in birth control here. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Japanese consumers bought 547 million condoms, the world's biggest 
market after the United States, where 561 million were purchased. Per capita, 
Japanese buy twice as many condoms as Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 And 77% of Japanese couples using contraceptives choose condoms, the world's 
highest market share, according to a 1994 survey by the Mainichi newspaper's 
Population Problems Research Institute. The figure in the United States is 
about one-fourth that level, various international comparisons show. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Japanese appear particularly conscientious. The Condomania couple said 
they forgo sex if they don't have condoms, and the Mainichi survey showed more 
than half of unmarried couples in their teens and 20s used birth control, 
compared to just 20% of unmarried people in their late 30s. 
</P>
<P>
 Makoto Atoh of the Ministry of Health and Welfare said Japanese society has 
not traditionally frowned on premarital sex; it was reportedly prevalent among 
farming and fishing families during the Edo period from 1600 to 1868. But the 
Meiji Restoration ushered in a more strict social atmosphere, importing 
Victorian morals, Atoh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although premarital sex is becoming more common, it appears to be less 
prevalent than in America and Western Europe. A 1990 United Nations survey 
indicated, for instance, that 32%of unmarried 19-year-old women in Japan had 
experienced sex, compared to 65% of their U.S. counterparts. Unmarried couples 
living together is still discouraged. As a result of such attitudes -- and easy 
access to abortion -- Japan's rate of out-of-wedlock births is just 1%, far 
lower than Canada's 23% or Sweden's 48%, U.N. figures indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite growing use of condoms by Japanese youth, sales are leveling off. 
Condom production in Japan has stayed flat for the past decade, with 649 
million produced for the domestic market last year, compared to 653 million in 
1984. To stay profitable, Japan's condom makers have expanded their exports. 
</P>
<P>
 And population trends don't bode well for the future. Japan is aging quickly. 
The number of 20-year-olds is projected to drop by half in the next seven 
years, said Teruyoshi Okubo of Okamoto Industries Inc., Japan's leading condom 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
 What's worse, Okamoto officials have cooked up several statistical analyses 
and surmised that Japan's already dwindling number of young men are having sex 
less frequently than before. According to one scientific study cited by Okubo, 
Japanese men are producing just one-fourth to one-half the amount of sperm they 
did 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "When your sperm count decreases, so does your desire to ejaculate, so the 
total number of sexual encounters is decreasing," Okubo postulated. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributed the declining sperm count to stress, overwork and the increasing 
ingestion of food additives and other chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When those of us in our 40s were in our 20s, we were stronger than today's 
20-year-olds," he bragged. "Of course, another reason for more sex back then 
was that there wasn't much other entertainment."  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some scholars surmise that the Japanese male's increasingly listless 
sex drive may be one reason for the steady decline in the average number of 
children borne per woman -- now at 1.43, Japan's lowest in history. Usually, 
women's increasing entry into universities and the labor market are cited as 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential crimp on future market growth for condoms is the possible 
introduction of the low-dosage birth control pill. The major reason condom use 
is so high in Japan is that few alternatives exist. The low-dose birth-control 
pill is still not available in Japan, despite 20 years of efforts to legalize 
it, said Yuriko Ashino of the Japan Family Planning Federation.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ministry of Health and Welfare was expected to approve the pill this year 
but sent the proposal back for more study. They said at the time that 
widespread use of the pill would discourage condom use and promote the spread 
of AIDS. The decision outraged such activists as Ashino, who saw it as a move 
to protect the profits of abortionists, deny women reproductive freedom and 
arrest the country's declining birthrate.  
</P>
<P>
 "But compared to the high fertility of developing countries, low fertility is 
not such a problem," Ashino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with new contraceptive competitors, however, some producers still see 
profits in Japan's condom market. The London International Group, a specialist 
in thin-film technology and the world's market leader in condoms, plans to 
introduce its first prophylactic in Japan next year in partnership with 
Okamoto. The product will be the world's first polyurethane condom, both 
thinner and stronger than the current latex condoms in use, said Clive 
Kitchener, director of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 The new product will be introduced this autumn in the United States, where the 
London group already markets its condoms under the brand names Ramses and Chic. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the biggest change in technology in 60 years," Kitchener said. 
</P>
<P>
 The London group will be the first foreign firm to break into the Japanese 
market. So far, Japan has not imported one single condom, even though the 
world's four other top markets -- the United States, Germany, Britain and Spain 
-- have allowed imported brands. 
</P>
<P>
 Okamoto is also putting out new products. A year or two ago, it responded to 
complaints that the condoms were too tight and introduced in the Japanese 
market the same diameter it sells in America with the catch phrase: "Your boy 
these days is big." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, Okamoto executive Okubo is not optimistic. Given the glum 
future, the firm plans to focus on its other lines of business: rubber for 
Michelin tires and Reebok sports shoes.

 President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina will come to Santiago on Thursday for 
a two-day session with Chilean President Eduardo Frei.The meeting is a 
manifestation of increasingly close ties between the neighboring South American 
countries, which were on the verge of war in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Chile and Argentina are planning improved highways to cross their Andean 
frontier and a pipeline to bring Argentine gas to Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 A major subject of discussion is expected to be negotiations for a trade 
agreement between Chile and Mercosur, the duty-free zone being formed by 
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

THE WEEK AHEAD: VILNIUS; HATCHING NEST EGGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Lithuania -- where inflation was upward of 1,100% in 1992 and 188% in 1993 
-- voters will cast ballots Saturday in a national referendum on requiring the 
government to multiply citizens' savings 100-fold. 
</P>
<P>
 The referendum has Western economists gasping in horror. The International 
Monetary Fund has condemned it as likely to kick off a new stage of wild 
inflation,  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas has asked voters just where 
the government -- already running a small deficit -- is supposed to find enough 
money to give everyone a larger nest egg. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions have watched helplessly as their life savings fizzled to nothing in 
Lithuania, Russia, Ukraine and other inflation-prone republics emerging from 
the wreckage of the Soviet Union.

NATIONAL AGENDA; CAUTION: SOME MEXICO TOLLWAYS PAVED IN GOLD; THE TOLLS OUTPACE 
PEOPLE'S POCKETBOOKS AS GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO RECOUP BILLIONS USED TO FINANCE NEW 
ROADS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At rush hour on Friday evening, the highway vista stretching eastward is one 
to delight and amaze any Southern Californian: four lanes of empty asphalt, as 
far as the eye can see; no graffiti on the overpasses or road signs, and only a 
single billboard, extolling the virtues of Mexico's ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the new, privately financed Merida-to-Cancun highway spanning 
the Yucatan Peninsula -- charging cars $35 and trucks more than $100 for the 
160-mile stretch -- seems an unlikely proposition: running one of the world's 
most expensive toll roads through some of the most underdeveloped jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 But if this and other tollways built in Mexico over the past six years 
succeed, they may serve as models to cash-strapped, Third World governments 
looking for ways to finance infrastructure as they move toward a market 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of similar projects are under way in China, Indonesia, Brazil and even 
Russia, although none are as far along as those in Mexico. The major drawback 
to these roadways, Mexican residents say, is that commercial considerations 
(often international tourism) and private investors (including foreigners) can 
determine such crucial factors as the route, the tolls and the location of 
exits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Merida-Cancun highway, for example, links the region's commercial and 
political capital near the Gulf of Mexico to its money-generating tourism 
behemoth on the Caribbean. Not surprisingly -- at the prices it charges -- 
traffic is now largely confined to truckloads of high-priced goods, armored 
cars carrying cash, tourist buses and wealthy travelers' cars. Ordinary 
Mexicans use the old roads. 
</P>
<P>
 As the tollway slashes across northern Yucatan's jungle scrub and forest, it 
cuts through the ranchos of two dozen Maya farmers, some of whom have planted 
rows of maize right up to the metal wire fences that protect the road's 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of his six-year term in 1988, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
announced ambitious plans to complete 2,500 miles of privately funded tollways 
by 1994, bringing the total to 3,100 miles. But that goal and timetable pushed 
the cost of construction to an estimated $8 billion to $10 billion, a heavy 
load for investors, some of them foreigners. The price tag for the Mexico 
City-Acapulco tollway alone is estimated at $900 million; the Mexico 
City-Guadalajara estimate is $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The puzzle was how to recoup that kind of investment, much less service the 
debt. The only answer was to charge tolls that were out of reach for most 
Mexicans: Toluca to Mexico City, 14 miles, $6.30; Mexico City to Acapulco, 202 
miles, $80; Acapulco to Cuernavaca, 165 miles, $60. When Long Beach resident 
Bill Hepler recently balked at the $7.50 Tijuana-Tecate toll for 22 miles, he 
said the toll booth operator accused him of being cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 While business is good in the Tijuana area and on the Mexico City-Acapulco 
highway, tolls have kept traffic way down on the newer Mexican tollways in 
less-traveled areas such as Yucatan, government officials say. On a drive along 
the entire Merida-Cancun stretch over a two-day period, fewer than 50 vehicles 
were observed in both directions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something is going to have to give," said Abel Beltran-del Rio, president of 
Ciemex-Wefa, a Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.-based group specializing in Mexican economic 
development. "Either they reduce the fees in one way or another, or some of 
these highways will have no demand." 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway authorities have to refinance the debt in the next few years, 
Beltran-del Rio said, stretching out the repayment schedule to investors from 
20 to 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some residents living along the new routes are unhappy about the 
cost. In Baja California last year, protesters several times blocked a section 
of Mexico's Highway 2 near the town of La Rumorosa. The government plans to 
incorporate the public highway, which links Tijuana and Mexicali, into sections 
of a new, privately funded toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the protests, the federal secretary for communication and 
transportation announced a toll reduction for the section. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the west coast of Mexico, a trip through the high deserts of Sonora into 
the cornfields of Sinaloa state is punctuated by yet more toll stations, 
forewarned in the barren landscape by the telltale sign: "Prepare Su Cuota," 
get your money ready for gates at upcoming towns: 
</P>
<P>
 Magdalena, Estacion Don, Hermosillo, Fundicion, Esperanza, each for the price 
of a U.S. movie and equally unpredictable in value. Six dollars can buy two 
hours of driving on one stretch of the interstate, less than 40 minutes on 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are choices. "Via Libre" or "Via Cuota," free route or toll route, 
becomes the constant gamble, both in road conditions and in fact. There is the 
incentive of a lottery ticket at every tollbooth: "Take the Good Road and Win!" 
the ticket urges, offering as a prize a four-door 1994 Volkswagen Golf, fully 
loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately funded Merida-Cancun tollway has so far generated less publicity 
and protest than others in Mexico. One reason for the lack of protests in 
Yucatan is that a serviceable parallel route, Highway 180, already exists 
between Merida and Cancun. There are, nonetheless, complaints, even among those 
affluent enough to use the route. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't like the high prices," said Carlos R. Menendez Navarrete, 
publisher of El Diario de Yucatan, the peninsula's largest newspaper. "And 
there have been some complaints about the construction. They say the road is 
too narrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco P. Maya, who sells hammocks in Merida, likes the tollway but cannot 
use it to commute to his home in Yokdzonot, southeast of Chichen Itza. "There 
aren't any exits near enough to my home," Maya said. "That's the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Between Merida and Cancun, a distance of 160 miles, there are only two exits, 
for the colonial city of Valladolid and the Maya ruins at Chichen Itza. 
</P>
<P>
 For those living in the tollway's path, life has changed considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 Maya farmers were displaced by the highway in Yucatan and Quintana 
Roo states, according to Yucatan state officials. Some of those displaced and 
others living nearby are upset that the fenced highway means they are now 
unable to move their animals across the right-of-way for grazing. 
</P>
<P>
 And questions have been raised about the manner in which the route was 
acquired and the owners compensated, especially the ejidos, communal tracts 
distributed after the Mexican revolution. On the plus side, the construction 
provided relatively well-paying jobs for local subsistence farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the route between Merida and Cancun is mostly flat and relatively 
straight, construction cost considerably less than other Mexican tollways, an 
estimated $225 million -- only double initial estimates. Like the others, the 
Merida-Cancun route reduces the driving time nearly by half, in this case by 
cutting through the jungle. One modern service plaza has been completed and a 
second is nearly done. Except for a more exotic variety of road kill and the 
absence of emergency call boxes, it could be any superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 The new tollway is no guarantee traffic tragedies can be avoided. On the day 
President Salinas came to Yucatan to open the completed tollway on Oct. 21, 
1993, two members of the inaugural committee were killed in a taxi accident on 
the roadway. Last month, five priests were killed when a tire exploded and 
their van overturned near Valladolid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tollway is very well built, but the speed limit is too high," said the 
Rev. John Lomasney, a Maryknoll priest who has spent 50 of his 77 years in 
Yucatan. "Our people don't have the experience to drive at those high speeds." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, on a recent trip, traffic moved at autobahn speeds. The only vehicle 
driving within the posted 70 miles per hour limit belonged to the tollway 
authority. Roadside signs urge drivers to fasten their seat belts, which, alas, 
many vehicles in Yucatan still do not have.

MARKET FOCUS; RUSSIAN TAX POLICE TALLY UP VICTORIES -- $3 BILLION WORTH; 
DESPITE THE PROGRESS, CHEATING IS A WAY OF LIFE. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND 
BUSINESSES SHORT THE GOVERNMENT. SOME HAVEN'T PAID A SINGLE RUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mikhail, a young Russian making his fortune in the import-export business, has 
a lot of worries. The racketeers want more money, so does his driver, and for 
some reason the last batch of sneakers he imported from Hong Kong aren't 
selling. 
</P>
<P>
 But paying his taxes isn't a concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "My business hasn't paid a single ruble in taxes," he boldly admitted. "No one 
I know pays unless they're forced. I won't give them anything until they come 
and get me." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Russians say they duck the duties because the burden is outrageously high 
thanks to the more than 40 different kinds of taxes that Russia heaps on 
citizens and their businesses. Moreover, people just don't think they'll get 
caught. 
</P>
<P>
 But that may be changing. To fight tax dodgers, the Russian government has 
created a separate, souped-up police force. Like the "Untouchables" who fought 
Chicago's gangland crime wave in the 1920s and 1930s, the Tax Police aim to 
restore law and order, not to mention fiscal responsibility, to post-Communist 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason to be afraid of us if you pay your taxes honestly," said 
Sergei Almazov, head of the Tax Police. But people who shirk their 
responsibility, he warned, will be caught and punished. 
</P>
<P>
 Russians' reticence to perform the central civic duty of paying their taxes 
illustrates how hard it is, after 70 years of communism, to transform this vast 
nation into a well-functioning democracy.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have to teach people that the money that they are paying isn't gone from 
them forever," Almazov, a former KGB officer, said in an interview. "It's going 
to the state budget, which returns to the people in the form of government 
programs. To educate taxpayers so they understand this system is our most 
important role." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Russia needs every ruble of revenue it is due. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the government has no mandatory withholding, no national identity 
numbers -- that is, no easy way to monitor how much people earn in this 
cash-based economy -- tax evasion is massive. Millions of people and 
enterprises fail to pay all that is due, Almazov said. The Tax Inspectorate 
estimates that it failed to collect $9 billion due in 1993 -- about a quarter 
of its anticipated revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian government founded the Tax Police in 1992 to aid the Tax Service 
-- the agency responsible for levying and collecting taxes -- by investigating 
possible tax cheats. Moreover, officials hoped that a strong enforcement arm 
would intimidate Russians into paying. 
</P>
<P>
 For the muscle to get the job done, the Tax Police was endowed with enormous 
powers: It can seize assets, throw suspected tax evaders in jail and levy huge 
penalties. It entices hard work from its 11,000 agents -- many of whom came 
from the former KGB, the Defense Ministry and other security organs -- by 
rewarding them with a percentage of the amount they recover, with no upper 
limit.  
</P>
<P>
 This incentive system is supposed to discourage tax collectors from taking 
bribes. Still, in this land of rampant corruption, the potential for official 
malfeasance is immense. Politicians, for instance, can suggest to the tax force 
that their enemies be investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some entrepreneurs say that they pay off the Russian 
"Untouchables." 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation (with corruption) exists -- we don't try to hide it," Almazov 
admitted, but he said only four Tax Police employees were convicted of 
corruption in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Also open to abuse is the Tax Police's right to reward informants who turn in 
tax evaders with up to 10% of the take that results from their tips. Sometimes 
the motivation of the tipster is suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 "A very small number" of tipsters have come forward, said Almazov, but most 
leads are pursued. "If someone comes to us with information, we have to figure 
out if the person is interested (personally in the case)," he said. "It could 
be a competitor." 
</P>
<P>
 "But if it checks out, we have the right to reward this collaborator," Almazov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these problems, the Tax Police has been a financial success. Since it 
was established, the unit has recovered 3.5 trillion rubles, about $3 billion, 
through investigations and audits -- fully 8% of total government revenue for 
the period. About one business in five has been audited, Almazov said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Russians' tax-evading attitude is hard to change. To help put fear 
into their compatriots' hearts, the tax cops have focused their energy on a few 
high-profile, multimillion-dollar cases. Among their targets: the five-star 
Grand Hotel Europa in St. Petersburg and the former state insurance company, 
Ingostrakh. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that has brought them a flood of publicity, the Tax Police also 
spearheaded the government's crackdown on the MMM investment fund, whose 
pyramid scheme collapsed in July in a spectacular securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax authorities began investigating MMM in 1992, but it wasn't until this 
year that the Tax Police -- with the government's blessing -- started publicly 
warning that MMM was financially unstable and violating tax laws. The tax cops' 
pronouncements became so strong that, eventually, they spurred a run on the 
fund. Share prices crashed from more than $55 to just 50 cents in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tax Police tried to cement its image as the protector of Russia's new 
investor class by arresting MMM President Sergei Mavrodi, rappelling down ropes 
from the roof of Mavrodi's house in a spectacular show of force. Mavrodi has 
since been charged with tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the MMM assault backfired. Instead of thanking the unit, many of 
the estimated 5 million angry MMM shareholders blame the tax authorities for 
wiping out their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Russia -- our mentality is different," said an exasperated Nikolai 
Medvedev, tax-force spokesman. "We had decades where the government gave and 
the government took away. . . . People just haven't adjusted to the new 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tax Police are likely to be involved in the MMM affair for months to come. 
Officials are starting to sort through Mavrodi's complex web of 44 shell 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Almazov hopes that in the long run, the Tax Police's image will be enhanced by 
its dealings with MMM. "Our people are trying to do something good," he 
insisted.

CULTURE; CHINESE ROCKERS ON A ROLL; NO LONGER A BACK-ROOM PHENOMENON, THE YOUTH 
MUSIC HAS GONE COMMERCIAL -- UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF THE AUTHORITIES.

 "The world we live in, is just like a garbage dump  
</P>
<P>
 People here are like worms, fighting and grabbing  
</P>
<P>
 All they eat is conscience, all they waste is thought."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Chinese rocker He Yong from his new album 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What was occurring at the Children's Drama Theater on a recent afternoon 
looked suspiciously like a rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with various English formulations using the "F" 
word, Chinese "New Rock" performer He Yong was on stage executing twisting 
vertical leaps and violently slapping his guitar strings as he sang "There is 
no hope! There is no hope! There is no hope! There is no hope!" -- the 
deafening refrain from his new song, "Garbage Dump." 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, however, what was taking place on the small stage in central 
Beijing, was a "press conference" sponsored by a Taiwanese record company, 
China Fire Productions, that has contracts with He Yong and two other young 
rockers who performed that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance/press conference was approved by Beijing municipal officials 
only after Taiwanese rock promoter Landy Chang, who has a total of seven 
mainland Chinese rock musicians under contract, pledged that there would be no 
politically subversive lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Chang's best-known groups, the heavy-metal Tang Dynasty, sold 2 million 
albums last year, including significant sales in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan. 
Their success won them another first for mainland China -- sponsorship by a 
major instrument company, Tokyo-based Gibson Asia Inc. In the last two years, 
China has been swarmed by Taiwanese, Hong Kong and Japanese talent agents eager 
to get young artists under contract.  
</P>
<P>
 No longer a back-room phenomenon, Chinese rock 'n' roll has entered what 
performers and promoters say is a new phase of commercialization, with artists 
scrambling for foreign contracts while trying to compete against Hong Kong 
bubble-gum music and karaoke bars for the public's attention.  
</P>
<P>
 The carefully staged event in the Children's Drama Theater represents a recent 
push by the Beijing government to cash in on the rock music market while, at 
the same time, also trying to keep it under political control. 
</P>
<P>
 "My artists don't push political themes," Chang, 32, said during an interview 
in a hotel coffee shop. "They love their country. They want to create, not 
destroy." 
</P>
<P>
 Such talk is sweet music to the Chinese Communist leadership, long suspicious 
of rock music as a moral and political pollutant. Just to make sure things 
didn't get out of hand, several officials sat in the back row of the theater 
watching nervously during the midafternoon performance. Even holding the 
concert at 3 p.m., not exactly prime time for the nocturnal rock crowd, was 
another way of controlling the event.  
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, when the officials joined promoters for drinks and food, Chang said 
they confided their satisfaction that the performers had restricted themselves 
to themes of alienation, disgust, anomie, frustration, nausea, hopelessness and 
despair instead of diving into corruption and politics under the Communist 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Normal teen-age depression, it seems, is OK. What the government definitely 
does not want is the emergence of another Cui Jian, the charismatic rock star 
whose song "Rock 'n' Roll on the New Long March" became the anthem of the 
student generation that led the 1989 demonstrations in Tian An Men Square.  
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, the government has only permitted Cui Jian to perform on special 
occasions, such as charity concerts. Several of his scheduled performances have 
been canceled without notice. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, when the new Singapore-managed Hard Rock Cafe opened in Beijing, Cui 
Jian was denied entrance to the inaugural concert featuring American blues 
master B. B. King. After waiting for an hour outside the club, which features a 
mock Sistine Chapel ceiling with Elvis as God, Cui stomped off in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a real Hard Rock Cafe," the rejected rocker pronounced to 
reporters, "I think they are kissing the government's butt." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard Rock Cafe manager Nicholas Ong denied excluding Cui for political 
reasons. "He was simply not invited and did not have an invitation card," said 
Ong, who avoids government interference by booking only foreign groups in his 
400-seat club, where he says 80% of his clientele are foreign residents and 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 But that does not mean that Ong is always able to steer completely clear of 
controversy. Old Maoist suspicions of foreign devils twanging electric guitars 
still persist. 
</P>
<P>
 In late July, the Beijing Hard Rock Cafe was attacked in an editorial by the 
official China Youth News for the "barbaric" practice of stamping an inked 
symbol on customers' hands when they enter the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "The marks stamped on the body are a form of barbarism and humiliation," the 
editorial railed. It described the club bouncers as "border security police" 
and described the club as "a hard rock under the wheels of civilization." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mind of Wang Yong, a talented musician who played the traditional 
Chinese stringed instrument known as guzheng in Cui Jian's band, rock 'n' roll 
in China is already in a period of creative decline after it first emerged in 
Beijing in the early 1980s. For the past year, Wang has concentrated on 
creating computer-generated music. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market for rock 'n' roll is in depression since last year," Wang said in 
an interview. "This is not only the government's fault. Most of the young 
people today like superstars from Hong Kong and Taiwan, or Western 'easy 
listening' or disco music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our bands are always pretending they're frustrated, shouting as loud as they 
can, like He Yong. But maybe there are not so many frustrated young people 
now."  
</P>
<P>
 For his part, rocker He Yong, sipping hot tea in a trendy new underground 
coffeehouse after his afternoon performance, was simply happy to be back on 
stage under any conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first half of this year," he said, "they didn't let us perform at 
all. We were always being harassed and closed down. Sometimes they let us do 
shows in Inner Mongolia and other places far away, but not in Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden government permission for the afternoon "press conference" 
performance, the 25-year-old rocker said coolly, was not an artistic, cultural 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, rock 'n' roll is a business. The government supports business."

 Samarkand. The name evokes mystery and romance. Eastern writers long ago 
described this oasis city, set in the midst of the deserts and mountains of 
Central Asia, as the Mirror of the World, the Garden of the Blessed, the Fourth 
Paradise.  
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, few outsiders visited Samarkand, isolated as it was in the 
depths of the Soviet Union's Central Asian empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, parties of foreign tourists stroll around the "Mirror of the World" 
admiring the turquoise domes and blue-tiled mosques and minarets, and gaze on a 
sight once reserved for a few rare and intrepid wanderers -- the distant 
prospect of the great turquoise dome and crumbling archway of the Bibi Khanum 
mosque and the glittering minarets of the Registan. 
</P>
<P>
 As Central Asia emerges from its long isolation, however, that scene may 
change. It is becoming clear that hundreds of ancient buildings in Samarkand 
and the other historic caravan cities of Bukhara and Khiva are under threat 
both from natural deterioration and from heavy-handed Soviet-era restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization issued a status 
report on the region that presages a UNESCO program to help Uzbekistan look 
after its three historic cities, with their wealth of ancient architecture. The 
report is highly critical of some of the restoration work already under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Samarkand is no stranger to restoration. When Russia captured the city in 
1868, the great mosques and madrassas were already crumbling, assisted by 
tremors that often shake the area. Their decline continued until the Soviet 
government began restoring or rebuilding some ancient buildings, particularly 
during the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet restoration re-created the beauty of some of this architecture, but 
closer inspection shows its limitations. Much of the decorative tile work has 
been replaced at various times.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell the difference between original tile work and the newer tiles 
because the color of the old tiles is better," a local guide said, pointing out 
the darker, richer hues of some of the old tiles, which have not faded like 
Soviet-period replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most of the buildings are showing their considerable age, and it is 
often difficult to tell which crumbling details are centuries-old and which are 
crumbling Soviet restorations only three decades old. 
</P>
<P>
 Samarkand became a byword for Oriental splendor in the 14th Century when the 
conqueror Tamerlane -- or "Timur the Lame" -- made it the capital of an empire 
stretching from Turkey to the edge of China. He sent architects and craftsmen 
here from all over Asia to ensure that the city lived up to his great name. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians conquered Samarkand as their empire expanded rapidly through 
Central Asia in the 19th Century. After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, it 
was all but closed to outside visitors during much of the seven decades of the 
Soviet Union.  
</P>
<P>
 With the Soviet Union now history itself, Samarkand is a prize of the 
independent republic of Uzbekistan, whose government is eager to promote the 
ancient caravan city as a tourist attraction, pulling in dollars to fill the 
hard-currency reserves of a shattered post-Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's fame also has another use for a government eager to create a sense 
of citizenship in a country that did not even exist until Josef Stalin drew its 
borders on the map in the 1920s. Tamerlane and Samarkand are potent symbols 
well-suited for boosting the Uzbek nationalism that has become the official 
ideology replacing yesterday's communism.  
</P>
<P>
 Tamerlane's name has been revived from Soviet obscurity to provide a new 
heroic father figure in place of Lenin, and the architects and craftsmen are at 
work again in the conqueror's former capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The jewel of Samarkand is the Registan, once the city's central market square. 
The square is flanked on three sides by three imposing madrassas, or Islamic 
colleges, whose minarets, domes and high-arched facades are covered in 
elaborate decorative tile work of cobalt blue and turquoise.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the three, a 15th-Century madrassa built by Tamerlane's grandson, the 
astronomer-king Ulugh Beg, is now a hive of building activity. The 600th 
anniversary of Ulugh Beg's birth is to be celebrated this autumn, one of 
several such new national celebrations, and his madrassa, once a worn and 
crumbling ruin, is being virtually rebuilt for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the long main bazaar from the Registan stands the Bibi 
Khanum mosque. Named after Tamerlane's Chinese wife, the Bibi Khanum was 
probably built to commemorate the conqueror's capture of Delhi. Its great 
turquoise dome and massive entrance portal once made it one of the world's 
largest mosques. 
</P>
<P>
 Long an imposing ruin, the dome of the Bibi Khanum mosque has been repaired 
and major rebuilding has been under way for years -- but only recently has the 
work speeded up. 
</P>
<P>
 The forthcoming UNESCO report, however, points out some dangers facing 
Uzbekistan's historic architecture. One of the most serious problems is that 
most of the ancient buildings of Samarkand and Bukhara are suffering from 
rising damp. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground water in the cities has risen significantly in recent years, 
probably because of the increase of piped water, combined with poor drainage. 
Rising as high as nine feet in the ancient brick walls, the damp forms 
corrosive acids and salts which gradually destroy the masonry, mortar and 
intricate decorations. 
</P>
<P>
 A combined mosque and madrassa on the Registan, the 17th-Century Tilla-Kari, 
is under particular threat. The name Tilla-Kari, which means "Covered in Gold," 
probably derives from the beautiful gilding on the inside walls of the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tilla-Kari's problem with dampness has been compounded by a Soviet 
rebuilding of the mosque's dome in the 1970s. It was rebuilt with heavy 
concrete rather than the lighter original brick. This, says the UNESCO report, 
has caused a slow, uneven sinking of the foundations, cracking the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 While the UNESCO report acknowledges the value of much of the restoration now 
being carried out by the Uzbek government, it expresses concern for the 
historical accuracy of some of the rebuilding and decoration work, which it 
says is being done without sufficient knowledge of the original craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the rebuilding, using old Soviet methods, is actually harmful, the 
report says, citing such practices as the use of concrete and iron reinforcing 
rods to replace decayed brickwork. These modern materials are potentially 
corrosive and can damage the original bricks and tiles. The report particularly 
criticizes the rebuilding of a second story on the Ulugh Beg madrassa. The 
original was removed a few centuries ago. The new work could damage the fragile 
ground floor irreparably, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineer in charge disagrees. The structure is strong enough, says 
Egamberdi Nurulayev of Uzbekistan's Institute of Conservation and Restoration 
of Cultural Monuments. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the UNESCO team "follows the view that you should leave monuments 
(ancient buildings) as they are now, but our monuments are made of clay and 
brick and need constant repairs. If you want them as they are, you should build 
a glass dome over them." 
</P>
<P>
 "We want these places not only for tourists, but also to be used," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamerlane himself has come in for some refashioning lately. The humble nomad 
who built an empire stretching halfway across Asia was seen in Soviet days as a 
ruthless conqueror who, by one estimate at least, caused the deaths of about 7 
million people. The architects and craftsmen sent to beautify Samarkand were 
all captive labor, unable to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, he has been recycled for use as a national hero. His historical 
epithet, "Timur the Lame," has been banished and the Karl Marx and Engels 
streets in Uzbek cities have given way to Amir ("Lord") Timur streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hero or barbarian, Timur today lies in Samarkand, buried under a delicate 
fluted turquoise dome. 
</P>
<P>
 While methods of preserving the ancient buildings of Uzbekistan still prove 
elusive, for now the architectural legacies still make a fine sight, recalling 
the words of James Elroy Flecker, which more than any others preserved the myth 
of Samarkand for Europeans: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweet to ride forth at evening from the wells  
</P>
<P>
 When shadows pass gigantic on the sand,  
</P>
<P>
 And softly through the silence beat the bells  
</P>
<P>
 Along the golden road to Samarkand."

U.S. ACCUSES 3 IN O.C. OF LOAN FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A federal grand jury has indicted six people -- including three in Orange 
County -- on charges of making false statements on income tax forms to obtain 
almost $1 million in Small Business Administration loans that ultimately went 
into default. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictments, announced Monday, represent the first legal action stemming 
from a three-year investigation aimed at the SBA's problems with borrowers 
filing inflated income statements in support of their loan applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope these indictments will prevent others from using (false tax returns) 
as a tactic to get SBA loans," said Steve Marica, assistant inspector general 
for the SBA in Washington. Marica said the action against the six people "is 
the largest group of indictments against borrowers for tax returns we've ever 
had." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation, which began in Southern California and has since expanded 
to other states, is ongoing and expected to result in more indictments soon, as 
well as bring a nationwide change in the way SBA loan documents are verified. 
</P>
<P>
 Marica said the agency is considering cross-checking all applicant tax 
statements nationwide with those filed with the Internal Revenue Service. 
Currently, all SBA applications in Southern California are cross-checked with 
the IRS, because of the preponderance of fraudulent filings in this region, SBA 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fraudulent SBA loan applications have been linked to so-called loan 
packagers, or independent consultants who help put together applications for 
SBA-backed loans at banks for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraud related to loan packagers has increased in recent years as the volume of 
SBA loans has surged -- to $6.4 billion last year, more than double the volume 
five years earlier -- while conventional business loans have all but dried up. 
As a result, the SBA has seen a rash of loan defaults, particularly in Southern 
California, that is likely to cost the federal agency and participating banks 
tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The six people indicted, including two couples, are Giam Buu Truong of 
Fountain Valley; Long Chan Quach, formerly of Cerritos and now of Pinellas 
Park, Fla.; Meng Hong Phou and Lim Chou of Colton, Calif., and Harris Hoang and 
Linh Diep of Irvine. All except Quach were arrested and arraigned on Monday, 
and have been released on bond. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the six could be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, the defendants could face maximum sentences including fines of 
$6 million to $8 million and prison terms ranging from 180 years to 300 years. 
Realistically, the sentences will be significantly less, but officials say they 
are expecting some jail time and restitution from the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictments, the six defendants submitted SBA loan 
applications in 1989 and 1990. They had disparate businesses in different 
locations, but they all used the same loan packager in Westminster, whom SBA 
officials would not identify because he is still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The six people indicted "knowingly and willingly went ahead" with what the 
loan packager was doing, said Deborah Jones, a special agent at the SBA 
inspector general's office in Los Angeles, which conducted the investigation 
with the help of the FBI. Jones said the Westminster loan consultant is being 
investigated in relation to many more SBA loans that went sour. 
</P>
<P>
 A loan packager, for a fee typically ranging from $500 to $1,500, puts 
together financial statements, tax returns and other reports that go into an 
SBA application. The SBA guarantees 70% to 90% of small-business loans that are 
funded by banks and other commercial lenders. The agency can generally 
guarantee a loan of up to $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Hochman, the assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles who brought the 
charges, said that some of the six defendants used the SBA loans to repay 
personal debts, make loans to friends and relatives and pay off mortgages on 
their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides allegedly providing personal and corporate income tax returns that 
were different from those submitted to the IRS, some of those indicted provided 
invoices and other records that authorities believe were false. 
</P>
<P>
 Truong, 46, had a business called Graphic Inn Printing in Garden Grove. 
According to officials, Truong submitted an SBA application to the Bank of 
Anaheim for a $400,000 loan in August, 1989. He eventually received a loan for 
$325,000, the amount he apparently qualified for. 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials allege that as part of his SBA application, Truong provided 
a false invoice that said his company had purchased $178,000 worth of computer 
equipment. In reality, officials said that Truong made out a check in that 
amount to a business owned by the wife of his loan packager. The loan packager 
then took 3% for himself out of that amount and returned the remainder to 
Truong. 
</P>
<P>
 A loan officer at the Bank of Anaheim, who asked not to be identified, 
recalled Truong's case. "Oh, yes, we've had our fair share" of fraudulent loan 
applications, the bank official said. "That's been a major contributor of our 
losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Stultz, owner of Stultz Financial in Newport Beach, who has been an SBA 
loan packager for more than 20 years, expressed worries that troubles with some 
loan packagers would discredit the work done by him and other legitimate loan 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's upsetting," said Stultz, who receives almost all of his loan work on 
referrals from banks. "It makes life just a lot more complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Stultz said that verification of tax forms by the SBA has added time to an 
often lengthy SBA loan application process. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Government Guaranteed Lenders Inc., a trade organization 
in Oklahoma that represents more than 600 SBA lenders, said the IRS 
verification was adding from two to 30 days to the application process. SBA

TEST SUGGESTS SIMPSON BLOOD AT MURDER SCENE; COURTS: FINDING IS INTRODUCED BY 
PROSECUTION AS BATTLE ESCALATES OVER DNA. DETECTIVE EXPLAINS RACIAL REMARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors and lawyers for O.J. Simpson tangled in court Monday as government 
attorneys released new test results suggesting that Simpson's blood was found 
at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of one set of DNA tests were presented to the Los Angeles County Grand 
Jury in June; they indicated that a blood drop containing identical genetic 
markers to Simpson's was found near the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and 
Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, prosecutors filed a motion in which they disclosed preliminary results 
of a more discriminating DNA test. Those results echoed the earlier findings. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, still another motion brought another development. LAPD Detective 
Mark Fuhrman, who has been accused of racism by defense lawyers, filed a 
declaration for the first time explaining racially charged remarks he made in a 
1983 pension case. 
</P>
<P>
 In his declaration, Fuhrman said he had never made derogatory remarks about 
his military colleagues or "any particular ethnic class. These statements 
attributed to me were misquoted and taken out of context. Any other racially 
insensitive comments that I may have made to (a city-hired doctor) were in the 
context of a therapeutic session and were specifically intended to refer to my 
work with violent gangs and gang members and the emotion that this stressful, 
dangerous and difficult type of police work engendered in me." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman's declaration was filed in connection with a 13-page motion urging 
Judge Lance A. Ito to deny the defense access to the detective's Marine Corps 
records. The request violates Fuhrman's right to privacy and would produce 
material that is so old it would be irrelevant, Fuhrman's lawyer Robert 
Tourtelot said in the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, meanwhile, it became increasingly evident that one of the most 
crucial and hardest-fought battles during the upcoming trial will be over the 
reliability and admissibility of DNA test results that could link Simpson to 
the stabbing deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys sought to show that prosecutors are conducting unnecessary 
and duplicative tests, using up samples that otherwise could be analyzed by 
defense experts. Prosecutors responded that they are merely ordering up the 
tests needed to show conclusively whether Simpson is the source of various 
bloodstains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it of value to you to do a number of different tests?" Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Lisa Kahn asked Gary Sims, a senior criminalist at the California Department of 
Justice lab in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Sims answered, "because that provides additional genetic information to 
answer the question as to whose blood is where." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito, who appeared to grow exasperated at times with the exhaustive defense 
questioning, is being asked to decide whether some of the samples need to be 
apportioned, or "split," so that Simpson can have his own experts analyze the 
DNA evidence. The judge did not make that decision Monday, but is expected to 
return to the topic this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion of DNA evidence in court Monday was a largely dry scientific 
debate about splitting samples, and a few of the case's leading lawyers skipped 
the session. Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman excused himself early, while 
Simpson lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran missed it altogether -- another Cochran 
client, Rep. Walter Tucker III (D-Compton), was being arraigned across the 
street on charges that he solicited bribes and then failed to pay taxes on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by half a dozen of his other lawyers, Simpson fidgeted as the session 
dragged on through the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's hearing came amid a flurry of sometimes conflicting reports of what 
preliminary DNA tests have so far shown. The issue is potentially crucial to 
the case because DNA test results could form the strongest physical evidence 
linking Simpson to the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 According to documents and sources familiar with the case, a blood drop found 
on Goldman's shoe does not match Simpson's blood, while at least two other 
samples being tested by Cellmark Diagnostics in Maryland have not yielded 
conclusive findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Those results were received by defense attorneys last week and were good news 
for Simpson -- particularly the finding that his blood is not on Goldman's 
shoe, because it would have been all but impossible for Simpson's attorneys to 
explain how their client's blood ended up on the shoe of a murder victim with 
whom he had no known relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Other preliminary DNA tests, however, have indicated that blood discovered 
inside Simpson's home and car is consistent with his blood and that blood taken 
from a trail of droplets leading away from the bodies also matches his. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those results were first reported by The Times in June, before 
Simpson's preliminary hearing, and those results later were presented to a 
grand jury that month. At that hearing, a police analyst testified that 
preliminary DNA tests of blood recovered from Simpson's Ford Bronco, the foyer 
of his house and the blood trail leading from the bodies all matched Simpson's 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, early DNA testing of blood found on a glove outside a guest house 
at Simpson's Brentwood estate showed stains consistent with the blood of both 
victims and indicated a possible mixture of his blood and that of the two 
victims, the police analyst, Collin Yamauchi, told the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the preliminary DNA test results were reiterated in a prosecution 
motion filed Monday, which noted that additional results from a more 
sophisticated type of DNA testing continue to point to Simpson as the source of 
the blood from samples discovered in his home and car, as well as from one drop 
at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution motion did not update tests being conducted on the gloves -- 
one of which was discovered at Simpson's estate and the other near the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The results detailed in the prosecution motion include preliminary findings 
from RFLP tests, a more sophisticated and discriminating type of analysis than 
PCR testing, which had produced the earlier findings. One of the RFLP tests 
shows that the banding pattern of a blood drop from the crime scene matches 
Simpson's blood, according to the prosecution motion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the RFLP tests still are not complete, the motion makes clear. 
</P>
<P>
 For the defense, the most troubling of the results so far are those suggesting 
that Simpson could be the source of the drops leading from the murder scene. 
Those drops were found to the left of bloody footprints, and Simpson had a cut 
on his left hand when interviewed by police, leading investigators to conclude 
that Simpson cut his hand while committing the murders and then dripped blood 
from that cut as he strode away from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 As a whole, "the DNA tests conducted so far implicate the defendant," 
prosecutors wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Further tests on those and other samples will be conducted in Maryland and at 
a state Department of Justice lab in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 It is those tests and the way that they are being conducted that defense 
attorneys have vigorously challenged and that they again assaulted during 
Monday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Neufeld, one of two defense legal specialists on DNA testing, questioned 
the California Department of Justice expert at length, suggesting that tests 
being conducted may needlessly risk destroying certain samples before defense 
experts can test them. Neufeld, one of the nation's premier DNA legal 
specialists, also detailed questions about handling of samples by police 
analysts -- part of the defense effort to discredit the blood samples and to 
suggest that the investigation of Simpson has been marred by sloppy work. 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld's partner, Barry Scheck, another renowned DNA lawyer, took up that 
theme later in the day, pointing out discrepancies in the reports as to the 
number and descriptions of blood samples. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on investigators forms one prong of the defense DNA challenge. But 
Simpson's attorneys also have aggressively criticized the conduct of 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald F. Uelmen, another of the athlete-turned-actor's lawyers, argued Monday 
that prosecutors have misled Simpson's camp about the status of testing. An 
inventory of samples given to defense attorneys before the preliminary hearing 
and again last week omits important information, Uelmen said. Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Marcia Clark blamed that in part on defense attorneys failing to 
understand documents provided to them, but Uelmen disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a matter of confusion," Uelmen said. "This is a matter of 
credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito appeared to be taken by surprise last week when prosecutors disclosed that 
a small number of samples had not been sent to the Maryland lab, as they had 
previously stated. Instead, those samples had been held back by the Los Angeles 
Police Department, and later were sent to the Berkeley lab, which is prepared 
to begin testing on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said last week that she too had been confused by the process and had 
thought that all of the samples were being tested in Maryland. When she learned 
of the additional samples, she notified defense attorneys and alerted them that 
the samples were being sent to Berkeley for testing there. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clark acknowledged that her assumptions about the status of testing 
had been incorrect, she also blamed defense attorneys for misreading the 
evidence inventory sheet given to them before the preliminary hearing. Defense 
attorneys had assumed the inventory list detailed all blood samples in the 
case, but Clark said Monday that the list only included samples in the 
possession of the LAPD as of June 29, the day the inventory was prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, a number of samples had been sent to Cellmark, prosecutors said. 
Those samples were not included in the inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 As they have before, attorneys for the two sides sniped at one another Monday, 
this time over a letter that Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro filed late 
Friday. In his letter, Shapiro reiterated defense allegations that prosecutors 
have misrepresented the size and location of various blood samples. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of that letter were received by news organizations before prosecutors 
or Ito had reviewed it, a fact that prompted Clark to angrily object. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the issue a "matter of grave concern," Clark said she was seeking 
guidance from Ito. "This defense practice merits serious concern as it has a 
severe impact on the right of the people to a fair trial," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark tried to vent her concerns in court, but Ito cut her off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forgive me for interrupting you, but this is a matter that I'm going to take 
up with counsel for both sides in chambers," Ito said, adding that he wanted to 
handle the matter in private and was concerned that lawyers were using hearings 
in the case to make public statements, not to influence his rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 Court is scheduled to resume at 9:30 a.m. today. Splitting the Samples 
</P>
<P>
 Samples such as blood from a crime scene are lifted with a cotton cloth, 
soaked with distilled water, sealed in a plastic bag and sent to a laboratory. 
In general, here is the way experts have testified that the samples are being 
handled by labs involved in the Simpson case: 
</P>
<P>
 LAB 1 
</P>
<P>
 A) At Maryland-based Cellmark Diagnostics, technicians use special scissors to 
cut off 10% of the samples, which are refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 B) The majority of the sample is consumed in conventional DNA testing, called 
RFLP. At Cellmark, if the RFLP test is inconclusive, then the set-aside 10% can 
be used for a PCR test, which is faster but less definitive. 
</P>
<P>
 LAB 2 
</P>
<P>
 A) At the Berkeley-based California Department of Justice lab, technicians 
have cut between 20% and 25% off a sample and set it aside. RFLP testing could 
consume the rest. BLOOD SAMPLE RFLP testing: 90% Set-aside: 10% *** 
</P>
<P>
 SIZE OF SAMPLE NEEDED 
</P>
<P>
 * RFLP requires a bloodstain about the size of a dime, while PCR can be 
conducted on one much smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether a sample is large enough to perform an RFLP test is determined by 
the molecular weight of the DNA within the sample. 
</P>
<P>
 * In this case, the samples are of varying sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 ARGUMENTS 
</P>
<P>
 PROSECUTION: Wants to perform all its testing first, then hand over set-aside 
amounts for the defense to work with. Where samples are large enough to split 
now, prosecutors have said they will share those as well. 
</P>
<P>
 DEFENSE: Wants half of all samples immediately to perform its own tests. The 
judge so far has not allowed that. 
</P>
<P>
 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TESTS: 03,20,17,23 RFLP PCR Time required: 4 to 8 weeks 
1 week Chances of identical results: 1 in 1 million 1 in 500 to 1 in 2000 
Admissibility in California courts: Some precedent, No precedent but disputed 
NOTE: Almost all samples were sent to Cellmark; a few went to the Berkeley lab 
in mid-August

RULING PARTY'S ZEDILLO CLAIMS VICTORY IN MEXICAN ELECTION; POLITICS: 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE GETTING LESS THAN 50% OF VOTE IN NARROWEST MARGIN EVER 
FOR THE PRI. IRREGULARITIES ARE REPORTED, BUT OBSERVERS DETECT NO WIDESPREAD 
FRAUD. 
</P>

<P>
 Economist Ernesto Zedillo claimed victory Monday, apparently retaining the 
ruling party's six-decade hold on the Mexican presidency but without the 
absolute majority that his predecessors have enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 His triumph -- with almost 48% of the vote in partial returns -- was the 
narrowest ever recorded by a modern candidate of his Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI). 
</P>
<P>
 But with 35.59% of the precincts reporting, Zedillo still held a big margin 
over his major rivals: Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party 
(PAN), who had 30% of the vote; and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD), with 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 The PRI also captured a significant lead in Senate elections nationwide and in 
the two governorships at stake Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling party's apparent win came as Mexico recorded a 70% voter turnout, 
the highest in this nation's history. A high turnout had been expected to favor 
opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, analysts said, the turbulence of the past year -- which began 
with an Indian uprising in the south and other violence, including the 
assassination of Zedillo's predecessor, Luis Donaldo Colosio -- persuaded 
voters not to risk a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo -- at 42, one of the youngest and least experienced politicians to 
lead Mexico in this century -- campaigned heavily on the issue of security. PRI 
bumper stickers, for example, proclaimed, "I vote for peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Mexican observer groups and international teams indicated that they 
had detected no widespread fraud in Sunday's voting, although all reported 
irregularities in spots across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the elections that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had pledged 
would be the cleanest in Mexican history generated sporadic protests Monday, 
particularly by Cardenas supporters, who asserted that there had been massive 
cheating. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a victory for the PRI of tomorrow," Zedillo said in a speech early 
Monday, when the first returns showed him with a comfortable lead. "For the PRI 
we are building with firm conviction and determination." 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo's seeming victory was widely seen as a guarantee that the free-market 
economic reforms of the past decade will continue for the next six years of his 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Zedillo promised to work for "economic growth, social advances, the 
abatement of poverty." He pledged that his government will spend more on social 
programs, admitting that the restructuring that has drawn billions of dollars 
in foreign investment to Mexico has yet to touch many of the country's poor. 
</P>
<P>
 As budget minister, Zedillo -- who earned a doctorate in economics at Yale but 
had never held elected office -- was an integral part of the economic team that 
sold off state-owned companies, slashed government subsidies and negotiated the 
North American Free Trade Agreement, solidifying this nation's commitment to 
open international markets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Mexican investors and the business community reacted strongly to 
his declaration of victory, sending stocks soaring 51 points and driving the 
peso to its strongest position against the dollar in three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists, brokers and investors were in broad agreement Monday that the 
orderly elections, whose results also seemed to please stock markets throughout 
Latin America, will hasten bricks-and-mortar investment in Mexico; there were 
indications that dollars have already been sprung loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas, who is widely believed to have been cheated of the presidency in 
1988, cried fraud again Monday to a gathering of supporters in the capital's 
main square. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group of 20,000 who cheered him in the historic Zocalo was far smaller 
than the massive crowds that rallied behind Cardenas six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "An uncommon fraud has been committed," Cardenas said with his usual deadpan 
delivery, urging his supporters to attend another demonstration Saturday after 
the final, official returns have been announced. "We still do not know the 
results," he said. "I will leave the judgment of the outcome to the Mexican 
people, not to the Congress or the (Federal) Electoral Tribunal." 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, a potentially explosive showdown was brewing in the southern state 
of Chiapas, where Cardenas' party refused to recognize the official results 
giving victory to the PRI gubernatorial candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the opposition announced a campaign of civil disobedience and 
declared the governor-elect to be Amado Avendano, a newspaper editor who 
narrowly escaped death in a suspicious traffic accident during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiapas was the site of a guerrilla uprising last January by Indians and 
peasants calling themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels had vowed to resume their struggle if the ruling party tried to win 
the elections fraudulently. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Democratic Convention -- a grouping of about 30 Indian, peasant 
and social organizations -- said that, based on their monitoring of Sunday's 
vote, Avendano had won. 
</P>
<P>
 They said a sample of 15% of the vote gave Avendano an advantage of 1 
percentage point over Eduardo Robledo of the PRI, with areas of Avendano's 
strongest support yet to be included. 
</P>
<P>
 Official results, however, gave Robledo 49% of the vote to about 31% for 
Avendano, with just over half the ballots counted. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear whether the proclamation of Avendano as 
governor-elect was merely the opposition's attempt to strengthen its bargaining 
position with the government. But it was clear that many Chiapans were angry at 
the way Sunday's elections were carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 That was true especially among Avendano supporters, who complained of numerous 
irregularities that they said prevented thousands from voting, including a 
shortage of ballots, omissions of names from voter-registration lists and 
fraudulent tallies. 
</P>
<P>
 But nationwide, Sunday's election seemed to lack the blatant, widespread 
cheating that has become a part of Mexican electoral folklore: stolen and 
stuffed ballot boxes, burned ballots and polling places that never open but 
still report returns when the polls close. 
</P>
<P>
 The most widespread irregularity reported by observers was polling places that 
opened late. 
</P>
<P>
 The most heated protests occurred when special polling places set up for 
voters in transit ran out of ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 And the most serious threat remaining, according to independent analysts, is 
the possibility of violent confrontations between police and opposition 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating Sunday's scenario was the reality that many voters, 
especially from Indian communities, cast ballots for the first time and were 
bewildered by the process. Illiteracy is high in many places in Mexico, and 
many voters relied on relatives -- in the more benign cases -- or employers and 
political bosses to tell them how to mark the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There might be some unfortunate violence, but I think they'll weather it," 
said one diplomat serving as an election observer. "Credibility hinges on one 
question: Did the PRI from the top down engineer massive, organized fraud? And 
I think the answer to that is no." 
</P>
<P>
 Doubts about this election focused on broader questions of fairness, as 
broached in a somber, early morning speech by Fernandez, the PAN candidate who 
was running second in early returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a profoundly inequitable and deeply unfair process," he said. "Once 
again, the National Action Party has confronted the machinery of the state. 
Once again we have seen with pain and shame the waste of huge resources on the 
campaign of the ruling party candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez then recited the sort of complaints that opposition candidates have 
lodged throughout the campaign, speaking of: 
</P>
<P>
 * Crowds drawn to rallies with the promise of T-shirts and lunch or the threat 
of losing their union membership. 
</P>
<P>
 * Massive expenditures, in the weeks before the election, from government 
programs to subsidize farmers and alleviate poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unbalanced media coverage, particularly from television and radio stations 
dependent on government licenses to use the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcasters did not announce Cardenas' plans for the rally in the Zocalo 
here; cable companies that carry U.S. networks blacked out American television 
coverage of the election, broadly interpreting a Federal Electoral Institute 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, opposition reaction to the election reflected Fernandez's charges 
of unfairness, which were confirmed by several observer groups and 
international visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Two U.S. groups expressed concern about "the pre-election environment" that 
favored the ruling party. Still, their overall assessment was positive, 
stressing that they were struck by "the peaceful and orderly conduct of the 
polls." 
</P>
<P>
 Some diplomats and analysts said Cardenas supporters may be ignoring an 
unpleasant reality in insisting that they lost simply because of electoral foul 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 These observers said the elections may be offering a different, clear signal 
-- a defeat for the political left. "Whether you like it or not," one diplomat 
said, "the left is being taught a lesson here." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Zedillo, he made a conscious effort Monday to downplay his apparent 
victory. He made no public appearances after his early speech; senior advisers 
said that to avoid inflaming the opposition further, Zedillo deliberately spent 
most of the day closeted in the PRI's downtown headquarters, thanking party 
rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 Until late last year, Zedillo was a little-known, seemingly dull Cabinet 
member, an able economist who helped draft Salinas' economic strategy and 
served for a time as education minister, where he was noted for bungling the 
introduction of new textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a Mexicali electrician who once worked as a shoeshine boy, Zedillo 
has an image that is more that of Yale University, which he attended on 
scholarships, than of the dusty streets of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Zedillo was named coordinator for the presidential campaign 
of Luis Donaldo Colosio, apparently to help give him political seasoning. 
Instead, that post pushed him into the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The March 23 assassination of Colosio left the PRI in shock and with limited 
prospects for a presidential contender, as Mexican law barred any serving 
Cabinet member or governor from replacing him as candidate. Salinas, however, 
employed his unique privilege as Mexico's president, tapping Zedillo from a 
limited field to be the PRI presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 He began his campaign in Colosio's shadow. But he gradually emerged as his own 
man, drawing larger and larger crowds. His infamous wooden speeches and 
gestures grew animated. He sometimes abandoned his suits for shirt sleeves and 
even appeared to enjoy mingling with crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Fernandez on Monday, he also removed himself from the public eye after 
his midnight television address. 
</P>
<P>
 His senior aides said PAN Chairman Carlos Castillo planned to spend Monday 
night with party statisticians and analysts, examining official results in 
detail to determine whether they jibed with their random poll samplings. 
</P>
<P>
 The party offered no comment on returns indicating that the PAN was trailing 
the ruling party in the three states where it has governorships.

CHILD VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLAN KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has scrapped its much-criticized plan to ship 
nearly one-third of the nation's childhood vaccines through a government-run 
warehouse in New Jersey as part of its sweeping new immunization program, 
Administration and congressional sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with intense opposition from members of Congress and pharmaceutical 
companies, the Administration has chosen to abandon the most controversial 
element of its program, which is scheduled to begin Oct. 1. The goal of the 
initiative is to increase immunization rates for preschool children. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've given up on the idea of the distribution center," said a Senate aide 
familiar with the vaccination plans. "They're looking at several other 
options." Dr. Walter A. Orenstein of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention told the Associated Press that the Administration is withdrawing its 
blueprint for the distribution system in the face of the controversy it has 
generated. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will continue to implement 
the rest of the program, which calls for the federal government to buy $500 
million in discount vaccines and distribute them free to more than 70,000 
private physicians, Orenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The physicians, in turn, will immunize Medicaid recipients who are children, 
uninsured children and Native Americans against measles, mumps, rubella, 
pertussis and polio. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has come under fire from some of Capitol Hill's leading advocates 
of increased childhood immunization. Critics, such as Sen. Dale Bumpers 
(D-Ark.), have maintained that the additional funds would be better spent on 
parental and physician education and outreach than purchasing vaccines. Critics 
have also said that the undertaking might be only marginally successful. 
</P>
<P>
 The most intense outcry was generated by the plan to ship one-third of the 
vaccines through a mammoth Burlington, N.J., facility run by the General 
Services Administration, which has no experience with such sensitive materials. 
This concern was further fueled when the General Accounting Office, the 
investigative arm of Congress, said in a report last month that the program was 
running behind schedule and questioned the GSA's ability to assure the 
integrity of the vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
 Bumpers subsequently inserted a provision in a Senate appropriations bill that 
would prohibit any money from being spent on the program until the 
Administration was able to assure Congress that it could safely and efficiently 
deliver the vaccines. It would also require the Department of Health and Human 
Services to seek bids from private firms to see if they could provide 
distribution services more cheaply than the government.

$50-MILLION COST HIKE MAY DELAY DISNEY HALL OPENING; THE ARTS: 
EARTHQUAKE-RELATED ISSUES, RISING MATERIALS COST ARE BLAMED. BACKERS TRY TO 
DEVELOP FUND-RAISING PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Walt Disney Concert Hall -- slated to open its doors in 1997 as the Music 
Center's new home for the Los Angeles Philharmonic -- will cost $50 million 
more than estimated and may be forced to open later than planned, officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Music Center officials said that although they remain confident that Disney 
Hall will be built, a delay of up to six months could occur as the project's 
supporters scramble to raise the additional funds in a troubled Los Angeles 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 If a single large donor can be found, officials said the delay could be 
shortened or avoided entirely. But, they said, a broad-based fund-raising drive 
could take much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure means that the cost of the hall, designed by Frank O. Gehry, 
will increase to about $180 million. The hall, plus a county-financed parking 
garage that is under construction, will now cost about $260 million, said Music 
Center President Shelton G. Stanfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials blamed the increased estimate on rising materials costs and two 
earthquake-related factors: tighter -- and more expensive -- post-earthquake 
building requirements for steel-frame buildings, and a dearth of competitive 
bidding for Disney Hall construction because so many companies are busy with 
earthquake repair projects throughout the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Disney Hall "the Eiffel Tower of Los Angeles," Stanfill said all 
parties involved are committed to seeing it built. "It is so important to the 
future of the Music Center, and so important to Southern California, that we 
all have to find a way to make sure it happens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said construction will not begin "unless we know we can finish it" 
-- that is, until 95% of the necessary extra funding can be raised. 
</P>
<P>
 A delay would affect the Philharmonic and the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, 
which was to expand its programming at the Music Center's Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion, now being shared by both performing arts companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanfill said he was informed last week by an ad-hoc Disney Hall advisory 
committee -- chaired by Music Center board Chairman Robert Egelston and Kent 
Kresa, Northrop Grumman Corp. chairman, that building costs had jumped 24% from 
the original $210-million projection. 
</P>
<P>
 The building costs were expected to be somewhat higher than estimated because 
of Gehry's unusual design, utilizing many curves and expensive white limestone. 
</P>
<P>
 Egelston and the other executives said they will not try to save money by 
substantially changing Gehry's dramatic design. "We're not just going to build 
another building, we are going to build the Frank Gehry concert hall," Egelston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney Hall project was instigated in 1987 by a $50-million grant from 
Lillian B. Disney, the widow of Walt Disney. After her gift, concert hall 
construction was immediately bogged down in government tie-ups and plan 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 10, 1992, groundbreaking began on the 2,500-space Disney Hall garage. 
By then, accrued interest had increased the original Disney gift to $87 million 
and the family kicked in additional funds to bring their contribution to $93 
million. County contributions and a gift from Toyota brought in additional 
funds, and the Music Center planned to raise another $17.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Music Center officials said they plan to meet soon with the county, 
the Disney family and other players in Disney Hall to determine a plan for 
raising additional funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney family members and their representatives could not immediately be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Music Center -- the fund-raising arm of the center's resident performing 
arts companies -- remains committed to raising at least $17.5 million in 
support of the hall. The executives added that the Los Angeles Philharmonic has 
been and will remain active in seeking new fund-raising sources for Disney 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Stanfill said, the Music Center missed its fund-raising goal of 
$12.75 million, raising $11.5 million for its resident companies and programs. 
He added that those results are pending an independent audit. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the Music Center has been plagued with fund-raising 
difficulties, including an embarrassing 1991 incident in which the Music Center 
announced that it had met its $17.6-million goal, then was forced to admit that 
it had fallen $1.3 million short and had to borrow $3 million to cover its 
shortfall. Since then, the fund-raising goal has declined each year because of 
the weak economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanfill said the Music Center's other projects, including the $17.1-million 
reconfiguration of its Ahmanson Theater, will not be affected by Disney Hall's 
financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Philharmonic spokesman Stephen Belth said: "We certainly are concerned and 
watching carefully to be able to plan our opening season at Disney Hall. We're 
confident that one day soon, we will be playing there. . . . We believe that 
those charged with bringing in the necessary financing will do so. At least, we 
hope they will." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Hemmings, executive director of Music Center Opera, said: "This doesn't 
come as a complete surprise to us; we have been aware of problems recently. 
(But) we are confident that the Disney Hall will open in due course. . . . 
Until that time, we shall continue to share, as we have done for the past eight 
years. Although it is not ideal, it is workable."

HEALTH REFORM VOTE MAY HANG ON SENATE RECESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN and KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even as the Senate took a break from health care reform to debate crime 
legislation, some Democratic members Monday privately joined Republicans in 
calling for a delay in the health debate, according to White House and 
congressional sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said that Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) is likely to 
grant a recess -- possibly starting this week and lasting until after the Labor 
Day weekend -- if he can get commitments from at least 60 senators that they 
will vote to enact major legislation upon their return. Sixty votes would be 
needed to overcome any filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
 Many reform-minded members, however, are warning that a significant break in 
the health care debate would sap any remaining momentum from the drive to enact 
major legislation before Congress adjourns in early October. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we go home, health care is dead," said Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's right," said Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.). "I 
say, let's not go home. Let's go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell also did not budge from his public stance that the current debate 
over the crime bill is all the respite that the Senate will get from 
consideration of health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democratic senators said Monday that the sentiment is growing for a 
hiatus. The Senate was to have begun a monthlong recess in mid-August, but it 
was canceled by Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 Senators cited several reasons for the growing clamor for a break -- most 
notably the strong desire to return home to campaign for reelection. One-third 
of the Senate's seats are up for election. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are also a lot of people who have made non-refundable family vacation 
plans and can't afford to lose (the money)," said one senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, only Republicans have called for a recess, led by Minority Leader 
Bob Dole of Kansas and Phil Gramm of Texas. Dole also told a group of friendly 
lobbyists during a hallway encounter Thursday that he is searching for "hard 
votes . . . on the (Democratic) side so we can kill the Mitchell bill and go 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), appearing on CBS's "Face the 
Nation," also raised the possibility of a break. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the Senate had engaged in nearly two weeks of desultory debate on 
health care reform with no real progress, the Finance Committee chairman said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Now maybe it's time to break and see if we can't put together a bill that has 
enough of the common ingredients of the various groups to get 60 votes." 
</P>
<P>
 That suggestion was said to be "gaining traction" in the Senate Monday, a top 
White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The House already has put off its health care debate indefinitely, with 
Democratic leaders there citing the delay in getting analysis of the various 
reform proposals from the Congressional Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democratic senators raised the possibility of a recess during a private 
meeting Monday and, when Mitchell was asked about it, "the look in his eyes was 
perplexing," said one pro-reform senator who was there. 
</P>
<P>
 Various groups of senators also met in private throughout the day to discuss 
the latest reform proposal, offered Friday by a bipartisan group of about 20 
members as an alternative to Mitchell's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "mainstream coalition" proposed a drastically stripped-down bill 
that would eliminate the requirement that employers pay part of their workers' 
health care premiums and that would trim $400 billion from growth of Medicare 
and Medicaid over 10 years to generate funds to help poor people buy health 
insurance. It optimistically aims to achieve 95% coverage by the year 2002, 
which would be an improvement of about 10 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal's goals would fall far short of those set forth by President 
Clinton and embraced by his congressional allies. But many of them emerged from 
meetings Monday praising parts of the "mainstream" proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockefeller said he could not vote for the proposal in its present form, but 
added that it has "some very good parts," such as giving priority to covering 
pregnant women and children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps the process moving," added Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) "I think we are 
going to grind it out." A delay, he said, would endanger the entire effort. 
</P>
<P>
 But hard-line advocates of universal coverage were discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't hear a thing about universal coverage . . . " said Sen. Russell D. 
Feingold (D-Wis.). "It's an awful long way from what we campaigned on." 
</P>
<P>
 A critical issue is the extent to which the "mainstream" group is willing to 
make concessions. But the senators who met with the group said they could not 
get a clear answer on that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockefeller said he thinks Republican members of the group are willing to 
negotiate. "The question is, how far is their leash?" 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the private pressures from some Democrats for a recess, many hard-line 
reformers Monday vigorously opposed any such break. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is joined and I think we ought to go for it," Sen. John Glenn 
(D-Ohio) said, adding: "If that means I have to change my Christmas Eve plans, 
then so be it." 
</P>

COLUMN ONE; THE NEW CULTURAL FRONTIER; MORE PUBLISHERS, PAINTERS AND 
PLAYWRIGHTS ARE MOVING TO THE HIGH-TECH HUBS OF THE WEST. THIS TALENT MIGRATION 
IS CHANGING THE WAY AMERICA'S ART AND IDEAS ARE CREATED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Think encyclopedias and you think of Oxford dons in flowing gowns and the 
tweedy world of New York publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 But what you really should be thinking is: Redmond, Wash. That's the home of 
Microsoft Corp., whose Encarta CD-ROM encyclopedia, replete with video and 
sound, has become the world's best-selling encyclopedia in its first year on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden ascendance of Encarta is more than just another indication that the 
electronic information age has arrived. To many, it's a sign of a changing 
intellectual landscape, one in which the information-technology outposts of the 
West are quietly becoming hubs of thought and creativity as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "New York used to be the center of the information industry," says Tom 
Corddry, one of Microsoft's multimedia gurus. "But electronic publishing could 
be based on the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Encarta. The encyclopedia has already made Microsoft a major player 
in the knowledge business, giving it a pivotal role in deciding just what these 
essential references contain, how they behave and what they do. 
</P>
<P>
 Encarta is so successful that Microsoft, whose forte has been computer 
programs, doesn't just create the coding for the CD-ROM. It also hires writers, 
editors and artists to produce original material, then handles distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the medium doesn't only help shape the message. It also helps 
determine from where the message comes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody is saying New York is about to disappear as a center of ideas, or that 
Los Angeles will soon lose its grip on movie and TV production. But there are 
strong signs that changing technologies are starting to redraw the nation's 
cultural map. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like painters had to be in New York in the '60s and Paris in the '20s, 
if you want to rub (your) mind with people in these disciplines, you have to 
be" in the West, says Bob Bell, a professor at San Francisco State University's 
multimedia center, which offers courses to thousands of professionals each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are getting painters, artists, writers, designers moving here because of 
employment opportunities," Bell says. 
</P>
<P>
 New media technologies are evolving extremely rapidly. Taking advantage of the 
latest advances requires close interaction among musicians, artists, writers 
and computer experts. The technical wizards and creative professionals most 
attuned to the new media tend to be concentrated in the West Coast's major 
metropolitan centers -- notably the San Francisco Bay Area, the Northwest and 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an exciting time and place. We're shaping something new," says Amy 
Satron, who recently left Apple Computer to develop multimedia texts for 
Wadsworth Publishing, a San Francisco textbook company. The concentration of 
talent "is leading to outcomes that wouldn't otherwise be possible," says 
Satron, whose husband is working on a multimedia product for Amnesty 
International, the human rights watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 4,500 members of the International Interactive Communications Society, 
a group of multimedia professionals based in Beaverton, Ore., close to half are 
in San Francisco or Los Angeles. New York has 357 members. 
</P>
<P>
 This melding of the technically literate and the artistically inclined is 
generating a cultural phenomenon some like to call techno-bohemian -- 
techno-boho, for short. It's a peculiar amalgam of 1960s hippiedom and 1980s 
capitalism, suffused with the very 1990s notion that technology is making 
possible entirely new forms of artistic expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Haukom, a San Francisco-based multimedia producer, finds the term 
techno-boho pretentious. But he sees in the local multimedia community a broad 
recognition of the new medium's expressive power. The ability to mix words, 
sounds and images, and give people the power to control them in novel ways, he 
says, also has great potential for social good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some see multimedia as a literary genre; some will use it as an art form," he 
says. "I think it's the most phenomenal educational technology ever invented." 
</P>
<P>
 Migrations of talent have occurred throughout history as national fortunes 
changed and technologies evolved. Driven by the desire for more clear days for 
shooting, the American movie industry moved west from New York generations ago, 
dragging a goodly sum of intellectual capital in its wake. Beginning in the 
1920s, waves of writers -- including Hemingway, Faulkner and Fitzgerald -- were 
drawn by the high pay and excitement of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, of the 11,000 members of the Writers Guild -- the union that covers 
movies, television and radio -- 7,500 live on the West Coast, about 5,600 of 
them in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And, although publishing and the fine arts remain based in New York City, the 
rise of universities as patrons of the arts long ago dispersed writers and 
other creative talent around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 By their nature, the newer, more outdoorsy and less densely populated cities 
of the West do not have the intellectual maturity or intensity of Paris or New 
York in their heyday. Perhaps they never will. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are cultural centers of a different sort, drawing energy from 
technological innovation and social change rather than from tradition. More 
like Hollywood than Greenwich Village, these communities are driven as much by 
a desire for worldly success and a search for a better quality of life as by 
the yearning for artistic fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
 Multimedia companies find cities in the West have the best selection of people 
with both technical and artistic talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton's NewMedia, formerly a subsidiary of Britannica and now owned by the 
Chicago Tribune Co., established itself in Carlsbad, north of San Diego, rather 
than at its parent's base in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many people would be willing to move to Chicago?" Tom McGrew, Compton's 
vice president of marketing development and product planning, asks 
rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California was ideal, he says, because of the graphic designers, 
musicians and cartoonists attached to the movie industry. A new multimedia 
title called "Rescue the Scientist," for example, will feature a television 
star to help in the marketing battle for scarce shelf space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want programmers with an aesthetic sense," says Greg Roach, who recently 
moved his multimedia company, Hyperbole, to Seattle from Houston. His recent 
hires in Seattle include a programmer who is also a sculptor and another who is 
a drummer in a rock band. 
</P>
<P>
 A former playwright, Roach began working in new media after he found himself 
writing plays that involved sets exploding into flames and other fantastic 
scenes he could not afford to produce. "In the computer I can do all those 
things," says Roach, who is widely recognized as a leader in advancing 
multimedia as an art form. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent morning, Roach was in a small studio on the edge of the city 
directing three actors through his next interactive movie, a futuristic story 
in which the Earth's survival depends on mining of a rare material that would 
require destroying the native tribe of a faraway planet. The only set was a 
backdrop painted cobalt blue. A sci-fi city would be "created" -- programmed in 
later -- using computer modeling tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The setup may look amateurish and the script is sometimes hackneyed, but Roach 
is convinced that the new medium will find a major place in the pantheon of 
high culture. "It's a 'B' interactive movie," Roach admits. "But we are 
positioning ourselves; we are learning the craft." 
</P>
<P>
 Artists are not the only ones moving to where the action is. East Coast 
publishers, afraid of being left behind, are testing the waters by buying up or 
pairing up with technology companies in the West. Random House and Novato, 
Calif.-based Broderbund Software are in a joint venture to publish interactive 
children's books. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture combines Broderbund's production skills with Random House's 
library, which includes the Dr. Seuss, "Berenstain Bears" and "Babar" series of 
children's books. The Washington Post Co. recently purchased Mammoth Micro 
Productions, the Seattle firm that helped put together a quarterly version of 
the Post's Newsweek magazine on CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 With their control over what's known in the trade as "content," publishers 
still have the potential of pulling the focus of multimedia development back to 
their home base in New York. But their success depends on their ability to 
translate print-based products into the electronic medium. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the New York publishers have been largely unsuccessful, criticized 
instead for producing "shovelware" that does little more than dump printed 
words onto CD-ROM discs with the addition of a few pictures. Books such as 
Michael Crichton's "Jurassic Park" that are put on CD-ROM with added pictures 
and sound -- or "repurposed" -- have not sold well. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can buy (Dr. Seuss') 'One Fish, Two Fish' for $6.99 (in print), would 
you pay $49.95 for the CD-ROM?" asks Shelley Day, chief executive at Humongous 
Entertainment, a Seattle company that produces a successful series of original 
children's titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tradition-bound publishers -- many still insist that writers submit 
manuscripts on paper instead of on computer disk -- tend to be slow to adapt to 
new technology, putting them at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to take them two years to get a book out," recalls Rick Smolan, a 
former Time photographer, who used to publish his "Day in the Life" coffee 
table picture books from an office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 When Smolan approached his New York publishers years ago about developing 
CD-ROMs, they gave him a blank look. "They all have directors of multimedia, 
but few are doing anything," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Smolan uses the latest in computer equipment to publish his books in five 
months. They are accompanied by CD-ROM titles that allow readers to more fully 
explore the themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people still find New York alluring. "There's a greater concentration of 
writers, artists and musicians; it's a richer soup," says Robert Stein, 
development director at Voyager, a multimedia company that recently moved to 
New York from Santa Monica. "San Francisco is all hardware and money." 
</P>
<P>
 And as new technology makes it easier for non-technical people to develop 
multimedia titles, the multimedia business may become more dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, the staying power of these new multimedia centers depends on 
the future of the technology and society's ultimate desire to adapt to a new 
way of projecting ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are skeptical. "Books have been around for 400 to 500 years for a good 
reason," says Michael Powell, owner of Powell's in Portland, Ore., the nation's 
largest bookstore. "They are hard to improve upon." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin Kernan, a Princeton professor and author of "The Death of Literature," 
believes that multimedia will prove to be an extension of television, computers 
and the other electronic media that have gradually replaced books as sources of 
information and entertainment -- and he mourns the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Although CD-ROMs may evolve into an art form with more intellectual content 
than movies or TV, Kernan says, "it won't be literature." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sitting and reading encourages a complex sense of truth and reality." With 
greater use of images in TV, movies and CD-ROMs, he says, "you don't need so 
much thought to understand what is in front of you." 
</P>
<P>
 But others see multimedia's ability to transmit ideas and information through 
the use of interactive programs as an important advantage over print in areas 
such as educational texts, reference works and documentary-style nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever reason, Americans are turning to the new medium in huge numbers. 
Last year, 5.5 million families owned multimedia computers. Simba Information 
Inc., a market research and publishing company in Wilton, Conn., predicts the 
number will rise to 17 million by the end of 1995. CD-ROM title sales, 
excluding games, quadrupled to $300 million last year, according to Dataquest, 
a San Jose market research firm. It expects sales to triple this year. 
</P>
<P>
 As multimedia titles become available not only on CD-ROM but also through 
on-line computer services and eventually interactive television, the number of 
potential customers for new titles will soar. 
</P>
<P>
 Economics also favor electronic publishing in important areas. The Encarta 
encyclopedia, which sells for $70, costs $2 per copy to manufacture. A set of 
the World Book Encyclopedia costs $150 to print and huge sums to market and 
distribute. That means, over time, Microsoft will have more money than its 
print counterparts to spend on commissioning fresh work from artists and 
writers. Microsoft has long been buying up rights to artwork around the world 
to use with its products. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, new media titles haven't made money for most developers. The average 
multimedia firm has up to three people and brings in revenues under $50,000 a 
year, according to a Dataquest survey. Many depend on corporate presentations 
for their bread and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having to waiter to support yourself as an actor," says Bruce Ryon, 
principal in charge of multimedia research at Dataquest. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft, however, has gone straight for the starring role. The company has 
pledged to produce 100 consumer titles by next year and is investing big money 
in the business. Programmers accustomed to discipline and logical clarity are 
paired with ethno-musicologists and designers who deal in the intangible. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to go back and forth between what is desirable and what is 
possible," says Corddry, who has found himself mediating between these 
disparate worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a publishing executive, I would look at Microsoft and be shaking in 
my boots," says Paul Saffo, director of the Menlo Park-based Institute for the 
Future think tank. "They have piles of money; they are motivated to do 
something in this market, and they are ruthless."

RUSSIAN PSYCHE IS SLOWLY SHEDDING SOVIET SHACKLES; REFORMS: EIGHT YEARS AFTER

REMAINS.

 "I squeeze the slave out of myself drop by drop."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Anton Chekhov 
</P>
<P>
 Tatyana A. Yegorova used to epitomize the surliness, sloth and inefficiency 
for which the Soviet worker was infamous. 
</P>
<P>
 Spare parts could never seem to be retrieved from the storeroom she supervised 
at the Neftemash pump-manufacturing plant. According to her boss, the 
prevailing attitude among the workers was, "That's not my job," "Why should I 
work more than everyone else?" and "There's nothing I can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yegorova is disturbed by the changes that have swept Russia in the three years 
since a failed coup shattered the Soviet Union. Yet on the job, she embraces a 
new work ethic. She and her clerks recently asked for a computer to help keep 
track of their inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't do things sloppily at home," Yegorova said. "Now I've started doing 
things at work like I do them at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years after glasnost began cracking the rigid Soviet system, the 
historic changes in Russia's economy and political life are hard to miss. And 
beneath the skin of this deeply troubled society, an equally profound and 
painful process is gradually reshaping the psyche of Russia's people. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saratov, a 16th-Century merchant city on the banks of the Volga River, 
Soviet-think is fading. But the residual Soviet mentality still slows reform. 
Thousands of workers at the city's mammoth, dying defense plants cling to their 
jobs -- though they have not worked or been paid for months -- hoping that the 
state will bail them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Russians feel suddenly vulnerable as they realize that their government 
will no longer provide the sweeping social guarantees that Soviet citizens 
considered a birthright. Gone is the totalitarian state that supervised 
everything from how many pumps Neftemash manufactured to what Yegorova's son 
did in Communist Party-sponsored summer camp -- a state that also promised 
lifelong security in return for unquestioning obedience to the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Into the power vacuum left by the party have rushed despotic local 
authorities, tyrannical bureaucrats and predatory mobsters. All three exploit 
the legal and psychological weaknesses of a people trained for centuries to bow 
before the strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the independence of mind that is an essential prerequisite for 
real self-rule is slowly taking root. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you create the conditions for initiative, you will get it," said Andrei A. 
Laptev, a former economics professor who is Neftemash's deputy director for 
economics. "Initiative was always there, but people just got frustrated and 
gave up." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to boost productivity, the factory is introducing a system of 
merit pay based on performance reviews. Managers are attending evening classes 
in free-market business administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The change-or-die attitude took hold as the factory's work force shrank from 
1,200 to 900, Laptev said. Goaded by a pro-market management, its workers 
realized that the lovely socialist job guarantees were meaningless and that the 
Russian government is too broke to bail out failing factories even if it wants 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most workers have adapted, Laptev said, Yegorova and her colleagues 
say their lives have become much more stressful, financially and 
psychologically. 
</P>
<P>
 Yegorova, an ample, gentle-faced 45-year-old, says life was better under 
communism. She can vote now and feels free to voice political opinions with 
impunity. But she says the new freedoms have not given her the power to 
exercise real control over her life. 
</P>
<P>
 To Yegorova, freedom would mean being able to walk the streets at night 
without fear and being able to buy what she needs at the market without 
counting her kopecks. 
</P>
<P>
 She is now a shareholder in her factory, which sells its pumps to the oil and 
gas industry. But she is also her family's sole breadwinner, because her 
husband and son have been laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt freer before," Yegorova said. "I can't travel. I have no money. I 
can't go out on the street at night. And I can't afford to buy anything. I have 
to suppress myself all the time now." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Laptev, the reformist manager, nor Yegorova, the worker forced to 
reform, would turn the clock back. But Yegorova did admit to being nostalgic 
for a time when everything seemed simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under Big Brother, all of life was arranged so that you had no real choice," 
said educator Mikhail V. Klarin. "Now that the strict regulations are being 
lifted, many people are at a loss. People say: 'At least before, we knew what 
was good and what was bad. Now we have no guidelines. . . . We don't know what 
to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, though Big Brother is dead, his legacy lingers in the hearts and 
minds of many Russians. Dismantling the Soviet system means not only 
establishing civil and economic freedom but also freeing people from the 
psychologically paralyzing habits of totalitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, it is now common to assert, with all the intense gloom that the 
Russian intellectual can muster, that it will take generations to purge society 
of its fatalism, apathy, fear, envy, lack of personal initiative and slavish 
obedience to authority. Those attitudes were essential to survive under the 
czarist and Soviet systems, but they hobble Russia's development today, 
observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way out of slavery to freedom is just as difficult as the road from 
freedom to slavery," said psychiatrist and author Aron I. Belkin. "Deep in our 
hearts, we remain slaves of totalitarianism, just as in the past. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Moreover, the people don't want to leave slavery," he said. "They liked it. 
Someone else thought for you. You were not paid much, but at the same time, 
nothing special was demanded of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its collectivist tradition, post-Soviet Russia has embraced individual 
rights and Western values in theory. But it has not yet sorted out just how 
much unbridled individualism it can stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, there is freedom for speculators, freedom for gangsters, freedom for 
destroyers," nationalist painter Ilya Glazunov said in an interview from his 
antiques- and icon-crammed studio in Moscow. Sounding a persistent theme of the 
Russian right, the controversial artist warned that whatever Russian spiritual 
grandeur survived communism is now being corrupted by a malevolent wave of 
Western consumer culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are becoming a colony of America," Glazunov said. 
</P>
<P>
 This view is not mainstream. But across Russia, people are arguing about 
whether freedom has a downside. Clearly, the collapse of communism has 
triggered a crisis of values. 
</P>
<P>
 All that the Soviet Union considered evil -- greed, conspicuous consumption, 
commercialism and the glorification of the individual over the collective good 
-- is suddenly in vogue, people complain. 
</P>
<P>
 All that was seen as noble -- idealism, disdain for money, egalitarianism and 
self-sacrifice in order to build a just, communist society -- now seems naive 
and dated. 
</P>
<P>
 People wail that what was billed as "freedom" has degenerated into a 
free-for-all. Those willing to break the law and trample their comrades get 
rich quick, they say, while "decent, modest, law-abiding" people have grown 
poorer and more powerless. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in Saratov, a city in the spiritual and economic heart of Russia, the 
mood is less gloomy than these generalizations would suggest. In this 
provincial capital far from Moscow, people have been forced to fend for 
themselves. The sense of self-reliance is palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that we, like the Jews, need to wander for 40 years in the 
desert -- having first created the desert for ourselves," said Alexei I. 
Slapovsky, a novelist and dramatist who has experienced a surge of personal 
creativity and success since the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen an amazing ability to change, even among the older generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Just three years ago, when food was in short supply and what little there was 
in the state stores was often rotting, clerks used to berate buyers who tried 
to rummage through the vegetable bins for decent carrots. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to take all the best ones for yourself!" a saleswoman would snap 
indignantly. "What am I going to give the next person?" 
</P>
<P>
 For 70 years, a communal ethos of "share and suffer alike" meant that a person 
who openly pursued individual interests -- even in putting palatable food on 
the table -- was considered selfish, shameless, even antisocial. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Saratov's markets are overflowing with fresh food. Customers now scurry 
from stall to stall to find the least exorbitant prices. Buyers can haggle, and 
bruised fruit sells at a discount. 
</P>
<P>
 Saratov is a conservative city that was closed tight to foreigners until 1992. 
Ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky was the top vote-getter here in the 
1993 parliamentary elections, and a local candidate who promised to protect 
ethnic Russians from darker-skinned traders from the Caucasus also won handily. 
</P>
<P>
 These ethnic and political tensions are more subtle than the riot of color, 
smell, grime, crime and hustle that has made the city livelier -- and more 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the city's main strolling arcade, dozens of private stores are thriving. 
The traditional unmitigated Russian contempt for "speculators" -- a term that 
has come to mean anyone who sells what he has not made himself and is applied 
with special contempt to non-Russians -- does not stop people from snapping up 
the shops' wares. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Saratov's economic woes, business on the main street is booming. There 
is an Yves Rocher French cosmetics store, a Swiss snack shop, a private art 
gallery -- and the smell of unabashed commercialism in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Casinos have opened up along the beaches of the Volga, where vacationing 
businessmen sip imported beer and deafen themselves with mega-decibel American 
rap music. 
</P>
<P>
 And in downtown Saratov, a newly consecrated Russian Orthodox nun has set up a 
small shop of religious materials in the center of a store that sells the 
consumer wares now produced by Saratov's aviation and defense plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers peruse Mother Yefrosiniya's collection of icons, Bibles and prayer 
books before walking over to see whether Saratov's own rototillers, coffee 
grinders, microwave ovens and toasters are a better buy than the Japanese- and 
South Korean-made goods that have recently flooded the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling icons is a job for which Mother Yefrosiniya is uniquely qualified. For 
34 years, she was a saleswoman in a food store. Now her profits go to rebuild 
her convent and restore Saratov's churches, one of which had been turned into a 
planetarium. 
</P>
<P>
 Mother Yefrosiniya's son is a police captain and nonbeliever. To his mother, 
freedom came with the knowledge that her decision to become a nun would no 
longer pose a threat to his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom of religion, speech and travel are now treated as matter-of-fact. So 
is intellectual freedom, a precious commodity in a city that boasts a rich 
pre-revolutionary tradition of art, theater, scholarship and belles-lettres. 
</P>
<P>
 At Saratov's 110-year-old Radishchev Art Museum, Yefim I. Vodonos, curator of 
the Russian art collection, has no nostalgia for the old regime. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls a museum director who was driven from his job in the bad old days 
for trying to force his curators to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Flouting the Soviet maxim "We pretend to work, and they pretend to pay us," 
the director wanted his staff "not just to show up at their desks, but to write 
lectures, to give tours," Vodonos said. The put-upon proletariat quickly 
conspired to have the boss ousted. 
</P>
<P>
 Vodonos grouses that this anti-work ethic persists at the museum today. But to 
him, what matters more is that he can now display his religious art, his 
Impressionist collection and even several paintings by Kazimir Malevich and 
Wassily Kandinsky, works that were politically incorrect and once even slated 
for destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Saratov's people scoff at the notion that the civil rights and 
liberties "guaranteed" by the 8-month-old Russian constitution will be 
implemented anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 They still believe their telephones are tapped, though they wonder whether the 
revamped KGB has the manpower to listen to the conversations. They complain 
that gangsters are growing stronger, that the government is corrupt and 
unresponsive, that the bureaucratic mind is impossible to change. 
</P>
<P>
 But life goes on in spite of the government, the bureaucrats and the mob. 
Emboldened, more and more people ignore or defy them. And this is perhaps the 
most profound psychological change of all in a nation with a thousand-year 
tradition of autocracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Russians must still be wary of another ancient tradition, though: the envy of 
their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 When writer Slapovsky won an international literary award last year, he was 
stunned that the prize money was enough to buy the ultimate international 
capitalist status symbol: a Mercedes-Benz. Then he realized that the mob would 
quickly take it away from him. So he has nicknamed his old bicycle "my 
Mercedes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Life has become multicolored, in the good and the bad sense," he said. "Our 
lives have widened." 
</P>
<P>
 With no more Communist Party to skewer, Slapovsky has turned to poking fun at 
the foibles of the Russian nouveaux riches . He likes to mock their penchant 
for such English words as OK , office and racketeer , ideas for which the 
Russian language already has a fine lexicon. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is funny is the hurry we are in," he said. "We are in a great hurry to 
become something other than what we are. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it is dangerous to betray oneself," he added. "But one must change 
every day."

IN CUBA, IT IS A TIME OF YOUNG MEN AND THE SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 La Gaviota is a graceless homemade rowboat of ill-sawed timber and tired green 
canvas that will never look like its seagull namesake. But on the rocky beach 
here Monday, six friends labored mightily to make their craft seaworthy -- for 
they plan to bet their lives on it. This morning they almost certainly will be 
between hope and desperation in the Florida Straits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the chronicle of a failing revolution, it is a time of the young men and 
the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramshackle Cojimar, a short ride east of Havana, is Ernest Hemingway's old 
haunt, but as a focus now of an unrelenting exodus of rafters fleeing Cuba, it 
is pure Gabriel Garcia Marquez: The impossible has become the routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "So who's braver?" asked a bony old woman in an unlikely black wig. "Those who 
leave in boats that should never set sail, or we who stay?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago -- only a few days ago -- it was a crime to leave Cuba without 
official permission. For a long time -- three decades -- the United States 
welcomed Cubans who succeeded in their flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, feuding anew with Washington, the Cuban government offers carte blanche 
to anyone who wants to float away in anything that is not stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only if there are young children aboard do the police intervene. The Coast 
Guard will actually point you in the right direction," said one hopeful 
backyard boat-builder named Hector, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody on Cojimar beach Monday knew that American policy changed last week, 
that Washington is sending out the fleet and pitching tents in detention camps. 
</P>
<P>
 No importa . Nobody cares. The thirst to flee unpursued is all-consuming here 
and at countless other beaches along Cuba's long northern coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 It is fueled by one dramatic fact: Big Brother is not watching. Even better, 
Big Brother is watching but doesn't give a damn. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been enough subversive shipwrights on Cojimar beach in recent days, 
in full view of a nearby Cuban Coast Guard station, to have judges working 
overtime in previous times. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my only chance. I'll float around for a month until somebody picks us 
up if I have to. If the Americans detain me, fine. I'm going," said a young man 
with a gold earring and long curls, hammering at La Gaviota. 
</P>
<P>
 Esteban, a wiry black man with work-hardened hands and one-sixth interest in 
the boat, grunted his agreement. "I'll eat better in an American jail than I do 
here. And sooner or later they'll have to let me go. What crime is it to flee 
the unlivable?" 
</P>
<P>
 Under the sun, the six friends worked with hammer and pliers and great 
ingenuity to fashion an awkward outrigger. An encouraging crowd gathered to 
watch, leaning against Chinese-made bicycles with evocative names like Phoenix 
and Flying Pigeon. Many in the crowd looked as if they were going too, and some 
said as much. 
</P>
<P>
 One fat woman waddled up under a parasol to contribute to the flight of The 
Seagull -- a single nail. A man in a bright bathing suit who had come to sell a 
compass pulled a military-looking instrument from a pouch and pointed 
importantly: "That's north. You have to steer a few degrees to the east," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much do you want for the compass?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Three hundred dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 The good-natured crowd swirled around La Gaviota in a cross-age, cross-gender, 
cross-race egalitarianism that is a Cuban hallmark. A few weeks ago, such beach 
theater would have been impossible to imagine. By now, everybody is an expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are coming day and night now. Yesterday I counted 76 from this beach 
alone," said one pimply youth with wanderlust writ large. 
</P>
<P>
 A blonde woman sashayed along the beach, smiling winsomely at raft builders, 
waving a bottle that she offered to contribute for a ride out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman came back from where two rafters in bathing suits waded ashore 
from a contraption that seemed mostly one large leak. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got scared out there, and now they want to sell the boat for $30. Some 
nerve," she scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beach's edge, a vendor sold peanuts and lollipops. Above him, a BBC 
television crew filmed rafts already at sea and those, like La Gaviota, waiting 
for nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 One party of eight would-be Miamians rested in the cool shade next to a 
catamaran that they had finely and precisely crafted from insulation material 
intended for refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's called Libertad, and it's not for sale," said the eldest of the eight, 
rebuffing a would-be buyer. Nearby, a two-oil-drum raft scraped ashore a few 
miles from where it had been launched, its disconsolate captain unable to make 
it sail. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the rafters came, Cojimar, pronounced co-HE-mar, was best known to 
outsiders as the fishing village near where Ernest Hemingway lived and where he 
found the inspiration and the characters for his novel "The Old Man and the 
Sea." 
</P>
<P>
 A colonnaded park with a bust of the writer is one of the few fresh-painted 
buildings in town, across from a Cuban Coast Guard station in a old colonial 
fortress where sailors with binoculars tracked the procession of rafts moving 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 "Papa (Hemingway) used to lean against this pillar when he drank. If he also 
ate, it was at that table over there in the corner," said a bartender, too 
young to remember, at La Terraza restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an oil painting of Hemingway there, and a striking portrait in copper 
of the bearded hand-line fisherman named Anselmo, a Cojimar institution for 
decades, on whom Hemingway modeled the novel's hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything about him was old except his eyes," reads an inscription that 
Hemingway wrote in another Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, such echoes from the old are hostage to staccato intrusion from the 
new. Lunch at La Terraza on Monday came to the strains of breakneck physical 
labor by four young men on the patio of the building next door. They were 
building a raft.

U.S. PLAN TO OPEN VIETNAM OFFICE MARKS FIRST STEP TO FULL RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States will open a diplomatic mission in Vietnam this autumn, 19 
years after the chaotic evacuation of its diplomats at the end of the Vietnam 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials are awaiting Vietnamese approval to open a Hanoi liaison office 
in September or October, and are considering a three-story, French-style 
residence for a future ambassador, sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the nine-story glass building for the liaison office was 
completed last month by a Vietnamese company. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. presence in Hanoi would encourage American visitors and Vietnamese, 
especially the young, who want to visit the United States. Travel for 
Vietnamese now is restricted to a small number of students and diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
 The liaison office is the first step toward full diplomatic relations, once 
the United States is satisfied Vietnam has done everything it can to help 
account for Americans missing from the war. Hanoi is to open its own liaison 
office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States closed its consulate in Hanoi in 1955, when Washington 
refused to recognize the Communist North Vietnamese government that defeated 
French troops and ended colonial rule the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. diplomats left Vietnam in April, 1975, fleeing their Saigon embassy after 
the North defeated the U.S.-allied South Vietnamese government. 
</P>
<P>
 The new 11-member U.S. mission will handle MIA issues, human rights, trade and 
economics. It will help American citizens arrested in Vietnam -- a major 
concern of U.S. visitors, particularly Vietnamese Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 It also will provide services for U.S. business people, and for Vietnamese 
business people, students and officials traveling to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The building under consideration as an ambassador's residence is occupied by 
Vietnam's Press Center, which provides translators, guides and other services 
to foreign reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The former U.S. consulate building is now the headquarters of the Hanoi 
Fatherland Front, a political body intended to prevent efforts to overthrow the 
Communist leadership.

EX-AIDE SUES CONROY FOR HARASSMENT; LAWSUIT: WOMAN SAYS O.C. ASSEMBLYMAN FIRED 
HER AFTER SHE COMPLAINED ABOUT SEXUAL ADVANCES. HE DENIES ALLEGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy, the Orange County lawmaker who captured national 
headlines recently with a bill to paddle juvenile graffiti vandals, has been 
accused in a lawsuit of sexually harassing and wrongfully firing a former 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Robyn Boyd, a former part-time legislative clerk in Conroy's office, accused 
the Republican from Orange of subjecting her to "uninvited and unwelcome" 
harassment, as well as an office environment replete with off-color jokes, 
leering, innuendo and sexual advances, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy denied the allegations, saying in a one-page statement that Boyd's 
complaints resulted from "unfortunate misunderstandings" and that his office 
"addressed those matters by taking immediate corrective action where 
appropriate." He said he would refrain from further comment until the case is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed in Amador County last March, but is being transferred 
this week to Sacramento County. Carolee Kilduff, Boyd's attorney, said the 
complaint, which seeks unspecified monetary damages, was filed in the 
neighboring county to avoid publicity while settlement negotiations were 
underway with the Assembly Rules Committee, which is also named as a plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd, 35, is seeing a psychiatrist for emotional problems she alleges she has 
suffered as a result of the harassment, Kilduff said. Although the lawsuit 
contends Boyd was essentially terminated from her job, officials in the 
Legislature said she was on unpaid administrative leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilduff said Boyd has a master's degree in communicative hearing disorders but 
came to Conroy's office in 1993 seeking a career change. Her goal was to help 
write legislation pertaining to the health field, the attorney said. Conroy 
sits on the Assembly Health Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit said Boyd was told shortly after she was hired in March, 1993, 
that she should give Conroy back rubs as well as "hugs and kisses." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy on several occasions draped an arm around Boyd and let his hand fall on 
her breast, the lawsuit said. In addition, Boyd walked into a Conroy 
fund-raiser in Sacramento on one occasion and was called over by the 
assemblyman, who puckered his lips and said that a kiss was one of the "perks" 
he enjoyed as a state lawmaker, Kilduff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit said other employees at the office told Boyd she should "tolerate 
and acquiesce" to the behavior. When Boyd went to discuss the problems with 
Conroy's chief of staff, Pete Conaty, she was discouraged from complaining and 
told not to talk to the assemblyman, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 When the problems persisted and Boyd refused to change her stance, Conaty told 
her she would be blackballed and see any chances for advancement ruined, the 
lawsuit alleges. Conaty is also named in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was an "intolerable" work environment, the lawsuit alleges. Boyd 
was ostracized, excluded from meetings, assigned less desirable work and had 
her hours cut, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd was fired by Conroy, but she complained to the Assembly Rules Committee, 
which oversees operation of the lower house. The committee conducted an 
investigation and agreed to transfer Boyd to a the Assembly data processing 
center. She was seated next to another female worker who had complained about 
sexual harassment by a lawmaker, Kilduff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd worked just three days before she became so emotionally distraught she 
had to leave in December, 1993, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit contends that Conroy's behavior was "intentional and malicious" 
and that Boyd was arbitrarily terminated without just cause, ruining her 
chances for a career in the state Capitol.

HIGH-STYLE DEFENSE IN HIGH-PROFILE TRIALS; COURTS: ATTORNEY JACK EARLEY SAYS HE 
WINS EMPATHY FOR CLIENTS, MANY ACCUSED OF CAPITAL CRIMES, BY MAKING THEIR 
STORIES COMPELLING TO JURORS. AT TIMES HE IS THEATRICAL, AT TIMES THE WILY 
BUMBLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the middle of a hushed courtroom, Irvine attorney Jack Earley held up a 
picture of what appeared to be the all-American family: A beaming father and 
mother with their two young daughters and two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
 With the jury looking on attentively, he suddenly raised the framed photograph 
above his head and slammed it on the lectern, shattering the glass and drawing 
gasps and looks of horror from spectators and even the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the family that Dan Broderick destroyed," Earley exclaimed, failing 
to mention that medical malpractice lawyer Daniel T. Broderick III was the dead 
victim, while Betty, his ex-wife, was the one on trial for first-degree murder 
in a case that made Court TV a staple of the nation's cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
 All in a day's work for Earley, 46, who is one of the top criminal defense 
attorneys in Orange County, his home for 16 years. He also has a long track 
record in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Diego, where onetime La Jolla 
socialite Betty Broderick was tried twice for fatally shooting her former 
husband and his new wife as they lay in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Earley's clients have included not only Broderick -- convicted of 
second-degree murder in a retrial after a hung jury the first time -- but also 
civil plaintiff Kim Springer, the Dana Point postal worker stalked by accused 
killer Mark Richard Hilbun; Janet Greene, a former teacher of the year in 
Fullerton accused of murdering her lesbian lover, and Linda Ricchio, San 
Diego's "fatal attraction" slayer who killed her ex-boyfriend but eluded the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of 48 homicide cases in a career spanning two decades, most of Earley's 
clients have been women, which is how he prefers it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone gave me a test . . . (the results) would probably come up 
'feminist,' " said Earley, who lives in Laguna Beach with his wife, Gail, and 
sons Bryan, 10, and Kyle, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever reason, colleagues say Earley works well with women, whether 
they're paying him to represent them or listening from the jury box. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has an extraordinarily fine-tuned sense for what matters in a case," said 
Elisabeth Semel, past president of California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, 
the state's criminal defense bar. "He always sees what's important, what the 
jury's going to care about. He's not the most cerebral, intellectual kind of 
lawyer, but has a way of speaking that helps jurors really understand. He's 
also very persuasive." 
</P>
<P>
 Earley's friends and even his adversaries marvel at his unorthodox style, 
which comes across as a curious mix of Mr. Magoo and Peter Falk's Columbo. 
However unconventional, it seems to work, especially with juries, who appear to 
share an Everyman's rapport with Earley. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved with his Jewish mother and Irish Catholic father from Virginia (where 
he was born) to Connecticut to Arizona, then back to Connecticut and back to 
Arizona, where he attended three different high schools before graduating in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 As a boy, he dreamed of being a writer, never a lawyer. A graduate of Cal 
State Long Beach, Earley obtained a degree from Loyola Law School in Los 
Angeles -- more, he said, out of the need to have something to do for three 
years than a desire to pursue a lifetime of arguing cases in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "At job interviews back then, everyone was wearing white shirts, skinny ties 
and black shoes, while I had long hair and wasn't about to do that ," said 
Earley, who today favors conservatively tailored suits, loafers and button-down 
shirts with print ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Semel said that despite defending numerous clients who could have received the 
death penalty, Earley has managed to keep all of them off Death Row, including 
the first person tried for capital murder after California reopened the door to 
the gas chamber in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before then that Earley's career got its start. While Earley 
was visiting friends in Riverside, a drunk driver careened into his car, 
rolling it over three times and putting him in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Laid up with no idea of what the future held in store -- he had a law degree 
but only a vague idea of the path he wanted to follow -- he took a friend's 
suggestion to work with the public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he's been a full-time lawyer without interruption, one whose cases 
are nothing if not compelling: 
</P>
<P>
 * Broderick gained the most notoriety, leading to three books and two 
made-for-television movies, in addition to gavel-to-gavel coverage on Court TV. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a trial scheduled for Sept. 20 in West Covina, Earley is representing 
Janet Greene, 51, whom Glendora police accuse of killing her former companion, 
Loretta (Ret) Coller, 62, and wounding the woman Greene considered her rival in 
a love triangle, Martha Pereida, 49. 
</P>
<P>
 Coller and Greene once taught together at Sunny Hills High School in 
Fullerton, where Greene was teacher of the year in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 * In "Until the Twelfth of Never," her book about the Broderick case, author 
Bella Stumbo describes Earley's other clients as ranging from "a frightened old 
lady who shot wildly into the darkness of her home, killing a teen-age burglar, 
to some of the most depraved examples of humanity imaginable, such as the 
rejected boyfriend who threw acid on his former girlfriend before dismembering 
her; another spurned lover who took murderous revenge not on the girlfriend but 
on her 7-year-old son instead, beating him to death; and the daughter who hired 
a couple of teen-agers to kill her aging father for his insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 The common thread running through the repertoire, Earley said, is his attempt 
to win empathy from a jury by crafting a story, much in the way a novelist 
would. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some people, doing a trial is very A-B-C-D-E," he said. "Jurors don't 
know what's important or what they should consider. So it's more like painting 
a picture or writing a book. A book should leave you with an impression. A 
picture should. A trial should." 
</P>
<P>
 Earley said he shattered the glass in the picture frame at the start of the 
Broderick trial to make a lasting impression, one that would haunt jurors for 
weeks to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to let them know there's going to be major issues they have to deal 
with. Unless they let go of the reserve, they're not going to connect to it," 
he said. "It's like the gun at the start of a race. It lets them know they're 
not going to get off easy . . . they can't just daydream through a trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, prosecutors would often have them do that, Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For D.A.'s to be successful, they want jurors to be unemotional and detached 
and very matter-of-fact. But my view is more humanistic. Life is not robotic, 
and people are not predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jurors (are) dragged kicking and screaming into courtrooms, so why would they 
want to go through an emotional, gut-wrenching decision if they can avoid it 
with a dry, matter-of-fact experience?" 
</P>
<P>
 Earley said some of his clients have been legally insane and others plainly 
guilty -- sad, sick creatures unable to function in a world without bars. But 
most, he said, are mere victims of life itself, otherwise well-meaning souls 
whose despair and desperation led them to commit the unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees many, if not most, criminal defendants as good people often led awry 
by a simple twist of fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Earley's colleagues say his talent for making a juror understand such factors 
is complemented by a Columbo-like quality of appearing confused, mixed with a 
dry sense of humor that even some of his closest friends say borders on the 
macabre. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Kerry Wells, Earley's adversary in the Broderick trials, with whom 
he often clashed in open court, suggested to jurors in closing arguments that 
his seeming incoherence was calculated to blur the horrors of his client's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say it's no act. John Cotsirilos, a fellow criminal defense attorney 
who calls Earley his best friend, said one of Earley's most riveting closing 
arguments came in a moment of panic -- after he left his notes at home, in the 
drawer by his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotsirilos said Earley's biggest achievement in the Broderick trial was 
averting a first-degree murder conviction. Broderick stole into her 
ex-husband's mansion in the pre-dawn darkness of Nov. 5, 1989, and killed him 
and his new wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick -- the younger woman he had left her 
for -- with five shots from a .38-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't have drawn a clearer map of premeditation," Cotsirilos said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ricchio "fatal attraction" trial in San Diego County, Earley used a 
yo-yo to illustrate how Ron Ruse, the former boyfriend Ricchio shot to death, 
would let her go, let her back into his life and let her ago again. 
</P>
<P>
 But Susan Fisher, the older sister of the victim, said that Earley's symbolism 
-- and much of what he argued in court -- was inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that Earley and for that matter defense attorneys in general are not 
necessarily looking for the truth," Fisher said. "Rather, they're more involved 
with trying to cast doubt on the victim's character. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's unfortunate that they're willing to sacrifice the reputation of 
the victim and the feelings of the victim's family just to try to get somebody 
off who's obviously guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the yo-yo, he implied that my brother would let her go and bring her 
back, which had nothing to do with the truth. It was a tactic, designed merely 
to affect the jury. She was stalking him. Earley managed to convince two jurors 
that she wasn't lying in wait. And now she's in prison, married to her former 
prison guard." 
</P>
<P>
 Earley is often asked how he can represent anyone who has ended another 
person's life by violence -- for whatever reason. But often, he said, the whys 
are both compelling and understandable, as is a client's need to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were a country looking at annihilation and permanent enslavement, 
wouldn't you put every resource into fighting that off?" he asked. "That's what 
a (murder) conviction means -- total enslavement for the rest of your life. 
It's a war for your life."

AUDIT URGES TIGHTER REIN ON STATE TESTS; EDUCATION: REPORT ON EMBATTLED CLAS 
EXAMS FINDS CONTRACTING ERRORS AND SOME OVERSPENDING. BUT THE PROBLEMS ARE 
RELATIVELY SMALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Department of Education should keep closer tabs on contractors doing 
work on the embattled statewide student achievement tests popularly known as 
the California Learning Assessment System, the state auditor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the auditor's report, sought by Gov. Pete Wilson at the height of a 
controversy over the tests in May, found relatively little wrong with the 
financial handling of the testing system. CLAS so far has cost $50 million to 
develop and administer. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by Auditor Kurt R. Sjoberg concluded that: 
</P>
<P>
 * In turning to a nonprofit educational research agency, Far West Laboratory, 
for help in developing the tests, the Education Department circumvented state 
civil service rules and incurred $318,000 in administrative costs. In addition, 
the department's failure to keep "adequate control" over expenses resulted in 
contractors exceeding state spending guidelines by about $14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * The department's failure to use specific, written guidelines for selecting 
test development review committees led to some imbalance in ethnic and racial 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some of the outside firms and agencies used by the department were allowed 
to begin work before the contracts were authorized, thus exposing the state to 
financial liability had the documents ultimately not been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Education Department officials disputed some of the findings, but in general 
greeted the audit as mostly a clean bill of health. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the report's "few recommendations," William D. Dawson, acting 
superintendent of public instruction, said he welcomed the scrutiny and was 
"especially pleased that the auditors recognize the exceptionally demanding 
nature" of the radically different system, which was put together quickly in 
the wake of 1991 legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rebuttal to the auditor's key criticisms, Dawson said then-Gov. George 
Deukmejian's 1990 veto of the testing system then in place, the California 
Assessment Program, decimated the department's staff and rendered it unable to 
build a new assessment system on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The committees deemed not ethnically representative of California's population 
were composed mainly of teachers, who "do not yet reflect the diversity of the 
population," Dawson said. He also disputed the auditor's findings of 
spending-limits violations, but promised to tighten contract and oversight 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's education adviser, Maureen DiMarco, who has been critical of the 
department's handling of the testing system, conceded that the report revealed 
no huge problems but said the audit represents another round in the barrage of 
criticisms of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is not insignificant that they blew almost $320,000 in 
administrative costs . . . and the fact they aren't monitoring these contracts 
is of concern," DiMarco said. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditor's report comes as testing supporters, led by state Sen. Gary K. 
Hart (D-Santa Barbara), are trying to fashion a compromise with the governor 
before the legislative session ends next week that would keep the pioneering 
but controversial testing system alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor vetoed this year's $24-million funding for the exam system, 
renamed the California Comprehensive Testing Program, in budget sessions 
earlier this summer. Wilson promised to restore the money if substantial 
changes were made in proposed legislation to renew the system for another five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's bill, SB 1273, is scheduled for a hearing before the Assembly Ways and 
Means Committee on Wednesday. The bill must be adopted before the Legislature's 
Aug. 31 adjournment and be signed by the governor or the testing system will 
expire Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the governor's demands are the inclusion of more traditional 
multiple-choice questions (along with the "performance-based" items that are 
the tests' hallmarks) and the addition of more diverse members to boards that 
review tests' contents before they are administered. 
</P>
<P>
 The exams were designed to spur educational reform in California by 
determining how well the state's public school students understand math 
concepts and can think and write about what they have read. But the process has 
been plagued by scoring glitches and faced concerted attacks by religious 
conservatives about the literary selections and questions on the reading and 
writing portions of the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were given for the first time last year to about 1 million students 
in the fourth, eighth and 10th grades. To save money, only some of the exams 
were graded. Scoring is now under way for the second round of tests given this 
year, which included fifth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, a report by a panel of statistical experts that probed 
scoring and test development difficulties blamed the problems in part on the 
pressure the Education Department was under to produce the new system in a 
short time and with limited funds. The panel found that the system could be 
fixed, however, and urged that it be continued.

BID TO RAISE CIGARETTE TAX TO TREAT PROSTATE CANCER DEFEATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A bill increasing the state cigarette tax by two cents a pack to raise $37 
million annually for prostrate cancer research and treatment was rejected 
Monday by the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was defeated on a 49-26 vote, five short of the two-thirds majority 
of 54 votes needed for passage. Its sponsor, Assemblyman Stan Statham (R-Oak 
Run), said he will seek reconsideration at a later date. There was no debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature last year approved, and Gov. Pete Wilson signed into law, a 
bill increasing the cigarette tax by two cents a package to raise funds for 
breast cancer research and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 But 1994 is an election year and lower house Republican lawmakers appeared 
reluctant to approve a tax increase. Forty-five Democrats and five Republicans 
voted for the bill. All votes against it were lodged by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Statham's bill, the state cigarette tax would have climbed to 39 cents a 
pack. A pack of cigarettes sells for about $2.00. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the tax hike would have gone for prostate cancer research and half for 
treatment. This year, the state is to receive $51 million from the federal 
government for prostate cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening remarks, Statham told his colleagues: "Gentlemen, you have a 
chance to save your own life. Women live in fear of breast cancer. Men should 
live in fear of prostate cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that there is growing medical evidence showing a possible link 
between smoking and prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in California, and is 
the second-highest killer of men in the state behind lung cancer, Statham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease increased 58.9% in California during the three-year period between 
1988-1991, according to the American Cancer Society. In 1991, it exceeded 
breast cancer for the first time as the most frequent type of cancer in 
California.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; POLICE, BOSSES SPLIT OVER ENDORSEMENTS; BROWN 
WINS BACKING OF RANK-AND-FILE OFFICERS. WILSON GAINS SUPPORT OF POLICE CHIEFS 
AND SHERIFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a case of dueling endorsements, the state's largest group of cops on the 
beat backed Democrat Kathleen Brown for governor Monday, one day after their 
bosses -- police chiefs and sheriffs -- threw their support to Republican Gov. 
Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Peace Officers Research Assn. of California, which endorsed Wilson four 
years ago and opposed Brown in the Democratic primary, switched to Brown for 
the general election in part because she promised to give rank-and-file 
officers a formal voice in her judicial appointments process, said Skip Murphy, 
the labor group's president. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sacramento County Sheriff Glen Craig, speaking for the California Peace 
Officers Assn., said Wilson has a long and solid record of fighting for 
improved law enforcement and deserves another four years as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle for the police endorsements -- always an intense part of any 
governor's race -- has taken on new dimensions this year because crime is atop 
the list of voters' concerns, according to public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Police groups can raise significant sums of campaign money and, perhaps more 
important, their seal of approval gives credibility to the claim that every 
candidate makes: that they are the best choice for voters interested in public 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The endorsement from PORAC -- which represents 39,000 California law 
enforcement officers -- was something of a coup for Brown, whose scant record 
on criminal justice issues and personal opposition to the death penalty have 
left her open to Wilson's charge that she would be a weak leader in the fight 
against crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing those concerns, the police labor group backed Insurance Commissioner 
John Garamendi over Brown in the Democratic primary this year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Murphy said Brown seemed to be telling the group's board members 
"what she thought we wanted to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown turned that sentiment around with a dogged lobbying effort in which 
she pursued the endorsement in meetings with the local police union leaders who 
sit on the association's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Past candidates are past candidates and past races are past races," Murphy 
said. "Today we're dealing with two people and we weighed those two people. 
Today we are convinced that for California's rank-and-file law enforcement 
officers, that Kathleen Brown is the absolute best candidate for that 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said: "Police officers and deputy sheriffs are convinced that Kathleen 
Brown will enforce the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig said Murphy's group was more interested in bread-and-butter issues than 
law enforcement. He said the Peace Officers Assn., which represents management, 
is a better gauge of the law enforcement community's view of the candidates.

RESIDENTS SET TO FLEE AS FIRE PERILS HOMES IN NORTHWESTERN MONTANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of about 30 homes near this resort community packed up belongings 
Monday in anticipation of fleeing a wildfire that was about two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of the area, which is called Star Meadows, began removing pets 
and belongings, but few left themselves, said Chuck Rhodes, a former sheriff 
who is coordinating activities with the Flathead and North Valley search and 
rescue associations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're feeling rather rushed," said Carol Hansen, who said she couldn't see 
the fire from her house as she packed. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Little Wolf fire is one of more than 150 in northwestern Montana 
that together have burned about 45,000 acres. The Little Wolf fire, the state's 
largest, grew by 2,000 acres overnight into a 14,000-acre blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a 3,000-acre blaze was encroaching on 37 homes west of Libby, and a 
Red Cross shelter was prepared there for possible evacuees. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Little Wolf fire burns toward the homes in Star Meadows, some may be 
hard to save because they are in small clearings in the forest, said Flathead 
National Forest Supervisor Joel Holtrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 1,400 firefighters and support crews were battling the fire. In 
addition, there were 25 fire engines, 17 bulldozers, three helicopters and 22 
water trucks.

TRAGIC WILDFIRE PROMPTS NEW SAFETY RULES; DISASTER: U.S. OFFICIALS RECOMMEND 
CHANGES AFTER A REPORT ON A COLORADO BLAZE THAT KILLED 14 FIREFIGHTERS SAID 
MISTAKES LED TO THEIR DEATHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Federal authorities on Monday recommended sweeping revisions in the way 
wildfires are fought after reviewing a series of blunders that contributed to 
the deaths of 14 firefighters in a western Colorado blaze last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations will go into effect within 45 days and could improve 
safety and minimize risk to firefighters battling dozens of blazes roaring out 
of control across the West, Bureau of Land Management Director Mike Dombeck 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are painfully learning that mistakes were made" during the July 6 fire on 
Storm King Mountain near Glenwood Springs, Dombeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Breakdowns in communication. Errors in judgment. Lack of coordination. The 
same sort of mistakes people make every day," Dombeck said. "Only this time, 
the fuel and weather and flame magnified them, an error with deadly and tragic 
consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 The news conference coincided with the release of a report Monday on 
Colorado's deadliest wildfire prepared by a joint U.S. Forest Service and 
Bureau of Land Management investigative team. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said fire supervisors failed to set up adequate escape routes and 
safety zones at the scene despite extreme fire danger because of a year of 
drought, low humidity and record temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 It also cited a lack of communication among firefighting organizations 
handling the blaze, which resulted in confusion about priority-setting and 
availability of resources -- including smoke jumpers and retardant-carrying 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the report said, problems were complicated by a "can-do" attitude 
on the part of both supervisors and interagency "hotshot" firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, "firefighting fundamentals were compromised during a period of 
extreme weather and fire behavior in a highly flammable fuel type," the report 
said. "This situation, compounded by failure to provide critical fire weather 
and fire behavior information to the firefighters, was the primary cause of the 
injuries and deaths." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was sparked July 2 by lightning in a grove of trees and burned slowly 
until it was fanned by dry winds gusting to more than 45 m.p.h. in rough 
terrain near Glenwood Springs, about 180 miles west of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 By July 6, a total 49 firefighters had been dispatched to the steep 
7,000-foot-high ridges of Storm King Mountain. A helicopter was used for 
water-drops, and other aircraft dropped fire retardant. 
</P>
<P>
 That afternoon, slurry bombers were sent away from the fire because powerful, 
swirling winds at the head of a cold front posed a danger to pilots. The fire 
suddenly erupted, galloping around a corner and overwhelming the firefighters 
as they struggled up a steep ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14 victims died at the center of the blaze without making it into their 
fiberglass and aluminum emergency shelters. They perished within seconds of 
smoke inhalation amid heat so intense that it disintegrated some of the 
shields, Garfield County Coroner Trey Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigative team called for a management review of how all federal, 
state and local firefighting organizations plan and conduct operations to 
respond to fires from season to season. 
</P>
<P>
 It also requested a federal review of the National Weather Service's red flag 
program, which issues warnings when conditions are imminent or occurring that 
are of importance to fire behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, fire supervisors at Glenwood Springs found it hard to 
distinguish between red flags for cold fronts and high winds and those for 
lightning. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gary Bennett, a fire weather meteorologist for the National Weather 
Service, countered that "if they (fire managers) don't know the difference 
(between various red flag conditions) they should not be out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The team also recommended developing new guidelines for the use of the 
heat-repulsing emergency shelters, and training on how to locate ideal 
deployment sites and safety zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is conducting a separate 
investigation -- an effort that some believe will prevent accusations of a 
whitewash by the Forest Service and BLM, which essentially investigated their 
own agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some relatives of those who died in the fire responded to the findings in the 
report with strong emotions -- and tears. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles outside of Burns, Ore., the United States and Colorado flags that 
once covered 22-year-old firefighter Levi Brinkley's coffin waved at half staff 
in the front yard of his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinkley's brother, Josh, 23, took the day off from fighting forest fires to 
read the report on the inferno that killed his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "It upsets me that they are trying to blame 14 dead people," he said. "It 
wasn't their attitude that killed them. They were there because they were told 
to be." 
</P>

GOP IS PRIMED FOR AMENDING CRIME MEASURE; SENATE: REPUBLICANS SAY SPENDING CUTS 
OF $3.3 BILLION MADE BY THE HOUSE AREN'T ENOUGH. THEY WILL TRY TO BLOCK 
CONSIDERATION OF THE BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A day after the House resuscitated a compromise $30-billion crime bill, the 
legislation began an equally dangerous journey Monday in the Senate, where 
Republicans warned that they will attempt a procedural maneuver to force major 
revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as anything I have ever voted on in 22 years as a United States 
senator, I believe passage of this legislation will make a difference in the 
lives of the American people," Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. 
Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said as debate on President Clinton's bill began in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Republican critics said that, even after the $3.3 billion in spending 
cuts that were forced in the House, the measure remains an exercise in liberal 
excess that will have little effect on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "A vote for this bill is a vote to spend literally billions of dollars in 
1960s-style social spending boondoggles," insisted Sen. Orrin G. Hatch 
(R-Utah), the Judiciary Committee's ranking Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch ridiculed as "poppycock" the centerpiece of the legislation -- its claim 
that spending $8.8 billion would allow the hiring of 100,000 more officers for 
community policing. He said that the number would be 20,000 at most and that 
only a fraction of those actually would be on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure's other provisions include the much-touted "three strikes" feature 
that would put third-time violent and drug felons in prison for life. But that 
would only apply to the relatively small number whose third convictions were in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill is vulnerable to the procedural move under an arcane Senate rule, 
known as a "point of order," because its chief funding mechanism is a trust 
fund that was not approved by the Senate Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 If the move succeeds, the bill then could be thrown open to amendment. 
However, Republican opponents must muster 41 votes to prevail and it is unclear 
whether they can do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Any changes again could jeopardize passage in the House -- particularly if 
opponents of a ban on assault-style weapons use the procedural move to strip 
the bill of that provision. At a minimum, it would probably delay final passage 
until after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) warned that it would be "unwise 
both substantively and politically for anyone to try to obstruct passage of 
this bill." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans insisted that they are not trying to kill a bill that would be 
the first major piece of crime legislation in six years. Rather, they said, 
they want to improve it. They said they would strip out what they considered 
unnecessary spending that would not contribute to reducing crime and would add 
harsher penalties for some types of offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether he is fearful of the political consequences to his party of 
being labeled obstructionist, Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) replied: "Not since 
Br'er Rabbit and the briar patch has anybody been as comfortable as we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Procedural moves can be just as devastating as outright defeats, but they also 
allow lawmakers to have more flexibility -- and to avoid more blame -- then 
with a straight up or down vote. 
</P>
<P>
 It was on a procedural vote that the House initially blocked consideration of 
the crime bill almost two weeks ago, before renegotiating the package and 
passing it, 235 to 195, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The divisions in the Senate are not entirely along party lines. Sen. Arlen 
Specter (R-Pa.), for instance, said that although he does not consider it 
perfect, he would support the bill because "it spends a lot of money for a 
very, very important cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Larry E. Craig (R-Ida.) said that opponents are counting on the votes of 
at least three Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration stepped up pressure Monday for the bill -- a 
victory it badly needs, in no small part to create some momentum for its 
endangered health care effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton met privately with several senators and White House Chief of Staff 
Leon E. Panetta made the rounds of morning news shows, saying that opponents 
would be "a disgrace to the country" if they block the bill.

$5-MILLION LOTTERY WINNER OKS ALIMONY, CHILD SUPPORT DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who walked out on his wife and three children 48 years ago agreed Monday 
to pay them less than $100,000 in child support and alimony from the 
$5.1-million lottery jackpot he won in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Hines, 73, of Newport, filed a claim in Family Court seeking retroactive 
child support and unspecified alimony after learning from a newspaper 
photograph that her ex-husband had won the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
 She and John Gonsalves, 71, of North Dartmouth, Mass., reached a settlement 
just before the case was to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of the settlement, a lump sum, was not disclosed. However, 
Gonsalves, a retired janitor who receives $170,000 a year from the 
Massachusetts Lottery Commission for 20 years, said it was significantly less 
than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonsalves had moved out of the home he shared with Hines and their children, 
then ages 2, 4, and 6, in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he caught her with another man; she said she was never unfaithful. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonsalves lived nearby in southeastern Massachusetts and saw Hines 
occasionally. He said he looked after their children some summers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hines said life was hard after her husband left. She went on welfare and 
worked two jobs; as a $7-a-week housecleaner and at a naval base cafeteria.

MILITARY; PENTAGON'S 'BOTTOM-UP REVIEW' APPEARS TO BE DOWN AND OUT; A YEAR 
AFTER DEFENSE CHIEF ASPIN PRAISED HIS POST-COLD WAR REDESIGN, IT HAS BECOME A 
LIABILITY. NOW SOME CRITICS ARE ASKING FOR A REVIEW OF THE REVIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barely a year after it was unveiled, the Pentagon's highly touted "bottom-up 
review" of U.S. defense policy -- intended to serve as the Clinton 
Administration's blueprint for the post-Cold War military -- is largely in 
tatters. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned by former Defense Secretary Les Aspin, the review was supposed 
to clean out old Cold War thinking, forge a new role for the military and yield 
a smaller but tougher fighting force. Aspin claimed that it did exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has produced a lean, mobile, high-tech force, ready to protect Americans 
in this new time," he told reporters proudly last September, when the new study 
was completed. "It . . . is based upon the real dangers that face America in 
the new era." 
</P>
<P>
 But today, the bottom-up review has become a liability, derided by outside 
defense experts of all stripes and given only a lukewarm embrace by the 
Department of Defense's new management. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberals complain that the review's central recommendation -- that the United 
States maintain a large enough force to fight two major regional wars "nearly 
simultaneously" -- is merely a holdover from Cold War days and is out of sync 
with the relatively low-intensity conflicts that have broken out in Rwanda, 
Haiti and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives charge that the Administration's defense budget is nowhere near 
sufficient to finance the force that the review says would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 And to top it off, Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who moved up from 
deputy secretary after Aspin resigned in December, conceded recently that the 
military would not be able to meet the goal of fighting two major regional wars 
at once for several more years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom-up review stated fairly clearly . . . that the ability to meet the 
two-war contingency hinged on some force enhancements being made," Perry told 
the Navy Times in an interview last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But he warned that modernizing forces -- by outfitting warplanes with 
precision-guided bombs and missiles, for example -- is "going to take a few 
years. To have those force enhancements then capable of fighting two full-scale 
major regional contingencies is a couple of years ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Dov Zakheim of Systems Planning Corp., a defense-oriented technology and 
strategy company, said that the Administration is clearly "torn" over the 
bottom-up review. "They recognize they don't have the resources to support it, 
but they have no alternative. They're caught between a strategic rock and a 
fiscal hard place." 
</P>
<P>
 With budget pressures already intense, the Administration is finding itself in 
the ironic position of having to use the bottom-up review -- which initially 
was designed to help justify further cuts in military spending -- to protect 
the current defense budget level instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department officials now cite the review to warn would-be 
budget-raiders in Congress that, if they cut the military budget any more than 
Clinton already has proposed, the ability of the military to meet the new goals 
will be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, such outside critics as Andrew F. Krepinevich, director of the 
Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan defense-monitoring group, are calling on 
Perry to review the review, with an eye toward scrapping it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although defense officials insisted that Perry still fully supports the 
review's conclusions, insiders say John M. Deutch, the deputy secretary of 
defense, is quietly giving the document a second look and may end up rewriting 
it entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in a preliminary memo made public on Monday, officials warned that 
budget pressures could well force the Administration to cancel some of the 
military's most pressing big-ticket future weapon programs, including the F-22 
jet fighter and the Army's Commanche helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not certain yet how many of these programs ultimately will be cut, but 
the military already has begun to complain about the prospect of the 
reductions. Strategists say the services already are being stretched to carry 
out their current missions. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the most serious criticism of the bottom-up review is that it has not 
produced recommendations for the kinds of sweeping post-Cold War changes in 
U.S. military policy that Aspin appeared to have in mind when he proposed it 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the demise of the Soviet Union, analysts said, the review would leave 
military policy essentially unchanged from the days of the George Bush 
Administration. It calls for only marginal reductions in troop strength and 
almost no major cuts in weapon systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst David Isenberg of the Cato Institute, a libertarian research 
organization, contended that the review's scenario of two major regional wars 
is a throwback to the Cold War, when the Pentagon was concerned about fighting 
2 1/2 full-scale wars in Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 And many analysts, such as Systems Planning Corp.'s Zakheim, questioned 
Aspin's use of the 1991 Persian Gulf War as the standard for figuring future 
U.S. military requirements. The situation that U.S. troops faced there is 
likely to prove unique, Zakheim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he warned, the United States is far more likely to encounter a series 
of simultaneous low-level conflicts such as today's in Haiti and Rwanda. The 
force structure required for those is likely to be "entirely different," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives warned that even if the two-war scenario is valid, Clinton's 
current defense budget falls far short of what is needed to finance the force 
structure demanded by the review and will stretch existing troops and equipment 
paper-thin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a former fighter pilot, predicted that the Aspin 
plan risks a return to the "hollow forces" of the 1970s, when the military was 
so depleted that it would have been unable to mount a serious offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army already is having to cut modernization and some maintenance and 
training activities. And the operating tempo of some units -- the amount of 
time that they actually spend on operations, as opposed to being down for 
maintenance or replenishment -- is down. 
</P>
<P>
 On procedural grounds, the authors of the bottom-up review are criticized for 
crafting it to fit within the budget limits that Clinton already had set, 
rather than setting military policy first and then shaping the budget to 
reflect it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that the budget is what was driving this," said Don M. 
Snider, director of political-military affairs for the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies, a middle-of-the-road Washington think-tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Perry's continued support of the review in public, many senior 
military officers are highly critical of the document. The Army, the service 
that was hardest-hit by the cuts, has launched a full-scale attack in Congress, 
quietly urging members of the House and Senate Armed Services committees to 
oppose the reductions in spending on force modernization. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no real consensus on what ultimately will happen to the bottom-up 
review. Some insiders predict that it may be allowed to fade away after 
Congress passes the fiscal 1996 budget about a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, Clinton appears to be stuck with the bottom-up review, for 
appearances' sake if nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that the Administration would look even more awkward if it 
abandons the document so soon after its unveiling. And Pentagon-watchers said 
that the White House now needs the review to help defend its military programs 
from would-be budget-cutters in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton warned lawmakers in January that he planned to hold the line on the 
defense reductions that he had proposed. To do so, Administration lobbyists 
have been warning that any further cuts would jeopardize the goals set in the 
bottom-up review. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the moment," Zakheim said, "there's nothing to replace it."

 Seven Indian soldiers were killed in an ambush in a village controlled by 
warlord Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, officials said in the capital, Mogadishu. 
Nine other Indians, also in Somalia as peacekeepers for the United Nations, 
were wounded in the convoy ambush 70 miles southwest of the capital. Attacks on 
U.N. troops have been increasing. U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
is recommending reducing the peacekeeping operation because of lack of progress 
toward a settlement by warring militias.

RUSSIA, GERMANY PLEDGE TO BATTLE NUCLEAR SMUGGLING; EUROPE: OFFICIALS FAIL TO 
DETERMINE ORIGINS OF SEIZED PLUTONIUM. THEY URGE GLOBAL INFORMATION-SHARING ON 
ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the wake of last week's plutonium scare, Russia and Germany agreed Monday 
to boost their joint efforts to prevent nuclear smuggling, but they failed to 
determine whether the atomic contraband captured in Munich actually originated 
in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrapping up three days of talks in Moscow, Bernd Schmidbauer, the German 
intelligence coordinator, and his Russian counterparts issued a determinedly 
neutral statement concluding that they must all fight harder against the 
nuclear black market "regardless of its origins." 
</P>
<P>
 German officials have said the 10.5-ounce cache of purloined plutonium-239, 
nabbed in Munich on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow two weeks ago, probably came 
from Russia. But Moscow has strenuously denied it could have been produced 
here, and Sergei Stepashin, Russia's counterintelligence chief, told reporters 
Monday that its point of origin remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 The plutonium incident, the fourth lot of nuclear contraband to surface in 
Germany in four months, reignited global fears that chaos and corruption in the 
former Soviet Union could spawn a plentiful supply of illicit uranium and 
plutonium that could end up in the hands of terrorists or a hostile 
dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 According to reports from Bonn, the Russian-German agreement calls for greater 
intelligence swaps between the two countries on illegal nuclear materials and 
tougher control at the borders. It also proposes an international clearinghouse 
for information on nuclear smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no bad without good," Stepashin said. "This latest case has 
stimulated both agencies to move to concrete, operative work." 
</P>
<P>
 Aware that confrontation would only make matters worse, both sides made a 
point of the cordial atmosphere of Schmidbauer's talks. But the friendliness 
appeared strained. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's finance minister had said in remarks published over the weekend that 
continued economic aid -- Germany is Russia's largest donor -- would depend on 
Russian efforts to stem nuclear smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Russian nuclear officials concentrated on proving that the 
plutonium could not have originated in their plants or laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Kurchatov Atomic Energy Institute in Moscow, Russia's premier nuclear 
science center, the director for external affairs said an extensive check of 
supplies is under way. But, so far, the nuclear materials there "have not 
decreased by even a gram." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian television showed the extensive security precautions taken at the 
institute, including a special gate that checks for traces of nuclear 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past, Russian officials have acknowledged that theft of atomic 
material is likely given the low salaries of most nuclear workers and the messy 
state of Russia's new borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Plutonium is dangerous not only because it is a key ingredient of nuclear 
bombs but because it is so extremely toxic that even the tiniest grain can 
cause cancer. Security officials' nightmares range from the prospect that 
states like Libya and Iraq could get an atomic bomb to the possibility that 
terrorists could poison a whole city's water supply with a few pounds of 
plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidbauer did not provide his Russian hosts with samples of the plutonium 
seized in Munich; he gave them only European scientists' reports on its 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russian experts continued to insist it did not appear to have been made 
here and that its quality indicates it came from a Western reactor. Some 
Russian officials believe the plutonium affair has been cooked up to justify 
the imposition of international control on Russia's nuclear plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepashin and Schmidbauer tried to take the emphasis off finger-pointing and 
said they devoted far more discussion to planning joint action. They accused 
the media of trying to depict a confrontation where one never existed.

DIANA DENIES MAKING NUISANCE CALLS TO ART DEALER FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A distraught Princess Diana has denied making anonymous telephone calls to an 
art dealer friend who was acting as a go-between when her marriage to Prince 
Charles fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest bizarre twist in the life of the estranged wife of Prince 
Charles, the heir to the British throne.Diana, 33, bowed out of public life 
last year after she made a heartfelt plea for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 But she propelled herself back into the limelight with an unprecedented 
interview published Monday in the tabloid Daily Mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Media reports say Oliver Hoare, a close friend of Diana and Charles, 
complained to police last October about a stream of nuisance calls. Each time 
he answered, no one spoke at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoare, an expert on Islamic art, worried that he might be the target of Middle 
East extremists, but investigators were said to have traced the calls to 
Diana's private apartments, her mobile phone, a line at her sister's house and 
even some public phone booths. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana, denying she ever made any of the calls, told the tabloid: "You cannot 
be serious. I don't even know how to use a parking meter, let alone a phone 
box."

PASSIONS UNLEASHED AMONG O.C. LATINOS OVER WATERSHED VOTE; REACTION: RULING 
PARTY CANDIDATE'S VICTORY ATTRACTS ATTENTION OF ACTIVISTS AND ORDINARY FOLK 
ALIKE. SOME DECRY POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE, OTHERS APPLAUD BALLOTING.

<P>
 Reaction was mixed among Orange County's Latinos a day after the presidential 
election victory of Ernesto Zedillo, head of Mexico's ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up early today expecting to see headlines reading that the Panista 
candidate (Diego Fernandez de Cevallos) would win," said construction worker 
Miguel Angel Luna Arrellano of San Juan Capistrano. "Instead, it was just 
another PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Luna said he believes that Mexico immediately will face potential violence in 
areas such as the Mexican state of Chiapas, the scene of a New Year's Day 
rebellion by guerrillas of the Zapatista National Liberation Army on what they 
said was the behalf of the Mayan masses. The uprising left 145 people dead and 
radically shifted a national political agenda just months before Sunday's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sentiments and my heart are for the campesinos in Chiapas," Luna said. 
"Really, I think the real question is, how are they reacting to this? I think 
that if Fernandez had won, he would have supported the working people in Mexico 
and you would have seen Mexicans workers from here in the United States return 
and work in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County and elsewhere in California, there was ample evidence Monday 
of the passions unleashed Sunday by Mexico's watershed national elections. The 
balloting was the most scrutinized, and possibly the most competitive, in 
Mexico's history. Zedillo of the PRI emerged victorious Monday, extending his 
party's 65-year hold on presidential power. 
</P>
<P>
 Amin David, president of Los Amigos de Anaheim, was encouraged by Sunday's 
election, saying he believed it was one of the "fairest ever held. I was glad 
that finally we were going to get a true sense of what the will of the people 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for the new leader will be how Zedillo handles Chiapas and that 
state's reaction to his victory, said Alma Buis, Fullerton police liaison to 
the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born in Mexico City," Buis said. "And I remember how PRI controls 
elections and the government." 
</P>
<P>
 "To understand how PRI works," Luna said, "you need to live in Mexico, like my 
brother, for instance. He lives with his wife in Sonora. She has been a major 
supporter of PRI for 15 years, and during that period she has won government 
contracts for work. . . . They control everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Soto, 36, a construction worker from San Juan Capistrano, said he had 
placed his hopes with Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's initial 
presidential candidate who was shot to death during a visit to Tijuana on March 
23. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that Colosio would have been a good president," Soto said. "He had 
promised to make a lot of changes and wanted to include -- and not keep out -- 
people from Chiapas. The Mexican people, I feel, were ready to accept a change, 
and he would have been good for the country." 
</P>
<P>
 At Josie's shop, a hair and nails salon in San Juan Capistrano, Guillermina 
Aragon, 26, listened as a radio announcer said that Fernandez had taken 31% of 
the votes, to Zedillo's 47%. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, it was close," said Aragon, who is from Cuernavaca, Mexico. "My family 
always voted PRI," but she always voted for PAN, Fernandez's conservative 
National Action Party. "It seems that PRI was always looking out for the upper 
class, and PAN supported the worker." 
</P>
<P>
 Aragon's friend, Reina Delgado, 24, said she was happy that so many people 
voted. After so many years of one party's rule, many Mexican people had 
accepted a "so what" view to voting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many ask, why vote?" Delgado said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Mexican political leaders have made strong overtures to 
Mexican nationals residing in the United States, whose remittances back home 
and other expenditures in Mexico are a crucial source of foreign currency. And 
the North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect in January, has 
served to strengthen cross-border ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Montez, head of Santa Ana's League of United Latin American Citizens, was 
satisfied with Zedillo's victory, saying that LULAC is looking forward to 
working with the president again. It turns out that LULAC established a program 
using Mexico's Spanish books through Zedillo, then education secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tend to look at the border areas and Mexico's urban centers, like in the 
capital, as signs of progress," Montez said. "We should go back to measuring 
democracy, not by economy, but by the quality of life that everyone enjoys." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the greatest challenge this presidency is going to face," Montez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montez said Zedillo will be extended an invitation to visit Santa Ana through 
the Mexican consul's office there.

DECISION IN MEXICO; RULING PARTY CANDIDATES LEAD IN CONGRESSIONAL RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 As all eyes were focused Monday on the declaration of victory by Mexico's 
ruling party in the hotly contested presidential election, the Federal 
Electoral Institute's computers quietly -- and slowly -- were turning out 
another set of numbers that analysts said would bring about fundamental changes 
in this nation's traditional, rubber-stamp Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 With 500 seats at stake in Mexico's Chamber of Deputies and 96 of 128 seats in 
the Senate up for grabs in Sunday's vote, counting of the tens of millions of 
legislative ballots cast during the record turnout was running far behind the 
presidential tallies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) was leading by margins 
roughly equal to those in the presidential contest in congressional races in 
all but two of Mexico's 31 states and the Federal District of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 With about 40% of the legislative vote tallied Monday night, ruling party 
candidates were ahead of their closest rivals from the opposition National 
Action Party (PAN) and the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) by an average 
of 20 percentage points in every state -- except in Nuevo Leon and Jalisco. In 
those two states, the PAN was ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the numbers, analysts warned, may be misleading when it comes to the shape 
of Congress, where a complex formula of proportional representation still could 
prevent the PRI from winning its traditionally huge congressional majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts and ruling party strategists added that, even if the PRI 
does win an outright majority in the Chamber and Senate, it cannot win its 
traditional two-thirds majority in the Chamber; the party would need that 
voting power there to change the national constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is going to have to be a lot of political work in the house (Chamber) 
to build coalitions and consensus, if we are going to pass major legislation," 
said one key PRI analyst. "It's going to be a very lively Congress. We're going 
to see a new trend toward the balance of powers." 
</P>
<P>
 But underlying Monday's tallies, there were several clear setbacks for the 
opposition -- especially for Diego Fernandez de Cevallos' PAN. Most experts, 
analyzing Monday's trends, said the indications were that few voters split 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Baja California was a graphic case in point. PAN has ruled the state for five 
years, since the party won its first governorship there in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But all three of the party's candidates for the Chamber were trailing PRI 
rivals in legislative contests there Monday night. Further, PAN appeared in 
danger of losing a Senate seat there, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the PRI's strong showing in Baja resulted partly from 
predictable voter disillusionment with incumbents in a state plagued by 
underdevelopment and drug-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Ganster, of San Diego State University -- a Mexico analyst who served as 
an election observer in Tijuana -- said PAN was disadvantaged by pro-ruling 
party media and the hometown pull of PRI presidential candidate Ernesto 
Zedillo; he grew up in Mexicali. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ganster said he was convinced it was unlikely that the governing party 
would win an absolute majority in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will be very healthy for the country," he said. "It's clear that to 
govern nationally, the PRI is going to have to have the participation of the 
PAN and other parties." 
</P>

DECISION IN MEXICO; WINNER INHERITS THORNY COLOSIO CASE; PROBE: FOR MANY, THE 
MUDDLED INVESTIGATION OF THE MARCH ASSASSINATION SYMBOLIZES PROFOUND DOUBTS 
ABOUT RULE OF LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Ernesto Zedillo claims victory in Mexico's presidential election, he moves 
toward a challenge that could prove the ultimate test of his promises for 
change: the Colosio case. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mexico's next president will enter a dramatically altered political 
landscape bristling with difficult tasks, perhaps none is as politically and 
personally delicate as the unresolved assassination of ruling party candidate 
Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's killing at a Tijuana campaign rally in March catapulted Zedillo, the 
slain candidate's campaign manager, from technocratic obscurity to the pinnacle 
of power. 
</P>
<P>
 With the election race in full swing in July, angry Mexicans rejected the 
government's conclusion that the alleged killer, Mario Aburto Martinez, acted 
alone. A new special prosecutor was appointed to probe allegations of a 
conspiracy, notably the increasing accusations of a plot involving hard-line 
leaders of Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and powerful drug 
cartels. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo inherits both a muddled investigation and a weary citizenry left 
cynical by generalized lawlessness and a string of unsolved murders linked to 
drug corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Mexicans -- according to Mexican officials, journalists, human rights 
activists and other analysts -- the Colosio case has come to symbolize profound 
doubts about the rule of law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is whether the Mexican judiciary system works," said Jorge 
Mancillas, a UCLA professor and adviser to the alleged gunman's family, which 
accuses the government of involvement in a plot. "The Colosio case is a litmus 
test of whether any of the major political parties understand the issue or just 
inherit a system of government based on patronage and corruption." 
</P>
<P>
 Many conspiracy theorists share Mancillas' fear that the crime will simply 
fade into memory and myth, becoming Mexico's version of the assassination of 
President John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zedillo isn't going to do anything," scoffed a young official in Baja 
California, a state run by the opposition National Action Party. "He has too 
many debts and connections. The main suspects are the 'dinosaurs' (old-guard 
politicians), who are very powerful in his own party." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another school of thought: that either Zedillo or lame-duck 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who will rule until December, could make 
the case top priority in a bold, risky attempt to demonstrate true reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling how Salinas sought to legitimize his questionable victory in 1988 
with attacks on high-level corruption, one analyst said Zedillo would benefit 
from an aggressive investigation of the Colosio case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the intellectual authors turn out to be people close to the system, 
this could become a strategy to purge the PRI and symbolize a new era," said 
Tonatiuh Lopez Guillen, a political scientist at the College of the Northern 
Border in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 The assassination was not a prominent theme in Zedillo's campaign. But he 
declared on several occasions that he and his party wanted justice done. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, the law enforcement and political obstacles remain formidable. 
Critics say that former special prosecutor Miguel Montes Garcia came up with 
thin evidence, neglected potential leads and lurched from a conspiracy theory 
-- he filed charges against five alleged plotters -- back to the lone gunman 
scenario. The result: confusion and suspicion among the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the trail has grown cold after five months. It seems more difficult 
than ever to establish whether Aburto's mysterious conduct and self-proclaimed 
political connections were indicative of a plot or of a deluded lone assassin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Resolving the case necessitates reconstructing the chain of events," said 
Gerardo Albarran de Alba, a political reporter for Proceso, a respected 
national weekly. "That will be difficult. . . . Even if the opposition won, it 
would be difficult to break the blockage of information within the police 
apparatus, to totally renovate the judicial system." 
</P>
<P>
 The main development recently has been the emergence of a potential new 
witness, Eduardo Valle Espinosa, a former top aide in the attorney general's 
office who headed an elite unit investigating powerful drug lords. A colorful, 
tough-talking former student leader and journalist known as "The Owl," Valle 
quit his post in May and denounced the corruption that he says has turned 
Mexico into a "narco-democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Valle has offered to testify about his suspicions that the 
assassination was related to infiltration of the Colosio campaign by 
drug-trafficking interests; he has also implicated two former police commanders 
who worked as Colosio aides, and named top government officials with alleged 
drug ties as well. Valle told journalists that he tried to warn Colosio of the 
dangers shortly before the candidate's death. Valle has moved to Washington for 
his safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are preparing to take his testimony at an as-yet undesignated 
Mexican consulate in the United States, spokesman Miguel Angel Sanchez de Armas 
said Monday. Since the appointment in July of special prosecutor Olga Islas de 
Gonzalez Mariscal, authorities have taken 64 statements from previous witnesses 
and new ones, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has emerged that has enough relevance to change the direction of the 
initial investigation," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Valle's allegations remain uncorroborated, his statements, coming 
from a knowledgeable former law enforcement official, add credibility to 
assertions that Colosio fell victim to the fearsome mix of drugs and politics; 
and a high-ranking official of the Baja state government said in an interview 
that, before the assassination, he learned that men with purported criminal 
connections were part of the Colosio campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very surprised to see the kind of people who were around Colosio," said 
the Baja official, who suspects a conspiracy involving some of the most 
powerful politicians in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But pursuing the "narco-politics" thesis would pose considerable danger if the 
case remains open when Zedillo takes office. It could bring him into conflict 
with PRI "dinosaurs," who were instrumental in his apparent victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts question whether the president would have the strength or desire for 
this clash amid the multiple challenges of resolving the conflict with Indian 
rebels in Chiapas, negotiating with powerful opposition parties and putting 
together a viable government. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, although Salinas' image would benefit from an investigative 
bombshell before he steps down, he may not have the power to strike such a 
blow. "It's hard to foresee serious progress coming from an initiative led by 
the present government before Dec. 1," when it goes out of power, Mancillas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Zedillo could end up ordering investigators to determine conclusively 
whether or not Aburto acted alone, then trying to persuade the Mexican people 
of the correctness of the outcome. At stake would be the credibility of the 
justice system as well as who killed Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, Zedillo like no one else will feel pressure to resolve the case 
with the truth," said Albarran of Proceso. He added that, if the narco-politics 
thesis is valid, "Zedillo is doubly obligated -- because the next president 
will have to fight drug trafficking to the point that is politically and 
humanly possible in order to heal the democratic life of this country."

DECISION IN MEXICO; RESULTS DRAW RANGE OF RESPONSES IN U.S.; REACTION: COMMENTS 
FROM CLINTON ADMINISTRATION ARE CAUTIOUS. EXPATRIATES ARE PASSIONATELY DIVIDED.

<P>
 Although the Clinton Administration took a cautious approach Monday to 
commenting on Mexico's partial election results, Mexican expatriates in 
Southern California offered passionate, conflicting views about the claim by 
Ernesto Zedillo, the ruling party's candidate, of a presidential victory. 
</P>
<P>
 A group called Hispanics for Zedillo, for example, convened a news conference 
at UCLA's Westwood campus to laud what they termed true democracy at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows the maturing of the Mexican political system," said an exultant 
Eddie Varon, a Los Angles-based activist for the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, or PRI, which nominated Zedillo as president. "We won it fairly." 
</P>
<P>
 But across town at his Eastside tortilleria, Jesus Cardenas was contemplating 
a strategy to protest what he and allies called electoral chicanery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fraud as usual," complained Cardenas, a supporter of the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party -- whose candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas (no relation), was 
finishing a distant third in preliminary returns. "The government party wants 
to impose another president." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the Administration said Monday that it was too early to say 
whether Mexico's election was free and fair, although one official described it 
as "peaceful . . . in spite of some irregularities." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Zedillo has claimed victory on the basis of partial returns, State 
Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said Washington would not comment on 
the results until more votes were officially counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it seemed clear that the Administration is prepared to work closely 
with Zedillo, a Yale-educated economist. Before the voting, a senior 
Administration official said that Washington expected a cooperative 
relationship regardless of which of the three top candidates won. 
</P>
<P>
 While insisting the United States had no favorite among the candidates, Shelly 
said the Administration was very concerned about the fairness of the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexican electoral law provides for redress of voting irregularities, and we 
certainly would expect that all credible charges of this kind, including if 
there were any raised about fraud, that they would certainly be very fully 
adjudicated under that system," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, and elsewhere in California, there was ample evidence Monday 
of the passions unleashed by Sunday's watershed national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The intense interest, and the different factions that have developed in 
Southern California among Mexican expatriates, are an indication of the 
region's diversity. Los Angeles County, with perhaps 3 million people of 
Mexican ancestry, boasts the largest such population outside Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Mexican politicians have made strong overtures to Mexican 
nationals in the United States, whose remittances home and other expenditures 
in Mexico are a crucial source of foreign currency. PRI officials have traveled 
here often, and Cardenas has made many trips to Los Angeles, most recently this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect in January, has 
further served to bolster cross-border ties. 
</P>
<P>
 And some in Mexico have called for amending electoral laws to allow Mexicans 
abroad to cast absentee ballots at consulates, a practice that could create a 
huge new voting bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans stayed up until early Monday to 
watch Spanish-language television for results. Others returned to vote in 
Mexico, where special booths were available for the few expatriates with proper 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Salvador Rizzo, a Mexican native who is a 22-year resident of 
Los Angeles, traveled to Mexico to observe the process firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzo, who heads the California chapter of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, 
said he was appalled that thousands of citizens nationwide were turned away 
because some voting booths ran out of ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other PRI opponents denounced Monday's results -- and what they termed 
Zedillo's premature claim of victory -- during an event held outside the 
Mexican Consulate across from MacArthur Park in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never heard of anyone being turned away from voting in the United States 
because of a lack of ballots," noted Virginia Reade Belmontez, a Mexican 
American and Cardenas supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Also disappointed were supporters of Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the National 
Action Party (PAN) candidate who appeared to be the second-place finisher. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Mexico want a change, and this is just more of the same," said 
Socorro Magana, a Mexican native and longtime U.S. resident who described 
herself as a former PRI supporter turned PAN backer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means Mexico will have the same poverty, the same problems, the same 
corruption as ever, and so many of our people will have to continue coming 
north to find work," she said.

</P>
<P>
 But even some PRI supporters still suspected the election was rigged. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were international witnesses, but they somehow do things illegally," 
said baker Jorge Morales, 23, a PRI supporter, at a Mexican bakery in Van Nuys. 
"Still, last time, ask anyone, 80% didn't believe in the vote. Now, maybe 60% 
don't believe in it. We're closer -- maybe next time the elections will be 
honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Mexican Americans worried that the election results would provoke a riot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried about my family," said Ricardo Ramirez, 32, a delivery truck 
driver unloading bread at a Van Nuys mini-mall, whose family lives in Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard there will be problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Some expressed a lack of faith that any election outcome would change things 
in Mexico, preventing those who hold power from abusing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing changes," said Cynthia Gonzalez, 25, of Van Nuys, as she shopped at a 
local carniceria . "They're all corrupt. Maybe it's better the PRI stays. . . . 
Now, things will remain more stable." 
</P>
<P>

OUSTED RWANDA LEADERSHIP DISPLAYS BRAVADO IN ZAIRE; AFRICA: EX-INFORMATION 
CHIEF SAYS HUTU CABINET, MILITARY ARE REORGANIZING. NO SERIOUS THREAT IS SEEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rwanda's ousted Hutu government has regrouped here on the Zairian border and 
is feebly rattling its rusty bloodstained saber. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as more Rwandans continue to file out of their country into 
semi-permanent refugee camps in Zaire, their shadowy, besieged, seldom-seen 
president and Cabinet are meeting and aspiring to a comeback. Maybe soon. Maybe 
in 30 years. Who can know? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a good thing the population has come along with the government. These 
people right now need to look after their own welfare. But, meanwhile, the 
government and the military are reorganizing," said Eliezer Niyitegeka, 
minister of information in the defeated government. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the new Tutsi-led army that has taken over Rwanda can be pressured to 
negotiate power-sharing with the old government, Niyitegeka said. If that is 
unlikely, he added, "we will prepare to go back by force, by violence." 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, Niyitegeka's threats seem no more than weak bluster. The 
army of his deposed government was routed in its short, sharp civil war with 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front, or RPF. Few take seriously the boast of a sudden 
resumption of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the old government is indelibly stained by blood. An estimated 
500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slain in a few short weeks beginning 
April 6. On that day, the nation's Hutu president was killed after a mysterious 
rocket blew his plane from the sky over the capital, Kigali. The hard-line 
replacement government, which includes Niyitegeka and President Theodor 
Sindikubwabo, was sworn in April 9. And the massacres raged on for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the long run, this old government still maintains vast control and 
influence over Rwanda's Hutu majority -- with more than 1 million of them now 
encamped in Zaire. It is no exaggeration to call this a government-in-exile of 
a people-in-exile. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitter post-colonial history of Rwanda also adds credibility to the old 
government's threats. After all, many of the Tutsi soldiers who now control 
Rwanda were born in refugee camps in Uganda a generation ago, the result of the 
same ethnic strife that sent today's Hutus fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Border refugee camps in this Central African region are nothing if not 
caldrons of hatred, boot camps for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 In a long interview Monday with The Times and the London Daily Telegraph, 
Niyitegeka talked about the prospects for reconciliation, the massacres and the 
Hutu view of justice. Now a refugee, he struck a temperate and controlled tone. 
It was a presentation at odds with the countervailing image of his government 
in power: a regime that tolerated, even encouraged, the butchering of Tutsis in 
retribution for the death of the Hutu president. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a member of the Cabinet at the time when this occurred, I accept 
collective responsibility," he said. "But not just the government is 
responsible. Every man is responsible -- even you. You didn't come to save 
these people." 
</P>
<P>
 Niyitegeka insisted that his record in Kigali was of a peacemaker, that as 
information minister he urged the massacres be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alixon DesForges, a Washington-based consultant to Human Rights 
Watch/Africa, an international monitoring group, said, "Numerous witnesses have 
reported that Niyitegeka was involved at a high level in planning and 
organizing the (Tutsi) massacre." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the information minister, he observed: "You ask, who committed the 
massacres? Every individual is responsible for his own actions, good or bad. If 
any member of the government is responsible for any reprehensible act, he will 
have to answer. But you cannot generalize and say the whole government is 
responsible for what happened. . . . If a British citizen kills someone, do you 
say that all British are killers? . . . It was as if evil forces rose up to 
cause this calamity." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he voiced the argument that has become standard fare in refugee 
conversation: "You cannot reconcile two peoples if only one of them is judged 
guilty. It's a matter of justice. What about Tutsis who killed Hutus? There has 
to be some kind of general amnesty for everybody. You have to forgive one 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the RPF army and its new civilian government are bent on 
punishment for the slaughter. Some officials have said the list of guilty could 
be as long as 30,000. The new government has said it will defer to an 
international war crimes investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 On other subjects, Niyitegeka said: 
</P>
<P>
 * Yes, the old government fled with the national treasury. "The government 
could not leave the money in Kigali, for the RPF are just robbers. . . . We 
didn't take it to spend it, but to protect it." 
</P>
<P>
 * He recognized that the presence of a shadow government, plotting its 
comeback, poses a dilemma for host nation Zaire. Publicly, Zaire has asked the 
United Nations to find another nation that will grant the Rwandan government 
amnesty. "But I don't see how they can force us to go to another country. We 
are human beings first. We are refugees." 
</P>
<P>
 Niyitegeka said the old government is not concerned about an internal 
challenge to its authority.

ILLINOIS WOMAN, 25, CHARGED IN FIRE DEATHS OF EIGHT CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman was charged with eight counts of involuntary manslaughter Monday, one 
for each child she is accused of leaving alone before a house fire killed them. 
</P>
<P>
 Camilla Foulks, 25, also was charged with one count each of reckless conduct 
and endangering the life or health of a child. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire Aug. 14 killed eight children, all related and ranging in age from 5 
months to 7 years. An 8-year-old girl, whose identity has not been disclosed, 
was the sole survivor. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Foulks, mother of three of the victims, was supposed to have been 
baby-sitting the children, but was at a bar when her bungalow caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson County State's Atty. Mike Wepsiec said authorities have issued a 
summons for Foulks to appear in court on Sept. 12. He said she would not be 
arrested before then because she is not considered a flight risk and because 
she is still mourning the loss of her children, who were buried Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A conviction on an involuntary manslaughter charge carries a penalty of three 
to seven years in prison. The remaining charges are misdemeanors with maximum 
sentences of 364 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Clifford Manis said the fire probably was started by children 
playing with a lighter or matches and may have smoldered for an hour.

11 KILLED IN HEAD-ON CRASH OF 2 VEHICLES 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sports utility vehicle crossed the center line, slammed head-on into a sedan 
packed with passengers and burst into flames, killing all 11 people in both 
vehicles, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead included five children, ages 2 to 6, who were among the nine people 
in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred Sunday evening when the southbound Chevy Blazer collided 
with the northbound Chevrolet Caprice, Lt. Bob Dale of the state patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blazer's fuel line apparently ruptured, and all the victims were severely 
burned in the ensuing fire, Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one reported witnessing the accident on Alternate U.S. 97 about two miles 
north of this central Washington city, and it was not known how fast the 
vehicles were traveling, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather was clear and dry at the time of the crash.

U.S. TRIES TO DISCOURAGE CUBAN RAFTERS; EXODUS: WARNINGS OF THE DETENTION 
POLICY AND PLEAS TO STAY AT HOME ARE REPEATED. BUT THOUSANDS CONTINUE TO RIDE 
THE WAVES TOWARD FLORIDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, having failed so far to slow the exodus from Cuba, 
on Monday anxiously sought new ways to discourage the Cubans' flight and find 
new places to house the thousands who have taken to sea. 
</P>
<P>
 As the daily tally of Cuban immigrants mounted, despite the new U.S. policy of 
rounding them up and detaining them, officials in Washington publicly expressed 
hope that the Cubans will heed U.S. pleas to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, however, officials conceded that the warnings are being ignored and 
that the numbers of fleeing Cubans will soon overwhelm the facilities being 
cobbled together to contain them. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials, meeting frantically during the day on the refugee 
crisis, decided to increase the frequency of broadcasts to Cuba detailing the 
new U.S. policy and describing the fate awaiting those who lash together boards 
and inner tubes and set sail for Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite four days of efforts to communicate the change in U.S. policy and 
stanch the outflow, 2,338 Cubans were picked up by Coast Guard and Navy vessels 
on Monday. The total for Sunday was 1,293. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to stand for another Mariel boat lift," White House Chief of 
Staff Leon E. Panetta said Monday morning, as evidence steadily grew that just 
such a mass migration is well under way. The Mariel exodus of 1980 saw 125,000 
Cubans, some of them criminals and mental patients, arrive in the United States 
over five months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effort right now is to show very strongly that we're going to detain 
these people," Panetta added. "We are not going to simply take the same 
business-as-usual approach here." 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Meissner, the nation's top immigration officer, explicitly warned that 
Cubans who set sail for Florida will be sent to detention centers with no hope 
of admission to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Cubans picked up at sea and taken to the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo 
Bay, Cuba, apparently believe that the detention will be only temporary and 
that eventually they will be allowed to live in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But Meissner, asked whether any Cubans rescued at sea have any possibility of 
legally reaching the United States, answered flatly: "No, they do not." 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno told reporters at the Justice Department: "We're trying 
to make the point that it's terrifically unsafe for Cubans to take to the 
Florida Straits when there is a legitimate way to immigrate here." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States permits the legal immigration of about 28,000 Cubans a year, 
but they must apply at the U.S. interest section in Havana to receive an 
immigrant visa. Many Cubans avoid the process because it is time-consuming and 
subjects them to possible harassment by the government of dictator Fidel 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming that an undetermined number of would-be immigrants have lost their 
lives at sea, Reno said: "There have been a number of incidents of rafts 
floating empty in the water." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials on Monday also stepped up efforts to find additional havens in the 
Caribbean to house the Cubans. A makeshift refugee camp at Guantanamo Bay will 
accommodate up to 10,000, but that figure is expected to be reached within a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Two nations -- Suriname and the Turks and Caicos Islands -- have tentatively 
agreed to accept 2,500 Cubans each, but final agreements have not been reached, 
and the facilities are not yet in place. Panama is expected to allow the United 
States to house several thousand Cubans on U.S. military bases there, but 
agreement must await the new government's taking office on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 If the exodus continues at anything like its current pace, however, all the 
camps will reach capacity in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials announced that ships are being diverted from stations in 
the Atlantic and Caribbean to form a cordon around Cuba, although officials 
ruled out the imposition of a formal military blockade. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry said Monday that the U.S. military is doing 
its best to save those Cubans found drifting in the Florida Straits and would 
send additional ships to assist in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perry pointedly warned Cubans that U.S. capabilities are stretched thin 
and those who take to the sea are engaging in "a very dangerous operation," 
with their best hope being indefinite detention and the worst alternative 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 At a brief press conference in Key West, Fla., where Perry flew to consult 
with Navy and Coast Guard officials involved in Cuban rescue efforts, the 
defense secretary said that 25 ships -- 19 Coast Guard cutters and six Navy 
ships -- already are plucking Cubans from the sea. The Coast Guard also has 
deployed 35 smaller boats and 30 aircraft in the Cuban rescue mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said that three more Navy ships and several more Coast Guard vessels 
will arrive in the next 24 to 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the U.S. government's attempts to keep Cubans on their own shores 
appear to be failing, warnings to U.S. residents not to try to smuggle Cubans 
into the country seem to be more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Friday, three suspected groups of smugglers have been intercepted by the 
Coast Guard. The latest was intercepted late Sunday night in a small motorboat. 
Two suspected smugglers and two Cubans were aboard, according to Coast Guard 
Chief Warrant Officer Jerry Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it is unlikely that smugglers are evading the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "With that many Coast Guard ships out there, I'd be surprised if they were 
sneaking by us," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration official admitted that U.S. efforts to communicate the new 
policy and to discourage Cuban flight have fallen short. Even if Cubans are 
hearing the message that the U.S. door has been slammed shut, they're ignoring 
it, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the message that they're not going to the United States is getting 
through, but people still think they're going to make it eventually. People 
seem to have decided that even if they have to sit in some sort of safe haven 
or detention center, it'll still be a quicker way to get to the United States 
than if they apply legally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do a better job of getting that word out," the official said. He 
also suggested that Castro is not only encouraging dissident elements to leave 
but also is jamming U.S. broadcasts describing the new anti-immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>

and Norman Kempster in Washington contributed to this story.

BLOCKADE IDEA FLOATED ON TROUBLED WATERS; CUBA: CALLS FOR TOUGH ACTION TO HALT 
REFUGEES ARE SOUNDED. BUT STRATEGISTS SEE MANY PITFALLS, INCLUDING ADDED 
PRESSURE ON CUBANS TO LEAVE ISLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Military strategists said Monday that there probably is only one effective way 
to stop the flow of refugees from Cuba: Impose a naval blockade around the 
island and stop all vessels and aircraft that might be carrying would-be 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 A blockade worked in Cuba in 1962, when the United States "quarantined" the 
island to prevent further delivery of Soviet missiles to the regime of Fidel 
Castro. It has generally worked to embargo trade in Bosnia, Iraq and Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 And now some officials and Cuban American leaders are calling for a blockade 
around present-day Cuba as well -- not only to stop boat people headed for the 
United States but also perhaps to seal off the island from any trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, even raised the idea on a 
national television interview program on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mere suggestion sends chills through the ranks of those who would have 
to set up and operate the blockade and among policy-makers who, having failed 
to improve the situation with their own solutions, still think that an embargo 
could make it worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics said a blockade would require a massive effort that would take 
warships away from military operations around Haiti. It might even backfire, 
they said, by worsening conditions in Cuba so much that more Cubans would try 
to flee, thus straining U.S. detention facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Under international law, it also might be considered an act of war -- possibly 
prompting Castro to launch a last-ditch military stand that could put ordinary 
Cubans at risk and draw the United States into a tense military confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite Panetta's remarks, the Administration was quickly backing away 
from the idea Monday. "That's not part of our present planning," Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry said at a press conference in Key West. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, the Administration already has imposed something of a blockade. The 
Navy announced Monday that it has deployed several more warships to help Coast 
Guard vessels pick up refugees. The two services have set up a picket line 
spanning the Florida Straits. 
</P>
<P>
 But naval warfare experts said an expansion of that effort -- perhaps to a 
total economic embargo -- would require as many as 50 warships and dozens of 
aircraft, siphoning them away from operations in Haiti, drug enforcement duties 
and other assigned tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a major naval undertaking," said retired Navy Rear Adm. Eugene 
Carroll Jr., director of the Center for Defense Information, a liberal-oriented 
defense monitoring group. "We'd have to use practically everything we could 
scrape up on short notice." 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, Carroll and other military analysts said, the blockade would be 
run as an extension of the current picket line. U.S. warplanes and ships would 
search for Cuban rafters and for any vessels and aircraft bound to or from 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 They would stop them, demand that they identify their passengers and cargo, 
and force them to alter course. Militarily, the operation would be relatively 
straightforward, Carroll asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 But military analysts said that imposing a naval blockade would be costly and 
fraught with other difficulties that together raise serious doubts about the 
wisdom of such an operation. Among the problems: 
</P>
<P>
 * Although blocking the shipment of crucial imports, such as petroleum, 
undoubtedly would hurt Cuba's economy, experts said that it also could 
intensify pressures for more Cubans to want to leave the island, exacerbating 
the refugee problem for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk is that they'd be creating the same sort of problem in Cuba that has 
resulted in Haiti -- that the embargo creates such pressure on the economy that 
people will want to leave all the more, said Dan Goure, analyst for the Center 
for Strategic and International Studies, a middle-of-the-road Washington think 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't work the first time, so why would you want to repeat it?" Goure 
said. "They'd be buying themselves an explosion -- and nobody wants that." 
</P>
<P>
 * If the flow of refugees from Cuba increases markedly, the United States 
would have difficulty in detaining and housing them. The refugee compounds at 
the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, already are nearly full, and other 
countries are proving slow to offer help. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some critics fear that, unless Castro agrees soon to take back the 
refugees who are being held at Guantanamo Bay, the United States could be in 
the embarrassing position of appearing to operate long-term detention camps -- 
a black eye for any democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 * While U.S. vessels are unlikely to face any serious challenge, there still 
is the chance that U.S. warships or planes might have to fire on a third 
country's vessels or aircraft, setting off a diplomatic incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms that the Administration already has set for similar blockades 
in Haiti, Bosnia and Iraq, the only way to give the operation legitimacy would 
be to seek a mandate from the United Nations Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But policy analysts cautioned that winning such approval likely would prove 
difficult, since the issue is regarded primarily as a regional problem that 
some countries, such as China, may not be willing to help resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a much tougher kind of deal," Goure said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1962 naval blockade during the Cuban missile crisis was aimed almost 
solely at stopping Soviet ships from delivering missiles to the Castro regime. 
The United States used dozens of warships, including eight aircraft carriers 
and hundreds of aircraft. It lasted six days. 
</P>
<P>
 But military experts said that blockading Cuba now would be closer in size and 
scope to the naval embargoes that are in force outside Bosnia, Iraq and Haiti, 
involving ship-by-ship interdiction.

GUANTANAMO TENTS BETTER THAN LIFE IN CUBA, REFUGEES SAY; DETENTION: STOPPED 
SHORT ON THEIR JOURNEYS TO FLORIDA, THE BOAT PEOPLE SAY THEY WOULD HAVE LEFT 
REGARDLESS OF THE NEW NO-IMMIGRATION POLICY.

 This military outpost is a long way from the glitter of Miami and the 
mind-boggling liberties of America, a desolate place where hastily constructed 
tents served as home Monday to at least 1,200 Cuban refugees for whom real 
freedom now remains little more than a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they would have put to sea anyway, the first Cuban boat people to arrive 
here said, even if they had known before pushing off that the U.S. vessels that 
scooped them up over the weekend would take them to the southeast side of this 
troubled island rather than to America. 
</P>
<P>
 Living inside the barbed-wire fences of a 92-year-old U.S. Navy base is 
preferable to the bleak life afforded by the Castro regime, they said. Besides, 
they view Guantanamo Bay as nothing more than a temporary stopover en route to 
America -- despite U.S. insistence that none will be allowed to emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it was crazy to embark on such a venture, to have six people in a 
12-foot boat, but to stay in Cuba was even more crazy," said tiny Silvio 
Herrera, dressed in dirty blue slippers and cutoff shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all figured that we would be better off taking our chance at sea," he 
said. "I am destined to live in the United States. God has told me this." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera's belief mirrors that of many Cubans arriving here, even though in 
Washington on Monday, Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, said flatly that those picked up at sea will never be 
permitted to live in the United States -- unless they somehow can return to 
Cuba and apply through normal channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner said that Cubans who apply for immigrant visas at the U.S. diplomatic 
mission in Havana have a much better chance of emigrating. Policy now permits 
nearly 28,000 immigrants a year, a quota that is about 90% unfilled so far this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Cuban raft people now at Guantanamo Bay do not have the option of 
returning to Havana and applying for a visa because there is no provision for 
sending Cubans home. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite four days of effort to persuade Cubans to stay in their country, at 
least 3,000 have been picked up by Coast Guard and Navy vessels in the last two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arriving in Guantanamo on Monday had gone to sea aboard makeshift boats 
-- many of them nothing more than truck inner tubes lashed together with cheap 
rope and twine. Now these refugees, known as balseros , or rafters, were right 
back on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 They kept their composure despite an uncertain future within colorless camps 
without running water or mail delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we left Havana, we had absolutely no idea we would end up in a place 
like this," said Oreste Garcia Diaz, a 33-year-old former fry cook who sprawled 
upon a sweaty cot. "This may be an American base, but it is not really America. 
My son said this to me today. He said: 'Daddy, we are in limbo.' And he is 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 At 1:45 a.m. Monday, the first 168 Cuban refugees arrived aboard the Cutter 
Confidence, followed shortly thereafter by the cutters Decisive and Durable, 
carrying 223 and 184 refugees, respectively. Shortly before noon, the Cutter 
Courageous docked with another 168 refugees as officials awaited the arrival of 
the Cutter Mohawk with the largest human cargo of the day: 345. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid a near-desert landscape dotted with cacti and scrub brush, the newly 
arrived clung to the fence of a dusty campsite where they were held for 
processing -- shirtless young men, old women and bearded grandfathers hoisting 
preschool children atop their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 As a group of U.S. reporters approached, many yelled in unison: "Come in, our 
friends!" and "Take us to Miami!" Others foisted upon visitors slips of paper 
with information to call relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after midnight Monday, Herrera was among the first Cubans to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaking his head, he told of the dangerous journey in a small raft that was 
little match for the ocean. Severe storms hit soon after he set sail, spoiling 
the food and water supply and for a short time throwing two of his five 
passengers into shark-infested waters. 
</P>
<P>
 For Herrera, the news that dashed his hopes for instant freedom came minutes 
after a Coast Guard cutter appeared on the horizon late Friday. That's when he 
heard the announcement over a military radio that he would not be taken to 
America, that he and the others were headed back for Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried," he said. "I knew we should have left earlier, days or weeks before. 
Now we are caught in the middle. But at least we are out of Castro's Cuba. That 
much is a victory in itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Rojas, a 24-year-old professional diver, said he is not angry at 
President Clinton for his sudden about-face in policy or even the fact that his 
tiny fishing boat was intercepted just five miles from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I just want him to keep his word. I want to live in America, so I can 
help my country, send back money to overthrow Fidel Castro. Doesn't Mr. Clinton 
understand this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Michael Williams told reporters that the base 
was gearing up for more than 10,000 refugees. "Right now, we don't know what 
our limitations are here," he said as a small Cuban boy in a bathing suit 
tugged at his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our tents are designed to hold 16 to 20 people. Do we want to expand that to 
40 or more? Will the boat people just keep coming? Your guess is as good as 
mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Down at the harbor, when the Cutter Courageous pulled into port, many of the 
refugees on board thrust their hands through the boat's rail-side netting like 
prisoners held behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 As he looked on, Navy cook Darryl Meyers described the scene near the Florida 
Keys two days before. "I have never seen anything like it -- these little 
ramshackle boats as far as the eye could see. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them were shooting off flares. Others had these battery-run 
fluorescent lights. There were so many pregnant women. It seemed a little risky 
for them to be out on the open sea. They must have wanted to get out of Cuba 
real bad." 
</P>
<P>
 At a crowded U.S. government processing hut, a soldier looked at two men in 
baseball caps and smiled. "Welcome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men frowned in unison. "Welcome to where?" they replied. "Where are we? 
The United States? Cuba? Somewhere in between?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, Diaz gazed at the sky and saw two vultures hovering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Castro has sent them here to spy on us," he said sadly. "Look, they are 
laughing at us. Old Fidel has won again." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, said Herrera. No matter how long it takes, he and his companions will 
await their next opportunity to make a run at the American shores and their 
dream of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing will stop us."

APPLY AS IMMIGRANTS, CUBANS TOLD 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is advising Cubans who want to come to the United 
States to apply as immigrants, pointing to a huge unfilled quota as an 
incentive. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year 2,059 Cubans have been accepted as immigrants. Another 2,300 
have gained entry as political refugees -- a channel that is now severely 
restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba, like most countries, is allocated up to 7% of the worldwide total for 
immigration to the United States, or 27,845. Nearly 25,800 slots are still 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials said Monday that only five countries use up their 
quotas -- China, the Dominican Republic, India, Mexico and the Philippines.

OLYMPIC COVER-UP ALLEGED; DRUG TESTING: NINE POSITIVE RESULTS AT 1984 LOS 
ANGELES GAMES WERE KEPT SECRET, OFFICIAL SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine positive drug tests at the 1984 Summer Olympics were allegedly covered up 
and documentation subsequently destroyed, it was revealed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Catlin, director of the UCLA facility that handled the Olympic drug 
testing, told The Times that a number of positive results were never reported 
and that he never knew why. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin's comments come on the heels of reports on BBC television and in the 
Times of London that questioned the handling of drug testing during the L.A. 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
 A BBC report talked of a break-in and shredded documents, as if the latest 
Olympic drug scandal had borrowed pages from the Watergate and Iran-Contra 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the report's main sources was Craig Krammerer, Catlin's associate in 
1984, who said that five of the nine tests showed the presence of anabolic 
steroids. The others had traces of testosterone, the male sex hormone, and 
ephedrine, the substance for which soccer star Diego Maradona was kicked out of 
the World Cup. All the substances are banned by the International Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Krammerer, now a drug researcher in New Jersey, said the laboratory sent its 
findings to IOC officials and waited for a reply to test the second samples. 
Technicians split urine specimens into "A" and "B" samples for separate 
verification, which is a standard procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 During 15 days of operation, the UCLA laboratory tested 1,502 athletes. Twelve 
positives were reported, including two medal winners -- a Swedish weightlifter 
and Finnish distance runner. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest number -- 157 -- were tested the day before the Olympics ended. 
The nine positives allegedly ignored came during the competition's last two 
days. Among the marquee events held in the final two days were the men's 
shotput, women's discus, men's 1,500, women's 100 hurdles, men's marathon and 
boxing finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't keep track of each case," Catlin told The Times. "We were so 
busy. These other things going on didn't sink in until sometime afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Usher, who was vice president of the L.A. Olympic Organizing Committee, 
dismissed the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where (a cover-up) would come from but not from the LAOOC," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Daly, the LAOOC's chief medical officer, said he hears drug rumors after 
every Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even from (South) Korea (in 1988) and Russia (in 1980)," he said. "I always 
discount it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the BBC report, Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the IOC, 
Peter Uebberoth, president of the LAOOC, and Prince Alexandre DeMerode, 
president of the IOC medical commission, discussed the drug positives in a 
meeting. A fourth person present at the meeting told the BBC that DeMerode 
refused to go along with any attempt to cover up the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Beckett, a former member of the IOC medical commission, said the plan 
was carried out anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Without DeMerode's cooperation, it was more difficult because the Belgian 
prince was one of the few officials who had access to the athletes' names and 
corresponding code of their urinalysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA laboratory sent its coded results to DeMerode, who connected the 
names and informed the athletes and their coaches of the positives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the nine positives, DeMerode never got the chance. Beckett said 
someone broke into his hotel room, stole the data and shredded it. 
</P>
<P>
 "(DeMerode) told us they had taken them and shredded it," said Beckett, who 
was removed from the commission because of a disagreement during the Barcelona 
Games. "There was no way to connect the documents with the person." 
</P>
<P>
 IOC officials refused to comment on the specific allegations, but pointed to 
the organization's long standing against performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been tremendous progress in the last 10 years of the management and 
control of doping," UCLA's Catlin said. "I can't work with people fooling 
around. These people run very credible programs." 
</P>
<P>
 One explanation given for the missing positives was that the IOC sent control 
tests to check the laboratory's reliability. But Krammerer said IOC officials 
informed the laboratory after they caught each control. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were two," he said Monday. "We caught both of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted in Toronto, Beckett, 74, said he did not speak out earlier because 
he thought it was best for the Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, it was a wrong decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckett, who retired from Kings College of London nine years ago, also 
implicated Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation, as helping devise a plan to cover up the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckett alleged Nebiolo tried to change a positive of a distance runner in 
1984, but other IAAF officials refused to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebiolo could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "I broke rank with good intent," Beckett said. "Somebody has got to stop this 
madness." 
</P>

RAVITCH DERIDED BY FEHR; BASEBALL: HEAD OF PLAYERS UNION CALLS NEGOTIATOR FOR 
OWNERS A 'HATCHET MAN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 If federal mediators had hoped to defuse the rhetoric in baseball's collective 
bargaining dispute, the message was not received. 
</P>
<P>
 There were more insults than insights Monday, most coming from Donald Fehr, 
executive director of the striking players union, who said the owners' 
negotiator, Richard Ravitch, lacked independence and was strictly a "hatchet 
man" for the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 He accused Ravitch of shedding "crocodile tears" for those left unemployed by 
the strike while continuing to draw his $750,000-a-year salary. Fehr added that 
he has seen no evidence that Wednesday's resumption of negotiations with owners 
and club executives present for the first time will produce anything more than 
a "Hallelujah chorus to the salary cap and the great job Dick is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr, who stopped receiving his $1-million annual salary when the strike began 
on Aug. 12, also compared the owners' plan to establish a daily rotation of 
representatives -- if, in fact, they go past Wednesday -- to that of a hockey 
game in which players shuttle on and off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they really do that, there would be no continuity and an indication they 
were not treating it seriously," Fehr said. "They would have nobody there on 
Thursday who knew what had been said on Wednesday. It would defeat the purpose 
of having a core group present on an ongoing basis. I'd be quite surprised if 
they treated this in such a cavalier fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Declining to exchange insults, Ravitch said: "The last time I found name 
calling to be meaningful I was in grade school." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I don't tell Don who to bring to the table. The owners have busy 
schedules. I can't tell you who will be here every day, but I can tell you that 
our response and our proposal will not change, no matter who's at the table." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting commissioner Bud Selig said Monday that the Executive Council had 
chosen 12 owners and club officials to assist Ravitch and added that Fehr has 
never hesitated to bring different players to different meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not to say we won't have constants at every meeting, but we're just 
trying to be efficient," Selig said, adding that the 12 have a wide range of 
backgrounds and expertise and cover the big-, middle- and small-market 
spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Selig, speaking from Milwaukee, nor Ravitch would say who or how many 
would be on the first team Wednesday -- it might be five or six chosen on the 
basis of the issues to be discussed, Selig said -- but it is expected to 
include Selig's daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb, the Milwaukee Brewers' vice 
president-general counsel; Minnesota Twin General Manager Andy MacPhail, 
Philadelphia Phillie Executive Vice President David Montgomery, and the Chicago 
White Sox's influential owner, Jerry Reinsdorf. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr had no comment on the composition of the ownership group, but a union 
source said the one certainty was Reinsdorf would be present "to make sure he 
was in position to rein in the horses if he has to." 
</P>
<P>
 The pool also includes Atlanta Brave Board Chairman Bill Bartholomay and 
President Stan Kasten; Kansas City Royal President David Glass, Boston Red Sox 
CEO John Harrington; Houston Astro owner Drayton McLane; Colorado Rockie owner 
Jerry McMorris; the St. Louis Cardinals' retiring president, Stuart Meyer, and 
Toronto Blue Jay President Paul Beeston. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool does not include George Steinbrenner, Peter Angelos or Marge Schott, 
who were critical of Ravitch and his strategy last week. There are no 
representatives from either of the New York teams or any of the five California 
teams, and only three own controlling interest of their respective teams -- 
McLane, McMorris and Reinsdorf. However, Dodger President Peter O'Malley, 
reached in Los Angeles, said, "the term owner is difficult to define" in many 
cases and he had no problem with the committee makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm expecting progress and wish them well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sides remain polarized, however, the union opposing the salary cap and the 
owners still attempting to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington, the Red Sox CEO, appeared at a news conference with Ravitch and 
insisted there is unanimity regarding the need for a new system, despite the 
economic and geographic diversity among ownership and occasional comments 
questioning certain aspects of the process, the proposal or both. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to support Dick Ravitch," Harrington said. "Every owner is on the 
train." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr, however, continues to suspect it's all window dressing and that the 
owners agreed to mediation "to avoid a black eye publicly." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr and Ravitch addressed procedural issues in a 20-minute meeting with 
mediators Monday, then Ravitch briefed the ownership group. The sides will meet 
separately with mediatorstoday, with between 25 and 40 players expected to 
attend, Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 How many of those players attend Wednesday's negotiations, Fehr said, is 
primarily up to the mediators, "but I hope the owners are past the thin-skin 
stage, because I don't expect the negotiations to be pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
 Today is Day 12 of the strike, and there have been no negotiations since it 
began. Fehr said again that the owners have set the clock ticking with the goal 
of breaking the union and unilaterally implementing their system. He again 
criticized Ravitch for delaying resumption of the talks -- "all of this is to 
give the appearance of activity where there is none" -- and said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick is not an independent figure here. He's the hatchet man for the owners. 
The owners want to drastically lower salaries, and he's the guy who has to get 
it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch merely shrugged and said the calendar through Wednesday was set by the 
mediators, and that -- independence having nothing to do with it -- he has 
always worked for the owners, "who are here to dispel the myth that they're not 
of a common view."

LONG ROAD STILL AHEAD FOR RAIDER; PRO FOOTBALL: RUNNING BACK ROBINSON IS 
INELIGIBLE FOR FIRST SIX WEEKS OF SEASON AFTER BEING PUT ON INJURED RESERVE 
LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Greg Robinson knew. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't need to look at the concerned expressions on the trainers' faces as 
they hunched over him on the frozen surface of Rich Stadium that cold December 
day. He didn't need to look into the eyes of the examining physician. Nor did 
he need to monitor the subsequent tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's ears had already told him what his eyes would later confirm. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as his brief journey around the left side of the offensive line was 
cut short by a loud popping sound in his left knee, Robinson knew he was 
seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 As he lay there, Robinson saw his whole season, if not his career, flash 
before his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The tailback had begun as an eighth-round draft choice, not given much chance 
to make an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time he took a handoff from quarterback Jeff Hostetler on the first 
play of the third quarter that day in December, Robinson had run to the top of 
the Raider rushing chart. The three yards he picked up on the play that ended 
his season gave him a team-leading 591 and a 3.8-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Robinson underwent arthroscopic surgery on the knee, which first had 
been injured at Northeast Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, he had a torn ligament, but it was hoped that he might be able to 
get back on the field in time for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Robinson watched helplessly from the sideline as the Raiders were 
eliminated by the same Buffalo Bills who had ended his own season prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
 By early February, he was undergoing major reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The road back suddenly seemed a lot longer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Every day of camp this year, the Raiders rose early at their Oxnard training 
site, pulled on their uniforms, took a deep breath and waded into a long day of 
double workouts, agonizing minutes on the weight machines, endless meetings and 
long, dreary film sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 For Robinson, though, the days in Oxnard consisted of a monotonous routine of 
jogging, lifting weights, watching, more watching, lifting weights and jogging. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, he was watching. 
</P>
<P>
 While his teammates could tell themselves that training camp would soon end 
and the rewards of the regular season would be upon them, there was no such 
solace for Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he had to watch while the Raiders brought in veteran Harvey Williams 
and drafted rookie Calvin Jones to compete for his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real tough," he said. "These are hard times. I can learn a lot from 
looking at the backs and the linemen work. But for me, it's really just about 
looking right now. I'm tired of coming out and seeing people do my job and 
knowing that if I was OK, I'd be doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating. It's horrible. It's miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 And that was on his better days. 
</P>
<P>
 On others, Robinson would awaken in his Oxnard room, stare at the ceiling and 
agonize at the thought of getting up and resuming his seemingly interminable 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to stay in my room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he didn't. Instead, he sought out his source of inspiration, fellow 
running back Ty Montgomery, who overcame a similar injury in college and became 
the Raiders' starting tailback in place of Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I feel down, I talk to him," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 And what does Montgomery tell him? 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to give him positive advice," Montgomery said. "Sure he wishes he was 
out there. But why fool yourself? He'll know when it's time. Nobody else can 
tell him. When he gets down, I tell him it happened for a reason. I tell him 
it's so that he can get a grasp on life." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson does take comfort from being only 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you play this game long enough, (an injury) is going to happen sooner or 
later," he said. "It's better that it happens when you're younger because then 
you'll be able to recover better." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson is also heartened by the belief that, when he does return, he will be 
better than before. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the year went on, I studied more film," he said. "I took it upon myself to 
make things happen. I got more confident. And I got more patient. In the 
beginning I wasn't waiting for the holes to open." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether lying in his bed in Oxnard or standing on the field, Robinson can 
never seem to get one picture out of his mind, the picture of himself churning 
around the left side that day in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember everything about that play," he said. "Where I ran, who hit me, 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have been saying all along that Robinson wouldn't be available 
until midseason at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, they made that official by putting him on the injured 
reserve/physically unable to perform list, making him ineligible for the first 
six weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are hopeful it won't be too much longer than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trainers say he is ahead of schedule," Coach Art Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Robinson: "I don't have any time frame. I don't even know if I'm going to 
play this year. I can be confident, but my body is the key. I can't control 
that. If I'm able to perform this year, that would be a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Robinson is merely happy that the Oxnard phase of training camp is 
over and he's able to work out at the team's El Segundo headquarters and then 
go home at night and get away from the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how I survived as long as I did," he said. 
</P>

SECOND WIND; BURNED OUT A YEAR AGO, UCLA'S GREENWOOD APPEARS ENERGIZED AND 
READY FOR SENIOR YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Carl Greenwood was sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Homesick, heartsick -- but mainly sick of football after 13 years in pads, 
having begun as an 8-year-old in Pop Warner competition. 
</P>
<P>
 An NFL future didn't look all that inviting. Neither did two more years at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a cornerback in August of 1993, and ahead were twice-daily practice 
sessions, leading to a season-opening game against California at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Been there, he told A.J. Christoff, UCLA's defensive back coach, who 
recognized burnout right away. Done that, he told Marvin Goodwin, teammate, 
soul mate and running mate at safety, who understood that something had to be 
done to make the game fun again for Greenwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwood couldn't wait to get out of Texas as a high school senior. Now he 
couldn't wait to get back home as a college junior. 
</P>
<P>
 His lifeline stretches 1,800 miles, from Westwood to Corpus Christi, in south 
Texas, where Carl Greenwood Sr. had sat a 3-year-old Carl Jr. alongside to 
watch the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Oilers on television and had taught him to 
throw, kick and catch a football. Carl Sr., a former longshoreman, had also 
taught Carl Jr. about the value of an education, and the reminder came through 
again over the telephone, first with the advice of a religious man and then 
with practicality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised when he said he wanted to give up football and come home," 
Carl Sr. said. "I told him to pray. Then I told him he should stick it out to 
see where it takes him, and I reminded him how many people would like to have 
the opportunity he had. He was burned out on football, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Jr. respects his father, who has usually known best, and he stayed at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank goodness, said Christoff, who had a plan for Greenwood that involved 
throwing him to the wolves. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was our best cornerback," Christoff said, and set about turning Greenwood 
into a target, having him cover the opposition's best receiver week after week 
until the Bruins' other cornerback, Teddy Lawrence, was ready to share the 
load. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same thing we had done with Carlton Gray the year before," Christoff 
said. "We like to match up the best with the best. No matter how good your 
scheme is, if your people aren't up to performing, you're in a tough 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge helped. So did Goodwin, who decided Greenwood didn't laugh 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and I would sometimes sit together on the side in practice and watch the 
younger players," Greenwood said. "We would crack at them, at their mistakes, 
and it would make practice go by faster." 
</P>
<P>
 He was energized again, and Stanford's Justin Armour, San Diego State's Darnay 
Scott and Brigham Young's Eric Drage paid for it. All caught passes, but all 
were held scoreless by Greenwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Football was fun again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to play the best," he said. "How are you going to find out how good 
you are if you don't play the best?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even practice became fun again. It offered a daily test against J.J. Stokes, 
an All-American receiver, who got one, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like covering him," Greenwood said. "Everybody talks about how good Stokes 
is, and I say, 'Come on. Let me see.' I do pretty well against him, and I think 
he'll tell you I'm the toughest defensive back he has to face all season." 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely," said Stokes. "He's unbelievably strong, definitely the strongest 
corner I face. Nobody jams me better. And he's fast. He's covered receivers 
with sprinters' speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why he hasn't gotten more attention. I think he is one of the 
top five cornerbacks in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwood has two messages for UCLA's receivers, considered by some to be the 
best group in college football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them they should be glad they don't have to face me on Saturday," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They help me get ready and get better," he said. "I don't face anybody any 
tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 It's all a physical and mental game within the game, the cornerback and the 
wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just you and the guy right there," said Greenwood. "You have to see who 
is the best man. It's what I like. You're out there on an island, and that's 
when you can show what you can do." 
</P>
<P>
 It's reward. And punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been beaten four times in three seasons, by his count. 
</P>
<P>
 The first to do it was Carl Pickens of Tennessee, an All-American now playing 
with the Cincinnati Bengals. Greenwood was a redshirt freshman, in his second 
game, the first as astarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never gotten beaten in high school, and I took it hard," Greenwood 
said. "I couldn't believe I was beaten that way because I'd never experienced 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 A call to Corpus Christi helped. The advice was to forget about it because if 
you don't, it will happen again. There is no time for brooding. 
</P>
<P>
 Christoff had told him the same thing, but . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I always say Dad was my first coach," Greenwood said. You always listen to 
your first coach." 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent a recurrence of burnout, the UCLA coaching staff sent Greenwood 
home this summer, while most of his teammates attended school and went through 
a workout program. 
</P>
<P>
 It helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even after last season, I wasn't sure I wanted another year here," Greenwood 
said. "I thought about coming out for the NFL draft last season, and somebody 
told me I would be drafted somewhere between the third and the fifth round -- 
maybe, with workouts, even higher. I didn't tell anybody, because I didn't want 
the pressure of dealing with the questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to think about if an extra year here would mean that much extra money 
for me in the NFL. Would going to school and putting up with what I had to put 
up with and not be paid be worth it? I really didn't like school that much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back because I thought it would be worth it. I thought I would make 
more money in the NFL if I stayed here another year. I hope to be in the top 15 
(in the NFL draft). That's my goal, the top 15." 
</P>
<P>
 The number is not merely convenient. A magazine told him he was a top-15 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Sr. told him he was two quarters from a UCLA degree in sociology. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's right," Carl Jr. said. "After all I've invested here, it would be crazy 
for me not to get my degree. I'm not going to school here for 4 1/2 years for 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the motivation, it has worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's come back rejuvenated," Christoff said. "He's a defensive back right out 
of the mold of Othello Henderson and Eric Turner and Matt Darby and Carlton 
Gray and all of the guys who have come out of UCLA to the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruin defensive backs have been picked in the draft for the last four years 
and seven of eight. Nine are playing in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwood wants to be the 10th, and then he wants to put Westwood in his 
rear-view mirror and get on back to Corpus Christi, Tex. And on with his life.

LAWYER: BONDS DIDN'T INITIATE ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Bonds' lawyer defended a strike-related reduction in the outfielder's 
spousal and child support payments and said the decision actually grew out of 
his wife's demand for more money. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not something Barry or myself initiated," Robert Nachshin said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was incorrectly reported in The Times on Sunday that Bonds had asked for 
the hearing. It was also incorrectly reported, based on information provided by 
the Associated Press, that Bonds' agent, Dennis Gilbert, had said in a 
declaration that Bonds could not afford $15,000 a month for "family support." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds, who signed a six-year, $43.75-million contract with the San Francisco 
Giants prior to the 1993 season, complied with the request that followed the 
Aug. 15 decision by San Mateo County Superior Court Commissioner George Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of the hearing, Taylor asked for Bonds' autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Stotter, an attorney who represents Bonds' wife, Sun, in the divorce 
proceeding, has complained the autograph request was inappropriate and left his 
client feeling "she was not playing on a level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who keeps pictures of Babe Ruth and other players in his courtroom, 
was on vacation and unavailable for comment, court officials said Monday. 
Bonds' lawyer said, however, that all parties agreed to have him decide the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Nachshin, the hearing involved a filing by Stotter on behalf of 
Sun Bonds, who was seeking to boost monthly support payments to about $130,000 
from $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple has two children, Nikolai, 4, and Shikari, 3. Divorce proceedings 
began in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor's decision cut Bonds' support payments to $7,500 a month, with Bonds 
remaining responsible for the mortgage, taxes and insurance on their Atherton 
estate. In all, Bonds is continuing to pay approximately $20,000 a month toward 
his family's support, his lawyer said.

 The Lakers and Phoenix Suns are discussing a trade that would send former Cal 
State Fullerton and Ventura College standout Cedric Ceballos back to Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Sedale Threatt is a top candidate to be traded because he can also be a 
backup point guard, one of the Suns' needs, and is close to Ceballos in salary. 
Ceballos, a small forward from Dominguez High in Compton, will make $2.1 
million in 1994-95, but the Lakers' best slot under the salary cap is $1.75 
million. He could agree to give back the $350,000 to help the deal, although 
that cannot happen before Friday because of a salary cap technicality. SCOTT

IRVAN'S LUNG INJURIES IMPROVED, BUT CONDITION REMAINS CRITICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Injuries to stock car driver Ernie Irvan's lungs continued to improve Monday, 
but he remained unconscious on a ventilator two days after crashing during 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan hit a wall at 176 m.p.h. Saturday at Michigan International Speedway in 
Brooklyn, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 A NASCAR official said Irvan apparently ran over debris on the track that cut 
the right front tire on his Ford Thunderbird. Irvan, 35, crashed into the wall 
in Turn 2 and sustained severe brain and lung injuries. He has been unconscious 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 He remained in critical but stable condition Monday at St. Joseph Mercy 
Hospital, Dr. Errol Erlandson said in a statement. A CAT-Scan showed no 
worsening or hemorrhaging in the brain, Erlandson said. 
</P>
<P>
 No additional injuries have been discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Recovery normally follows a slow course after neurological injuries, Erlandson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan, who has remained unconscious since the crash, was airlifted to the 
hospital minutes after the accident.

 Paul Kariya, the Mighty Ducks' unsigned 1993 first-round draft pick, and his 
agent, Don Baizley, met with Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira and President 
Tony Tavares Monday in Vancouver, but there was little to report from the 
talks, a club spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 With training camp scheduled to open in Anaheim in less than two weeks, 
Ferreira has said he is focusing his attention on trying to sign Kariya, who 
sat out last year in order to return to the University of Maine for a semester 
and play for Canada in the Olympics.Meeting for the first time since June, the 
parties have agreed to continue discussions but are believed to remain some 
distance apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya is seeking considerably more than the three-year, $4.2-million contract 
the Ducks gave to 1994 first-round pick Oleg Tverdovsky last week.

IRVINE, OTHER COUNTY TEAMS BEGIN PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Terry Henigan, Irvine High School football coach and taskmaster, was punctual. 
It was 8 a.m. and he bellowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone should know where they're going."  
</P>
<P>
 A group of Vaquero players sprinted onto the field and began workouts. 
Football season at Irvine High School had begun, as it had throughout Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina began practice a week ago to prepare for the Sept. 1 Akina Memorial 
Classic in Honolulu, as did Southern California Christian for its game Sept. 2 
against Kaahumanu Hou High in Maui. But the rest of the teams began two-a-day 
workouts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At Irvine, the Vaqueros have won three consecutive Southern Section 
championships and have not lost a Sea View League game in two seasons. Those 
accomplishments, though, are not talked about, not even in a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a word," Henigan said. "We don't allow three-peat shirts or anything like 
that. There are teams out there who set their goal as the Southern Section 
championship. We set ours much lower." 
</P>
<P>
 Such as . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to be Sea View League champions," he said. "Maybe we're not 
good enough. Maybe we'll have to lower our goal . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, coach-speak. Even they have to warm up. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . we take things one game at a time. I mean that sincerely." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to achieve those modest goals, the Vaqueros were run, quite 
literally, through the paces. By 6:30 p.m., they had been through two practices 
but were not finished. 
</P>
<P>
 They ended the day with 40 40-yard sprints. A little test to see who had been 
following the running program the last three weeks, the one mapped out by 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Under section rules, coaches can have no contact with players during that 
three-week time. So the players were on their own as far as conditioning goes. 
They were required to go through a weight-lifting period Monday, beginning at 7 
a.m., to see how much strength they had lost in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll know who's been working out," Henigan said. "We throw so much in our 
practice and they run so many routes, they better be in shape." 
</P>
<P>
 The first days of practice are for conditioning, under section rules. Players 
are not allowed to have contact or use blocking sleds or tackling dummies for 
three days. It also allows coaches time to organize. 
</P>
<P>
 That can be useful. At Irvine, 190 kids came out for football, 60 for the 
varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
 Henigan held a mass meeting of the entire program Monday evening, where he 
laid down the rules and policies of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day is not confusing for us," Henigan said. "I don't like change. 
We run the same practice year round." 
</P>
<P>
 That way, everyone knows where they're going.

IT'S SMOOTH SAILING FOR LANEE BUTLER THESE DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lanee Butler was angry, tired and wet, but she couldn't leave the water. Her 
sister wouldn't let her. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Butler promised to teach her younger sister how to windsurf, and she kept 
her word. Early in the initial lesson, however, Lanee discovered something 
unsettling: She disliked windsurfing -- intensely. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so hard," Lanee said. "I didn't have a lot of strength, and that board 
and sail were so big. I kept falling off." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Lanee's protests, Lynn insisted she keep trying. She did, reluctantly. 
Eleven years later, battling that sailboard is still among Lanee's best 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Butler, 24, is one of the top amateur female windsurfers in the world. 
And although the Dana Hills High and UC Irvine graduate has made her mark in 
national and international competition, she still longs for an Olympic medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that being draped in hardware is unfamiliar to Lanee Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week she was chosen the female boardsailor of the year by the United 
States Windsurfing Assn. Butler is the only two-time winner (male or female), 
having won the inaugural award in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The award covers the period of Sept. 1, 1993, through July 27, 1994. Butler 
consistently finished with the leaders in every event she entered, including 
two first-place finishes and five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty excited about the award," Butler said. "I've been sailing 
competitively for several years, and it gets harder and harder each year. There 
are so many people in the U. S. (who) do this type of sailing, and I'm thrilled 
that it is getting the respect it deserves." 
</P>
<P>
 After overcoming her initial disdain for the sport, Butler improved rapidly. 
Within a year she was racing friends in Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Windsurfing has come a long way," Butler said. "It's a lot easier to learn to 
windsurf now than when I started because there are smaller boards for kids. 
It's not that difficult once you learn what the wind is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler (5 feet 4, 125 pounds) sails Olympic-class Mistral One-Design boards, 
which are 12 feet long. Butler's board and sail have powered her around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 She competes annually in events in Europe, Greece, Japan and Russia, locales 
she expected to visit -- not frequent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been all over the world and it's been incredible," she said. "A lot of 
people don't know (windsurfing is) an international sport. It's super because 
you travel with all the same people, so it's like a small community of 
windsurfers going around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler is in Manitoba, Canada, competing in the Mistral World Championships, 
which continue through Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 She prepared for the event at the Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg, Russia, 
earning a bronze medal. She finished second at the last world championship in 
Kashiwazaki, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Competing is fun, but I also just love going out by myself," Butler said. 
"It's such a neat feeling to just be able to jump on your board and go wherever 
you want. I just love this sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked No. 2 in the nation by the windsurfing association, Butler is a 
five-year veteran of the U.S. national team. Moreover, she is the only woman to 
have represented the United States in sailboarding in the Olympics. Butler 
finished fifth at the 1992 Barcelona Games, the first to include her event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barcelona was great," she said. "Being the first girl and all, it was like 
history being made." 
</P>
<P>
 One male and one female will again represent the U. S. at the 1996 Atlanta 
Games. Butler hopes to compose half of that duo, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Olympic trials are the most important regattas to win," she said. "The 
races are going to get really tough leading into next year, but I think I've 
got a good shot."

LACHAPELLE AMONG NINE CUT BY THE RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: FORMER BRUIN WIDE RECEIVER 
SAYS THAT THE GAME HAS BECOME BORING TO HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ram wide receiver Sean LaChapelle caught a 38-yard touchdown pass in the final 
seconds of the Rams' 29-20 loss to the Raiders Saturday night, knowing full 
well it had little or no impact on his future with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 48 hours after the game, LaChapelle turned in his playbook Monday 
and left Rams Park for good. The Rams must be down to 60 players today and he 
was one of nine cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was telling my agent (Harold Daniels) that was one of the least 
(satisfying) touchdown catches I've made," said LaChapelle, a fifth-round draft 
pick from UCLA by the Rams last year. He failed to impress as a rookie and in 
training camp this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that catch didn't mean anything, and they threw me in the game with 
just 47 seconds left. If Richard Buchanan had not gone down with cramps, I 
wouldn't have been in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also cut wide receivers Greg McMurtry, Turhon O'Bannon and Jermaine 
Ross; offensive linemen Jeff Pahukoa and Ron Edwards, tight end Yonnie Jackson, 
running back Beno Bryant and punter Matt Turk. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight more must go today. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry, a free agent from the New England Patriots signed by the Rams in the 
off-season, walked out the second week of training camp, saying he didn't think 
he had a good chance to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned two days later, apologized to his teammates, but barely played and 
didn't catch a pass in three exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all their problems in the offensive line, the Rams still cut Pahukoa, 
who started three games last season but had hardly played in the exhibition 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting LaChapelle saves the Rams most of his $126,000 salary this season and 
might allow them to keep Buchanan, a second-year player who has looked strong 
in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 LaChapelle caught only two passes for 23 yards last season. The Rams appear 
set at wide receiver with Flipper Anderson, Jessie Hester, Nate Lewis, Todd 
Kinchen, rookies Isaac Bruce and Chris Brantley and possibly Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of depth at wide receiver," Coach Chuck Knox said. "It was just 
a question of numbers at that position." 
</P>
<P>
 After a standout college career, LaChapelle cited a lack of "that burning 
desire" to play the game for his failure to make an impact in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of things pulling me both ways -- my family, stuff back home 
and other things I want to do," he said. "Still, when I'm out here, I'm 
fighting to regain something I once had. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, football is really boring to me. The majority of it, I would say 
85%, is because I'm not playing." 
</P>
<P>
 LaChapelle said there is only one other team he would want to play for, the 
San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't want me, I don't think I'll play (this season)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might try to work out in the off-season and see if I miss it at all. If I 
don't, then there's no point in coming back."

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; NO SURPRISES AMONG THESE EIGHT CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Required to trim their roster from 80 players to 60 by 1 p.m. today, the 
Raiders cut eight players, none of whom figured to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders also put running back Greg Robinson, who is still recovering from 
off-season knee surgery, on the injured reserve/physically unable to perform 
list.That means that Robinson, who was not expected back until midseason at the 
earliest, cannot play for the first six weeks of the season. Had he been hurt 
after reporting to training camp, a transfer to injured reserve would have 
prevented Robinson from playing all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Mike Alexander was released, meaning he can sign with any other 
team. Put on waivers were quarterback Cree Morris, running back Wes Bender, 
defensive linemen Tim Rother and Akili Calhoun, linebacker Keith Franklin, wide 
receiver Joe Kralik and offensive lineman Quentin Neujahr. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven more cuts will be made today. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Kicker Jeff Jaeger, who tied an NFL record last season with 35 field goals, 
has maintained his accuracy in the exhibition season, making seven of eight 
attempts in four games. . . . Neither defensive lineman Chester McGlockton nor 
defensive back Lionel Washington practiced Monday, McGlockton because of a 
bruised leg and Washington because of a hamstring problem. Because Saturday's 
exhibition finale against the Houston Oilers at Houston is on artificial turf, 
a surface that worries coaches under the best of circumstances, McGlockton and 
Washington can expect to be used minimally, if at all, on Saturday. STEVE

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; FEDERAL HEARING WILL BE HELD ON HENLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cornerback Darryl Henley, who left practice Monday because of a hamstring 
injury, will attend a federal hearing today in Santa Ana to determine whether a 
travel ban will be lifted as part of his bail restrictions on federal 
drug-trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley and the Rams are waiting for a ruling to see if he can leave a 
seven-county area and play in Thursday night's exhibition at San Diego. 
Henley's lawyers filed a motion in U.S. District Court last week asking that 
the travel ban be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's trial is set for Jan. 10, and the travel ban would prevent him from 
playing in the Rams' eight road games in the regular season, starting with a 
Sept. 11 game at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the travel ban is lifted, there is a chance Henley wouldn't be able to 
play Thursday. He aggravated an injury to his right hamstring while covering 
Flipper Anderson in practice Monday and said he won't be able to practice 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After cutting nine players, the Rams face another tough decision this week -- 
what do they do with injured backup quarterback T.J. Rubley. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley, nursing tendinitis in his right elbow, could be put on the 
injured-reserve list, but would be unable to play for the rest of the season. 
He could remain on the roster and not play, or the team could cut him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie Hester, a free-agent acquisition from Indianapolis, is challenging Nate 
Lewis for the second starting wide receiver spot. Hester has caught seven 
passes for 112 yards in three exhibitions, including three for 59 yards 
Saturday against the Raiders, his former team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Sean Gilbert and defensive end Gerald Robinson didn't 
practice because of ankle injuries. Both will sit out the San Diego game. . . . 
Defensive end Fred Stokes, who had been sidelined because of a sprained knee, 
returned to practice Monday for the first time in three weeks. MIKE REILLEY

NET RESULT IS OPPORTUNITY; INNER-CITY YOUTH HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO TENNIS BY 
RICHARD WILLIAMS FOR 25 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG SANDOVAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Williams is hitting tennis balls high into the air with a 9-year-old 
boy when he sees a player on another court hit a shot into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Hamburger," Williams hollers. "Didn't I just get done telling you not to 
hit the ball so flat? Hit the ball into the air -- then give me 20 hoppers." 
</P>
<P>
 To Williams, all young tennis players are "hamburgers." He says the nickname 
fits. If Williams thinks one of his players didn't give enough effort, the 
player is made to do jumping jacks, or "hoppers." 
</P>
<P>
 For the last 25 years, Williams has given tennis lessons to L.A.'s inner-city 
youngsters, enabling them to enter a world that otherwise might be 
unattainable. 
</P>
<P>
 He has taken a sport mostly associated with affluent suburbs and introduced it 
to urban Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 57, operates the California Tennis Assn. for Underprivileged Youth 
with the help of his brother, Fred. The program has gone beyond teaching 
youngsters the fundamentals of tennis. It has produced some of the city's best 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' players have won junior tennis tournaments and have been ranked 
nationally. Three are ranked in the top 10 in their respective age groups by 
the Southern California Tennis Assn. -- LaGeorge Mauldin, 12 and under; 
Demetrix Clemons 14 and under, and Richard's son, Robert, 16 and under. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of William's pupils have succeeded in high school as well. Eight have 
reached the finals of the L.A. City Section individual tournament. Last year, 
Kendra Segura -- no relation to Pancho Segura, a star of the '40s and '50s -- 
won the girls' title as a freshman, and Robert Williams won the boys' title as 
a sophomore at Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dorsey's had some great players and Richard has trained them all," said Dave 
Gordon, Dorsey's tennis coach. "He's meant everything to Dorsey and inner-city 
tennis." 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams is the first to acknowledge that he has never produced a player 
ranked among the top 200 in the world, and he thinks he probably never will. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said most of his kids simply do not have enough money to be 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, every serious player needs four rackets, which cost about $150 
each. Shoes start at $50. Most tennis instructors charge $40-$50 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every player serious about playing tennis at a high level of competition 
takes lessons," said Jim Hillman, director of junior tennis for the SCTA. "I 
know families spending $20,000 a year on a single child to play tennis. Most of 
it goes to lessons." 
</P>
<P>
 Mauldin, the No. 2 player in Southern California in his age group, had to quit 
for three months last year for financial reasons. He started playing again only 
after the ATP Tour, the governing body for the men's professional circuit, 
donated $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to know just how expensive tennis can be to understand what Richard 
has done," Hillman said. "Sending one kid to a tournament can cost $3,000 after 
you pay the entry fees, travel and lodging expenses, and I've seen Richard with 
four or five kids at tournaments. It's my belief a lot of the money comes out 
of his own pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' program survives on an average yearly budget of $9,000, money he 
manages to collect from a variety of sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has received donations from the Santa Monica Tennis Club, actor 
Charlton Heston, beer companies, and City Councilman Nate Holden, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Unknown to Williams at the time, one generous donor was a drug dealer. He gave 
$800 a month for almost a year. The donations stopped when the man was sent to 
prison in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high costs, Williams doesn't scrimp when it comes to his players 
competing in tournaments. Junior tennis tournaments let Williams showcase his 
players' talents. They also are the best way for players to move up in the 
rankings, the basis of a player's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 The main purpose of Williams' program, however, is to get his players into 
tournaments watched by college coaches who can offer athletic scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Brown, director of tennis at Harvard Recreation Center in Los Angeles, 
runs a program similar to Williams'. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard has a lot of kids playing in tournaments and that's why they have the 
most successful program in the area," Brown said. "It's expensive, but Richard 
does it. His players get good exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said 25 of his players have earned athletic scholarships, including 
his oldest son, Richard Williams Jr., 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Although tournaments can be beneficial, competing in them is not always easy 
when the opponents appear to have more advantages. Williams said one of his 
players was embarrassed by the team's poor appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'Son, you are poor. Don't be ashamed of that. It's not your 
fault. You have to show the guy on the other side of the net that his money 
can't buy talent and it can't buy heart,' " Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I push them to keep going because I know what tennis can do. I've seen what 
it did for my son and I know what it did for me." 
</P>
<P>
 An older brother, Walter Williams, inspired Richard to take up tennis at Will 
Rogers Park in Watts, where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter belonged to the University Tennis Club in Los Angeles and sometimes 
brought Richard along to meet some of the more affluent members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the tennis club meetings," Richard said. "My brother and his friends 
were educated and had nice things. They were different than the people I was 
used to hanging around with. I equated tennis with success." 
</P>
<P>
 After earning a tennis scholarship to Pepperdine and spending several years in 
the Army, Williams earned his degree from Cal State Los Angeles in 1968, then 
was a postal worker for 24 years, retiring in 1992. He lives in the Crenshaw 
area with his two sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he has lived in the area all his life, Williams understands how drugs 
and gangs can make concentrating on anything other than survival difficult for 
many of his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the father and brother of one of his best players are in jail 
and that other members of the family are involved in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "That little hamburger is good enough to get a scholarship one day," Williams 
said. "If I can just keep him here. I just try to give them another alternative 
to the craziness that's out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Vinson is one of Williams' success stories. Vinson started when his 
parents bought him a racket and six tennis lessons for his 13th birthday. But 
he was told he was taking up the sport too late to play competitively. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, in 1985, he was the second-best high school player in the 
City Section. The next year he was competing at Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have never gone to college if I didn't play tennis," Vinson said. "I 
might have gone to a junior college but my family couldn't afford sending me to 
a university. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you can say tennis changed my life."

FIXATIONS: FRIENDS POOL THEMSELVES TOGETHER; THESE LEISURE WORLD SWIMMERS HAVE 
TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE 'AQUADETTE FOLLIES' A SUCCESS. BUT THEY CAN ALSO COUNT 
ON EACH OTHER WHEN THEY'RE ON DRY LAND. 'WE SAY IT'S A CLUB, BUT IT'S REALLY 
MORE LIKE A SORORITY,' SAYS THEIR COACH. 
</P>

<P>
 It had been a scorcher of a day, but now beneath a three-quarter moon, a 
breeze was making it downright chilly at poolside, even for those who weren't 
dripping water and tired from exertion.  
</P>
<P>
 Since last year, some official had decided that the lights previously strung 
over Leisure World Pool No. 1 were illegal, and this night there were glitches 
with the new lighting setup, leaving the swimmers in darkness some of the time. 
The underwater speaker similarly was cutting in and out. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Aquadettes seemed to be enacting a mysterious nocturnal water rite 
rather than a glitzy synchronized swimming performance. Yet it is this latter 
prospect they will be presenting in public with "Aquadette Follies 1994" this 
Thursday through Sunday night, as they have done for the past 29 years, drawing 
audiences of up to 1,300 over the four days. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks who have seen the old Esther Williams movies or watched the synchronized 
swimming events in the Olympics have an idea of what the Aquadettes are up to. 
It's like ballet, except you get water up your nose. The swimmers form shapes 
and curls of motion in the water; they invert themselves, with glistening gams 
kicking up above the surface in unison; they, with any luck at all, perform in 
precise yet fluid motion, as each member becomes part of a bigger picture 
framed by time and grid location, all set to music such as "The Third Man" 
theme and a Jimmy Durante rendition of "As Time Goes By."  
</P>
<P>
 The 23 Aquadettes are aged 60 to 82. Some are what Aquadettes president Bev 
Margolis refers to as "bionic women," explaining, "There's this one girl with 
artificial knees, artificial hips and an artificial arm, and she's out there 
swimming. There are people who have had heart surgeries, cancer surgeries, 
mastectomies, back operations, shoulder operations, arms that don't work. The 
average age is about 74."  
</P>
<P>
 And according to fellow Aquadette Bette Ring, "Their attitudes are all 
tremendous. There's not one of the 23 you could spend an afternoon with 
one-to-one where they would give you anything to be depressed over. They're all 
up ." 
</P>
<P>
 Professional synchronized swimmers half-a-century younger might rehearse one 
routine six hours a day for a year. The Aquadettes learned 10 routines this 
year, rehearsing for a couple of hours two or three times a week. And Margolis 
noted, "When you get older you don't process things as fast." 
</P>
<P>
 On this night a week before their debut, it wasn't all serendipity. Swimmers 
would sometimes surface yards from the mark, or once seemed to approximate a 
human log jam. But most of the time it worked, and there was a true, and 
touching, grace to their water dance.  
</P>
<P>
 More than in their sodden ballet, that grace was apparent in their faces, in 
the looks of pleasure and pride that appeared when the swimmers played off one 
another, helping each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "We say it's a club, but it's really more like a sorority," said Aquadettes 
coach Eileen Allen. "It's a wonderful camaraderie. I've belonged to other clubs 
and it has left me cold, because there is this clique here and that there. 
We're kind of cliquey, but it's a big clique." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ring: "They are a very caring, close group. They are the first ones to 
your side if you're in trouble or your husband is ill. If anything happens, one 
of the Aquadettes will be right there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ring, Allen and Margolis agree that the members' bond runs deeper because they 
have to depend on each other in a challenging situation.  
</P>
<P>
 The three are among the seven choreographers of this year's show. It's a job 
they describe as both the most difficult and the most fun, seeing their visions 
brought to life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did have to make a rule, though," Allen said. "We've stopped having it 
where you can choreograph a number and then swim in it. It just didn't work 
because you'd be busy looking around at everybody and making sure they were 
doing the right thing and as a result you'd do the wrong thing. One year my 
son-in-law and daughter were in the audience and he looked at my daughter and 
said, 'Well, either those seven ladies are wrong or mom is.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who turns 80 in November, has coached the Aquadettes for 15 years. 
Prospective members have to be juried in and meet a set of qualifications, 
including being able to do a length of the pool each in the breast stroke, 
crawl, backstroke and sidestroke on both sides. Allen says she's a tough coach. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be. Nobody's meant to love the coach. When I was in college, the 
coach had a bamboo pole to hit you with. I don't go that far," she said. Allen 
choreographed the the biggest number, the show-closing medley from "Camelot," 
which, with 22 swimmers involved, is a true exercise in traffic control.  
</P>
<P>
 Each swimmer has to know where she is in a routine by keeping track of the 
musical beats and measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolis joked: "One of the qualifications of being an Aquadette is you have 
to be able to count from one to eight. If you can do that, you're in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the music comes from movies or show tunes. This year's show includes 
"Music of the Night" from "Phantom of the Opera" and the theme from "Free 
Willy." They've used a John Travolta tune in years past and plan on swimming to 
"My Boyfriend's Back" next year. Some music just doesn't work, though, 
including the shifting rhythms of Glenn Miller.  
</P>
<P>
 Added Allen: "Neil Diamond is one of my favorites, yet it's not steady enough. 
If he decides to hold a note for a while, what's a swimmer going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Those below the surface use the underwater speaker to keep track of the beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The underwater speaker helps," Allen said. "Of course if we had underwater 
hearing aids and underwater glasses, we'd be better off." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aquadettes may approach their work with a sense of humor, but there is no 
denying it is work. It is a long process to learn the vocabulary of 
synchronized dancing, all the moves and interactions. A great many of those 
were learned from Marilyn Thorpe, an "honorary Aquadette" who is swimming a 
solo number in this year's show. Thorpe, 55, has been teaching swimming to 
Leisure World residents since 1978 and has a background in synchronized 
swimming, along with having played a part in its history. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't become an Olympic event until 1984, and that resulted from a 
lobbying effort begun by the United States in 1960. Thorpe was part of that 
effort, one of a 100-member Aquacade that toured Europe that year to promote 
the sport.  
</P>
<P>
 "We gave clinics and exhibitions in various European cities. That was my real 
immersion in synchronized swimming. We swam in heated pools, but we also swam 
in cold, dark lakes and wore heavy, useless costumes. I had one that was made 
of corduroy," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Aquadettes practice in matching floral print swimsuits and perform in 
costumes and hats made by a costume committee. If, with aging, an Aquadette 
finds she's unable to keep up with her responsibilities, she "bows out 
gracefully" Allen said, and instead helps out as an auxiliary member. 
</P>
<P>
 The tickets to their performances go for a $4 donation (for tickets, call 
Shirley McElyea at (714) 830-2321). Some of that goes for costumes, props and 
other expenses, but most is distributed to a number of charitable causes. Most 
of those causes are ones of concern to senior citizens, including cancer, heart 
and Alzheimer's disease groups, but they also have donated to Laguna Hills High 
School to help offset budget cuts there.  
</P>
<P>
 For all the good they do, Allen, Margolis and Ring agree that they and the 
other Aquadettes get more good out of it themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 Margolis said, "I have a love of music and love of swimming, so it's a 
wonderful combination for me." 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing about it for me is health, because I had a bad back 10 years 
ago and it feels so much better now," Ring said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have arthritis and if I don't swim at least three times a week I'm in 
trouble. I get stiff," said Allen, who was recovering from a back operation 
when she moved to Leisure World in the mid-'70s. "For a time I had to use the 
other pool with a wheelchair ramp here, and for a time I could only swim on my 
back. I think doing this keeps you going, and interested. Now, I don't think 
I'm as good as I once was -- I'm going to be 80 in November -- but I manage to 
stay above water." 
</P>
<P>
 They say they always have appreciative audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolis said: "It's always a successful show. People here seem to like it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Because they're amazed we can do it," Allen said.

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; FOUNDERS GO FLORENTINE WITH A FLOURISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 150 guests took an imaginary journey to Florence, Italy, for a night of 
Italian food and music when Founders Plus of the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center staged "A Fling in Firenze." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lemon Heights estate of Ellie Cortese served as a real-life Italian villa 
for the annual founders' gala, with its sweeping views of the surrounding 
hills, an interior adorned with fine art and marble and a towering statue of 
Botticelli's Venus presiding over the pool. The $94-per-person gala was held 
Sunday to honor the founders of the Costa Mesa center. Taste of Italy 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to call this 'An Evening in Rome,' but our committee thought, 
'Oh, how dull.' Then one of the members came up with 'Fling in Firenze,' " said 
event chairwoman Jan Landstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 To create their romantic Firenze, organizers set up tables outdoors on the 
veranda overlooking the pool and adorned each with a clay pot filled with 
sunflowers -- a common sight in Florence. There, guests listened to Sam Juliano 
perform on accordion and soprano Darrellyn Melilli sing two arias by Puccini. 
</P>
<P>
 When the singing stopped, party-goers visited a buffet stocked with Italian 
specialties prepared by Antonello's, including insalata mista (salad with 
sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese), focaccia, penne in vodka-tomato sauce and 
chicken stuffed with ricotta and spinach. For dolci, or dessert, there was 
cioccolatino -- a flourless chocolate cake -- and fruit tarts. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner, guests could dance under the stars to the music of the Sam Conti 
trio or sip coffee drinks from a cappuccino station. Sold on a Dream 
</P>
<P>
 The founders paid tribute to three couples who have played large parts in the 
center's success: Ruth and Lock Gee Ding, Peter and Mary Muth and Ed and Floss 
Schumacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Floss Schumacher recalled how the founders began with a small group of men and 
women who wanted a music center in Orange County in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "From seven (founders) it ballooned to 500 people," she said. Before the 
center was completed, Schumacher would give tours of the building wearing a 
hard hat. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge was getting people to support a center that didn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was very speculative. We didn't know if the money was going down a 
rat hole," joked Ed Schumacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the center was able to drum up enough support to open doors in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "People had faith in it," said Peter Muth. "And they backed up that faith with 
their money and time." 
</P>
<P>
 Founders Plus was formed by those who wanted to carry on the work of the 
original founders and support center services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an offspring of the original founders to serve the underserved," 
Landstrom said. "In the past seven years we've distributed 120,000 tickets to 
people who could not afford to go to the center." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests were: Tom Tomlinson, who thanked the group for welcoming him 
as the center's executive director one year ago ("the fastest year of my 
life"); James Johnson and event co-chairwoman Nora Jorgensen-Johnson, Vesta 
Curry, Betty Belden-Palmer, Harry and Shari Esayian, Jim and Barbara Glabman, 
Tom Moon, Fred and Jean Hamann, Elaine Dysart, Maurice and Marcy Mulville, 
Keith and Barbara Johannes, Bob and Gini Robins and Kent and Carol Wilkens.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Live Entertainment Inc., a Van Nuys videocassette distributor, reported a 
$1.37-million net loss for the second quarter ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 A year earlier, Live lost $1.54 million.Its sales in the recent quarter fell 
17%, to $29.2 million from $35.2 million in the second quarter of 1993. 
</P>

 For the six months, the company lost $4.21 million, while sales declined 27%, 
to $47.4 million. A year before, it had a net loss of $2.27 million on $64.7

FIRM REACHES FOR INFOMERCIAL'S BIG LEAGUES; MARKETING: MIKE LEVEY, WHO HAS 
BECOME A TV PERSONALITY RUNNING POSITIVE RESPONSE, IS USING A $6-MILLION 
INFUSION TO LAUNCH AN AMBITIOUS EXPANSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW HELLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the past five years, Mike Levey has filled television air time across the 
nation, selling everything from car wax to electric juice extractors on 
30-minute infomercials. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs have generated about $20 million in sales for his company, 
Positive Response Television, and in a good year the company makes 30 cents of 
profit for every $1 in sales. Along the way, Levey, its chairman and chief 
executive, has become a TV personality, known for his boyish enthusiasm and 
garish sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that has not put the Sherman Oaks-based company in the big leagues of 
the $1-billion-per-year infomercial business. It has been a small player, 
producing infomercials for other direct marketers, notably Philadelphia-based 
National Media Corp., and earning only a small royalty on sales of the 
products. Last year, Positive Response earned $1.3 million on revenues of $3.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, armed with a $6-million cash infusion from an initial stock offering in 
May, Levey is embarking on an ambitious expansion. His objective is to bring 
every facet of the infomercial business -- from buying products to buying air 
time -- under one roof. That way, instead of just getting a piece of the 
action, Levey hopes to get the whole pie. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have outgrown the need to go to a company like National Media," Levey 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 As with any marketing firm, Positive Response's future depends entirely on the 
serendipity of lining up products that viewers are eager to buy. So far, Levey 
claims that five out of every seven infomercials he has made have been hits. 
And he believes the expansion strategy will cushion the company from the 
effects of any flops. 
</P>
<P>
 But some wonder if Levey will drain the company's cash by building up its 
overhead costs dramatically by now doing everything from buying advertising 
time to running telemarketing staffs to push his products. How will he cope 
with the additional costs, inventory, legal headaches and demands on their 
management skills? 
</P>
<P>
 "They're looking for bigger rewards, but I think they're taking on a much 
bigger risk," said a veteran of the infomercial business, who asked not to be 
identified. "If I were them, I would have looked to produce more shows rather 
than try to broaden their business." 
</P>
<P>
 But Levey, 45, has been working in the infomercial business since 1985, soon 
after the Federal Communications Commission paved the way by freeing TV 
stations and cable networks to sell entire half-hour blocks of air time for 
advertising. Levey got his start producing shows for Twin Star Productions, an 
Arizona firm that long after he left filed for bankruptcy protection in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Levey had left Twin Star to found Positive Response in 1988 out of an office 
above a restaurant in Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
 With Positive Reponse, Levey devised the "Amazing Discoveries" format and 
emerged from behind the camera to host the infomercials on-camera. That way, he 
reasoned, there would be no danger of a host demanding more money or leaving to 
work for a competitor. "I decided the only person I have control over is 
myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The products mostly came from inventors who contacted the company and Levey's 
own scouts. The fast-paced shows were produced for between $150,000 and 
$200,000, including renting a sound stage and building a set. And the shows 
usually worked. Levey's "instincts are perfect," said Rosemary Kavanaugh, chief 
executive of a rival, Agoura Hills-based Infomercial Solutions. "He hauls the 
viewers in long enough to hear the message and close the sale." 
</P>
<P>
 "Positive Response has one of the highest success ratios in the business," 
said John Kogler, publisher of Jordan Whitney Inc.'s TV Direct Response 
Monitoring Report. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Positive Response has made 40 infomercials, and its hit products includes a 
car wax and a natural white tooth polish. One of the few flops was a fire 
extinguisher called Haloflex. "Preventative products do not sell in direct 
response," Levey explained. "The person who buys from direct response wants to 
be able to take home the product and have it better their lives" right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Levey's success, however, has not translated into huge sales. The "Amazing 
Discoveries" shows were produced for National Media, which bought the air time, 
filled the product orders and took on the risk. While Positive Response got a 
royalty payment of 6% to 10% of every unit sold, National Media got the 
windfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 But the relationship soured and Positive Response ended up suing National 
Media in May, 1993, for failing to make royalty payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Positive Response is taking on many of the roles that its partner 
performed. "That's why we did the public offering, so we can do the whole thing 
ourselves," company President Stephen Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the company acquired a media-buying firm that purchases TV slots 
for Positive Response infomercials, as well as for those made by other 
producers. It has also set up a sophisticated telemarketing operation aimed at 
generating "continuity" sales, that is, persuading buyers of previous 
infomercial products to purchase additional items. Those who bought recently 
advertised exercise videos, for instance, will be offered such products as 
treadmills. 
</P>
<P>
 The objective is not only to reap the windfalls but also to soften the impact 
of any flops by maximizing the hits. "The infomercial is just the beginning of 
the selling cycle," Levey said. "What we do is put a show on the air and then 
we figure out ways of getting continuing revenue out of the customer after the 
show is off the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Positive Response's recent results have been mixed. For the first six months 
of this year, the company earned a profit of $336,000 on revenues of $6.5 
million, compared to a profit of $219,000 on sales of $1.3 million in the same 
period a year earlier. The company claims that earthquake damage to its 
headquarters hurt profits this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the stock has risen steadily from the offering price of $6 a share 
to close at $13.125 on Monday. Levey, the company's principal shareholder, now 
owns a 44% stake worth about $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Positive Response is a long way from having the resources of 
infomercial titans such as Guthy-Renker, a Palm Desert-based company in which 
billionaire Ronald Perelman recently invested $25 million, or USA Direct -- a 
unit of Fingerhut Cos., a $1.6-billion direct-mail company in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard West, an analyst with Gaines Berland in New York, endorses 
Positive Response's expansion strategy. "If you look at the royalties they 
received, if they'd done everything themselves, they would have had revenues of 
$267 million," he said. "They realized this is the way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have doubts. Kavanaugh, the infomercial executive, predicted that Levey 
will need to draw on a wider range of expertise to manage additional 
operations. "He has the panache, the instincts and the marketing skills," she 
said. "The key will be having the business management skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Another industry source warned that by taking full responsibility for its 
products and pushing the "continuity" idea, Positive Response will increase its 
exposure to product liability and regulatory problems. "Every public company in 
our business is almost sinking under litigation," that source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Positive Response is already bound by a 1993 consent decree with the Federal 
Trade Commission under which it paid $275,000 in consumer redress, and agreed 
to abide by broad restrictions on its programs. Among other charges, the FTC 
had alleged that Levey made false claims for a food mixer advertised on an 
infomercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Levey says Harvey Saferstein, a Los Angeles attorney and past president of the 
State Bar of California, now attends the taping of every Positive Response 
infomercial to make sure no unsubstantiated claims for the product are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Levey also insists that behind his loud sweaters, there is a savvy and 
experienced businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though you see me take the role of host, I have made much more of a 
contribution to that campaign," he said. "I also negotiated the deal with the 
manufacturer, named the product and did everything else too." 
</P>
<P>
 And according to Levey, the expansion has already had at least one immediate 
benefit: "It's afforded me the ability to get much better sweaters."

WHY BUY A STAFF WHEN YOU CAN LEASE ONE?; LOCAL FIRM CLAIMS LEADERSHIP IN 
FAST-GROWING FIELD HANDLING WORKERS, BUT FACES NEW RIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you work for a small company, Marvin R. Selter, or someone like him, may 
someday be your boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Selter, the CEO of Van Nuys-based National Staff Network, runs one of hundreds 
of firms in the fast-growing business of employee leasing. The idea is simple: 
Rather than wrestle with tax forms and other payroll hassles on their own, 
companies unload their workers to a staff-leasing company, which then leases 
them back for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice has been around for decades, but since the early '80s it's been 
catching on in a big way. The leasing industry has been growing at 30% per year 
recently and currently 1.6 million employees nationwide are working under lease 
agreements, according to the National Assn. of Professional Employer 
Organizations, which represents 230 leasing firms. 
</P>
<P>
 National Staff Network is viewed as a forerunner in the industry, if not quite 
a leader. Selter, 66, a former business consultant in the medical industry, 
began experimenting with employee leasing in the early 1970s, and National 
Staff Network grew out of a company he established in 1972. But today, it faces 
a host of new, large competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Leased workers generally occupy permanent positions. Unlike temporary firms, 
which recruit their own workers and then provide them for temporary positions, 
most leasing companies do not hire their own workers, but rather solicit 
employers to transfer their work forces on paper to a leasing company. 
Executives in both businesses say the two do not compete directly. Temporaries 
are used for vacation replacements and special projects, while leased employees 
are longer-term, and continue to be trained and supervised by the company that 
leases them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 National Staff Network is privately held by Selter, who is notoriously 
secretive about its operations -- he steadfastly refuses to discuss the 
company's revenues or earnings. He contends he created the concept of leasing, 
a claim that others in the industry contest. 
</P>
<P>
 National Staff Network's leased staff includes workers in 26 states, with many 
in the insurance, medical and real estate fields, Selter said. About half are 
clerical workers. The others are professional or blue collar. He said their 
salaries range from $16,000 per year to over $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Selter contends that National Staff Network is one of the top five 
staff-leasing companies in the country, another claim that elicits skepticism 
from competitors. "I really don't think they are that large. . . . We all keep 
track of each other," said Buddy LeTourneau, CEO of Staff Leasing Group in 
Bradenton, Fla. Selter also claims his company has grown steadily. The number 
of leased workers in its employ shot up 22% last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like most staff-leasing firms, typical customers of National Staff Network are 
firms with only five to 15 employees, although the company serves clients with 
up to 200 employees, Selter said. 
</P>
<P>
 For small firms, staff leasing offers freedom from burdensome paperwork, and 
better economies of scale when it comes to obtaining benefits for their 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Negotiating a good health insurance plan is very time-consuming and very 
costly," said Millie Courtway, partner in Unitco Management Co., a Sherman Oaks 
property-management firm. "The bigger you are, the better package you can get." 
</P>
<P>
 Courtway's firm has leased all 10 of its office employees from National Staff 
Network since 1987. Leasing meant the employees could get better benefits, she 
said. Although the office staff had health benefits before, they did not have 
retirement plans. Now they do. 
</P>
<P>
 And Courtway says her own job is simpler. Rather than deal with payroll on her 
own, she simply writes periodic checks to National Staff Network. Moreover, 
when one employee appeared to have a drug problem, Courtway had somewhere to 
turn. National Staff Network provided counseling. "It made it easy for me," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtway said doing her own payroll, taxes, insurance and benefits cost her 
50% over the cost of the salaries she was paying out. With leasing, the excess 
cost is about 30%, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leasing advocates such as Selter say that leasing also promises a better world 
for employees. A leased employee may have access to big-business services that 
are often denied to workers in small businesses, such as direct deposit, 401(k) 
retirement plans and life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Tawny Wattles, a leased employee and bookkeeper at Unitco, said that at first 
being leased "felt awkward." But she said she likes the benefits, and finds 
other aspects of her job identical to being employed directly. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's also the case that many leased employees are provided with bare-bones 
packages hardly better than those typically provided to temporary workers. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40% of the leased employees of National Staff Network, the company 
concedes, have no health benefits included in their compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida's Staff Leasing Group, one of the nation's largest employee-leasing 
concerns, offers health benefits as part of its compensation to only about a 
quarter of its 43,000 leased employees, according to CEO LeTourneau. 
</P>
<P>
 One National Staff Network employee who does not have health benefits remarked 
that, in that sense, being a temp is better than being leased, since temporary 
workers at least have the hope of someday being hired permanently, and with 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Many employee-leasing companies say they are moving toward providing more 
extensive benefits and services to remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 This trend has favored bigger companies, and a host of consolidations are now 
afoot. Notable are efforts by large temporary-employment companies to expand 
into leasing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in January, temp giant Kelly Services Inc., based in Troy, 
Mich., acquired Woodland Hills-based Your Staff Inc., a leasing firm that 
claims to be among the state's largest, with about 5,500 employees. Kelly's aim 
is to expand into the employee-leasing business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small (leasing) firms are going to have to merge and grow. They can't make it 
on their own," said Patty Bradberry, director of the Orange-based leasing firm 
Shaw & Shaw Inc. Shaw & Shaw is a newly created subsidiary of Volt Information 
Sciences Inc., a half-billion-dollar company in the directory-publishing and 
temporary-employment businesses, which now hopes to expand into employee 
leasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Where all this leaves National Staff Network is hard to say, since so little 
is known about its size. Staff Leasing Group's LeTourneau said he doubts 
whether National Staff Network's work force numbers more than a few thousand. 
</P>
<P>
 He also questioned its competitiveness, noting that many firms in the industry 
are growing at rates of 30% to 50%, much faster than the 22% National Staff 
Network said it grew last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Selter retorts that he's selective about his clients, and added that Staff 
Leasing Group is probably inflating its own numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Employee-leasing entrepreneurs are endlessly quarrelsome on the 
earth-shattering questions of who's biggest, who really invented employee 
leasing and who founded the first industry organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Selter is a respected figure, but because of his secrecy and the pains he 
takes to distance himself from others in the industry, he's viewed as a bit of 
a renegade, said T. Joe Willey, a San Bernardino industry consultant who has 
written books on leasing. "I don't trust anything they (National Staff Network) 
say," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry must also contend with laws in 12 states that regulate employee 
leasing, including Florida, which goes so far as to fingerprint 
employee-leasing firm executives. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Selter rails against so-called "blue-suede shoe" companies whose 
lax ethics have given employee leasing a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
 He says it's the reason for his secrecy and aloofness from the masses of 
employee-leasing companies. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't want to compete with firms that make false claims and doesn't even 
belong to the main industry association, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I created this industry. I believe in this industry," he declared. "If people 
only would be honest . . . it could go through the roof."

PROPERTY VALUES: INFORMATION OR BIAS?: ADS SET OFF FAIR-HOUSING ALARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How would you like to buy an executive house in a quiet , desirable , 
sophisticated neighborhood? It's in a tranquil setting , near a country club 
and in an area that's prestigious and near churche s and temples and an 
elementary school . 
</P>
<P>
 This sure sounds good to me, but guess again. Most of these descriptive words 
are actually considered "cautionary" or "unacceptable" by the Fair Housing 
Council of the San Fernando Valley in Panorama City. Indeed, according to 
federal regulations even exclusive and private are catch words that should be 
avoided when describing properties for sale. But as is the case with many 
federal regulations, nobody seems to know exactly what this means. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted that housing bias based on race, sex, age and family status is clearly 
illegal. Many people in the real estate industry are wondering, though, whether 
putting such terms as tranquil setting on a list of phrases to avoid really 
helps eradicate the scourge of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you or your real estate agent advertise your property for rent or sale, 
you can't discriminate," said Diana Bruno, executive director of the local Fair 
Housing Council, a nonprofit group that investigates alleged housing 
discrimination. Terms like sophisticated or prestigious aren't necessarily 
discriminatory, Bruno said, but they might be if used in a certain context. She 
and other anti-discrimination advocates are fighting hard to exclude a growing 
list of terms from real estate ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruno is also part of a group called the Fair Housing Advertising Task Force, 
a local group of advocates, home builders and other business people who are 
working to make real estate ads more multicultural. When builders advertise new 
homes with photos of people, she said, "they must advertise all sorts of people 
-- people in wheelchairs, people of color, different nationalities, etc." 
</P>
<P>
 But advertising an apartment building as a "quiet professional building" is a 
gray area, Bruno said. That ad could be interpreted as suggesting that only 
professionals who have no kids are wanted. Another faux pas is advertising a 
home within walking distance to a church or temple. This, she said, could 
connote that the seller or landlord only wants a buyer or a tenant who attends 
church or synagogue services. 
</P>
<P>
 These kinds of words and terms are being increasingly edited out by classified 
departments at local newspapers, which "seems to me an extreme, ridiculous kind 
of thing," said Steven Sokol, associate general counsel for the California 
Assn. of Realtors (CAR). "This is sort of like walking though mush. You can't 
really put your finger on all the ways someone might construe a particular 
term." 
</P>
<P>
 There is still discrimination in housing that needs to be remedied, Sokol 
said. As a result, "society is edging forward in trying to figure what 
constitutes discrimination versus information that buyers ought to be able to 
get access to." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the CAR doesn't really monitor real estate ads, Sokol conceded. But 
CAR rules and various other rules and statutes do forbid false and misleading 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all a matter of relativity," said Steve Ellis, Los Angeles district 
office manager for the California Department of Real Estate. "We don't have a 
specific law that says you can't use this word or that word. You start getting 
into semantics and it's pretty difficult to regulate. We don't try and become 
overbearing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You shouldn't discriminate. But I don't know what's wrong with saying a home 
is two blocks from the church and temple. I would think the purchaser would 
want to know that," Ellis said. "In general we don't have very specific 
limitations in what to put in an ad." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis said he regularly gets calls from classified advertising representatives 
at various local newspapers asking whether the Department of Real Estate would 
object to the use of certain words or phrases. Mostly, the state agency is 
concerned about false and misleading advertising instead of potentially 
offensive ads. "We hardly ever go after our licensees for their ads," Ellis 
conceded.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: TALKS HALTED ON SALE OF VENTURA BANK SUBSIDIARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County National Bancorp announced that negotiations for the sale of 
its Frontier Bank subsidiary to Peninsula National Bank have been halted 
because the companies could not agree on a price. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontier Bank, headquartered in La Palma, reported total assets of $96 million 
on June 30 and for the first six months of 1994 reported net income of 
$434,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County National Bancorp, which is also the parent of Ventura County 
National Bank, has been plagued by bad loans and is under the gun by federal 
regulators to raise certain ratios that measure equity as a percentage of 
risk-based assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to meet the federal requirements by Sept. 30 could lead to sanctions, 
possibly including removal of personnel, against the Oxnard-based bank.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: A. LEVY BANK RIVALS AIM TO CAPITALIZE ON HOMETOWN TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's less than a month since First Interstate Bancorp, the Los Angeles-based 
parent of First Interstate Bank, announced plans to acquire the venerable Bank 
of A. Levy. But two of Levy's small banking rivals are already battling for 
parts of the business that belonged to Ventura County's largest independent 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "A big chain bank has swallowed another one of Ventura County's local 
institutions," laments an advertisement run in local newspapers by 
Ventura-based American Commercial Bank. "For those who value personal 
relationships and community banking, this is a sad trend and we're sorry to see 
them go. 
</P>
<P>
 "But personal banking is still alive and well at ACB . . . Come Home To ACB." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad features a picture of some of American's top people, noting how long 
each has worked for the three-office bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Beeninga, American's president and chief executive, says several A. Levy 
customers, including business people, have already switched to American in the 
short time since the merger was announced. "They've told us they'd rather do 
business with us because we're locally owned and independent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they won't be disappointed. Our loan officers and managers are 
authorized to make loans on the spot. Sometimes they come to a decision in as 
little as five minutes. And we make a point of knowing people's names." 
</P>
<P>
 Beeninga, incidentally, says American has no intention of following A. Levy's 
lead and being acquired by one of the giants. "We feel we have a role to play, 
making loans as small as $50,000 to local businesses. We have mixed feelings 
about losing a top competitor, but we're going to continue just as we have in 
the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Another ad, from Oxnard-based Channel Islands National Bank, is headlined 
"Farewell, Old Friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that things won't be the same without Bank of A. Levy around, Channel 
Islands suggests: "You may be one of their loyal customers who feels that 
banking with a locally owned and managed financial institution is still 
important. . . . So give us a call and we'll do everything we can to make this 
transition easier for you. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our way of saying thanks for keeping your funds working here and 
believing that local banking is important." 
</P>
<P>
 The message, signed by Channel Islands Chairman Stan Cohen and Chief Executive 
Chuck Elliott, offers former A. Levy customers a free order of checks, an ATM 
card and an endorsement stamp for business accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days after the ad started running, Elliott said he wasn't sure whether 
it had attracted new accounts. "But our lending officers tell me they've been 
successful in setting up appointments with business people who currently deal 
with Bank of A. Levy," he said. "We're hopeful that quite a few of these people 
will see the advantages of dealing with a local lender." 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, Channel Islands announced last week that Elliott will leave next 
month because he had philosophical differences with the bank's directors. 
Elliott wanted the bank to concentrate on serving businesses and professional 
customers, while the bank said it wants to serve businesses, but it also wants 
to concentrate on individual consumers too. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Bank of A. Levy's agreed-upon new parent isn't sitting on the 
sidelines while local independents go after Levy's business. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate is running an ad itself, pointing out that between them, 
First Interstate and Bank of A. Levy have assets of almost $1 billion in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In an open letter signed by Bruce G. Willison, president of First Interstate, 
and Marshall Milligan, president of Bank of A. Levy, Interstate promises to 
build "on the legacy of Achille Levy and his family to become the kind of 'big 
community bank' we believe he would have envisioned for the Ventura County of 
the 21st Century."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: VENTURA COUNTY HOMES 7TH LEAST AFFORDABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County is one of the least affordable housing markets in California 
even though it's easier for the average family to own a home in the county 
today than it was three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, mortgage payments in the county amount to more than 42% of a 
family's monthly income, according to TRW REDI Property Data. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is based on an average home mortgage of $175,375 in this year's 
first half. That makes Ventura County homes the seventh least affordable in the 
state, reports TRW market analyst Nima Nattagh. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, when mortgages in the county averaged $178,106, monthly payments 
equaled almost 52% of the average family income, the study showed. "Since 
mortgages were a little larger and wages were lower then, housing was less 
affordable than it is now," Nattagh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though mortgage interest rates have risen recently, they're still lower 
than they were in 1991, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco is the state's least affordable housing market, with mortgage 
payments averaging 54% of families' monthly income, Nattagh said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report, TRW REDI projects an 11% increase in sales of all homes 
in the Oxnard-Ventura market in 1994 over 1993. Sales of new homes should rise 
more than 27%, according to the projection.

 The Charley Brown's restaurant on Seaward Avenue in Ventura has closed, 
reportedly due to declining business. It will be replaced by Golden China, 
which will move from another Seaward location several blocks away."We hope to 
open sometime in October," says Lory Cheng, co-owner of Golden China with her 
husband, Gary Cheng. Officials at Family Restaurants Inc., operator of Charley 
Brown's, weren't available for comment. . . . Larry G. Bumgardner, former 
associate vice chancellor at Pepperdine University, was named deputy director 
of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. He'll also be finance director, 
heading a $20-million fund-raising drive for the Reagan Presidential Library 
and Museum in Simi Valley. . . . Rear Adm. Dana B. McKinney, commander of the 
Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station, told 200 base employees not to panic over 
rumors that Mugu and the Navy's Seabee base at Port Hueneme may be closed. "At 
this point, 'We don't know' is the best answer we can provide," he said. But he 
and other Navy brass declined to answer workers' questions.

SOUTHWEST READIES FOR UNITED'S SHUTTLE; SOUTHWEST AIRLINES, WITH EFFICIENT,

ITS NEW SHUTTLE WILL REGAIN LOST BUSINESS.

 At 11:40 a.m., Southwest Airlines' Flight 1737 from Phoenix wheels up to a 
gate at Burbank Airport, 30 minutes behind schedule. Southwest normally sticks 
to a tight 20-minute time limit for a plane to remain at a gate between 
flights. But since this plane is late, Southwest crews are aiming for a 
herculean 10-minute turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 As the plane taxis in, a dozen workers rush toward it, including some from 
other Southwest crews who are pitching in while their own gates are idle. One 
worker chocks the tires to keep the plane from rolling. Another cleans the 
lavatory. Another crew member pumps fuel, while two others pull up with carts 
bearing luggage and mail. 
</P>
<P>
 In five minutes, passengers are off the plane and the three flight attendants 
-- along with the pilot and first officer -- have picked up all the trash in 
the cabin and put seat belts back in position. 
</P>
<P>
 The 119 new passengers board the plane by stairs at the front and rear of the 
plane. Because there is no first class or assigned seating, passengers grab 
seats on a first-come basis. The doors are closed, the stairs yanked away and 
the plane rolls back from the gate, bound for Oakland. The time: 11:50 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a quick turn," said Southwest operations agent Art Reyes. "I've done 
quicker. My fastest is eight minutes." 
</P>

 This hurry-up work attitude is what many attribute for Dallas-based 
Southwest's stunning success. It has been the only consistently profitable 
airline this decade. Since it debuted at Burbank in 1990, Southwest has knocked 
out competing airlines with its cheap, short-haul flights, and gained a 
two-thirds market share there. And statewide, Southwest commands half the 
intra-California air travel market. 
</P>
<P>
 But champions are bound to be challenged, and the latest test for Southwest 
comes from United Airlines, the nation's largest airline. Last month, United -- 
after selling 55% of the company to employees in exchange for $4.9 billion in 
wage and work-rule concessions -- announced that its Shuttle by United service 
would offer cut-rate, short-haul flights from 14 Western cities beginning Oct. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank is one launching pad for United's Shuttle. It will initially run 10 
flights a day from Burbank to San Francisco for $49 one way in coach with 
advance purchase, and $104 for a walk-up coach fare. In November, another San 
Francisco flight will be added, plus seven daily departures to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Southwest's fares on its 13 daily flights from Burbank to 
Oakland run from $49 for a one-way advance purchase ticket to $69 at the gate. 
Southwest also flies from Burbank to San Jose, Sacramento, Phoenix and Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In a business littered with dead airlines, last year Southwest earned $154 
million on revenue of $2.3 billion. Meanwhile, United's parent, UAL, lost $50 
million on $14.5 billion in sales in 1993. The year before, it lost nearly $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to Southwest's success is efficiency: Its costs average a rock-bottom 
7.2 cents per available seat mile -- or how much it costs to fly one passenger 
one mile. United has said it is aiming for 7.4 cents per available seat mile on 
its shuttle, a far cry from the hefty 9.7 cents average on United flights 
currently. 
</P>
<P>
 Some airline observers bluntly dismiss United's plan. United Shuttle has "not 
a chance in the world" against Southwest, said Gruntal & Co. analyst Steven 
Lewins in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewins blasted United's "macho desire to recover ground lost" in California. 
And he scoffed at the shuttle's goal of 7.4 cents per available seat mile. 
"They might not make it to 8 cents," he said. "They'll get their nose bloodied, 
lose a lot of money and put their planes somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, United's Shuttle is gunning for the heart of Southwest's 
California franchise. In 1991, United's market share at Burbank Airport was 
25%. Now it has a 14% market share, while Southwest's is 65%, according to 
Burbank Airport officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other airlines flying out of Burbank have market shares of just 2% to 6%, 
and some airlines such as USAir have quit flying out of Burbank altogether. Yet 
United's goal is not to destroy Southwest, but to regain the California 
business United has lost to Southwest. "We feel there's enough room for both 
competitors," said United spokesman Tony Molinaro. 
</P>
<P>
 John Thomas, Southwest's station manager at Burbank, wondered how the United 
Shuttle can rival Southwest's efficiency and low costs when it plans to keep 
such features as assigned seating and first-class service. "I imagine sooner or 
later, someone's going to come along and get it right. But we'll just get 
stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are also skeptical. The United Shuttle is "unlikely" to achieve the 
efficiencies necessary to make it profitable, in part because of the 
strangeness of operating one airline with a different style, inside a larger, 
entrenched airline, said analyst Rose Anne Tortora at Donaldson, Lufkin & 
Jenrette Securities in New York. "It's been tried before -- an airline within 
an airline -- unsuccessfully." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Thomas Greer, Burbank Airport's executive director, who welcomes new 
competition and the increased passenger traffic it could bring, is cautious. "I 
don't want to be seen as a skeptic" about United's chances, Greer said. "I am 
saying it is going to be a very difficult task." 
</P>
<P>
 How does Southwest manage to operate so efficiently? 
</P>
<P>
 Besides no meals -- just bags of peanuts and soft drinks -- and no assigned 
seats, Southwest employs timesaving tricks such as reusable plastic boarding 
passes, bigger baggage carts and faster-moving conveyor belts for loading bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's quick turnarounds are necessary for the airline to be so 
profitable, because the longer a plane is in the air, the more money it makes. 
Not surprisingly, Southwest's planes log more hours in the air each day than 
the industry average. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest also keeps costs low by using a fleet of only one kind of plane, 
Boeing 737s, and on average these planes are a relatively young seven years 
old. That reduces operating expenses by eliminating the need for extra 
equipment and training mechanics to handle other types of planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at Southwest are paid about the same as those at other airlines, 
Southwest says. But its overall employee costs are kept low because it uses 
smaller crews on planes and at airports. Those crews simply work faster and 
more efficiently, Southwest says. And they give employees more flexibility than 
most other airlines to help out when planes are running behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Always looking for new ways to streamline, Southwest is now testing a 
ticketless system like those used by hotels and car rental agencies. A customer 
would make a reservation, get a confirmation number and check in at the gate. 
It would replace the ticket system used by airlines that many regard as archaic 
and inefficient. And it would alleviate concerns over the recent dumping of 
Southwest from several reservation systems used by travel agents to book 
tickets -- although Southwest says this has not hurt its business so far. 
</P>
<P>
 But Southwest employees say the real key to the airline's success is the 
corporate culture, a blend of cheerful informality and hustle, that allows them 
to operate with crews half the size of some competing airlines. Workers pitch 
in where needed and enjoy rotating to different assignments -- handling baggage 
one day, emptying lavatories the next. "We just kind of help each other," said 
Jose Luis Aguilar, a Burbank ground crew worker. "If I saw the other guys were 
running behind, I would help out." 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude extends even to Southwest's pilots, who routinely help flight 
attendants clean the interior of the plane between flights. "We do that all the 
time," said Capt. Larry Elliott. Asked if he picked up trash when he worked for 
other airlines, such as Frontier, Elliott laughed and shook his head. "At a lot 
of airlines, pilots don't even see the flight attendants." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rushed turnarounds, a sense of humor -- inspired by Southwest 
Chairman Herb Kelleher -- pervades the airline. When a few passengers straggled 
at the gate minutes before a Southwest flight departed from Burbank recently, 
the operations agent waved her arms and sang in an operatic voice, "Hurry up!" 
</P>
<P>
 United, on the other hand, is known for a starched-shirt formality, although 
some observers expect changes now that the workers control the company. United 
employs "a lot of hard-working, dedicated people," said company spokesman 
Molinaro. Without the salary cuts and new work rules, "we couldn't do the 
shuttle." Indeed, last week United announced plans to hire or recall about 
1,700 workers nationwide by year's end, some of whom might staff the new 
shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the United Shuttle will not have meal service, seats will be 
assigned. But it plans to use a novel boarding process, in which passengers 
with window seats will board first, followed by other passengers. The method is 
being tested at some airports, including Burbank, and United hopes it will 
speed boarding by keeping aisles clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Other United Shuttle techniques will include loading enough ice and snacks on 
a plane in the morning to last all day. Pilots and flight attendants will also 
stay with a plane all day, instead of changing planes as other United crews 
often do. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle will have "dedicated" groups of employees at gates and ramps who 
will work together continuously, thus improving efficiency, Molinaro said. 
Another United spokesman, John Kiker, said the shuttle will probably have more 
flexible work rules and will cross-train workers the way Southwest does -- 
although that still has to be ironed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Molinaro added that Burbank Airport is likely to be an early success because 
many of the shuttle methods are already in place. United's Burbank general 
manager John Spach said that many planes at the airport are already being 
turned around in 16 to 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 United also believes that many customers will favor the shuttle because they 
can earn mileage on United's frequent-flier program, which can be used toward 
long-haul and overseas flights, while Southwest's frequent fliers can only earn 
free tickets for shorter flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts warn, however, that Southwest won't sit still in face of the new 
competition. Linda Rutherford, a Southwest spokeswoman, declined to say if 
Southwest is considering fare cuts or other responses. But she did say that it 
is studying long-haul routes in United-dominated markets with "weak service and 
high prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a counterstrike could prove costly to United, said analyst Lewin, given 
that Southwest "is giving United a pasting" in markets where they now compete.

 In its seven weeks of release "Forrest Gump," starring Tom Hanks, has been in 
and out of the No.1 spot three times. This weekend was one of those, as the 
popular movie replaced "Clear and Present Danger" as the nation's highest 
grossing movie.Both films are Paramount Pictures releases. The studio wasn't so 
lucky with its new family movie "Andre," which came in 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other new films did not fare well. Hollywood Pictures' "Color of Night," 
starring Bruce Willis, managed only a so-so $6.6-million opening weekend, while 
Columbia Pictures' "Blankman" with Damon Wayans did a dismal $3.7 million to 
plop down in 11th place. 04,33,18,10,10 Weekend Gross/ Screens/ Weeks in Movie
