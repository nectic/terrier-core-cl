U.S., CUBA TALKS SHOW NO GAINS; MIGRATION: OPENING ROUND PROCEEDS 'WITHOUT 
HOSTILITY.' AMERICANS AGAIN REJECT CUBAN CONTENTION THAT LIFTING TRADE EMBARGO 
IS THE ONLY LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO REFUGEE PROBLEM.

<P>
 Cuban and American diplomats, while laying aside any obvious hostile feelings, 
remained far apart after the opening round of talks Thursday aimed at working 
out an agreement for halting the relentless waves of Cuban rafters seeking an 
American haven. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a long way to go before having an agreement and a long way to 
go to solving the problem," said Ricardo Alarcon, head of the Cuban delegation. 
Neither side had expected to reach agreement on the first day. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman David Johnson described the talks, which continue 
today, as "serious, professional and businesslike." This diplomatic jargon, 
another U.S. official explained, meant that the talks moved with efficiency and 
"without hostility." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon described the opening session as "businesslike and proper."  
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the few comments made to the press and television, the two sides 
were not far apart on the immediate issue of what needs to be done right now 
about the thousands of Cubans fleeing their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Americans still refused to accept the Cuban contention that the root 
of the problem lies with the American embargo on trade and that no long-term 
solution is possible without dealing with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I speak, I can assure you, I bring up the embargo . . . " Alarcon, 
former Cuban foreign minister and United Nations ambassador, told Cable News 
Network. "By making life more difficult for people down there, you are 
encouraging people to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 But Michael Skol, the deputy assistant secretary of state who leads the 
American negotiators, told reporters as he entered the headquarters of the U.S. 
Mission to the United Nations that he intends to talk only about ending the 
"chaotic, dangerous, unsafe migration north from Cuba on the waters." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about delving into wider issues, Skol held up a large binder and said: 
"I've got a briefing book here, and it is on migration issues only. There's 
nothing here about embargo, about economics, or about anything else. Tabs A 
through M: all migration." 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides have similar views on migration itself. Skol said that it is in 
the interests of both countries "to establish a firm system of legal, safe, 
orderly migration from Cuba." Clinton Administration officials have said that 
they are prepared to offer a guarantee of visas for more than 20,000 Cubans a 
year if Fidel Castro's government stops the exodus of rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said that the United States should grant more visas to Cubans so they 
can leave Cuba by plane instead of by makeshift rafts. Under an agreement 
reached between Castro and the Ronald Reagan Administration 10 years ago, the 
United States has the authority to issue 27,845 visas a year to Cubans. But, 
despite long waiting lists, the U.S. consular office in Havana actually grants 
only about 3,000 visas a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden exodus has embarrassed President Clinton, who -- in an attempt to 
stop the tide -- revoked the 35-year-old policy of admitting all Cuban rafters 
legally as special political refugees. Coast Guardsmen are instead rounding 
them up at sea and detaining them in camps at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base on 
the southeast shore of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. officials insist that the detained Cubans, like the Haitians in 
Guantanamo camps, will not be allowed to enter the United States, the Cuban 
rafters still keep coming. More than 2,000 were picked up by the Coast Guard 
Wednesday, and Coast Guard officials said that a total of 1,484 rafters had 
been plucked from the Florida Straits by 6 p.m. EST Thursday. According to the 
Pentagon, there were 15,471 Cubans and 14,148 Haitians in Guantanamo as of 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The President has assured Cuban exile leaders in Miami that U.S. officials 
will not discuss the embargo at the talks in New York. But this stance has been 
criticized by those who believe that increased ties with Cuba will do more to 
bring down Castro than economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The insistence on limiting the talks to matters of immigration drew a firm 
dissent from Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would certainly try to see that the negotiations are expanded beyond the 
narrow question of migration," Hamilton told the Fox Morning News Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of experience with moving Communist countries toward 
freedom," Hamilton said. "I think we know something about how to do that. And 
the key is engagement. The key is dialogue, discussion, ideas, information, 
letting journalists go in, letting scholars and athletes go in -- open up that 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Johnson said that the talks at the U.S. mission, 
which included a working lunch, lasted for six hours, and would move a few 
blocks away today to the offices of the Cuban mission to the United Nations. 
According to Johnson, the two sides used most of the time for detailed 
presentations of their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Skol discussed legal immigration, police enforcement of illegal 
immigration and the return to Cuba of certain undesirable immigrants. During 
the large exodus from the Cuban port of Mariel in 1980, Castro loosed a number 
of prison and mental hospital inmates, and the United States has long demanded 
that he take them back. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been hints that some inmates may be among the rafters as well. In 
Washington, Pentagon spokesman Dennis R. Boxx said that the U.S. government has 
evidence that some prison inmates were among the Cuban refugees who have been 
taken to Guantanamo, although the number is far less than during the Mariel 
boat lift of 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence we have is partly based on what they tell us," Boxx said. "We 
have other indications that some were more serious offenders because they have 
tattoos -- that is standard procedure in Cuban prisons for offenders. . . . 
Right now we don't see that the numbers are very large. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is something we're concerned about, it is something that we're watching 
and I believe it will also be a topic of discussion at the talks in New York 
today," he went on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, a Washington-based nonprofit organization devoted to 
immigration reform said that it plans to file a civil lawsuit challenging any 
proposals by the Administration to raise the ceiling on the number of Cubans 
allowed admittance to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration 
Reform, said that any such offers to Cuban negotiators would be "illegal and 
outside the framework of U.S. immigration law" because they would flout 
numerical limits established by Congress.

LIFE OF VIOLENCE CATCHES UP TO SUSPECTED MURDERER, 11; CRIME: CHICAGO OFFICIALS 
BELIEVE THAT ROBERT SANDIFER WAS EXECUTED BY HIS GANG AFTER HE KILLED A 
TEEN-AGE GIRL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a city that, like Los Angeles, is so often numbed by the exploits of 
ruthless gang murderers, the saga of Robert Sandifer was sadly familiar -- 
except for his tender age. 
</P>
<P>
 The object of a three-day police hunt, Robert was the suspect in the shooting 
death of one teen-ager and the wounding of two others. He was found early 
Thursday, a murder victim himself. His body lay face down under a viaduct, shot 
in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Sandifer was 11 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sought for the slaying Sunday of Shavon Dean, 14, who was struck by a 
bullet apparently meant for a member of a gang. She wanted to be a beautician 
and had slipped out of her house that night, despite her mother's urgings that 
she stay inside, to visit a candy store and practice her skills on a neighbor's 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert was nicknamed "Yummy" for his love of cookies, and he stood less than 
five feet tall. He was also a member of the Black Disciples, a street gang 
whose ranks number in the hundreds and are alleged to be involved in the drug 
trade, car thefts, extortion, prostitution and credit card fraud. Police 
theorize that his own gang, seeing him as a liability, executed him. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a "tough shorty," the name gang members here give to their baby-faced 
members. His personal rap sheet listed eight arrests in connection with crimes 
ranging from armed robbery to auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois children's services authorities were searching for a facility for him 
outside the state after 13 local agencies turned him down because of his age. 
Robert, said Cook County Public Guardian Patrick Murphy, "was in trouble from 
the moment he was conceived. His family made him a sociopath." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert came from a disturbing background, but, Murphy added, it was far from 
unique. "Believe me," he said, "we see this 100 times a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the most recent FBI statistics show, 267 children under the age of 
14 were charged with murder in 1992, up 50% from the decade before. "It's not a 
diminishing problem. It's going to get worse," said George Knox, director of 
the National Gang Crime Research Center at Chicago State University. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert was the second of seven siblings. When he was 3, the state took Robert, 
who was covered with cigarette burns and bruises that appeared to be caused by 
an extension cord, out of his mother's custody. He was turned over to his 
grandmother, who raised him with little discipline in the house that at various 
times contained as many as 19 other children, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this child was protected five years ago, you save two people," Mayor 
Richard M. Daley said on Wednesday, before Robert's corpse was located. "You 
save the young woman who was killed and you save the young offender." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two children lived a block apart in the Roseland section on the far South 
Side and had what one relative called "a hi-bye relationship." On Thursday, 
neighbors drifted back and forth between their homes, where makeshift shrines 
to each had been fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love you, Shavon," a cousin had scrawled on a banner hanging from a cyclone 
fence at the dead girl's frame house. "Heaven is the place for angels like 
you." Bouquets of sunflowers and carnations were already wilting. On the 
sidewalk, candles burned inside rose-tinted vases. 
</P>
<P>
 At Robert's house, five boys stepped up to write their names with a blue 
marker on a piece of cardboard affixed to the wrought-iron railing of a porch 
where his grandmother, Janet, was sitting. She leaped out of her chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why'd y'all let my baby go like that?" she bellowed at them. "Why'd y'all 
leave Yummy shot?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mute, jaws grinding beneath clamped teeth, they finished signing. Then they 
retreated down the alley while two men grabbed the distraught grandmother 
tightly around her arms and forced her inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robert's no symbol," said his aunt, Bay Sandifer. "They'll probably be 
shooting tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 There was certainly shooting on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon, a 16-year-old gang member was shot with a 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic handgun. Robert was wanted for questioning in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:30 p.m., the same weapon was firing away at a group of teen-agers playing 
football; police say they may have also been gang members. Another 16-year-old 
boy was wounded in the leg and Shavon Dean, who had sneaked away from home 
minutes before, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just looking at Robert's file, Murphy said, he could have predicted "it was 
only a matter of time before he would be dead or killed someone. It just 
happened sooner, not later." 
</P>
<P>
 The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services first made contact 
with Robert's mother in 1984, when he was not yet a year old. The situation was 
investigated again in 1985 and 1986 before five children were removed from the 
home because of "inadequate supervision and a risk of harm," said department 
spokeswoman Martha Allen. Robert's mother, Murphy said, was addicted to crack 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "As time passed," Allen said, "it became apparent to us that the grandmother 
was not supervising the children adequately either." 
</P>
<P>
 His first arrest, at age 8, was for shoplifting. Then, in rapid succession, 
came arrests for criminal damage to property, robbery, attempted armed robbery. 
He bragged about his standing in the Black Disciples. 
</P>
<P>
 He and an older brother ran away from their grandmother's home frequently. 
Late last year, they were made wards of the state. Robert was placed in a 
diagnostic center for evaluation. He got into a fight with a teacher there, and 
ran away in March. 
</P>
<P>
 He was picked up in April in a stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities placed him in a juvenile-detention center. Shortly after his 
release in July, he was tormenting the neighborhood again. Eli Roberts, 17, 
said "Yummy" smashed a window in his white Oldsmobile 88. He retaliated by 
heaving the younger boy's dirt bike into the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days later, "Yummy" grabbed a gasoline can from the back seat of the 
Olds, poured it over the seats and lit a match. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took off, like he always does when he knows he's in trouble," Eli Roberts 
said. "We didn't see him 'round here for a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks, Juvenile Court Judge Thomas R. Sumner ordered the state to find 
a home for Robert outside the Illinois boundary. In the meantime, he decided 
over the state's objection, to return Robert to his grandmother's care. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the month, Robert had been arrested twice more -- for burglary 
and for armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the spate of shootingsfor which Robert was in turn killed by his 
own, police speculate. 
</P>
<P>
 "These organizations are very selfish," said Police Supt. Matt Rodriguez at a 
press conference. "And he was a perfect example of someone who was apparently 
doing the bidding of gangs and is dead because he was expendable." Authorities 
are pursuing what they call "good leads" and say they think they know where 
Robert was during the days he dropped from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shavon Dean's mother, Debra, took no comfort in the fate of the alleged 
murderer. "I'm just sorry it happened to the boy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As she spoke, she noticed a woman in a black leather jacket signing Shavon's 
banner. It was Robert's aunt. 
</P>
<P>
 In a moment, the two women were sighing together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got to do something about these gangbangers," Sandifer said. "It's 
terrible, it don't make no sense." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to start now," Dean said.

SMOG AGENCY SEEKS TO PUT LID ON RESTAURANT BROILERS; POLLUTION: PLAN WOULD 
FORCE ABOUT 6,000 EATERIES TO CURB EMISSIONS. BUSINESSES FEAR ECONOMIC IMPACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At the corner of Beverly and Rampart boulevards in Los Angeles, the 
mouthwatering smell of Tommy's famous chili burgers has wafted through the air 
for almost 50 years. But that familiar odor of burgers -- savory to some, 
unpleasant to others -- could soon be a thing of the past throughout the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Although fumes from burgers, steaks, chicken and other fried and broiled foods 
may be relished by gourmands and gluttons, they also are a major source of 
smog. From McDonald's and In-N-Out Burgers to Lawry's and Ruth's Chris Steak 
House, about 6,000 restaurants would be forced to reduce smoke from 
charbroilers, griddles and deep-fat fryers under a proposal unveiled Thursday 
by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency says Southland restaurants emit 33 tons of pollution into the air 
daily -- as many hydrocarbons as oil refineries and nine times more soot 
particles than all the region's buses. Fat, as it decomposes, releases 
petroleum-based gases into the air, and when grease drops on open flames, it 
emits smoky particulates that obstruct visibility and lodge in lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to give up our burgers. We just won't be choking on as much 
smoke," AQMD spokesman Sam Atwood said. "Restaurants are a very significant 
source of emissions. This is not a tiny, insignificant source." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the AQMD proposal, restaurants in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties that cook more than 50 pounds of meat per day and 25 pounds 
of non-meat would have to reduce emissions. That would encompass fast-food 
chains, large restaurants, "mom-and-pop" operations and coffee and doughnut 
shops. Residential kitchens, catering vehicles and charity operations would be 
exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD officials -- who had postponed the proposal for five years because of 
concerns of restaurant owners and technical gaps -- are bracing for the same 
type of jokes and public backlash they faced in 1990 when they targeted fumes 
from back-yard barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of workshops to discuss the proposal begins Tuesday, while the air 
quality board has scheduled a vote in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant representatives reacted with concern Thursday, saying they would 
have trouble complying with the proposed deadlines and pollution limits and 
might have to increase prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the first phase of the proposal, existing restaurants would have three 
years to meet a limit of 2.25 pounds of hydrocarbons per day -- equivalent to 
cooking about 1,200 quarter-pound burgers -- and one pound of particulates, 
equal to about 500 Quarter Pounders, said Peter Votlucka, an AQMD air quality 
engineer. New restaurants would have two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In seven years, all restaurants would have to reduce their emissions to no 
more than half a pound of hydrocarbons a day and 0.4 of a pound of 
particulates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will affect every chain. Anybody who cooks meat will have a 
problem," said Larry Leis, construction services director for Irvine-based El 
Pollo Loco, which operates about 150 restaurants in the four-county basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Breitbart, business issues consultant for the California Restaurant 
Assn., said the provisions are especially unreasonable for popular fast-food 
restaurants that cook large volumes of burgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toughest part of this thing is that we cannot control the consumer and we 
cannot control the product," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To comply, many restaurants might turn to essentially the same smog control 
technology installed on automobiles -- catalytic converters. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Southland restaurants, including one at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, 
are experimenting with the catalysts. Attached to a steel hood on top of a 
charbroiler, it turns the cooking fumes into harmless water and carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
 But Breitbart said that installing the devices costs $5,000 to $10,000, and 
that they may not be effective enough to meet the proposed limits.  
</P>
<P>
 Many restaurant owners also question the accuracy of AQMD tests that measure 
emissions from their broilers and fryers, suggesting that no one really knows 
how much they emit. Leis said the industry needs more time to ensure that the 
testing procedure is on target. 
</P>
<P>
 El Pollo Loco has cleaned up much of its smoke by devising a chicken cooker 
that sits upright and prevents grease from dripping onto flames. At a cost of 
$30,000 per restaurant, the chain has installed them at 25 locations and plans 
to expand their use to all sites in the basin if the rule is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leis said the new cookers will probably satisfy only the first phase of 
requirements -- which he called "a good, practical, reasonable" proposal. The 
second, more stringent step would be "awfully hard to attain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think it will be economically prohibitive," Leis said. "The 
technologies are not out there now and the AQMD is banking on those 
technologies coming forth." 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD officials believe their proposal would eliminate 60% of emissions from 
all the region's restaurants -- amounting to a reduction of almost 12 tons of 
hydrocarbons per day and eight tons of particulates. 
</P>
<P>
 Breitbart said the AQMD is grossly overestimating the extent of the problem 
because it bases its estimates on restaurants that charbroil the fattiest meat 
-- hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying that restaurants shouldn't have to be regulated," he said. 
"What we're saying is let's try to find out what we are trying to regulate 
before we pass a rule." 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD spokesman Bill Kelly compared the concerns to those raised four years ago 
when the AQMD ordered manufacturing changes in barbecue lighter fluid. At the 
time, some opponents coined the misleading phrase "use a barbecue, go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kelly said manufacturers have succeeded in complying by creating many 
barbecue fluids, chips and other new products that are cleaner burning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a success story," Kelly said. "It has cleaned the air and people can 
still barbecue using a great number of products."

SCIENTISTS THINK EACH BIG QUAKE SETS UP ANOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists investigating the cat's cradle of faults underlying Southern 
California believe the Northridge earthquake -- the costliest in U.S. history 
-- measurably increased the quake potential in areas of metropolitan Los 
Angeles in a pattern that seems to have shaped major temblors here since 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 A new analysis of nine serious earthquakes over the past 61 years suggests 
that each relayed enough subtle stress along the region's intricate fault lines 
to trigger a subsequent serious earthquake years later, like a falling domino 
knocking over the next block in line. 
</P>
<P>
 The stress generated by the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, for example, may have 
triggered the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake and advanced the onset of 
January's devastating Northridge temblor by several decades, a team of 
earthquake experts reported todayin the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, the precariously balanced faults underlying the region can feel 
one another tremble across space and time, even though the amount of force 
involved may be no more than that generated by a person pressing his palms 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows exactly what triggers any one earthquake or what dictates its 
timing. Scientists have been groping for decades toward an understanding of the 
signals that precede a major seismic shock. 
</P>
<P>
 The new insight into the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake arises from an 
analysis of the shifting tensions generated by local quakes of magnitude 6 or 
more, done by scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, the 
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts and the Institut de 
Physique du Globe in Strasbourg, France. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers emphasized that their work cannot be used to predict when the 
next major earthquake will occur in Southern California, but that it can serve 
as a reliable indicator of where the earthquake potential in the Los Angeles 
region has risen and where it has dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Other earthquake experts said Thursday they were intrigued by the work but 
remained skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is interesting, but it is not proven," said USGS seismologist Lucile M. 
Jones in Pasadena. "The work is important, but it is as much for the questions 
that it raises as for what it answers. If the (Sylmar) quake really triggered 
Northridge, then what made it wait for 23 years?" 
</P>
<P>
 In its study, the team calculated that the cumulative effect of all the major 
earthquakes in the region since 1933 has been to lessen the stress throughout a 
zone extending from the San Fernando Valley south to the coast and along the 
San Andreas Fault between the Tejon Pass and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 However, stresses have increased in a region encompassing the central Los 
Angeles Basin and areas west of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know that earthquakes drop stress, but they also increase the stress 
at other points. These stress changes are small and cannot produce an 
earthquake by themselves," said USGS earthquake expert Ross S. Stein, who led 
the team that calculated the stress changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "These stress changes can advance an earthquake by several decades or even 
trigger one," he said. "We do sense that these earthquakes over very long 
distances feel each other. We think because they interact and feel each other, 
they slow each other down or speed each other up." 
</P>
<P>
 The group calculated that, as a result of the Jan. 17 quake, the geologic vise 
collapsing the region by about half an acre every year is today squeezing 
harder on faults under a wide area of the Los Angeles Basin: the San Fernando 
Valley, Thousand Oaks and Agoura Hills, Simi Valley, Glendale, and parts of 
Downtown and the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The team also calculated that, as a consequence of the Northridge quake, 
pressure has eased slightly in Malibu, Topanga Canyon, along the northern part 
of Santa Monica Bay and through portions of the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to look at those areas now that have faults whose stress has 
increased as a result of past earthquakes," said Thomas L. Henyey, a USC 
earthquake expert and director of the Southern California Earthquake Center. 
"Those may be areas we may want to key on, but you are dealing with large 
patches of ground and many, many faults. You cannot say which of these faults 
will be affected." 
</P>
<P>
 The team calculated the distribution of small pressure changes radiating from 
the epicenter of each major earthquake, revealing a distinctive pattern of 
higher stress levels that resembles the outline of a butterfly. When the 
researchers calculated the pattern for the 1971 Sylmar quake, they found that 
subsequent major earthquakes seemed to cluster in lobes of the butterfly 
"wings." 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern of increased stress in the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake 
also reveals the characteristic butterfly shape, and now some seismologists 
believe that they are detecting increased numbers of barely perceptible 
micro-quakes in the lobes of the wings. 
</P>
<P>
 While Stein's study has taken a regional approach, a second group of USGS 
experts has been analyzing the changing stress on individual faults. Since Jan. 
17, they have identified half a dozen quakes with a magnitude greater than 5 
that were triggered in locations "where they would have been encouraged by the 
Northridge shock," said USGS geophysicist Robert W. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are looking at the potential interaction of faults, the stresses are 
pretty small," Simpson said. "We are accumulating a pile of evidence that is 
suggesting these small, static stress changes do make a difference." Stress 
Patterns 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake potential in some areas of metropolitan Los Angeles rose 
slightly as a consequence of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, according to a 
new analysis of how earthquakes affect each other. Some scientists believe that 
stresses from the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, for example, helped trigger the 1987 
Whittier Narrows quake and the temblor in Northridge earlier this year.

BROWN PLEDGES SESSIONS IN L.A. ON ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Promising to be a better friend to business than Republicans have been, 
Democrat Kathleen Brown pledged Thursday that if she becomes governor in 
January she will convene her new Administration -- and the state Legislature 
too, if possible -- in Los Angeles to hammer out an economic recovery plan for 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within the first month of my Administration," the Democratic gubernatorial 
nominee told San Fernando Valley business leaders, "I will summon my cabinet -- 
not to Sacramento -- but right here to Los Angeles, to focus the full attention 
and resources of the state on the basin's economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she would formally request that the full state Legislature convene 
an unprecedented session in Los Angeles to hold hearings on her program, which 
includes incentives to build a modern ground transportation manufacturing base 
in Southern California, to revive the aerospace industry and to speed 
construction of the Alameda Transportation Corridor serving the ports of Los 
Angeles and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign press spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson, Brown's foe in the Nov. 8 
election, scoffed at the proposal as "showmanship." But state Senate President 
Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) embraced it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is the engine that drives the whole and it is essential that we 
get it more robust," Lockyer said. "What's been lacking is any imaginative 
executive leadership from the governor's office." 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) was unavailable for comment 
Thursday, a day after the Legislature recessed for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker Brown held a two-day "economic summit" in Los Angeles early last year 
to discuss ways of making California more business-friendly. The conference led 
to passage of legislation designed to improve the state's business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 The only time the entire Legislature has formally met outside Sacramento since 
it became the state capital in 1854 was in the 1950s, in the former capital of 
Benecia for a symbolic commemorative meeting, state Assembly Chief Clerk E. 
Dotson Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the state treasurer, said her goal is to have her economic program, 
which she said would not require new taxes, passed into law within the first 
100 days of her Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that, like the late Republican President Richard Nixon going to 
China, she might be the leader who is able to pare and streamline the state 
bureaucracy and regulatory tangle in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon startled the political world with an eight-day trip to China in February 
of 1972 to initiate normalization of relations with the Communist regime. Many 
felt that Nixon managed to pull it off in part because he and other Republicans 
had been the most vocal foes of Communism in China. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Republicans commonly accuse Democrats of being anti-business by 
favoring higher taxes and more spending and by protecting a growing, entrenched 
bureaucracy. Republicans argue that they are the best friends of business and 
the ones most interested in cutting back on the bureaucracy and regulatory red 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown said that in 1994 she is the one who can "bring to the table the 
spirit and ability to make things change," although she indirectly blamed the 
Democrat-controlled Legislature, as well as Wilson, for failing to respond to 
the state's economic problems.  
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a question about the state's attitude toward business and 
resistance to change, Brown added, "What's happened in California, frankly -- 
12 years of Republican governors and legislative complacency -- has been that 
California has become anti-business in its approach to all of these issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown restated her frequent criticism of Wilson, saying that he tends to blame 
Congress or illegal immigration or the Legislature for California's problems 
rather than doing something about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she would be the kind of leader who would "get in there and roll up 
your sleeves and get under the hood and do what Ross Perot said and 'just fix 
it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And that is the kind of governor that I intend to be," Brown said in her 
address to about 125 people attending a meeting of the Valley Industry and 
Commerce Assn. at the Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot, the blunt-talking billionaire businessman who ran as an independent for 
President against Republican George Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992, 
stressed a populist premise that government's problems weren't all that hard to 
fix, if someone just had the determination and political will to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson press aide Dan Schnur derided Brown's proposal for Los Angeles cabinet 
and legislative sessions as "showmanship and political gamesmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur said Wilson has spent nearly half his time as governor since 1991 in 
Southern California, adding, "It might be hard for her to believe, but even 
when we're in Sacramento, we're able to pay close attention to what is 
happening in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing substantive that Kathleen Brown has proposed so far in this 
campaign that we are not either in the process of doing, have already done or 
found a better way to do it," Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown proposal fits with her campaign strategy that jobs and the economy 
remain the key issues in vote-rich Southern California. She presented 
regionally tailored economic proposals in Orange and Riverside counties the 
past two days and planned to do so today in Los Angeles, Bakersfield, Fresno 
and Modesto. The speeches were depicted by campaign aides as part of an early 
start on the traditional Labor Day kickoff of the fall election campaign and a 
shift away from the summer's focus on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown cited Wilson's creation of the California Environmental Protection 
Agency (Cal/EPA) as an example of expanded bureaucracy under Republican 
administrative control the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cal/EPA has not helped us," she added. "Cal/EPA has added a whole new layer 
without getting rid of all the others. In the coming weeks, I will be talking 
about how we can streamline this government, how we can cut bureaucratic waste, 
how we can consolidate, merge and eliminate programs." 
</P>
<P>
 A Brown aide later said she is not proposing to abolish the state EPA. 
</P>

COLUMN ONE; HOLOCAUST HAUNTS HEIRS' BID; THE TOPF BROTHERS BUILT THE OVENS FOR 
THE NAZI DEATH CAMPS. NOW, THEIR DESCENDANTS WANT THE FACTORY AND VILLA SEIZED 
AFTER THE WAR -- TESTING THE LIMITS OF GERMANY'S TANGLED LAND RESTORATION 
PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The image was unforgettable: Oskar Schindler climbing out of his 
Mercedes-Benz, noticing a flurry of ash drifting down from the sky, sniffing 
the wind, flicking with puzzled irritation the flakes from his windshield and 
his trim, double-breasted suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers of the movie "Schindler's List" know that this apparent midsummer 
snowstorm was really human ash, the incinerated remains of the Jews and others 
gassed at Hitler's death camps. What viewers may not have known is that such 
storms were the patented work of a family business here in east-central 
Germany, J.A. Topf & Soehne. During the Second World War, the company made the 
ovens used to dispose of the bodies of those murdered at Auschwitz, Dachau and 
Buchenwald. 
</P>
<P>
 If it hadn't been for Topf ovens, the Nazis would have had a far harder time 
killing so many and leaving so little evidence. And, chillingly, there are 
indications that the family was proud of its work. A visitor to the Holocaust 
memorial site at Buchenwald can inspect the old crematories and see the ovens, 
the doors handsomely emblazoned with the name Topf in Gothic brass letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Today too, half a century later, the family's factory still stands on a side 
street in the Thuringian capital of Erfurt, not far from the family villa, set 
on a large tract of urban parkland. The Topfs had their property seized by the 
Soviets at the end of the war; the factory fell into disrepair, and the villa 
swimming pool is full of dirt. But no matter. Today, in a bizarre land claim, 
one that is remarkable even in a country plagued by post-Communist property 
tangles, a new generation of Topfs is trying to get the old manufacturing 
domain back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heirs have the duty to take responsibility for the past," says Dagmar Topf, a 
50-year-old therapist from the northernmost German state of Schleswig-Holstein 
who, in the name of the Topf brothers' descendants, filed a claim in 1990 on 
the factory, park and villa. The parkland alone is said to be worth at least 
$2.5 million. But Topf, the daughter-in-law of a late factory director, argues 
that it is social consciousness, and not greed, that motivates her and those 
she represents. If the factory were in family hands, she says, she and the 
other Topfs would find ways of running it that might somehow atone for the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 "This company was involved in the terrible things that happened," she says. 
"My personal task now is to see to it that such things never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe yes, maybe no -- but in any case, how could such a land claim prosper? 
Why should the German legal system entertain the arguments of a woman whose 
Nazi-collaborator in-laws were apprehended, interrogated and irreversibly 
expropriated? 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the Topf descendants may never get their family's property back -- 
the head of the land-claims office in Erfurt predicts as much -- but 
nevertheless, the eagerness with which Dagmar Topf has pursued her mission says 
much about the chaotic state of property ownership in what used to be East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 For the younger Topfs are not the only westerners who have been trying, since 
1990, to lay claim to a piece of eastern German real estate -- far from it. 
During the Third Reich, the Nazis seized homes and businesses from Jews and 
other perceived enemies of the state; then, when the Soviets rolled into what 
would later become East Germany, they expropriated countless more properties 
from the fascists and their supporters, real and perceived. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, for the four decades that East Germany did business as a Communist 
country, the authorities treated all this seized real estate as "the people's" 
property, and parceled it out as living quarters and "people's enterprises." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, with reunification in 1990, the authorities gave eastern Germany's 
dispossessed, and their offspring, the chance to set things right. Anyone whose 
property was confiscated between 1933 and 1945, or between 1949 and 1990, was 
empowered to demand restitution or compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That was when Dagmar Topf made her move. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the Wende (the Great Change), I was moved to come forward and say, 'I 
know what my relatives did. I want to use my knowledge to create something. To 
build something. To improve something,' " she says. "So, we talked it over, and 
(my father-in-law's) side of the family decided to authorize me to represent 
them." She filed her first claim in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Which put her in ample company. As of this year, 1.2 million people have come 
forward in Germany, seeking more than 2.7 million pieces of real estate in the 
former East. The government has been swamped sorting out who owns what, 
separating legitimate claimants from charlatans, and deciding what to do in the 
not-uncommon cases in which, say, addressing the claims of descendants of an 
emigre Jew would mean evicting an innocent eastern German family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do our best to see that more than half of the claims are settled by 
the end of 1995," says Hans-Juergen Schaefer, president of the Federal 
Department of Unsettled Property Ownership. "But it is very difficult, and I'm 
certain that we won't be done with all the claims until sometime after the year 
2000." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, investment in the dilapidated and needy former East has slowed to a 
crawl, and resentment among easterners toward the western land claimants is 
impossible to miss. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Saxony-Anhalt town of Barby, someone torched the central land-title 
office last year in an apparent attempt to destroy the property records and put 
a halt to the restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 And in another particularly sad case, a well-known East German reform 
activist, Detlef Dalk, killed himself during a property dispute after composing 
an eloquent suicide note in which he protested "the gigantic flood of property 
from the east to the west" and called the claim on his land "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a certain number of false claims," admits Schaefer, "and when 
someone pursues an illegitimate claim, they can do so very skillfully, so that 
it takes a long time to find it out. But I would say that is only a small 
percentage. Most claims are filed in good faith." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The case of the Nazi oven works started over a century ago, when Julius 
Andreas Topf, a blacksmith, opened a furnace and heating-equipment foundry in 
Erfurt. Topf had heard that in Milan, Italy, the city fathers were 
experimenting with cremation, and it struck him as a good business opportunity. 
He asked his engineers to work on the burning of corpses, and even joined a 
promotional society called Friends of Cremation. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1920s, J.A. Topf & Soehne, operated by the founder's sons, Ernst 
Wolfgang and Ludwig, was selling crematories to cities as far away as Lisbon 
and Brussels, as well as throughout Germany.  
</P>
<P>
 Then came the rise of Adolf Hitler. The Jews were herded into ghettos, then 
shipped to concentration camps, and eventually selected for forced labor or 
gassing. At this point, the activities of J.A. Topf & Soehne become somewhat 
murky. 
</P>
<P>
 How much did Ernst Wolfgang and Ludwig know about the mass murders? Nothing, 
insists Dagmar Topf: "I feel quite sure that they didn't know how their ovens 
were being used." 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that the brothers joined the National Socialist Party in 1935, 
but Dagmar Topf maintains they did so only under pressure. "You have to 
understand about German history," she says. "If you didn't go along with the 
system, you had lots of problems." 
</P>
<P>
 But does that really explain the zeal with which J.A. Topf & Soehne fulfilled 
its contracts? One company engineer, Kurt Pruefer, went so far as to take out a 
patent on his "Auschwitz style" twin-chambered oven, boasting that its burning 
capacity -- 30 to 36 corpses in 10 hours -- easily beat the competition. 
Pruefer went on to invent a 46-chambered oven, and reportedly won the nickname 
"the Wizard of Cremation" around the Topf factory. How could he not have known 
what was going on? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it's true that the company built four big crematoria at Auschwitz," says 
Dagmar Topf. "But at that time, you could have called them civil crematoria." 
She pulls out a scholarly work on Nazi cremation technology, which shows that 
while the Topf brothers' first order from the SS -- the special Nazi police -- 
came in late 1939, the gassing of the Jews began in earnest in March, 1943. 
Until then, Topf argues, it is reasonable to assume that the ovens were needed 
only to cremate camp inmates who died in epidemics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was only on the date of March 13, 1943, that the misuse of the crematoria 
began," she says. "It was a tragedy for the company, and also a tragedy for the 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the war, when Germany was divided among the Allies, the 
administration of Erfurt, a city not far from Buchenwald, fell to the Soviets. 
They seized the oven factory and sent Pruefer and several other senior managers 
to Siberian work camps. Ludwig Topf took his life in the villa. Ernst Wolfgang 
hastened to the French-administered zone in the West, eventually going into 
business there; he died without returning to live in what became East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was burned in those ovens was already dead," he told a German court in 
the early 1960s. "You can't hold the builders of the ovens responsible for the 
deaths of the people who were burned in them." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Erfurt, East Germany's socialist overlords gave the Topf factory a new 
name: the "Erfurt People's Malting and Storage-Container Construction Co.," or 
E.M.S. The rank and file were put to work building breweries, field kitchens 
and silos for the Soviet Union, as war reparations. The villa was converted 
into a kindergarten. As the years passed, hundreds of political employees found 
their way onto the E.M.S. payroll, and the company settled into a routine of 
building huge storage elevators for the East German grain crop. 
</P>
<P>
 One fast-rising staff member, as it happens, was a man named Udo Braun, a 
descendant of the oven makers. His father, the factory's production manager in 
the Nazi years, had been condemned to Siberia. While the elder Braun shivered 
in the Soviet subarctic, Udo was starting as an apprentice, earning an array of 
engineering degrees, and working his way up through the E.M.S. ranks, always in 
the face of discrimination by Communists, he says, who would never let him 
forget what his father had done. 
</P>
<P>
 By the beginning of the 1980s, Braun had become E.M.S.' production manager and 
interim chief executive. Then, in 1989, the Berlin Wall came down, and E.M.S., 
like all East German "people's enterprises," was faced with liquidation, 
privatization, or a return to its pre-Communist owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Dagmar Topf says she knew that lots of hustlers and carpetbaggers were 
flocking east, trying to grab the best pieces of the old industrial stock. She 
feared the worst for the staff at her ancestral oven works: "There were many, 
many employees who had been with the firm for 30 or 40 years," she says. "There 
was a great danger that they would be fired. We were afraid that someone would 
buy the place just to get the real estate, and not to save the factory and the 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 But to Udo Braun, one of those easterners who had toughed it out in Erfurt 
through the Communist years, the worst danger came precisely from the likes of 
Dagmar Topf. "That woman is so dumb!" he exclaims when her name comes up. "I am 
trying to remain charming, but with her it is simply impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, after the Wall came down, I was very euphoric," he goes on, 
sitting in shirt sleeves on a warm Friday afternoon. "I just didn't think about 
property rights. But later on, when the first prospective investors came and I 
could sense that some of them were speculators, then I got the feeling that we 
were in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 The government told Braun he had three months to find financial backing for 
the factory, or it would be liquidated. Braun says he jumped into his car and 
began crisscrossing Germany, looking for business contacts in the unfamiliar 
West. He says he logged more than 60,000 miles, and finally found an investor 
on his birthday, April 2, 1993. By the end of June, the factory was private, 
and the new owner had made him CEO. The factory, which today employs 85 people, 
makes steel containers for preparing malt used in brewing beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dagmar Topf says the privatization was a "brutal" affair, and that Braun has 
fired hundreds of E.M.S. staffers. "Of course there had to be some firings," 
she says. "It wasn't economically feasible to keep all the hundreds of jobs. 
But I wanted to save some of the jobs. And I didn't have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The government has rejected most of the Topf descendants' claims -- on 
technical, not moral, grounds. The German unification treaty says that nothing 
expropriated by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 can be given back, and the 
Topf factory was seized during that time. There are still-unresolved Topf 
claims on the villa parkland, but officials in the Erfurt land-claims office 
say they expect these eventually will be denied. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't stop Dagmar Topf. She is combing the corporate and German state 
archives, trying to uncover more secrets from the past. "This part of history 
should never be closed," she argues. "I want to make sure that all the facts 
are clear. It's a sociopolitical task." 
</P>
<P>
 And what of Braun? Does he ever stop to contemplate the oddness of it all? The 
Topf heirs are all but shut out, but here he is, coming to work each day, 
running the plant where his father played his own unique role in the Nazi 
horror. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," he says. "I was 9 years old at the end of the war, and my father 
was taken away for some investigation. . . . And then, when I was at school, 
they sent us to look at an exhibition about the Holocaust, and we had to look 
at all these shrunken heads and human skins. It was very shocking -- as 
shocking as it must have been for the citizens of Weimar, when they were forced 
to get onto buses and go walk through Buchenwald. I never forgot a single 
detail of that exhibition. I think it was good that I had to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, when I became an apprentice here, they put all of us into one room and 
showed us pictures, so that we knew that the owner of this place had once 
produced those ovens. The East German state wanted us to know this history. But 
they did it in a peculiar way. They were constantly saying, 'We are the new 
state, and we had nothing to do with this.' They kept repeating and repeating 
it, and of course, when you hit someone again and again in the same place, it 
starts to get tired. Sometimes it's very hard to be a German."

L.A. COLISEUM IS BACK ON SOLID GROUND

 The Olympic Torch was relit atop the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on 
Thursday, marking the rededication of the venerable stadium after a $60-million 
repair that has become a symbol of the city's recovery effort after the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 A long, spectacular fuse touched off by the mayor, the chairwoman of the 
County Board of Supervisors, the chief of the federal disaster agency and other 
officials, all holding small torches, sent tiny explosions cascading toward the 
peristyle and up to the torch, which overlooks the only stadium to serve as the 
main venue for two modern Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers, who during Thursday's rededication ceremony continued to toil high 
above the crowd, connecting the huge new video screen and the scoreboard, 
cheered as the gigantic torch -- like so many other parts of the stadium torn 
askew by the Northridge earthquake -- burst into flame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, the . . . Coliseum is officially open for business," said Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, president of the Coliseum Commission and chairwoman of the 
Board of Supervisors. "It is the only outdoor sporting venue in Southern 
California that meets current seismic safety codes. That means when you come to 
cheer the Raiders, you won't have to worry about the (quake magnitude) scales." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the first football game will be a college contest, scheduled for 
Saturday at noon between USC and Washington. The Raiders open their home season 
against the Seattle Seahawks on Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 There were many speeches Thursday and lots of politics -- a letter from 
President Clinton, a videotaped appearance by Gov. Pete Wilson, and a personal 
appearance and speech by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose 
reelection bid may have been given a small boost by friendly remarks about her 
by Los Angeles' Republican mayor, Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also presented a special award to Don C. Webb, the project director 
who began working on the repair the day of the earthquake, long before he was 
formally authorized to do so. Kind words were offered for Ron Tutor as well, 
head of Tutor-Saliba, the prime contractor who pushed his work force to finish 
the repair out of loyalty to USC, his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 Gratitude, too, was expressed to the federal government, which has put up 90% 
of the repair money, and the state government, which has promised to pay the 
remaining 10%. Federal and state officials on many occasions supported the 
repair project, even when repair cost estimates nearly doubled from $33 million 
to $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main star of the show was the 71-year-old stadium itself, looking 
nearly brand-new and in the eyes of most of the rededication crowd of hundreds 
of people, better than it has in many years. 
</P>
<P>
 After a massive repair conducted by workers laboring around the clock for six 
months, the Coliseum literally sparkled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Its peristyle, just two weeks ago the scene of huge drills and massive cement 
trucks, appeared in impeccable shape, its travertine tiles back in place, and 
the new video screen and separate scoreboard representing a considerable 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all the seats were in place, 10,000 cracks were sealed and new 
seismic reinforcements -- piles driven 90 feet into the earth and 56 
reinforcing A-beams with more concrete than 15 freeway overpasses -- were 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take the peripheral landscaping some time to fully take hold, but the 
plants are there, and the stadium's exterior is no longer bare and torn up. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the remainder of the partially demolished press box seemed to fit the 
renovated stadium. An area of temporary seating for the press, covered by a 
tent, was ready for Saturday's game. A new press box is due to be constructed 
after the football season. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's ceremony was followed by an unusually warm statement from the 
Raiders, whose officials often have been at odds with the Coliseum Commission 
over terms for playing in the facility. The team will play rent-free this year 
while negotiating for further stadium improvements, such as luxury boxes, in 
the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire Raider organization certainly recognizes the tremendous 
accomplishments of Don Webb, Supervisor Burke, Ron Tutor and so many others," 
said team attorney and spokeswoman Amy Trask. "We hope all Southern California 
comes out and sees an outstanding Raider team play a season of exciting Raider 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett, speaking for the other primary Coliseum 
tenant, expressed optimism for USC's football fortunes this fall, and 
confidence that the school would break its long losing streak to Notre Dame in 
its final Coliseum appearance of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron Tutor's a magician, an absolute magician," Garrett added. 
</P>
<P>
 James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, read the 
letter from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rededication of the Coliseum represents one of the crowning achievements 
of the recovery effort," the President wrote. "This arena, home of two 
Olympiads and countless other thrilling events, has always embodied the finest 
attributes of the Los Angeles spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, the Coliseum stands as a symbol of renewal, reminding all of us that 
destruction and discouragement can give way to growth and hope for a better 
future. Each of you who has worked to restore this glorious structure can be 
proud of your contributions to the recovery of your great city." 
</P>
<P>
 In his videotaped message, Wilson paid tribute to the "many months of hard 
work" that allowed the doors of the stadium to be opened in time for the 
football season. 
</P>
<P>
 "And as those doors do open, the L.A. Coliseum will welcome a new generation 
of citizens into its friendly confines," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein noted that "like the many sports victories here, today's 
rededication marks the triumph of determination and courageous effort." But the 
former San Francisco mayor could not resist mentioning her hometown's pro 
football team, the 49ers, which, she said, had played many outstanding teams in 
the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Riordan declared: "The rebuilding of the Coliseum is a welcome 
reminder of the continuous revitalization of our city. The hundreds of workers 
responsible for this project have truly returned a symbol of hope back to the 
great citizens of Los Angeles."

JUDGE BLOCKS BUS FARE HIKE, SETS REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW and HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hours after a 25-cent bus fare increase went into effect Thursday, a federal 
judge temporarily blocked it, agreeing that poor and minority passengers would 
suffer hardship under the higher fare. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to charges that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
discriminated against its predominantly poor ridership, U.S. District Judge 
Terry J. Hatter Jr. issued a temporary restraining order rolling back the fare 
hike. He set a Sept. 12 hearing to decide whether to permanently block the 
first fare increase in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to raising fares from $1.10 to $1.35 Thursday, the agency also 
eliminated most discount bus passes. Although Hatter's ruling requires the 
agency to reinstate the passes, only selected outlets will have them available 
today. Full implementation of monthly pass distribution and sales is expected 
by Tuesday, MTA spokeswoman Andrea Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare increases were authorized by the MTA board after a series of raucous 
public hearings, including one so fierce that transit police clad in riot gear 
were summoned. The 13-member MTA board approved the increase in July, claiming 
that it would give the agency $40 million a year that was needed to balance its 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the MTA to balance its budget on the backs of the poor is unacceptable 
and the judge agreed," said Constance Rice, an attorney for the NAACP Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund, which filed the class-action civil rights lawsuit 
on behalf of the Labor/Community Strategy Center, Bus Riders Union and other 
groups.  
</P>
<P>
 "This case is not about bus vs. rail, or inner city vs. suburbs; it's about 
whether the MTA is required by law to implement a transit plan that does not 
disproportionately place burdens on any one group. Are we spreading these 
resources fairly?" Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus riders were elated over Thursday's development. Curtis Wical, 32, 
estimated that his transit costs would have doubled with the fare hike because 
he could no longer buy a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a victory for bus riders," said Wical, a Hollywood resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Some MTA board members condemned the judge's decision. Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich called it a "reckless ruling," saying it illustrated "unfitness to 
serve" as a jurist. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the judge has done is to interject the federal government into the 
establishing of bus fares," Antonovich said. "What are you going to have the 
federal government do -- determine library fees and parking fines and parking 
rates? This is absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Others applauded Hatter's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ecstatic," said Councilman Richard Alatorre. "I didn't believe we had to 
impose a fare increase and do away with passes because of the disproportionate 
impact it had on transit-dependent people in the inner city." 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials declined to comment, saying the judge's decision was under 
review, and canceled a board meeting scheduled for today. However, the agency 
filed a request Thursday asking the judge to reconsider his actions, said board 
member and Glendale Mayor Larry Zarian. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, accused the MTA of 
"inflicting severe and irreversible harm" on bus riders -- most of whom are 
indigent minorities who rely completely on public transit -- by raising fares. 
It alleges that the agency intentionally funneled money to rail projects, 
particularly the planned Pasadena light rail system, at the expense of bus 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 By favoring rail projects, which serve primarily affluent white customers, the 
MTA operates a "separate and unequal system of public transportation," in 
violation of the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the suit 
alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs also cite what they say is a history of discrimination by the 
MTA and the Southern California Rapid Transit District, one of its forerunners. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The rail projects uniformly have more funding and better security, the lawsuit 
alleges. The Pasadena line was allocated $123 million in the current budget, 
$50 million of which came from discretionary funds that could have been used to 
revive the ailing bus system, the plaintiffs contend. 
</P>
<P>
 They argue that MTA officials have turned a deaf ear to their complaints of 
racial and social inequity despite repeated public and private meetings of 
coalition members and the MTA since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In court Thursday, Hatter sharply questioned Rice about the timing of the 
lawsuit, asking: "Why is it you waited until the eve of the fare hike and the 
cessation of bus passes?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rice responded that the citizen groups had done all they could in pursuing 
every avenue toward halting the fare increase, including asking Mayor Richard 
Riordan to schedule an emergency MTA board meeting to reconsider alternatives 
to a fare hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Katzman, attorney for the MTA, said that the agency had done its best 
to cut costs, negotiating new contracts with three labor unions, trimming more 
than 600 staff positions and planning service cuts on underutilized lines. He 
said the agency was unable to shift money allocated for rail construction to 
bus operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not one big pool of funds that can be moved around," he said. "There are 
restrictions on those funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Katzman said that if the agency did not increase fares, it would be forced to 
cut bus and rail service. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not commenting directly on the merits of the lawsuit, Hatter said 
that the plaintiffs had met the technical requirement for winning a temporary 
restraining order by proving that the fare increase would cause irreparable 
harm and hardship. He said Rice had "shown there are serious questions here." 
</P>
<P>
 The more than two dozen bus riders at Thursday's proceedings walked outside 
afterward, hugging one another and cheering. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we showed today is that transit is a human right; it's essential to 
living in this city," said Eric Mann, director of the nonprofit Labor/Community 
Strategy Center, the lead plaintiff trying to roll back fares.

MAN DIES, 415 MYSTERIOUSLY STRICKEN ILL ON CRUISE SHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON and ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One elderly man died and 415 other passengers and crew members of a San 
Pedro-based cruise ship were reported ill Thursday with a mysterious 
gastrointestinal ailment that forced the Viking Serenade back to port a day 
early from a trip to Baja California, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the federal Centers for Disease Control boarded the ship to 
determine the source of the illness. But an agency spokesman said it was too 
early to confirm suspicions of widespread food poisoning or an infectious 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got sick, really sick -- fever, terrible diarrhea, chills. People were 
dropping like flies. I was so weak, I couldn't lift my head from the bed," said 
Caren Blumfield, a West Hills resident who took her children on what was 
supposed to be a relaxing vacation before the start of school. None of her 
three children were stricken, she said. While at least six people remained 
hospitalized Thursday night, most of the others who were stricken appeared to 
be recovering without intensive medical assistance. Officials said the 
affliction seems to have largely run its course. 
</P>
<P>
 After returning to San Pedro at 8 a.m. Thursday, nearly all 1,734 passengers 
and 612 crew members remained on board the Bahamas-registered ship through the 
afternoon, awaiting clearance from health and customs officials. About 500 of 
the passengers, including the Blumfield family, finally left in the late 
afternoon and the others remained for the night, many awaiting airplane 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
 Six passengers had been taken off the white-and-blue vessel and hospitalized 
in Ensenada, one of the stops on what was to be a four-night journey of 
sightseeing, dining and shipboard gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those six, a 78-year-old man, died in the Ensenada hospital, said a 
spokesman for the ship's owner, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David Luna Gonzalez, medical director of the Hospital de las Americas, 
identified the dead man as Clarence Bazar of Long Beach. Even before the 
cruise, Bazar was very ill, suffering from heart disease, diabetes and cancer 
in one of his kidneys, Gonzalez said. Bazar had seemed to be recovering from 
the vomiting and diarrhea when he died of a heart attack Thursday morning, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other five passengers hospitalized in Ensenada -- three men and two women 
from 65 to 80 years old -- were expected to be released in a day or two, 
Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another man, 81-year-old Robert Hoge of Riverside, was taken by ambulance from 
the ship to San Pedro Peninsula Hospital Thursday morning. He was listed in 
fair condition. . 
</P>
<P>
 Centers for Disease Control officials said they planned to obtain body tissue 
and samples from the deceased man to aid in the investigation. Blood, urine and 
stool samples were taken from many other passengers, and the agency's 
epidemiologists conducted surveys on the dining and other activities of the 
passengers and crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to find out what some people did differently from others that 
may have resulted in their becoming ill," said agency spokesman Tom Skinner in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship's water supply, refrigeration system and food-handling equipment were 
inspected Thursday, but no immediate clues were discovered, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miami-based Royal Caribbean Cruises firm promised full refunds to the 
passengers. Depending on cabin size and location, fares ranged from $599 to 
$1,899 a person including air fare, travel officials said. Passengers who did 
not require an air connection paid $150 less. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard D. Fain, Royal Caribbean's chairman, promised cooperation in the 
health inquiry. Passengers' "safety and well-being has always been our first 
concern, and we will be working very closely with authorities to determine the 
cause of this outbreak," Fain said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Viking Serenade passed its most recent government sanitation inspection in 
February. On a scale of 100 points, it rated 89, with a score of 86 considered 
passing, Skinner said. Skinner said he was aware of no past inspection failures 
for the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Susan Mackey, of Rancho Santa Margarita, said an identical illness 
struck passengers on the Viking Serenade on a March 7 cruise to Mexico, with 
symptoms including diarrhea, vomiting and dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
 "This cruise line knew that something was wrong, because we complained about 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such outbreaks of shipboard illness are rare, occurring one to four times a 
year on ships that enter American waters or ports, officials said. One veteran 
customs worker at the Los Angeles port said he could not recall any such 
dramatic incident in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the cruise ship Horizon out of New York was contaminated with 
Legionnaires' disease bacteria, leading to the death of one man and frightening 
symptoms for about 30 other passengers. Investigators said sand used in water 
filters was "strongly implicated." bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday morning, the Viking Serenade left San Pedro; the first reports of 
illness occurred Tuesday while it was docked off Santa Catalina Island. The 
number of ill mounted steadily as the ship headed toward Baja California 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard 10 people were sick. Then 20. Then 100. Then 400," Caren Blumfield 
said. "There were rumors everywhere -- that it was cholera, that we'd all be 
quarantined forever." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was scary because they wouldn't let us know anything," said Melina Keith, 
17, of Irvine, who was traveling with her family. "I saw a man collapse in the 
hallway right in front of me." 
</P>
<P>
 "All around us, people were sick," said Melina's mother, Ann. "We saw lots of 
pale people, people in wheelchairs." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 408 of the 1,734 passengers and eight of the 612 crew members reported 
symptoms. That so few crew members were ill may prove to be a vital clue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why didn't more of the crew get sick?" Blumfield said. "I just don't 
understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the other passengers praised the captain and crew for keeping people 
calm and aiding the sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crew was very helpful, very nice. There was not any panic," recalled 
Brick Price, a Calabasas resident, who took his family on the cruise. He was 
mildly ill and his 8-year-old daughter recovered after she was given 
medication, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1982, the Viking Serenade previously was a car-and-passenger ferry 
called the Stardancer, company officials said. It was rebuilt and re-christened 
three years ago for cruises along the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40,000-ton ship is 607 feet long and has 757 cabins. Among its amenities 
are 173 slot machines and roulette wheels, a swimming pool and a library. 
</P>
<P>
 For some passengers unaffected by the illness, the cruise was a happy 
experience, said Lisa Gasho of Newport Beach, who was a passenger with her 
boyfriend, Steve Schroder. "The food was great, the beer was great," she said. 
"We didn't get sick, and we had a fantastic time!"

U.S. PLAN TO CLEAN STATE'S AIR CRITICIZED; POLLUTION: WILSON ADMINISTRATION 
CALLS EPA PROPOSALS A THREAT TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its first detailed response to the federal government's clean air plan for 
California, the Wilson Administration argues that the costly and comprehensive 
smog abatement strategy would threaten economic recovery, place California at a 
competitive disadvantage and flout the intent of the 1990 federal Clean Air 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the sweeping federal 
plan contains about 100 clean-air measures aimed at virtually every source of 
pollution. It triggered a storm of protest from a variety of industries and 
trade groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Airline officials, for instance, said that the proposed rules would force a 
40% to 60% reduction in flights into the Los Angeles region's five airports. 
Representatives of the trucking, railroad and shipping industries predicted 
similarly dire consequences after the plan was unveiled last February. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting many of those concerns, the Wilson Administration's response took 
issue with the emission control strategies for cars, diesel-powered trucks, 
off-road vehicles, ships, planes, motorcycles and recreational vehicles as well 
as pesticides and certain stationary pollution sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Issued by James Strock, the state's secretary of environmental protection, the 
critique maintains that the proposed federal standard for controlling diesel 
emissions is well beyond the reach of current technology. It contends that a 
system of emission-based fees, to be paid by ships docking at local ports, will 
result not in a conversion to cleaner burning fuels but in the shipping 
industry's shifting "away from Southern California to other states and to 
Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Strock argues that proposed commercial aviation fees amounting to 
$10,000 per ton for excess emissions "will result in an economic penalty in 
California for commercial airport operations." Aircraft engine exhaust 
contributes to smog in two ways, through emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen 
oxides. The latest technology, according to Strock's critique, decreases 
hydrocarbon production but makes little or no change in the release of nitrogen 
oxides. 
</P>
<P>
 The state argues repeatedly that instead of issuing a plan directed solely at 
California, the EPA should be promulgating national standards. For example, on 
the issue of commercial aircraft, the state maintains that "a national engine 
standard is the only effective way to motivate change and create a sufficient 
market for low-emissions engines." 
</P>
<P>
 The state also contends that the federal plan sets such unreasonable limits on 
toxic ingredients in pesticides that many "low-risk" products, for which there 
are no substitutes, would be banned.  
</P>
<P>
 The federal plan was prompted by a lawsuit, brought by several local 
environmental groups, charging both the state and federal governments with 
failing to comply with the 1977 Clean Air Act. The state contends that the EPA 
would have grounds to draw up its own plan only if the state fails to meet a 
November deadline set by the 1990 Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, federal officials point out that they have been discussing ways of 
moderating the plan in meetings with a variety of industry representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the state's critique, EPA regional administrator Felicia Marcus 
said, "That's exactly what we want. We have invited everybody to help us out, 
to tell us how we should improve the plan in case we do have to implement it." 
That would happen, Marcus said, only if the state's plan proved inadequate.

 The defenestration of Moscow: Idaho will not dignify with an answer--that is, 
file a response to--a $940,000 claim by a young San Jose man and his parents. 
The former student at the University of Idaho in Moscow, who was hurt when he 
"mooned" other students and fell out a window, argued in a lawsuit that the 
university was negligent for, among other failings, not warning students of the 
risks associated with upper-story dorm windows. Surely there's something in the 
student handbook about gravity and open windows, next to the warning about 
blow-dryers in the bathtub.

URBAN WATER AGENCIES BACK PLAN TO AID BAY; ENVIRONMENT: THE AGREEMENT REMOVES 
OBSTACLES TO DEVISING PROTECTION FOR THE SACRAMENTO-SAN JOAQUIN RIVER DELTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California's urban water agencies provided a significant breakthrough in the 
long battle over the fragile Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta on Thursday by 
agreeing to environmental protections for a brackish bay that serves as a 
nursery for endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing at a State Water Resources Control Board workshop, the state's 11 
largest water agencies announced they have reached an accord with 
environmentalists over the control of salt levels in the Suisun Bay, a rich 
estuary that nurtures a wide variety of plants and fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Urban Water Agencies, a coalition that includes the giant 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, said it now supports the 
establishment of a salinity standard for the bay even though it will mean that 
less water -- particularly in dry periods -- can be shipped south to cities and 
farms. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban officials estimated that they would have to give up about 160,000 
acre-feet of fresh water in  
</P>
<P>
 normal years and 300,000 acre-feet in dry years to comply with the standards. 
(An acre-foot is roughly enough water to supply the needs for two Southern 
California families for a year.) The urban users said they were better off with 
the present agreement than under rigid water-allocation formulas that were 
being proposed a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides said the agreement over a salinity standard removes what has been a 
serious stumbling block in the long and tortuous effort to devise protections 
for the environmentally threatened delta. Farming interests, meanwhile, did not 
immediately take a position on the proposal, although some agricultural water 
agencies told the board they were willing to consider it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a significant movement by the urban agencies to recognize the need for 
better protection for the estuary," said John Krautkraemer, an attorney for the 
Environmental Defense Fund. "It's evidence to me that they really are serious 
about trying to find a way to improve protections for the bay delta estuary." 
</P>
<P>
 The MWD's general manager, John R. Wodruska, said many issues of sharing 
scarce supplies remain to be resolved. But he said urban agencies were 
motivated to reach the latest agreement with the environmentalists by 
provisions of the Endangered Species Act -- a federal law that has been used 
repeatedly to curtail pumping from the delta, along with water deliveries to 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could spend hundreds of millions of dollars to fix something and then the 
next month somebody would come and say, 'Oops, we've found another species 
here,' and then you would get shut down," Wodruska said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the establishment of standards, he said, there would be less need to 
invoke the act and water agencies could have more predictable guidelines to 
follow in their management of diversions from the delta. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ultimate decision on delta standards rests with the state, 
members of the control board have made it clear that they want the warring 
factions -- urban, environmental and agricultural interests -- to reach 
agreements that can provide guidance for a final plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The delta, a vast maze of manmade islands and channels fed by the Sacramento 
and San Joaquin rivers, is an essential water source for people as well as 
nature. Not only does it provide most of the state's drinking water and farm 
irrigation supplies, it also is the habitat for nearly 400 fish and plant 
species, including some that are endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 Water pumped from the delta and sent south via aqueducts in most years 
supplies about half the total distribtued by the MWD. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last decade, the increased demands for water by a growing population 
have prompted more and more pumping from the delta, which in turn has increased 
salt levels and degraded delicate estuaries. In 1987, the state determined that 
the delta needed stronger environmental protections but each time the control 
board proposed new standards, there was outcry from one or more of the rival 
interests.

$7.1 MILLION AWARDED IN HARASSMENT; COURTS: WORLD'S LARGEST LAW FIRM IS ORDERED 
TO PAY FORMER SECRETARY TWICE AS MUCH IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES AS SHE HAD SOUGHT. 
COMPANY SAYS IT WILL APPEAL.

 A former secretary at the world's largest law firm was awarded $7.1 million in 
punitive damages Thursday -- nearly twice as much as she had sought -- by a 
jury that found she had been sexually harassed by one of the firm's veteran 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 The judgment against Baker & McKenzie and its former lawyer is believed to be 
the largest ever awarded in a sexual harassment case, according to one of the 
plaintiff's lawyers, Philip Kay. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-woman, six-man jury had awarded former secretary Rena Weeks $50,000 in 
general damages last week from lawyer Martin Greenstein and the San 
Francisco-based firm where he worked for 22 years. Greenstein resigned in 
October, 1993, at the urging of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase of the trial ended Thursday, when the jury voted 10 to 2 to 
award the $7.1 million, of which the law firm owes $6.9 million and Greenstein 
owes $225,000. Weeks had asked for $3.7 million in punitive damages. The two 
dissenting jurors were women. 
</P>
<P>
 Two jurors said the judgment against Baker & McKenzie was calculated at 10% of 
the capital of the 1,700-lawyer firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the firm's evidence of recent efforts to educate employees about 
sexual harassment, juror Bill Carpenter told reporters: "Some people got 
religion. When you get religion, you should tithe. A tithe is 10%." 
</P>
<P>
 A surprised Weeks said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it never happens again but if it does, I'd do the same thing, because 
I've got my rights, my civil rights, like everybody does." 
</P>
<P>
 John McGuigan, chairman of the law firm's executive committee, said in a 
statement that the firm is "extremely disappointed by the jury's award," which 
he characterized as "grossly disproportionate" to the $50,000 in compensatory 
damages. He said the firm will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the award contrasts to a recent study that found that the sexual 
harassment cases handled by the Equal Opportunity Commission in 1993 resulted 
in $25.2 million awarded to 1,546 employees -- double the amount of monetary 
awards from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks, 40, who worked as a secretary at the law firm for about three months in 
1991 -- spending about a month working for Greenstein -- is now a preschool 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 She alleged that Greenstein dumped candies into a breast pocket of her blouse, 
groped her breast, pressed against her from behind and pulled her arms back to 
"see which (breast) is bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 In the office, she said, he lunged at her breasts. And another time, he 
grabbed her hips, and at a luncheon, asked her repeatedly: "What's the wildest 
thing you've ever done?" She was transferred to another lawyer after 
complaining to an office manager about the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, more than half a dozen other women testified that Greenstein 
had grabbed them, propositioned them or made lewd remarks in incidents dating 
back to 1988. One said he had walked up behind her and poked her in the back 
with a legal file. When she asked what that was, he replied, "Just happy to see 
you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenstein, 49, admitted offensive behavior toward two secretaries, but denied 
Weeks' accusations. His lawyer said Weeks made up her complaints to save her 
job, and that they were "the product of an overactive imagination" and 
motivated by reading an office handbook on sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker & McKenzie acknowledged complaints from other women about Greenstein but 
said its attempts to investigate were hampered by several women's insistence on 
anonymity. The jury found that the firm had violated Weeks' rights by not 
taking earlier action against Greenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's statement, McGuigan said the firm "rejects the implication that 
it tolerates personal or professional misconduct of any type." 
</P>
<P>
 The case, carried nationally on Court TV, was monitored by businesses and 
lawyers as a test of a company's responsibility to deal with sexual misconduct 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case will be seen as a landmark case (showing that) women have the same 
status as any other group and should be afforded the same civil rights," Kay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what message Thursday's verdict was intended to send, juror Ray Williams 
said: "Hopefully, in the future, companies will regulate their staff more." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the state Legislature approved a bill to allow the clients of 
lawyers, bankers, psychiatrists and 17 other classifications of professionals 
to sue for civil damages on grounds of using a position of trust in a business 
or professional relationship to harass clients or patients.

7.2 QUAKE OFF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST CAUSES NO MAJOR DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK and KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck Thursday off the Humboldt County coast in a 
seismically active area where three tectonic plates converge, but the quake was 
far enough out to sea that no major damage and no injuries resulted. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8:15 a.m. temblor was placed by the U.S. Geological Survey on the 
Mendocino Fault about 90 miles west-southwest of Eureka. It was felt as a long, 
gentle rolling motion through much of Northern California and southwestern 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake's epicenter was under the Pacific, but no tsunami or seismic sea 
wave formed because the quake's movement was horizontal rather than vertical. 
</P>
<P>
 In this colorful town of Victorian-style homes and businesses, the quake shook 
just a few books from the library shelves, but it did remind uneasy residents 
of their recent earthquake history, which included a magnitude 7.1 temblor two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That large quake in 1992 and its aftershocks damaged 300 homes, injured 356 
people and caused $50 million in damage. Thursday's quake was further offshore 
and, aside from knocking one house off its foundation in the town of Fortuna, 
barely disturbed area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not like the last ones," said Frank Mathes, Ferndale's public works 
director. "This was just a big roller. There was no damage of any kind, 
anywhere. It's amazing considering the magnitude. . . . People are astounded to 
hear the magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford University scientists recently estimated that if a similar but 
slightly smaller quake struck along the Newport-Inglewood fault in urban Los 
Angeles, it would do $125 billion to $145 billion in damage. But this area of 
California's North Coast is sparsely populated except for scattered towns such 
as Ferndale and Eureka, about 20 miles north. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake Thursday was the second strongest to hit in or close to California 
in the 1990s, eclipsed only by the June 28, 1992, quake centered in the Mojave 
Desert near Landers that was magnitude 7.3. The latest quake was the fourth of 
magnitude 7 or greater in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's quake occurred close to the "triple junction" of the North 
American, Pacific and Gorda tectonic plates and not far from the potentially 
deadly Cascadia subduction zone, where scientists have warned that a gigantic 
quake could devastate the Northwest coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Tectonic plates are large land masses that float on the molten core of the 
Earth. The areas where they meet are often associated with volcanic and 
earthquake activity. A subduction zone is a place where one plate pushes under 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Dengler, a seismologist at Humboldt State University, said the Mendocino 
Fault, on which Thursday's quake occurred, forms the boundary between the Gorda 
and Pacific plates. Although a different fault was involved in the 1992 quakes, 
she thinks that it was close enough so that the temblor may have been a 
response to the 1992 quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she did not think that Thursday's quake indicated that the feared 
Cascadia subduction zone quake would happen soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Ellsworth of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., said the 
quake ruptured a segment of the Mendocino fault that was between two segments 
that ruptured in 1954 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The type of rupture, Ellsworth said, was similar, on a much smaller scale, to 
that of the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906. But since the segments on 
either side had ruptured fairly recently, he shared Dengler's view that no 
larger earthquake is imminent.

MOROCCO BECOMES 2ND ARAB NATION TO HAVE FORMAL RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL; 
DIPLOMACY: TWENTY YEARS OF CONTACTS CULMINATE IN AGREEMENT ON LOW-LEVEL TIES 
WITH LIAISON OFFICES. EXPANDED TRADE AND TOURISM ARE PREDICTED. 
</P>

<P>
 Israel and Morocco established low-level diplomatic relations Thursday, making 
the North African country the second Arab nation after Egypt to have formal 
ties with the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 After 20 years of contacts that began clandestinely and grew to open visits to 
Morocco by Israeli ministers, the two countries agreed to establish liaison 
offices and Israeli officials predicted a rapid broadening of ties, including 
expanded trade, direct airline service and increased tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a first step, an opening of the door, and I imagine there will be a 
continuation," said Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who as prime 
minister had visited Morocco's King Hassan II in 1986 and who negotiated the 
agreement over the past three months. "I assume this will influence other 
countries, and we are working in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Although expected since Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin stopped in Morocco en 
route home from signing the peace accord with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization in Washington a year ago, Thursday's move constituted another 
breakthrough in the Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres called it "the opening of a regional relationship," different from 
Israel's efforts to make peace with its immediate Arab neighbors and part of an 
emerging effort to develop economic ties across the whole of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Israel will open a liaison office -- an embassy in all 
but name -- in Rabat, the Moroccan capital; Morocco will open a similar 
diplomatic mission in Tel Aviv, where most countries maintain their embassies. 
Morocco will also establish a liaison office with the new Palestinian Authority 
in Gaza City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather have diplomatic relations immediately, but we must recognize 
the fact that patience sometimes pays off," Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres said the development was made possible by progress in Israel's 
negotiations with the PLO and by Morocco's desire to promote regional economic 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan will host a major economic conference -- the first with extensive 
Israeli and Arab participation -- in the palace in Casablanca at the end of 
October. More than 1,000 political leaders and business executives are expected 
to participate in the session, organized by the Geneva-based World Economic 
Forum and the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan told Peres in a June visit that he was not ready for full diplomatic 
relations, saying they could be achieved only step by step and urging Israel to 
make more progress in peace negotiations with Syria and Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, remains the only Arab 
state with full diplomatic relations with the 46-year-old Jewish state. Jordan 
signed an accord with Israel on July 28, ending the state of war between them 
and pledging to conclude with a peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel had hoped Morocco and other moderate Arab and Muslim states, including 
Tunisia, would quickly establish ties after the historic peace accord with the 
PLO last September. But such moves became politically difficult because of the 
slowness in moving toward Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip, the stalemate 
in negotiations with Syria and the massacre of about 29 Palestinians by a 
Jewish settler while they prayed at a West Bank mosque six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan has long urged other Arab leaders to accept Israel's existence. Rabin, 
wearing a wig, false mustache and thick glasses, visited Rabat in 1976 during 
his first term as prime minister. Hassan later arranged secret meetings between 
Israeli and Egyptian officials, leading to President Anwar Sadat's 1977 visit 
to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the relationship between Israel and Morocco had become 
increasingly open, and Israeli ministers and envoys regularly traveled to Rabat 
for international conferences and political consultations. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade between the two countries was estimated at $100 million in 1993. Israeli 
companies operate two experimental farms in Morocco, training farmers and 
selling Israeli agricultural equipment. Telephone links were established this 
year, and air service is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jews of Moroccan origin in Israel now number about 600,000, about 15% of the 
Jewish population here, and thousands of them return to Morocco each year on 
visits, traveling through France and Spain. About 8,000 Jews still live in 
Morocco, and the current Moroccan Cabinet includes a Jew, Tourism Minister 
Serge Berdugo. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli commentators also speculated that Hassan, a descendant of the Prophet 
Mohammed, is interested in negotiations over the future of Jerusalem and agreed 
to establish the liaison offices to ensure that he had a voice.

RWANDA, ZAIRE PLEDGE TO WORK TOGETHER TO RETURN REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rwanda and Zaire pledged Thursday to help an estimated 1.2 million Hutu 
refugees return to their homeland in Rwanda from wretched camps in eastern 
Zaire, and Zaire urged that they return by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Filippo Grandi, the field chief for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees in Goma, said it was "a big achievement" that both countries had 
agreed to work together. 
</P>
<P>
 "The meeting does give a ray of hope that we can solve the refugee problem in 
the near future," Grandi said after Rwandan and Zairian ministers initialed 
their agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Rwanda's new Tutsi-led government invited Hutu refugee leaders to 
come to Kigali, the Rwandan capital, to help draw up plans to repatriate the 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said they were pleased by the outcome of the meeting here, but 
cautioned against expecting any immediate resolution of the refugee problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint statement adopts the U.N. stand that any repatriation should be 
voluntary, but the Rwandan government wants Zaire to help convince the Hutus 
that it is safe to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1.2 million Hutu refugees fled the advancing army of the Tutsi 
rebels now in power in Rwanda, and more than 800,000 more are in other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The new government says Hutu refugees can return without fear but promises to 
punish anyone involved in the spring's ethnic massacres.

SOUTH AMERICA; REAL-LIFE PRESIDENTIAL SOAP HAS PERUVIANS IN A LATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANA VON HAGEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A marital soap opera unfolding at Lima's presidential palace has Peruvians 
spellbound and tuned to their television sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the popular imported soaps from Brazil and Venezuela, grist of Peruvian 
prime-time television, this one is real and made in Peru: a running dispute 
between President Alberto Fujimori and his estranged wife, Susana Higuchi. 
</P>
<P>
 And it has upstaged Fujimori's main rival for next year's presidential 
elections, Javier Perez de Cuellar, 74. The former United Nations secretary 
general has found his efforts to test Peru's political waters stymied as the 
drama of "Susana andAlberto" hogs the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Higuchi triggered the row in early August when she accused members of the 
Fujimori administration of corruption. She also moved out of the palace to 
protest an electoral law -- quickly dubbed the "Susana law" -- that bans the 
president's close relatives from running for president or Congress in the 
April, 1995, elections. Higuchi has said she is considering a run for the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first lady returned to the palace 10 days later, she found that her 
husband had moved out, to the headquarters of the National Intelligence 
Service. He has stayed there since, along with their four children. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 23, a stern-faced Fujimori, 56, used prime-time television to announce 
that he was stripping Higuchi of her duties as first lady because of her 
"incomprehensible" criticism of the government and her apparent presidential 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 "From now on, Mrs. Higuchi can carry out her political activities in open 
opposition to the government when and where she pleases, like any citizen, but 
not as first lady," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujimori lamented that "intimate family problems" had become "headlines in the 
newspapers" and said he had made many concessions to his wife's "unstable and 
easily impressionable personality," but that the climate of instability had 
forced him to act. Late last week, TV viewers tuned in to hear that Higuchi had 
been locked into the palace -- the doors leading from her offices to a side 
street at the sprawling downtown presidential headquarters had been welded 
shut, and water and electricity were temporarily cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday the doors had been unwelded, which Higuchi sees as a sign of 
possible reconciliation with her husband. "I have faith that this will be 
worked out," she said in a telephone interview.  
</P>
<P>
 Higuchi, 44, insisted that she still loves her husband. "Our differences are 
merely political, not marital," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Palace watchers say the Fujimoris' marriage began to sour in 1990, when 
Fujimori took office. The first outward signs of trouble appeared when Higuchi 
accused her in-laws of trafficking in used clothing donated by Japan, keeping 
the best for themselves and handing out "rags" to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was quickly hushed up and then eclipsed by Fujimori's 1992 coup. In 
what Higuchi said was her "husband's decision," she was kept away from the 
press until June of this year. Then, in a television interview she asked her 
husband to "tone down" authoritarian tendencies and accused him of ignoring the 
plight of Peru's 12 million poor. "He sees the Peru of ribbon-cutting 
ceremonies and pretty things," she said. "I see the Peru of need and misery."

BALTICS-MOSCOW FEUD OUTLASTS TROOPS ISSUE; EUROPE: THE RED ARMY IS GONE, BUT 
RUSSIAN SURVEYORS ARE TRYING TO CLAIM LAND IN BORDER DISPUTE WITH ESTONIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after the tiny Baltic nations bade good riddance to the Red Army, 
Russian surveyors were hacking through a forest Thursday in what is viewed here 
as a menacing new incursion. 
</P>
<P>
 Escorted by lumberjacks and gun-toting soldiers, the surveyors are marking a 
56-mile stretch of the Russian-Estonian border, planting concrete poles every 
50 yards to tighten Moscow's hold on 1,430 square miles. A two-headed eagle, 
the Russian symbol, glares from a plaque on each pole. 
</P>
<P>
 The demarcation began just after Russia agreed in July to withdraw its last 
troops from Estonia and just as Estonia was reviving its claim to the 
territory, which the Soviet Union gave up in 1920 and grabbed back in 1940 when 
the Red Army occupied all of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
 That occupation is over now. But the eagles on the poles are a sign that the 
bitter, half-century conflict between Moscow and the Baltics is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders across the Baltics say the feud is simply entering a more subtle phase 
in which border claims, trade restrictions, energy dependence, television 
propaganda and infiltration by criminals are the main threats to national 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call upon our friends abroad not to fall prey to the illusion that the 
withdrawal of occupation forces has brought the final solution to the 'Baltic 
question,' " Estonian President Lennart Meri said in a speech Wednesday after 
the last Russian naval vessel left port. "We need your support, sometimes even 
greater support now that the future seems more secure and less dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Baltics regained independence from a collapsing Soviet Union three 
years ago, Moscow insisted on better treatment of ethnic Russians -- the 
occupiers and their offspring who make up a third of Estonia's and Latvia's 
populations -- as a condition for bringing the troops home. 
</P>
<P>
 Lithuania, where Russians are 9% of the population, imposed no restrictions on 
citizenship, and the last troops left a year ago. Prodded by President Clinton 
and European leaders, Estonia and Latvia brought their citizenship laws into 
line with international norms and agreed to let thousands of retired Soviet 
officers stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, bowing to the same Western pressure, 
ordered the troops out Wednesday. But not before he signed a decree formalizing 
the Kremlin's role as self-appointed guardian of 25 million ethnic Russians 
scattered across the former Soviet empire. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining the decree, Russian officials say they still regard the Estonian 
and Latvian citizenship laws as too restrictive -- naturalization of Latvia's 
half a million non-citizens, for example, will be spread over nine years -- and 
intend to apply economic pressure to change them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of options," Alexander Udaltsov, a Russian Foreign Ministry 
official, said in a telephone interview Thursday. "It is no secret that most of 
the cargo transferred through the Baltics is destined for Russia. By choosing 
which ports the cargoes go through, we can make these countries take notice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow is already withholding promised trade preferences that would boost 
Latvia's and Estonia's exports to Russia. And Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis 
said the Russians have hinted recently at cutting back supplies of natural gas 
-- a weapon used against the Baltics in winters past. 
</P>
<P>
 Lithuania is also being denied most-favored-nation trading status, for a 
different reason. Russia wants to make permanent its temporary right to move 
military equipment and personnel across Lithuania for a major buildup in the 
Russian Baltic Sea enclave of Kaliningrad. 
</P>
<P>
 Reluctant to accept the loss of its empire, Russia plays big-stick politics 
with all its neighbors, and so far the Baltics have outdone the others in 
asserting their independence. They have created stable currencies and dynamic 
private sectors, kept inflation low and attracted foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are important differences among the three nations that will bear on 
how successfully they deal with Russia in the post-occupation era. 
</P>
<P>
 Lithuania, the slowest to reform, clings to government subsidies for 
producers. Its economy is more dependent on agricultural exports and has few 
markets outside Russia. Latvia and Estonia have pushed economic reform more 
consistently -- at the cost of bankruptcies and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 While Latvia's industry is heavier and tied to Russia's, Estonia's is geared 
to electronics and is more competitive globally. Just 18% of Estonia's trade is 
with the former Soviet Union, compared with 60% of Latvia's and 80% of 
Lithuania's. Estonia has broken its dependence on Russian fuel; its neighbors 
depend on subsidized Russian gas. 
</P>
<P>
 With an economy expected to grow 7% this year, Estonia can afford to challenge 
Moscow more aggressively. In the spring, it pulled the plug on Russia's 
Ostankino television network -- a prime source of Russian propaganda that 
offends the Baltics -- for falling behind in rebroadcast fees. And Estonia is 
pressing its claim to disputed border territory, despite Russia's refusal to 
negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Latvia also has a border quarrel with Russia but is taking a different 
approach. "We have to be active in our foreign policy without creating any 
conflicts," Ulmanis said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three countries have signed free-trade agreements with the European Union 
and expect to gain associate membership soon. They have joined NATO's 
"Partnership for Peace" program and are forming a joint military battalion for 
U.N. peacekeeping duties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting with the three Baltic presidents here in July, President Clinton 
agreed to set up a $50-million American Enterprise Fund to promote U.S. trade 
and investment in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latvia isn't a lonely country anymore," said Lija Busa, 66, who was deported 
from Latvia at age 12 and spent 16 years in a Soviet labor camp. "It is joining 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the troops left, Baltic leaders said they feared that the West might 
not be so attentive to new pressures, including activism by paramilitary groups 
of retired Soviet officers and organized crime by mafia gangs linked to Russian 
intelligence services. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents Ulmanis and Meri put high priority on keeping peace with ethnic 
Russians. But ultimately, they say, the fate of their countries depends on an 
unpredictable Russia, where ultranationalists like Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky 
speak of reabsorbing the Baltic lands. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are small countries on the edge of a very large one, and they're never 
going to be as totally independent as their nationalists like to believe or as 
Russians fear," said Paul A. Goble, a senior associate at the Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace in Washington. "They are always going to be 
heavily influenced by their eastern neighbor."

WITH LULL IN SIEGE, SARAJEVANS RELISH SUFFERING OF SERB TORMENTORS; BALKANS: 
VISITORS ACROSS FRONT LINES TELL OF DISILLUSIONED FIGHTERS AMONG REBELS, LACK 
OF FREEDOM AND GUN-SLINGING THUGS.

<P>
 After 28 months on the receiving end of a nationalist siege that has shattered 
Sarajevo, survivors like Fatima Veletovac are now relishing a primitive 
pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only happiness is that those thugs in the mountains now have it worse than 
we do," the 36-year-old wife and mother insists with ferocious glee, gesturing 
toward the forested hilltops that shelter Bosnia's rebel Serbs. "I'm glad I 
survived all of this so that I could see them suffer just a part of what they 
put us through." 
</P>
<P>
 Veletovac, a vendor at the capital's central market, describes herself as a 
sympathetic soul usually inclined toward forgiveness. But she admits she is 
currently overcome with zluradost -- an evil happiness spurred by another's 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 As budding signs of life have returned to this city that much of the outside 
world had left for dead, Sarajevans have been surprised and satisfied to learn 
that their tormentors are now paying a price for the misery they have 
inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevans recently allowed to make U.N.-escorted visits to family members 
across the front lines have returned with frightening tales about the 
rebel-held territory, where a political power struggle with neighboring Serbia 
has unleashed tension and fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "My neighbor went to Pale to see his brother last week and came back saying we 
live in paradise by comparison," Veletovac relates in a scandalized tone. "He 
says the people are terrified over there, that the soldiers are drunk and 
morose and get into fights with each other. Everyone is afraid to say anything 
against (Bosnian Serb leader Radovan) Karadzic. We may be ruined on this side, 
but at least I can curse our politicians without having to worry about being 
killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether material life on the Bosnian Serb side of the front line is much worse 
than in Sarajevo is open to question, as few people on either side have work 
that provides them with money. But the recent blockade imposed by Serb-led 
Yugoslavia has caused gasoline and manufactured goods to disappear and prompted 
a state of alert that prohibits cafes from operating. 
</P>
<P>
 What is measurably different, recent visitors say, is the atmosphere and lack 
of freedom. All adult men and women are obliged to serve on work brigades, 
disillusioned fighters drink themselves into oblivion and menace their 
neighbors, and the gun-slinging thugs who protect Karadzic and other leaders 
have generated a fear among the common people akin to that suffered under the 
most ruthless Communist regimes of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serb gunmen who have bombarded this once-elegant European capital 
-- but failed to take it -- appear to be on the run now, having seized more 
land than they can hold and having defied so many foreign-mediated compromises 
that the international community is now leaning toward arming the rebels' 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 While the risk of another escalation in fighting instills fear in some 
Sarajevans, zluradost has perked up others who take pleasure in anticipating a 
comeuppance for the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists say the emotion is a predictable response among victims, and 
believe the misery-loves-company reaction will eventually dissipate as Bosnians 
recover a capacity for empathy that has been damaged by their own suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the moment, they are savoring small expressions of normal life denied 
the rebels: sun-splashed cafes; reopened shops and theaters, and an on-again, 
off-again tram network that generates envy on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N.-brokered pact signed in March by Karadzic and government forces allowed 
Bosnian traders to truck in food and supplies via a dirt track that crosses 
contested Mt. Igman. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooking oil, coffee, canned goods and even designer lingerie are available 
only for hard currency. But the massive imports that took place before Serbian 
gunmen cinched off the so-called Blue Route in early August brought 
astronomical prices down to a level that at least some Sarajevans can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in three years, I can take my children out for ice cream," 
boasts Elvedin Heric, an elementary school principal, settled beneath an 
umbrella at the Egipat outdoor cafe. "The Serbs can see us from the hills, and 
they don't like it that we can sit out and enjoy ourselves while they dig 
trenches." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic mobilized the entire adult population of his occupied territory into 
work brigades last month after Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic announced 
he was cutting all support to the rebels as punishment for their refusal to 
agree to the latest international peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats here and in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, are skeptical 
that Milosevic has completely sealed the border, and journalists who have 
traveled through northern Bosnia report heavy truck traffic by night through 
the supply corridor linking Serbia to Serb-occupied western Bosnia and Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Serbian strongman's public denunciations of the Karadzic regime and 
the genuine disappearance of fuel, at least for public consumption, have 
generated serious concern among the rebels that their military superiority may 
be eroding. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic attributes the rebels' reneging on the 
Blue Route treaty to their growing awareness that the tide of the protracted 
war is turning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Serbs don't want that road open because they see life getting back to 
normal here. They see the cafes open, the trams running, and they're jealous," 
says Silajdzic. "Those on the other side know now that their cause is hopeless. 
Whatever happens to us, they will still be the biggest losers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hints that Serbian gunmen are now paying for their aggression have nurtured a 
collective mood swing that began with the end of heavy artillery shelling in 
February and the first battlefield advances of the Bosnian army this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is on our side now," insists Sasha Zuzo, an expelled Muslim from the 
Serb-held Grbavica neighborhood who recently opened a restaurant in central 
Sarajevo. "While countries like Germany, France and America are conquering the 
world with money and art and industry, the Serbs are still stuck in the Dark 
Ages, using force to make a name for themselves. They are not going to prevail 
in the end, and they know it. We've already won morally, and we have the 
civilized world on our side." 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologist Nijaz Durakovic says the sense of smugness enveloping Sarajevans 
in recent weeks is based mostly on illusion, as few here have jobs, intact 
homes or the wherewithal to survive another winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "But a lot of people are feeling a little more hopeful now that those on the 
other side are seeing their misdeeds come back to haunt them," Durakovic says. 
"There is some kind of pleasurable feeling that, as our saying goes, the bear 
is now dancing at their door." 
</P>
<P>
 The expression is a favorite Balkan equivalent to "What goes around comes 
around," and zluradost is that tee-hee feeling that accompanies getting even.  
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevans' expectations of a change in fortunes have been boosted by U.S. 
politicians' renewed efforts to end an arms embargo that has hamstrung the 
Muslim-led government's defense of its territory. President Clinton has said he 
will push the U.N. Security Council to revoke the ban on weapons sales if the 
Karadzic regime refuses to sign an internationally mediated peace plan by Oct. 
15. 
</P>
<P>
 While the hostile reaction has worsened an already bleak shortage of food and 
utilities for those with no money, it has confirmed Sarajevans' suspicions that 
the insurgents are scared and that their attacks are motivated by envy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People on this side have gotten used to the blockade. It's almost as if they 
have become immune to the hardships," says psychologist Ferid Ovcina. "There 
are many people who have been psychologically damaged by their experiences in 
this war, but a much bigger part of the population has gained strength from it. 
They know they can survive, and they know the other side is now wondering if it 
can."

LIBYAN PARADE MARKS 25-YEAR RULE OF KADAFI 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moammar Kadafi, watching a parade of tanks rumble past, marked 25 years in 
power Thursday with slogans condemning the United States and the U.N. sanctions 
against Libya. 
</P>
<P>
 Kadafi, 52, waved and clasped his hands above his head as soldiers from the 
Green Revolutionary Army chanted about his "Fatah" revolution, meaning the 
"opening" in Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
 While the parade crowd cheered Kadafi, some complained that the U.N. ban on 
flights into and out of Libya was making life difficult. Merchants also offered 
little enthusiasm for celebrating 25 years of Kadafi's rule.

PEREZ VOWS NEW IMAGE FOR PANAMA PARTY; LATIN AMERICA: PRESIDENT SWORN IN, 
PLEDGES TO 'CLOSE THE UNFORTUNATE CHAPTER' OF THE NORIEGA YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ernesto Perez Balladares -- eager to polish the image of his once-disgraced 
political party -- was sworn in Thursday as president of a still-polarized 
Panama and vowed to "close the unfortunate chapter" of the dictatorship of 
Manuel Antonio Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
 The inauguration of Perez, 48, a U.S.-trained banker, marked the return to 
power of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), Noriega's political arm 
until his ouster in a 1989 U.S. military invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perez has sought to portray the Noriega years as an "aberration" and 
claims his party is reformed and committed to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of Noriega's old cronies have roles in the government, however, and 
some diplomats and opposition politicians remain skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his first acts as president, Perez announced pardons for dozens of 
jailed collaborators of the Noriega regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was unclear how extensive the pardons will be -- Perez listed 
several conditions for them -- those in jail include military officers accused 
or convicted of human rights violations and the murders of a priest and one of 
Noriega's harshest critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is critical that we close now the unfortunate chapter of Noriega and the 
persecution that followed the invasion," Perez said after taking the oath of 
office before dignitaries from 40 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 He pledged to avoid the "judicial terrorism" that some members of the PRD feel 
they fell victim to after the invasion and the installation of the right-wing 
government of outgoing President Guillermo Endara. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the PRD's military history -- it was founded by strongman Gen. Omar 
Torrijos, who was killed in a 1981 plane crash -- Perez pledged to build a 
government free of militarism. "This is the new face that Panama is presenting 
to its foreign friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The PRD-dominated national legislature on Thursday also elected Balbina 
Herrera as its president. Herrera, a staunch Noriega ally to the end, was the 
mayor of San Miguelito, a bastion of Noriega support before and after the 
invasion and led demonstrations against then-President George Bush in 1991 that 
turned violent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must hail the Democratic Revolutionary Party, a party that could not be 
destroyed, a party that could not be conquered," she proclaimed in her 
inaugural speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez announced he would increase the size of Panama's police forces, rebuilt 
after the invading American troops dismantled the Panamanian army. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez is also seeking to curry U.S. favor by agreeing to accept up to 10,000 
Cuban refugees. A formal agreement is expected to be announced today. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez won the election May 8, promising to do more for Panama's poor. 
Two-thirds of the electorate voted for other candidates, including salsa star 
and actor Ruben Blades.

U.S. VESSEL ASSISTING REFUGEES APPROACHED BY CUBAN GUNBOATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.S. Coast Guard cutter had a close encounter with a couple of Cuban 
gunboats Thursday as it rescued would-be refugees just outside Cuba's 
territorial waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just 'mess with the Coast Guard,' " said Lt. Steven A. Banks, the 
Monhegan's commanding officer. "It's the first time I know of (Cuban) border 
patrol nearing a Coast Guard vessel." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunboats approached the cutter from behind and came within 200 yards of 
either side. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred in international waters, about 14 1/2 miles off the 
Cuban coast. International law prohibits U.S. boats from entering Cuban waters 
within 12 miles of shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said during a visit 
to Key West that Cuban gunboats had been spotted within the island's 
territorial waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general policy is to sort of stay out of each other's way," Pena said. 
"It's worked thus far." 
</P>
<P>
 The Monhegan, which spent two days in the Straits of Florida plucking hundreds 
of Cubans from the water, had rescued a total of 161 Cubans on Thursday when 
the first Cuban gunboat approached. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monhegan's crew set fire to a raft -- made of inner tubes, wood and a sail 
-- and was preparing to move on when the gunboat sped up and overtook the 
cutter.

<P>
 A camera crew and about a half dozen other people on the gunboat's deck waved 
to the rafters, who waved back after first making profane gestures. The Cubans 
had been ordered to sit low on the deck but stood up as the two 80-foot 
gunboats neared. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're animals," muttered one rafter. 
</P>
<P>
 The first gunboat swerved near the Monhegan again and then proceeded to 
investigate a nearby raft. 
</P>
<P>
 The second gunboat came up on Monhegan's port side. Again, the people on deck 
waved to the rafters, who waved back. That gunboat also went off to investigate 
one of the four rafts within sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just checking us out," said Banks. "If they had had their gun 
covers off, I would have been concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Banks ordered his crew to radio the gunboat to ask its intentions but received 
no reply. He also radioed the Coast Guard's central command to report the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monhegan was ordered to head north before picking up any more rafters, 
even though that meant leaving adrift some rafts which had already been 
spotted. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the 110-foot cutter picked up 288 of the nearly 2,400 Cubans 
found. All were transferred to a Navy ship.

FORMER U.S. DRUG OFFICIALS ADMIT POLICY OVERSIGHTS; ADDICTION: PRESIDENTS' 
ADVISERS SAY THEY FAILED TO ANTICIPATE COCAINE EPIDEMIC AND 'SOFT DRUG' 
DANGERS. BUT OVERALL THEY BELIEVE THEY MADE PROGRESS.

<P>
 A panel of former White House drug czars admitted Thursday to a series of 
oversights in forging national drug policy but said that overall they believe 
each made a difference in the war against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the trends the former high-level advisers said were missed were the 
cocaine epidemic of the 1980s, the dangers posed by marijuana and other 
so-called soft drugs, and the importance of 12-step recovery programs in 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments came during a daylong discussion of White House drug abuse policy 
sponsored by UC San Diego and Scripps Memorial Hospitals. The panel discussion 
brought together for the first time six drug chiefs who served under Presidents 
Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 The current head of the Office of Federal Drug Control Policy, Lee Brown, did 
not attend. Fred Garcia, deputy director of the drug policy office, filled in 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jerome H. Jaffee, the first so-called drug czar, headed the war on drugs 
in the Nixon Administration. He is credited with winning the fight to 
legitimize methadone as a widely available treatment for heroin addiction. 
Experts also generally credit him with setting up programs that reduced heroin 
use among Vietnam veterans in the early and mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jaffee told a group of about 300 drug experts, administrators and students 
that he did not anticipate the big rise in cocaine use.  
</P>
<P>
 As difficult as stemming the tide of heroin abuse was, Jaffee said, it was 
nothing on the scale of the cocaine problem that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were fortunate, perhaps, that the major problem we faced was heroin," 
Jaffee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert L. DuPont, who headed drug policy under Richard Nixon and Gerald R. 
Ford from 1973-75, continued the fight against heroin. But he said that he and 
other drug experts were fooled by marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 DuPont said activist parents of children who were using marijuana forced the 
national drug office to acknowledge the addictive properties of the drug. 
Scientists, DuPont said, "totally blew it with marijuana." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going along with the Establishment view that this was not a problem," 
DuPont said. 
</P>
<P>
 DuPont, along with several other speakers, said that drug experts in general 
did not immediately realize the value of 12-step recovery programs such as 
Alcoholics Anonymous. "The biggest mistake I made was underestimating the full 
dimension of the addiction recovery movement," DuPont said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Peter Bourne, director of drug abuse policy in 1977 and 1978 under Jimmy 
Carter, said he believes that efforts by national drug authorities may have 
also contributed to the spread of crack cocaine. Bourne said that zealous 
efforts by drug officials to stem the tide of cocaine may have inadvertently 
triggered the switch to crack, a cheaper and more available form of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not sure that our own policies didn't contribute to the spread of crack 
cocaine," Bourne said. 
</P>
<P>
 But generally, the former drug chiefs said they believe they made a positive 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 They noted the reduction in the use of heroin and cocaine in the late 1980s 
and efforts at such things as making the public aware of the dangers in soft 
drugs and the abuse of prescription drugs. Several said they believed they 
helped turn around the perceptions that developed during the 1980s that 
so-called recreational drugs, such as cocaine, were safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the former drug czars said that they were alarmed by trends that 
began in the 1980s that saw greater emphasis being placed on drug enforcement 
policies and less on drug treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Herbert Kleber, who headed the drug control policy office under Bush, said 
funding for treatment has "really been a bipartisan failure. We didn't ask for 
enough and Congress gave us even less." 
</P>
<P>
 For the current Administration, Garcia said that President Clinton is 
re-emphasizing drug treatment and education as a way of combatting drug abuse. 
He agreed with other speakers that there has been a tapering off of cocaine and 
heroin use but he said that in the 1990s drug abuse appears to be growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very concerned about the rising numbers," Garcia told the group meeting 
in an auditorium at Scripps. "We may have a new generation of young people 
coming of age who either are not hearing the prevention message or are not 
heeding the message."

ABORTIONS RESUME AT CLINIC WHERE DOCTOR, AIDE WERE SLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Abortion procedures have resumed at The Ladies Center, where a doctor and his 
escort were shot to death in the parking lot in late July. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor whose identity has been kept secret arrived at the clinic early 
Thursday morning to a calm and quiet building. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sharp contrast to the atmosphere that had often greeted Dr. James 
Britton, 69, one of the slaying victims. He had been met by crowds of angry, 
chanting protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinic officials and police said they had done everything possible to keep 
Thursday's activity secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Pensacola police officers, two off-duty police officers hired by the 
clinic and two federal marshals were outside the building in case there were 
problems, police Sgt. Jerry Potts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshals were assigned to some abortion clinics nationwide after Britton was 
murdered and have remained there since. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Hill, 40, an anti-abortion militant, has been charged with murdering 
Britton and James Barrett, 74, his escort, and with wounding Barrett's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the assistant public defender representing Hill has asked a judge 
to dismiss federal charges against his client. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to state murder and attempted murder charges, Hill has been 
charged with three counts of violating the U.S. Freedom of Access to Clinic 
Entrances Act, which prohibits violence, threats and obstructive acts against 
providers of reproductive health services and their patients.

TRIBE ELDERS MEET TO DECIDE YOUTHS' FATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG CONNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Viewed by some as a noble experiment in American justice and by others as an 
elaborate con job, a 12-member tribal court of Tlingit elders met in a remote 
southeast Alaskan fishing village Thursday to decide the fate of two 
17-year-olds returned to their community by a Washington state court. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the tribal court's decisions will be where and how to mete out a penalty 
of banishment to the pair, who savagely beat a Seattle-area pizza deliveryman 
last year -- as well as how the youths and the tribe will make amends to the 
victim. The unusual hearing is likely to last through today. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of Simon P. Roberts and Adrian J. Guthrie, who pleaded guilty to 
robbing Tim Whittlesey of $50 and beating him with a baseball bat in Everett, 
Wash., garnered widespread attention when a Superior Court judge agreed to a 
novel, perhaps unprecedented, arrangement. Instead of sending the teen-agers to 
prison for 2 1/2 to 5 1/2 years, Judge James Allendoerfer said that he would 
postpone sentencing for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, Tlingit elders in southeast Alaska would supervise a 
supposedly traditional punishment of exile to uninhabited islands and 
restitution to the victim. The defense argued that an overwhelmed judicial 
system could never provide this kind of victim assistance and chance at 
rehabilitation. Allendoerfer agreed, ordering the pair back to his court in 
March, 1996, when he will decide whether more punishment is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was the creation of Rudy James, a Tlingit native now living in 
the Seattle area. With a public defender, he argued that banishment was an 
ancient, purifying punishment known to the Tlingits. An anthropologist 
testified that in Tlingit culture, "restoration of peace included the 
banishment of the offender for such a time as the crime demanded." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 James, a member of a Tlingit tribal court, also said that the community would 
assume responsibility for paying restitution to the victim, possibly in the 
form of a new house or in cash. Whittlesey, 25, suffered a concussion in the 
attack and his hearing is permanently damaged. He and his wife are attending 
the tribal proceedings in Klawock, Alaska, having traveled there with James and 
the two convicts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Allendoerfer's decision came under fire from some Snohomish County 
prosecutors, land managers in Alaska and Tlingit officials, who denied that 
James or the tribal court had any authority to speak for the Klawock 
Cooperative Assn., the federally recognized body of the Tlingits. Association 
President Roseann Demmert said: "I think recognition needs to be given to 
traditional ways. I just don't like the way this was done." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, residents of Klawock and other Tlingits say that they have never 
heard of banishment as a method of punishment. Other reports say James owes 
thousands of dollars to several in the Tlingit community, where he and his 
family are sometimes called the "James Gang." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities say they have been approached by tribal officials about 
the prospect of placing the teen-agers on islands under their management. "We 
have serious doubts about whether we could actually do this," said district 
ranger Greg Griffith of the U.S. Forest Service. He said land holdings of 
several native corporations in the area would be more suitable. The proposed 
locale of the banishment areas has not been made public. 
</P>
<P>
 Snohomish County prosecutor Jim Townsend predicted that Guthrie and Roberts 
will flee to Canada, and eventually will be extradited back to Washington state 
at taxpayer expense. "Rudy James is controlling the whole show, and that's a 
bad omen," he said. Prosecutors have filed an appeal, but don't expect it to be 
taken up for at least six weeks.

EPA PROPOSES SHARP CUTBACKS IN TOXINS FROM INCINERATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LEE, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency proposed new rules Thursday requiring 
sharp reductions in the output of dioxin, heavy metals and airborne toxins from 
municipal incinerators nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules, which would take effect a year from now, are designed to achieve 
compliance with the 1990 Clean Air Act, which called on the EPA to place 
stricter controls on stationary sources of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations would require incinerators to install more sophisticated 
pollution prevention equipment and thereby cut overall output of toxic releases 
by 99%. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the proposal calls for an annual reduction of 145,000 tons of toxic 
pollutants from incinerators, including lead, mercury, sulfur dioxide and 
nitrogen dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules would also require substantial reductions in emissions of dioxin, a 
toxic compound that is emitted from incinerators, as well as numerous 
industrial processes, and winds up in the food chain. That recommendation is 
consistent with a draft EPA report, leaked to the media this summer, that 
warned of the dangers dioxin poses to human health and cited incinerators as a 
major source of U.S. dioxin emissions. The emissions are a particular problem 
at medical waste incinerators, EPA sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Incineration is a popular form of waste disposal across the United States. 
About 16% of all municipal waste is burned, compared to 67% that is buried in 
landfills.

247 CASES OF MEASLES IN 10 STATES ARE TRACED TO A SKIER IN COLORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal health officials on Thursday blamed 247 cases of measles in 10 states 
on one skier who spent spring break at a Colorado resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The cases in April and May represent more than one-third -- 36% -- of all 
measles cases in the first half of the year, though it was not the largest-ever 
outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the victims were unvaccinated high school or college students, said 
Dr. Gail King of the CDC's National Immunization Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified skier was probably free of symptoms during a late March 
vacation at Breckenridge, Colo., but passed the highly contagious disease to 
five others among the vacation crowd of 25,000, including a 14-year-old 
Illinois girl whose family follows Christian Science, a religion that shuns 
medical care, including inoculations. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl spread the disease to 51 people in her hometown of Elsah, Ill., near 
St. Louis, and started an outbreak that hit 156 people at her boarding school, 
The Principia, a 96-year-old school for Christian Scientists in a St. Louis 
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 The outbreak eventually spread to Texas, Maine, California, New York, 
Washington, Maryland, Michigan, Colorado and Missouri as vacationing skiers 
returning home infected family and friends who were not vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
 King expected no new measles cases from the outbreak. "The chain that started 
in Breckenridge has ended," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though usually benign, measles can be fatal.

U.S. JUDGE OKS $4.25-BILLION BREAST IMPLANT SETTLEMENT; LAW: PACT IS LARGEST 
PRODUCT-LIABILITY AGREEMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. CRITICS SAY THERE ISN'T ENOUGH 
MONEY TO PAY THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge granted final approval Thursday to a $4.25-billion pact between women 
and makers of breast implants, the largest product-liability settlement in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by U.S. District Judge Sam Pointer cleared the way for 
court-appointed administrators to begin determining whether there is enough 
money to pay the claims of thousands of women. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics contend that as much as $200 billion is needed to adequately 
compensate implant recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that anyone at this point thinks the $4.25 billion is going to 
be enough, me included," said Ralph Knowles, an attorney who negotiated on 
behalf of the women. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement involves nearly 60 companies that manufactured implants or 
components of implants. Dow Corning Corp. agreed to pay $2 billion, the largest 
share of the agreement. The companies admitted no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the order, the companies must make initial payments of more than $900 
million in mid-October, provided no appeals are filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for women in other countries objected to the implant settlement, 
claiming too little money was set aside for them. In answer to those 
objections, Pointer increased the amount of money set aside for foreign women 
from about $81 million to $96.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the order, U.S. women with certain diseases will get payments ranging 
from $105,000 to $1.4 million, depending on their age and health. Foreign women 
will get 40% to 90% of the amounts granted U.S. women, depending on where they 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90,500 women have made claims, including 500 from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15,000 women, including about half of those living outside the United 
States, have already rejected the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Payments could be reduced if officials determine there is not enough money to 
cover all the claims. Women would have a chance to reject the settlement and 
pursue individual lawsuits if that occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement was reached in April after nearly two years of negotiations 
between women's attorneys and U.S. implant manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest previous product-liability settlement was a $3-billion trust 
established by the Manville Corp. to pay claims stemming from exposure to 
asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased the proposed global settlement has moved to this next step and 
that the court has ruled positively as to the fairness of the settlement," Dow 
Corning spokesman Michael Jackson said from company headquarters in Midland, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 But implant recipient Barbara Herzog of Lakeview, Pa., said she wants more 
than a check. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They have made nothing remotely resembling an apology. Women would still like 
that very much," Herzog said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Armstrong, a spokeswoman for the National Breast Implant Plaintiffs' 
Coalition, said members are watching to see if the judge follows through on 
promises to keep lawyers' fees and administrative costs at $1 billion. Pointer 
also has said he wanted the sickest women to get money first. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he does those two things, he will historically change the way class 
actions are perceived," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Women face a Sept. 16 deadline for applying to be in the first wave of 
payments, which could be made as early as next spring. Pointer gave them an 
additional month, until Oct. 17, to file medical documents supporting their 
claims. Payments by Major Companies 
</P>
<P>
 The $4.25-billion breast implant settlement approved Thursday calls on the 
former major manufacturers of the silicone devices to contribute the following 
sums: 
</P>
<P>
 Dow Corning: $2.02 billion 
</P>

FEDERAL PANEL WITHHOLDS APPROVAL OF BREAST EXAM DEVICE; HEALTH: FDA'S OUTSIDE 
EXPERTS CALL FOR STUDIES THAT SHOW THE SENSOR PAD WORKS. THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN 
AT THE CENTER OF A LONG LEGAL BATTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended Thursday that the 
agency not approve the Sensor Pad, an experimental device designed to help 
women better detect breast lumps during self-examination, until its 
manufacturer submits scientific studies that show the product works. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, the panel of outside experts sided with the agency in its 
nine-year dispute with the company that makes the device, a controversy that 
has involved FDA seizures of the product for illegal marketing to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 When placed over the breast, the pad -- made of two latex-like sheets with a 
liquid silicone lubricant in-between -- is supposed to enhance its tactile 
surface, much like using soap or body lotion, presumably making lumps easier to 
feel. 
</P>
<P>
 It is expected to cost about $15 and, if approved, likely would be available 
without a prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 It is available in Europe and Asia, but its status in the United States has 
been held up by the device industry as a case study of the FDA's sluggishness 
in approving potentially lifesaving medical devices. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FDA, which in recent years has sought to achieve a balance between 
speeding promising products to the market and protecting the public from 
injury, has refused to approve the product until the manufacturer submits 
evidence that it is effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Breast cancer, the second-leading cancer killer of women, results in about 
46,000 deaths annually. There are about 182,000 new cases every year. Early 
detection of the disease is considered critical. 
</P>
<P>
 The pad's manufacturer, Inventive Products Inc., of Decatur, Ill., has argued 
that the pad is intended as an adjunct to -- not a substitute for -- 
traditional methods of breast cancer detection and that it is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, the manufacturer has said, the FDA should not view it with the same 
regulatory scrutiny as devices such as heart valves or intrauterine devices, 
which in some cases have resulted in injury and deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 But agency officials fear, among other things, that the pad could either mask 
abnormalities or cause women to feel something that is not there, resulting in 
undue anxiety and unnecessary medical procedures. Also, they worry that women 
who use it might forgo conventional breast cancer detection methods, such as 
mammograms or physical exams by physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the importance of early detection . . , the public health implications 
are obvious," said Dr. Susan Alpert, director of the FDA's Office of Device 
Evaluation. "Are our concerns warranted, or are we being overly cautious? If 
this device is safe and useful . . , we want it to reach the public." 
</P>
<P>
 The company provided the panel and the agency with testimony from numerous 
clinicians and women praising the pad, but it never has conducted extensive 
clinical trials that compare breast examination with and without the pad. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no good way to do a human trial (because) there are so many 
variables in breast self-examination" that "you can't come out with good, clean 
science," said Grant Wright, president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're up here trying to do some good," he added. "I lost an aunt to breast 
cancer and another aunt underwent a mastectomy. We want to work with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the FDA's obstetrics and gynecology devices panel urged that 
studies be conducted in professional settings, such as hospitals and clinics, 
using both physicians and patients to compare breast examinations with and 
without the pad. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also recommended behavioral studies to determine whether use of 
the product resulted in changes in women's practices, either in 
self-examination or other detection methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Wright, the product's inventor and father of the company's president, 
said he does not know whether the company will comply, but he expressed 
pessimism about the prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each woman's breast is unique and there's no way trials could be set up using 
women that would be scientific," he said. "For nine years we've heard the same 
arguments and we've never come up with a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the firm began selling the pad to hospitals illegally, which led to a 
series of seizures by the FDA. When the firm contested the original seizure, a 
federal court upheld the FDA actions. The company appealed the ruling, 
contending that the product was not a medical device. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, a federal appeals court affirmed the original ruling that the pad was 
a medical device and that it could not be sold until it was licensed. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the initial seizure and throughout the legal process, the firm 
continued to distribute the device and the agency continued to seize it. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm first sought marketing approval in 1985, saying that the device was 
essentially equivalent to products that were already legally on the market, in 
effect seeking to bypass agency requirements that it submit proof of safety and 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA concluded that the device was not like anything on the market and that 
a full pre-market approval application, including evidence of safety and 
effectiveness, was required. 
</P>
<P>
 The company submitted such an application in 1989, but the FDA said it 
contained little information and was inadequate to determine safety and 
effectiveness.

TEXAS CANDIDATE PICKS WRONG TARGET AT HUNT

<P>
 Republican gubernatorial candidate George W. Bush hammered Gov. Ann Richards 
on crime Thursday, then inadvertently broke the law by shooting a killdeer bird 
on the first day of dove hunting season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a dove." the son of former President George Bush said. A 
spokesman said Bush would be fined $130. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the trip, Bush took aim at the Democratic governor, contending a new 
penal code she signed that took effect Thursday actually reduces prison time. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards, who has made a tradition of dove hunting on the first day of the 
season, said the code doubles the minimum sentence for violent offenders.

LINDSAY ANDERSON; ENGLISH FILM DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lindsay Anderson, Academy Award-winning documentarian, writer and director who 
prided himself on low-budget, thought-provoking films, has died in Europe. He 
was 71. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson died Tuesday, reportedly of a heart attack suffered as he was 
climbing out of a friend's swimming pool in France. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the Oscar in 1954 for a documentary, "Thursday's Children." 
</P>
<P>
 A man of few films, Anderson is probably best remembered for his first 
feature-length effort, "This Sporting Life" in 1963, and for "If," which won 
the Palme d'Or in Cannes in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 He received his best reviews for the 1987 film, "The Whales of August," 
starring two of the industry's grande dames, Lillian Gish and Bette Davis. 
"They were both quite remarkable," he told The Times later. "And, truthfully, I 
was more struck by their vitality than their ages. They're both extraordinary 
women. Lillian just plumps up her hair and gets on with it. Bette tends to take 
more time with her makeup. But she's not concerned with looking good -- only 
with being in character." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's other popular features were "The White Bus" in 1967 and "O Lucky 
Man!" in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Once questioned about making only six feature-length films over 20 years, the 
perfectionist responded: "Oh, really? I think it's a lot!" 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson also directed television shows, including several episodes of "The 
Adventures of Robin Hood," and theater, serving as artistic director of 
London's Royal Court Theatre from 1969 to 1975. He also wrote two books, 
"Making a Film" in 1951 and a biography of his directing idol, "About John 
Ford," in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 He was one of five filmmakers asked to create a semi-autobiographical film for 
a BBC series called "The Director's Place." His film will launch the series 
Sept. 17.

SACRAMENTO FILE: BILL TO AID HOME POLICYHOLDERS AFTER A DISASTER SENT TO WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate has passed and sent to Gov. Pete Wilson a so-called "homeowners' 
bill of rights" designed to offer increased protection to policyholders whose 
homes are damaged by earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 A 22-14 vote near the end of the legislative session sent the bill (SB 1355) 
by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) to the governor. It previously passed the 
Assembly by a 44-34 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the measure's provisions would require insurers to notify homeowners of 
their rights immediately after a natural disaster and tell them what their 
agents and adjusters can and cannot do. 
</P>
<P>
 Another provision would require homeowner insurance policies to be written in 
plain English that is easy to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said some victims of natural disasters have been forced to wait up to 
four years for insurance settlements to rebuild their homes and lives. ASSEMBLY

NARCOTICS LINK IN COLOSIO'S DEATH DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The attorney general's office Thursday played down allegations by a former 
justice official that the assassination of a presidential candidate in March 
may have been entangled in a web of drugs and politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement responding to testimony given by Eduardo Valle Espinosa to 
Mexican authorities last month at a closed-door hearing in Washington, the 
office of Atty. Gen. Humberto Benitez Trevino said Valle had provided no proof 
of his key allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle, formerly a senior aide in the attorney general's office, has said he 
has evidence that local drug lords tied to Colombia's Cali cartel have 
infiltrated the upper reaches of Mexican politics and may have masterminded the 
killing of ruling party candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there is a "concrete possibility" that officials being paid by Mexican 
cocaine kingpin Juan Garcia Abrego helped plan and carry out the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office stated Thursday that Valle "said there were 
several grave deficiencies in the security organization of the candidate 
Colosio, without providing any proof that would back his allegations or show 
any responsibility of the citizens he has mentioned."

PROTESTANT EXTREMISTS MAY BE KEY TO ULSTER PEACE; EUROPE: FEARFUL THAT THE IRA 
GOT CONCESSIONS FOR ITS NORTHERN IRELAND TRUCE, MILITANTS COULD CONTINUE 
VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As residents of Northern Ireland enjoyed the first day of an Irish Republican 
Army cease-fire Thursday, attention began to focus on Protestant extremist 
forces who have threatened to torpedo peace efforts in the province by 
accelerating their own campaign of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's IRA announcement of a "complete cessation" of violence constituted 
the biggest single step toward peace in the beleaguered region since the latest 
round of unrest began 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It also left Protestant extremist groups as the lone remaining elements with a 
potential to continue a sustained campaign of violence in the province, also 
known as Ulster. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the past three years, more people have been killed in Ulster by 
outlawed Protestant paramilitary groups than by the IRA. So far this year, of 
55 deaths attributed to the sectarian warfare, 32 have been carried out by 
Protestant groups, according to British government figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that the IRA gained important, secret concessions from the British 
and Irish governments in return for their cease-fire, these Protestant 
extremists believe their interests may be served by trying to scuttle the peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these groups, the Ulster Volunteer Force, shot a 37-year-old Catholic 
man in Northern Ireland within hours of the IRA's announcement. And Thursday 
night, a gunman killed a 22-year-old Catholic in Belfast. They were the latest 
victims in a conflict that has claimed more than 3,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Those familiar with these Protestant extremist groups believe their ability to 
carry out threats of stepped-up violence are largely tied to the reaction of 
Ulster's Protestant population, which remains confused and uncertain in the 
wake of recent events. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take a few days for these views to shake out," said David McKittrick, 
one of the most respected analysts on Ulster affairs, who writes for the London 
daily Independent. "People in that community are fairly anxious and tense. If 
the British government comes out with a string of concessions to (the IRA) 
immediately, it could influence the mood." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, at least, moderate Protestant political leaders appear to be 
willing to offer cautious support for the move toward the peace table while 
radicals, such as Ian Paisley, have denounced it as a plot. 
</P>
<P>
 One influential Protestant leader, Belfast Mayor Hugh Smyth, appealed Thursday 
for moderation. "I would simply ask the (Protestant) paramilitaries to play it 
calm, to examine the (IRA) statement and, if they are assured there's been no 
sellout, then I hope they can take the next step and perhaps announce their own 
cease-fire," Symth said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the majority of the massive government security force in Northern Ireland 
now free from the task of tracking the IRA, militant Protestant groups are 
expected to come under increased pressure. To survive, they would require the 
active sympathy of the Protestant community. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sign of the changing times, roadblocks long operated by security forces 
in the IRA heartland of West Belfast had largely disappeared Thursday morning, 
while troops were deployed to guard Roman Catholic political organizations from 
possible attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulster's Protestants tend to carry the political description of loyalist, for 
their desire to retain British rule, which they see as the sole guarantor of 
their way of life. Northern Ireland's minority Roman Catholics have 
traditionally sympathized with the goal of bringing Ulster into a united 
Ireland, although they have differed sharply in the role that violence should 
play in that effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, events Thursday merely underscored how politically difficult the 
road to peace in Northern Ireland is likely to be for all parties. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, some members of Prime Minister John Major's Conservative Party 
expressed outrage at reports that within 24 hours of the IRA cease-fire, four 
IRA prisoners had been transferred from jails in Britain to Ulster, including 
Patrick Magee, who was implicated in the 1984 bombing of a Brighton Hotel that 
nearly wiped out the entire British Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Although British officials insisted that the shift had been arranged months 
ago and was only coincidentally completed Thursday, the incident was an 
embarrassment to Major and is likely to unsettle Protestant opinion in the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
 But Major drew some consolation from statements by senior members of Sinn 
Fein, the IRA political wing, that seemed to go at least part way toward 
meeting his demand for assurances that ambiguous wording in Wednesday's 
cease-fire statement meant a permanent renunciation of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a radio interview Thursday, Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's 
executive committee, said the announcement meant a cease-fire "under all 
circumstances," while party leader Gerry Adams said that Irish Prime Minister 
Albert Reynolds had correctly interpreted the IRA wording. Reynolds hailed the 
cease-fire as the beginning of a new era.

DEFENSE MUST REVEAL WHAT'S IN ENVELOPE; SIMPSON CASE: JUDGE ITO ORDERS DEFENSE 
TO TELL PROSECUTORS ABOUT THE CONTENTS AND PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS. BUT OTHER 
INFORMATION MAY BE WITHHELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The defense in the O.J. Simpson case was ordered Thursday to disclose to 
prosecutors the contents of a mysterious envelope and a criminalist's analysis 
of its condition. 
</P>
<P>
 But a cryptic written order by Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito did not 
mention turning over the evidence and said the defense could continue to keep 
secret the first report on the matter, which may have disclosed where the 
contents were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito ordered the disclosure of two reports: one written Aug. 22 by retired 
Superior Court Judge Delbert E. Wong, who was appointed as a special master to 
handle the evidence; and another by criminalist David M. Sugiyama written the 
same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola University law professor Laurie Levenson said the obliquely worded 
order means that prosecutors do not get their hands on the evidence because of 
possible risk of contamination. But they will have reports telling them exactly 
what is inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means that the prosecution will be told through reports the contents of 
the envelope. But they won't get the report on where it was found," Levenson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said that the defense had demonstrated good cause to delay release 
of the first report on the matter written by Wong on July 1. It apparently 
contains details of how the evidence in the envelope was found and where it was 
located. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling, the judge cited a new California law dealing with reciprocal 
discovery and the determination of what defense lawyers must disclose to 
prosecutors before trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge had insisted upon seeing the prosecution's witness list before 
making his ruling. In a footnote, he said that the law requires the defense to 
disclose only witnesses and statements it will use to refute prosecution 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, 47, has pleaded not guilty to the June 12 murders of his ex-wife, 
Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman, 25, outside 
Nicole Simpson's Brentwood condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 In grand jury proceedings Thursday, a mysterious witness who said his life was 
in danger was held in contempt of court after refusing to testify before the 
panel investigating Simpson's friend and getaway driver Al (A.C.) Cowlings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does not know O.J. or Al Cowlings or anyone in their camp," said attorney 
Robert Rentzer, whose client identified himself to Associated Press as John 
Dunton. 
</P>
<P>
 Rentzer refused to say what information Dunton has, but "his information is 
not firsthand information. . . . This is tangential and remote." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said Dunton was held in contempt after he refused to answer four 
questions posed by grand jurors. An appeal was planned.

 Superior Court Judge Stephen Czulegar gave Dunton until Wednesday to resolve 
the appeal or go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is in fear for his life if he reveals any information, and he wants it 
publicly known that he will not reveal information even if it means going into 
custody," Rentzer told reporters outside the grand jury hearing room. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement to the grand jury, Dunton suggested the district attorney had 
broken a promise not to call him as a witness "or otherwise make use of 
information supplied by me to the district attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury is investigating the role Cowlings played in Simpson's getaway 
June 17, the day Simpson was supposed to surrender. Instead, Cowlings drove 
Simpson on a three-county, slow-speed freeway chase that ended back at 
Simpson's estate. Cowlings' attorney has said his client was trying to save 
Simpson, who planned to commit suicide at Nicole Simpson's grave.

SOME DISTRICTS TO TRIM FUNDING FOR GIFTED STUDENTS; EDUCATION: THE BUDGETS ARE 
ALREADY MEAGER. THE MOST SWEEPING CHANGES ARE PLANNED FOR VENTURA UNIFIED. 
</P>

 Threatened with state budget cuts last spring, Ventura County school officials 
have been girding for reductions of up to 25% in their programs for gifted 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Now state education officials say funding for gifted education will be about 
the same this year as last. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Ventura County school districts still plan to trim their already 
meager budgets for teaching exceptionally bright children. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, Conejo Unified School District officials said they expect to 
cut back purchase of classroom materials and possibly eliminate extra training 
for teachers of gifted children. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai school officials also said they will be buying far fewer instructional 
materials -- such as robotics kits and microscopes -- for their Gifted and 
Talented Education program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're running a tight ship," Ojai's Director of Special Education Marty 
Babayco said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most sweeping changes are planned in the Ventura Unified School 
District, which has one of the most costly gifted programs in the county and 
must cut expenses regardless of state funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's gifted elementary schoolchildren stay in regular classrooms every 
day except one morning each week, when they are bused to other campuses for 
courses in computers, archeology and other challenging subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although popular with parents, the costs of busing the students and paying 
three teachers who run the special classes eat up half of the district's 
$94,000 GATE budget, said Margaret Gosfield, the district's gifted program 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 That is too much, she said, because fewer than one-third of the district's 900 
GATE students are elementary age. 
</P>
<P>
 So by next fall the program, which has been run unchanged for two decades, 
will be revamped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A less costly option is to place all gifted elementary students in the same 
classes, segregated from children who have not qualified for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some county school districts, such as Oxnard Elementary and Simi 
Valley Unified, already put their gifted elementary school students into 
separate classes, Gosfield said such methods have sometimes been criticized as 
elitist. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Gosfield said the Ventura district must consider all options 
because of cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the funding continues as is, there's no way we can afford to have these 
teachers," Gosfield said. "It's not a question of wanting to or not wanting 
to." The current special weekly courses cover subjects that are not normally 
taught in regular third- through fifth-grade elementary school classrooms, 
Gosfield said. "They have done everything from archeology to space and flight 
and geometry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's funding for gifted education has slowly dropped over the past 
several years from $104,000 to $94,000, with most of the money going to pay the 
salaries of Gosfield and the three teachers and for busing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some county districts such as Moorpark kick in their own money for 
gifted education programs, most are like Ventura and pay for them solely with 
state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being expensive, Gosfield said Ventura's gifted students may need more 
extra attention than they get through the one special course per week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gifted children are gifted every day, not just on Tuesday," Gosfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 And some Ventura parents acknowledge that the change may be an improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children who are gifted need to spend time with other gifted children," said 
Kathy Neprud, leader of a parent group that raises money for gifted education. 
"They need to be challenged and they need to spend time with their peers. If 
they don't have time with children who are thinking at higher levels as they 
are, they either shut down those parts of themselves or they become 
troublemakers in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Conejo district, administrator Linda Calvin said she also worries that 
the state will continue to cut GATE funding because of the mistaken assumption 
that bright children do not need special attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The attitude is, Calvin said, "that gifted students have no needs and they'll 
make it on their own without any help at all. And that's a fallacious 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo receives about $125,000 in state funds for a program serving 1,200 
gifted children. 
</P>
<P>
 At the elementary schools, small groups of gifted students are clustered 
together in regular classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin said she is concerned that if teachers in such classrooms do not get 
extra training, they will not know how to intellectually challenge these groups 
of bright students. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens is the teaching, while it may be very good, will tend to move 
toward the middle or the median of the classroom," she said.

2 MORE COUNTY FIRE STATIONS ARE BURGLARIZED; CRIME: NEWBURY PARK AND SIMI 
VALLEY FACILITIES ARE LATEST VICTIMS. DETECTIVES THINK THE THIEF MAY BE SOMEONE 
WITHIN THE SYSTEM. 
</P>

 Two more Ventura County fire stations have been burglarized while fire crews 
were away on a call, and the focus of the criminal investigation is narrowing 
to someone who knows department procedures, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that it's either an ex- or a current employee," said Sgt. Harold 
Humphries of the county Sheriff's Department, referring to the rash of petty 
burglaries that date back to at least February. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Detective Stan Weber, a lead investigator in the case, said as many 
as 12 stations throughout the county have been hit, some more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 He said firefighters in Simi Valley, Ojai, Santa Paula, Thousand Oaks, 
Moorpark and Camarillo, among other communities, have been victimized. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest thefts occurred Wednesday night, one at a Newbury Park station 
about 10:35 p.m. and another in Simi Valley about an hour later. Those 
incidents bring to at least 17 the number of burglaries that have occurred 
while firefighters were out, at least six times on false alarms, Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the crimes involve only petty cash, and in none of the cases was 
there evidence that the thief had broken in, Weber said. He estimated the total 
loss in all 17 cases between $1,000 and $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to have a meeting with department heads to find out how 
to stop this," the detective said. "A lot of the brass are just getting aware 
of how big this is." 
</P>
<P>
 As word of the burglaries spreads, fire officials have tightened security at 
the 30 stations throughout the county -- from assuring that they remain locked 
while firefighters are on call, to changing the access codes that unlock their 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the burglaries have continued, leading detectives to suspect the 
burglaries are inside jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have to be somebody within the system who knows the codes when they 
change," Sgt. Humphries said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Chief Jim Sewell, who joined the department Aug. 22, said fire 
officials have not determined conclusively if an employee is involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't eliminated it but we haven't focused on it," he said. "It's 50-50 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 As in two other station burglaries in Thousand Oaks, the first one Wednesday 
involved a false call made to Station 32 at 830 S. Reino Road. Capt. Murph 
Walshe said the call concerned a tennis player with a broken ankle at nearby 
Borchard Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But firefighters found no injured tennis player. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the three-man crew was away only about 10 minutes, they later found 
about $60 in cash missing from a locker, which was broken into with a bolt 
cutter, Walshe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Weber said the locker, the only one that had been broken into, was 
where firefighters had kept their soft-drink money. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the thief seemed to know where to go. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second theft Wednesday, Station 43 at 1262 Cypress St. in Simi Valley 
was burglarized of $75 to $80, said firefighter Rick Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the crew had been summoned to help Los Angeles County firefighters 
battle a blaze about 11 p.m., approximately 20 minutes after the Newbury Park 
crew returned to its station. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Simi Valley firefighters were called off by Los Angeles County about 
40 minutes later, before they got to the fire, he said. The theft was not 
discovered until Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky," Bell said. "I happened to hide my wallet in my dirty clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar to the burglary at the Newbury Park station, which Capt. Walshe said 
has been hit three times now, were two thefts in Thousand Oaks. Both of those 
involved calls that a motorcyclist had been injured and both, Weber said, 
turned out to be false. 
</P>
<P>
 In yet another case, the crew at Station 25 at Seacliff on Pacific Coast 
Highway was summoned Aug. 10 to a garbage bin fire at the beachside campground 
at Faria County Park, Capt. Terry Tyner said. No fire was found and 
firefighters later found their soft-drink money was missing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be (an inside job)," Weber said. "It obviously looks that way, like 
somebody who knows procedures, and how to get into stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had thought these had all stopped," he added. "He sounds to me like he's 
pretty brave. I don't know if he doesn't read the paper, or if he even cares, 
but this guy is fast, really fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Weber said Crime Stoppers, a nonprofit community organization, has offered a 
reward of up to $1,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of 
the burglar. Callers can remain anonymous.

MANAGER OF LANDFILLS BUYS ADJACENT LAND; SANITATION: FARMLAND NEXT TO BAILARD 
AND COASTAL DUMPS IS ACQUIRED BY THE AGENCY TO AVOID A SUIT ON METHANE 
DEPOSITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The agency that manages Bailard and Coastal landfills has paid $1.3 million 
for 53 acres of farmland adjacent to the dumps to avoid being sued over methane 
gas detected beneath the property two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one year ago, the same property was considered a prime site for a park 
with bike trails and lakes. But officials at the Ventura Regional Sanitation 
District now say they have no plans to transform the landfills and farmland 
into a regional park for the Oxnard area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The park idea is dead on the part of the district," said Camarillo 
Councilwoman Charlotte Craven, who is also a sanitation district director. "If 
it were ever to come forward, it would probably be after the (Bailard) landfill 
closed. And it would have to come out of a conservancy or the county recreation 
department." 
</P>
<P>
 The land on both sides of Victoria Avenue at the Santa Clara River will serve 
as a buffer around both dumps, protecting the regional sanitation district and 
local cities from liability because of methane gas seepage. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition also ensures that the district will not be forced to settle 
lawsuits from claims already filed by the former farmland owners -- Ag Land 
Services and the Ida Swift Trust, district lawyer Mark Zirbel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal claim filed by the trust cited the presence of dangerous levels of 
methane gas on the farmland border in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Zirbel said a complex gas extraction system at the Coastal Landfill was shut 
down during that time as the district sealed off the dump as part of a 
multiyear closure process. Once the methane pumping system was turned back on, 
the gas stopped migrating under the farmland, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers of the Ida Swift Trust also complained about poor drainage on their 
property because of the Bailard Landfill, and damage to agricultural crops by 
thousands of sea gulls hovering over the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The onslaught of sea gulls sits on fields when they're freshly planted and 
then the seeds won't come through," trust attorney Allen Camp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zirbel said the sanitation district bought the 53 acres in late July after 
Camp approached the board of directors and offered a good price. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our expectation was that they would press their litigation and there would 
have been some kind of cost for defense, and we likely would have had to make 
some settlement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the district's board approved the use of operating funds to cover 
part of the cost of the purchase until a reserve fund is replenished with money 
from dumping fees. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the 53 acres will continue to be used by a vegetable grower, who 
leases the land for $24,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for turning both dumps into a regional park surfaced in spring, 1993, 
as the sanitation district sought to extend the life of the Bailard Landfill to 
May, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailard Landfill -- which takes in about 1,000 tons of trash a day -- had been 
set to close last December. A three-year extension was granted in June by a 
state rubbish board, despite protests from some neighbors. Some Oxnard 
officials had supported the extension but only if they got a park in return. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the abandonment of the park proposal has left its supporters 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a natural thing for them to do, to renege on what they had promised 
the city of Oxnard," said Supervisor John K. Flynn, who voted not to extend the 
life of the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oxnard residents want the Bailard Landfill to look good when (the district) 
leaves it," he said. Grass-seeding programs are not enough, he said. "It's 
going to look pretty terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Craven said the district's board of directors decided not to consider a park 
-- at least until Bailard closes -- because the construction would have 
required charging cities higher dumping fees and conducting an extensive 
environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just more than any of us wanted to get into," Craven said.

SALE OF COLLEGE HORSES LEGAL, REPORT STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is no evidence of theft or wrongdoing related to the sale of horses left 
over from the defunct equine program at Moorpark College, an independent probe 
released Thursday concluded. And the district attorney's office has dropped its 
investigation into the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 But college district officials said the investigation failed to address a 
number of concerns, including former program director Don Anderson's incomplete 
bookkeeping and why he settled on apparently low prices for some animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, prepared last month by a private investigator, said Anderson 
disposed of the college-owned horses the same way he had for years: by selling 
them to people he knew would provide good homes for the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, the longtime director of the Moorpark College Equine Program, put 
proceeds back into the program to keep it afloat because the college could not 
afford to increase funding, the investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not find any evidence that Mr. Anderson acted in an illegal manner with 
intent to defraud the college," William Hansen wrote in his report to Thomas G. 
Lakin, chancellor of the Ventura County Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 "He merely attempted to close down the program in the same manner as he had 
operated it for some 25-26 years -- by making personal decisions which he 
believed were in the best interest of the college," concluded Hansen, who was 
paid $2,600 for his weeklong investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of the report was forwarded to the Ventura County district attorney's 
office, which had been looking into the transactions. But Dist. Atty. Michael 
D. Bradbury announced Thursday that he was dropping the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have closed our file on the matter," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The equine program shut down last June after Anderson retired. Over the last 
year, Anderson was instructed to dismantle the program, but was given no 
specific directions from college or district officials, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson made arrangements to sell the horses to a variety of buyers he said 
would pay a fair-market price for the animals and provide them safe homes, the 
investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anderson never obtained direct permission to sell the animals from college 
district trustees, who are bound by the state education code to dispose of 
surplus property by auctioning it off to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 horses were accounted for at the Rancho Sierra Vista facility in 
Newbury Park earlier this year. Later, however, more than a dozen horses turned 
up missing or already sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees opted to sell the 23 remaining horses at auction, but only under 
certain conditions designed to weed out horse meat dealers who would sell the 
animals to be used in dog food.  
</P>
<P>
 The auction generated more than $11,000 -- well above Anderson's appraisal of 
$300 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark College President James Walker was pleased that the investigation was 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm relieved, frankly," he said. "I'm happy to put any matter behind me that 
has been a great consumer of time and energy on the part of many people at the 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vice Chancellor Jerry D. Pauley said the investigation merely concludes 
what many suspected for months: "That we would wind up finding (the program) 
was probably operated inappropriately," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it is questionable whether there was any intent to defraud the district 
of any property," Pauley added. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Karen M. Boone, who has been the most vocal board member in 
criticizing the handling of the horses, also said Thursday that Hansen's report 
is incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still some unexplained things here," she said. "He doesn't go into 
anything as far as the managerial problems. I'll be sure and bring that up at 
the board meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Erich, a Port Hueneme attorney who sought and eventually won the 
right to bid on the 23 animals, said Thursday that the report does not address 
Anderson's under-valuations of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was finding good homes for the horses, perhaps, but they weren't 
necessarily providing a good income to the college," said Erich, who purchased 
two horses. "I still question whether he was acting in the best interest of the 
taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Erich said one horse she bought with a $50 bid was later valued at $800 by an 
independent appraiser.

METROLINK'S FAIR RIDERSHIP DECLINES; TRANSPORTATION: NEARLY A THIRD FEWER 
PATRONS USED THE TRAINS THIS YEAR. DECLINE IN EVENT'S OVERALL ATTENDANCE IS 
BLAMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ridership on special weekend Metrolink trains to the Ventura County Fair fell 
by nearly a third this year, disappointing transportation officials and leaving 
a $5,000 operating deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Over two August weekends, Metrolink carried about 21,000 passengers to the 
fair in Ventura, down from 30,000 during last summer's inaugural county fair 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lower ridership is a disappointment," said Simi Valley Councilman Bill 
Davis, who serves on the Ventura County Transportation Commission. "I think we 
were so high on the big turnout last year that we just expected it to happen 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis blamed the drop in ridership partly on a 10% decline in overall fair 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have less people going to the fair, you have less people taking the 
train to get there," said Davis, who represents Ventura County on the board of 
the Southern California Regional Rail Authority, which operates Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the Metrolink riders boarded in Simi Valley, 25% in Moorpark, 20% 
in Camarillo and 5% in Oxnard, said Mary Travis, transit coordinator for the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating a jump in ridership, the commission earlier this summer agreed to 
increase the number of daily Metrolink runs to the fair from four to six and 
added extra train cars, nearly tripling the budget for the fair train to 
$49,000. 
</P>
<P>
 About 16,000 paying passengers and 5,000 children under age 5 and other 
non-paying passengers rode the trains to the fair this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Train ticket sales this year will cover all but the $5,000 deficit, which will 
be paid by the fair board, Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement is that we give our time, energy and support and the fair board 
pays the extra costs," Travis said. "It's really a promotion for the fair, so 
they've agreed to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 For last year's Metrolink service to the fair, transportation officials 
initially claimed that an estimated 35,000 passengers crowded onto the trains, 
but the actual number of riders last year was probably closer to 30,000, Travis 
said. About 23,000 of those riders were paying passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair spokeswoman Teri Raley said the train service attracts fair-goers who 
might not otherwise attend the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "The train is good publicity for the fair and the fair brings good publicity 
for the train," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular weekday Metrolink service to Simi Valley and Moorpark began nearly two 
years ago. Service to Camarillo and Oxnard was added after the Jan. 17 
earthquake to help get commuters out of their cars and ease congestion on 
damaged freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 Ventura County commuters take the train to the San Fernando Valley 
and Los Angeles each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the drop in ridership for the special weekend fair service, Davis said 
he expects the Transportation Commission to continue running Metrolink trains 
to the fair. In fact, Davis said, the commission later this year may consider 
starting summer weekend train service from the east county to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who do take it really do enjoy it," he said. "It's a good way to 
get to the fair and a good way to promote the train."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MAN, 31, ACCUSED OF PEEKING IN WINDOW

<P>
 A 31-year-old Ventura man has been arrested on suspicion of peeking through a 
woman's bedroom window and is under investigation as a suspect in a series of 
prowler-related crimes, Ventura Police Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 John W. Maass was booked Wednesday at Ventura County Jail on suspicion of 
peeking and possession of burglary tools after officers observed him peering 
into a 25-year-old woman's Ventura apartment, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've known that this was happening," Officer Rick French said. "It's been 
something we've been looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 While on surveillance Wednesday morning, Officer Mark Coronado saw a man 
approaching a bedroom window near Hill and Webster streets -- an area where 
many prowlers have been reported, police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man appeared to be manipulating the blinds through the window screen with 
an object, which authorities later determined to be a bent piece of wire they 
found in the suspect's possession, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said the man was using the wire to move the blinds and afford 
a better view of the apartment's female occupant. Officers also noted that 
several small holes had been punched in the screen. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; COURT DATE FOR MAN CITED IN FIRE MOVED

<P>
 The arraignment for a Camarillo man accused of accidentally starting a fire in 
Los Padres National Forest last month was continued Thursday in a Santa Maria 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing at which Richard Hanger, a U.S. history and government teacher at 
Thousand Oaks High School, is expected to enter his plea of innocence or guilt 
was postponed to Sept. 16, a county clerk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanger was cited for allegedly starting a fire that burned 3,500 acres in 
Santa Barbara County and cost more than $720,000 to extinguish. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanger called the Santa Barbara County Fire Department fearing that he was 
responsible for the blaze after seeing television reports. He had been in the 
forest hunting rabbits with a friend and lit a cigarette to create smoke to 
deter bugs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanger said the cigarette caused a small fire of about one square foot, which 
he and his companion stomped out, smothered in dirt and flooded with five 
gallons of water. 
</P>
<P>
 But fire officials said it may have reignited due to high temperatures and 
light winds in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanger could be billed for the cost of extinguishing the fire, a several-day 
effort that took 600 firefighters, assisted by six air tankers and several 
helicopters. JOANNA M. MILLER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; WORLD WAR II PLANES TO BE DISPLAYED 
</P>

<P>
 More than two dozen fully restored World War II aircraft will be on display 
over the Labor Day weekend when the Southern California Wing of the Confederate 
Air Force holds an open house at Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The display will feature a variety of aircraft used during the war, including 
C-46 transport planes, Bearcat fighters and a Mitchell bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be a series of flying demonstrations Saturday, Sunday and 
Monday, with weather dictating the times and schedules, Confederate Air Force 
Col. Pat Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll show you what the cockpit looks like and you can see the way the troops 
were carried and where the wounded were cared for," Brown said. "We have 
several aircraft that will be set up with ladders across the wings, so people 
can go across and see what it looks like from the wings." 
</P>
<P>
 Music from the 1940s will be played to help set the mood, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The open house, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily, is free to the public and there 
is no charge for parking. It is situated at the Camarillo Airport just off the 
Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 A barbecue dinner is scheduled for Saturday after the open house. For $15, the 
public is invited to dine with the pilots and ask questions about the vintage 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Confederate Air Force is a national organization of aircraft enthusiasts 
dedicated to the preservation of historic planes used for combat between 1939 
and 1945. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; GENERAL SERVICES DIRECTOR QUITS POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The director of Simi Valley's General Services Department has left his post, 
city officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 John R. McMillan is "leaving the city to pursue other professional 
opportunities," according to a statement released by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell said that McMillan, whose last day on the 
job was Thursday, was not leaving the city to take a job somewhere else. Sedell 
declined to comment further.  
</P>
<P>
 McMillan could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 McMillan, 53, worked as director of the General Services Department for a year 
and a half for an annual salary of $97,000. During that time, he acted as Simi 
Valley's top fiscal officer and helped update the city's computer system.  
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to Simi Valley, McMillan was a government consultant and spent 
16 years working for the city of Ventura as a personnel officer, director of 
management services and finally deputy city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Lin Koester has hired a former Simi Valley employee, Donald 
Penman, to act as interim director while he looks for McMillan's permanent 
replacement.  
</P>
<P>
 Penman, 43, worked for Simi Valley as a deputy city manager in charge of 
economic development from 1975 to 1982 before leaving to become city manager of 
San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he became city manager of Baldwin Park. He worked there until 
January, when the City Council eliminated the city manager job. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton said he looked forward to working with Penman. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be able to get somebody who has that kind of experience to come and run 
your shop for a while is a great thing," Stratton said. "It's an opportunity we 
couldn't pass up." SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; FAIR TO FEATURE SHOWS, ARTWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Visual and performing artists from around the world will be featured this 
weekend during the first Westlake Village Fine Arts Faire. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day event will be held outdoors at the Hyatt Westlake Plaza on 
Westlake Boulevard from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., with musical performances continuing 
Saturday from 8 p.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair will be one of seven art festivals throughout Southern California 
aimed at advancing the visual and performing arts, event organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We serve certain areas and locations that seem to be receptive to fine, 
original art," said Dennis Dolan, president of Spectacular Moments, the 
nonprofit organization organizing the art show. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar events are held each year in Carlsbad and Newport Beach, Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend display will include paintings, sculptures, photography, 
glassware, pottery and other crafts. Musical groups from South America, China, 
Mexico, England and the Caribbean will perform, along with a Los Angeles-based 
chamber orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Players and Grupo Folclorico Mixteca will provide theatrical 
entertainment and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday and Sunday, arts and crafts selections will be given away in 
silent drawings, and visitors are encouraged to cast ballots for their favorite 
artists as part of an art competition. An awards ceremony will take place at 5 
p.m. Sunday. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; STOCK CARS TO RACE FOR A GOOD CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three times, Thousand Oaks stock car driver Lee Ladd pushed his car to the 
limit in an annual race for a Westlake Village charity, and three times, he 
crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bad breaks of the past are not enough to keep Ladd away. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, he and 18 other drivers will again circle the track at Saugus 
Speedway, driving not for the checkered flag but for the United Cerebral Palsy 
Homes in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "This race is a lot of fun and it's for a great cause," Ladd said. "I'm going 
back in there at full speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Ladd, along with fellow members of the four Rotary Clubs in the Conejo Valley, 
first organized the "Night at the Races" at Saugus Speedway in the Santa 
Clarita Valley three years ago when he learned that the United Cerebral Palsy 
Homes were in need of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first race, the event has raised more than $40,000 for the homes, 
and Ladd hopes to add $10,000 more this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The race's sponsor, United Cerebral Palsy Support Group, operates two homes on 
Westlake Boulevard and has more than 50 paid staff members and volunteers 
devoted to the care of 15 men and women with cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's race will raise money for a new covered patio at one of the homes. 
It also will be a chance for residents to get out and enjoy the thrills at the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go every year," said Donald Geagan, a 31-year-old Moorpark College student 
who lives at one of the houses. "It's noisy, but it's a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, in addition to watching the race, those who attend will meet many 
of the drivers, who will head into the stands to talk to fans and collect 
additional donations for the homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The race will be held at 7 p.m. Saturday. Tickets cost $10 and all proceeds go 
to the United Cerebral Palsy Homes. For tickets or more information, call Ladd 
at 373-1910, Ext. 222. MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; TACO BELL, PIZZA HUT COMING TO COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two fast-food traditions are making their way to Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 Food service officials at the community college have signed contracts to 
operate small Pizza Hut and Taco Bell franchises inside the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sort of following the models of other colleges and universities," said 
Bud Bailey, food services supervisor at Moorpark College. "The four-year 
schools have been doing it for some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey said a survey conducted last May indicated that Moorpark College 
students and employees would patronize fast-food outlets such as Taco Bell and 
Pizza Hut. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement calls for Moorpark College to keep 90% of the receipts and 
forward the remainder to the two corporations, which in exchange will provide 
sales guidance, training and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 The cafeteria grossed almost $400,000 in revenue last year, Bailey said. But 
Taco Bell and Pizza Hut officials told him to expect an increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The residual effect (Taco Bell) claims is 15% additional business for the 
cafeteria as a whole," Bailey said. "They project a 15% increase just because 
it's there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey expects to hire three additional students for part-time work as a 
result of the fast-food kiosks, which are scheduled to open before the end of 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no ordering at either of the outlets, Bailey said. Customers 
will be able to select tacos, burritos and pizzas from a countertop and pay for 
their food within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's designed to be a grab-and-go arrangement," Bailey said. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: STUDENTS GO BY THE BOOK IN SAFETY PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under a backdrop of children drawing on coloring books filled with safety 
messages, school and law enforcement officials announced a new program Thursday 
that seeks to help keep youngsters safe at school. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Way-sponsored effort, called Play it Safe, provides thousands of 
the books to Ventura County's school-age children, and educators and public 
safety authorities hope they will teach children to watch out for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than simply a picture in a coloring book, each drawing is a springboard 
that can lead parents and children into a discussion," Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury said at announcement ceremonies at the Ventura County Government 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury was joined by a host of school superintendents and United Way 
organizers in announcing the Play it Safe campaign, which began by distributing 
more than 50,000 of the coloring books to area students. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Junette, a former aerospace industry manager who founded Play it Safe 
International in 1974, told the administrators that giving children an 
opportunity to draw pictures of safety lessons helps reinforce the message. 
</P>
<P>
 Junette said the group, which is spending $9,000 in United Way funds to pay 
for the books, began when a group of parents formed to make schools a safer 
environment for children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 19,922 coloring books when we started," he said. "Today we have more 
than 26.5 million in 61 countries." 
</P>
<P>
 United Way spokesman David Menchaca said the effort would branch out to older 
children later this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking to develop into the upper-grade levels by bringing law 
enforcement agencies to the school districts to discuss safety," Menchaca said. 
"We want to bring in those people that have been involved in gangs and violence 
and troubles with the law to discuss a better way of life for youth." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen-year-old Jim Murdoch, a student at Cabrillo Middle School in Ventura, 
said trouble on campus can happen at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can get pretty violent if you say anything," he said. "They take it real 
personally. This program will help, but I'm not sure about the coloring books."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: YOUTHS RECOGNIZED FOR SUMMER WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 280 Ventura County youths were praised in a ceremony Thursday at 
Ventura City Hall for their summer work in several organizations across the 
county.  
</P>
<P>
 The youths, ages 14 to 21, were employed through the Summer Youth Employment 
and Training Program in jobs ranging from assisting librarians to cleaning 
trails in Upper Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 After being presented with certificates for their work during a nearly 
45-minute ceremony, the young workers, their parents and supervisors enjoyed 
the sounds of Hawaiian music played by a local band and savored Hawaiian food, 
including a roasted pig. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be recognized for the work we did during the summer," said 
Robert Delado, 17, who worked as a clerk at Moorpark City Hall. "I learned a 
lot about government and I hope to do something similar next summer." 
</P>
<P>
 The federally funded program that started June 27 offered summer jobs to young 
people in the cities of Moorpark, Ojai, Saticoy and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Today is the final day of work under the program, which placed youths in such 
professional environments as city governments, the Boys & Girls Club and 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them to experience life outside schools and learn about the 
workplace," said Loretta Myers, manager for the program. "It's a great 
opportunity for kids who otherwise would not have a job for the summer."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ACCORD URGED ON AMBULANCE PACT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Paramedics and emergency medical technicians for Pruner Ambulance are prepared 
to walk off the job if negotiations for a new contract are not completed soon, 
a union official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Rupert, the national representative for the International Assn. of EMTs 
and Paramedics, said negotiators have met nearly half a dozen times over the 
past three months without reaching an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The approximately 80 workers want higher salaries, better benefits and more 
relaxed disciplinary procedures, he said. He declined to elaborate on any 
disciplinary action he felt was too harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time the union has tried to negotiate a contract for the 
Pruner medical workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are first on-scene," Rupert said. "They are an extension of an 
emergency hospital. They're the lifesavers. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time they get to the hospital, they are susceptible to catching AIDS 
or hepatitis, they can be shot at, beat up. And these guys make less than the 
guys who pick up your trash." 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert said a four-year veteran Pruner paramedic in his union makes $7 an 
hour. "If you look at the prices you get charged being hauled in an ambulance, 
that's pretty sad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Murphy, president of the ambulance company that serves most of Ventura 
County, said he was not prepared to discuss negotiations publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very early into this negotiation process," he said. "We had a mutual 
agreement to negotiate privately, and we intend to abide by that agreement. We 
are actively negotiating in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pruner firm was sold earlier this year to CareLine Inc., a publicly held 
ambulance provider that has negotiated several deals with the IAEP over the 
years, Rupert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert said his members could stage informational pickets, work slowdowns or 
an outright strike in coming months if a pay increase is not agreed upon. JEFF

A RECORD THAT NO ONE WANTED TO SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's more proof that the Northridge earthquake has set a staggering new 
standard of destruction. According to Bernard Kulik, associate administrator 
for disaster assistance for the Small Business Administration, the number of 
SBA loan applications issued by and returned to the agency since the main 
temblor now surpasses the total recorded after the following major disasters: 
</P>
<P>
 Hurricane Hugo in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the Carolinas in 1989; 
the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989; the Los Angeles riots in 1992; Hurricane 
Andrew in Florida and Louisiana in 1992; Typhoon Omar in Guam in 1992; 
Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii in 1992, and 1993's great Midwest floods, which 
covered parts of nine states. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the worst 12 months ever recorded in terms of the number and amount 
of SBA disaster loans were logged last fiscal year, with 55,000 loans amounting 
to $1.6 billion. Already this year the Northridge quake has amounted to 110,000 
loans and $3.55 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus when the number of people who have registered for Northridge disaster 
assistance (600,000 and counting) begins to rival the population of the 
nation's 19th-largest city (Washington), you can begin to see how thousands of 
people might fall through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, an SBA survey conducted last month found that 17% had not turned in 
loan applications for at least one of the following reasons: because they did 
not know that the SBA would loan money to cover insurance deductibles, because 
they did not know that the filing deadlines have been repeatedly extended or 
because they assumed that they would not qualify for a loan. Given the 313,000 
SBA loan applications outstanding, about 53,000 people might qualify for help 
and don't know it.  
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is that the scam artists, hoping to take advantage of 
confusion and dismay and make easy money, are out in droves to prey upon the 
unsuspecting. One example involved a KTLA-TV cameraman who allowed an 
unlicensed contractor to work on his home, which he had vacated. The phony 
contractor moved his family into the house, and eviction procedures took nearly 
seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and state and local 
officials are working on separate letters to quake victims in Los Angeles, 
Ventura and Orange counties who have received SBA loan applications and have 
not yet turned them in. These may help those who deserve aid but are unaware 
that it is still available. The Los Angeles letter will notify recipients of 
local aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The sooner those letters are sent out, the better. And officials of the 
Contractors State License Board are taking part in sweeps through quake-damaged 
neighborhoods in search of unlicensed contractors. The sweeps are an excellent 
idea that may curtail "aftershocks" of fraud, shoddy work and additional 
misery.

IDEOLOGICAL CRACKUP ON THE ROAD TO CAIRO?; VATICAN AND ALLIES TAKE AIM AT U.N. 
POPULATION CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Controversy marks the International Conference on Population and Development 
even before it convenes in Cairo next Monday to develop global strategies to 
stabilize population growth. The Vatican, offended by proposed programs for 
contraceptives and abortion on the conference agenda, is waging a campaign 
against those population-control measures. In the process it has found some 
Islamic allies. Crusading against promiscuity and birth control, the Vatican 
has complained that Vice President Al Gore, who will head the U.S. delegation 
in Cairo, is misrepresenting the conference's intentions on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican, its Islamic allies, liberal Catholics, moderate Muslims, the 
Clinton Administration and the organizers of the U.N. conference appear to be 
headed for a collision on the road to Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 That is unfortunate, because a diplomatic confrontation could deter the 
conference from its goal of formulating a 20-year program to stabilize world 
population at 7.27 billion by the year 2050. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Catholic and Muslim objections are no doubt sincere, it is obvious 
to any reasonable person that something must be done or population growth will 
exceed the capacity of the world to feed, clothe and house its people -- who 
will number 11.5 billion by 2150 if present trends continue. 
</P>
<P>
 THE BIG PICTURE: The population conference is not about denigrating family, 
church or religion. It is not about coercive programs or abortions. The 
conference's draft plan focuses in large part on improving the economic and 
social status of women. 
</P>
<P>
 This is to be achieved by increasing literacy and improving health care for 
children and by expanding access to birth control and family planning for those 
who want it. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also explicitly advocates the right of women to "safe, effective, 
affordable and acceptable methods of fertility regulation of their choice," 
including "pregnancy termination" as part of women's reproductive health 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican's criticism of the draft plan stems from legitimate and deeply 
held views on abortion shared by many, but not all, Roman Catholics. 
Ironically, one of the strongest recent statements calling for a worldwide 
program to curb population growth came from the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. 
This group of academics appointed by the Pope warned of "unresolvable problems" 
for future generations and recommended a worldwide average of two children per 
couple, compared to the current overall rate of 3.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Vatican's critics is the U.S.-based Catholics for a Free Choice. 
More than 3,200 U.S. Catholics and 55 organizations have signed a full-page 
newspaper advertisement challenging the Vatican stance against contraception. 
</P>
<P>
 MUSLIM PERSPECTIVE: Similarly, while the Vatican's Islamic allies -- including 
the Muslim World League, the Organization of Islamic Conference and the Muslim 
World Congress -- also object to the draft plan, they differ somewhat on the 
points of contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Muslims also oppose abortion on moral grounds. Unlike the Catholic 
Church, however, Islam has a tolerance for birth control, although permanent 
sterilization is forbidden except to protect the mother's health. Thus 
countries such as Egypt and Iran, which forbid abortions, have been among the 
forerunners in curbing population growth through family planning programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cairo, the proposed global action plan will be subject to change, and that 
is to be expected. What is expected to also emerge from the conference are 
substantive voluntary strategies that nations can adapt to their own religious 
and cultural norms. Given the severe problems unrestrained population growth 
could pose for the world, it seems unwise to preclude discussion of any 
reasonable strategy.

ROOTING OUT ANOTHER NATIONAL SHAME; BLACK-ON-BLACK CRIME CRISIS IS POINTED UP 
BY THE ASSAULT ON CIVIL RIGHTS FIGURE ROSA PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The criminal attack on Rosa Parks, the 81-year-old widow who is considered the 
mother of the modern civil rights movement, calls attention to the epidemic of 
black-on-black crime. The rising tide of violence must be addressed not just by 
police but by responsible African Americans fighting crime as courageously as 
Parks fought legal segregation.  
</P>
<P>
 "Many gains have been made, but as you can see at this time, we still have a 
long way to go," Parks said after she was beaten and robbed in the bedroom of 
her Detroit home. "So many of our young people are going astray." The crime 
statistics prove her point. Black Americans are much more likely to become 
victims of violent crime than other Americans. In most cases, their attackers 
are also black. That appears to be the case in the Parks assault. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Rev. Jesse Jackson points out, Parks was not assaulted by the Ku Klux 
Klan or racist skinheads. She says she was struck by a young black man. Thus 
the attacker would be one of those for whom civil rights protesters sacrificed 
so much. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks' courage in 1955 in refusing to obey an order to move to the back of a 
bus so a white man could have her seat prompted the famous Montgomery, Ala., 
bus boycott. The protest was led by a young minister who renounced violence, 
Martin Luther King Jr. The protesters prevailed, but not without great personal 
cost. Parks could no longer find work in Alabama and moved to Detroit, then 
considered part of the job-rich Northern "Promised Land." No one foresaw that 
Detroit, like other major cities, would lose much of that promise. 
</P>
<P>
 After Parks was attacked this week, police circulated a composite drawing of 
the assailant. Armed with that sketch, her neighbors captured a suspect and 
held him for police. These people refused to be intimidated. Such a sense of 
neighborly help must become contagious. Police need help from people who are 
willing to come forward and work hard to make the streets safe again. In 1955, 
Rosa Parks challenged America to fight discrimination. In 1994, Rosa Parks 
challenges America to fight another national shame -- rampant crime.

DOLE THWARTING CLINTON PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Ed Gamble's cartoon portraying Sen. Bob Dole as a self-serving naysayer to 
all Clinton-proposed legislation (Drawingboard, Aug. 16) capsulized the 
hypocrisy of the Senate minority leader and his cohorts. What concerns me is 
that Dole and his kind -- those who are blocking the President's agenda 
regardless of its merit and who are stoking the fires of scandal at every 
opportunity -- are doing more harm to the office of the presidency than 
anything Bill Clinton may or may not have done 10 years ago in Arkansas. And 
they are at least as immoral as Clinton -- if he is guilty -- because they are 
harming the entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's determination to demean the President and destroy his credibility is 
obviously part of a concerted effort to destroy the man he wants to run against 
in 1996. What Sen. Dole may learn, should he become the next President, is that 
he may well have paved the road to his own destruction by teaching his 
opponents how to bring down a President. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not an apologist for Bill Clinton. I certainly don't always agree with 
him. But I am appalled when politicians are willing to sacrifice our national 
interests to personal ambition.  
</P>

 * At last count, President Clinton "owned" the Senate and the House. Clinton's 
Democratic majority in both houses should allow him to get any bill through 
Congress that he wants without any Republican votes! Gamble's depiction of Dole 
as an obstructionist is misleading. Dole, other Republicans and obviously some 
Democratic lawmakers are exercising the democratic process to express their own 
and their constituency's objections to the Clinton socialistic steamroller. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, I hope that Dole or any other presidential candidate will be able to 
say, in 1996, that Clinton has not done anything.

<P>
 * In Susan Estrich's biased column regarding "change" (Opinion, Aug. 28) she 
condemns Republicans for opposing certain aspects of the crime bill. It is 
their job to seek to formulate a better bill. And, Ms. Estrich, the Republicans 
have no need to try to embarrass the President. He does an excellent job of 
embarrassing himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive Clinton health reform plan is bad legislation. If you had read 
recent poll results, you would know it is not supported by a majority of 
Americans. It is a labyrinth of edicts conjured up by Hillary Clinton, Ira 
Magaziner and 500-plus people. No one understands its complex terms or how it 
will be paid for. It is supreme arrogance to anticipate forcing this monster on 
260 million people in one giant swoop. 
</P>
<P>
 Change merely for the sake of change is dismal policy and without merit. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * Estrich is right on the money! Her article nails the pols, particularly the 
Dole-led Republican "win at all costs" partisans on their policy of 
embarrassing the President. 
</P>
<P>
 I would suggest that we keep records of our elected representatives who vote 
on principle and what is best for our united nation and give them the high 
marks and reelection they deserve. Those who bow to the pressure of the party 
thugs, PACs and the single-issue ideologues need to join the ranks of the 
unemployed in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 In my "real world," politics is the art of the possible. It is not necessary 
to win at all costs or even to totally win every battle. What is important is 
that I, as representative of the electorate, be heard, that all of us be 
accorded respect for our opinions and that what is in the interest of the 
common good be the stuff of which legislation is constructed.

<P>
 * "GOP Election Agenda Rests on Risky Tactics" (Aug. 28) cites Democratic 
complaints that "the Republicans believe that if Clinton proposals fail, they 
won't get blamed and, if he wins, he won't get credit." Perhaps this belief 
stems in part from the following. 
</P>
<P>
 When a procedural vote initially blocked the crime bill in the House on Aug. 
11, The Times' Aug. 12 headline declared it a "Major Setback for Clinton." An 
accompanying news analysis stated "when the history books are written, Thursday 
may just be recalled as the day President Clinton's luck -- and with it his 
effectiveness -- finally ran out." Ten days later when the House reversed 
itself and passed the crime bill, The Times (Aug. 22) suggested it was really a 
"Pyrrhic" victory for Clinton "doing little to erase the impression after days 
of apocalyptic press coverage, that he is a weak President." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after three days of fierce, do-or-die Republican opposition, the 
Senate upheld the House's decision and The Times (Aug. 26) then stated, "The 
effort required to pass the bill marked something of a setback for the White 
House and the Senate's Democratic leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 I leave it to your readers to make their own news analysis of this.

 * Dole now comes through as a man who has suddenly realized that he is 71 and 
must make a desperate run at the presidency or lose the chance. He appears now 
an ugly personality. So, the needs of the people can wait while he does what 
needs to be done to buy up a support base. He once seemed a reasonable person 
who could be President.

 I was very disappointed to learn that the major reason the MTA is 
discontinuing its monthly bus passes is due to the number of counterfeit ones 
that have been circulating. 
</P>
<P>
 Woe to the society that succumbs to its small criminal element over the vast 
majority of hard-working people who rely on public transportation to get them 
to their jobs! Rather than making public transportation easier and more 
accessible to the people in this age of traffic and air pollution, we are 
taking a giant step backward as we let the lawbreakers have the last word. 
</P>
<P>
 How about having more police investigating counterfeit activity and 
incorporating stiffer sentences for those convicted?

'HEALTH CZAR' POWERS UNDER 186 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Open your election umbrellas! If the Aug. 26 commentary on Prop. 186 about a 
supposed "health czar" is any indication, a deluge of lies will be poured onto 
us by an anti-186 campaign that will spend any amount of your insurance 
premiums to defeat health reform.  
</P>
<P>
 I know a little bit about the section of the initiative dealing with the 
commissioner's powers that was attacked by Sally Pipes' column -- I helped 
write it. * Pipes' article says that the commissioner is empowered to "tell 
doctors what procedures they can perform." It is utterly false. The act states 
that all Californians have a right to "medically appropriate" care. If your 
doctor says it is needed, it will be paid for, with no insurance company 
bureaucrat with an eye to profits second-guessing your doctor's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The only limit upon the care paid for is in section 24045. If there is no 
"medical indication," then it isn't covered.  
</P>
<P>
 * The health commissioner is subject to more checks and balances than the CEO 
of any insurer. By statute, the commissioner must consult with a board of 
medical experts on any decision that has to do with care. Pipes left out the 
references to the advisory board in her quotes from 186. Pipes also "forgot" to 
mention the fully independent Health Care Consumer Council established by 186. 
She also "forgot" about the regional advocate, whose sole job is to report to 
the consumers in each community about how the system is working for them.  
</P>
<P>
 * Section 2500(d) of Prop. 186 states: "Californians should be guaranteed the 
freedom to choose their own doctor or health care provider." Pipes baldly says 
that " 'the patient's provider of choice' will probably be a . . . primary care 
provider." Where does the act say that? Nowhere.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, missing from Pipes' article is why 186 grants power to the 
commissioner. The drafters didn't want the commissioner to be able to blame 
anyone else if things weren't working as well as they should. ED HOWARD 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Aug. 24 article, "Getting a Jump on Health Care," there were numerous 
misleading statements. : 
</P>
<P>
 False statement: "In any case, Prop. 186 sets an absolute maximum of 4% on 
administrative costs." Fact: A 4% administrative overhead is fantasy. The 
Department of Education has a 15% overhead and the California Lottery has a 
16.6% overhead. Does anyone truly believe that state-run health care will only 
be 4%? 
</P>
<P>
 False statement: "All premiums, all deductibles, all caps on expenditures and 
most co-payments and out-of-pocket expenses would disappear." Fact: The 
initiative allows the health commissioner to add additional co-payments or 
require full payment for some services if the system lacks funds. 
</P>
<P>
 False statement: "Businesses would benefit because the new payroll tax would 
be less than their current health-insurance costs." Fact: Currently 20% of the 
state's businesses do not provide health coverage. For these businesses the 
additional taxes will be harmful. Many businesses will be forced to cut 
employee wages, fire employees or raise the prices of goods and services.

 * I applaud Mayor Richard Riordan's decision to get involved with the AQMD 
smog plan (Aug. 10). Next he should lobby the federal government to allocate a 
substantial commitment of land and water conservation funds for the L.A. 
region.These are moneys paid to the federal government by the oil companies to 
mitigate pollution caused by oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 It is scandalous that the federal government is hoarding funds ($800 million 
per year) created to mitigate pollution caused by oil drilling, while at the 
same time threatening us with sanctions for not meeting federal air quality 
standards.  
</P>
<P>
 Please join us in our efforts to loosen land and water conservation funds to 
preserve critical airshed, such as the 5,400-acre Ahmanson Ranch, located next

RETURN TO SCHOOL IS A RITE OF RENEWAL; LABOR DAY: IT'S A TIME TO LOOK FORWARD 
-- WHETHER TO FRESHLY SHARPENED PENCILS OR OLD FRIENDS IN A NEW ROOM.

 I have always thought of Labor Day as the true beginning of the new year. It's 
a much better holiday than the one we celebrate by lobotomizing ourselves with 
bad champagne, feigned fun and football. On Labor Day there are no dopey hats, 
no French kisses from strangers, no babies dropping into the world without 
blood or pain wearing Miss America banners. No one mopes about auld 
acquaintances or makes resolutions that are really just old regrets. On Labor 
Day everybody looks forward. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose there was a time when the end of summer meant nothing to me, during 
that nanosecond when I wasn't going back to school or watching my husband go 
back (and back) to school. But soon I had babies and it seemed that I thought 
of nothing but school. Or rather, I worried: Should I send my daughter to 
school A, where she would master phonics by age 3 but might be emotionally 
crippled, or to school B, where she would make her own writing implements, eat 
sprouted-wheat snacks and learn to read five minutes before taking the PSATs? 
Even last August, when my fondest wish came true -- Charlotte got off the 
waiting list and into the school everyone wanted -- I still worried. I probably 
was facing two years of social intercourse with 30 thin-lipped Lexus owners who 
would all wear makeup with Madras shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometime around Labor Day, Charlotte's excitement penetrated my fog of 
anxiety. "At my new school there's a fireman's pole and I think I'll be a 
little scared to go down it, but my teacher's going to help me," she announced 
after Mrs. Huber's home visit, just the way an adult might say, "I don't speak 
a word of French, but I just got offered a free penthouse overlooking the Seine 
and I'll be moving next week." 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't remember whether I had felt that way before my first day of 
preschool (well, we didn't even have preschool, it was nursery school then). 
But I did remember other things about school: the clean, smooth feel of 
brand-new loose-leaf binder paper, the smell of freshly sharpened pencils and 
perfectly rhomboid Pink Pearl erasers. To think of those things still gives me 
a small thrill of hope, still stirs in me some unaccountable conviction that 
this year will be the best of all. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte is already savoring that delicious combination of knowing the ropes 
and starting anew that comes with the beginning of every school year. "I'm 
going to the same school with the same kids," she tells strangers at Safeway. 
"But this time I'll be in the blue class instead of the red, and it will be 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 Ring in the new.

PINCHED BY THE PRIVATIONS OF FREEDOM; POLAND: THE DIFFICULT FREE-MARKET 
TRANSFORMATION HAS MANY YEARNING FOR THE BAD OLD DAYS OF COMMUNISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK F. BRZEZINSKI, Mark F. Brzezinski was a Fulbright Scholar in Warsaw. 
The son of Carter administration national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, 
he is writing a book on Polish political and constitutional reform. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years ago in Poland, a Solidarity-led parliamentary coalition defied the 
communist regime and formed a government around Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a 
Solidarity leader and long-time adviser to Lech Walesa. That act signaled the 
end of the totalitarian phase of Polish political life and the beginning of a 
historic era of political and economic transition, an era known as 
"post-communism." 
</P>
<P>
 While at first Polish political elites and Western analysts thought that a 
sustainable political democracy and market economy could be built in five to 10 
years, the complexity of the systemic changes required is now better 
understood, and it is likely that Poland's post-communist era will last almost 
as long as its communist period. Moreover, five years into the transformation, 
Polish post-communism has manifested several characteristic features that were 
not anticipated: 
</P>
<P>
 * The return of old elites. One of the least expected recent developments is 
the re-emergence of the old power elite as the new power elite. It was the 
communist nomenklatura, not the working-class members of Solidarity, who were 
best positioned in 1989 to exploit the chaotic atmosphere of political and 
economic transformation. People like Jerzy Urban, the former spokesman for the 
regime and now one of Poland's most successful businessmen, were able to peddle 
influence in the unregulated financial environment and to exploit their 
connections with the mid-level bureaucracy. In the suburbs of Warsaw, villas 
are being built to complement the luxurious lifestyles of these former 
apparatchiks, frustrating the average citizen who has neither the capital nor 
the contacts with which to exploit the fruits of the people's long fight.This 
new/old social elite has significant linkages with fellow travelers in the 
current post-communist government who, if history is any indicator, will not be 
immune to self-interest and corruption in Poland's uncontrolled political 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lessening of the free market's legitimacy. While Poland is considered by the 
West to be an economic success story, Polish society has paid a heavy price for 
macroeconomic success through shock therapy, and this has affected the social 
legitimacy of economic reform and of the notion of the free market. Two-thirds 
of Polish society is financially worse off now compared with five years ago. 
Inflation is still high (averaging 40%), unemployment is climbing (topping 15%) 
and prices for household basics such as milk and bread are increasing 50% per 
year. More than half of all Poles have no savings whatsoever, and the homeless 
-- hitherto unseen -- have become a common sight. Paradoxically to most Poles, 
as citizens pay taxes for the first time, social safety nets are being torn 
down, with drastic cuts imposed on spending on health care, education, pensions 
and unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 As the number of victims of economic reform rises, society's commitment to the 
free market, or to "capitalism with a wolf's face" as Citizens' Rights leader 
Tadeusz Zielinski recently put it, is diminishing. According to recent surveys, 
seven in 10 Poles are dissatisfied with the results of economic reform and 39% 
would like the economy to be "closer to a socialist economy." Popular support 
for the economic reform program stands at only 12%, with the majority of Poles 
stating that their country is heading in the "wrong direction." This 
disenchantment with economic reform is reflected in a conversation I listened 
to several weeks ago in Warsaw between two university students. They were 
discussing the difficulties of daily life in modern Poland, and after a long, 
heated discussion one student finally concluded "We voted for democracy and 
what we got was capitalism!" 
</P>
<P>
 * Popular cynicism toward politics. Surprisingly, in the country where the 
broad-based sociopolitical movement Solidarity brought down communism, politics 
today is seen as an inaccessible forum for change. Society feels alienated from 
the public policy-making process, thanks both to the Solidarity-led governments 
of the early 1990s, which were perceived as elitist and insensitive to the 
suffering of society, and to the new post-communist government, which displays 
a tendency toward secrecy reminiscent of the communist era. In a return of the 
old "us versus them" dynamic, the government makes little effort to explain 
even the most basic aspects of the national economic and political program. 
Thus, even important state programs, such as privatization, remain an enigma to 
most Poles. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment of former communists to important state positions only fuels 
this cynicism. According to recent surveys, 41% of Poles feel that the current 
political system is closer to an "undemocratic" system than a democratic one in 
terms of its representation of the needs and aspirations of the people, and 
only 1% are "satisfied" with the way democracy works in Poland. Most Poles 
suspect those in power of enriching themselves at the public's expense, with 
close to 80% stating that political elites use their position to promote their 
private interests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nostalgia for the "old" system. A series of graffiti scrawled on a Warsaw 
building proclaims: "Bring back communism!" "We never had communism!" "Then 
bring back what we had!" The difficulties that encumber Polish society during 
the early phase of the post-communist transformation are fostering a misguided 
nostalgia for a past that is falsely idealized. But to an increasing majority 
of Poles, the basic employment security and the provision of social services 
supposedly enjoyed in the Polish People's Republic overshadow the new reality 
of having a choice among products and not having to stand in line for hours to 
buy them. With more than 75% of Poles finding a summer vacation unaffordable 
this year, appreciation of the freedom to travel diminishes in nostalgia for 
the "good old days" of guaranteed holidays.  
</P>
<P>
 This nostalgia for the past has permeated even younger generations as they 
form their beliefs about what constitutes democracy. Teaching a class at the 
University of Warsaw, I asked my students to define democracy. Expecting a 
discussion on individual liberties and authentically elected institutions, I 
was surprised to hear my students respond that to them, democracy means a 
government obligation to maintain a certain standard of living and to provide 
health care, education and housing for all. In other words, socialism. 
</P>
<P>
 While nostalgia for the past has become a common refrain in Poland, no 
political party has yet openly advocated a return to the past system. The 
anti-Solidarity coalition won because it succeeded in conveying the message 
that it could combine the new freedoms (including many aspects of the free 
market) with the social security of the past. As Polish leaders struggle to 
sustain the country's high growth rate and to continue the process of 
privatization, bringing higher prices and increased unemployment, social 
discontent will increase, memories of the past will become rosier and parties 
that advocate government paternalism will become the dominant political 
preference. That is exactly the danger that the ongoing economic difficulties, 
the popular cynicism and the nostalgia for the past are fostering.

SEASON COULD BE DECLARED OVER IN TWO WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With no negotiating sessions scheduled for the Labor Day weekend, baseball's 
acting commissioner, Bud Selig, said Thursday he will spend the holiday taking 
a closer look at a possible shutdown date for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tragic situation, but sooner or later you reach the point of 
diminishing return," Selig said. "We're not there yet, but it is September on 
my calendar." 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed the owners have tentatively set Sept. 15 as the date by which a 
decision must be made. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with TV advertisers turning away from the uncertainty of the playoffs 
and World Series to put their money elsewhere, the owners no longer have $140 
million in TV revenue at stake in postseason play. They may not feel compelled 
to wait until mid-month to write off the 1994 season and formulate plans to 
unilaterally implement their salary-cap proposal. The season could go down as 
early as Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Selig nor chief negotiator Richard Ravitch would estimate what 
postseason play is now worth in terms of TV revenue, but the 21-day strike by 
major league players has delivered a significant financial hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were off to a wonderful start, but the advertisers stopped investing in 
early August," Selig said, a reference to the start of the strike Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of potentially $5 million a club in postseason TV revenue compounds a 
significant regular-season setback. During the four-year, $1.06-billion 
contract with CBS, each team received about $14 million a year in national TV 
revenue. In the first half-year of the partnership with ABC and NBC, each club 
has received about $1.5 million, an American League executive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch maintains that the salary-cap proposal addressed the TV falloff among 
other critical revenue issues. It continues to generate unprecedented unanimity 
among the owners despite possible loss of the World Series and pressure from 
some high-revenue clubs favoring compromise and resumption of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven to nine of the big-market clubs, among them the Dodgers, have been 
keeping the phone lines busy, according to sources, but have been unable to 
muster breakthrough support. Twenty-one of the 28 clubs have to approve a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that even some of those high-revenue clubs, as unhappy as they 
are with the prospect of the season going down, are more excited with the 
prospect of winning a negotiation and coming out with a new system," a source 
close to the situation said, alluding to unilateral implementation of the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that winning, considering the union would challenge it through the National 
Labor Relations Board and resume the strike next spring? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're jumping off the bridge hand in hand," a management source said of the 
owners and players.

SOUL OF THE MATTER SHARP IN COMEBACK VICTORY

 Burt Bacharach had not been to a racetrack since the Kentucky Derby. 
Coincidentally, neither had his 3-year-old, Soul Of The Matter.Bacharach was at 
Del Mar Thursday to watch his horse make his comeback run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a 7:30 a.m. flight to Houston tomorrow," Bacharach said. "I hope 
this whole trip is worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter, fifth in the Derby, had been kept in the stable because of 
hoof injuries until blowing away the allowance field in Thursday's eighth race. 
Jockey Kent Desormeaux had him seven lengths behind a pack of five horses 
entering the stretch. When Desormeaux finally found a hole, Soul Of The Matter 
breezed to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had all kinds of excuses to lose," Bacharach said. "He was trapped, 
trapped, trapped. It seemed Kent had nowhere to take him." 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter has four victories in eight starts, finishing out of the 
money only in the Kentucky Derby. Trainer Richard Mandella said he has no 
schedule set for his next start. DAVE DISTEL

MAYBERRY SUSPENDED AFTER HORSE FAILS TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Brian Mayberry was suspended for 30 days Thursday by the California 
Horse Racing Board because of what CHRB stewards at Del Mar identified as a 
positive drug test on a horse he ran at Hollywood Park on July 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling said that Gamblin A.J., trained by Mayberry at the time, was found 
with a foreign substance, promazine sulfoxide, in his urine after the sixth 
race that day.Steward Dave Samuel described promazine sulfoxide as a 
tranquilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Gamblin A.J. reared in the starting gate, losing jockey Martin 
Pedroza, and did not run the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners of all races are tested, along with all claimed horses, the first 
three finishers in stakes races and nine others at random each day. Gamblin 
A.J. was claimed by trainer Mike Mitchell out of that Hollywood Park field, 
prompting the drug test. 
</P>
<P>
 The horse is scheduled to run in Saturday's Del Mar Debutante out of the 
Mitchell barn. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the terms of the suspension, Mayberry loses his license 
privileges and is denied access to all premises within the CHRB's jurisdiction. 
The 30-day period will begin next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting in line with other jurisdictions," said Ingrid Fermin, a 
steward at both Hollywood Park and Del Mar. "In the past, other jurisdictions 
have been more severe than the State of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayberry, 56, was irate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my first offense after a long and pretty good career as a horse 
trainer, and I get a 30-day suspension," he said. "I went in there like a 
wide-eyed innocent, without a lawyer, like I was advised. If I didn't have two 
daughters following in my footsteps, it might make me quit training." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayberry, who called the trainers' responsibility rule archaic as written, 
said he will appeal the suspension.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS DAMPENED BY SELLOFF AS TECH ISSUES LOSE LUSTER 
</P>

 A selloff in technology issues led the stock market lower Thursday, in the 
second consecutive session of decline since a strong run-up to the highest 
level in half a year. A jump in Treasury yields in the morning contributed to 
the decline of stocks, though bonds ended the day virtually unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 By the closing bell, the Dow Jones industrial average had recovered more than 
half what it lost during the day. It ended at 3,901.44, off 11.98 but still 
less than 100 points from its all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Allyn, director of listed equity trading at Jefferies & Co., said prices 
were drifting downward because of diminished participation. "I think it's 
listless trading before the (Labor Day) weekend," Allyn said. Also, August 
unemployment figures were due out today.  
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones more than 3 to 2 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Heavy selling of technology issues pushed broad market indexes 
lower. The NYSE's composite index fell 1.01 to 260.98. The Nasdaq index fell 
6.67 to 758.95. Standard & Poor's 500 slipped 2.32 to 473.17. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technology stocks had big run-ups," said Jonathan Dodd, market analyst at 
Dean Witter. "Some of these have gotten extended, and that's the reason you're 
seeing some of them getting hit so hard."  
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the selling was triggered by the news Wednesday that computer 
maker AST Research Corp. would post a loss for its current quarter and show 
flat revenue. Also, SoundView, an investment firm that specializes in 
technology stocks, downgraded Compaq and Microsoft, just one day after it 
downgraded Texas Instruments and Micron Technology. Arnold Owen, managing 
director of trading at SoundView, said analysts at his firm are concerned that 
a price war and diminishing orders will compress the margins for personal 
computer companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond and dollar markets were quiet and little changed Thursday, as traders 
awaited the August employment report. Bond yields initially rose after the 
release of a National Assn. of Purchasing Management report that indicates a 
slowdown in manufacturing in August and that manufacturers had paid more for 
supplies last month. Both figures raised concerns about inflation.  
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's market highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * AST sank 4 15/16 to 13 1/16. Compaq Computer dropped 2 1/4 to 35 and 
International Business Machines lost 5/8 to 67 7/8. Microsoft was down 2 to 56 
1/8; Apple fell 13/16 to 35 3/8; Dell Computer was down 1 to 31 1/2; Intel 
slipped 1 1/2 to 64 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * CBS jumped 11 1/8 to 332 1/2 on speculation about mergers among some of the 
big media networks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retail issues were mixed following the release of August retail sales 
figures. Gap fell 4 3/4 to 38 1/4; Dayton Hudson lost 3 5/8 to 81 1/8. 
Federated reported a 5.9% rise in sales at stores open at least a year, and its 
shares jumped 1 3/8 to 22 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * In London, the pound advanced in New York to $1.5455 from $1.5345. Jim 
Blackwelder, a vice president at NatWest Financial Markets Group, said the 
pound drew strength from growing speculation that the Bank of England will 
raise interest rates to cool the British economy and from optimism about ending 
civil strife in Northern Ireland. Shares in London ended sharply lower, 
however, as many players were wary after a recent rally. The FTSE-100 index 
fell 34.8 points, or 1.07%. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt share prices finished the day lower after the Bundesbank announced 
it was leaving interest rates unchanged. Other European markets closed lower. 
Tokyo's Nikkei average rose 14.40 points, or 0.07%, to 20,642.93.

BOOK REVIEW / POLITICS; IS THE GREAT WHITE NORTH A THREAT TO THE UNITED 
STATES?; BREAKUP: THE COMING END OF CANADA AND THE STAKES FOR AMERICA BY 
LANSING LAMONT ; NORTON,$25, 256 PAGES 
</P>

 You know Lansing Lamont has his work cut out for him when you realize that the 
key point of this book -- Canada could be a serious threat to the United States 
-- is also the punch line in a comedy now being produced by director Michael 
Moore. In Moore's Dr. Strangelovian film, a saber-rattling President gives a 
Niagara Falls sheriff (played by John Candy) the bright idea of invading Canada 
before it invades us. 
</P>
<P>
 Ha-ha, tee-hee: It's hard to get worked up about this seemingly benign and 
innocuous "Nebraska North," a place whose name, one legend goes, comes from 
Spanish fishermen off Newfoundland who remarked that there was aca nada , 
nothing here. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps our attitude derives from Canada's historical role as a refuge from 
conflict, not a source of it. In 1776, 100,000 British loyalists found shelter 
on the shores of Canada's St. Lawrence River. In the 19th Century, slaves 
headed True North on the Underground Railroad: "Farewell, old master," went one 
hymn, "Don't come after me / I'm on my way to Canada / Where colored men are 
free." And in the 1960s, of course, anti-war protesters found sanctuary in a 
country where even the prime minister, Lester Pearson, had to suffer a dressing 
down by L.B.J. (After Pearson spoke out against the American bombing of North 
Vietnam in 1965, L.B.J. told him: "You pissed on mah rug!") 
</P>
<P>
 Even Canada's West, certainly wilder than our own topographically, was 
socially tame, populated not by robber barons, gunslingers and other 
American-style rogues but by the dutiful employees of the Hudson's Bay Company. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '90s, however, Canadians have more than made up for their arguably 
prosaic past with a kind of political pandemonium that makes Ross Perot's 1992 
"challenge" to our two-party system pale by comparison. In last year's 
elections alone, the nation's long-dominant conservative Tory Party plunged 
from 157 parliamentary seats to two, while the leftist New Democrats retained 
only eight of their 44 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Inciting most of the fervor is the growing desire of many French-speaking 
Quebecois to secede from Canada's 127-year-old confederacy. In the scholarly 
but stylish "Breakup," Lamont captures the depth of that desire by painting the 
scene at a Montreal disco palace Oct. 27, 1992, just after Canadian voters had 
rejected an accord aimed at thwarting secession: 
</P>
<P>
 As a burst of pyrotechnics engulfs the stage in flashing lights, smoke and 
whorls of sparklers, Quebec's pro-secession leader, Jacques Parizeau, strides 
onto the stage. "Pounding steel drums mix with the cheering," Lamont writes, 
"to create a pandemonium of sound atavistic, almost feral, in its intensity." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days from today, a similar burst of secessionist fervor is expected to 
boost Parizeau and his Parti Quebecois into power. If elected, Parizeau has 
promised to hold a referendum on Quebec's secession within a year. While Lamont 
suggests that the Parti will win that referendum (it is only "a matter of 
time," he writes, before Quebec secedes), recent polls show it garnering only 
40% support. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the question remains: Is secession in Quebec's, and Canada's, 
best interests? Lamont's answer is a resounding "no." Strangely, though, his 
most persuasive arguments counsel just the opposite. Lamont points out, for 
example, that the reasons initially motivating Canada's disparate peoples to 
unite -- to ward off annexation by the United States and to affiliate with 
Britain, then the "mightiest empire since Rome"are no longer relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the arguments Lamont musters against secession are generally lame 
(Canada will lose its "enviable tradition of civility") or alarmist (if Quebec 
secedes, he speculates, then who knows, maybe California or Texas will demand 
independence too!). 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the jacket cover blurb helps explain Lamont's fervent opposition 
to "breakup." He is a former vice president and director of Canadian Affairs 
for the Americas Society, a U.S. think tank funded by such corporate interests 
as the Rockefeller Foundation. And no one is edgier about Canada's dissolution 
than American business: Canada, after all, is by far our biggest and stablest 
trading partner, and pro-federalist interests such as the Royal Bank of Canada 
have been warning that Quebec's secession could plunge the country's living 
standard by 16% and send 1.2 million Canadians pouring into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth, of course, is that no one really knows the social or economic costs 
of Quebec's secession. But in a bit of speculative fiction that Lamont uses to 
conclude his book, he sure makes them seem high. Taking us to a futuristic 
hydroelectric plant deep in Quebec's subarctic forest, he follows an "assault 
force" of 300 Cree warriors, enraged by conflicts with the province that have 
been festering since 1990, when Quebec tried to build a golf course on an 
ancient Indian burial ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Descending a canyon-like staircase of huge terraces in the plant's dam, the 
Crees attach hundreds of pounds of plastic explosive to its inner walls. When 
the charges are detonated later that night, the plant's customers in Montreal, 
Quebec City and Boston are plunged into darkness.

 FIRST WORKOUT: The Ducks' first draft pick was finally signed, sealed and 
delivered on Thursday -- for a cool $6.5 million for three seasons. (C1) Paul 
Kariya will step onto The Pond of Anaheim ice for the first time during a free 
public practice Monday. . . . Kariya, 19, will be at one of three two-hour 
sessions with the Ducks from 11 a.m. until 4:45 p.m. He led Canada to the 
silver medal in the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.

 AIRMAN: U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), who favors a 
commercial airport at El Toro, is acknowledging behind-the-scene efforts to 
stop a $700,000 federal planning grant for the Marine base until after a 
countywide vote on the airport in November (B4) . . . Local officials who ended 
up getting the money anyway are miffed. "In Congress there is a certain amount 
of value in being vocal and dramatic," said Kenneth H. Bruner, an aide to Board 
of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley. "Mr. Rohrabacher does that well, but I 
think he is somewhat removed from the workings of local politics."

 BIG NUMBERS: Lifting whatever weights you're comfortable with, how long would 
it take you to lift a million pounds total? Glen Tenove, 39, a mortgage banker 
from Costa Mesa, did it in just under one hour and 39 minutes -- a world record 
(lifting 200 pounds 5,000 times.) "I like endurance challenges," he says. Like: 
doing 10,000 push-ups in seven hours. Tenove will try to break his own 
"million-pound" record in a demonstration at the Raging Waters water park in 
San Dimas on Labor Day.

 VAMPIRE CLIMB: In Style, a new magazine emphasizing who -- and what -- is hot,

demonstrate it too: actress Kristy Swanson of Mission Viejo, star of "Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer."

RULING AGAINST SLEUTH UPHELD IN O.C. CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christopher G. Coulter was collecting evidence for a sexual harassment claim 
against Bank of America when he launched a covert investigation. He hid two 
tiny recorders in his pockets and secretly taped more than 160 private 
conversations with co-workers and supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank employees caught wind of Coulter's taping and filed their own lawsuit, 
accusing the ATM repairman of invading their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County judge awarded the bank and 11 employees $132,000 in damages. 
This week, the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana upheld the judgment, 
ruling that Coulter had gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christopher Coulter was an amateur sleuth," Acting Presiding Justice Edward 
J. Wallin wrote in a ruling made public Thursday. "In this case, his sleuthing 
has cost him $132,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Coulter, who lives in Spring Valley in San Diego County, was working at Bank 
of America branches in Orange, San Diego and Los Angeles counties when he began 
taping in 1989. He contended that a former girlfriend who worked for the bank 
was harassing him and he began taping employees chatting, gossiping and griping 
about work, according to the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversations involved bank vice presidents, field managers and others. 
Topics included Coulter's transfers on the job, his career objectives, 
disciplinary matters and a co-worker's complaint that Coulter was harassing 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Thomas N. Thrasher dismissed Coulter's 
sexual harassment lawsuit but upheld a countersuit filed by 11 unhappy 
co-workers who complained Coulter invaded their privacy without permission.  
</P>
<P>
 Coulter's attorney did not return repeated phone calls Thursday, and Coulter 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Paul W. Cane, one of several lawyers who represented the bank and its 
employees, said the court ruling affirms workplace privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Employees who surreptitiously tape record employees or supervisors face 
substantial risk in doing so," Cane said. "This helps further workplace privacy 
rights because employees now know, just as companies have long known, that this 
kind of surreptitious taping is illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 After filing his lawsuit, Coulter boasted during depositions about secretly 
taping co-workers. But when the admission led defense attorneys to demand the 
tapes under law, Coulter then alleged that the employees were aware the 
conversations were being taped, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 California's Privacy Act prohibits recording communications without the 
consent of all parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Coulter filed his lawsuit in December, 1991, alleging sexual harassment and 
other grievances at work, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 During pretrial meetings, Coulter turned over 16 tapes containing 160 secretly 
recorded conversations. Thrasher later found 44 specific violations of the 
Privacy Act, and awarded $3,000 in damages for each violation. 
</P>
<P>
 In rejecting Coulter's appeal, Wallin pointed out Coulter's contradictory 
statements, noting " . . . Coulter admitted that all of the recordings were 
done without the knowledge or consent of the persons involved. He cannot now 
claim there was a factual issue regarding consent." 
</P>
<P>
 The repairman left Bank of America more than a year ago, Cane said.

 LIFE OF REILLY: The public knows him as the zany comic from "The Match Game" 
and "Hollywood Squares." But Charles Nelson Reilly, who teaches acting in North 
Hollywood, is also an accomplished director. His latest effort, "The Wives," 
written by one of his students, opens Thursday in Studio City. . . . His first 
love, though, was opera, which he's directed across the country. See Valley 
Life! Page 6. 
</P>
<P>
 RUN AND TRANSFER: Pierce quarterback Davis Delmatoff liked his teammates and 
coaches, and had a great season last year. So why did he transfer to Valley 
College? Simple, he prefers the run-and-shoot (C10). . . . That's the system he 
knew in high school. "I just wanted to be back with an offense I was more 
comfortable with," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 FUN COSTS: Nixon lost his office, and Ali regained his championship belt -- 
1974 was quite a year. It was also a time when Valley families could be 
entertained for a modest fee. That day is long gone (Valley Life! Page 10.) . . 
. From swimming at a public pool to amusement at Magic Mountain (above), 
entertainment prices have soared. But consumers have learned how to save. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW SEASON: John Elway, Charles White, Anthony Davis -- this region has served 
as a pretty good breeding ground for college football's top programs. This 
season, which gets fully under way Saturday, should be no different. . . . 
Freshmen expected to make an immediate impact include UCLA's Shaun Williams 
(Crespi), and two Notre Dame players -- John McLaughlin (Hart), and Leon Blunt 
(San Fernando). 
</P>
<P>
 DOVES: Football isn't the only male-bonding activity starting this week. At 
the Antelope Valley Sportsman's Club, hunters arrived as early as 4 a.m. 
Thursday to open dove season. (B1) . . . "It's a prehistoric ritual of guys 
getting together, watching the sunrise and enjoying nature," said club owner 
Dave Whiteside. 
</P>
<P>
 TONIGHT: The Smothers Brothers perform at 7:30 at the Antelope Valley Fair and 
Alfalfa Festival, 155 E. Ave. I, Lancaster. Tickets are $12 to $20.

 BURGLAR ALARM: Seventeen burglaries have taken place at Ventura County fire 
stations while firefighters were away, in some cases, on false alarms (B1) . . 
. Stations in Simi Valley and Newbury Park were the latest to be hit . . . 
Worse yet, investigators suspect that the culprit may work for the Fire 
Department. Said Sgt. Harold Humphries of the Sheriff's Department: "We believe 
that it's either an ex- or a current employee." 
</P>
<P>
 ALL ABOARD?: With attendance at the Ventura County Fair down 10% this year, 
it's no surprise that ridership on Metrolink commuter trains to the fair also 
took a dive . . . Ridership dropped from 30,000 last year to about 21,000. 
Ticket sales will pay for most of the operating costs (B1) . . . the remaining 
$5,000 will be picked up by fair operators. Said one county transportation 
official: "The agreement is that we give our time, energy and support and the 
Fair Board pays the extra costs." 
</P>
<P>
 FAMOUS HILLBILLY: Let me tell you a story 'bout a man named Jed . . . Better 
yet, you can meet the man himself . . . Buddy Ebsen, who starred as Jed 
Clampett in the old television series "The Beverly Hillbillies," will be at 
Phantom Books in Ventura from 1 to 3 p.m. Sunday signing copies of his new 
autobiography, "The Other Side of Oz." . . . In his book, Ebsen recounts how he 
lost the role of the Tin Man in "The Wizard of Oz." Turns out, he nearly died 
after inhaling the aluminum dust in his makeup.

 BEACH WALK: A group of hikers hoping to establish a California coastal trail 
will end their five-day promotional trek along Ventura County's 35-mile-long 
coastline about noon today . . . Meanwhile, the Sierra Club Singles of Ventura 
County are planning their own beach walk this Sunday from Rincon State Park to 
Carpinteria . . . Tender feet need not be discouraged. This walk is a little 
shorter -- seven miles round-trip. Said club official Carol Marsh: "This is 
more suitable for people who want an easy excursion on the weekend."

DISNEY SAYS NEW ROADS WON'T DELAY THEME PARK IN VIRGINIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co. said it will open its theme park in Virginia on schedule 
even if extra freeway lanes and a new interchange needed to serve it are years 
from completion, although government officials warned that could lead to 
gridlock for thousands of drivers.  
</P>
<P>
 Putting 5 million to 6 million annual park guests on western Prince William 
County's existing narrow roads and four-lane I-66 would create "an enormous 
problem," said Kathleen K. Seefeldt, chairman of the Board of County 
Supervisors and one of the project's biggest supporters. But Seefeldt said she 
was sure the roads would be built in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's declaration comes at a strategic time in negotiations between the 
company and county officials, who will decide in the next two months whether to 
approve zoning changes that Disney needs for its park, scheduled to open in 
1998 near Haymarket. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lewis, a senior vice president for Disney Development Co., said the 
company has no desire to open the park if road improvements are not finished. 
But, he said, if park opponents manage to delay the roads by filing lawsuits 
and demanding environmental studies, the company would have no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's obvious that the only thing that's going to keep these 
long-needed, long-planned and funded road improvements from happening . . . are 
. . . these various groups who don't really care about traffic," Lewis said. 
One hurdle that could hold up widening I-66 and adding a new interchange is a 
federal environmental review, which is just beginning and expected to take 
about 18 months. The study could conclude that the park would create more air 
pollution, add to traffic congestion, damage historic sites or destroy 
wetlands, requiring further review. Opponents also have threatened to challenge 
the study with lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Miller, spokesman for the Piedmont Environmental Council, a 
leading opponent of the park, accused Disney of attempting to hold local 
drivers hostage to force approval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're willing to force the citizens to sit in traffic for years to protect 
their own interest," Miller said. "Disney is unwilling to allow the process to 
work itself out to benefit the public . . . and they are willing to put 
pressure on public officials."

TIRE DEALER: DON'T TREAD ON ME; ORDINANCE: TWO BUSINESS OWNERS WHO WANT TO FLY 
18 FLAGS SAY THEY WILL IGNORE CITY LIMIT OF THREE OLD GLORIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oh, say, can you see, four American flags waving on a single property here? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not. It's against the municipal code, as two local businessmen 
discovered this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Altman and Ryan Christensen, who describe themselves as patriots, 
proposed hoisting Old Glory aloft on 18 flagpoles at their new tire store on 
West Lincoln Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials shot down their plans, citing a 27-year-old sign and banner 
ordinance that includes a provision forbidding the display of more than three 
American flags on a lot at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was flabbergasted," said Christensen, 33, a former Eagle Scout who 
continues to work for the Boy Scouts of America and co-owns the tire franchise 
with Altman. "I can't fathom a city putting a restriction on the (number) of 
American flags you can put on display. It's just a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials explained that the code is designed to reduce visual clutter, 
not to discourage enthusiasm for the national emblem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really for aesthetics," city planner Greg Hastings said. "Sure, there's 
a limit. I think it's just a matter of being reasonable. I don't think the 
intent is to not be patriotic." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman and Christensen, however, intend to ignore the ordinance and vow that 
next week the 18 American flags will proudly salute anyone who drives by their 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to do it no matter what," said Altman, 32, who served in the 
Navy. "I'm a U.S. citizen, pal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to surround my property with as many flags as I can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pair could face a fine of as much as $1,000 and up to six months in 
jail if cited for the misdemeanor violation, city authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be time and money well spent," said Christensen, an Anaheim 
resident. "If that's what it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman and Christensen contend that three flags just won't instill the sense 
of national pride that 18 flags would convey. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it down in San Diego," Christensen said of a tire store he managed 
there. "There were people that weren't even customers who would come in and 
compliment us on how many flags we were flying. It heightens patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials respond that three banners are plenty, pointing to City 
Hall, where the U.S., state and city flags fly. Officials suggest business 
owners who want to raise more may have an additional motive -- profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be reasonable," said Hastings. "If someone wants to put up 25 
flags to attract customers off the freeway for their tire sale, that's just 
excessive." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman and Christensen say the American flags are in keeping with the 
advertisements of their company, Big O Tires, which emphasizes that its 
products are made in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see if they didn't want us to put up Big O flags," Christensen said. 
"But how can you squawk about putting up American flags? To me, it just doesn't 
sound right."

4 HELD IN PROTEST OF BAN ON LATINO CLUB AT COLLEGE; DEMONSTRATION: THEY ARE 
AMONG ABOUT 80 STUDENTS RALLYING OUTSIDE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE TO HAVE MECHA 
REINSTATED AT GOLDEN WEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Four student demonstrators were arrested Thursday after an angry four-hour 
protest over the removal of a Latino club at Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the demonstrators had chained themselves together at the wrists and 
seated themselves in front of a window in President Philip Westin's office 
while a crowd of about 80 protested outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth was arrested after he and about a dozen others linked arms and 
blocked a back entrance to Westin's office, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally outside the president's office began around noon and had dwindled to 
about 15 people when more than 35 police officers in riot gear arrived with a 
dog about 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had received calls from frightened faculty members, and several offices 
had been shut down, Westin said. One class was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 The police ordered the remaining demonstrators to disperse or be arrested, and 
they did. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were protesting Westin's order in spring banning the MEChA 
(Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan) club on campus unless new officers 
were elected and a new adviser chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Westin said MEChA was suspended for "inappropriate actions," including a 
scholarship fund-raiser on campus at which alcohol was consumed. The club also 
boycotted a recruitment drive aimed at attracting Latino students to the 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 The students claim that only one person at the fund-raiser was drinking, that 
he was not a member and that they reported him to campus police. 
</P>
<P>
 The club boycotted the college's recruitment drive in April because it was not 
allowed to organize the event as it had for the previous 20 years, said Ana 
Carbajal, 28, one of those arrested.  
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference after the rally ended, Westin said he would not rescind 
the disciplinary action against the club and would consider possible 
disciplinary action against those arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the students canceled a 24-hour vigil and rally because an 
Orange County Superior Court judge granted the college a restraining order 
prohibiting MEChA from demonstrating for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The other arrestees are Lupe Lopez, 21, of Stanton, a former president of the 
club; Claudia Rochin, 20, of Westminster, and David Rojas, 22, of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas was booked on suspicion of resisting arrest and prohibiting police 
activity, all misdemeanors. The three women were booked on suspicion of 
trespassing and disrupting campus business, also misdemeanors. Rochin is also 
charged with suspicion of felony assault on a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 All were being held Thursday night at the Huntington Beach Jail pending $500 
bail, except Rochin, whose bail was set at $10,000, according to Lt. Jeff Cope. 
</P>
<P>
 The women, who were dragged from the president's office into a room out of 
public view, said police used excessive force. As she was being escorted off 
campus, Lopez said, officers "pulled my hair and kicked my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 "The three females were asked to willingly leave the president's office," Cope 
said. "They refused. . . . We made a tactical decision to create a distraction 
to take them out of view of the crowd, dismantle their chains" and arrest them. 
</P>
<P>
 The women "basically were marketing themselves to entice the crowd," Capt. Ed 
McErlain said. "By removing them, we removed part of the problem. . . . Not one 
of them was mishandled." 
</P>
<P>
 One arresting officer suffered minor wounds to his right forearm when one of 
the women scratched him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for MEChA, Alfredo Amezcua, said: "I think the students are very 
angry and they have the right to be angry and express their opinions. 
Hopefully, the college will realize the magnitude of the problem. . . . We do 
have a very explosive situation here."

RAMS LOOK AT RE-SIGNING HENLEY IF RULES EASED; SPORTS: TEAM WILL HELP POST 
$2-MILLION BOND IF THE CORNERBACK, ACCUSED OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, CAN TRAVEL 
WITHOUT A FEDERAL OFFICER AS AN ESCORT, ATTORNEYS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Attorneys for former Rams cornerback Darryl Henley said Thursday the team is 
interested in re-signing the embattled cornerback and would help him post $2 
million in bail if he can travel to road games without being shadowed by a 
federal court officer as prosecutors want. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley was cut from the team on Sunday, his attorneys said, "after the Rams 
determined that the presence of a pretrial services escort would cause undue 
disruption to the team's ability to prepare for, and play in, the games in 
question." 
</P>
<P>
 If U.S. District Judge Gary L. Taylor does not modify the proposed conditions 
of the player's bail, "Mr. Henley will lose his job with the Los Angeles Rams," 
the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said last week that in addition to the escort, who would be required to 
follow Henley at all times -- even sitting with him on the bench during games 
-- Henley or a "responsible third party" such as the Rams would have to post 
bond in the amount of $1 million before he would relax a ban on travel outside 
the Santa Ana court's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after that ruling, Taylor ordered Henley's attorneys to explain why 
they thought his bail should not be raised to $1 million, even if he could not 
travel with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since his arrest late last year, Henley has been restricted from 
traveling out of the Central District of California, which includes Orange and 
Los Angeles counties, as a condition of his bail.  
</P>
<P>
 His arrest followed his indictment, along with several others, on charges that 
he conspired to run a cocaine ring by using a former Rams cheerleader to 
deliver the drugs to drop-off points in Memphis and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's original bail was set at $200,000, but attorneys for other defendants 
who were denied bail complained that the football player was getting special 
treatment. Last week, Taylor expressed concerns about Henley's bail being too 
low. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald L. Chaleff, one of Henley's attorneys, said the Rams are now willing to 
post a $2-million travel bond, with a justified affidavit of surety, and Henley 
would provide the court with a $200,000 cash deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaleff noted that the $200,000 would constitute the majority of the $350,000 
yearly salary that Henley would be paid if the Rams were to re-sign him. 
Henley's family posted his present $200,000 bond after Henley was arrested last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In place of the court officer the judge presently favors, Henley's attorneys 
proposed relying instead on the off-duty Anaheim police officer who normally 
travels with the team and makes sure that each player has made his bed check. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because an off-duty officer from the Anaheim Police Department normally 
travels with the Rams for security reasons, his presence (unlike that of a 
member of pretrial services) will not be disruptive to the team," Chaleff 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the National Football League security team will also help ensure 
that Henley meets all of the court's requirements, Chaleff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors are expected to formally respond to Chaleff's legal papers 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assistant U.S. Atty. Deirdre Z. Eliot said the government, which considers 
Henley a major player in a serious drug case, favors a federal escort, and is 
opposed to Henley being watched only by an off-duty police officer who travels 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides are scheduled to meet on the matter Wednesday in Taylor's court, 
but Henley's attorneys have asked that the situation be resolved before then, 
because "it will determine Mr. Henley's ability to return quickly to his 
employment with the Los Angeles Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley and his attorneys continue to insist that the cornerback is not a 
flight risk and no danger to the community. In fact, they say, he has made all 
court appearances and met all conditions of his bail. Taylor even granted 
Henley permission to travel to a family wedding in Waco, Tex., on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the Rams are willing to post a bond of the magnitude here 
proposed is a reflection of their strong and unwavering belief that Mr. Henley 
both recognizes his obligations to this court and intends to comply with them," 
Chaleff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Taylor ordered that a pretrial services officer keep Henley's salary 
in an escrow account and distribute it to him as needed, Chaleff said the court 
officer may not be able to do so legally and asked that a trust account be set 
up for Henley to get portions of his salary approved by the court.

VACATIONING LOTTO WINNER CLAIMS $12.6-MILLION PRIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly a month after striking it rich, 65-year-old Buena Park resident Joan 
Markham has claimed her $12.6-million Super Lotto jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're extremely pleased that the winner has come forward," said State Lottery 
spokesman Bob Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyebrows were raised early last month when the much-publicized award went 
unclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's been really concerned," said Erik Walters, a clerk at Bay Crest 
Spirits and Wine Shop on 17th Street in Costa Mesa, where Markham purchased 10 
computerized Quick Pick tickets at $1 apiece the afternoon of Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten to the point where you can read people's minds before they ask 
you," Walters said. "Everyone who's come in has asked about it; we kept 
wondering why someone wouldn't have come forward." 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, Taylor said, Markham -- who is retired -- was on vacation. Late 
Thursday afternoon, however, she returned and reported to the Super Lotto's 
district office in Santa Ana to claim her prize. 
</P>
<P>
 The new multimillionaire could not be reached for comment Thursday and, 
according to Taylor, had expressed an adamant desire not to speak to the press. 
"She's very, very spooked by this," he said. "This is a lot of notoriety to 
achieve suddenly upon returning from vacation." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood at Bay Crest Spirits and Wine Shop, on the other hand, was almost 
buoyant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great," said Joe Spadafore, owner of the 40-year-old liquor 
store since 1990. "I hope it affects her life in a super positive manner; it's 
kind of nice that the money didn't get lost in space." 
</P>
<P>
 The place has sold two other winning tickets, Spadafore said; one worth $3 
million in 1989, and another worth $6 million in 1990. That year, he said, the 
store placed among the top 50 retailers in the state for selling lottery 
tickets, although its sales so far this year have not placed it among the top 
100. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't bother Spadafore, whose business grossed $300,000 in lottery 
ticket sales last year. Each retailer receives 6% of the price of each ticket 
sold. On winning tickets, Taylor said, they take one-half of 1% of the total 
amount won which, in the recent case, amounts to $63,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money's going into a mutual fund for my kids' college educations," 
Spadafore said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Taylor, Markham's gross earnings will amount to an annuity of 
$631,000 a year for 20 years, or $454,320 after taxes. The next Lotto jackpot, 
he said, will be at least $30 million.

FALL ENROLLMENT DIPS AT VALLEY'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES; EDUCATION: DECLINE IS 
BLAMED ON THE LOSS OF POTENTIAL STUDENTS FORCED TO MOVE BECAUSE OF QUAKE 
DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a continuing decline that officials blame on the lingering impact of the 
Northridge earthquake, initial enrollments are down again this fall at all 
three San Fernando Valley campuses in the Los Angeles Community College 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce College in Woodland Hills suffered the largest drop of the district's 
nine campuses. Pierce's day-to-day enrollment totals are running 6% to 7% below 
corresponding days a year ago, district officials said, despite the naming of a 
new acting president last spring whose goal was to increase enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollments at Valley College in Van Nuys this week, the second of the 
semester, are running about 4% below last year's levels. The numbers at Mission 
College in Sylmar are down 1% to 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Total district enrollment as of Tuesday was down 1% to 101,461, its lowest 
level since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 District Interim Chancellor Neil Yoneji blamed the 6.8 magnitude earthquake on 
Jan. 17 for the weak showings of the Valley colleges. Because the quake wrecked 
many Valley area homes and apartments, it forced potential students for the 
three colleges out of the area, Yoneji said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Los Angeles riots, which damaged mostly businesses, the earthquake 
caused extensive damage to residences in the Valley that may result in a dip in 
enrollments through this and the next school year, Yoneji said. 
</P>
<P>
 George Prather, a senior research analyst for the district, predicted that the 
final districtwide enrollment for the fall semester, calculated later this 
month, will remain slightly less than last year's. Without the quake, he said, 
total enrollment would have risen slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, district officials said they were heartened at the relatively 
small districtwide loss, especially coming on the heels of an 11% drop in the 
fall of 1993 and a nearly 2% decline in the fall of 1992 after state fee 
increases. This summer, the Legislature kept community college fees at $13 per 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday, Pierce's enrollment was 15,077, its lowest fall level since 
1969. The college, which once had the district's largest enrollment, now ranks 
fourth after declines in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley, now ranked first in enrollment, had 16,004 students this week. This 
fall's decline, after drops in the past two years, has brought the college's 
enrollment to its lowest level since 1966, district records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission, now ranked eighth of nine district colleges in enrollment, had 5,814 
students this week, its lowest level since 1990. The college had been growing 
rather steadily until last fall, when it suffered an enormous 18% drop in 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Among enrollments at the district's other campuses, East Los Angeles is up 
about 8%, West Los Angeles is up about 3% and City is up about 1%. Harbor is 
down about 1% and Southwest and Trade-Tech are down about 4%, according to 
district records.

violence, is now exporting peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Gary Loster and seven other civic leaders from crime-plagued Saginaw, 
Mich., came to the San Fernando Valley on Thursday to see how a group of 
volunteer activists organized a groundbreaking truce among Latino gangs. The 
cease-fire just passed its 10-month anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've heard and had a chance to see is outstanding," said Loster, after 
spending several hours in discussions at the Jet Center gym in Van Nuys. The 
gym is co-owned by William (Blinky) Rodriguez, a moving force in the truce that 
for almost a year has helped prevent gang-on-gang killings in some of the 
city's toughest neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be taking these things back and try to put things together," Loster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the United States' poorest communities, Saginaw is one of many 
Midwestern cities that flourished and suffered with the American automobile 
industry. Its population, once more than 100,000, has shrunk to 70,000 and more 
than half the residents are identified as lower or moderate income. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, its crime rate was listed at almost twice the national average. 
Things bottomed that summer when a series of six shootings in a single week 
shocked the town into action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community became enraged," said Loster. "For a small city, six or seven 
murders is a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The city initiated an innovative crime and gang task force that included 
representatives of federal, state and local law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, crime rates have begun falling again. Since April, there has been 
a 60% decline in homicides and a 20% reduction in felonious assaults. Now, 
Loster wants to take the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go into prevention and intervention, where we can begin to work 
with our young people like you're doing here," he said to about a dozen people 
sitting on metal chairs in a back room at the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, whose son was killed in a drive-by shooting four years ago, 
described the events that led him and a colleague, Donald Garcia, to bring 
representatives of gangs throughout the Valley together last Halloween to make 
peace. He also talked about how difficult it has been to keep the truce going, 
to prevent insignificant snubs and slights from flaring into violent 
confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 "An ongoing spirit of violence has been destroying this community for a number 
of years," Rodriguez said. "Youths were getting high on the violence." 
</P>
<P>
 He said a key to keeping the peace has been the respect gang members give to 
him and Garcia, a onetime gang leader who spent much of his life in prison 
before reforming, and the other hand-picked activists. Also important has been 
the willingness of activists like brothers Steve and Alex Martinez to climb out 
of bed to mediate disputes before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our slogan has been: 'No mothers crying, no babies dying,' " said Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Police statistics bear out the results. During the first six months of the 
year, violent crime fell 12% valleywide. In the Foothill Division in the 
northeast Valley, homicides fell from 24 to seven, which police attribute 
primarily to the truce. 
</P>
<P>
 Loster and the others took notes and the daughter of another Saginaw civic 
leader, who used to live in Sylmar, filmed the session with a hand-held video 
camera. The civic leader, Dee Guerrero, had touted the truce to other Saginaw 
officials, and they decided to look at it firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can see the excitement," Loster said. "We can feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 Also attending the meeting was Marco Torres, a representative of Los Angeles 
City Councilman Richard Alarcon. "This is one of the council member's biggest 
priorities," Torres told Loster. "A handful of guys have done what 
organizations getting millions of dollars since the 1970s" failed to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said one thing the organizers have succeeded in doing has been to 
change the gang culture in a fundamental way by showing gang leaders that it's 
not heroic to drive by someone's house and shoot out the window. "The message 
is out there: 'If you use a gun, you're a coward.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As they have all along, however, Rodriguez, Garcia and the other activists 
took little credit Thursday for the truce. Rodriguez credits God's 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to define the terms," he said to Loster, "it is men of God 
standing up and being obedient to the call in perilous times." 
</P>
<P>
 Loster nodded. What it all comes down to, he said later, "is what Blinky said 
so well. No mothers crying, no babies dying."

 More than $10,000 was raised for the city's cultural arts programs at the 
"Brea Fest: A Taste of the Arts" celebration. This annual event, which drew 
more than 4,000 people, was held Aug. 26 at the Brea Civic & Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was our most successful year" in terms of both revenue and talent, 
festival manager Kathie DeRobbio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds were generated from food-tasting booths operated by 29 area restaurants 
and food distributors who donated their products and services. Some of the 
performers donated their time, and others were sponsored by local businesses. 
There were also 150 volunteers working at the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival proceeds will support cultural activities sponsored by the city, 
including art exhibits at the Brea Gallery, performances at the Curtis Theatre, 
and seasonal programs such as concerts in the park and the "Family Fridays" 
movie series. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is also designed to help make the community aware of cultural 
opportunities in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's festival featured musical and dance performances on three outdoor 
stages. There were also presentations by the Brea Civic Light Opera and the 
Brea Youth Theatre, children's activities, art demonstrations and an exhibit of 
works created by physically and developmentally impaired artists. ALAN EYERLY

 Once a week, Kim Weggeland meets up with a special friend to talk.  
</P>
<P>
 Their hourlong conversations are freewheeling. Weggeland might talk about her 
upcoming wedding. Her friend, an elderly woman, might discuss plans for the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair was brought together two months ago through a YMCA community outreach 
program that matches senior citizens with younger people. 
</P>
<P>
 Weggeland, a 31-year-old Newport Beach sales manager, said she and her match 
had an instant rapport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's working out great," she said. "We talk about everything." 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen senior citizens from throughout Orange County take part in the 
program. Organizers are now looking for more volunteers to spend one day a week 
with senior citizens. A training class for participants will be held Sept. 21 
in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Elana Peters, a coordinator of Project Reach Out for Seniors, said lonely 
elderly people benefit from having regular visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives them something to look forward to each week," said Peters. "We find 
that many seniors are isolated. This causes depression and loneliness. I think 
this adds to their aging and (can cause them) to go downhill physically more 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The program provides matches for seniors who live in homes or nursing 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Both seniors and volunteers fill out questionnaires that program organizers 
use to make the matches. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer workshop will be at 6:30 p.m. Sept. 21 in the YMCA Community 
Counseling Services Office, Building 2, at Red Hill Avenue and Main Street in 
Irvine. For more information, call (714) 253-4140. 
</P>
<P>
 Each volunteer must be willing to spend at least an hour a week with a senior 
and stay with the program for at least six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters and Weggeland said volunteers also reap rewards from the service. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives you a better sense of yourself and a better understanding of 
seniors," Peters said. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; PLAY BEARS A MESSAGE FOR YOUTHS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, Goldilocks worried only whether the porridge was too hot to 
eat, or the bed too hard to provide a decent nap. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a new play aimed at steering youngsters away from guns, drugs and 
gangs, Goldilocks' main concern is keeping Baby Bear out of trouble, in school 
and headed to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Olivos Jr.'s play, "Goldilocks and the Three Bears, 10 Years Later," was 
funded by $2,000 in Community Development Block Grant money. 
</P>
<P>
 The 54-year-old Olivos, who is also directing the production, said its message 
is especially important to him because his own brother was killed in a drive-by 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 To help prevent others from suffering a similar loss, Olivos said he wants to 
provide potential gang members an alternative outlet for their energies and 
also stress the importance of education through theater. 
</P>
<P>
 When the show is ready, the group will perform it at local intermediate 
schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast includes several inner-city youngsters who said the play gives them a 
constructive way to spend their time and keeps them out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariana Paz, 13, who plays Goldilocks, said that being in the play "has 
changed me a lot. I used to get into trouble all the time because I can't 
control my temper. But I sort of got the message out of this." 
</P>
<P>
 In the play, Goldilocks meets the ghost of a gang member who was killed in a 
shooting. The boy witnesses his own funeral and tries to converse with weeping 
family members but cannot be heard. Goldilocks, the only one who can see him, 
reminds him of all the family events he will never join. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariana said the play will be more effective at reaching young audiences than 
lectures from a parent or teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hear, 'Stay away from gangs, stay away from guns, stay away from drugs,' 
but they never pay attention. But when they watch the play they see that this 
could happen to them and it can get it into their heads," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first show, a $25-per-ticket fund-raiser to pay for future productions, 
will be on Sept. 30 at 7 p.m. at Casa Santa Fe, 1000 E. Santa Ana Blvd. JON

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PROGRAM HELPS FIND HOMES FOR MORE PETS

 Euthanasia may soon be a thing of the past at the West Valley Animal Shelter 
and Control Center in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal control officers and volunteers at the West Valley shelter have 
pioneered a mobile pet adoption program showcasing orphaned dogs and cats at 
malls and pet food stores that has dramatically decreased the need to put their 
animals to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Aggressive tactics such as the mobile program, in addition to the volunteers' 
commitment to finding homes for the animals, have reduced the euthanasia rate 
by more than 70% at the West Valley shelter, according to Animal Control 
Officer Tim Goffa. 
</P>
<P>
 District Supervisor George Weissman said that he foresees other shelters in 
Los Angeles trying the mobile adoption program. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the success they have been having, I can't see it going any other way," 
Weissman said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 21, West Valley joined up with the West Los Angeles shelter to 
showcase 41 animals at the Century City Shopping Center. All but three cats 
were adopted, said West Valley volunteer Judy Levine. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 10, the shelter is hosting an open house and on the following day, 
they are taking some animals to the Discount Pet Food store in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at the shelter itself, volunteers like Levine are always working on 
keeping the animals from being put down. Levine helped arrange a two-week stay 
of execution for Vivian, a shepherd-mix that had been left tied to the flagpole 
in front of the shelter with her ear badly mangled from a fight with another 
animal. Levine offered to tend to Vivian's wounds whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also want to find homes for the older animals," Levine said, explaining 
that many people come to shelters looking for puppies or kittens and don't want 
a pet that will die after just a year. "I want to educate people that it's OK 
to adopt an older pet. . . . They are great animals." 
</P>
<P>
 While the volunteers and employees are all eager to find their animals homes, 
they are committed to finding them good homes. Levine and her colleagues make 
follow-up calls to all new pet guardians to make sure the animals are being 
adequately cared for. MAKI BECKER

 "The world shook Northridge, then Northridge shook the world," read the 
placards of fans celebrating the return of the Northridge Little League 
all-stars to their home diamond on Devonshire Street. After capturing the 
national Little League title and barely losing the World Series to a Venezuelan 
team, the players have enjoyed a level of celebrity that serves as a poignant 
backdrop to the Major League Baseball strike. With more than 250 scheduled 
games canceled as a result of the strike thus far, players and fans have been 
forced to occupy themselves in some other way. The success of the Northridge 
team fills a gap for local baseball aficionados hit by both the strike and the 
Jan 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 What defines the spirit of baseball? 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Wold, former pitcher and coach for the Northridge team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that, for the kids, the spirit of baseball lies within the parent. I 
see more parents participating now than I have in a long time. If you drive by 
the field before the season starts, you'll see a group of dads out there 
working with their kids. We never worked out when I was a kid. Today, there are 
schools and camps around for private lessons.  
</P>
<P>
 "But (in the major leagues), baseball is less team-oriented and more of an 
endorsement game these days. . . . This affects the kids playing today who want 
to emulate the flashy players. They tend to do the same things (the big 
leaguers) do. The worst thing is theway that these kids think they should 
charge the mound when they get hit by a pitch. They see highlight films with a 
series of guys charging the pitcher and think it's part of baseball now. That's 
not baseball. What's part of the ball game is that you are going to get hit 
every now and then." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Rich, chairman of the Cal State Northridge sociology department  
</P>
<P>
 "(All) sports are an outlet in our society. They're a great way to relieve 
stress as a player or a fan. Sociologists study the effect of sports on 
different groups and communities. We look at the effects that sports have on 
the community and how they enhance camaraderie. (In that sense), if it weren't 
for the earthquake, the Northridge Little League team wouldn't have received 
the exposure it did. Because the area is perceived as somewhat of a victim, the 
Northridge team, known as the 'The Earthquake Kids,' became a symbol of things 
coming together again for the community. Their success re-instilled a sense of 
pride in the community."  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Harris, owner of the Baseball Card Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a collectible standpoint, the strike has done a lot of damage. Both 
(Chicago White Sox first baseman) Frank Thomas and (Seattle Mariners center 
fielder) Ken Griffey Jr. were trading really well before the strike and now 
people just aren't that interested. Having the Northridge Little League team on 
television, though, was the best. We had people coming in here who became true 
Northridge fans. Such exposure probably wouldn't have happened if Major League 
Baseball was still running. In that aspect, the strike has done well for little 
league baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Willard, professor of philosophy at USC 
</P>
<P>
 "You see the two extremes in the feeling and thinking about baseball with both 
the strike and the Northridge team. I've had people who were watching the 
Little League series come up to me and say, 'This is what it's all about.' They 
don't understand how people with salaries of over $1 million cannot just enjoy 
a game when these kids play for free. But to seek to get whatever you can get 
for something of value is an American ideal. It's an insolvable tension in our 
society -- to play sports for sports sake or to make money off of sports.  
</P>
<P>
 "When the Northridge kids won, everyone was gratified because . . . it looked 
like the right people won. With (major league) owners and players, there 
doesn't seem to be a right person."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; JUDGE OKS SCHOOL TRASH CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge brought Santa Ana's garbage war to an 
end Thursday by ruling that the school district is entitled to hire its own 
trash hauler despite the city's exclusive franchise agreement with Great 
Western Reclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 The city teamed up in March with Great Western and sued family-run 5 Star 
Rubbish, to which the school district had granted a contract to haul waste from 
the district's 50 schools. Judge Thomas N. Thrasher later ordered the school 
district added to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Otting, owner of 5 Star Rubbish, said Thrasher's decision in its favor 
was a victory for small business and free enterprise.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy that we have a court system in Orange County that still 
continues to work for the small people," Otting said. "That's how I basically 
feel, that the people won this time -- that big business can't buy everything." 
 
</P>
<P>
 The city and Great Western had argued that 5 Star and the school district 
violated a city ordinance granting exclusive trash collection rights within the 
city to Great Western, which has hauled the city's garbage for three decades. 
It is a subsidiary of behemoth Waste Management Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 They also argued that by putting its trash contract out to bid, the school 
district hobbled the city's ability to comply with state recycling laws set 
forth under the Integrated Waste Management Act. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thrasher's summary judgment said the school district is a separate entity 
that has the right and responsibility to put its own contracts to bid. He also 
said that all local districts share the responsibility of meeting state 
recycling mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling brings to an end a standoff between city and school officials over 
whether the district could arrange for its own trash-collection service. After 
months of haggling last year, the district ultimately decided to go with the 
advice of its attorneys and awarded Otting and 5-Star Rubbish the $200,000 
annual contract on Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials, who say they are saving nearly $900,000 over a five-year 
period by contracting with 5 Star, applauded Thrasher's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel really encouraged by what we got," said Bill Moncure, the district's 
director of purchasing.  
</P>
<P>
 "If it would have gone against us, it would have cost us a lot of money. It's 
taxpayers' money, and that's really the kids' money, bottom line. We can 
convert that to textbooks and things that we really need in schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western Reclamation President Robert J. Coyle said the only reason 
Otting was able to underbid Great Western for the school contract was that her 
company does not meet city requirements for recycling.  
</P>
<P>
 "The real question is, who is responsible for meeting recycling requirements?" 
Coyle said. "If the school district has its own responsibility to meet 
recycling law, I think both the city and the school district and Waste 
Management Inc. will understand that and work toward bidding in that 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Edward J. Cooper vowed to appeal Thrasher's decision. LEE ROMNEY

<P>
 Artists, cooks, actors, bands and even some live bees will compete for the 
attention of the 350,000 people expected to attend the 22nd annual Orange 
International Street Fair this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival begins at 5 tonight, with opening ceremonies at 7, and concludes 
Sunday night at 10.This year's theme -- "A Family Affair" -- was chosen to 
emphasize the ethnic diversity of the county, said fair spokesman Marshall 
Feduk. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the event will benefit 47 nonprofit organizations, and all of 
the fair committee members have volunteered their time, Feduk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival grounds center on the Old Towne Plaza traffic circle at Chapman 
Avenue and Glassell Street. They extend to Grand Street on the east, Lemon 
Street on the west, Maple Avenue on the north and Almond Avenue on the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults can obtain bracelets that will allow them to buy alcohol on the 
festival grounds. Sale of all liquor stops at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Maps and information are at Old Towne Plaza. Those seeking restrooms or 
wheelchair access should head that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Food from various booths includes gyros, teriyaki sticks, bratwurst, 
quesadillas and sushi. Ethnic booths will be judged at noon Saturday for best 
use of theme or best display of ethnic costume. 
</P>
<P>
 A wide range of music will be offered on nine stages throughout the grounds 
during the event. The main stage, where ceremonies will open the festival, is 
at Old Towne Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 A children's village, located on the grass of the circle, will include music 
and storytellers and a variety of crafts people to help kids create their own 
works. A hive of live bees will be displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 70 crafts booths will offer art and ceramics during the weekend.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Students who plan to attend Cesar Chavez High School for the 1994-95 school 
year should make appointments to pick up registration materials, a spokeswoman 
for the Santa Ana Unified School District said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students can call (714) 566-8418 by Tuesday for an appointment.After that 
date, students should go to the campus, at 2128 S. Cypress St., spokeswoman 
Diane Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative education school -- the system's 44th and newest campus -- is 
open to all high school students in the district. It will open Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 To register at the district's other high schools, students must return 
completed enrollment forms, which are included in registration packets. 
Returning students should have received those packets in the mail, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students new to the district can pick up the packets by going to their new 
schools, but they must also provide immunization records and transcripts from 
the school they previously attended. Students who are transferring within the 
district do not need to provide transcripts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 All campuses that are not on year-round schedules open Sept. 8, Thomas 
said.JON NALICK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CHAMBER RELOCATES SO REPAIRS CAN BEGIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Chamber of Commerce has moved out of the South Brand 
Boulevard building owned by the city so that earthquake repairs can be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Cohen, chief executive officer of the chamber, said the office moved 
last week so the city could replace five walls for about $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an old fire station," Cohen said. "Most of the fire station held up 
very well." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the building suffered a lot of cosmetic damage from the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake. The building is being repaired now, after other more 
seriously damaged city-owned buildings have been repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were ready to go almost a month ago," Cohen said. But chamber officials 
asked the city to delay the repairs until now so the chamber could hold major 
events such as the San Fernando Fiesta. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber has had to compromise for the move from 519 S. Brand Blvd. to the 
temporary office at 444 South Brand, Suite 201, because the temporary office 
has much less space than the other location. 
</P>
<P>
 The repairs are expected to take four to six weeks. The phone number for the 
chamber remains the same, (818) 361-1184 or fax at (818) 898-1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Business is expected to continue as usual, Cohen said. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; GROUP CRITICAL OF REDEVELOPMENT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Community Redevelopment Agency this week released a draft plan for 
creating a redevelopment area in Sherman Oaks, but community leaders say it 
fails to adequately address their demand that the public have a say in the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the ways the CRA may solicit public comments is by appointing a 
community advisory committee, according to the draft plan, which was issued 
Tuesday.The tentative plan also calls for building more affordable housing, 
improving streets and sewers, and requiring all new development to comply with 
the redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The community advisory committee concept "is a good idea, but it doesn't go 
far enough," said Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks homeowners' 
group. "This committee will have no power except to indicate what it wants. The 
CRA can completely disregard those goals." 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake inflicted massive damage on buildings in Sherman Oaks, which 
subsequently suffered economic aftershocks as well.  
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment would mean an infusion of much-needed dollars for rebuilding, 
but skeptics fear that it could have negative repercussions on Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leader Jeff Brain said if the Los Angeles City Council approves the 
plan, he would like it to adopt a companion ordinance that specifies what 
improvements would be made in the redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community will attempt to take all the planning issues and decisions out 
of the hands of the CRA," Brain said. "(The CRA's) only role would be a funding 
role, collecting the tax increment and funding a bond issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The money for redevelopment would come from the tax increment, or the increase 
in property taxes expected as a result of redevelopment. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CLASSES TO CURB TEEN PREGNANCY EXPANDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A statewide teen pregnancy prevention program will be extended to San Fernando 
Valley junior high schools, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, dubbed Education Now And Babies Later (ENABL), will serve about 
5,000 youths at eleven middle schools, teaching seventh-grade students in 
health classes to postpone sexual involvement until marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "There weren't a lot of teen pregnancy prevention programs in the Valley and 
we want to deal with prevention," said Alexx Tobeck ENABL project coordinator, 
who said in 1992 there were 1,686 births to teen-age mothers 18 and younger in 
the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior high schools participating in the program are James Madison, Walter 
Reed, Pacoima, San Fernando, Richard E. Byrd, Olive Vista, Van Nuys, William 
Mulholland, Mt. Gleason, Charles Maclay, and Francisco Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is free to students with their parents' permission. Each school 
will allow parents to review the materials before the instruction begins in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating schools will also offer a parent communication workshop, which 
Tobeck said is crucial to improving dialogue about sex between students and 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of parents are real uncomfortable about how to talk to their teens 
about sex and sexual issues," said Tobeck. "But teens will get the information 
somewhere, and it's usually not the information the parents want them to have." 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the program, students will conduct role-playing exercises and skits to 
learn how to reject sexual advances without hurting someone's feelings. They 
will also learn how to avoid peer pressure and media influence that encourage 
premarital sex, Tobeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Begun in 1991, the state-funded, $5-million ENABL program has reached 185,000 
students in junior high schools across California. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Valley effort is being run by the nonprofit El Nido Family Centers and 
the Northeast Valley Health Corp. with a $315,000 grant from the California 
Office of Family Planning. The program will run for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on the ENABL program, or to enroll a student, contact the 
participating school in your area or Tobeck at El Nido Family Center, (818) 
908-5003. JEFF SCHNAUFER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA NEWPORT BEACH; PANEL SEEKS $130,000 FOR ARTS IN 
SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District is expected to authorize spending 
$130,000 to expand fine arts programs in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to scarce funding for arts programs, some deteriorating equipment has 
become a safety concern, arts task force Chairwoman Loretta Robinson told the 
board at its meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the district's spring choral program at the Loats Performing Arts Center at 
Newport Harbor High School, for example, the stage started to collapse beneath 
the 200 student singers, said Eleanor Anderson, the district's director of 
curriculum and assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 260 kids on the stage on platforms and risers. One of the platforms on 
which the risers were placed gave way. It caused the kids on one set of risers 
to suddenly drop about a foot," Anderson said. "None of them fell or were 
injured, but there was a gasp from the kids and the audience as this thing 
dropped like an elevator."  
</P>
<P>
 Board member Judith A. Franco said that incident in April spurred public 
support for financing arts programs, in part because the performers were such 
troupers that they continued singing through the mishap.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the excitement really started with the Music Festival, where we 
almost lost some children," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, the board offered to finance part of the program expansion with 
interest earned from the Irvine Endowment for arts education. The board asked a 
task force of 30 fine arts teachers to review the district's needs and come up 
with recommendations. Robinson, who was just voted the county's Fine Arts 
Teacher of the Year, presented the panel's findings Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the money -- $71,558 -- should be used to buy musical instruments 
to expand music programs at the sixth-grade level and beyond, the panel said. 
Another $21,900 was requested to refurbish the Loats Performing Arts Center 
with new risers, stage platforms and high-tech electronic equipment to enhance 
offstage direction ability. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also requested new pulleys and an inspection for the entire stage 
rigging system, bracing for electric pipe and ladder cable pulleys, and lighter 
counterweights for some of the pulley systems as items needed to make the 
auditorium safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said the music festival incident was a wake-up call to at least 
replace deteriorating equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things like that do happen, but it really pointed up how much we need to 
improve that auditorium," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The balance of the funds would pay for teacher in-service training, as well as 
pottery-making and audiovisual equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 A formal request for the money goes before the board for approval Sept. 13.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; AEROB-A-THON RAISES FUNDS FOR MDA RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Jerry Lewis never looked this good, but he would have been proud. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty hard bodies sweated Wednesday night to the latest hip-hop tunes -- all 
in the name of muscular dystrophy research. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerobic enthusiasts gathered at L.A. Fitness, where the Woodland Hills workout 
center hosted an Aerob-a-thon to raise money for neuromuscular disease 
research. The event was the first of its kind held in the San Fernando Valley, 
according to the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Health club General Manager Chris Colb said he was thrilled with the $2,000 
raised, although the total fell short of the $2,500 goal. He plans to host 
another Aerob-a-thon next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerobic coordinators, gym members and interested guests paid a $15 entry fee 
and were responsible for raising at least $25 in pledges. Individuals who 
raised the most money were awarded a mountain bike or free six-month 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muscular Dystrophy Assn. hopes to raise $46 million in contributions this 
year throughout the United States, according to Carla Macy, district director. 
Last year, $3.1 million was raised throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy said in addition to research, contributions from the Aerob-a-thon went to 
muscular dystrophy treatment clinics throughout Los Angeles County and to the 
group's summer camp for children. 
</P>
<P>
 K.C. Lee, corporate coordinator with L.A. Fitness, said the Aerob-a-thon 
attracted participants because it was a "fun way" to raise money for a good 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to do everything we could as a fitness center to support this kind 
of thing," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Davi, a Woodland Hills resident and actor known for performances in 
"Die Hard" and "Licensed to Kill," said he attended the event because he grew 
up watching Jerry Lewis telethons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I have three children of my own, and to think of them having any kind of 
disease is frightening," Davi said. "It's silly not to support something this 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 The event began with a workout-wear fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
 National aerobic champion Linda Bell of Riverside teamed up with aerobic 
dancer Denise Jones to perform and to lead a class of 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerob-a-thon participants fueled their out-of-breath bodies with black bean 
tacos, chunky salsa, vegetarian pizza and other dishes contributed by area 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "She talked me into signing up," said Jeff Lindsey, a Thousand Oaks resident 
who participated in the event with L.A. Fitness aerobics instructor Verda 
Fitzpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted him to get involved," said Fitzpatrick. "It was a healthy way for us 
to help people." ALICIA DOYLE

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PROPOSALS MADE FOR FORMER FIRE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An abandoned building that once was Glendale's main fire station could become 
a public market with vendors hawking fresh foodstuffs, or even a venue for live 
theater, under a city plan to renovate the aging structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has yet to decide what to do with the old fire station at Orange and 
Harvard streets, which has been vacant since the Fire Department opened a 
modern headquarters earlier this year. Officials say the site could either 
complement the Farmers' Market held just a few blocks away every Thursday or 
become some sort of entertainment venue. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we're not able to do at the Farmers' Market is to sell 
refrigerated goods," said Derrill Quaschnick, the city's assistant 
redevelopment director. He said the city's Redevelopment Agency has set aside 
$50,000 in its 1994-95 budget to study future uses for the fire station.  
</P>
<P>
 "With a public market, we could have a permanent installation where there 
would be fresh produce, meats, vegetables that could be available every day of 
the week." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the fire station closed, the city has received a number of suggestions 
on how to put it to use. Some city departments have asked to store equipment 
there, and the YMCA has inquired about holding a Halloween haunted house and 
Christmas tree sales on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 But ideally, Quaschnick said the city would prefer the building to become a 
permanent fixture. It is located in a four-block area that has been targeted as 
the possible site of a public-private "civic plaza" in a forthcoming plan for 
downtown redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility would be to convert the three-story building into a home for 
the Colony Theater, a repertory group based in Silver Lake that is seeking a 
permanent venue in Glendale. The city's Redevelopment Agency is providing 
financial assistance to help the group relocate, as part of the city's plan to 
establish an entertainment district downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears the building may be large enough to accommodate a theater, but 
there are several large columns and there would need to be alterations to make 
it work. It's too early to tell if it's feasible," Quaschnick said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they recently suggested the fire station as a possible 
venue to the theater group, and the group has not had time to consider it yet. 
Colony Theater representatives could not be reached for comment. STEVE RYFLE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; PROGRAM OFFERS MEALS FOR SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There aren't that many places where you can get a lunch for $1.75, says 
Frances D'Amelia, 82, a senior citizen who takes advantage of the Seniors' 
Meals Program provided by the city of Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 For those seniors who want to watch their pocketbooks and get a balanced meal 
at the same time, the meals are available Monday through Thursday at 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to meals, bingo is played on Tuesdays and Thursdays, starting at 
10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Baked lasagna, garlic bread, seasoned fresh vegetables, green beans, corn, 
hamburger and milk are just a few of the offerings at the Cultural Arts Center 
at 7800 Katella Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 35 to 125 senior citizens have been known to show up each day 
(except Fridays), said Jan Beeler, the administrative clerk for the city's 
community services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all the senior citizens can afford meals, so that's why we say it's a 
suggested donation of $1.75," Beeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the meal is only part of the bargain. At the meals program, senior 
citizens get a chance to meet each other and become friends so they don't have 
to stay home alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some good people here, we're like a family," said Lulu Garcia, 66, 
a former social worker from New York City. "Even the mayor (Sal Sapien) comes 
by to talk to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes part of the group takes trips to Laughlin or Las Vegas -- to try 
their luck at the wheel or slot machines.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; GAS STATION OFFERS DEAL IN SIGN DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the battle over freeway pole signs rages on here, one service station has 
voluntarily agreed to remove its sign in exchange for concessions from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell Oil Co. will take down its 70-foot pole sign if Agoura Hills will allow 
the firm to build a carwash and mini-mart at the site, at 5134 Kanan Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both the city and Shell are looking forward to resolving this in an amicable 
manner," said Larry Turner, an area real estate representative for Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Planning Commission will hold a public hearing on the matter Sept. 
15. But initial reaction from city officials is positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen the plans and they look terrific," said Mayor Joan Yacovone, whose 
remarks were echoed by City Manager Terry S. Matz. 
</P>
<P>
 The city banned pole signs nine years ago and gave owners seven years to 
remove them. Voters in November backed the ordinance by a 3-1 ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of pole signs say they are unsightly and spoil the scenery, while 
many businesses say they need the signs to bring in business from the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten businesses -- Chevron, Unocal, McDonald's, Texaco, Burger King, Denny's, 
Jack in the Box, Lumber City, Roadside Lumber and Fence Factory -- filed 
separate lawsuits against the city in May, charging that the ban on the signs 
will hurt their profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, a community group in Agoura Hills led a boycott against the 
businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 But some of the businesses declared the boycott a failure and vowed to 
continue their fight to keep the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said his firm decided that offering the city an agreement made more 
sense economically. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement stipulated no litigation, and if it did not make sense, we 
would not have signed it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The station will lose 25% to 30% of its business if the pole sign comes down, 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 And while it's hoped the carwash and mini-mart would help make up for that 
loss, "there are no guarantees that this sizable investment will make up for 
the loss of the sign," he said. FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; LIBRARY VOLUNTEERS GET A PAGE OF THANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At Glendale's five public libraries, the volunteers who help fill the gaps no 
longer get a mere thank you. Those who stick it out for the long run are 
immortalized -- sort of -- in the pages on the library shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials recently initiated the "100 Hour Club," a program honoring 
volunteers with a commemorative plate placed in the opening pages of a new book 
for every 100 hours they give. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was one of the nicest ways we could think of to thank people for the 
time that they give. It not only reflects that time, it says it in a book," 
said Chuck Wike, a library spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the library system's 200 volunteers, more than 40 have been honored so far 
-- and some of them have logged much more than a mere 100 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Stanley Whitsitt, for example. A die-hard film buff, Whitsitt has been 
coming to the library once a week for the past 11 years to help repair aging 
16-millimeter movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's dedicated to film. He won't even use a video camera," Wike said.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Campbell Warden, a retired man who has logged at least 2,218 
hours in the library's clerical department. At the city's Casa Verdugo branch, 
Erika Blackman has volunteered more than 1,100 hours. And the list goes on, 
library officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wike said there are several programs beginning in September with opportunities 
for people interested in volunteering with the library, including the 
"Grandparents and Books" program, operated by the library's children's services 
department; and the Adult Reading Program, which needs new tutors. Information 
can be obtained by calling (818) 548-3999. STEVE RYFLE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; STUDENTS NEUTRAL ON DRUG-SNIFFING DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few students voiced strong disapproval Thursday at the Costa Mesa Police 
Department's proposal to allow drug-sniffing dogs onto two high school 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the students interviewed at Costa Mesa and Estancia high 
schools said they were unconcerned whether Newport -- Mesa Unified School 
District trustees adopt the plan, unveiled this week by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabatha Puhl, 16, a sophomore at Costa Mesa High, said bringing drug-sniffing 
dogs onto campus would not bother her because she does not use drugs -- nor do 
most of the students, she speculated. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other students interviewed at Costa Mesa High Thursday said drug use 
occurs, but only in small groups, and is not a serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the right (to bring in drug-sniffing dogs) if they think there is 
probable cause," said Kurtis Van Horn, 16, a fullback on the school football 
team. "But we don't have a drug problem here." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board has scheduled a discussion at its Sept. 13 meeting on the 
proposal to have dogs sniff student lockers for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Police gave four school trustees a demonstration of the dogs' abilities 
Wednesday. School board members said many questions must be answered, including 
the schools' role in the program, before random searches can be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Two students, who asked to remain anonymous, said they think drug dogs on 
campus would be unfair unless the district or the schools forewarn them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Costa Mesa's head football coach, Myron Miller, said alcohol is the "real 
problem" to address on campus. Miller added, however, that he was not against 
bringing the dogs on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think alcohol is coming back," Miller said. "You hear the students 
talking." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor High School Principal Bonnie Maspero said the Newport Beach 
Police Department has not offered its canine services to Newport and Corona del 
Mar high schools. If an offer were made, the school board would have to debate 
the issue, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Police Lt. Paul Henisey said the department would consider using a dog 
on high school campuses only if asked by the district. TOM RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; WHALE FOSSIL MOVED TO SADDLEBACK COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 5-million-year-old whale discovered last week during construction of a 
church parking structure was transported Thursday to Saddleback College, where 
students will restore it for display on campus, according to a paleontologist 
in charge of the excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Borella, a professor of geology at Saddleback and the paleontologist 
monitoring construction at St. Timothy's Catholic Church on Crown Valley 
Parkway, said the college is working out an agreement with the Roman Catholic 
Diocese of Orange to have the diocese donate the whale to the college and cover 
the cost of excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowning glory of the fossil find, paleontologists said, is the whale's 
intact nine-foot skull. Borella said after the skull, with surrounding rock, 
was encased in plaster it weighed two tons. A front loader was used to lift it 
from the church grounds onto a flatbed trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 The skull was transported about five miles on surface streets to Saddleback, 
where it was unloaded with a forklift and placed outside the math sciences 
building, where it will be ultimately displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Borella said that two-thirds of the whale's original skeleton, including most 
of its spinal column, was dug out of the earth and moved in pieces to the 
campus. He said restoration of the 35-foot leviathan skeleton will be a school 
project, with students of geology, paleontology and biology 
participating.LESLIE BERKMAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; SEXUAL HARASSMENT AWARD IS UPHELD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An appeals court Thursday upheld a $195,000 jury award against the city for 
allowing the sexual harassment of a former police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Jean McClaren, 28, of Riverside accused two superior officers of 
harassing her between 1987 and 1989, when she resigned.She alleged the two men 
made lewd comments and pinched her buttocks. Despite her complaints to 
superiors, McClaren charged, the city took no action except to retaliate 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1992, a jury found that the two officers were not guilty of sexual 
harassment and initially deadlocked as to whether the city was liable for any 
of the $300,000 in damages McClaren had requested. 
</P>
<P>
 After further deliberations, the jury awarded McClaren $100,000 for emotional 
damages and another $95,000 for the premature end of her police career, as well 
as attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The city appealed the verdict to the 4th District Court of Appeal, which 
upheld the award in a 3-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Andrew Arczynski said Thursday that he has not had an 
opportunity to evaluate the ruling. McClaren's attorney was on vacation, her 
office said. MARK I. PINSKY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; FIRE-DAMAGED SCHOOL HAS ENOUGH ROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Elementary School, which was damaged by a fire in May, will have 
enough classrooms available for students when classes resume Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hatton, an assistant superintendent of the Los Alamitos United School 
District, said Thursday that some students will use the temporary classrooms 
installed following the May 8 fire that destroyed five classrooms in the 
school's north wing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The relocatable classrooms served us nicely through the remainder of (the 
last school) year," Hatton said. "We will continue to use those classrooms." 
</P>
<P>
 Students did not miss a school day as workers labored around the clock to 
install the temporary classrooms. The fire occurred on a Sunday and students 
were back on campus byMonday, school district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arson is suspected in the fire that caused an estimated $500,000 damage. 
Police are still investigating, but no arrests have been made, Los Alamitos 
police Detective Stephen Trentinisaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatton said that renovations to the school at 10862 Bloomfield Ave. will begin 
in October, or as soon as the state's architect approves the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the school district has fire insurance, Hatton said, the estimated 
$700,000 cost for repairs, including building a new wing, will not come from 
school district funds. Construction is expected to be completed in the spring, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has more than 600 students from kindergarten to fifth grade. BERT

ROHRABACHER FAILS TO DELAY $700,000 GRANT FOR EL TORO BASE CONVERSION; 
DEVELOPMENT: OFFICIALS BRISTLE AT HIS SUGGESTION THAT THE FUNDS BE WITHHELD 
UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION AND USED SOLELY TO PLAN AN AIRPORT IF VOTERS FAVOR 
SUCH A PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher said Thursday that he unsuccessfully tried to stop 
a federal planning grant for the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station until voters 
decide in November whether they want a commercial airport built there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach congressman, a strong advocate for a public airport at 
the 4,700-acre base once the military pulls out, said the recently approved 
$700,000 Defense Department grant should be used to plan a commercial airport 
if residents favor a ballot measure for such a project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it would be proper to use tax dollars to push El Toro planning 
away from a commercial airport if a solid voting majority said they wanted 
another airport there," Rohrabacher said. "It would amount to officials 
thumbing their nose at the local electorate." 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman's comments came a day after the Defense Department's Office of 
Economic Adjustment announced it would deliver the grant to Orange County's El 
Toro Reuse Planning Authority, an intergovernmental agency that will chart 
redevelopment of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding had already been delayed by nearly a year because of local 
squabbling over which political entity would control conversion planning for 
the base, scheduled to close by 1999. The grant is expected to pay for most of 
the conversion planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Bristling at Rohrabacher's actions and recommendations, county officials said 
that to tie the money exclusively to airport planning would be "irresponsible" 
even if local residents voted to place a commercial airport at the El Toro 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the initiative passes and an airport is designated for that property and 
the election passes the certain legal challenges, that would amount to setting 
aside 2,000 acres," said Kenneth H. Bruner, an aide to Board of Supervisors 
Chairman Thomas F. Riley. "How do you plan to account for the other 2,700 
acres? While we all appreciate Mr. Rohrabacher's position, I think his focus 
misses the point." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Rohrabacher been successful in further delaying the federal funding, 
Bruner said, the local planning schedule would have damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are already paying bills with that money," Bruner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher "ought to be glad he's not running for reelection in South 
County," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, whose South County supervisorial district includes El Toro, is chairman 
of the local base conversion agency and has been generally opposed to placing a 
commercial airport on El Toro property. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year, the Marine base has been at the center of a raging 
debate over how the facility should be converted when it is closed. The 
controversy has pitted airport proponents in South County who think an airport 
would upset residential communities with increased traffic and noise against 
North County leaders who believe such a development would be a boon to local 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport initiative has been largely supported by business interests, 
including some of the county's most powerful developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent of Rohrabacher's suggestions, Bruner said the county is required 
to study the possibility of using El Toro as a commercial airport site. He said 
the intergovernmental planning agency is already engaged in a review that is 
being funded by a Federal Aviation Administration grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always intended to study an airport," Bruner said. "The voters are getting 
their dollars' worth. But there still are a number of other issues to be 
studied. We have assembled a team of very responsible planners and they will do 
a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher said he communicated with Defense Department officials about the 
November airport initiative and suggested that it would be better to hold back 
the funding until after the election so that the money could be directed 
according to the voters' wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony J. Carstens, the county's director of policy research and planning, 
said Thursday that he was not aware of any restrictions on the grant funds, 
such as tying use of the money to the outcome of the election.

THERAPIST'S TREATMENT OF FEMALES CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision that state authorities described as baffling, a judge restricted 
-- but did not suspend -- an Irvine counselor's right to treat female patients 
in response to allegations he molested several patients in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Guy Venanzi, 43, a marriage, family and child counselor accused by the 
state of engaging in "repeated incompetent practice," and causing "reckless . . 
. harm" that culminated in one patient's attempted suicide, cannot see any 
female patients alone, according to the Aug. 24 order by Administrative Law 
Judge Alan S. Meth. 
</P>
<P>
 Venanzi also was barred from taking on any new female clients, and from 
engaging in any exercises that involve touching any patients. Until Nov. 20, 
however, he may, continue seeing female patients who had received treatment 
from him before July 20, according to the order. Then, he must terminate 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's decision was not explained in his written order, and he could not 
be reached late Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 Venanzi's attorney, Leslie Roe of San Diego, said Meth's decision was based in 
part on a lengthy opposition document filed in her client's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "No formal accusation has been filed" by the state, she said. "If there is a 
formal accusation, there will be a full hearing, and we believe that (Venanzi) 
will be fully vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Bonsignore, deputy director of public affairs for the state Department 
of Consumer Affairs, said, "We are absolutely baffled" by the judge's decision 
not to suspend Venanzi's license. That department oversees the Board of 
Behavioral Science Examiners, which sought interim suspension of Venanzi's 
license while a formal accusation is prepared against him. "These are serious 
charges. Everybody deserves to be innocent until proven guilty, but there was 
obviously enough evidence to issue the (suspension) order," Bonsignore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Venanzi is accused of lying under penalty of perjury to the behavioral science 
board's investigator and trying to persuade patients to lie on his behalf, 
urging one client to "misremember" his kiss, according to the state's petition 
for an interim suspension order. The therapist, described in the petition as a 
student at the Southern California Institute for Bioenergetic Analysis, 
misrepresented qualifications to a patient and an investigator, according to 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 He is accused of having a patient lie on top of him during a February session, 
after turning out the lights and getting under a blanket with her. That patient 
tried to kill herself in April after terminating therapy with Venanzi but 
continued "to be psychologically entangled with him," according to the 
petition. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another patient became suicidal after Venanzi alternately encouraged 
sexual touching during therapy, then cut it off, the petition states. 
</P>
<P>
 A third patient drove her car in front of another car and had to be 
hospitalized for head injuries after a distressing session, according to the 
petition. Another suffered "fear and confusion" after Venanzi allegedly pinned 
her to the floor with his body for 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stephen Venanzi is not competent to practice psychotherapy, regardless of the 
type of therapy or the sex of the patient," the petition argues. "He has 
recklessly caused harm to his patients. The flaws in his abilities . . . are 
too basic, going as they do to the heart of how to conduct effective and safe 
psychotherapy."

2 FOUND DEAD AFTER NEIGHBORS CALL POLICE

 The bodies of two elderly people who may have been dead for up to 10 days were 
found Thursday by police who had been asked to check their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers were held at bay by a barking dog for several hours before they could 
enter the house in the 200 block of East Wilson Street, according to Sgt. Matt 
Collett. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not release the names of the residents or the cause of death. 
After discovering the bodies about 9:30 a.m., officers sealed the house until 
investigators could obtain a search warrant, Collett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors identified the residents as an elderly husband and wife who had 
lived in the middle-class area of single-family homes for 25 years. The 
husband, they said, was a retired Marine Corps pilot, and the couple had met 
and married in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The man had recently suffered a stroke and was depressed, neighbors said, and 
was scheduled to visit a medical clinic for tests on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors had called police and asked them to check on the couple.

MOTORISTS AT CHECKPOINT GET LESSON IN CHILD SAFETY; DRIVING: MANY RECEIVE NEW 
CAR SEATS FOR THEIR YOUNGSTERS. THE PROGRAM SEEKS TO INCREASE AWARENESS AND 
PREVENT INJURIES IN ACCIDENTS.

 As Gerry Lang of Sun Valley approached a police checkpoint on Laurel Canyon 
Boulevard on Thursday morning, she quickly snapped on her seat belt. Still, 
when she reached the officer who was peering into cars as they inched their way 
through, he told her to pull over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought for sure I was getting a ticket," she later said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she got a new child car seat. 
</P>
<P>
 And a lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang's 6-month-old son, Davon, was in a safety car seat, but the officer 
noticed that it was old and not properly secured, and that two of three older 
children in the back seat were sharing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "One person, one vote; one seat belt, one person," Stephanie M. Tombrello, 
executive director of SafetyBeltSafe U.S.A., told her. Tombrello's group is a 
national nonprofit organization advocating child passenger safety that helped 
establish the checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next time, don't be so nice and don't give rides to more people than you have 
available seat belts," Tombrello added. "You could get a ticket for that." 
</P>
<P>
 But in exchange for the brief chiding, Lang got a free car seat with a retail 
value of about $70 to replace her old one and had it properly installed in her 
car. So did others who showed up with no seats or faulty ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the day was going to start out bad, but it's been a good day," Lang 
said before driving off. 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoint was set up under a national program called Project Safe Baby, 
which is designed to increase awareness of properly used car seats and make 
them available to low-income families. The program is sponsored by Midas 
Muffler & Brake Shops, which provided the free car seats, and SafetyBeltSafe, 
which provided trained inspectors to check the car seats. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar two-hour checkpoint was set up Tuesday in South-Central Los Angeles, 
and others have been established for short periods in San Francisco, San Diego 
and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Millie Tezanos, the project's executive director, said child safety seat 
awareness is critical because, according to the National Highway Traffic and 
Safety Administration, motor vehicle injuries are the leading cause of death 
and disability for children in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 All 50 states have laws requiring the use of safety seats for young children. 
In California, a child under the age of 4 or weighing less than 40 pounds must 
be secured in an approved child seat. Failure to do so carries a fine of $271. 
</P>
<P>
 Annually, more than 1,700 children are killed and more than 170,000 are 
injured in motor vehicles, but properly used child safety seats reduce the risk 
of death by 71%, hospitalization by 67% and minor injuries by 50%, Tezanos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a product for which you cannot find a substitute," said Tombrello. 
"It makes the difference between life and death." 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoint was originally scheduled to be set up at Van Nuys Boulevard and 
Bradley Avenue near the San Fernando Gardens housing complex. But police moved 
it to Laurel Canyon Boulevard near Ritchie Valens Recreation Center (formerly 
Paxton Park), because the original location was too close to a fire station. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic flow was also better along Laurel Canyon Boulevard, but maybe too 
good, officials said. At times, cars with children riding without safety seats 
were simply given pamphlets and waved through because of a backup of vehicles 
whose drivers were having their new child seats installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tezanos said that more than 50 seats were given away Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased," she said. "We may do this again in December or next 
spring."

GROUNDBREAKING PLANNED FOR MISSION COLLEGE LIBRARY; EDUCATION: THE $11-MILLION 
BUILDING TO OPEN IN 1997 WILL PUT THE CAMPUS ONE STEP CLOSER TO COMPLETION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a long-awaited step toward completion of Mission College, trustees of the 
Los Angeles Community College District have awarded a contract to build an 
$11-million combined library and learning resources building on the Sylmar 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 A groundbreaking for the three-level, 57,000-square-foot project has been 
scheduled in about a month. The complex is expected to be open for the 
college's 5,800 students by the fall of 1997, said Shari Borchetta, an 
assistant to Mission President Jack Fujimoto. 
</P>
<P>
 The small makeshift library the college now uses is housed in the basement of 
another campus building. Mission College, founded in 1975 and the youngest of 
the district's nine campuses, is the only one without its own library building, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's board of trustees voted 7-0 Wednesday night to award the 
$7.8-million construction contract to Lewis Jorge Construction Management Inc. 
of Orange. The remainder of the project's cost consists of planning expenses 
and nearly $2.4 million in equipment and furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will include a 24,425-square-foot library on its second floor, 
about three times the size of the current library space; a 20,575-square-foot 
computer center and tutoring center on the first floor, and a 9,700-square-foot 
basement with a teleconference center and audio-video studio. 
</P>
<P>
 When the project is completed, the number of computer terminals available to 
Mission students will increase from 130 to about 530. And the library, which 
now can display only about half of its 43,000 volumes, will be able to display 
the rest and purchase about 8,000 more, Borchetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will be built along Hubbard Street. Construction funds for the 
complex came from Prop. 153, a $900-million state higher education bond measure 
approved by voters in June 1992. The equipment and furnishing funds will come 
from state revenue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the period between 1975 and 1991, when the college itself operated 
out of various storefronts and other locations, its library was housed in a 
former Kress store building in the city of San Fernando, said Rayma Greenberg, 
chair of the Library Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The original plans submitted to the state in the early 1980s for the Sylmar 
campus, which opened in fall 1991, included a library building, Borchetta said. 
But it was not approved as part of the original construction. Now, the library 
will be the fifth permanent building on the Sylmar campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of cost constraints, the current project is about one-third smaller 
than the library originally envisioned for the campus. However, Borchetta said, 
the complex was designed to permit expansion to the original size if enrollment 
grows and funds are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg, who has run the library since its inception, said she is pleased 
about approval of the project but also worried about the district's financial 
ability to staff and maintain it in the future. "It's exciting on one hand, but 
it's also a concern on the other," she said.

FUND STARTED FOR EL TORO ATHLETES INJURED IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Sixteen-year-old Tomas Mejia remains in a coma one week after he and three 
other El Toro High School cross-country runners were injured in a traffic 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others, Carlos Marchan, 15, who suffered a broken collarbone, and Martin 
Pennell, 17, who had a broken cheekbone, were released from hospitals earlier 
this week.The fourth person, Andy Eads, was treated for a slight concussion but 
not hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Hagin, their coach, said that while classmates, staff and others at the 
school wait hopefully for Mejia to regain consciousness, they have begun a 
fund-raising campaign to help pay the youths' medical bills. Mejia remains 
hospitalized at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. Neither Mejia nor Marchan has 
medical insurance and it is as yet uncertain what portion of their medical 
costs will be covered by the automobile insurance on Pennell's car, which was 
involved in the Aug. 26 crash near the school, Hagin said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, an account was established at National Bank of Southern 
California in Lake Forest to accept contributions for the injured students, 
Hagin said.  
</P>
<P>
 El Toro High School Principal Jack Clement said some proceeds from school 
fund-raisers, including weekly bingo games and a Sept. 30 dance and barbecue, 
as well as part of the school's share of profits from hamburger sales at home 
games, will be deposited in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to contribute, Hagin said, should send checks to the Tomas 
Relief Fund, El Toro High School, 25255 Toledo Way, Lake Forest, CA 92630.

APPEALS COURT REVERSES HOMELESS MAN'S AWARD; LAW: A 1992 JURY HAD RULED FOR 
TRANSIENT WHOSE POSSESSIONS HAD BEEN THROWN OUT BY SANTA ANA EMPLOYEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA and LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court has thrown out a $9,300 award to a homeless man whose 
belongings were discarded by Santa Ana employees, and decided that the city is 
entitled to a new trial that limits the man's potential damage claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by the 4th District Court of Appeal issued Wednesday overturned a 
1992 Orange County Superior Court jury judgment in favor of Marshone Bonner 
that was hailed at the time as a victory for the rights of homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 The large trash bag containing Bonner's possessions, which he said included a 
diamond ring and watch given to him by his estranged wife and photographs of 
his three daughters, was taken by maintenance workers one morning in July, 
1989, during a sweep of the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 While Santa Ana officials were pleased with the ruling, Bonner's lawyer, 
Christopher M. Mears, said it marked a "very dark day for those who are 
victimized by government." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 19-page ruling written by Presiding Justice David G. Sills, the court 
found that the jury had been given improper instructions during the trial. To 
establish that Bonner's constitutional rights were violated, the plaintiff 
would need to prove that the city had a policy of taking property from the 
homeless, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 While that issue was argued at trial, the judge instructed the jury to assume 
that an action taken by a city employee was an official city act. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said he was pleased with the ruling and 
that he is confident no such policy can be proved in a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't see any way that the city in fact had such a policy, because it 
never existed," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 In trial, Bonner's attorney presented a memo written by the city's executive 
director of recreation and community services describing such a policy. But the 
city manager, the mayor and Cooper all testified that Santa Ana had no such 
policy and that the memo was inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate ruling also stated that even if Bonner's attorney proves the 
city had such a policy and violated Bonner's constitutional rights, Bonner 
would not be entitled to emotional damages, but only damages for the loss of 
his possessions, which he estimated at $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing in the actual text of the due process clause of our 
Constitution from which emotional distress damages may be inferred for a 
property deprivation," Sills wrote in the opinion, which was certified for 
publication, meaning it can set legal precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court suggested that Bonner could have pursued other legal 
actions to recover emotional distress damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Mears responded, "Why should society not provide for a full range of damages 
when the most fundamental rights of its citizens are violated."  
</P>
<P>
 Mears said he had not yet been able to pass on information about the ruling to 
Bonner, who is in his late 40s, who remains homeless in the area. He said it 
would be up to Bonner to decide if he wants another trial, which would be the 
third in the case. A first ended in mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who are at greatest risk for having their constitutional rights 
violated by government are almost always, by definition, those people who are 
poor and disadvantaged," he continued. "The Constitution has historically been 
their refuge and the courts have been their guardians. Except today. It's very 
disappointing."

POLITICAL BRIEFING: LEGISLATURE SENDS GOVERNOR THE BILLS AS SESSION COMES TO 
CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Giddiness took over Wednesday night as the state Legislature's 1993-94 session 
rolled toward closure. Several San Fernando Valley-area lawmakers were among 
those who got a little punch drunk in the moments before the curtain fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), often at the forefront of the in crowd, 
flouted the dress code by changing into a personalized black "end of session" 
T-shirt and jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale) told a funny story about getting caught 
scrawling his name inside the Capitol dome at a secret location known only to 
lawmakers leaving their mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) summed up her crusade to rename a 
portion of the Simi Valley Freeway after former President Ronald Reagan as "a 
marvelous experience." 
</P>
<P>
 And people were taking potshots at state Sen. Don Rogers (R-Tehachapi), 
insisting that anything with his name still on it be read especially closely. 
Rogers remained in the Democrats' doghouse for appearing before a suspected 
white supremacist group in Bakersfield last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid the merriment and verbal roughhousing, serious business was getting 
done. In the last week of the session, critical decisions were made on dozens 
of bills introduced by Valley legislators. Here is a sample:  
</P>
<P>
 * A controversial bill to seize the cars of unlicensed drivers won approval 
after it was weakened significantly in response to concerns over civil 
liberties. Dubbed the Safe Streets Act of 1994, the bill is now on the 
governor's desk awaiting signature or veto. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would allow police to confiscate the car of an unlicensed driver 
who has a prior conviction for driving without a valid license. A previous 
version of the measure would have allowed seizure of autos belonging to 
first-time offenders. Once confiscated the car would be sold, with proceeds 
going to pay off the car loan, the tow-truck company and the impound lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, says the bill's author, Katz, is to remove dangerous drivers from 
the road. According to the state Department of Motor Vehicles, 2 million of 
California's 20 million motorists slide behind the wheel illegally. A study 
shows they were responsible for about 12% of motor vehicle fatalities last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earthquake victims recalling the headache of overpaying for goods and 
services after the Northridge temblor will want to watch for the outcome of a 
price-gouging bill passed by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson must now decide whether to sign this bill, which would extend 
protection to unincorporated areas not covered by an existing Los Angeles law. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially the Wilson Administration opposed this Katz measure because it would 
allow prices to be increased by only 10% instead of the 50% the Administration 
thought fair in the wake of a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 But the governor's Department of Consumer Affairs quickly reversed field and 
removed its objections after an outcry from consumer rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would make it a misdemeanor to raise prices by more than 10% 
following a declared state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quake victims no doubt will also be interested in what happens to a bill by 
Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) to prevent insurance companies from 
bailing out on their customers after a major temblor or firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Passed by the Legislature and now on Wilson's desk, the bill would authorize 
the governor, during a state of emergency, to block insurance companies from 
canceling or refusing to renew policies. The exceptions are when a customer 
falls behind on payments or commits fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the bill, the order would remain in effect for one year. The measure 
"would prevent people who have been pummeled by a natural disaster from being 
slammed again when their insurance is canceled," Margolin said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Not one, not two, but three bills are on the governor's desk to clean up a 
messy problem created by Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich has the distinction of inspiring three different lawmakers to write 
bills to plug loopholes that forced the county to pay a $1.2-million civil 
judgment on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), Assemblyman Paul Horcher 
(R-Diamond Bar) and Katz all secured passage of proposals limiting the 
liability of local governments when elected officials misbehave. 
</P>
<P>
 Each measure has a slightly different focus, but all would restrict the use of 
taxpayer funds to defend a lawsuit or pay a judgment against an elected 
official who is guilty of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for such legislation arose after Los Angeles County taxpayers picked 
up the $1.2-million tab for Antonovich when a court found him liable last year 
for conspiring to influence a judge on behalf of a campaign contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich had telephoned a judge five years ago to put in a good word for 
campaign donor Krikor Suri and his jewelry business partners, embroiled in a 
lawsuit with another partner. Campaign reports disclose that Suri and his 
companies contributed $19,000 to Antonovich's campaign from 1985 until 1989, 
loaned him $10,000 about a month before he phoned the judge and made a $3,000 
contribution four days after the call was made. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fast-moving firestorms such as the ones that swept through Topanga Canyon 
and Calabasas last year sparked a bill by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood) to add new firefighting equipment to the state's arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, passed and sent to the governor's desk, authorizes a trial lease 
of two "superscooper" firefighting planes capable of dipping down into the 
ocean to scoop up 1,600 gallons of water to drop on blazes. 
</P>
<P>
 The exotic aircraft are used in Canada, France and Spain in terrain similar to 
Southern California. The cities of Agoura Hills, Calabasas and Westlake Village 
support the measure, which is similar to one authored by Friedman two years ago 
but vetoed by Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Valley-area library backers are joining others in flooding the governor's 
office with cards and letters in support of a bill by state Sen. David A. 
Roberti (D-Van Nuys) to create a new funding mechanism for libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would let voters decide whether the county should set up a so-called 
benefit assessment district to help fund Los Angeles County branches. Under 
such a district, property owners would be billed about $25 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Although similar to a move county supervisors took this week to create a 
community facilities district and bill property owners $28.50 each, Roberti's 
proposal has one key difference -- it requires local voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson vetoed a similar bill last year, but must consider his more politically 
vulnerable position this year. Library users who want to see the bill signed 
into law are aware the governor is running for reelection, and they hope to 
remind him they are one group that tends to turn out on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of other bills went down to defeat, including Roberti's measure to 
broaden California's assault weapons ban to include so-called "copycat" 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a last hurrah for a veteran state senator whose earlier weapons ban so 
angered gun-rights advocates that they launched an unsuccessful attempt to 
recall Roberti last April. But Roberti has to give up his seat due to term 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Another eleventh-hour effort that fell short of its goal would have provided 
additional funding to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy for purchase of 
public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) reportedly scotched a scheme 
by Katz to get funds for the conservancy by tucking $17.5 million into a 
$375-million infrastructure and park bonds bill by Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The sum included $5 million tentatively earmarked for buying land in the Big 
Tujunga Wash, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lockyer dashed hopes for passage of any bond measures, and Brown's 
bill died in the Senate on Wednesday night after sailing through the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy Executive Director Joe Edmiston, who admitted to "trolling the 
hallways" of the Capitol in search of allies, said it was a coup to have that 
much money slipped into an existing bonds bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But even $17.5 million would not have reversed the cash drought the 
conservancy has suffered of late because of cutbacks in state and federal 
allocations. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're dying of thirst in the desert, you don't need a lake, you need a 
spring," Edmiston said. "Unfortunately, I think we were crawling toward a 
mirage."

GOOD WEATHER ON HORIZON FOR HOLIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Labor Day Weekend in Orange County looks like "classic, Southern California 
weather, with no big storm systems," according to meteorologist Dean Jones of 
WeatherData, which provides forecasts to The Times.

 Coastal areas can expect partly cloudy skies overnight and in the early 
morning hours, turning to mostly sunny afternoons.Inland areas should be mostly 
sunny throughout the day, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures are expected to warm by a degree each day through the weekend. At 
the coast, temperatures should be in the upper 60s and 70s. Inland highs are 
expected to be in the 80s. Early in the weekend, humidity could reach the upper 
90s early in the day, Jones said, dropping into the 40s and 50s by the 
afternoon. There should be no winds to speak of, according to WeatherData, and 
no major weather systems to disrupt the sunshine.

COURT UPHOLDS HOME MORTGAGE BIAS DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court has upheld a $150,000 award to a black couple who sued a 
South Orange County mortgage broker, alleging they were denied a home loan in 
tony Coto de Caza because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous opinion released Thursday, the 4th District Court of Appeal 
ruled there was ample evidence to support the jury's conclusion that George and 
Elizabeth Green were discriminated against by the Rancho Santa Margarita 
Mortgage Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury's verdict does not reflect merely the outcome of an artificial game 
of legal hot potato, but the valid and unrebutted possibility of race 
discrimination," Justice David G. Sills wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's attorney, Walter Greene Jr., said the ruling "ends a long and 
painful ordeal for these very decent people."  
</P>
<P>
 The Greens sued in 1989 after they were turned down for a loan while trying to 
buy a $440,000 house in Coto de Caza. At the time, the Greens, who are both 
registered nurses, were living in Compton and earning more than $16,000 a 
month. Their attorney said the couple was more qualified than some white 
families who bought homes in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very concerned about safety, and they wanted to move to Coto de 
Caza," Greene said. "They worked 70 hours a week so they could get their dream 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 During trial, attorneys for the mortgage company said the couple was denied a 
loan because of a poor credit history, not because of race. The company 
appealed, contending there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's 
findings. The company's attorneys could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Since filing their lawsuit, the Greens have bought a more expensive home in 
the same Coto de Caza neighborhood. Greene said his clients have opened their 
own medical clinic in South Central Los Angeles and are pleased with the 
appellate court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to see the system work as well as it did in this case," Greene 
said. "There's no question that the right party won. There was never any doubt 
in their minds that they were discriminated against." 
</P>
<P>
 Interest and attorney's fees could bring the award up to about $300,000, 
Greene said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ROLLER COASTER REOPENS AS ACCIDENTS BLAMED ON 
HUMAN ERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Cyclone Coaster at the Antelope Valley Fair, which was temporarily closed 
after two accidents on the ride injured nine people, has been reopened, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 State Industrial Relations Department officials said they rescinded the permit 
for the Cyclone Coaster for two days until it was determined that both 
accidents were caused by operator error and not a mechanical defect, said 
department spokesman John Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the injuries was serious and the ride was allowed to reopen Wednesday 
evening, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the state fire marshal canceled a fireworks show at the fair 
after nearby residents reported seeing flaming material land on their homes 
nearby, according to fair director Bruce Latta. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had fallout into some neighborhoods that we shouldn't have, so the fire 
marshal pulled their permit," Latta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair organizers originally planned a five-minute fireworks show every night at 
11 p.m., but shows on Saturday and Monday nights started an hour late because 
of technical difficulties. The contractor, Zambelli Internationale Fireworks, 
was cited for failure to follow the terms of its state fireworks permit, Latta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Latta said the roller coaster was back in business after state inspectors, who 
issue permits for all carnival rides operated in California, gave their 
approval. "So far, we haven't had any more problems with it," Latta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accidents on the roller coaster, which takes six people to operate, 
occurred when cars failed to stop at the end of the ride and slammed into cars 
waiting at the loading platform, Latta said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the responsibility of one person to reset the brake system each time the 
ride runs, which was not done, Latta said. "Apparently, (one operator) must 
have forgotten to reset it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The operator who was on duty during those accidents has been transferred, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, four girls were injured when a car on the roller coaster made its 
final turn and raced into the loading area, slamming into an empty car that hit 
another car ahead of it filled with passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls complained of pain in their stomachs after the restraining bar in 
the car hit them. They were not seriously injured, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday night, five people were injured when an empty car rear-ended a car 
filled with passengers at the loading platform. A third car barreled into the 
loading area and hit the empty car in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the five injured passengers were taken to the hospital, where they 
were treated and released that night.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE LOOKS TO EXPAND BOUNDARIES IN BID TO 
ATTRACT COLLEGE; DEVELOPMENT: COUNCIL MEMBERS INITIATE THE PROCESS TO ADD A 
900-ACRE SITE, BUT THE PLAN IS DRAWING CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has voted unanimously to begin the process of expanding 
Palmdale's boundaries to include a 900-acre site where a new community college 
campus may be built. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plan triggered mixed reactions at Wednesday night's meeting from 
residents who said they fear the college will bring traffic problems and 
high-density urban development to their rural area southeast of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents' concerns stemmed from a developer's offer to donate 100 acres in 
the annexation area for the college campus if the city approves his plan to 
build a golf course, retail center and about 1,000 homes near the college. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they are eager to see construction of an Antelope Valley 
College branch campus in Palmdale. But they also vowed to move cautiously on 
overall development in the proposed annexation area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is only an initiating action," Mayor Jim Ledford said. "The review of 
that project is yet to come." 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted only to submit an application to the Los Angeles County 
Local Agency Formation Commission, which reviews city boundaries changes. The 
application will cover 900 acres of unincorporated land south of Pearblossom 
Highway and west of 47th Street East. 
</P>
<P>
 The annexation was requested by businessman David P. Bushnell, founder of the 
binoculars company that bears his name. Bushnell owns 540 acres in the proposed 
annexation area. The remaining 360 acres were included to connect Bushnell's 
property to the current city border. 
</P>
<P>
 Bushnell has offered to donate 100 acres for a college if the city annexes his 
property and approves his development plan for the land adjacent to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The annexation hinges first on a property tax transfer agreement, which must 
be approved by the Palmdale City Council and the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors. Then, the agency formation commission's seven-member board, which 
includes two county supervisors, will conduct a hearing and vote on moving the 
land from the county into Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission's board approves the plan, the City Council will conduct 
another hearing, during which 25% of the annexation area's property owners or 
registered voters could object and force an election on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale officials said no one living in the annexation area has filed a 
written objection. But at Thursday's meeting, several people who live nearby 
said they were worried that city officials will destroy the rural character of 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're just going to ride roughshod over the people who live in that area 
just because you want a college," resident John Maurer told the council. "It's 
going to bring traffic like you wouldn't believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members responded that an environmental impact review of Bushnell's 
project still must be done, and that the development plan, including the number 
of houses that can be built, still must be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a done deal," Mayor Ledford said. "I think we need to keep that 
in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Myers said he favors the annexation because he does not want 
"to do anything to hamper our ability to get a college there." But Myers also 
said he wants development near the college to be "something that is very much 
in harmony with what's going on in that area now."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CALARTS GETS $21.1 MILLION FOR REPAIRS; QUAKE: 
THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY CHECK MEANS SURVIVAL, OFFICIALS SAY. 
ALL CLASSES HAVE BEEN HELD OFF CAMPUS SINCE THE TEMBLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 CalArts officials accepted a $21.1-million check from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency on Thursday, saying it means the financial survival of the 
highly renowned arts college. 
</P>
<P>
 The 60-acre campus was rocked by the Northridge earthquake as it began the 
first week of its spring semester.Classes resumed two weeks later -- in 16 
locations improvised as satellite classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know of no other educational institution that has had to quickly and 
completely operate off campus," CalArts trustee Lawrence Ramer said during the 
check presentation ceremony. "If it hadn't been for the FEMA support, CalArts 
would not exist today." 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA Director James Lee Witt and Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Thursday toured 
CalArts' main building, the 500,000-square-foot structure that includes art 
galleries, music studios, rehearsal rooms, theaters, administrative offices and 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus will mark its 25th year when classes begin Sept. 12, but the school 
might not have seen that anniversary if FEMA had not come through with the 
funding so quickly, Ramer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the finest example of the community, government and corporate world 
working together," Ramer said. "The very financial survival of CalArts was at 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The private college suffered an estimated $20 million in damage from the Jan. 
17 earthquake, not including the cost to relocate classes. It has qualified for 
nearly $25 million in earthquake recovery funds altogether, with 90% paid by 
FEMA and the remainder provided by the Governor's Office of Emergency Services, 
according to FEMA spokesman Russ Edmonston. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt said FEMA has simply carried through on President Clinton's promise that 
it would assist with earthquake recovery efforts for as long as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be here until it is finished," Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
 New student orientation for the fall semester is scheduled Tuesday on the 
campus.

O.C. PLATFORM; PUT TEAM OWNERS ON LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan B. Webb of Orange, commenting on the L.A. Rams possibly leaving 
Orange County and the inducements being considered to make them stay, thinks 
owners have the responsibility to produce a good team. He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Players get to the pros by virtue of skill and hard work. They put their 
bodies on the line each time they step on the field.They get paid accordingly. 
If they don't perform they are soon gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Team owners get to own teams by virtue of birth or marriage as often as 
anything else. If they make poor decisions and produce a bad product they have 
another option. They threaten to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Next thing you know taxpayers are burdened with a huge new debt, and some 
owner who has demonstrated only that he or she is a poor manager has a new 
fortune and new stadium to entertain their friends in for a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 This process of municipal extortion is a time-honored tradition in the 
National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 Producing a quality product is a management decision. A poor product is not 
the fault of the employees or the showroom where it is sold. Team owners are 
saved time and again through taxpayer largess and vast TV revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe if we'd let owners sink or swim on their own merits we'd see a vast 
improvement in their performance.

SUCCESS AT DIVISION I LEVEL GIVES EASTERBROOK THE EDGE; TITANS: UNIVERSITY 
PRESIDENT HOPES HIRING OF NEW ATHLETIC DIRECTOR SENDS A 'STRONG MESSAGE' TO THE 
DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton President Milton Gordon said he was doing more than naming 
an athletic director Thursday when he introduced John Easterbrook as Bill 
Shumard's successor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't just a hiring, it's a message," Gordon said. "I'm sending a strong 
message to the athletic department that the athletic program is an integral 
part of our overall university program." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said he made the final decision on Easterbrook, who for the last nine 
years has been senior associate athletic director at Fresno State. Easterbrook, 
55, was one of three finalists whose names were submitted without ranking to 
Gordon by a 12-member search committee. The others were Judith Davidson, 
athletic director at Central Connecticut State, and Jack Mehl, business manager 
of the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We interviewed some really good candidates, and they were all qualified for 
the job," Gordon said. "But over the weekend, I made a number of calls on my 
own, and I came to the conclusion that one person stood out because of his 
experience with a successful Division I program, and for his own personal 
experiences in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a strong budget background from his work as president and vice 
president of banks, and we all know how important budgets are these days. After 
careful consideration, it was clear to me that he was the best candidate for 
Cal State Fullerton. . . . He knows what's necessary, and he can work in the 
community and the university. I feel great about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook said he has been "excited and enthusiastic" about Fullerton's 
sports potential since he first visited the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about being here because the people are all winners," Easterbrook 
said. "In my mind, all the positives outweigh any negatives that might exist. 
There are some outstanding coaches already in place here, and the 
student-athlete base in this area is tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook was a banker in Laramie, Wyo., for 12 years before he decided to 
return to athletics. He was hired at Fresno State by Athletic Director Gary 
Cunningham, the former UCLA basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Easterbrook coached football for 13 years, either as an assistant 
or offensive coordinator at Idaho, Oregon State, Illinois and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook was known as an overachiever as a college athlete. He was a 
three-year starter at quarterback for Illinois in his hometown of Champaign, 
playing in the Big Ten at 5 feet 9 and 150 pounds in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook said he plans to start his new job "as soon as I can get here," 
although no definite date has been set. Steve Murray has been interim director 
since Shumard left the position at the end of May. Shumard later became an 
assistant athletic director at Long Beach State, his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 When he does begin work, Easterbrook said his first order of business will be 
to consult with coaches and other staff members. "I want to hear from people 
and get their ideas about things, " he said. "I believe in treating this as a 
family situation. If everyone is rowing the boat in the same direction, things 
always go better." 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook left no doubt in his meeting with coaches and staff members 
earlier in the day that he wants and expects a competitive, winning program. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm going to sell people on coming here and helping us, we're going to 
have to have a winning program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook said he thinks the school's athletic facilities in general are 
good, although "there are still some things we want to do." He declined to be 
specific, until he has more opportunity to study the situation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon mentioned that a plan still exists to remodel the gymnasium, but that 
project still has not been funded by the state. Gordon also noted that this 
will be the first year in which the athletic program will benefit from a 
student fee referendum. That will amount to "a net of about $500,000," Gordon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham, who hired Easterbrook as his top assistant at Fresno State, said 
Easterbrook's budget and banking background especially was helpful. But equally 
important is that he works well with others, Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'll do very well at Fullerton," Cunningham said by telephone from 
Fresno. "He understands coaches because he's been a coach himself, as well as 
an athlete. And he really cares about the athletes. John has good values." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham said he gave Easterbrook a wide range of responsibilities, and he 
handled them all well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will definitely be missed here, but I'm happy for him because I know that 
being an athletic director is something he's been wanting to do," Cunningham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball Coach Augie Garrido, who was a member of the search committee, said 
he was especially encouraged by Gordon's enthusiasm about the choice. "The fact 
that the president is so excited about John is really good," Garrido said. "I 
think he's very capable. This all takes teamwork, and I think he's a team 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 The other coach on the search committee, women's basketball Coach Debbie 
Ayres, said Easterbrook's background in the Cal State university system should 
enable him to adjust more quickly than someone from outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked to several people at Fresno, and they had nothing but good things 
to say about him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Softball Coach Judi Garman said she thinks Fullerton should benefit from 
Easterbrook's experience at Fresno State, which has had one of the most 
successful athletic programs in the system. Fresno State won or shared five 
Western Athletic Conference championships this past year and finished second in 
four other sports. The Bulldogs were second in the WAC all-sports standings in 
their third year in the conference after leaving the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can do half of what Fresno State has done, that will be great," Garman 
said.

KARIYA GETS A BIG CHUNK OF MAGIC KINGDOM; HOCKEY: MIGHTY DUCKS' TOP PICK OF 
1993 SIGNS THREE-YEAR CONTRACT WORTH $6.5 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fourteen months after drafting the player they'd like to build their franchise 
around, the Mighty Ducks finally have Paul Kariya's autograph after signing him 
to a three-year, $6.5-million contract late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which pays $4.775 million in signing bonuses and a $575,000 annual 
salary, ends a saga so drawn-out and complicated that General Manager Jack 
Ferreira said weeks ago that when -- and if -- Kariya signed the newspaper 
headline should simply be: "Finally." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya was relieved, too, after completing a few details so he could sign 
Wednesday night. That avoided the uncertainties of a new standard NHL contract 
that went into effect Thursday -- and perhaps the threat of a rookie salary cap 
that could result from ongoing collective-bargaining talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel ecstatic," said Kariya, 19, a former University of Maine player who 
starred for Canada in the Olympics and World Championships. "I'm really 
excited. At the same time I'm relieved the negotiating process is over and I 
finally get to play hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the Ducks made Kariya a very rich rookie by NHL standards, giving 
the fourth overall pick from the 1993 NHL draft a contract that will pay him an 
average of $2.166 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 That's more than second overall 1993 pick Chris Pronger, whose four-year, 
$7-million deal with Hartford is worth an average of $1.75 million a year. And 
it's more than the Ducks' second overall pick this year, defenseman Oleg 
Tverdovsky, made when he signed a three-year, $4.2-million contract paying an 
average of $1.4 million a year on Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it's more than the Ducks implied they'd ever pay an unproven rookie, 
calling the contracts of Pronger and Ottawa's Alexandre Daigle last year 
"aberrations." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they signed Kariya to a contract equal to the deal signed by Peter 
Forsberg of Quebec, a former holdout who could be Kariya's main rival for the 
Calder Trophy as rookie of the year this season. In fact, if Daigle's 
five-year, $12.25-million contract ($2.45 million a year) is converted from 
Canadian to U.S. dollars, Kariya will actually average more, though his 
contract's total value is dwarfed by Daigle's. 
</P>
<P>
 The signing caps a summer spending spree for the Ducks, who had the NHL's 
lowest payroll last season at $7.8 million but have spent nearly $13.5 million 
on draft picks this summer. In addition to Tverdovsky, they signed last year's 
second- and third-round picks, Nikolai Tsulygin and Valeri Karpov. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we proved we're serious about improving our team," Ferreira said. The 
Ducks won 33 games during their first season, sharing an NHL record number with 
Florida, but the team had the worst power play in the NHL and struggled 
offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira said Kariya's performance since the '93 draft -- at the time he was 
considered a skilled and imaginative playmaker who might be too small for the 
NHL -- justified the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has proved himself over and above anyone else in that draft," Ferreira 
said. "Paul has really taken himself to a different level. He went to the 
Olympics and the World Championships, and at the World Championships he was 
playing among all those NHL players. He was (Canada's) leading scorer and one 
of the outstanding players of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we've gotten the two best players in the last two drafts. We got both 
of the players we rated No. 1. We rated Kariya No. 1 and we rated Tverdovsky 
No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kariya negotiations didn't start until after the Olympics, when the Ducks 
made an initial offer worth less than $1 million a year. They stalled this 
summer when agent Don Baizley began contending that if Kariya didn't reach 
terms with the Ducks this year, he should become an unrestricted free agent 
next June. The reason: Under NHL rules, Kariya would be too old to return to 
the draft as most unsigned players do. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks were concerned that he had a point -- and Ferreira admits "at times 
we questioned whether he really wanted to play here or not."  
</P>
<P>
 The stalemate didn't break until the Ducks met with Kariya and Baizley last 
week, then upped their original offer by more than a million and told them it 
would be their last proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers eliminated the free-agency issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya insists he was never "anti-Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been in the back of my mind that I'd eventually be a Mighty 
Duck," he said. "In the back of my mind, Anaheim was the only one I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly had the ink dried on the contract before the Ducks began to try to 
control expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not expecting him to come in and carry us immediately," Ferreira said. 
"Eventually, though, he probably will be a cornerstone of this franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 Said club president Tony Tavares: "We respect Paul, but he's a piece of a 
puzzle as opposed to the entire puzzle. I don't want people getting their 
expectation level to where they expect a 19-year-old guy to score 50 goals and 
have 70 assists. He still has to make the adjustment." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson is delighted to add Kariya to a team whose offense last year 
was best described as ugly duckling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't have the ability to do a lot of things creative offensively 
last year," he said. "Now we've got people with the creativity and imagination 
to create things, and we need to finish off the chances they create. I wasn't 
disappointed in our shots on goal, just our ability to finish them off." 
</P>
<P>
 He envisions Kariya, a winger in the NHL, playing with center Anatoli Semenov, 
another skillful playmaker, with either another skilled player such as Garry 
Valk or Valeri Karpov on the wing or a tough guy such as Todd Ewen or Stu 
Grimson. 
</P>
<P>
 Will those players accept a teen-ager who makes more than they do? Kariya at 
least has a foot in the door after rooming with defenseman Bobby Dollas at the 
World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty skeptical when I went there," Dollas said. "I said, 'Let's see 
what this kid's all about.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And he quickly did. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sees a lot of things on the ice other people don't see," Dollas said. "He 
sees gaps and openings. He was one of our best players, and that's kind of 
good, considering he was the lowest-paid player on (the Canadian) team -- at 
that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Dollas was himself a first-round pick in 1983, when Winnipeg drafted him 14th 
overall. He made about $130,000 that year, but he thinks Kariya's personality 
will help him get along. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do expect him to take us out to dinner," Dollas said.

MIKE PENNER: KARIYA GETS A BIG CHUNK OF MAGIC KINGDOM; V-DAY PARADE DOWN 
STREETS OF ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The assembled reporters had to sit down for this one. In the back of the room, 
ice and powerful jolts of piping hot caffeine were available. Smelling salts 
and cold compresses, if necessary, could be found in the trainer's room down 
the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "MIGHTY DUCKS OF ANAHEIM" blurted the boldface type on the press release, 
"SIGN 1993 TOP DRAFT CHOICE PAUL KARIYA TO MULTI-YEAR CONTRACT." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, the streets of Anaheim were filled with sailors kissing nurses, grown 
men weeping, children singing, total strangers hugging and bombs bursting in 
midair. 
</P>
<P>
 Or if not, they should have been. 
</P>
<P>
 This was peace in our time, armistice at last, the dawning of a bright new 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 14 long, cold, hard months -- 431 days if you're counting, and 
most Mighty Duck fans were -- the Kariyan Conflict has come to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kariya, the most mightily reluctant Duck, has come to terms and will be 
on the ice, in uniform, for the opening session of training camp Monday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 First, though, will be Sunday's media day, where writers and photographers 
will be allowed to touch and pinch Kariya and shake his hand, to gather 
physical evidence for their eyewitness reports. If it's a hologram or some 
other figment of the Disney animation department's imagination, you'll be the 
first to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing is everything, of course, and we probably should have been tipped off 
the other day when Disneyland pulled the plug on the Pigskin Classic, freeing 
up a few extra million dollars to throw Kariya's way. Let's see: Ohio State vs. 
Fresno State in August . . . or a serious run at the 1995 Stanley Cup playoffs? 
If I'm Michael Eisner, I make the same choice in a second. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's jubilant press conference, Ducks Coach Ron Wilson was beside 
himself, as were several media types who wanted to know what Wilson planned to 
do with Kariya. This is a little like Ed McMahon asking what you plan to do 
with the $14 million he has just handed you. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, I already know who I'm gonna put him with," said Wilson, eyes 
glistening. "We'll play Paul either on the right wing or left wing with Tony 
Semenov at center. At the other wing, we might go with skill person, like 
(Valeri) Karpov, or a grinder like Garry Valk. Or maybe a physical guy, like 
Todd Ewen or Stu Grimson." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been playing around with different lines for a month." 
</P>
<P>
 And the thinking behind a Semenov-Kariya pairing, other than the notion of 
breaking them in together, seeing as how neither player has appeared in many 
games for the Ducks to this point? 
</P>
<P>
 "To draw an analogy," Wilson said, "I sort of liken it to mathematicians. When 
it comes to understanding geometry at the highest level, Tony is right up there 
with Paul. Rather than having some guy just adding numbers, these guys 
understand all the angles. They speak the same language . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to passing the puck, Paul is almost in the same league with 
Wayne Gretzky and right there with Adam Oates and Craig Janney. Paul should 
play with someone who's a threat, and Tony, when he wasn't hurt last year, was 
our best offensive threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson took his first extended look at Kariya during the World Championships 
in Italy last June, pining behind Team USA's bench as he watched Kariya whisk 
Canada to the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time I'd seen him play before was in a college game," Wilson said. 
"Here, he was playing with and against some of the best players in the NHL and 
he was (Wilson begins to chuckle with delight) controlling the game. He made 
something happen every time he stepped on the ice." 
</P>
<P>
 When both the American and Canadian teams were practicing in Milan, Wilson 
made a point to seek out Kariya and talk with him every day. It was the basic 
scouting process turned upside down: First the Ducks draft Kariya, then, 12 
months later, Wilson attempts to recruit him. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Wilson also served as host and tour guide for Kariya during a quick 
look-see of Orange County. Wilson played it to the hilt, pulling the roof down 
on the family car -- "I wanted to let the wind blow through his hair" -- and 
driving Kariya around to "some of the hot spots." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Bay? Laguna Beach? 
</P>
<P>
 "In-And-Out Burgers," Wilson said triumphantly. Know your customer is still 
Rule 1 for any salesman -- and Kariya remains a teen-ager, at least for the 
next month-and-a-half. 
</P>
<P>
 Via the drive-thru window in Anaheim and dasher boards in Milan, Wilson and 
Kariya began to bond. "He keeps calling me, 'Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson,' so I 
started calling him 'Dennis,' " Wilson said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, they discovered they shared more common ground that either could 
have possibly imagined. Both have ties to Vancouver -- Kariya grew up there, 
Wilson used to coach there -- but more than that, they have ties to the same 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to live only three blocks away," Wilson said. "I had no idea until I 
went up there to meet Paul and his family. I recognized his father right away. 
He officiated some of my daughter's high school basketball games. I'd see him 
around from time to time." 
</P>
<P>
 Uh-oh. So there lies the problem. Basketball Father Wilson once aired out 
Referee Kariya after a questionable charging call . . . and the Kariya family 
has this very long memory, see . . . and when it came time to negotiate a 
contract . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no!" Wilson said, waving his hands in mock horror. "I never yelled 
during games. I wasn't one of those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 No, Wilson is one of those guys who, in the middle of a group interview about 
his new star winger, yells across the room so Ducks General Manager Jack 
Ferreira can hear: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking Jack to Maui for dinner!" 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, roasted Duck can be taken off the menu.

PRO FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; THE BEAT GOES ON FOR RECEIVER BROWN; 
RAIDERS: HEFTY NEW CONTRACT FOR THE WOULD-BE DRUMMER CONTAINS SOME CATCHY 
NUMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim Brown became one of the NFL's highest-paid players last March when the 
Raiders matched a four-year, $11-million contract he had conditionally signed 
with the Denver Broncos less than a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 With a $2.4-million signing bonus and a guaranteed $3 million for the fourth 
year, this seemed to be the best deal of Brown's life. Which would have been 
true for most, but not for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important agreement in Brown's life occurred 15 years ago when he was 
a 5-foot-4, 135-pound freshman at Woodrow Wilson High in Dallas. It was reached 
with his father, Eugene, who secretly signed a paper that allowed Tim to play 
on the freshman football team instead of becoming a drummer in the band, as his 
mother, Josephine, 
</P>
<P>
 wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just wanted to play and he kept asking me until we worked out a deal," 
Eugene Brown said. "His mother had him in the band and she just didn't agree 
with him playing football." 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two months, the arrangement was kept secret from Josephine until 
the bandleader started calling to ask about Tim's frequent absences, and she 
noticed her son's name in a local newspaper's sports section. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was really upset when she found out," Eugene said. "She was mad at both 
of us for weeks. I signed the slip only because Timmy kept bugging me to do 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 Little did the Browns know at the time that their son later would become the 
NFL's best wide receiver/punt returner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years, I've told that story quite a few times, but it always makes 
me laugh," said Josephine Brown, a devout Pentecostal churchgoer who objects to 
competition. "In fact, just the other day, I talked to Tim on the phone and 
told him that his little sister did the same thing to get out of band to play 
basketball at her school." 
</P>
<P>
 Josephine might laugh now, but at the time she was seriously concerned about 
her son's welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, she watched Tim tag along with his older brother, Donald Kelly, and 
try to play with the bigger kids. But because of his size, he often seemed to 
be on the verge of getting injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was like any other little brother who would pester me all the time," said 
Kelly, who is eight years older than Tim. "I would take him outside and teach 
him how to catch. I would throw the football as hard as I could from about 10 
yards or so and make him catch it with his hands. I would always yell at him 
because I thought the ball was hitting his body, but he really was catching it 
with his hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Brown may have been short, but he had heart and desire. These qualities, 
gained from his close-knit family, have helped throughout a career that has 
followed a pattern of bouncing back from adversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I learned early that when good things happen, you better be ready for 
something bad," said Brown, who was a Pro Bowl starter last season after 
finishing with 80 catches and an AFC-best 1,180 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown went on to compete not only in football at Woodrow Wilson but also in 
basketball and track. And in addition to his drumming in the band, he was vice 
president of the senior class and sports editor of the school's newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't think Tim would reach that high in sports because he was so 
small," said Eugene, who worked as a cement mason for more than 20 years. "But 
he always had the will." 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, Brown was good enough to catch the eyes of recruiters and 
decided to attend Notre Dame over Southern Methodist and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman at Notre Dame, Brown's toughness was called upon again after he 
fumbled his first kickoff against Purdue, in front of 60,672 fans. Then, to 
make matters worse, Brown found himself playing a halfback role in a running 
offense under Gerry Faust. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of packing it in and returning to Dallas, Brown remained at South 
Bend, Ind., and his career was given new life the next year when Lou Holtz 
became coach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next three seasons, Brown prospered with the Irish, winning the Heisman 
Trophy as a senior, and was selected by the Raiders in the first round of the 
1988 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown arrived in Los Angeles with great expectations and lived up to them in 
his first season. As a rookie, he was named to the Pro Bowl after catching 43 
passes for 725 yards and accounting for 2,316 all-purpose yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1989, Brown's season ended in the first game of the regular season 
when he suffered a knee injury, which also hampered him the next year as he 
struggled to make 18 catches for 265 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown bounced back with a solid season in 1991 and gained his second Pro 
Bowl berth after leading the AFC in punt returns with an average of 11.4 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his success, there was still a question of whether he could become one 
of the NFL's top receivers.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the coaches always knew that I could play," Brown said. "It was 
just I wasn't being used as an every-down player. I only needed a more defined 
role." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Brown finally got his chance to become a full-time starter, and he 
responded by leading the team in catches, receiving yardage and touchdowns. But 
that was only a hint of what was to come with the arrival of quarterback Jeff 
Hostetler as a free agent from the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing with Timmy was that he had been unlucky when it came to playing 
with a real good quarterback," Eugene said. "Once Hostetler came, that's all 
Timmy talks about -- playing with him. Timmy believes in Hostetler 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 The way Brown and Hostetler started together last season in the Raiders' 24-7 
victory over the Minnesota Vikings, one would have thought they had worked 
together throughout the off-season. But it was simply good chemistry that 
finally produced success, Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Jeff was an accurate passer and that's important to me," Brown said. 
"Before the first game, however, we really didn't click because we hadn't 
worked with each other much. But it didn't take long after that to see that he 
was what we needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown caught a career-high nine passes against the Seattle Seahawks the next 
week, before the Raiders inexplicably stopped calling his number. In the next 
two games, Brown hardly saw the ball as the Raiders lost to the Cleveland 
Browns and Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the bond between Hostetler and Brown strengthened.  
</P>
<P>
 At a practice before the Raiders played the New York Jets, Hostetler told the 
team that to get back on the winning track, they needed to get the ball to 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once he said that, it was like lighting a fire under (me)," Brown said. "I 
took that like a challenge, and that was the turning point of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown resumed burning secondaries from coast to coast. He caught 10 passes for 
183 yards against the Buffalo Bills on Dec. 5, then made 11 catches for 173 
yards against the Denver Broncos to close the regular season on Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown wound up having four games with 100 or more receiving yards and became 
the Raiders' all-time punt return leader as he finished third in the AFC with 
an 11.6-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
 After the season ended with a second-round playoff loss at Buffalo, the 
Raiders named Brown as a transition player, meaning he was allowed to shop 
himself to other teams with the possibility of the Raiders matching any 
proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two months, Brown did not know where the Raiders stood as he 
fielded offers from nearly every team in the NFL that wanted to upgrade its 
passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best and the worst all at the same time," Brown said about signing 
with Denver and waiting for the Raiders to match. "You knew that it was good 
for you financially, but having to wait to know if the Raiders wanted you was 
tough. After a while, it was unnerving." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown didn't know that the Raiders were going to match Denver's contract until 
a reporter called him one day before the deadline -- a call that caught him by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, I really didn't feel like they were going to match," Brown 
said. "I really felt that way because only a day before, the Raiders signed 
(defensive back) Albert Lewis." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with Hostetler in his second year and fellow receivers Alexander Wright, 
James Jett, Rocket Ismail and Daryl Hobbs providing increased support, Brown 
feels like an elder statesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been defined whether I will catch 50 balls, 75 or 100," Brown said. 
"I don't know yet. But I do know that my role is to help the team win a 
championship, and I will do whatever it takes."

KARIYA GETS BIG PAYDAY FROM DUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fourteen months after drafting the player they wanted to build their franchise 
around, the Mighty Ducks finally signed Paul Kariya to a three-year, 
$6.5-million contract Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which pays $4.775 million in signing bonuses and a $575,000 annual 
salary, ends a saga so drawn out and complicated that General Manager Jack 
Ferreira said weeks ago that when and if Kariya signed, the newspaper headline 
should simply be, "Finally." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya was relieved, too, after quickly agreeing to a few details so that he 
could avoid the uncertainties of a new standard NHL contract that went into 
effect Thursday -- and perhaps the threat of a rookie salary cap that might 
emerge from ongoing collective bargaining talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel ecstatic," said Kariya, 19, the former University of Maine player who 
starred for Canada in the Winter Olympics and World Championships. "I'm really 
excited. At the same time, I'm relieved the negotiating process is over and I 
finally get to play hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the Ducks made Kariya a very rich rookie by NHL standards, giving 
the fourth overall selection in the 1993 NHL draft a contract that will pay him 
an average of $2.166 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 That's more than 1993's second overall choice, Chris Pronger, got from the 
Hartford Whalers, who gave him a four-year, $7-million deal worth an average of 
$1.75 million a year. Kariya also wound up with more money than the Ducks gave 
their second overall pick this year, defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky, who signed a 
three-year, $4.2-million contract paying an average of $1.4 million a year on 
Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it's more than the Ducks implied they'd ever pay an unproven rookie, 
calling the contracts of Pronger and Ottawa's Alexandre Daigle last year 
"aberrations." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, if Daigle's five-year, $12.25-million contract ($2.45 million a 
year) is converted from Canadian to U.S. dollars, Kariya will average more. 
</P>
<P>
 The signing caps a spending spree by the Ducks, who had the NHL's lowest 
payroll last season at $7.8 million but have since spent nearly $13.5 million 
on draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we proved we're serious about improving our team," Ferreira said. The 
Ducks won 33 games in their first season, sharing an NHL expansion record with 
Florida, but the team had the worst power play in the NHL and struggled 
offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira said Kariya's performance since the '93 draft, when he was considered 
a skilled and imaginative playmaker who might be too small for the NHL, 
justified the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has proved himself over and above anyone else in that draft," Ferreira 
said. "Paul has really taken himself to a different level. He went to the 
Olympics and the World Championships, and at the World Championships he was 
playing among all those NHL players. He was (Canada's) leading scorer and one 
of the outstanding players of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we've gotten the two best players in the last two drafts. We got both 
of the players we rated No. 1. We rated Kariya No. 1 and we rated Tverdovsky 
No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kariya negotiations didn't start until after the 1994 Winter Games at 
Lillehammer, Norway, when the Ducks made an initial offer worth less than $1 
million a year. They stalled this summer when agent Don Baizley said that if 
Kariya didn't reach terms with the Ducks this year, he should become an 
unrestricted free agent next June since he would be too old to return to the 
draft under NHL rules as most unsigned players do. 
</P>
<P>
 The stalemate didn't break until the Ducks met with Kariya and Baizley last 
week, raised their original offer by more than a $1 million and told them it 
would be their last and best. 
</P>
<P>
 Club President Tony Tavares said: "We respect Paul, but he's a piece of a 
puzzle as opposed to the entire puzzle. I don't want people getting their 
expectation level to where they expect a 19-year-old guy to score 50 goals and 
have 70 assists. He still has to make the adjustment." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson is delighted to add Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't have the ability to do a lot of things creative offensively 
last year," Wilson said. "Now we've got people with the creativity and 
imagination to create things and we need to finish off the chances they create. 
I wasn't disappointed in our shots on goal, just our ability to finish them 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 He envisions Kariya playing wing with center Anatoli Semenov, another skillful 
playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who he's paired off with on the wing would depend on the situation," Wilson 
said. "It could be a skill guy like Valeri Karpov or a Garry Valk, or in the 
event things get a little physical, a Todd Ewen or a Stu Grimson."

MIKE DOWNEY: RAIDERS RULE IN EARLY FRENZY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a few weeks ago, they wined and dined in Spain inside a palace that Al 
Davis, the count of El Segundo, rented for the evening. For the remainder of 
the summer, Art Shell put them through a 50-days-of-hell training camp that 
left them too pooped to party, preparing the Raiders for what could be their 
season of seasons, one that begins Monday in the San Francisco moonlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Togetherness through hard days and easy ones could take the Raiders a long way 
this season. Take it from running back Harvey Williams, who, black cap turned 
backward, hoop earring dangling, already says: "This team is so different from 
Kansas City, it's almost funny. Kansas City had all these I-I-I guys who mostly 
cared about themselves. The Raiders are a real team." 
</P>
<P>
 And Harvey just got here. 
</P>
<P>
 As the season begins, they have many things going for them, the Raiders do, 
including a home stadium that has been jackhammered and patched back together 
with everything but Krazy Glue, a rugged new fullback courtesy of the 49ers 
themselves, a defense that looks younger and stronger and an Air Raider 
aerospace attack that includes a Jett, a Rocket and a Wright brother. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have Shell, the coach who looks and sounds as mellow as we have ever 
seen or heard him. No longer new on the job, and free of the personal ailments 
that aggravated him last spring, Shell is in shape and so is his team. After 
working his men into a froth, he eased them like stallions through a five-game 
road workout that resulted in four victories, important or not. No one got 
seriously hurt, and the competition was so good that Shell found himself saying 
farewell to receivers who had just made spectacular catches. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell himself has been a definite factor in the Raiders' progress. Even the 
newest of Raiders notice that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man is in command," Williams says, emphatically. "This is by far the best 
football camp I've ever been around, and he's the reason. There are guys on 
this team who would lay down and die for Art Shell." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasn't it that way in Kansas City? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ha! Not hardly," Williams says. 
</P>
<P>
 It sure does help to have a coach who has the support and faith of the 
players, same as it does having such a quarterback. While the arrival of Jeff 
Hostetler last season was not exactly a godsend, let's simply say that the New 
York Giants should feel free to put the big pointy dunce hats on their heads 
and go stand in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler is a strong leader and a wild joker who throws straight passes and 
avoids straight answers. He can kid his way through practically anything, as 
when someone asked whether he had sought out newcomer Tom Rathman for advice on 
how to attack the 49ers next week, considering the fullback's obvious working 
knowledge of that fine organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," Hostetler replies, "Tommy doesn't know anything about football." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Shell almost pride themselves on ducking and dodging nimbly around any 
prying question, as though the answer might reveal something important to some 
San Francisco spy. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach is asked, "Did you ask Rathman about the 49ers?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shell smiles a sly Garfield-the-cat kind of smile and responds, "Well, 
assuming that we did, why should we tell you ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, it ain't like we intend to leak to the 49ers that traitor Rathman has 
been telling the Raiders all about their top-secret triple-reverse Statue of 
Liberty play in which Jerry Rice secretly hides the football under his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell says, "Well, we haven't sat anybody down and asked him about San 
Francisco, if that's what you mean. It's more like, 'If there's something we 
should know, let us know. We're not going to interrogate you. Volunteer!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Opening at night at Candlestick Park is no day at the beach, so it is entirely 
conceivable that the Raiders will start this season 0-1, despite their 
considerable talent. Then again, this is "Monday Night Football," and the 
record shows that the Raiders don't take the blows on Mondays, they deliver 
them. It should be a hell of a game, and there are those who even see it as a 
Super Bowl preview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's 'those?' " inquires Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Those,' " we explain. "Same as 'some.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Super Bowl, huh?" says Hoss, who has been there. "Hey, that would be nice." 
</P>
<P>
 He could take them there. Before this season is over, Hostetler might even 
need his new Audiblizer helmet eventually to be heard over the noise. Repairs 
to the Coliseum are nearly complete, and we trust the grass will be cut smooth 
and low so that Hostetler can send Air Raiders Tim Brown, James Jett, Rocket 
Ismail, Alexander Wright and Daryl Hobbs flying downfield with the old reliable 
"Run Like Hell" play. You know, Carl Lewis could play for the Raiders if he 
wasn't so slow. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense? Not many teams could sacrifice Greg Townsend and lose Howie Long 
and yet rarely mention their names in training camp. The Raiders are 
natural-born hitters. Chester McGlockton's busted leg is strong again, so look 
out for this guy. He is about ready to bust out and become a big star in this 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 But you never know what can happen until it happens. We like to think Kansas 
City made a big mistake letting Williams and Albert Lewis go, and we like to 
think Scott Davis is back bigger and better than ever, and we like to think 
that Kevin Gogan won't look back longingly in his rear-view mirror toward 
Dallas even once. We like to think the Raiders will start fast and finish 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell says, "We'd like to come out of the chute flying." 
</P>
<P>
 Turn 'em loose.

FRACTURED FAIRY TALE; UCLA'S ROD SMALLEY GETS A BREAK HIS WAY FOR ONCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Smalley's hip bone is connected to his wrist bone, and although that 
refutes Gray's Anatomy and messes up some song lyrics, it gives UCLA an inside 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Smalley bears matching scars on his wrists, each of which is held together 
with pins, plates, wire and surgical magic, and he has probably played more 
games with a cast than without. 
</P>
<P>
 He has learned enough about bones to be an orthopedic surgeon. His case 
history is a medical 
</P>
<P>
 student's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there was the broken right wrist, suffered during spring football 
practice of 1992, then shattered in the season-opening game against Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 After it was set in another cast, Smalley played the rest of the game and the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the wrist was examined again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went several months with it in a cast, and the bone died," Smalley said. 
</P>
<P>
 To revive it, three plugs of bone from his hip, each about the diameter of his 
little finger, were transplanted into the wrist. He was ready to play again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except for the hip," he said. "That hurt worst of all. I couldn't stand up 
straight, couldn't run, couldn't go to school, couldn't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he broke his left wrist this past spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to pin it right away," Smalley said. "Pin it and screw down a 
little plate on it so it wouldn't die and it would be ready for the fall." 
</P>
<P>
 By then, his fall plans had changed. Smalley had spent two seasons caddying 
for Jamir Miller at outside linebacker, and Miller was gone to the NFL. Logic 
and seniority told Smalley it was his turn at the defense's glamour position -- 
at UCLA, they call their pass-rushing linebacker the "stud" -- but Coach Terry 
Donahue told him something else. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'We want to get you, Shane (Jasper) and Donnie (Edwards), everybody 
that will help us play, on the field at the same time,' " Smalley said. "Then 
he said, 'Would you mind moving to inside linebacker?'  
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I'd love to.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The change had its roots in meetings of the coaching staff in the weeks after 
the Rose Bowl loss to Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside linebacker coach Tim Hundley asked for Smalley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a difficult thing," Hundley said. "You had Anthony Jones coming 
back off a redshirt year, and you had a lot of other outside candidates. Phil 
Ward was back." 
</P>
<P>
 And Nkosi Littleton and Carrick O'Quinn weren't back at inside linebacker. 
Moving Smalley into one of their spots seemed natural. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got good physical skills," Hundley said. "He's strong, he's tough and 
he's a nasty kind of a guy. He could play inside, and if you look around, 
you'll see there weren't a lot of other candidates. We're thankful we have 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 The skills are different -- there's more pass coverage than pass rush -- but 
at least the position is his after two seasons of waiting for coaches to take 
roll, determining whether Miller was there, and then deciding what Smalley 
would be doing that day. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Miller was perhaps the best pass rusher in UCLA history. In two 
seasons, he led the Bruins in sacks and last year as a junior, was an 
All-American. Then he left school and became a first-round draft choice of the 
Arizona Cardinals, the 10th player chosen in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 From the decision to start him in 1992 to the time he left in late '93, Miller 
was often injured, occasionally indifferent and, on two occasions, in trouble 
with the law, all with a smile and a certain shyness that seemed to make 
everyone willing to accept him for what he was. 
</P>
<P>
 He was an enigma, no sure bet to be at practice from Monday through Friday 
because of illness or, at least once, because his car was towed away. But on 
Saturday he was a defensive force that last season helped put UCLA in the Rose 
Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They couldn't move me because whenever Jamir was hurt or he was in trouble, 
well, they just didn't know," Smalley said. "I started the Cal game (because 
Miller was suspended for one game after pleading no-contest to a charge of 
receiving stolen goods), and the Nebraska game because we used two studs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I was down. He's an incredible athlete and he needed to play. He's a 
great pass rusher, and we needed that. So every week I tried to prepare like I 
was starting, because you never knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Smalley started four games, adding Oregon State because of the two-stud lineup 
and Arizona State because Miller had pinched a nerve in his neck. Smalley made 
24 tackles, got two sacks and broke up two passes. He sat out the Brigham Young 
and San Diego State games because of a neck injury that seemed minor, at least 
in his mind, after what he had gone through with his right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Smalley played in the Rose Bowl game, then got ready for his senior season, 
which begins Saturday evening against Tennessee in Pasadena, determined that 
1994 would be his best year. 
</P>
<P>
 His switch to inside linebacker in the spring lasted four days before he broke 
his left wrist. But the transition was barely affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "He picks up things extremely fast," Hundley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of spring practice made Smalley eager for two-a-day workouts to begin 
this summer. "Everybody thought I was crazy," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not a bad attribute for an inside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 His wrists ache daily, something he will have to deal with as long as he is 
playing a position that puts a premium on the arms and hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's a small price to pay," he said. "I love football and it's getting me 
a free education." 
</P>
<P>
 No, he has paid plenty for it.

PRO FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; THE SURVIVAL; CRITICISM AIMED AT KNOX WOULD 
BE BETTER DIRECTED AT HIS PLAYERS, COLLEAGUES BELIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It begins with a whisper: Chuck Knox, 62, is too old to get the job done any 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 It becomes a question: Has the game passed him by? 
</P>
<P>
 The television cameras linger favorably upon a fiery Bill Cowher, an energetic 
Dave Wannstedt, an enthusiastic Dennis Green. 
</P>
<P>
 Commentators note that Marv Levy takes teams to the Super Bowl, Jimmy Johnson 
wins the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 It's common knowledge: Dan Reeves rebuilds the Giants overnight; Buddy Ryan 
sells tickets to Cardinal games; Mike Holmgren puts the Packers in 
</P>
<P>
 the playoffs; Bill Parcells revs up fans in New England. 
</P>
<P>
 And Chuck Knox has lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 49ers are going to continue to dominate the NFC West Division," said Pat 
Haden, TV commentator and former Ram. "It's just not going to happen in the 
next two years for the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 But it has to happen this year, and in sensational fashion, for Chuck Knox to 
remain employed. He might have two years remaining on a four-year contract, but 
around the NFL it's almost a foregone conclusion: Chuck Knox is history -- save 
a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is time running out? asked Joe Vitt, Knox's friend and Ram assistant coach. 
"Yes. We've been here for two years and we've built this football team in 
Chuck's image. The expectancy is there, the performance must be there and we 
have got to be held accountable for what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 As if it matters. If the Rams are going to move, they are not going to sully 
their fresh start elsewhere with a stale coach. If the Rams are not going to 
move, they are not going to regain the affection of long-lost fans with Chuck 
Knox droning, "Football players win football games." 
</P>
<P>
 Leave, stay -- no matter. Chuck Knox can't win. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Knox's car sits covered with a tarpaulin at training camp, day after day, 
night after night. He won't be going home or dining out. The man who is too old 
to coach is right on top of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox has that fine focus, as he likes to say, and there is no doubt who is in 
charge here. But it is 10 p.m. and he is still reviewing videotape, concerned 
about an offensive line not fulfilling expectations and getting nowhere in his 
daylong efforts to correct the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems, and more problems, and it has been five frustrating years since a 
Knox-coached team has fared any better than third place in its division. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Bills and the Seattle Seahawks were very Ram-like when Knox 
arrived, but never so bad later under his tutelage as the Rams (11-21) have 
continued to be. 
</P>
<P>
 What's wrong with the Rams? On paper they appear so much stronger, but on the 
field they show no spark, none of the competitive toughness that traditionally 
characterizes a Knox-coached team. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins again with a whisper: Chuck Knox is just mailing it in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't buy it," said Joe Gibbs, TV commentator and former coach of the 
Washington Redskins. "I talked to Chuck this off-season, and I was out there in 
Anaheim this last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember going off into a corner with Chuck and asking, 'Why are you doing 
this?' The man's got enough money and things like that where he doesn't need 
this, but I asked, 'Why are you doing this?' 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked me right in the eye and growled, 'I want to win the Super Bowl.' 
Shoot, I felt it; he's driven inside to do that, and I think the Rams are very 
fortunate to have a guy who's proven and who has a formula. Those kinds of guys 
are very hard to find." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Knox Football: Immediately, a no-nonsense image presents itself. The man 
has a specific way of doing things and has been successful doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were 54-15 in his first tour of duty in Southern California. He took 
doormat Buffalo to a division title and duplicated the feat in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have a formula, a way of getting the job done," Gibbs said. "Very 
few guys have it really. . . . You take a Bill Parcells team and it will have 
its own look. He has a formula; give him enough time and he's going to produce 
a winner. That's Chuck. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't many people who have been able to do that, and Chuck's been able 
to do it with more than one group of people. He's done it over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox has been doing this for 21 years as a head coach, and only Don Shula, 
George Halas, Tom Landry, Curly Lambeau and Chuck Noll have more victories in 
the NFL. Knox is the only coach in the 75-year history of the league to win 
division championships for three organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "His football teams are sound, not very flamboyant, but sound," said Boston 
College Coach Dan Henning, who coached against Knox while at San Diego, 
Detroit, Atlanta and Washington. "He always had a scheme that was liberal and 
flamboyant, but you knew he wouldn't come after you that way until it was 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believes in percentages. Go back to that Seattle team. They would be 
behind, and a number of times they'd come back in flamboyant fashion to win. 
People would say how come he doesn't do that all the time? Chuck was smarter 
than that. With the kind of talent he had, if he had played that way all the 
time, he would have lost more games on errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy hasn't won a Super Bowl, but I know this: When you lined up against 
one of his teams, I don't care what kind of talent he had, you knew he was 
capable of beating you." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys, who went on to win the Super Bowl, lost only three 
regular-season games in 1992, including only one at Texas Stadium -- to Knox's 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you trying to tell me Chuck Knox is in a no-win situation?" said Dick 
Vermeil, who has worked with Knox. "No way Chuck Knox is ever in a no-win 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams doubled their victories in his first year back on the job, but last 
season was a tortuous journey that ended 5-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad as it was, there is the memory of an early victory in Houston and the 
tears welling in Knox's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you want to talk Chuck Knox, you call me," Vermeil said. "I know how 
much he cares about what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Watch the sideline, though, and it does not always appear as if Knox is 
breathing. Mike Ditka oozed emotion; Chuck Knox needs to be nudged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intense? There's no doubt it," said Jackie Slater, who has heard more pregame 
speeches than almost anyone else. "You can just feel his expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I ever got to know Chuck, Dennis Harrah told me, 'Chuck Knox will put 
the fear of God in you.' There's just something about the guy that demands 
respect and professionalism. There's no doubt in my mind why he's been 
successful everywhere he's gone: He just demands it. He doesn't say all that 
much; it's just his presence." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are losing, however, and Mt. Rushmore has failed to inspire. The team 
has provided no hope to date for better days ahead this season, and there are 
those whispers, those questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, lining up off-sides is not Chuck Knox being too old," Vitt said. "We 
have a young tackle lining up off-sides five times. Now, is he doing that 
because Chuck Knox is senile? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's coaching exactly the same way now as he did when we were in the AFC 
championship game in Seattle. He's going to let his players play and his 
coaches coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddsmakers in Las Vegas say that won't be enough to change the Rams' fortunes. 
They have set the over-and-under for the number of games the Rams will win this 
year at five. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man has overcome adversity all his life," said Reggie McKenzie, a Seahawk 
executive who played for Knox. "Oh, what a motivator, the very best." 
</P>
<P>
 But with the Rams lately, motivation hasn't been enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a game of people, and if you don't have the people you're in trouble," 
said Hank Stram, TV commentator and former NFL coach. "What were they saying 
about Tom Landry and Chuck Noll a few years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just ridiculous to say the game has passed him by. That's like saying 
five years after competing in the Olympics, a swimmer can't swim anymore. How 
stupid can you be? 
</P>
<P>
 "How old was Ronald Reagan when he was President of the United States? If he's 
not too old to be President, Chuck Knox is not too old to coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a team there that's talking about moving, the fans are very 
lethargic, and that rubs off on the players. It's tough enough to win when 
things are going good." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a way to win when no one expects such success has been a Knox 
trademark. Buffalo had been dreadful, and after rebuilding with 5-11 and 7-9 
campaigns, including consecutive 0-4 performances in exhibitions, Knox's Bills 
leapfrogged to 11-5 to win the AFC East title. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Curt Warner, "the franchise" in Seattle, suffered a season-ending 
knee injury in the 1984 opener. It appeared that the Seahawks were finished, 
but Knox guided them to 12-4 and into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows how to win," said Mike McCormack, Carolina Panther general manager 
and former Seahawk general manager. "We go to Miami for a playoff game, we have 
to wait five hours in an airport for a plane to be fixed, we get to our hotel 
at 3 a.m. and it's one big potential disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck doesn't blink. He puts in a new formation on Saturday morning, it works 
and we win. Incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 But could he do that with the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell me, who is going to coach that team to an NFC West Division 
championship?" Haden said. "The organization has drafted miserably over the 
years, and while it's been corrected some since Chuck's arrival, the talent 
level has been down for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say what you want about Chuck Knox, and I honestly can't say if the game has 
passed him by, but what coach can win with that personnel?" 
</P>
<P>
 The way Knox had it figured, he was going to coach this team into winning. A 
year ago, he was talking playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck went down there thinking he had an outstanding quarterback in Jim 
Everett," McCormack said. "Chuck had never had that great quarterback before. 
He did the job with Dave Krieg in Seattle, James Harris and Pat Haden with the 
Rams, Joe Ferguson in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of us empathize with Chuck, because with Jim Everett it seemed 
like he had that quality quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Knox begins anew with Chris Miller, but with Keith Loneker, Clarence 
Jones and Darryl Ashmore blocking for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I judge him now versus 18 years ago when I was playing for him, he's 
probably hungrier to win now than then," Slater said. "I can relate to some of 
the things he's dealing with. 
</P>
<P>
 "People wonder because of my age if I still have that fire, that desire, and 
when I hear that, it just turns up my intensity." 
</P>
<P>
 But another losing season appears all but guaranteed for he Rams, and just 
where will that leave Knox? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will bring back a lot of the old Chuck, that old steel mill 
guy," said Lawrence McCutcheon, a Ram scout who played for Knox. "I know that 
will be his reaction. I think he will show us all that he still has that fire, 
that desire to win. I wouldn't want to tell him there's no chance of winning." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sit across the desk from Knox and ask those questions: Are you too old? Has 
the game passed you by? Have you just mailed it in? 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of the most accommodating and accessible coaches in the NFL. He will 
never make Bartlett's "Familiar Quotations," but this is a gentleman who 
conducts business fairly at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's why you can sit across the desk and ask those questions, along with 
several more. 
</P>
<P>
 So, are you too old to keep doing this? 
</P>
<P>
 Knox: "Is Marv Levy too old? Don Shula? I hear this stuff, and yes, it hurts, 
but I'm working as hard as I can work." 
</P>
<P>
 Has the game passed you by? 
</P>
<P>
 Knox: "I don't think it's passed us by. We had the best organized training 
camp we've had. I think we're on top of the thing, and no, I don't think I'm 
taking things a step slower." 
</P>
<P>
 Are you just mailing it in? 
</P>
<P>
 Knox: "I didn't get to where I am today without working hard. If this 
situation doesn't get turned around, it won't be because we didn't work hard." 
</P>
<P>
 But people are looking for more -- they want someone to turn this program 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox: "I don't know where that person is." 
</P>
<P>
 It's supposed to be you. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox: "I think I have as good a chance as anybody to do it because I've done 
it. Who are you going to get that's done it before?" 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think it's a no-win situation, what with the prospect of moving or not 
moving? 
</P>
<P>
 Knox: "Do you think if there was a 35-year-old coach here in his third year on 
the job under the same circumstances, the same thing wouldn't apply? 
</P>
<P>
 "The only defense I can offer is that I have worked hard, and now we just have 
to wait and see what the outcome is going to be. If we don't achieve the goals 
we have set, somebody else has to make the decision about whether Chuck Knox is 
going to coach this team or not." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Long hours, more videotape, and Knox doesn't figure to go quietly into the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's take a look at it this way," Vitt said. "Here's a man who, because of 
this game, is financially independent. Here's a man who has raised four great 
kids. Here's a man who has three grandchildren he adores. And here's a man 
doing something, not because he has to do it, but because he wants to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could walk away at any time, but he made the statement to me, 'Palm 
Springs is God's waiting room to die,' and he's not ready to retire to his 
condo in Palm Springs. He's still ready to get after some people, and that 
ought to make a lot of people in this league concerned."

PRO FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; THE REVIVAL; FANS IN ARIZONA ARE SURE THAT 
BUDDY RYAN, THEIR NEW COACH, WILL SCARE THE CARDINALS INTO ACTUALLY WINNING 
SOMETHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here on the banks of Big Bug Creek, where about 1,000 souls are by-God proving 
there still exist people with spurs on their heels and dirt under their nails, 
they know a thing or two about disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 They know about sticking shovels in the dry creek bed, again and again, for 
days and weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 They know about spending a lifetime digging up little more than a down payment 
on porch furniture for one of those mobile homes that have turned these barren 
hills into aluminum canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Some from this Central Arizona town are farmers, some are ranchers, but nearly 
everybody is also a gold prospector. 
</P>
<P>
 By definition, the last people on earth to give up hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The last people who can truly grasp the meaning of the word genuine . 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy's people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing about Buddy Ryan is, he is one of us," said Bob Briske, a painter 
and prospector sitting in front of a copper cup in the darkened Double D Bar 
one recent scorching afternoon. "We like to act like ourselves up here. That's 
how Buddy is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other coaches coming 
</P>
<P>
 through here couldn't get the job done. Buddy gets it done, no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 Briske smiled through his tangled gray beard. "We like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how last February's shotgun wedding between the NFL's most 
controversial coach and its worst franchise ends up, one thing is for certain. 
</P>
<P>
 James David (Buddy) Ryan and the Arizona Cardinals have had a heck of a first 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Ryan leads the Cardinals into Anaheim Stadium for the season 
opener Sunday against the Rams, don't be surprised if half of Arizona isn't 
wearing black straw hats and accusing each other of being "dumb, dumb, dumb." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised if bosses at Phoenix-area businesses stop issuing 
traditional warnings to poor performers and just start firing them on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for fist fights between mid-level insurance executives. Look for managers 
to start referring to employees not by names, but payroll numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't look for an empty seat at Sun Devil Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Ryan was hired on Feb. 3 amid a mixture of chuckles and cringes, the 
Cardinals have undergone what is believed to be the most prolific off-season 
rebirth of a franchise in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
 Season-ticket sales have increased 93.7% from last year, to more than 48,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal merchandise sales at the official team shop have increased more than 
700%. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of radio affiliates has doubled to 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Cardinal license plates on an employee's car was recently 
reduced from one to zero. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plates were stolen," Cardinal owner Bill Bidwill said with a smile. "When 
that happened, I knew we had arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals also may have arrived when somebody working out of the back of a 
pickup truck actually printed a T-shirt commemorating their only preseason 
intrasquad scrimmage at Flagstaff. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will there be more bodies at Sun Devil Stadium, there will even be 
body bags . 
</P>
<P>
 A Phoenix disc jockey has given the nickname "Tombstone Defense" to Ryan's 
favorite unit, and promised to hang one body bag over the upper-deck railing at 
Sun Devil Stadium for every sack. 
</P>
<P>
 All for a franchise that has not won a championship since 1947 . . . or even 
won a legitimate playoff game since then. 
</P>
<P>
 And all for a man who has also never won a playoff game as a head coach, a man 
who is best known not for any one play, but for a . . . punch? 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't hear anybody mention a punch. Did you hear somebody mention a punch? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never asked him about the punch," Bidwill said. 
</P>
<P>
 We are referring to the right-cross Ryan threw at Houston offensive 
coordinator Kevin Gilbride on the sideline during a nationally televised game 
last season when Ryan was the Oilers' defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, despite three seasons of double-figure victories as head coach of 
the Philadelphia Eagles, despite his Super Bowl ring as a defensive coordinator 
for the 1985 Chicago Bears, most thought he would never be hired as a head 
coach again. 
</P>
<P>
 But most forgot about Bidwill, the only NFL owner to own bolo ties and a 
photographic memory of the NFL in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men feel like isolated throwbacks. Both want one more chance at success 
before they can no longer walk the sidelines. They got together for a match 
made in black-and-white. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the man for the time," Bidwill said. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a remarkable time it has been. It started on that early spring day 
when Ryan actually led a downtown Phoenix parade on horseback. It led to the 
craziness of souvenir sales at a practice. 
</P>
<P>
 People actually bought those scrimmage T-shirts, at $15 apiece, even though 
the bold letters on the front read: " Inner -squad." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Ryan reacted as if he were suffering from an inner-squad infection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping that rain would get here," he grumbled, looking up at the dark 
clouds that seem to follow him. "We made mental mistakes that there was no 
excuse for. . . . Every time (backup quarterback Jim) McMahon audibled, half of 
them didn't pick up the audible. . . . You shouldn't get beat mentally. We got 
beat mentally on defense a few times, and I think our offensive line got beat 
mentally some." 
</P>
<P>
 He finished his chat by vowing to cut a player within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Which, a day later, he did. A guy he referred to only as "Fatso." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his constant rips, though, Ryan has vowed to bring this state a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Do it even though he'll rarely mention his players by anything other than the 
numbers on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Do it even though this team averaged one fight per practice -- during 
mini-camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Do it now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people are excited because they know Buddy Ryan is a winner, because they 
know I will have a team that will not back off from anybody," Ryan said. "I 
tell the players we will make the playoffs . . . because we will make the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 When they step on to the field in Anaheim on Sunday, half of the Cardinal 
players will be scared to death of losing their jobs, the other half will be 
looking to take a tension-releasing swing at somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the front-office employees are gleefully discussing increased profits, 
the other half are nervously waiting for Buddy to start ripping them . 
</P>
<P>
 In the Double D Bar, and hundreds of meeting places like it throughout 
Arizona, there is no such diversity of opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, for now, they are content to raise their copper cups in thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally got a guy who tells people either to play or get on the bus and go 
home," said Ken Swindle, a construction worker from nearby Prescott Valley. 
"That's how it is around here, ain't it? Do your job or get out? 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a guy doing that to those high-paid football players. We got us a 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After each practice in the Cardinals' training camp, a member of the team's 
publicity staff pulled a small white box off the back of the equipment truck. 
</P>
<P>
 This box, more important than any helmet or pad, was dropped at Ryan's feet as 
he walked off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan stopped, stepped on the box so everyone could see him, then imparted his 
wisdom to a circle of about 30 reporters hanging on every joke or insult. 
</P>
<P>
 "This box is nice," Ryan said. "Maybe now they ought to get me a crown." 
</P>
<P>
 You mean they haven't already? Ryan was given far more than the title of coach 
and general manager last February when he was hired away from the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 He was given the keys to Bidwill's kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Bidwill) has been great. . . . He gave me this job just the way I wanted 
it," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ryan has not been shy about leaving footprints. 
</P>
<P>
 His coaching staff contains four new hires who worked with him during his five 
years with the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 And two new hires who were former Eagle players. 
</P>
<P>
 And two more new hires named Rex and Rob Ryan. They are Buddy's 31-year-old 
twin sons, most recently assistant coaches at Morehead State and Tennessee 
State, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the only kids on the block who never missed curfew," Rex said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those eight new employees, only half of them coached in the NFL last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize that if things don't go well here, we're all going to take the 
heat," Rex said. "But hey, that's part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan's juggling of the roster has received considerably more applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his presence, the Cardinals were able to acquire two of the top 
available free-agent defensive players in the off-season, former Eagle 
linebacker Seth Joyner and defensive end Clyde Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 He added other notable favorite players in linebacker Wilber Marshall, backup 
quarterback McMahon, safety Andre Waters and punter Jeff Feagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he rid the Cardinals of numerous malcontents and high-priced 
players who mostly stood around. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 28 of the 53 players who ended last season on the roster are still with 
the team. The starting lineup Sunday will include seven new starters on defense 
and four new starters on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any wonder that at times this summer, the Cardinals had the only 
training camp that resembled a penal colony? 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon, Ryan was looking at some of his injured players riding 
stationary bikes on the sidelines and musing: "Some of our guys who are hurt, 
they like to hang out and sign autographs and eat and drink a lot. . . . Well, 
I know who those guys are, and those guys will be dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, many of those same players were hauling wheelbarrows of sand 
up and down the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told (strength coach) Bob Rogucki to put those . . . to work," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some former standouts were simply cut, such as safety and local favorite Chuck 
Cecil. Others threw up their hands and walked out the door, such as former 
All-American safety Ken Swilling. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of tension around here, a lot of people worried about their 
jobs," kicker Greg Davis said. "In this situation, people usually do something 
absolutely phenomenal . . . or they just fold up." 
</P>
<P>
 Which, according to Ryan, is exactly the point of the insults and threats and 
on-field cursing that rippled through the large pines surrounding their 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players get through this, hell, the real games will be easy." Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have survived, according to Ryan's former players, constitute a 
hard-working group willing to walk through flames for their coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start off hating Buddy Ryan, everybody does," Waters said. "He used to 
spend half of practice yelling at me, 'Hey 20, hey 20, you're dumb, dumb, 
dumb.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But then you realize, he'll take the heat for you. He'll take all of the 
criticism that could be going to you. He'll wear the black hat." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if the Cardinals lose six of their first eight games, as they did last 
season, it is difficult to imagine anybody but Buddy Ryan being ripped for such 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buddy will do that for you, he'll take full blame for every loss, every 
problem," Waters said. "That's why players will run through walls for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters' clearest memory of Ryan with the Eagles, of course, involves nothing 
so chivalrous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing San Diego in 1986, I hit Gary Anderson after he has run out of 
bounds, I get a penalty," Waters recalled. "Buddy grabbed my facemask and said, 
'If you get one more penalty, I'm knocking your teeth out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Waters said at that moment, he made an important decision about his new coach. 
"If that man came after me again, I was going to run," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That same fear exists today, even among the smartest and most streetwise of 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Steve Beuerlein, who has survived the wrath of Al Davis, is 
watching where he walks. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, you wake up and Buddy loves you," Beuerlein said. "The next day, he 
can turn on you pretty good. You have to try to stay on his good side." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Beuerlein set a Cardinal accuracy record last season by connecting 
on 61.7% of his passes, he knows that Ryan-favorite McMahon is now directly 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 But what of such potential conflicts between players? What of such things as 
the free-for-all team brawl that occurred during one of Ryan's "voluntary" 
workouts? 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan has pushed players past the point of mental and physical stability 
before. This, some say, has accounted for their tendencies to play tight in big 
games, causing losses to teams with more maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 Witness the talented Oilers' defeat by the Kansas City Chiefs in last season's 
AFC semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston receiver Ernest Givins said: "(Ryan) put the good, the bad and the 
ugly in this organization. With him, you can win some games, but the big games 
will come back to haunt you and beat you." 
</P>
<P>
 But the veterans here expect no such trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in my career, I'm listening to a guy who is not afraid to 
talk about going to the playoffs," said Davis, who has been on the winning team 
only 26 times in seven seasons. "My other coaches have always talked only about 
competing, but this guy says we will go to the playoffs, and here's how. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players love to hear that. Players respond to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bidwill also said he is not expecting any trouble -- or at least any public 
insults about his mannerisms or appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buddy and I have many things in common," Bidwill said. "Nothing has happened 
yet, and I don't expect anything to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan makes no such promises, saying only that his team will win and that he 
will remain beloved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, it's not just Phoenix, I would have gotten the same response if I had 
come to Los Angeles," Ryan said. "People everywhere love a winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine if he had hit Hollywood. How long would it take before people were 
comparing his sayings to those of, say, Forrest Gump. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, Buddy, have you seen "Forrest Gump"? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so," Buddy replied. "What position does he play?" Buddy's World 
</P>
<P>
 Some outtakes from the mouth of Buddy Ryan, first-year coach of the Arizona 
Cardinals: 
</P>
<P>
 * On running back Garrison Hearst's slow rehabilitation from a knee injury: 
"He looks good standing there watching practice. He didn't make any mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 * After Hearst, a former first-round draft choice, was put on the physically 
unable to perform list: "He'll probably be on PUP the rest of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 * On whether he was interested in signing former Denver Bronco linebacker Karl 
Mecklenburg: "He was a great player in college when he came out of Minnesota, 
but it has been about 30 years. He ought to be coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 * On former UCLA linebacker Jamir Miller, a first-round draft pick who 
reported two weeks late, then suffered a groin injury: "Jamir Miller is babying 
himself. He's got a pulled groin. I guess he still thinks he's at UCLA. He's 
tired. . . . The trainers say there isn't anything the matter with him. I guess 
he just wants to take his money and put it in his hip pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 * On second-round pick Chuck Levy, a running back and punt returner who 
struggled in his first exhibition against the Chicago Bears: "I thought he 
stunk catching punts, or trying to catch punts, or watching punts. He didn't 
catch any of them; he watched them. . . . I'm like those people booing his . . 
. (against the Bears). I was one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 * On whether the NFL should put a franchise in Mexico: "No. I don't like the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 * On linebacker Brett Wallerstedt, who re - injured his left knee and then was 
cut: "He cut himself. . . . Durability is more important than ability." 
</P>
<P>
 * A T-shirt in the window of Ryan's new restaurant, Buddy Ryan's Bar & Grill, 
in downtown Phoenix: "One Way or Another I'm Gonna Punch You." 
</P>
<P>
 * On how center Ed Cunningham handled a brief demotion from the first team: "I 
don't care about . . . personalities. I don't care what he thinks. He could be 
my own son, and it wouldn't matter."

PREP FOOTBALL '94 / GOLDEN WEST LEAGUE; 1993 IN REVIEW; HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the Golden West League's inaugural season. Ocean View, Santa Ana, 
Servite and Westminster move from the Sunset League, and Saddleback and Tustin 
arrive from the Sea View League.None of the teams qualified for the Southern 
Section playoffs last season. Santa Ana senior quarterback Mark Fausto passed 
for 2,064 yards with 13 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He also led the team 
in rushing with 334 yards and three touchdowns. Tustin senior running back 
Lamar Barrett rushed for 663 yards with eight touchdowns. He averaged 6.4 yards 
per carry. Westminster scored its most points of the season in a 43-29 Sunset 
League victory over Santa Ana on Oct. 22. Servite, which lost five of its first 
six games, won two of its last four. The Friars (3-7, 3-4 in Sunset League 
play) were fifth in league, the highest finish among teams in the Golden West 
League. Ocean View came close to ending its losing streak, which reached 29 
games at the end of the 1993 season, on Oct. 22. The Seahawks lost to Servite, 
14-12, in a Sunset League game.

AGASSI DISPLAYS ECSTASY AFTER DEFEATING FORGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A good time was had by all well into the wee hours of Friday morning at the 
U.S. Open. Well, all except veteran Guy Forget of France, who lost a tough 
match to that veteran showman and tennis player Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-set slugfest ended with Agassi hitting a big serve, Forget slapping 
the return past the baseline, and Agassi leading the crowd, including 
girlfriend Brooke Shields, in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (7-5), 6-2, and not lost on a happy Agassi in the 
aftermath was the fact that he had been serving for the match at 5-3 of the 
third set. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I lost that," Agassi said, "I wanted to go to the hospital and have the 
90-pound bullfrog removed surgically from my throat." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no more choking after that, as Agassi closed it out in the 
fourth, much to the delight of what remained of a nearly packed house of 
20,584. And Agassi did so against a dangerous opponent, who was once No. 4 in 
the world and who, at age 29, is still good enough to make a run at a 
quarterfinal or semifinal spot in a Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I feel best about is that, after I lost it in the third, I kept my 
poise and won it," said Agassi, who is beginning to look like a legitimate 
threat on the side of the men's draw that is already missing Goran Ivanisevic 
and Boris Becker. 
</P>
<P>
 On the women's side, top-seeded Steffi Graf strolled into the third round with 
a 6-0, 6-2 workout against Sandra Cacic. Graf hit nine aces and won the point 
on her first serve 92% of the time, dispatching the Florida player in 55 
minutes. She said she wished she had had a tougher match, but she may have to 
continue wishing. Her next opponent is Radka Bobkova of the Czech Republic, 
ranked No. 109, or 68 points below Cacic. 
</P>
<P>
 One opponent Graf certainly wouldn't take lightly is France's Mary Pierce, who 
beat her in the French Open semifinals this year. Pierce struggled a bit in the 
opener of Thursday's night session, eventually defeating Katerina Studenikova 
of Slovakia, who turns 22 today and who almost kept Pierce on the court until 
then before losing, 6-3, 2-6, 6-4. Pierce, seeded No. 3, actually lost more 
points than she won in the match, 85-84, but broke Studenikova four times.

 The two highest-seeded men competing Thursday, No. 3 Sergei Bruguera and No. 9 
Todd Martin, advanced through competitive straight-set matches. Bruguera, the 
two-time defending French Open champion, beat Andrei Olhovskiy of Russia, 7-5, 
6-2, 7-6 (7-5) and Martin defeated Andrei Chesnokov of Russia, 6-3, 7-5, 6-3. 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Former UCLA player Patricia Hy advanced, but former USC student Linda 
Harvey-Wild and Trojan player Caroline Kuhlman were ousted, as was former 
Stanford player Marianne Werdel of Oceanside. . . . Robbie Weiss, who won an 
NCAA title at Pepperdine, was eliminated by Markus Zoecke, the German who upset 
Goran Ivanisevic on the opening day.

SEASON COULD BE OVER IN TWO WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 With no negotiating sessions scheduled for the Labor Day weekend and no 
holiday baseball for the first time since 1894, acting Commissioner Bud Selig 
said Thursday that he will begin to look closely at a possible shutdown date 
for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tragic situation, but sooner or later you reach the point of 
diminishing return," Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed the owners have tentatively set Sept. 15 as the date by which a 
decision has to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with TV advertisers turning away from the uncertainty of the playoffs 
and World Series, the owners no longer have $140 million in TV revenue at stake 
in the postseason and might not feel compelled to wait until the 15th before 
closing on '94 to begin planning the unilateral implementation of their 
salary-cap proposal, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The season could now be called off as early as Sept 10, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were off to a wonderful start, but the advertisers stopped investing in 
early August," Selig said, a reference to the Aug. 12 start of the players' 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible loss of a potential $5 million per club in postseason TV revenue 
compounds a major regular-season setback. In the first half year of the 
partnership with ABC and NBC, each of the clubs has received about $1.5 million 
compared to about $14 million per year during the CBS contract. 
</P>
<P>
 With the plug about to be pulled, federal mediators talked via telephone with 
union and management officials Thursday but still found no reason to call a 
bargaining session. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry McMorris, owner of the Colorado Rockies, continued his informal talks 
with union leader Donald Fehr without substantive results and several players, 
including Randy Tomlin of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Steve Trachsel of the 
Chicago Cubs, went on strike and off salary when recalled from the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the salary-cap proposal continued to generate unprecedented 
unanimity among the owners despite pressure from some high-revenue clubs 
favoring compromise and resumption of the season. Seven to nine of the big 
markets, including the Dodgers, have been keeping phone lines busy, sources 
say, but have been unable to muster enough support.

TWO FAMILIAR FACES TAKE EARLY BOWS; TENNIS: SHRIVER LOSES TO DAVENPORT AND 
LENDL DEFAULTS IN SECOND-ROUND MATCHES AT U.S. OPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With grace and a grimace, the old gave way to the new Thursday on Stadium 
Court at the U.S. Open. The court that has launched so many great careers 
became, on this day, all but a graveyard for two of them. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, at 16, Pam Shriver turned the tennis world on its ear by serving and 
volleying her way into the U.S. Open final, losing only then to Chris Evert. 
Thursday, at 32, before a half-full stadium of half-interested spectators, 
Shriver was sent packing in 53 minutes, including a 19-minute first set, by 
18-year-old Lindsay Davenport of Murrieta. The score was 6-1, 6-2. Shriver 
double faulted on match point. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in 1982, at 22, all the way through 1989, Ivan Lendl reached the 
final of the U.S. Open. He won in '85, '86 and '87. Thursday, at 34, Lendl 
walked off the Stadium Court with a sore back, defaulting his second-round 
match to Bernd Karbacher of Germany while trailing, two sets to love and 1-0 in 
the third. Lendl had held a 5-0 lead in the second set and squandered nine set 
points before losing in a 7-5 tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, like the old Kingston Trio song about riding the MTA in Boston, the 
question is: Will they ever return? 
</P>
<P>
 Shriver addressed that question gracefully and emotionally. Lendl grimaced and 
groused and did his best to not address it at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if this had been her last appearance in the Open, Shriver said, "I think 
there is a very strong chance, but I don't know. No big announcement here. I am 
just saying I will be surprised if I get out there again for singles. I'll be 
very surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 After hitting only 10 winners -- and only two volley winners -- and after 
double faulting on match point, Shriver shook Davenport's hand, gave the young 
player a pat on the back and deflated into her courtside chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind her, the 10- and 11-year-old autograph seekers squealed for Davenport's 
signature. None sought out Shriver, but then, none of them were even born when 
Shriver was having her big years on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, as she usually does, Shriver gathered her composure, signed a few 
autographs for the youngsters on the perimeter of the Davenport cluster, tossed 
her racket to a stunned youngster in the first row and marched out, side by 
side, with Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as she reached the exit, she stopped, took off her sunglasses and took 
one last, long look around the place. Hers appeared to be the actions of 
somebody who didn't expect to be back, at least not in the same circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about that moment later, she said, "Yeah. That was a little bit tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Then she paused for a long time, facial expressions telling all, until the 
tension was broken by somebody joking that she would have had a tough time 
collecting a keepsake sprig of grass, as Martina Navratilova had done on her 
final exit from Wimbledon's Centre Court this year. 
</P>
<P>
 If this was a farewell, Shriver did her best to keep it light and informative. 
She praised Davenport both for her tennis skills and for her handling of all 
the off-court pressures suddenly coming her way as America's current top female 
player. And she even dished out a dose of perspective while talking about 
Davenport's parents, Wink and Ann. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love her parents," Shriver said. "I've never met her parents, but the fact 
that I don't know who they are, I think is terrific. I mean, she has to be the 
first person in the top 10 whose parents I've never met, and I'm crazy about 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Shriver said that she would probably start next season playing singles in 
Australia, and would continue to play doubles, where she has excelled with 22 
Grand Slam event titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it is a long time from January to the U.S. Open," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a great career, and I've never lost sight of all the good things," 
she said. "The expectations were never that great, anyway, because I've got a 
lot of limitations in my game. But you guys know that. You've watched me." 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl's departure with an injury was his second in a row. Last year, he left 
while playing Neil Borwick of Australia, the same player he beat in the first 
round this year. Afterward, any suggestion that this might be it here for Lendl 
was greeted with evasion or debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Forty years from now, when you want to sit with your grandchildren 
and tell them about your U.S. Open experience, what will stand out, what will 
be the one? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Who told you I would want to tell them? 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Just in case you decide to, what will you tell them? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I will tell them that I am 74 years old and I don't remember anything. 
</P>
<P>
 So if Thursday was the end, or if he even had a moment's inkling it might be, 
he wasn't saying. He said the back injury was not career-threatening, that he 
expected doctors to be able to figure out how to correct it and that, if they 
do, he very well might keep going for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is sure. Someday soon, both will know that it's over, that it's time 
to find a real job. Shriver will call a news conference that will turn into a 
party with 10,000 of her closest friends. Lendl will tell his wife and go play 
a round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 And some day, they will probably tell their respective grandchildren that one 
of their favorite places in the world was the Stadium Court at the U.S. Open, 
but that there was this Thursday in 1994, when they were playing on it, and. .

MORNING BRIEFING: IS THERE ANY GUMP-TION WHEN IT COMES TO FICTIONAL HEROES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is a favorite of millions of Alabama fans after scoring a big touchdown 
against rival Tennessee all those years ago. Who cares that he doesn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Crimson Tide officials have spent hours answering questions about former 
football hero Forrest Gump, who according to the hit movie of the same name, 
played under Coach Paul (Bear) Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had several people -- more than several, really -- call and ask," 
sports information director Larry White said. "And this summer, while I was 
speaking to a number of alumni groups, it was the first question I got at 
several stops." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Gene Stallings was an assistant under Bryant about the same time Gump 
was supposed to have played for Alabama. Not long ago, the no-nonsense 
Stallings was asked about the nonexistent Gump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we had him this year," Stallings said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who is Carroll Hardy? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, the shark bites: Last season, the San Jose Sharks were allowed to use San 
Jose Airport eight times after it had closed, for late-night/early-morning 
charter departures. Now, city officials want to grant the team and other users 
of the downtown arena a formal exemption to the curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like the Sharks as much as anybody," said Russ McBrien, a leader of the 
watchdog group Citizens Against Airport Pollution. "The issue for us is, why do 
they have to disappear in the middle of the night? If the Sharks need to get 
out of town, they can catch a cab to (airports in) San Francisco or Oakland." 
</P>
<P>
 Home and road teams that use charter flights like to leave immediately after 
games so they can get to the next city as soon as possible. That way they don't 
have to wake up first thing in the morning, travel and then play. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo chips: Guess who's talking about going to the Super Bowl again? The 
news is good this time, though. Fans in Buffalo aren't even worried anymore 
about winning there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody else is saying, 'Oh, no, not the Bills again. Anybody but them.' 
But I've got news. . . . We're back," said Ken Hyndes, a Bill fan from the 
Buffalo suburb of West Seneca. "I want that bonus game at the end of the season 
again. I don't care if we win it or lose it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Arthur Lupia of San Diego, a Buffalo native and Bill fan: "If at first 
you don't succeed, try, try, try, try again." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Hardy was a career .225 hitter who on May 18, 1958, became the 
only person to pinch-hit for Ted Williams in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle, on Karch Kiraly 
falling off the victory stand after teaming with Kent Steffes to win a 
volleyball championship: "Thus becoming the first athlete in history to 
celebrate by spiking himself." SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: SILVER ANNIVERSARY OFF TO GOLDEN START WITH RAIDERS, 
49ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who needs baseball? Football is here, and what a weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The USC and UCLA openers Saturday are both on ABC. Fox makes its NFL 
regular-season debut on Sunday with Dallas and Pittsburgh. NBC has Joe Montana 
and the Kansas City Chiefs against New Orleans. TNT has the San Diego Chargers 
at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 But the event of the holiday weekend is Monday night's game between the 
Raiders and San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 What a way for ABC to kick off its 25th anniversary season of "Monday Night 
Football." Fittingly, the Raiders have the best Monday night record, 30-12-1, 
and the 49ers have the second-best, 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Monday night: Al Michaels, Frank Gifford and Dan Dierdorf are beginning 
their eighth season together. Believe it or not, no other three-man "Monday 
Night Football" team has been together longer. 
</P>
<P>
 They must be doing something right. "Monday Night Football" has ranked as one 
of the top-10 prime-time shows on television the last four years. Only "60 
Minutes" and "Roseanne" can make the same claim. 
</P>
<P>
 During the so-called "golden years," in the late '70s and early '80s when 
Gifford, Howard Cosell and Don Meredith were in the booth, the series got 
higher ratings but didn't rank nearly as high among the competition. In 1978 
and '79, it ranked 31st and 34th. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these are the golden years," Michaels said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's got a point. Think about it. Which announcing team would you rather have? 
</P>
<P>
 There is no better network play-by-play announcer than Michaels. To borrow a 
phrase from his old Arizona State chum Reggie Jackson, he's the straw that 
stirs the drink. 
</P>
<P>
 Dierdorf at times has been overbearing, but he seems to have found his comfort 
zone. The thing is, he shows up prepared, something Don Meredith was never 
accused of. 
</P>
<P>
 Gifford is still "likable Frank," the constant who has been with the series 
for all but the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosell? It seems that he's now being remembered fondly, but back when he was 
doing "Monday Night Football" many could not stand him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last add Monday night: Lynn Swann has been added as a sideline reporter, 
something the NFL is finally allowing, with certain restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The halftime show is new. It will originate from the ABC studios in New York, 
with Brent Musburger the host. He'll be joined by Peter King, Sports 
Illustrated football writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Williams Jr. is back, thankfully, so "Let's get ready for some football." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday night football: It has been fashionable among critics in recent years 
to knock Gary Bender, but under the influence of TNT partner Pat Haden and 
executive producer Don McGuire, he has become solid. 
</P>
<P>
 Haden is simply tremendous, blending humor and insight in perfect doses. 
</P>
<P>
 Haden, who has a new four-year contract with Turner Broadcasting, said he 
never considered going to Fox because he likes being TNT's main guy. 
</P>
<P>
 After TNT acquiesces to ESPN at the midway point of the season, Haden will 
switch to do games for CBS radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Haden also stays busy helping run the venture capital partnership of Riordan, 
Lewis and Haden. Former USC tennis star Chris Lewis and Haden pretty much run 
the company since their third partner, Richard Riordan, had to bow out after he 
became mayor of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add TNT: Lawrence Taylor, hired as an analyst on the network's "Stadium Show," 
talked with reporters on a conference call this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.T. on TNT," he said. "Sounds like a perfect marriage to me." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "One problem is you can't say the same words on television you say on the 
football field." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I'm trying this to see if I like it. I'll work hard to get better, and you 
never know, someday I might be another Frank Gifford." 
</P>
<P>
 At least he's not setting his goals too high. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pregame shows: Probably most fans Sunday morning at 9 will be watching the 
debut of Fox's Los Angeles-based NFL pregame show, with James Brown, Jimmy 
Johnson, Terry Bradshaw and Howie Long. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat forgotten is that NBC's "NFL Live," which this Sunday will be a 
one-hour show, has a new look. Greg Gumbel is now the host and will be joined 
in the studio by Ahmad Rashad, Joe Gibbs and Mike Ditka. Ditka is the only 
holdover from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Will McDonough will be used mostly as an on-site reporter, this week 
interviewing Bill Parcells. Jim Gray, who was at NBC before switching to CBS, 
is back at NBC and will be reporting news from around the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Said ESPN "NFL GameDay" host Chris Berman: "The first month you'll have a 
curiosity factor. If I was a fan, I'd be curious and look at all the shows. But 
then by Week 6 or 7, by mid-October, viewership should settle in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dishing it out: The NFL reports its "Sunday ticket" season packages for 
satellite dish owners have sold much better than expected, with about 130,000 
subscribers. Of those, about 5,200 are sports bars, which pay between $300 and 
$1,800 for the season, depending on seating capacity. The price for homeowners 
is $99.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Subscribers get all NFL telecasts, with two major exceptions -- no blacked-out 
home Ram or Raider games. 
</P>
<P>
 John Morris, founder and co-owner of the Legends chain, said the $1,800 price 
tag for his establishments is very reasonable. Morris also owns Mum's 
restaurant in Long Beach, which will begin showing NFL games as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't complain about the price," Morris said. "But my concern is policing 
my competitors so that they're not showing games without paying." TV-Radio 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN will commemorate its 15th anniversary Wednesday by having original 
anchors Chris Berman, Bob Ley and Tom Mees do the 8 p.m. edition of 
"SportsCenter." They last anchored "SportsCenter" together on Dec. 2, 1988. . . 
. Berman has put together a book of his nicknames. "ChrisNames" sells for 
$8.95, with a portion of the proceeds going to the V Foundation, named in honor 
of Jim Valvano, the former North Carolina State basketball coach who died of 
cancer. . . . ESPN's popular "Outside the Line" series Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. 
will focus on physically or mentally challenged athletes in a special entitled 
"Triumph of the Spirit." . . . On Wednesday at 6:30 p.m., ESPN will televise 
Bud Greenspan's outstanding 1970 documentary, "The Glory of Their Times," about 
baseball in better days. 
</P>
<P>
 What next for John McEnroe? During Wednesday's USA network coverage of the 
U.S. Open he stood on his head after promising to do so if Richard Krajicek 
lost a fourth-set tiebreaker after leading, 6-0. Krajicek lost it, and the next 
day McEnroe, while upside down, said, "No one can call me a liar now." . . . 
Now that his preseason television duties are over, Rich Marotta will be joining 
Jim Plunkett on KFI's Raider pregame shows. Monday's show begins at 4 p.m. . . 
. Channel 11's new postgame show, with Rick Garcia, Gary Apple and Jillian 
Warry, makes its debut Sunday after the Dallas-Pittsburgh game. . . . HBO's 
"Inside the NFL" makes its season debut Thursday at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC will televise a two-hour "NFL Kickoff '94" special Saturday at 1 p.m. Half 
of the show will consist of the first "NFL Run to Daylight," a competition 
among running backs similar to "NFL Quarterback Challenge." NBC had Thurman 
Thomas on last Saturday to promote it and he let it be known that Barry Sanders 
and Emmitt Smith didn't participate. Probably wasn't the kind of promo NBC had 
in mind. . . . Terry Bradshaw and the Northridge Little Leaguers will be on 
"The Tonight Show" Monday. . . . The Northridge team, back from the Little 
League World Series, visited KRTH-FM early Monday morning. The next day, disc 
jockey Robert W. Morgan complained that some television reports of the visit 
did not mention the radio station by name or the limo service that provided 
transportation. In what he called a "major media announcement," he banned NBC 
news, among others, from ever coming back on the station's lot. Wow, is NBC 
going to be able to survive that? 
</P>
<P>
 ABC has hired former New York Giant linebacker Harry Carson as a college 
football sideline reporter. He will join play-by-play announcer Steve Zabriskie 
and analyst John Spagnola at the Coliseum Saturday for the USC-Washington game, 
which begins at 12:30 p.m. . . . Keith Jackson, Bob Griese and sideline 
reporter Lynn Swann will work the 5 p.m. UCLA-Tennessee game at the Rose Bowl. 
An interview that ABC's John Saunders taped with Florida State Coach Bobby 
Bowden will be shown at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 A reminder: UCLA is no longer on KMPC. XTRA is now the Bruin station. Chris 
Roberts and David Norrie return, with nighttime talk show host Rick Schwartz, a 
UCLA graduate, joining them. . . . The Prime Ticket Pacific 10 game of the week 
Saturday at 7 p.m. is Oregon State vs. Arizona State. Phil Stone and former 
Stanford defensive back Rodney Gilmore call the action, with Paul Sunderland 
serving as the sideline reporter. . . . Prime Ticket will replay the 
UCLA-Tennessee game Sunday at 10:30 a.m., with Bill Macdonald and Tom Ramsey 
reporting, and USC-Washington Sunday at 10:45 p.m., with Tom Kelly and Craig 
Fertig.

FIELDS' FUMBLE RECOVERY HELPS WASHINGTON STATE BEAT ILLINOIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Washington State linebacker Mark Fields returned a fumble 71 yards for a 
touchdown late in the first half Thursday night as the Cougars held on to 
defeat No. 22 Illinois, 10-9, in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fighting Illini's, first game in Chicago in 55 years and first ever at 
Soldier Field attracted only 39,472 to the 66,950-seat stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of timeouts late in the game, Illinois moved from its 20 to the Washington 
State 34, but Bret Scheuplein missed on a 57-yard field-goal attempt as time 
ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 With 53 seconds left in the first half and the score tied, 3-3, Illinois 
linebacker Simeon Rice recovered a fumble by Washington State quarterback Chad 
Davis. Illinois tried to move into scoring position, but quarterback Johnny 
Johnson fumbled on second down after being hit. Fields scooped the ball up on 
the 29, sprinted down the sideline and dived into the end zone for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the longest fumble return in Washington State history, surpassing the 
70-yarder by Elmer Brown in 1899. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson came back to combine with Jasper Strong on a 52-yard completion, and a 
late-hit penalty gave the Illini a first down on the 10 with three seconds to 
go. Chris Richardson then kicked his second field goal of the half, a 28-yarder 
that made it 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson's third field goal of the game, a 43-yarder with 11:05 left in the 
third, cut the Cougars' lead to 10-9.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; SHAH WILL START IN SEASON OPENER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sharmon Shah will start at tailback for UCLA in its season opener Saturday at 
the Rose Bowl, "and will go as long as he can," Bruin Coach Terry Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 How long is that? 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as it takes," said Shah. "If the running game is going, we usually 
stick with it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how he got 40 carries for 187 yards at Stanford last year before going 
out for the season because of knee problems that earned him redshirt status. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have it down now," he said of a practice regimen that will allow 
him to play with chronic knee problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he can handle the load Saturday is open to question. UCLA will seek to 
test a new Tennessee defensive line, and Shah and backups Daron Washington and 
Shaun Williams will be called upon to do the testing, along with fullbacks 
James Milliner and Greg Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Derek Ayers will be tested in a light workout today, but Donahue 
said that he didn't expect Ayers back until next week, at the earliest. Ayers 
strained a knee ligament early in practice and has been sidelined since. . . . 
Troy Aldrich, who was moved from tight end to fullback in the spring, is out 
for the season because of a broken vertebra, and Donahue said Aldrich probably 
was through with football. 
</P>
<P>
 Injury report: tight end Jamal Clark probably will not play in Saturday's game 
because of knee problems. Linebacker Jeff Ruckman is sidelined because of a 
back strain. JIM HODGES

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; WOODS LOOKS WEST AT TROJAN CAREER

<TEXT>
<P>
 USC is in the hunt for one of the nation's top-rated high school quarterbacks, 
Quincy Woods of Park Forest, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, 6 feet 2 and 185 pounds, also is being recruited by Notre Dame but has 
narrowed his possible choices to Florida State, Nebraska, North Carolina and 
USC, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan quarterback Rob Johnson is a senior. The backups are sophomores Brad 
Otton and Matt Koffler. Junior Kyle Wachholtz is academically ineligible this 
year and has one season remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One NFL player personnel director, Bob Ackles of the Arizona Cardinals, rates 
two Trojans, quarterback Johnson and offensive tackle Tony Boselli, as 
potential first-round choices in the next draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a good year, there's no reason why Johnson shouldn't be a first-round 
pick," Ackles said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two other possible early quarterback picks, the way things stand now, would 
be Eric Zeier (of Georgia) and Steve McNair (of Alcorn State). 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnson's big pluses are his short-to-medium accuracy. His deep-ball accuracy 
isn't great yet, but it's good. His running ability is a negative, but a lot of 
good quarterbacks don't run well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boselli's pluses are obvious: Outstanding size (at 6-7 1/2 and 320), very 
quick set-up on pass blocking, poise."

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; ATTENDANCE BELIES RESCUE BID

<TEXT>
<P>
 The "Save the Rams" campaign does not appear to have caught on yet. 
</P>
<P>
 A club spokesman announced that 30,921 tickets have been sold for Sunday's 
opening game against the Arizona Cardinals at Anaheim Stadium, leaving more 
than 38,000 tickets available and a television blackout in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's attendance of 34,155 for a December game against the Cleveland 
Browns was the smallest crowd to watch the Rams in a non-strike game since 
their move to Anaheim, and the smallest since 1963, when the team drew 29,295 
at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ram spokesman said the NFL declined to assist in the search for negative 
attendance statistics, but a reporter's review of figures in NFL media guides 
dating to 1970 disclosed that the smallest crowd for an NFL home opener was 
32,607 at the New England Patriot-Miami Dolphin game in Harvard Stadium in 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals pinned selected quotes on a bulletin board in the team's locker 
room Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram running back Jerome Bettis was quoted as saying, "There is not a defense 
in football that can stop me, including the Cardinals. So far this season, they 
have talked a lot tougher than they've played." 
</P>
<P>
 The quote was read back to Bettis in the Ram locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who said that?" Bettis said. "That's the first time I've heard that." 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody knows Bettis is far more bland than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right," Bettis agreed. "You know that's not me. I never said anything 
like that." T.J. SIMERS

 Miami quarterback Dan Marino has accepted a restructured contract to help the 
team's bid for free agent cornerback Deion Sanders. The agreement doesn't 
represent a pay cut over the life of the contract, but an NFL source said 
nearly $1 million that Marino was to receive this year will be deferred until 
1995 and '96. 
</P>

 Quarterback Randall Cunningham and other Philadelphia Eagles have offered to 
postpone receiving part of their salaries so six teammates won't have to take 
30% pay cuts. "I'd be willing to defer some money to the future so guys 
wouldn't have to take pay cuts," Cunningham told the Philadelphia Inquirer, 
which said receiver Fred Barnett and others had made the same offer. . . . The 
Seattle Seahawks will play at least their first two games at Husky Stadium 
instead of in the Kingdome, which has been closed since July 19 because of 
ceiling problems. The Seahawks announced that the Sept. 18 game against San 
Diego and the Sept. 25 game against Pittsburgh will be played in the University 
of Washington stadium.

 After sitting out the final three exhibition games, defensive tackle Chester 
McGlockton will play Monday night in the Raiders' opener against the San 
Francisco 49ers at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton, the Raiders' No. 1 selection in the 1992 draft from Clemson, 
re-injured his right fibula against the Dallas Cowboys in the second exhibition 
game. 
</P>

 In the last two seasons, the Raiders are 17-9 when McGlockton plays, 1-7 when 
he doesn't.

 Safety Derrick Hoskins, who injured a knee in the final exhibition game 
against the Houston Oilers, practiced this week and also will play against the 
49ers, lining up mainly against tight end Brent Jones. 
</P>

 "The 49ers execute very well with conservative plays like slants and outs," 
Hoskins said. "The thing about (Jones) is that he's a good blocker who runs 
good routes, and they get him the ball a lot." LONNIE WHITE

SIDEKICKS GIVE SPLASH THE BOOT, 9-7; INDOOR SOCCER: DESPITE PLAYING WITHOUT 
FOUR STARTERS, ANAHEIM STICKS CLOSE TO CISL'S TOP TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Castro was disappointed but optimistic. And his mood reflected that of 
every other Splash player who managed to gimp through Thursday night's loss to 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The first words from Castro's mouth following the defeat? "I think we got the 
edge." 
</P>
<P>
 His second? "The reason they beat us tonight was because we lacked 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Two points that seemed to hit the Splash's championship hopes on the head. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sidekicks, the team with the best record in the CISL, scored a 9-7 victory 
over the Splash in front of a franchise record 7,114 at The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 David Doyle and Eric Dade scored fourth-quarter goals, saddling the Splash 
with only its second home loss of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The matchup was a preview of what many believe will be the championship 
series. Dallas, Eastern Division champion and winner of seven consecutive 
games, is 23-3; the Splash, Western Division champion, is 19-8 and has the 
second-best record in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the victory gave Dallas a series sweep of the Splash, there were some 
extenuating circumstances -- such as the four starters and six regulars missing 
from the Splash lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash played with 40% of its total point-scorers sitting in the club 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
 Raffaele Ruotolo (66 points, out with toe injury), Armando Valdivia (30, 
knee), Ralph Black (34, suspension) and Denis Hamlett (18, ankle) represented 
three of the top five and four of the top nine point scorers on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Also missing were two defensive-minded midfielders, Mike LaPosha (knee) and 
Jaime Francisco (hamstring). 
</P>
<P>
 That left the Splash with only four players with as many as three years of 
professional indoor soccer experience. But the Splash still came close to 
beating the Sidekicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a good team," said Dale Ervine, who had two goals, "but they're not a 
team we have to fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas' 9-6 victory in July had gnawed at Splash players for the 1 1/2 months. 
"We played terrible," Splash defender Doug Neely said before Thursday's 
rematch. "We want to redeem ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 They did. In theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This built our confidence up a lot even though we lost," goalkeeper Jorge 
Valenzuela said. "It's great when guys who have barely seen the field come out 
and perform like that." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Splash led by two goals at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas led, 3-1, before a second-quarter blitz by the Splash's baby brigade. 
Bobby Reyes scored his second goal of the season; Paul Ratcliffe scored his 
13th; Steve McKenzie scored his second; and then Dale Ervine scored his 
team-high 38th to give the Splash a 5-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash's first goal came off the left foot of Bobby Bruch, who scored his 
first professional goal Sunday in overtime against Sacramento to clinch the 
Western Division title. It tied the score, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys are disappointed -- deep down, they feel we gave this game away," 
Splash Coach George Fernandez said. "I have to be happy about sticking with the 
best team in the league with our young players . . . I feel sorry for Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona plays the Splash Saturday at The Pond in the final game of the regular 
season. The Splash will play host to Sacramento in a playoff game Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro (28 goals) gave the Splash a 6-5 lead, but Dallas tied it 44 seconds 
later. Ervine scored his 39th goal to tie the score, 7-7, going into the fourth 
quarter.

 Marina overwhelmed Honolulu Damien, 34-0, Thursday night in the Shawn Akina 
Prep Football Classic before 5,000 at Aloha Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Williams scored three touchdowns and rushed for 205 yards in the first 
three quarters to help the Vikings to their commanding lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who had 178 yards rushing in the first half, started the scoring 
with a nine-yard run four seconds into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Micah Harrison caught a 10-yard pass from Matthew Roberson with 7 minutes 37 
seconds left in the half and Joseph Borzoni ran in the conversion after a fake 
kick to make it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams scored his second touchdown on a 78-yard run with 3:27 left in the 
half. He also scored on a one-yard burst with 8:39 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings started out shakily, receiving 100 yards in first-half penalties. 
But they sacked Damien's Scott Hicks three times and recovered two fumbles to 
frustrated the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 Damien played without 10 players who had suspended for a breach of school 
discipline. Among the suspended players were three 1993 Interscholastic League 
of Honolulu all-stars, including 6-foot-0, 260-pound defensive tackle Inoke 
Breckterfield, 6-1, 235-pound offensive lineman Max Mahoney and running back 
Inoa Rodenhurst. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Damien players involved in what the school called a "serious breach 
of discipline" were expelled. PAT BIGOLD

<P>
 Trainer Brian Mayberry was suspended for 30 days by the California Horse 
Racing Board Thursday because of what CHRB stewards at Del Mar said was a 
positive drug test on a horse he ran at Hollywood Park on July 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling said that Gamblin A.J., trained by Mayberry at the time, was found 
with a foreign substance -- promazine sulfoxide -- in his urine after the sixth 
race that day.Steward Dave Samuel described promazine sulfoxide as a 
tranquilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamblin A.J. was claimed by trainer Mike Mitchell out of that Hollywood Park 
field and is scheduled to run in Saturday's Del Mar Debutante out of the 
Mitchell barn. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the terms of the suspension, Mayberry loses his license 
privileges and is denied access to all premises within the CHRB's jurisdiction. 
The 30-day period will begin next Tuesday.

 Thursday's feature race was won by Soul Of The Matter, making its first start 
since finishing fifth in the Kentucky Derby. DAVE DISTEL

SONIER MAKES COMMITMENT TO BULLFROGS; ROLLER HOCKEY: HIS DECISION TO LEAVE ICE 
HOCKEY AND COACH HERE FULL-TIME IS BOON TO ANAHEIM FRANCHISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Most of the Bullfrogs won't have time to dwell on their elimination from the 
Roller Hockey International playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
 With NHL and minor-league camps opening this weekend, it's back to their 
primary careers as ice hockey players. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bullfrog Coach Grant Sonier will have all autumn, winter, and spring to 
ponder why Anaheim couldn't win back-to-back championships. Coaching the 
Bullfrogs is now a full-time job for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners Maury Silver and his sons, Nelson and Stuart, hired Sonier to run the 
team's hockey operations year-round. Sonier resigned last month from his job 
with the Sarnia Sting of the Ontario Hockey League, regarded as one of the 
world's best junior developmental leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonier's hiring reflects the Bullfrogs' continued commitment to the fledgling 
league, in only its second season.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 1.1 million fans attended 264 regular-season games, and increased 
parity, attendance and television exposure this season were all positive signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was ahead of the game in ice hockey, trying to climb the ladder in 
coaching, so I resigned with a degree of sadness," Sonier said. "But I've 
closed that door because I really believe in roller hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonier, 29, received an "open-ended contract," he said, and will also work 
with the league office.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 RHI season came to an unexpected and abrupt end for Sonier. Portland 
out-skated, outshot and outplayed the Bullfrogs, posting two consecutive 
victories this week. The Rage conclude the RHI Championship series against 
Buffalo tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if Portland was that much more skilled than us," Sonier said. 
"But they had better team speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there was a part of our team that was emotionally drained, almost like 
we accomplished our championship by beating Los Angeles in the Pacific Division 
final. Then, there was a mental letdown on our part in the next round, and 
maybe we underestimated Portland. We had our hands full, and in a short series, 
anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainty was something lacking in RHI's inaugural season, when the 
Bullfrogs won 17 of 18 games and cruised to the league championship.  
</P>
<P>
 The RHI's expansion from 12 to 24 teams brought more parity, but the Bullfrog 
formula remained constant. They kept a championship coach -- Sonier was an 
assistant to Anaheim Coach Chris McSorley last season -- and 10 of 17 players 
returned from last season's championship squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the best fans in the league," Sonier said. Anaheim proved it by 
leading the league in attendance for the second time, drawing an average of 
9,885 in 14 games.  
</P>
<P>
 And although the Bullfrogs had a good season, they know a championship is the 
only thing that will truly appease their owners, players and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year, we will have to be bigger and faster," Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several current and former Bullfrogs have impressed ice-hockey officials and 
will probably play in the American or International Hockey leagues, the top 
minor leagues, this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Langdon, a bruising, 6-foot-1, 205-pound forward, will attend the New 
York Rangers' camp, but could start the season with Binghamton of the AHL. 
Langdon, 23, had only three regular-season goals for the Bullfrogs but had 10 
points in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-2, 210, Barry Potomski, a 21-year-old forward who played with Anaheim in 
1993, will also go to NHL camp after signing as a free agent with the Kings.  
</P>
<P>
 Victor Gervais has a three-year contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins' IHL 
affiliate in Cleveland. Gervais, 25, led the Bullfrogs in scoring for the 
second consecutive season and scored 12 goals in six playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Jim Brown, 21, has signed with Portland, the Washington Capitals' AHL 
affiliate, and defenseman Yuri Krivokhija, 26, will probably play with 
Cincinnati, the Florida Panthers' IHL affiliate, Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the Bullfrogs will return to the East Coast or Colonial 
Hockey leagues except Darren Perkins, Christian Lalonde, Ken Murchison and Joe 
Cook, who will stay with the Bullfrogs during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might stay to work with our youth camps and do promotional stuff," 
Sonier said. "They've played enough hockey to know they're probably not going 
to make it to the next level." 
</P>
<P>
 Bullfrog forward and assistant coach Brad McCaughey also will stay with Sonier 
in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brad's retired from ice hockey, and I think, for the most part, he's hanging 
up the roller blades, too," Sonier said. "He has a great future in coaching and 
management." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fans looking for RHI stars with NHL potential, here are some of Sonier's 
picks: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Craig Charron, 26, Blades forward. Charron, who scored 34 goals in 19 RHI 
games, is still unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Max Mikhailovsky, 25, Blades goalie. The RHI most valuable player has 
signed with Detroit of the IHL. The only Blades player to receive an NHL camp 
invitation was Mike Doers, who will try out with the San Jose Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vadim Slivchenko, 24, Portland forward. Slivchenko was a 1994 ECHL all star 
and had 61 points in 26 RHI games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gervais and Krivokhija. "Victor's shown he can play at the IHL level, and 
now he's got a full season ahead of him to prove he can get to the next level," 
Sonier said. "Last season, Yuri came on strong in the IHL, scoring 40-plus 
points in 40 games at Milwaukee."

COMING BACK TO EARTH; LITTLE LEAGUE: REALITY SLOWLY SETS IN FOR NORTHRIDGE 
ENTOURAGE AFTER THRILL-PACKED RUN TO WORLD SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The road to Williamsport, Pa., was clearly marked for the Northridge Little 
League team. 
</P>
<P>
 Destination: World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The road home has been one long parade, a whirlwind of accolades after the 
team won the United States championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet precisely what awaits the team is much less clear. And far less glamorous. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland, Magic Mountain and Universal Studios were stops this week for the 
players. Jay Leno greets them Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the amusement park rides and talk show appearances end, a group of 
11- and 12-year-old boys who captured the hearts of a nation will be left to 
begin junior high school and cope with creeping adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 Their accomplishments will be old news, yet their lives are only beginning. 
The Long Beach Little League team that won World Series championships in 1992 
and '93 is something of ancient history -- and those players are just starting 
high school.  
</P>
<P>
 "The adjustment has been easier for some than for others," said Jeff 
Burroughs, the Long Beach coach. "It's hard to tell with kids, but I think most 
of them knew in the back of their minds that the attention wouldn't last." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns more pressing than the fading flame of fame face the Northridge 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 They racked up enormous credit card bills paying their way up and down that 
joyful road to Williamsport, Pa. They returned to homes still damaged from the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, damage recounted in colorful detail last week by the 
national media, but damage no closer to repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll all get back to normal eventually, but nobody wants to think about that 
now," said Greg Frost, father of outfielder Michael Frost, as the team was 
being honored Monday at the Northridge Little League complex. 
</P>
<P>
 For some families, reality has already nibbled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our telephone service had been turned off when we got home," said Lynn 
Wallis, mother of third baseman Gregg. "Two weeks away, and this. I can't 
believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not until the attention shuts off -- and it will, like a light switch -- do 
the players begin life after Little League. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideas of what even the immediate future holds are hazy at best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just taking this as it comes," Michael Frost said. "I really haven't 
thought much about school, or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The pleasant surprises keep coming. Matt Cunningham, who played catcher, 
center field and pitcher, was approached Monday by an elderly man who 
introduced himself as Dick Bank, a former major league scout. "I came out here 
to shake your hand, son, and tell you I believe you will be in the big leagues 
some day," Bank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the players ooze talent. Yet the game they played better than any team 
in the nation will offer new challenges. All but the two 11-year-olds will move 
up to Junior League, played under regular baseball rules on a field close to 
regulation size. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodby field of dreams. The Northridge Junior League facility is a field of 
bumps and bad hops, a parched patch of dirt and grass nicknamed The Sandlot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to it, it'll be fun," said Justin Gentile, who pitched 
the World Series final. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile and other pitchers have much to learn, such as holding runners close 
to bases properly. Catchers must throw out base stealers, fielders must 
position themselves differently with runners on base, batters must learn the 
hit-and-run play. And everyone must learn to lead off and steal bases. 
</P>
<P>
 That part -- learning the game -- will be fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Less enjoyable will be the inevitable needling -- "This isn't Little League 
anymore" -- by people motivated by envy. Chris Drury, who pitched the Little 
League World Series championship game five years ago for Trumbull, Conn., said 
those comments grew tiresome. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just jealous," he told Sport Illustrated. "Most guys would trade 
their right arm to have a chance to do what we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Drury is an example of how dramatically goals can change. He no longer plays 
organized baseball but will attend Boston University this fall on a hockey 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trumbull team held a five-year reunion recently, something City Councilman 
Hal Bernson urged the Northridge players to do when he congratulated them 
Monday at the Northridge field complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Another speaker, Seattle Mariner infielder Torey Lovullo, offered advice that 
the players might well hold dear as they close the book on Little League. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you pursue everything in life with the passion and intensity you showed 
during this tournament, you will be successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The players listened intently, and when the ceremony was completed they were 
besieged once again by reporters and autograph seekers. The bubble had yet to 
burst.

COMFORTABLE PLACE TO LAND; DELMATOFF LEFT PIERCE FOR VALLEY BECAUSE OF 
RUN-AND-SHOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the rumor mongers get overly excited, quarterback Davis Delmatoff wants 
to set the record straight about his move this season from Pierce College to 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pierce players and coaches are good people," said Delmatoff, a former 
Hart High standout. "It wasn't anything they did or that happened there that 
made me come to Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough. 
</P>
<P>
 But few players who are as productive as Delmatoff (1,961 yards passing and 
nine touchdowns in '93) jump ship without reason. There has to be a hidden 
agenda, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Nice try but no touchdown, said Delmatoff. Not even a field goal. The decision 
was purely logical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to be back with an offense I was more comfortable with," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley, that offense is the run-and-shoot. It's what Delmatoff executed 
with great precision at Hart when he passed for 3,196 yards and 36 touchdowns 
in his senior season in 1992. And although he adjusted well to the spread 
offense with four wide receivers used by Pierce, Delmatoff wanted to work in a 
more familiar environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I already know how to make the reads (against the run-and-shoot)," Delmatoff 
said. "I know how certain defenses tend to react against that kind of an 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Delmatoff, 6 feet and 220 pounds, actually had hoped to prove that at Valley 
last year. He enrolled at the Van Nuys school after graduating from Hart and 
practiced with the Monarchs, but just before the season started he moved to 
Pierce. Even now, Delmatoff can't pinpoint what prompted last year's switch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an uneasy feeling. I could never really put my finger on it," 
Delmatoff said. "I just didn't feel comfortable at Valley at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps some of that apprehension was caused by Sean Fitzgerald. The 6-5 
rifle-armed quarterback set a school single-season passing mark with 3,134 
yards last year and led the Monarchs (9-2) to a 21-19 last-second victory over 
Moorpark in the Western State K-Swiss Bowl. One glance at Fitzgerald in 
practice might have prompted Delmatoff to try his luck elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had Sean Fitzgerald working with us and Davis didn't want to take a chance 
of not playing," said Jim Fenwick, the Valley coach. "We were disappointed 
(Delmatoff left) and it left us with one quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 That cleat is now on the other foot. 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 games at Pierce, Delmatoff hit the mark 174 times in 339 attempts 
(51.3%) and averaged 11.3 yards per completion. He was one of the bright spots 
for the Brahmas, who finished 5-5 overall and 2-3 in the South Division of the 
Western State Conference. With Delmatoff calling the signals, Coach Bill Norton 
knew he had a reliable and proven player at the position. 
</P>
<P>
 But his defection to Valley soon after the season left Norton with a hole to 
fill. The move didn't surprise him but he wasn't thrilled with the way 
Delmatoff handled it, Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason I was really upset about the deal is that Davis wasn't man 
enough to tell me," Norton said. "He had his dad call me. I believe his 
explanation about the run-and-shoot and I don't have any hard feelings. I wish 
him luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Delmatoff will need that, if only because he has a tough act to follow. 
Fitzgerald recently won the starting job at Pittsburgh and his shadow looms 
large over Monarch Stadium. There will be comparisons and Delmatoff will have 
the added pressure of trying to direct an inexperienced offense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Delmatoff doesn't anticipate problems. He faced similar expectations at 
Hart when he replaced Ryan Connors, who passed for 4,144 yards in 1991, and 
Delmatoff, who played wide receiver the year before, responded brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of used to filling big shoes," Delmatoff said. "Sean is a great 
quarterback and he broke records, but I can't go out there and try to 
accomplish what he did. It wouldn't be smart to go into the season thinking 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially not when he still is battling for the starting job with Jim 
Arellanes, a transfer from Northern Arizona. At 6-4 and 210, he's a Fitzgerald 
clone. Arellanes completed 13 of 19 attempts for 160 yards and two touchdowns 
in a backup role for the Lumberjacks last season, but he could win the job at 
Valley because of his size and strong arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Delmatoff, conversely, apparently faces the stigma of being too short to play 
quarterback in a Division I program. He did not receive much interest from 
major four-year schools after high school, but Fenwick intends to help 
Delmatoff get noticed this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not the prototype of a quarterback that Sean or that Jim are," Fenwick 
said. "In some respects, they have somewhat of a recruiting advantage. A guy 
like Davis is going to have to prove himself all the time. But he is a good 
football player. He throws a very catchable ball and has a real good sense for 
timing." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly when it comes to switching teams, Delmatoff hopes.

MAJOR CHANGES IN THE MINORS; STRICTLY AN INDEPENDENT VENTURE; BASEBALL: PLANNED 
LOWER-LEVEL PRO CIRCUIT WOULD BE BASED IN VALLEY.

 Bob Weinstein handed the waiter $20 to settle the bar tab. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiter didn't move and stared blankly at the bill. Several seconds passed, 
making Weinstein wonder whether he'd short-changed the guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's not enough, there's more where that came from," Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 With major league owners bleating about the paucity of cash in their wallets 
and the wad of bills lining players' pockets, Weinstein may qualify as an 
anomaly. He wants to throw money around. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein, 51, is one of a growing band of renegades involved in the 
organization of independent professional minor leagues, self-funded 
organizations that are turning up at a remarkable pace across the national 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein, an investment banker from Chatsworth, says he has lined up $50 
million to bankroll the proposed Golden State League of Professional Baseball. 
Revolutions need a leader, and Weinstein fronts the area rebel charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conventional baseball wisdom is what we're opposed to," Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley-based GSL might one day include teams as near as the Antelope 
Valley and as far north as Chico. Teams, which will compete at roughly the 
Class-A level, will battle for the same baseball buck with established major- 
and minor-league teams in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 This is hardly untrod ground. The GSL is but one of nine independent leagues 
that already are operational or planning to begin play next summer. Something 
is in the wind. Weinstein hopes it is change. 
</P>
<P>
 The GSL is exploring the possibility of positioning teams in Palmdale, Vista, 
Brawley, Merced, Indio and an unspecified site in San Luis Obispo County. If 
everything falls into place, and the clock is ticking, the GSL next summer will 
play a short-season schedule of 90 games with six teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein has spent the past few months pressing palms with city dignitaries 
throughout the state, researching other independent leagues and comparing notes 
with officials in the affiliated professional ranks. Last week, the league 
signed a letter of intent to begin formal negotiations with Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein says he has secured the league nest egg through private investment 
and banking contacts he has declined to enumerate. Peter Futro, a securities 
attorney in Denver who has been retained to work out the details of Weinstein's 
financial plan, said the league must first sign letters of intent with 
advertisers and cities before investment banking firms will jump on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Futro said it's "premature to say that Weinstein has commitments" for $50 
million, but indicated that matters could move swiftly toward that end in light 
of developments in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assuming it all falls together, which it should, the numbers make sense," 
Futro said. "But you can't really crunch the numbers until the cities and ad 
revenue are there." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein may need each thin dime -- the league is footing the bill for darn 
near everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm covering all bets," he said. "It's gonna happen. I'm a doer and I'm also 
a realist." 
</P>
<P>
 A sobering dose of reality for area fans: Over the past 40 years, the region 
has had a minor-league team for precisely one season. The Ventura Gulls played 
in 1986, then relocated. Channel Cities, a team in Northern Ventura County, 
completed a two-year run at the Class C level in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein has studied the numbers, made his projections and done his homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken on a mind, body and life of its own," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Players, of course, are the body and soul of any league. The league plans to 
fill its ranks with a draft, tryout camps and through references from scouts 
and college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Wiencek, formerly a player, scout and minor-league general manager, will 
serve as the GSL's director of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't subscribe to the theory that there are tons of (high-caliber) 
unsigned players, but there are players out there," Wiencek said. 
</P>
<P>
 The league will seek players between the ages of 18-25. Teams will have a 
25-man roster and a salary cap of $30,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, Weinstein would love to duplicate the success of the 
Minnesota-based Northern League, which began play last summer. Attendance 
averaged approximately 3,300 per game in its inaugural season. Weinstein called 
to solicit advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Run it with an iron fist and do it right,' " Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd like to begin doing so right now . But in such a far-flung venture, there 
are always a few zillion details to firm up. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the sweeping GSL plans, six stadiums will be built and financed 
by the league at $5 million apiece, including the proposed facility in the 
Antelope Valley. Weinstein said stadiums will have seating for a minimum of 
4,500 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Boyd of Tampa-based Lescher & Mahoney Sports Architects, the firm 
contracted to design the stadiums, said construction can be completed in six 
months, providing the weather cooperates. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein will own and operate the Antelope Valley franchise and already has 
selected a logo and nickname, the Ravens. He will hire officials to run the 
remaining teams, also to be operated at league expense. 
</P>
<P>
 If the GSL franchises do well, Weinstein said he plans to eventually sell off 
teams at the prevailing market price while retaining stadium ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the GSL plans to fund the teams, draft the players, build the 
stadiums. . . So what's the hang-up for potential host cities? 
</P>
<P>
 Cities must donate 25 acres of land as a stadium site, expedite the building 
permit process and provide infrastructure such as electrical and sewer hookups. 
Even Palmdale, which last month acquired a 117-acre parcel of land -- part of 
which has been tentatively designated for the Ravens' stadium -- can hardly 
believe the GSL sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd really like to have a team here," Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford said. "(The 
GSL proposal is) almost too good to be true." 
</P>
<P>
 With success seemingly close at hand in Palmdale, the league is close to 
gaining a foothold. According to the terms of the letter of intent signed last 
Friday with Palmdale, Weinstein has 90 days to prove that his financial house 
is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially: Put up or shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 It has taken months for the GSL to reach this point. There have been 
innumerable setbacks and complications. Several cities have been involved in 
negotiations, yet progress has been slow and time is ticking away. Said 
Weinstein, eight long months ago: "The next move is to start turning dirt and 
taking pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see why Weinstein covets the Antelope Valley as a potential site. 
According to Steve Dukett, Lancaster's director of economic development, the 
results of a feasibility study conducted by an independent firm four years ago 
indicated that a minor-league team in the region would enjoy "enormous 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any doubt we'd support (a team)," said Al McCord, 
Palmdale's director of economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 They'd better. Joe Gagliardi, president of the Class-A California League, says 
that without the infusion of capital from organizational agreements, 
independent franchises could struggle financially. Eight of 10 teams in the Cal 
League, founded in 1941, have player-development contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have a very difficult time if I had all independents," Gagliardi said. 
"If it's tough for us with working agreements to make it work. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The independents' reasoning must have some merit, though, because leagues are 
sprouting everywhere. They are a stripped-down version of their affiliated 
counterparts and might be the future of lower-level baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Independents could save big-league owners a fortune. Instead of paying an 
estimated $500,000 in developmental agreements annually for a full-season 
Class-A team, owners fork out a few thousand dollars and pay a scout to pluck 
top prospects from the independent ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 There could be plenty of players to eyeball. Other independent leagues that 
have begun play or are on tap for 1995 are the Northern, Frontier, 
Texas-Louisiana, Northeast, Western, Great Central, Mid-South and North 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
 But what thrives in Corpus Christi (Texas-Louisiana League) might not play as 
well elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is California, we're different," Gagliardi said. "Just in expenses and 
overhead, we're different. Plus, there are more things to do here, like going 
to the beach, the mountains. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal League averaged 2,200 fans per game in '93, led by Rancho Cucamonga, 
which averaged a 4,900 at its new ballpark. San Bernardino, a Cal League 
independent, averaged 1,300. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the Golden State League become Weinstein's golden goose? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not altruistic," Weinstein said. "I'm out to make money. But I also love 
baseball, and fortunately, I'm in a position where I can make this work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gonna happen, and probably bigger and better than I ever envisioned." 
Independents Day 
</P>
<P>
 FRI.: The Golden State League, the brainchild of Chatsworth investment banker 
Bob Weinstein, is exploring the possibility of positioning teams in Palmdale, 
Vista, Brawley, Merced, Indio and an unspecified site in San Luis Obispo 
County. If everything falls into place, the leagues might begin a six-team, 
90-game schedule as soon as next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 SAT.: Miles Wolff, who formerly published Baseball America magazine, last 
summer founded the first independent league -- the highly successful Northern 
League. Attendance boomed and others took notice. Next summer, as many as nine 
independent leagues could be in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 SUN.: Independent leagues serve as a last chance for career minor leaguers and 
major league castoffs. One of the top hitters for the Sioux Falls (S.D.) 
Canaries of the Northern League is former Dodger Pedro Guerrero. Life at this 
rung in professional baseball is often unpredictable and humbling. Players are 
actually traded for bats and balls.

PREP FOOTBALL '94 / GOLDEN WEST LEAGUE; LOSING STREAK DOESN'T GET DONNELLY 
DOWN; FOOTBALL: OCEAN VIEW COACH SAYS THINGS ARE STARTING TO COME TOGETHER WITH 
HIS TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Donnelly is walking, talking, observing, gesturing. Donnelly is coaching, 
which in itself is not news because Ocean View High pays him to do this. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is Donnelly's seemingly boundless energy on the football field 
something to turn heads. Enthusiasm is an unwritten prerequisite for coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 What is eye-opening, however, is that Donnelly's approach remains constant 
despite a losing streak spanning 29 games, players who wanted to be anywhere 
but at practice and the questions you would expect to bombard a coach whose 
team last won during the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy? Who could blame Donnelly if he begged for some time off -- like 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to say it has been easy, because it hasn't," Donnelly said. "It 
has been quite a struggle and real stressful at times. But I really believe it 
has all been worth it because, honestly, I think things are coming together." 
</P>
<P>
 After three seasons as the Sunset League's doormat, Ocean View enters the 
Golden West League's inaugural season with hope. And while Donnelly, in his 
second year as coach, admits the Seahawks won't win a league championship 
anytime soon, he says a positive attitude has permeated the team and will lead 
to victories this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids worked hard in the off-season; a lot of learning went on in the 
summer," Donnelly said. "We really think good things are going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The slightest improvement would be trumpeted. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 14, 1991, Ocean View defeated Saddleback, 13-7, in a season opener. 
No one could have imagined that lackluster victory would become one of the 
team's highlights of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks have been outscored, 877-227, for an average of 30.2-7.8 during 
the streak. Ocean View also has lost 20 consecutive league games. 
</P>
<P>
 Although never an Orange County football power, Ocean View has experienced 
success. The Seahawks shared the Sunset League title in 1989 and had a winning 
record (5-4-1) in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say exactly," Donnelly said. "It was a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
 As the losing streak grew, so did apathy for football at Ocean View. Some 
players came to practice infrequently, and many of those who did show pointed 
fingers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Not to knock anybody, but the kids didn't get a lot of discipline before," 
Donnelly said. "A lot of the kids weren't in the best condition in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not letting them make excuses any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Donnelly, 29, coached the offensive and defensive lines when the hard times 
hit in 1991. He became head coach last season when the streak increased from 19 
to its current mark. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1983 graduate of Ocean View, Donnelly moved quickly to remove the "loser" 
tag synonymous with the team. He met with players often during the first few 
months after his hiring, trying to instill confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't pay off in victories last season, but Donnelly said progress was 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were going to win a few last year, but we made a lot of 
improvements," Donnelly said. "We're a lot farther ahead this year than last." 
</P>
<P>
 His charges concur. 
</P>
<P>
 "In previous years we always thought about the losing, but we're not even 
thinking about that now," said senior offensive lineman Nathan Traxler, in his 
third season on the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overall attitude has been great. We're looking for the win and we think 
it's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior running back Calvin Silva, also a three-year varsity player, said team 
unity is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go to the movies together; we have beach parties together," Silva said. 
"We never went out during previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past we weren't as one." 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View's administration and booster club have been supportive of 
Donnelly's approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real hard to play when we didn't get support from the school," Traxler 
said. "But that started to change last year. A lot of parents and kids came out 
last year even though we didn't win." 
</P>
<P>
 Donnelly hopes to build on the positive trend and give the fans something to 
cheer about -- finally . 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been waiting for this season to come for a long time," he said. "It's 
all been building up to this. The feeling is there's no place to go but up."

KINGS REWARD KURRI WITH TWO-YEAR PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Right wing Jari Kurri, one of the few Kings who did not have a disappointing 
showing last season, agreed to a new contract Thursday and will receive a 
sizable raise. 
</P>
<P>
 It is two-year deal, the second year an option year. Figures were not 
disclosed, but the contract is in the neighborhood of $4 million. It is said to 
be similar to the one signed last week by Washington's Joe Juneau, who has a 
four-year deal worth $8.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurri, 34, made $1 million last season. He had 31 goals and 46 assists and was 
the Kings' third-leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Kings are expected to announce today that they have signed 
free-agent forwards Dan Quinn and Troy Crowder, according to league sources. 
King General Manager Sam McMaster was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old Quinn, once a 40-goal scorer in Pittsburgh, has a 
controversial past. While with the Minnesota North Stars, he was arrested in 
November of 1992 after a 19-year-old woman alleged that he had raped her. 
Authorities later declined to charge him, saying they would be unable to prove 
the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt. The North Stars released him for a 
curfew violation the night of the alleged incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Quinn played in Europe, then joined the Ottawa Senators for their 
final 13 games, scoring seven goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowder, 26, has been out of hockey since the 1991-92 season because of a back 
injury. The 6-4, 220-pounder is known for his fighting ability, recording 182 
penalty minutes in 59 games with New Jersey in the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings also reached agreements with left wings Mike Donnelly and Keith 
Redmond, and centers Pat Conacher and Robert Lang. Donnelly signed a three-year 
deal -- two years plus an option -- averaging about $725,000 a season. Donnelly 
had 21 goals and 42 points last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Conacher, 35, is coming off a strong season in which he scored 15 goals and 28 
points. He signed a two-year contract -- one year plus an option -- worth about 
$850,000. Lang, who scored 19 points in 32 games last season, signed a two-year 
contract, one year plus an option, as did Redmond. LISA DILLMAN

PADILLA'S RETIREMENT EXPECTED OVER CLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zack Padilla, the Azusa-based junior-welterweight finally beginning to taste 
the financial rewards of championship-level boxing, has been told he has a 
small blood clot near his brain and apparently is ready to retire from the 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla, the World Boxing Organization champion, was taken to a hospital 
Tuesday after suffering a dizzy spell during a sparring session with Shane 
Mosley. 
</P>
<P>
 Richie Sandoval, the former world bantamweight champion and current employee 
of Padilla's promoter, Top Rank, Inc., talked to Padilla on Thursday and said 
the 31-year-old fighter is at home and taking the diagnosis seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval said that Padilla, known for his blue-collar, swarming fight style 
before and after his three-year sabbatical in 1987-90, admitted that he had 
been experiencing continuous, severe headaches since his July 24 technical 
knockout of Juan LaPorte.  
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Top Rank said the company would not comment on the matter 
until it knew all the details, but that Padilla's scheduled title defense on an 
Oct. 22 card in Hong Kong obviously will be canceled. TIM KAWAKAMI

OFFICIALS CONFLICT ON 9 DRUG TESTS; OLYMPICS: FORMER MEDICAL OFFICER DISPUTES 
DE MERODE'S CONTENTION THAT 1984 DOCUMENTS WERE HASTILY SHREDDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Questions concerning nine positive drug tests that mysteriously disappeared at 
the end of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics remained unanswered despite this 
week's explanation by the chairman of the International Olympic Committee's 
medical commission that it was an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince Alexandre de Merode, in Paris for the IOC's Centennial Olympic 
Congress, told reporters that the L.A. Olympic Organizing Committee shredded 
the records in its haste to close operations. He attributed the account to Tony 
Daly, the organizing committee's chief medical officer who is the Clippers' 
team physician. 
</P>
<P>
 De Merode was responding to reports that the documents from the last two days 
of the Games were stolen from his office at the Biltmore Hotel and then 
destroyed before testing procedures were completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, who last week told The Times he did not know about the nine positive 
tests, contradicted De Merode's explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would never take his records, and we didn't even have shredders," Daly 
said this week. "I don't know where he came up with that. I never said anything 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The organizing committee did use shredders to destroy the mounds of paperwork 
it generated from the '84 Games, but Daly said he was unaware of how those 
documents were discarded. The local organizing committee usually would not have 
access to IOC material. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're his records," Daly said of drug tests. "(De Merode is) the only one 
who gets it. Then he's saying that we took his records and shredded them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, who was chief medical officer for soccer's World Cup '94, was surprised 
that De Merode blamed him for the mishap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe (because) I'm completely out of the Olympic movement and I haven't 
talked to him for 10 years," said Daly, who speculated that De Merode simply 
lost the data. 
</P>
<P>
 Under IOC protocol, data for positive "A" samples were sent by the UCLA 
drug-testing facility to De Merode, who notified the federations of the 
athletes involved. Federation officials were then supposed to notify the 
athletes and coaches. The athletes or their representatives were allowed to 
witness the testing of a "B" sample to confirm the positive result. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA officials said the laboratory was never asked to test "B" samples for the 
nine positive tests. That has sparked a controversy as to what happened to test 
results of the "A" samples. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think there is a cover-up," Daly said. "Why would they want to 
do it? De Merode is the only one who knew. I could be wrong, but I think he 
somehow lost the records in a hurry to get out of there and he had no idea 
where they were. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they were destroyed, but I didn't destroy them, nor did anybody. . . . 
Well, I can't say that, but I know personally I never destroyed them."

A LEAGUE OF HIS VERY OWN; BASEBALL: BOB WEINSTEIN SAYS HE WILL MAKE HIS IDEA A 
REALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The kid unloaded his best fastball. Pure left-handed heat, the best he could 
muster. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Weinstein's mom caught the ball with a flick of her glove and tossed it 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the driveway between two homes in Brooklyn, N.Y., Pearl Weinstein 
taught her young son about the duality of baseball and growing up. Pearls of 
wisdom, if you will. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same lady who taught me to play baseball taught me not to quit," said 
Weinstein, an investment banker from Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be ashamed if I failed without having tried. As long as I tried, I'll 
never be ashamed if it doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein's work in progress is the independent Golden State League of 
Professional Baseball, a proposed Valley-based minor league he hopes will begin 
play in six California cities next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein, 51, could have bailed out on the plan a dozen times over the past 
few months, which have been filled with delays and disappointment. But 
Weinstein doesn't roll over easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's irrepressible," said Jack Rudofsky, an attorney who lives in Weinstein's 
neighborhood. "The guy's chock full of energy. He's got a bad back and a bad 
leg, but he's a dynamo." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein, at 5-foot-10, is slight of build and doesn't much look like a mover 
and shaker. An auto accident 34 years ago has made walking a less-than-fluid 
affair. A two-pack-a-day smoking habit, since kicked, contributed to a 
near-fatal heart attack three years ago. He doesn't have much hair left, 
either, but has youthful enthusiasm by the bushel. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll likely need it -- plus a healthy sense of humor and a thick skin -- to 
get the sluggish project off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The seed for this self-possessed project was planted 10 years ago when a 
neighbor approached Weinstein about investing $5,000 in a double-A team. 
Weinstein would have owned 10% of the franchise. . .now reportedly worth an 
estimated $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to business, he doesn't misfire very often. Weinstein has run 
the Chatsworth-based D/R Government Financing, which specializes in making 
small business loans, since 1967. The firm works in conjunction with the U.S. 
Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob is a deal-maker," said John Streit, an officer in the San Diego SBA 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 At various times during his business career, Weinstein has owned restaurants, 
a furniture store and worked as a stock broker. He spent more than 20 years 
listening to the pleas of folks trying to secure loans. Now he's on the other 
side of the desk, hawking his own wares. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't surprise me (when he came up with the GSL idea)," said Rudofsky, 
who has known Weinstein for 25 years. "He's entrepreneurial. He has a capacity 
to see the bigger picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Business has made Weinstein a baseball pragmatist, but he started as a 
romantic. Weinstein grew up near Ebbets Field, home of his beloved Brooklyn 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother's favorite keepsake was a foul ball off the bat of former Dodger 
Cookie Lavagetto. It conked her squarely in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein's uncle owned a DeSoto dealership located just beyond the outfield 
fence on Bedford Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Duke Snider and Ted Kluszewski kept smashing the showroom windows (with home 
runs)," Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, of course, eventually moved West, where the appetite for baseball 
was considerable. Still is, Weinstein figures. 
</P>
<P>
 California, despite a population of 30 million, is represented in the minors 
only by the 10-team California League. Weinstein desperately wants to fill the 
perceived void. 
</P>
<P>
 Streit said Weinstein has a reputation in SBA circles as a tireless worker 
with a solid reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of those guys who's fearless when it comes to trying new things," 
Streit said. "He's always been up front. He hasn't pitched me any curveballs." 
</P>
<P>
 Life threw plenty of them Weinstein's way as a youngster. His father died of a 
heart attack when he was 5, so his mother taught him the game. He was a solid 
player before a nasty car accident in 1960, during his senior year in high 
school in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein's left foot was crushed and his spine was injured. He walks with a 
slight limp. 
</P>
<P>
 Five back surgeries later, through sheer determination, he somehow manages to 
play golf. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of grit and mettle will be compulsory if Weinstein is to deliver his 
GSL project. 
</P>
<P>
 Months of delays and snags have tested Weinstein's patience, and in July he 
went over the edge. Weinstein thought he'd reached a verbal agreement with 
Lancaster about finding a stadium site, which would have given the GSL its 
first toe-hold. Not so. Believing he'd been misled by Lancaster officials, 
Weinstein called a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 He claimed officials had failed to negotiate in good faith, adding, "Lancaster 
wants to play ostrich." 
</P>
<P>
 The following week, Lancaster fired a salvo of its own. Lyle Norton, the 
director of Parks, Recreation and Arts, torched Weinstein in a two-page memo to 
City Manager Jim Gilley, which became public. Norton said Weinstein 
misrepresented the status of his negotiations with other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Lancaster official said Weinstein was full of "empty promises." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein has a credibility problem because he won't reveal the source of his 
supposed $50 million nest egg. Weinstein's attorney said the funding is 
predicated on whether the league lands letters of intent from advertisers and 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Streit expressed surprise at the reported size of Weinstein's GSL seed money. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a big hunk of change, even for somebody with his connections," Streit 
said. "When Merv Griffin retired, somebody said they'd read somewhere that he 
was a billionaire and asked him how he'd done it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Griffin said, 'Not with my own money.' I doubt Bob's doing this with his own 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 All Weinstein is asking of various city governments is a chance to fail. He'll 
be the fall guy if the GSL bankroll isn't as extensive as he claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever said baseball is a microcosm of life was right," he said. "It's 
taught me that it's never over till it's over. We're gonna play ball."

COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL PREVIEW; MATADORS WILL BEGIN A NEW ERA UNDER LU; NORTHRIDGE: 
FIRST-YEAR CSUN WOMEN'S COACH STRESSES DEFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lian Kang Lu, recognized as one of the world's foremost volleyball coaches, 
will begin a new chapter in his career today when the Cal State Northridge 
women's team plays Fresno State in the opening match of the Anteater 
Invitational at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu was an assistant for the UC Santa Barbara women's team from 1984-93 after 
coaching the Mexican national team in 1982-83 and the Beijing women's 
professional team from 1968-81, but this is his first stint as a college head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lu says being a head coach at the NCAA Division I level "is no big 
deal" because of his experience, his hiring at Northridge last December was 
considered a major coup for a program that had been rocked by off-the-court 
controversy the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors finished 12-17 last season under John Price, who took over the 
program on a one-year interim basis after the four finalists to replace 
previous coach Walt Ker declined the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Ker posted a 401-144 record during his 14 seasons at Northridge and guided the 
Matadors to their first berth in the Division I playoffs in 1992, yet he 
resigned abruptly in January of 1993, citing "family reasons" for his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Later it was learned that Ker's resignation came after two Northridge players 
filed a written complaint accusing him of sexual harassment. Other former 
players also alleged that Ker had consensual sexual relations with players in 
the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, who guided the Matador men's team to the 1993 NCAA final, tried to get 
the Northridge women to play a fast-paced attacking game, but they struggled in 
that role. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu, 60, values a strong attack, but says the heart and soul of a quality 
women's team is its defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing defense gives you a good will, a good fighting spirit," he said. "It 
makes you tough. . . . It's very important in women's volleyball because there 
are so many rallies." 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Kristich, one of the Matadors' four returning starters, says it's taken 
time to adapt to Lu's system, but she and her teammates are learning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely very different because we're used to a more attacking kind of 
style," Kristich said. "We're going to have to get used to it. We're getting 
better all the time, but I think it's going to take us a month or so before we 
really start to play like we're capable of." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristich, a 6-foot-1 middle blocker, is one of five seniors in the starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 The others are left-side hitters Aimee Stone (5-10) and Missy Clements (5-11), 
right-side hitter Heather Anderson (6-2), and setter Kathleen Shannon (5-8), a 
transfer from Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone led the team in kills (458) and digs (352) last season. Clements ranked 
second with 405 kills, and Kristich had a team-high 136 total blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon had 687 assists for Illinois (18-13) last season and led the Fighting 
Illini to the second round of the NCAA playoffs after moving into the starting 
lineup following an 0-5 start. She transferred to Northridge in the spring to 
be close to fiance J.J. O'Laughlin, starting quarterback on the Matador 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, freshman Gretchen Gulbranson had 947 assists as the setter for 
the Matadors. Gulbranson's transfer to Moorpark College has left Northridge 
with a lack of depth at the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Randi Winn, a starter at Utah State last year, was expected to back up 
Shannon, but Lu said she left the team for personal reasons two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves sophomore Erin Balderama as the reserve setter. The 5-7 defensive 
specialist is also expected to see extensive action as a back-row substitute 
for Stephanie Pfau, the Matadors' other starting middle blocker. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfau, a 6-foot freshman, was an All-Southern Section Division III selection 
for South Torrance High last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stephanie has shown good consistency in practice," Lu said. "She just lacks 
(college) experience." 
</P>
<P>
 With only six of its 25 regular-season matches at home this year, Northridge 
must win consistently on the road to have a successful campaign. But Kristich 
doesn't think that will be a problem. She said a return engagement in the 
Division I playoffs is conceivable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't really been talked about that much, but I think everyone's thinking 
that," she said. "I think it's a definite possibility."

 The Texas Rangers and Pittsburgh Pirates moved to save money by calling up 
minor league players, who will not be paid as long as the major league strike 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers brought up outfielders David Hulse and Rob Ducey from triple-A 
Oklahoma City, and Pittsburgh recalled left-handed pitcher Randy Tomlin from 
triple-A Buffalo and put him on the 15-day disabled list. Tomlin had been on 
the disabled list at Buffalo and hasn't pitched since July 20.

DISNEYLAND GIVES LOCALS A BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In another sign of dwindling attendance, Disneyland said Thursday that it will 
begin a locals-only discount admission today that will slash an entry ticket to 
$23, an $8 price break. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California residents who can show proof of their address may buy as 
many as eight discounted tickets.The $23 ticket costs the same for adults and 
children. Regular prices are $31 for adults and $25 for children age 3 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland instituted similar price cuts at the start of California's 
recession, during the winter season. Until then, the park had never offered 
across-the-board discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance has dropped at both Walt Disney Co.'s original theme park in 
Anaheim and Walt Disney World in Florida. As a result, company officials have 
warned of impending staff cuts and have threatened to contract out such 
services as staffing the employee cafeteria.

PANEL TO SEEK $1 MILLION TO LURE VISITORS TO O.C.; TOURISM: STATE, COUNTY AND 
CITY GOVERNMENTS AND BUSINESSES THAT BENEFIT WOULD EACH HELP PAY FOR AN 
ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN PITCHED AT VACATIONERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A panel studying how to promote Orange County as a vacation destination will 
likely recommend an advertising budget of at least $1 million a year funded 
equally by government and business, its chairman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The state, county and individual cities would each pay a share, while Orange 
County businesses that benefit from tourism -- from Disneyland to the Crystal 
Cathedral -- would split the rest, said committee chairman Jack Lindquist, 
retired president of Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding framework emerged from the Orange County Tourism Steering 
Committee, formed at the request of Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly and County 
Supervisors William G. Steiner and Gaddi H. Vasquez to study marketing the 
county as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has been looking for a way to compete against such destinations 
as Las Vegas and San Diego, which spend millions of dollars a year on 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a great deal of enthusiasm in marketing this county as a whole and 
recognition from all segments that they have to be a part," Lindquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 But who pays how much could be a sticking point. Lindquist said he envisions 
the private sector's share being apportioned by industry. Theme parks and 
attractions, for instance, would probably pay the most because they benefit the 
most. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee would be selected from each industry to determine its fair share 
and make sure everyone pays up. Lindquist said the campaign will not go forward 
until an agreement is reached on funding. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the money would go for the campaign itself and hiring an advertising 
agency to design it, Lindquist said. No separate group would be appointed to 
oversee collection and spending of money, he said. "We don't want to create 
another bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 The two county supervisors who have been pushing for a countywide plan said 
Thursday that they are impressed with the group's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's something worth exploring," Vasquez said. "I'm encouraged 
because it's a visionary effort that is a public-private partnership."

STOCK OF AST RESEARCH FALLS 27% AFTER FIRM SAYS IT WILL POST LOSS; TECHNOLOGY: 
IRVINE COMPUTER MAKER'S TROUBLES APPARENTLY PROMPTED A GENERAL SELLOFF IN 
TECHNOLOGY SHARES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Street investors hammered computer maker AST Research Inc. on Thursday, 
driving down its stock price 27% after the company said it would post a loss 
for the current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based company, whose rapid growth has surpassed the industry's pace 
for the past year, led a general Wall Street disenchantment with computer 
company stocks as investors fretted over large inventories and steep price cuts 
that may ultimately reduce their dividends this year. 
</P>
<P>
 AST stock fell $4.94 a share to close at $13.06 in Nasdaq trading. About 14.9 
million AST shares changed hands, making it the most heavily traded Wall Street 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other computer makers' shares also declined Thursday, analysts said 
the problems at AST -- an unusual confluence of product delays, parts shortages 
and atypically lower profit margins -- are specific to the company. The entire 
industry, though, may feel the pressures of recent retail price cuts of 20% to 
27% if the discounts fail to generate a boom in sales, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are very skittish about whether the industry is in good shape or in 
bad shape," said analyst Richard S. Chu at Cowen & Co. in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that uneasiness, AST's troubles appeared to trigger a general selloff in 
technology shares, said analyst Philip Rueppel at the brokerage Alex. Brown & 
Sons in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The AST stock skid was no surprise. The company reported late Wednesday that 
it expects a loss for its fiscal first quarter, which ends Sept. 30. The severe 
beating the stock took was not an overreaction, Rueppel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on AST's own projections, analysts had expected the company to post 
earnings of between 20 cents and 30 cents a share for the first quarter. Now 
they anticipate a loss of between 35 cents and 75 cents a share. Revenue, which 
had been expected to keep up with the latest quarter's total of $585 million, 
is now likely to be as much as $70 million less, Rueppel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock's decline took a chunk out of the net worth of AST's biggest 
shareholder, co-founder and Chairman Safi U. Qureshey, who owns 10.1% of the 
company's shares. The value of his personal holdings fell $15.9 million. No 
other individual owns more than 1% of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Qureshey was in China on Thursday with a Commerce Department delegation and 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 AST's announcement Wednesday "came out of the blue," said analyst William J. 
Milton Jr. at Brown Bros. Harriman in New York. He and other analysts had 
attended a daylong meeting with AST officials Aug. 2 near Dallas, he said, and 
"there was no hint that this was coming. This all happened in the last 30 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 Milton said that AST's product delays, reduced prices and increased 
advertising to sell its older inventory were already beginning to affect the 
company when Compaq Computer Corp. slashed prices 22% on some models 10 days 
ago. International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. followed 
with reductions of as much as 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 AST will have to compete in the latest round of cuts by offering even its new 
products at lower-than-anticipated prices, said James T. Schraith, AST 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the fierce competition, AST's new-product delays could not have come at 
a worse time. The company, which already has the lowest profit margin among 
major computer manufacturers, had expected to bring new laptop and desktop 
models to market in August, but it is only now shipping them. 
</P>
<P>
 When AST's Bravo MS, a desktop model driven by the latest Pentium 
microprocessor, makes its debut soon, the company will be forced to lower the 
price. Likewise, AST's new laptop model will probably hit the stores at a 
less-than-hoped-for price. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the industry resorted to major price cuts to sell a backlog of 
inventory was in 1992, and that created "significant" increased demand, said 
David Dukes, co-chairman of Ingram Micro Inc. in Santa Ana, the nation's 
leading computer distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where we are again," he said. "But this time, (profit) margins are 
dramatically lower than in '91, and manufacturers can't afford to let this 
price cut not spur demand. They need to have volume, and I'm optimistic that 
that's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But other observers are less optimistic, and some analysts are downgrading 
their recommendations on technology stocks. SoundView Financial Group Inc., for 
instance, recently switched from "buy" recommendations on Compaq and Microsoft 
Corp. to "hold." 
</P>
<P>
 As for AST, its stock probably will likely hover around $13 a share for some 
time, said James Reynolds, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los 
Angeles. Much will depend on how aggressive the industrywide cost-cutting 
becomes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schraith said AST expected to be hit hard Thursday. "Any time you disappoint 
your investors and the financial community, you'll see reactions of this sort," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both he and analysts say they expect AST to break even in its second fiscal 
quarter, which begins Oct. 1, and be profitable for the rest of its fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in the company's stock price and its lower revenue projection don't 
mean that demand is for AST's products is slack, Schraith said. "The problems 
are primarily internal, and we believe we have a handle on them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas C.K. Yuen, an AST co-founder who resigned in 1992, said Thursday 
that the company's projected first-quarter loss reflects deeper financial 
problems at the computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the company well enough to be very worried about their statements," 
Yuen said.

HEALTH INSURERS DENOUNCE HMO REFORM PACKAGE; MEDICINE: THREE MEASURES AWAITING 
THE GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE ARE AIMED AT PROTECTING CONSUMERS FROM ABUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health insurers on Thursday denounced a package of reform measures approved by 
the Legislature that are intended to protect consumers from abuses by health 
maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers said the three measures -- now awaiting Gov. Pete Wilson's signature 
before they can become law -- would impose costly and unneeded government 
regulations on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Wilson said the governor has made no decision yet about the 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The measures -- strongly opposed by the California Assn. of HMOs, an industry 
group -- would require health plans to publicly disclose more information about 
their profits and overall finances. They would impose requirements on insurers 
in resolving disputes with their members over the denial of medical services. 
</P>
<P>
 The measures were supported by a group of consumers, health professionals and 
labor organizations led by the California Medical Assn., which has been 
critical of the "exorbitant" profits of some insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For-profit HMOs are under increasing pressure to show an impressive bottom 
line to Wall Street investors," said Steve Thompson, vice president of 
government relations for the state's largest doctors group. "Legal protections 
must be created . . . to ensure that quality medical care is not compromised in 
the drive for profits." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the bills, by state Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), would 
require health plans to disclose to consumers what proportions of each premium 
dollar go to patient care, administrative costs and profits. It would also 
require the state to publish an annual financial report on all state-licensed 
health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report released earlier this year, the CMA found that paperwork, 
advertising, executive salaries and profits accounted for up to 30% of each 
medical premium dollar collected by health plans. As originally drafted, the 
bill would have capped health plans' administrative costs and profits at 15% of 
premium dollars. That restriction was dropped to gain the support of some 
Assembly Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The HMO trade group contends that such financial information is already 
provided in public filings with the state Department of Corporations, which 
regulates HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Kelch, director of health policy for the HMO group, said consumers 
won't benefit from detailed data about a health plan's finances. "Information 
about quality, price and services is what consumers want," she said, noting 
that HMOs are already providing more of that information. 
</P>
<P>
 But Danielle Walters, a CMA spokeswoman, said HMOs opposed the measure because 
they fear it could hurt profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The HMOs "keep claiming that consumers won't understand it, but we've had 
thousands of phone calls from labor groups and business managers who are using 
this (financial) information to negotiate with the plans" to get better prices, 
Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another measure, by Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-Modesto), would mandate when HMOs 
must pay for emergency medical care for their members who go outside the health 
plan's approved network of hospitals. The bill's supporters contend that HMOs 
sometimes refuse to pay for emergency treatment of members who go to 
out-of-network hospitals, often because they are closer than the HMO's 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelch said HMOs do allow members to go to the nearest hospital in actual 
medical emergencies and reimburse patients for those services.

 Gene R. Morgan, a Los Angeles underwriter of small stocks who also hosts a 
daily market-commentary show on Southland TV station KWHY, is facing a $50,000 
fine and a six-month suspension for allegedly misrepresenting a stock he 
underwrote and also promoted on his TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, brought by the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, the 
self-policing organization for brokerages, could have important ramifications 
for regulation of the mushrooming -- and largely unmonitored -- investment 
"infomercial" business. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision against Morgan by the NASD's Los Angeles district business 
conduct committee was handed down in May but wasn't made public, because Morgan 
has appealed it to the NASD's national business conduct committee. The Times 
obtained a copy of the district decision this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70-year-old Morgan has hosted his show on KWHY, which calls itself "The 
Business Channel," for 26 years. Morgan's 30-minute program is called "Charting 
the Market" and runs Monday through Friday at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan pays for the air time and uses the show to review broad market trends, 
promote investment seminars offered by his firm and others, and promote 
individual stocks that he also may underwrite for fee income. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Morgan Financial, his brokerage, was formed in 1984 and has underwritten 
a number of so-called emerging-growth stocks, some of them highly 
controversial. In June, 1991, for example, Morgan sponsored a stock offering by 
Spectrum Information Technologies Inc., a wireless communications company whose 
shares have since crashed amid allegations of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD case against Morgan involves a Utah-based developer of giant-screen 
theaters called International Tourist Entertainment Corp., which Morgan's 
brokerage underwrote in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a complaint, NASD compliance officials reviewed tapes of 
Morgan's TV show from Oct. 20-30, 1992. The NASD district committee found that 
Morgan failed "to provide a sound basis for the public to evaluate ITEC and 
(made) communications . . . that contained untrue statements of material facts 
or were otherwise exaggerated, false or misleading." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the NASD said Morgan's TV comments did not present ITEC for 
what it was: a development-stage firm whose securities were "highly risky," as 
was noted in the stock offering prospectus Morgan helped to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his shows, the NASD said, "Morgan stated without qualification that 
'ITEC's attraction is a solid financial transaction (sic) appropriate for all 
types of accounts. Pension and profit-sharing, widows and orphans, and 
literally anyone who wants to experience enhancement of capital.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing ITEC, Morgan also told viewers that "seldom do we ever see a 
transaction that has the prospects of real bottom-line net profits in the first 
full year of business operation," and he urged them to "get their money in." 
The prospectus, however, noted that ITEC might not have significant revenue for 
12 to 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, ITEC, which now has one theater open (in Branson, Mo.) claims that it 
was profitable for the first time in July, though its latest financial 
statements have not yet been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan did not return phone calls, but his Dallas-based attorney, Arthur F. 
Selander, said his client would appeal the case to federal court if necessary. 
Selander said Morgan contests the NASD decision "as it relates to the technical 
kind of violations" alleged, though the complaint states that "most of the 
facts underlying the violations (have been) admitted" by Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 Selander contends that the dispute is "solely between the NASD and Gene Morgan 
Financial. No investors have complained" about the way ITEC stock was pitched, 
he said. He noted that investors had to get a prospectus -- and, at least in 
theory, read it -- before they could buy the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "ITEC has been a very successful investment," Selander said. The initial 
offering, which consisted of a unit containing one ITEC share and one warrant, 
was sold at $5 each. The last Nasdaq trade in the units was on July 26, at $7. 
</P>
<P>
 For the NASD and state and federal securities watchdogs, the Morgan case may 
be used to send a message about greater regulatory oversight of the booming 
investment infomercial business on TV and radio. Even with usual disclaimers 
that remind viewers and listeners that the show host is being paid to promote a 
particular investment, regulators fear that the public often may not get the 
message, and may stumble into unsuitable investments. 
</P>
<P>
 And with future TV technology promising a virtually limitless number of 
channels, "there is a lot of air time (coming) for infomercials," said Scott 
Stapf, investment education adviser to the North American Securities 
Administrators Assn. in Arlington, Va. Even now, policing the airwaves is 
difficult for strapped regulators, Stapf said, and paid stock promoters can 
seek shelter behind a heavy shield: the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, KWHY notes that Morgan's show runs with a disclaimer at the 
beginning and end, and that on-screen type shows up periodically during the 
show noting that it is a paid commercial program. Even so, sales manager Linda 
Miller said that "we have asked Mr. Morgan to get away from" promoting 
individual stocks and focus on broad market trends, though he has not yet 
indicated he will permanently make that shift, she said.

COMPANY TOWN; PRIME-TIME TARGETS; STUDIOS COVET NETWORKS AS A SOURCE OF RERUN 
RICHES 
</P>

<P>
 Fox Inc. already has one. Paramount Communications is building one. Time 
Warner is building one and interested in buying one. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcast networks, laughed off as dinosaurs in the age of cable and emerging 
multimedia technology, are hot properties again in the 1990s. In a remarkable 
turnaround that's at least partly due to the major studios' drive to guarantee 
air time for their shows, network broadcasting has made a stunning resurgence, 
although its long-term prognosis remains shaky. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere, perhaps, is the change in conventional wisdom better illustrated than 
in Time Warner Inc.'s negotiations to acquire the broadcasting and cable 
interests of NBC. Time Warner once looked down its nose at broadcasting, 
betting that cable and pay TV services such as HBO would be the high-growth 
enterprises of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 But new federal regulations allowing the networks to produce their own shows 
have raised fears that the traditional producers -- notably the major Hollywood 
studios owned by companies such as Time Warner -- will be crowded out. Since 
those companies receive lucrative fees from TV production and syndication, many 
are now committed to controlling both ends of the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "November, 1995, is the triple-witching hour," says Los Angeles entertainment 
attorney Ken Ziffren. "At that point, massive deregulation can kick in, where 
basically there will be no rules as we know them today that restrict the 
networks" from owning their own shows. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, there was no word of any movement in the Time Warner-NBC merger 
talks, said to be progressing at a leisurely pace. If the two sides overcome 
stiff regulatory hurdles on cable issues and strike a deal, analysts agree, it 
will put pressure on other networks and studios to consider merging or forming 
strategic joint ventures. As television becomes the chief entertainment medium 
around the world, control of its content becomes the key economic issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner's Warner Bros. unit, the leading supplier of prime-time network 
programs, with 8 1/2 hours of shows sold for the fall, could be hit especially 
hard by such changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The need to be sure of an outlet for programming points up even more how 
studios such as MCA, Sony and Disney will be exposed unless they forge their 
own ventures or mergers. Although foreign companies are barred from owning TV 
stations, they are allowed to own TV networks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warner Bros. is the largest producer of TV programming in the world," said 
one investor who owns stakes in several media companies. "But unless they 
vertically integrate, they will be out of the (TV) production business." The 
same holds true for the others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rights to a hit TV program can be more profitable than a blockbuster 
motion picture and more lucrative than selling advertising time on network TV 
shows. Hit comedies such as "The Cosby Show" generated nearly $900 million in 
rerun profits. By comparison, the combined profits of ABC, CBS and NBC were 
about $664 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The networks are really looking at two businesses now," said Grant Tinker, 
former chairman of NBC. "The old one -- revenues from advertising -- and the 
new one -- revenues from programs. There's a lot of money in software." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of losing revenue has studio executives in a deep funk. In recent 
years, they have watched the networks produce more and more of their news and 
entertainment in-house rather than commissioning outside suppliers. For the 
1994-95 season, 24% of the networks' prime-time schedule will be produced 
in-house, compared to 15% for the 1992-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The networks, in terms of gross production dollars a few years out, will 
probably be the equivalent of a medium-size studio," predicted David Londoner 
of Wertheim Schroder in New York. "At $500 million per network, that's a 
significant market decrease for the studios." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood studios now must elbow the networks -- their biggest customers -- 
for "shelf space" on network program schedules. The goal for a show's producer, 
whether studio or network, is 75 episodes -- the minimum required for reruns in 
syndication. And producers need many shots at getting on the schedule, since 
most new shows fail. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest reasons for network popularity are a far cry from those of years 
ago. Networks were hot properties in the 1960s, '70s and early '80s, when they 
commanded 90% of the TV audience and advertising revenues were skyrocketing at 
a double-digit clip. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS' highly rated coverage of the past season's Winter Olympics alerted some 
people to the value of networks, but the bigger impact came from a bitter, 
decade-long Washington lobbying campaign by ABC, CBS and NBC for the rights to 
produce and own more of the shows they air. That battle pitted the three 
networks -- Fox technically does not qualify as a network -- against the major 
studios. While the rule change allows the networks to get deeper into the 
programming business, it also allows the studios to poach on the networks' 
turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Paramount and Warner Bros. are hoping to start a "fifth network" in 
January, with two nights of programming. The keystone of the United Paramount 
Network -- a joint venture with TV station group Chris-Craft -- is "Star Trek: 
Voyager," the third spinoff of the "Star Trek" series, which is produced by 
Paramount. Three of the four comedies slated for the WB Television Network are 
also under the Warner Bros. TV banner. 
</P>
<P>
 The studios' networks are "a backlash to the networks having made it clear 
they are going to own and produce more of their own shows," said Alan Berger, 
head of the TV department at ICM. "The studios don't want to be beholden to the 
networks any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 But one analyst notes that in the renewed rush to embrace the broadcast 
networks, people are forgetting that the business is "highly cyclical" -- 
dependent both on ratings and the economy. And when the ratings are in the 
trough -- as inevitably happens in a hit-driven business -- and the economy is 
in a downturn, the combination can be financially disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pretty nasty part will come in the next recession when we find out we 
have too many networks," said Harold Vogel of Merrill Lynch. "A few years ago, 
there were three networks and only enough advertising to support two. What 
happens when there are five networks and only enough advertising to support 
three? Someone is really going to be suffering at that point, and none too 
happy." Jockeying for Air Space 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner's merger talks with NBC reflect the new reality in television, in 
which major entertainment companies want to be able to guarantee air space for 
their programs. In addition to the NBC talks, Time Warner is working to build 
its own WBTV Network. Paramount is also committed to creating a new network.

STOCK OF AST RESEARCH FALLS 27% AFTER FIRM SAYS IT WILL POST LOSS; TECHNOLOGY: 
COMPUTER MAKER'S TROUBLES APPARENTLY PROMPTED A GENERAL SELLOFF IN TECHNOLOGY 
SHARES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Wall Street investors hammered computer maker AST Research Inc. on Thursday, 
driving down its stock price 27% after the company said it would post a loss 
for the current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based company, whose rapid growth has surpassed the industry's pace 
for the past year, led a general Wall Street disenchantment with computer 
company stocks as investors fretted over large inventories and steep price cuts 
that may ultimately reduce their dividends this year. 
</P>
<P>
 AST stock fell $4.94 a share to close at $13.06 in Nasdaq trading. About 14.9 
million AST shares changed hands, making it the most heavily traded Wall Street 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other computer makers' shares also declined Thursday, analysts said 
the problems at AST -- an unusual confluence of product delays, parts shortages 
and atypically lower profit margins -- are specific to the company. The entire 
industry, though, may feel the pressures of recent retail price cuts of 20% to 
27% if the discounts fail to generate a boom in sales, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are very skittish about whether the industry is in good shape or in 
bad shape," said analyst Richard S. Chu at Cowen & Co. in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that uneasiness, AST's troubles appeared to trigger a general selloff in 
technology shares, said analyst Philip Rueppel at the brokerage Alex. Brown & 
Sons in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The AST stock skid was no surprise. The company reported late Wednesday that 
it expects a loss for its fiscal first quarter, which ends Sept. 30. The severe 
beating the stock took was not an overreaction, Rueppel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on AST's own projections, analysts had expected the company to post 
earnings of between 20 cents and 30 cents a share for the first quarter. Now 
they anticipate a loss of between 35 cents and 75 cents a share. Revenue, which 
had been expected to keep up with the latest quarter's total of $585 million, 
is now likely to be as much as $70 million less, Rueppel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock's decline took a chunk out of the net worth of AST's biggest 
shareholder, co-founder and Chairman Safi U. Qureshey, who owns 10.1% of the 
company's shares. The value of his personal holdings fell $15.9 million. No 
other individual owns more than 1% of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Qureshey was in China on Thursday with a Commerce Department delegation and 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 AST's announcement Wednesday "came out of the blue," said analyst William J. 
Milton Jr. at Brown Bros. Harriman in New York. He and other analysts had 
attended a daylong meeting with AST officials Aug. 2 near Dallas, he said, and 
"there was no hint that this was coming. This all happened in the last 30 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 Milton said that AST's product delays, reduced prices and increased 
advertising to sell its older inventory were already beginning to affect the 
company when Compaq Computer Corp. slashed prices 22% on some models 10 days 
ago. International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. followed 
with reductions of as much as 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 AST will have to compete in the latest round of cuts by offering even its new 
products at lower-than-anticipated prices, said James T. Schraith, AST 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the fierce competition, AST's new-product delays could not have come at 
a worse time. The company, which already has the lowest profit margin among 
major computer manufacturers, had expected to bring new laptop and desktop 
models to market in August, but it is only now shipping them. 
</P>
<P>
 When AST's Bravo MS, a desktop model driven by the latest Pentium 
microprocessor, makes its debut soon, the company will be forced to lower the 
price. Likewise, AST's new laptop model will probably hit the stores at a 
less-than-hoped-for price. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the industry resorted to major price cuts to sell a backlog of 
inventory was in 1992, and that created "significant" increased demand, said 
David Dukes, co-chairman of Ingram Micro Inc. in Santa Ana, the nation's 
leading computer distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where we are again," he said. "But this time, (profit) margins are 
dramatically lower than in '91, and manufacturers can't afford to let this 
price cut not spur demand. They need to have volume, and I'm optimistic that 
that's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But other observers are less optimistic, and some analysts are downgrading 
their recommendations on technology stocks. SoundView Financial Group Inc., for 
instance, recently switched from "buy" recommendations on Compaq and Microsoft 
Corp. to "hold." The Long Decline 
</P>
<P>
 After peaking earlier this year, AST Research stock has gradually declined, 
and it took a huge fall Thursday. Weekly closes, except latest:

 Thursday: $13.06 down $4.94

AVIS AGREES TO EQUIP CARS FOR DISABLED; CONSUMERS: RENTAL FIRM IS COMMENDED BY 
JUSTICE DEPT. FOR ITS COOPERATION. TEN OTHER COMPANIES ALSO FACE COMPLAINTS. 
</P>

<P>
 In a Justice Department settlement that may set a standard for the car rental 
industry, Avis Inc. agreed Thursday to provide autos with hand controls for 
customers with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials said the voluntary settlement came after complaints were 
filed against Avis, the nation's second-largest car rental company, and 10 
other rental car firms by people who said they were being denied service in 
violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, demonstrating the hand controls on an Avis car in 
the department's courtyard, commended the firm for its cooperation and said the 
settlement shows how business can take the initiative to comply with the 1990 
law, which prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I urge other companies throughout America to follow their example," Reno 
said. "Barriers must be removed, not only because it's the law, but because it 
makes good business sense (and) it's the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that 10 competitors of Avis, including nationally known and regional 
car rental companies, are under department scrutiny for similar alleged 
shortcomings. But she declined to name them. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Hertz Corp., the largest company in the industry, said they are 
not involved in negotiations with the Justice Department because they have 
offered the hand controls for some time. Virginia Carlson, Hertz's senior staff 
counsel, said the company provides the specialized vehicles with at least 24 
hours' notice at all of its large corporate rental locations in the United 
States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the Avis settlement, the hand-control equipment, which can be 
installed on most cars in about 10 minutes and later removed, will be available 
at no extra charge with eight hours' notice at 20 of Avis' largest airport 
counters. At most other large sites, the equipment must be offered with 24 
hours' notice. Smaller or more remote Avis counters will be allowed to require 
reservations 48 hours in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 John L. Wodatch, an attorney in the Justice Department's civil rights 
division, said Avis is absorbing the cost of the equipment, which ranges from 
$200 to $500 per car. He said negotiations with the 10 other companies involve 
"varying degrees of cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
 If the department cannot obtain voluntary agreements, "we have a whole range 
of enforcement actions, and we would be willing to take them," Wodatch said. 
</P>
<P>
 An official of the National Organization on Disability in Washington said of 
the agreement, "It's welcome news for any person with a disability, and for a 
company like Avis, it's good business." 
</P>
<P>
 Avis Vice President John J. Lynch agreed that "it's good business sense to 
make Avis' services available to everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Reno at Thursday's demonstration was Sally Conway, an employee of the 
civil rights division who uses a wheelchair. She showed how a car can be driven 
with hand controls for the accelerator and brakes. Reno remarked that "this 
agreement comes on the eve of a holiday weekend when many Americans take to the 
road to vacation with family and friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Avis has also agreed for the first time to permit disabled 
people who cannot drive, such as those with visual impairments or seizure 
disorders, to be the financially responsible party under a rental agreement in 
which another person is the driver. In addition, the company will begin 
allowing people who are unemployed because of a disability and who do not have 
credit cards to rent cars on a cash basis. Previously, such customers had to 
show proof of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Title III of the 1990 law prohibits discrimination against people with 
disabilities using public accommodations, including rental cars. It requires 
businesses to remove barriers to access where it is readily achievable or can 
be accomplished without much difficulty or expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the act, the Justice Department has reached nearly 300 settlements with 
hotels, amusement parks, bowling centers, health spas, zoos, stadiums and movie 
theaters.

 Mission Hills Firm to Be Liquidated: Banking regulators in Texas and 
California moved to liquidate Providence Trust Co., a Texas-based trust company 
whose Mission Hills office served about 1,650 Californians, after Providence 
was deemed insolvent. Regulators said Providence took about $3 million in fees 
that should have been reimbursed to more than 3,000 of its customers in the two 
states and that liquidation will help those consumers get their share of the 
money back. No Californians are expected to lose money and many may get 
refunds, the regulators said.

 Chains Report Mixed Results for August: Retail sales were mixed during August, 
but the results reported by big-store owners Thursday harbored good omens for 
their back-to-school business and the holiday shopping season.August sales 
indicate consumers are willing to spend but that they're likely to remain 
highly selective about where they shop. Some retailers, including Wal-Mart 
Stores Inc. and Dayton Hudson Corp., reported sales figures slightly off their 
recent stronger pace. Specialty apparel chains such as Limited Inc. continued 
to report sluggish sales, but department stores had a good month.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS DAMPENED BY SELLOFF IN TECH ISSUES; DOW OFF 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A selloff in technology issues led the stock market broadly lower Thursday, 
its second decline after August's powerful rally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average eased just 11.98 points to 3,901.44, but 
broader indexes suffered much larger losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks, heavy with tech issues, 
slumped 6.67 points, or nearly 0.9%, to 758.95. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, losers topped winners by 13 to 8, though 
volume retreated to 283 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The market's tone was set in the morning, as bond yields rose. The bond market 
was responding to a report from a nationwide manufacturing association, showing 
another increase in prices of raw materials in August -- even as overall 
manufacturing activity cooled. 
</P>
<P>
 The report suggested rising inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 But bonds soon recouped their losses in listless activity, as traders 
positioned for today's government report on August employment. The 30-year 
Treasury bond yield ended unchanged at 7.45%. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks, however, continued to be pressured by the influence of slumping 
technology issues, after major personal computer maker AST Research shocked 
Wall Street by projecting a quarterly loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * AST plunged 4 15/16 to 13 1/16, and PC makers and suppliers in general were 
off sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Owen, managing director of trading at research firm SoundView, said 
analysts at his firm are concerned that a price war and diminishing orders will 
compress the margins for PC companies. Soundview downgraded Compaq and 
Microsoft, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq dived 2 1/4 to 35, Microsoft fell 2 to 56 1/8, Apple dropped 1 3/16 to 
35, Dell Computer eased 1 to 31 1/2, National Semiconductor fell 1 1/4 to 17 
3/8 and IBM lost 5/8 to 67 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 But some traders also noted that tech stocks were overdue for profit taking 
after strong gains in August. "Some of these have gotten extended, and that's 
the reason you're seeing some of them getting hit so hard," said Jonathan Dodd, 
analyst at Dean Witter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Profit taking also hit industrial issues. Dover dropped 1 1/4 to 56 5/8, 
Deere lost 1 3/4 to 72 1/2, Caterpillar fell 1 to 114 3/8, Nucor lost 3/4 to 68 
1/4 and Alcoa slipped 1 to 83. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many food and drug issues also gave ground. CPC Intl. dropped 2 1/8 to 51 
1/4, Hershey sank 1 1/8 to 46 7/8, Pfizer lost 3/4 to 67 1/2 and Warner Lambert 
slid 1 3/8 to 82 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retail stocks were mostly flat after reporting August sales, but 
disappointing reports sent Gap down 4 3/4 to 38 1/4 and Dayton Hudson down 3 
5/8 to 81 1/8. Federated, however, soared 1 3/8 to 22 1/2 on its report. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the entertainment sector, CBS jumped 11 1/8 to 332 1/2 on new takeover 
rumors focusing again on Disney. Also, Casino Magic leaped 1 7/8 to 8 7/8 on 
rumors that Caesars World may make a bid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Electric utility stocks suffered a wallop on the heels of a disappointing 
rate case decision in New York. The Dow utility index tumbled 3.49 points to 
185.67, as Con Ed dropped 1 to 26 1/4, Niagara Mohawk slumped 1 3/4 to 13 1/8 
and Houston Industries lost 3/4 to 34. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 index fell 34.8 points to 3,216.5 amid speculation 
that the Bank of England will raise interest rates to cool the British economy. 
The market drew no strength from a jump in the pound's value. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, shares finished the day lower after the Bundesbank announced it 
was leaving interest rates unchanged. The DAX index lost 12.05 points to 
2,200.80. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei average rose 14.40 points to 20,642.93. Mexico City's 
Bolsa index slipped 9.12 points to 2,693.61.

CHAINS REPORT MIXED RESULTS FOR AUGUST; RETAILING: DEPARTMENT STORES HAD A GOOD 
MONTH, BODING WELL FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON. SPECIALTY APPAREL CHAINS WERE 
SLUGGISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Retail sales were mixed during August, but the results reported by big-store 
owners Thursday harbored good omens for their back-to-school business and the 
holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
 August sales indicate consumers are willing to spend but that they're likely 
to remain highly selective about where they shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Some retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Dayton Hudson Corp., 
reported sales figures slightly off their recent stronger pace. Specialty 
apparel chains such as Limited Inc. continued to report sluggish sales, but 
department stores had a good month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beginning of the month was relatively slow, but it ended up with a bang," 
retailing analyst and consultant Walter Loeb said. "I am confident that the 
fall season will accelerate." 
</P>
<P>
 The back-to-school season is one of retail sales' best for apparel. 
Historically, it has also been an indicator of how retailers will do during the 
crucial holiday shopping season, during which merchants often make half their 
annual profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still expect an improving environment during the second half of the year, 
aided by favorable economic factors such as employment growth, personal income 
gains and likely continued low inflation," said Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with 
Salomon Bros. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers are increasingly buying their clothes in department stores rather 
than in the specialty chains that dominated the apparel business a few years 
ago. If that pattern holds, department stores will have a strong holiday season 
and the specialty chains will languish, which is what happened in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Department stores have improved their lot over the past two years by offering 
consumers better selections and more for their money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salomon Bros. retail index, the investment firm's barometer of sales 
performance, rose 4.9% after a 3.9% gain in July. For August, 1993, the index 
was up 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, said sales from stores open at least 
a year -- same-store sales -- rose 6.6% from last August; total sales were up 
22%. 
</P>
<P>
 Same-store sales are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
strength. They exclude the results of newer stores, where sales tend to be 
unusually high, and also exclude results from stores closed over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart Corp. said same-store sales rose 3.7% and that overall business was up 
8.6%. The numbers were an improvement over the company's performance in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, Roebuck & Co. said same-store sales advanced 5.2% and that overall 
sales rose 5.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton Hudson said same-store sales rose 1.4% and that overall business picked 
up 7.8%. The company said back-to-school business at its California-based 
Mervyn's clothing chain was weaker than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 J.C. Penney Co. said same-store sales at its flagship stores rose 10.9% and 
that total sales, including its drugstore and catalogue operations, rose 10.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Limited Inc., stymied for several years by an inability to get its fashion 
statement right, reported same-store sales were unchanged but that overall 
business rose 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Gap Inc. said same-store sales fell 5% and that total sales rose 6%.

FACTORY SURVEY SHOWS INFLATION AT RAW MATERIALS LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The economy cooled in August but not enough to put the freeze on inflation, 
according to a widely followed survey of industrial companies released 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Purchasing Management's report for August shows activity 
at the nation's factories expanded at a much weaker pace than at any time in 
the last eight months, suggesting that the economy is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the survey, considered a key economic forecasting tool, revealed that the 
number of companies reporting higher prices for raw materials rose to the 
highest level in six years, suggesting that inflation pressures still threaten 
the economy because those price increases are likely to be passed on to 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said the data doesn't necessarily mean a spiral of higher prices is 
imminent. Rather, they said, the survey reflects the inflationary effects of 
strong economic growth in the first half of the year. "We probably won't see a 
real slowdown in prices until a few months down the road," said Bernie 
Markstein, chief economist at Meridian Bancorp. in Reading, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchasing managers report coincided with the release of other economic 
data that presents a mixed picture of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekly unemployment insurance claims reported by the Labor Department hit a 
six-week high, as merchants and other businesses began laying off seasonal 
employees. Leading retailers said August sales were mixed. The Commerce 
Department said construction spending rose moderately in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchasing managers manufacturing index, based on responses from 300 large 
U.S. industrial firms, fell to 56.2% in August from 57.8% in July. 
</P>
<P>
 An index reading above 50% indicates an expansion, while a reading below 50% 
indicates a decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Factory production grew at a lower level than in July and new orders were down 
at more companies than in the month before, the survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
 But the purchasing managers price index, closely watched by financial markets, 
jumped to 74.5% from July's 73.1%, its highest level since August, 1988. It was 
the fifth month in a row that the index rose. 
</P>
<P>
 "This increase in material prices is one of the strongest concerns of 
purchasers," said Ralph G. Kauffman, chairman of the association's business 
survey committee.  
</P>
<P>
 The price component roiled financial markets because stock and bond investors 
tend to sell at signs of inflation, which can erode the value of investments 
such as Treasury bonds and other securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike professional securities traders, most economists weren't alarmed by the 
price component, because they believe that the impact of higher interest rates 
has not yet caught up to industrial firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Markstein and other economists said that materials prices were higher in 
August because suppliers were still seeing heavy demand for goods from 
factories whose businesses were humming in the first six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 But as higher interest rates cause consumers and corporations to scale back 
their spending and expansion plans, factories will become less busy and demand 
for materials will subside, driving prices down.

 More Charges Filed Against Lefkowitz: A federal grand jury in Minneapolis has 
brought two new criminal charges against Gary Lefkowitz, former president of 
Citi Equity Corp. of Culver City. Lefkowitz was charged in May with 45 counts 
of fraud, embezzlement, tax evasion and obstruction of justice.The indictment 
alleged that he engaged in a scheme to bilk developers, investors and the 
federal government out of as much as $50 million that was to be used to build 
low-income housing. The new charges allege Lefkowitz engaged in bankruptcy 
fraud and orchestration of a continuing financial crimes enterprise in which he 
illegally obtained $5 million. Lefkowitz, 41, of Beverly Hills, has pleaded 
innocent and is expected to stand trial early next year.

 Guilty Plea in Fraud Case: Anthony Fadel, co-owner of Fadel Group Investment, 
admitted in federal court in Los Angeles that he and two partners were involved 
in a scheme that defrauded some 4,000 Spanish-speaking investors out of $10 
million.Fadel Group claimed clients would earn a 22% return through real estate 
investments, according to federal prosecutors. But most of the money was kept 
by the partners for personal use, said Fadel, who pleaded guilty to mail fraud, 
tax evasion and making false statements on loan applications. He will be 
sentenced Nov. 11. In June, Fadel partner Jose Castellanos pleaded guilty in 
the same case. Business manager Epigmenio Sandoval remains a fugitive.

adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 
5.49%, down from 5.54% last week. Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for 
people refinancing mortgages, averaged 7.96% this week, down from 8.05% a week

NICHOLS COMPLETES CORNING MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nichols Institute on Thursday completed its merger with glass and housewares 
maker Corning Inc. in a transaction valued at about $325 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Corning also assumed about $100 million of Nichols' debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols, based in San Juan Capistrano, will be combined with Corning Life 
Sciences. The new unit, which will be called Corning Nichols Institute, will 
include Nichols' diagnostic unit and will focus on esoteric testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols' remaining regional laboratory sites will be consolidated with 
Corning's clinical laboratories, which are based in Teterboro, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Corning, which began offering laboratory-testing services in 1982, now 
operates 25 major clinical testing sites in the United States. The company's 
combined laboratory services revenue for 1993 was $1.3 billion -- more than 30% 
of its $4 billion in total revenue.

ARTICLE ACCUSES RETAILER OF ETHICAL LAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an article that caused a furor long before its publication, a magazine has 
accused the Body Shop of trying to sell moldy eye gel, fabricating the exotic 
origins of some toiletries and other ethical lapses. 
</P>
<P>
 An early draft of the article published Thursday in Business Ethics magazine 
recently led a U.S. ethical investment fund to unload 50,000 shares of the 
British-based company. Speculation about the accusations has led company stock 
to plunge in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 The article by free-lancer Jon Entine says that company founder Anita 
Roddick's first business partner, cosmetologist Mark Constantine, and Janis 
Raven, a public relations expert, say the company made up stories about its 
products: cocoa butter inspired by Hawaiian natives, peppermint foot lotion 
mixed on request of the London Marathon, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 The article also claimed that franchisees around the world had problems 
getting the Body Shop to take back spoiled products, such as moldy Elderflower 
Eye Gel reported by former Asian head franchisee Anne Downer. 
</P>
<P>
 A company official wrote Downer that the product, though moldy, was unaffected 
and still safe for use, according to the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Body Shop issued a statement Thursday calling the piece "recycled 
rubbish," a "mishmash of defamatory and actionable falsehoods" and said it will 
defend its reputation and is reviewing its legal position. 
</P>
<P>
 The Body Shop has had its defenders, including Ralph Nader and Ben Cohen of 
ice cream company Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc. Nader said Entine has 
"inclinations toward fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen resigned from Business Ethics' editorial advisory board after 
threatening to do so if the article was published. 
</P>
<P>
 The furor erupted two weeks ago when the Financial Times newspaper reported 
that the U.S. ethical investment fund Franklin Research & Development Corp. 
unloaded 50,000 shares of Body Shop stock amid concerns that upcoming criticism 
of the company would hammer the share price. 
</P>
<P>
 The story said Franklin Research's decision was based on information it saw in 
a draft of the magazine article. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior vice president of Franklin Research, Patrick McVeigh, later said in a 
letter to the Financial Times that although his group was researching a report 
on the company's ethical performance, it may buy back stock later. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares in London rose 12 cents on Thursday to close at $3.36, but they 
remained below the price of $3.63 they commanded about the time the British 
news coverage began.

FEDERAL AGENCY PROPOSES REGULATIONS FOR DERIVATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal agency that regulates national banks is proposing new rules 
requiring that these financial institutions put aside more cash to cover 
potential losses on long-term derivatives contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comptroller of the Currency is to publish the proposed regulations today 
in the Federal Register, opening up the changes to public debate through Oct. 
21. The rules are similar to those proposed by the Federal Reserve Board, the 
agency that regulates bank holding companies and state-chartered banks that are 
members of its system. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives are securities whose returns are tied to the value of one or more 
assets, such as stocks, bonds, interest rates or currencies, or indexes based 
on their value. They tend to be extremely volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Comptroller of the Currency and the Fed would require banks to 
increase their capital requirements for derivatives contracts of five years or 
more that are tied to equities, precious metals and commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules would amend the Basel Accord passed in July, which regulates 
contracts tied to interest rates and foreign exchanges. "If banks do experience 
losses, they have a larger cushion to fall back on," said Janis Smith, a 
spokeswoman for the Comptroller of the Currency. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Bankers Assn. does not oppose the rules, because few banks are 
active in the long-term derivatives contracts, ABA spokeswoman Stephanie Mullin 
said. "The overall effect on banks under the new rules will be limited," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some banks recently have voluntarily infused millions of dollars into 
short-term derivatives contracts that have been included in mutual funds sold 
to investors.  
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Fleet Financial Group a week ago announced it would inject $5 
million into its money market funds to prevent investor losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Several bills aimed at regulating derivatives contracts have been introduced 
in Congress, including one by the House Banking Committee Chairman Henry 
Gonzalez (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's committee says that although the proposed regulations are a step in 
the right direction, the industry still needs legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although derivatives are highly volatile and at times risky, in the pursuit 
of profit, banks may choose to downplay the risks involved," Gonzalez said. 
"Regulators, bending to their banking constituencies, might also be convinced 
to cut regulatory corners."

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: A COLLISION OVER CAR RENTAL FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Labor Day weekend gets under way, a consumer organization is sounding 
the alarm about fees that can increase the cost of renting a car. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Interest Research Group released a survey Thursday 
showing that rental car companies in Los Angeles charge an average of $8.99 a 
day for a collision damage waiver, a fee consumers pay to protect themselves 
from liability for damage to the car. CalPIRG said payment of the fee increases 
car rental costs by an average of 42%. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer organizations have long criticized the collision damage waivers, 
saying consumers often feel pressured to buy protection they may already have. 
Many personal auto insurance policies cover damage to rental cars. In addition, 
American Express and "gold" versions of many MasterCard and Visa credit cards 
provide insurance for rental cars. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPIRG said its survey consisted of 229 phone calls to eight rental car 
companies in 29 cities, including Los Angeles. When asked about liability for 
damage, agents quoted the waiver fee. Only half the agents advised callers that 
they may already be covered by their own insurance or credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means that half of all consumers will continue to arrive at the rental 
counter without having had an opportunity to determine if they need the 
coverage at all," CalPIRG said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Armstrong, executive director of the American Car Rental Assn., said 
rental car companies aren't hiding anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Telephone sales agents can't sit there and discuss individual insurance 
needs," she said. "These reservation lines aren't set up to handle 20-minute 
conversations." 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, a spokesman for Alamo Rent A Car said the company takes "extreme 
issue" with the public interest group's statements that the waiver "is a 
'hidden add-on' sold in a 'deceptive' manner and is 'worthless.' " The 
collision damage waiver "is a viable option for millions of renters 
industrywide each year, particularly for the nearly 40% of travelers who are 
uninsured or underinsured," Alamo Vice President Roger J. Bingham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget Rent A Car said it is very open with customers about the waiver and 
that its reservation agents do not discuss the waiver over the phone because it 
is optional. The company said counter workers outline all available options at 
the time of rental. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPIRG says collision damage waivers have been banned in Illinois and New 
York for about five years. 
</P>
<P>
 New car defects: Here's another survey for new car buyers to consider. The 
Florida attorney general's office has ranked cars according to the number of 
consumer complaints about auto "lemons" from January, 1992, to March, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The results show General Motors' Oldsmobile cars generally had the fewest 
chronic defects. The model with the fewest defects overall was the Lexus SC 
300/400, made by Toyota. The lowest-ranking car was Porsche (see chart). 
</P>
<P>
 The survey covers more than 8,500 consumer reports of chronic defects 
involving 36 vehicle makes, 215 models and 20 manufacturers. The figures were 
adjusted for sales within Florida to develop the rankings. Florida regulators 
said there was no overall difference in the quality of cars produced by U.S. 
and Japanese manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 What flavor is your phone bill?: We suspect someone in GTE's legal department 
is spending too much time in the kitchen. In public documents filed with the 
state Public Utilities Commission, GTE likens the process of setting telephone 
rates to baking. 
</P>
<P>
 The company says the proposed tinkering with rates is the culinary equivalent 
of substituting peanut butter or white chocolate for bittersweet chocolate in a 
cake recipe. A final decision on proposed telephone rates -- which include a 
big jump in local calling charges for GTE customers -- is expected Sept. 15. 
Auto Defect Complaints 
</P>
<P>
 Florida regulators have ranked 36 auto makes according to complaints received 
from consumers about chronic defects. The complaints are adjusted for vehicle 
sales to determine a defect rate. A partial list, ranked from best to worst: 
02,06,15 Rank Make 1 Oldsmobile 2 Buick 3 Toyota 4 Lexus 5 Cadillac 32 BMW 33

 Biomerica Inc.: The medical diagnostic products maker Thursday restated 
results for its latest fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in Newport Beach, said it earned $56,491, rather than 
having the previously reported loss of $82,253. The company said the revision 
was because of an accounting change. 
</P>
<P>
 The change means that, for the fiscal year ended May 31, the company's 
shareholders earned 1 cent a share. For the previous fiscal year, Biomerica 
reported a loss of $435,244.

 Odds and ends: The National Cattlemen's Assn. says Americans will eat 52 
million pounds of beef on Labor Day, the second-biggest beef-eating day after 
Independence Day.That's equivalent in weight to 2,000 school buses. . . . Los 
Angeles is the fourth-leading destination for domestic business travel this 
year, according to management consultants Runzheimer International. The city 
tied with New York for second place in 1992, the last time the survey was 
conducted. The leading destination in both years was Chicago, according to 345 
travel managers surveyed.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND CHUCK PHILIPS: COMPANY TOWN; WHAT PAY BECOMES A 
LEGEND MOST?

<P>
 While media titan Time Warner Inc. talks merger with General Electric's NBC 
unit in New York, in another part of town music industry legend Clive Davis is 
trying to keep himself merged with Arista Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Davis is asking for a hefty pay raise from Arista's parent 
company, Bertelsmann Music Group, in return for extending his contract. Both 
sides are predicting a successful resolution, even though conservative BMG was 
reportedly shocked by Davis' initial demands. 
</P>
<P>
 One report has the Arista founder seeking $100 million over five years as 
compensation for cultivating such monster acts as Whitney Houston, Kenny G, 
Alan Jackson and Ace of Base. Sources close to Davis call the $100-million 
figure outrageous, but admit he's after very generous terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis brings considerable leverage to the bargaining table. Arista, which was 
acquired by BMG in 1979, is valued at more than $600 million and is considered 
the crown jewel in an otherwise lackluster family of U.S.-based record labels 
owned by the German media conglomerate. The label posted record-setting sales 
of $250 million to $300 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, according to 
published estimates, and a 12% to 15% increase in profit. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, Davis is credited with securing Tim DuBois to beef up Arista's 
Nashville division and with bringing into the BMG fold two hot companies: La 
Face Records, run by producers LA Reid and Babyface, and Clive Calder's Jive 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no grousing," said one BMG executive. "He's done a wonderful job." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At 60, those accomplishments seem to put Davis in a significantly stronger 
career position than many of his famous contemporaries. Fellow legend Mo Ostin 
is stepping down from Warner Bros. Records at the end of the year, and 
Elektra's Robert Krasnow and Capitol's Joe Smith have already left their posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys Allen Grubman and Joel Katz, who represent Davis, declined to 
comment on the negotiations, though Grubman was quick to wax eloquent on behalf 
of his client. "Clive is the definitive executive-artistic genius in the modern 
record business," Grubman said. "And he's getting better as time goes by. He 
should change his name to Clive Lafitte Rothschild." 
</P>
<P>
 Renewing Davis' contract could be just one in a series of moves to shore up 
BMG in the U.S. The company, which ranks third in domestic market share 
year-to-date with 13.46%, is still on the hunt for a North American operations 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the leading prospects for the job, which BMG hopes to fill by the end of 
month, are IRS Records President Jay Boberg and Strauss Zelnick, CEO at game 
developer Crystal Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
 BMG Chairman Michael Dornemann declined to comment on the search. But sources 
say Davis is not interested in the job because he prefers the hands-on role at 
Arista. Others said to have rejected the post are Krasnow, MTV Chairman Tom 
Freston and Columbia Records chief Don Ienner. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornemann is also on the hunt for a new chairman of RCA, the venerable label 
it acquired from General Electric for $330 million in 1986. Joe Galante, its 
third president in eight years, is returning to RCA's Nashville office after 
failing to make a success of the label. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Kovach, who manages Meat Loaf and John Mellencamp, has been mentioned as 
a possible candidate, but rumors this week focused on Ron Fair, senior vice 
president of artists and repertoire and staff producer at RCA, who was credited 
with the successful soundtrack for "Reality Bites." Capitol Records executive 
Lou Mann is said to have turned down an offer for the No. 2 post at RCA. 
</P>
<P>
 In another area, BMG is rumored to be close to announcing a foreign 
distribution agreement with Rick Rubin's American Recordings. Rubin, whose acts 
include Johnny Cash and the Black Crowes, began talks with BMG after a bitter 
dispute broke out with London-based Phonogram. 
</P>
<P>
 In two lawsuits, American has charged that Phonogram breached its contractual 
obligations to pay royalties, file tax returns and establish offices for 
American. An attorney for American also argued in British court that Phonogram, 
a division of media giant PolyGram, is a "shell company." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is $6 million missing from the Phonogram/Def American joint venture 
account," said Mike Bone, head of retail marketing and international at 
American Recordings. "I can think of no reason why we would want to have any 
business relationship with people who have such questionable business ethics." 
</P>
<P>
 Phonogram -- which also distributes the music of Elton John, Metallica, Def 
Leppard and Dire Straits -- dropped a legal injunction last week to stop 
American from defecting. It characterized the allegations on Thursday as 
"ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives for Dire Straits and other rock acts distributed by Phonogram 
said they are pleased with the company and baffled by American Recording's 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working with this firm for many years and have never once 
encountered a money problem," Dire Straits manager Ed Bicknell said in an 
interview from London. "Phonogram has always been fair, accurate and meticulous 
in their dealings with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hailing a job: The other news in music circles is that former Capitol Records 
President Hale Milgrim may soon be re-employed. Sources say Elektra and 
Columbia are both in discussions with Milgrim over high-level jobs.

 * TV: Financially strapped Interactive Network Inc. is getting some breathing 
room. Its strategic partners, including Tele-Communications Inc., NBC and new 
partner Motorola Inc., agreed to provide $50 million in new debt and equity 
financing.The San Jose company, which develops interactive television 
programming, said one part of the deal involves having TCI, NBC and Motorola 
provide about $20 million as a secured loan that can be converted into new 
Interactive preferred shares at $4 a share. The $20-million loan includes $1 
million received Thursday -- $500,000 from TCI and $250,000 each from NBC and 
Motorola. It also includes about $3.5 million that TCI previously advanced and 
another $250,000 from NBC. In documents filed Aug. 16 with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Interactive Network said it needed more money to support 
its operations and expand into additional markets, saying that "failure to 
obtain additional financing would require the company to significantly curtail 
or cease its operations." In exchange for joining as a partner, Motorola gets 
the rights to making hardware based on the company's technology.

EXECUTIVE SUITE: COMPANY TOWN; SOURCES CONFIRM PEARLSTINE MOVE TO TIME WARNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Wall Street Journal executive editor Norman Pearlstine is in line to 
become the next editor in chief at Time Warner Inc., company sources confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The public announcement won't be made until after the media conglomerate's 
board of directors considers the hiring later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with Time tradition, Pearlstine's predecessor, Jason McManus, is 
expected to recommend Pearlstine for the job to the company directors. McManus 
plans to retire soon, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearlstine would oversee magazines such as Time, Entertainment Weekly, People, 
Fortune and Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 He presided over the Journal's rapid expansion during the 1980s and left the 
newspaper in 1992. Most recently he has headed Friday Holdings, the media 
investment company he founded with financial backing from QVC Inc. and 
Paramount Communications Inc. and named for his wife, author Nancy Friday. The 
Journal article that first reported the Pearlstine move this week also said he 
was working to dismantle the investment company partnership.

THE SCENE: TUNING IN TO FREE FUN; IF YOU'RE UNDER 21 AND ON A BUDGET, FINDING A 
NIGHTCLUB WITH GOOD LIVE MUSIC CAN BE A PAIN. BUT CHECK OUT STORES, CAMPUSES -- 
AND 'ANTI-MALLS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ages 13 to 17 1/2 will always be among my favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 My friends and I would hit a minimum of a dozen live music shows a month, a 
feat managed by keeping my parents happy and sneaking REMs whenever no one was 
looking. To maintain my GPA, I finished my homework long after curfew. I got 
extra cash working odd jobs. No work could have been more odd, either: selling 
green glowing necklaces at the Old World Oktoberfest or being a ballroom dance 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although we occasionally attended the mega-concerts with the mega ticket 
prices, we fancied the nightclub shows for regular consumption. Nothing 
duplicates the experience of a live gig up close and personal. And no nightclub 
stood too far. Hollywood, San Diego, Corona and all points of Orange County 
were within our tireless reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, today's teens have been virtually written off by nightclubs. Sure, a 
hall here and a coffeehouse there will hold an all-ages show, but they increase 
the cover by 40% to 60% to make up for the loss of bar profits. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's a young fan of live music with a limited budget to do? 
</P>
<P>
 You can hit one of the free concerts held at college campuses, alternative 
record stores, funky clothes boutiques, or sources such as the Lab "anti-mall" 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 In-store concerts (or those held just outside the door) enable folks of all 
ages to check out an act before pledging a penny for a paid show or a 
recording. In turn, bands receive exposure and new fans. Increasingly, these 
events are turning into spontaneous scenes for the young masses, where 
friendships are forged, potential mates are discovered, intellectual and 
fashion ideas are exchanged. (Oh, yeah, and followings are cultivated.) 
</P>
<P>
 Juniors Anna Sacramento and Elise Irving of El Modeno High in Orange are live 
music junkies. They've met most of their friends at free concerts, as well as 
paid gigs, and have become tighter with existing pals who share their 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten to be friends with a lot of bands," says Anna, whose fuzzy shorn 
head contrasts with her sweet doll face. "You just see the same people at the 
shows all the time and eventually you talk to each other. It's really cool." 
</P>
<P>
 The two 16-year-olds raved to local ska favorites the Goodwin Club at the Lab 
on Saturday along with a crowd of about 50 that ranged from a toddler to a 
rockin' grandma. They invaded the outdoor "living room" of the Lab, standing 
around the pool table and eclectic furniture, flopping down on plush couches, 
sitting cross-legged on the Oriental rugs spread out over the smooth concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 This is part of the treat about these free shows: the opportunity to turn a 
retail space into a part of the community. At record stores, independent or 
chain, patrons sit on the floor using compact disc racks as a backrest and 
crowd the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
 To the more charged tunes, Anna and Elise joined the daffy dozen front and 
center who swayed, jumped and rolled on their backs with feet in the air all in 
unison. Their leader was a green-haired guy in a matching green Hawaiian shirt 
who intermittently broke out in a spastic interpretation of a Richard Simmons' 
workout, donkey leg lifts included. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The site jived with what one twentysomething member of the audience noted the 
day before at a free concert with Supernovice at the Virgin Megastore in Costa 
Mesa: "Younger fans get more excited, they show their enjoyment, while older 
folks act like they're too cool to dance or scream." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there floated an aura of cool at Virgin during the 40-minute punk show. 
Heads waved, and those seated up the wide stairway stomped their booted feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin has featured a regular run of bands, mostly of the punk and alternative 
variety and mostly local. The store has also presented acts such as Green Day 
when it was on the brink of becoming a MTV staple. 
</P>
<P>
 It's these types of bands that have actively sought out a following from day 
one with demo tapes recorded at home or at burgeoning independent record 
labels. (Orange County is home to countless such melody-makers.) The packaging 
-- if not the recordings -- are crude at times. They're sold for $2 to $5 in 
hopes of landing in someone's tape player. 
</P>
<P>
 But all too often, those bands that end up in constant rotation on some kid's 
Walkman find few opportunities to play live for their younger fans. Flyers are 
handed to teens advertising shows they're too young to attend and end up as 
wallpaper in their bedrooms or as recycling fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get these flyers, and it's really aggravating because they end up being 
for clubs that are over 21," says Fountain Valley High junior Marla Unruh, 15. 
</P>
<P>
 At least she and her best friend, Aileen Holmes, also a junior at FVHS, can 
count on one free show a week somewhere. In the warmer months, there are three 
or more. They usually happen after school, on weekend afternoons and less 
frequently on a Friday evening. Fans walk, bike, skateboard or hitch a ride 
from Mom. Marla and Aileen took the latter mode of transportation to the recent 
Goodwin Club and Supernovice shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Aileen, 15, usually learns about such shows from college radio. A poet and 
bassist, she believes more clubs should take a chance with all-age shows, 
providing they're strict with drinking laws.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be more open-minded about music," she says about her fellow 
high-schoolers. "The media tell us what's in. But we should be able to decide 
for ourselves. There are local bands that will never get airplay. We should 
have the option of knowing about these bands so we can decide for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Elise of El Modeno offers other reasons: "Parties suck, movies are expensive, 
coffeehouses get boring. Live music is very important; it's everything." 
</P>
<P>
 And she insists teens need more free shows, if not cheaper covers. "It gets 
old rolling pennies every weekend." 
</P>

high schoolers.

THE KING OF CONTROVERSY; ONCE, WILLIAM KUNSTLER EPITOMIZED MOVEMENT LAWYERS: 
FIGHTING FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, AGAINST VIETNAM. HE HASN'T CHANGED MUCH SINCE THEN. 
BUT HIS CLIENTS HAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH GETLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As he drove down a darkened highway into Manhattan one night, William M. 
Kunstler clicked on the radio and learned that he was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The body of famed radical attorney William Kunstler was found in his home 
this afternoon, an apparent suicide," the announcer said. "We'll be gathering 
reaction from the political world as this story develops." 
</P>
<P>
 Intrigued, Kunstler turned up the volume and heard more details of his life 
and untimely death. The report was only corrected hours later, with the news 
that one of his nephews with the same name had killed himself instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they were guilty of wishful thinking," Kunstler cracks, recalling the 
bizarre 1976 broadcast. "Some folks don't hide it very well." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the first or last time that America's most prominent left-wing 
lawyer has been written off for dead. For years, his bushy sideburns and 
abrasive politics have seemed as dated as the 1960s themselves, his flamboyant 
courtroom style a throwback to earlier, more innocent times. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Kunstler was the king of movement lawyers. Brash, self-serving and often 
brilliant, he epitomized a generation of white, middle-class attorneys who 
raised hell over civil rights, police brutality and the Vietnam War. Best known 
for his role in the Chicago Seven conspiracy trial of 1969, Kunstler joined 
with such lawyers as Charles Garry, Gerald Lefcourt, Leonard Weinglass and 
Ramsey Clark in a saber-rattling crusade against Fortress Amerika. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 75, Kunstler hasn't changed much. But his clients have. He used to 
represent people like Abbie Hoffman and Tom Hayden -- radicals with national 
followings -- yet lately he's become the pariah's attorney of choice. A man who 
turns terrorists, rapists and murderers into political causes celebres.  
</P>
<P>
 It's brought him new life in the '90s, as well as scathing criticism. Indeed, 
Vanity Fair dubbed him "The Most Hated Lawyer in America," and there's no 
shortage of pundits who call him a hypocrite. But Kunstler couldn't care less. 
</P>
<P>
 "My agenda is the same as 25 years ago," he insists. "It's just that these are 
rougher times and the folks I deal with now aren't the same." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Kunstler has handled clients ranging from El Sayyid Nosair -- 
the man accused of murdering Rabbi Meir Kahane -- to Larry Davis, a black man 
charged with killing four men and wounding six New York cops. He defended Yusef 
Salaam, one of several youths who participated in the rape and attack on the 
Central Park jogger, and he represented mob killer John Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, he'll defend Colin Ferguson, a Jamaican immigrant who killed six 
people and wounded 19 in a wild shooting spree on the Long Island Railroad. 
Kunstler plans an insanity defense and has sparked a national controversy by 
suggesting that "black rage" triggered Ferguson's attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since the Chicago trial, I realized that America's criminal justice 
system is bankrupt," says Kunstler, his trademark bifocals perched on a mane of 
unruly hair. "My focus is on people who can least defend themselves. On African 
Americans, on followers of Islam, who are on the margins of society. These 
folks have a constitutional right to a lawyer like anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, he represented three of 13 men charged with plotting to blow 
up the United Nations and other New York City landmarks. Sheik Omar 
Abdel-Rahman -- the alleged ringleader -- has sought his services, as have 
three of the four Muslims convicted earlier this year of bombing the World 
Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York conspiracy trial might have given him his biggest platform yet. 
But U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey removed Kunstler's law firm from the 
case last week, citing a conflict of interest. Two defendants he once 
represented in the matter now have different attorneys, Mukasey ruled, and it 
would be ethically difficult for the lawyer to cross-examine them as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunstler, who expected the decision, blasted Mukasey for caving in to 
government pressure, adding: "The state has wanted to kick our asses off this 
case so bad, they could taste it. They just can't keep up with me." 
</P>
<P>
 He's come a long way from his days as a quiet suburban attorney, and Kunstler 
celebrates the odyssey in "My Life as a Radical Lawyer" (Birch Lane Press), a 
provocative new autobiography. As he sees it, there's an ideological line 
running from the streets of Chicago in 1969 to the wreckage of the World Trade 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument baffles many friends, who view Kunstler's evolution with dismay. 
Yet they seem just as concerned for the future of progressive politics. What 
happened to him, in a sense, reflects the lack of direction on the American 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a mirror of the times, because the '60s was an era of hope and change," 
says Lynn Stewart, an attorney who's worked with Kunstler. "As that disappears 
you get involved with things that aren't as pure. You make excuses and see 
political righteousness in cases where it's not quite so clear." 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't made him rich. Kunstler could have cashed in on his celebrity but 
instead earns $100,000 annually, working out of an office in his Greenwich 
Village home. Along with Ron Kuby, a ponytailed 37-year-old disciple, he 
handles many cases pro bono and only rarely takes on cash-rich clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no need to say, 'Who is Mr. Kunstler?' " wrote Mohammed Salameh, one 
of four men convicted of bombing the World Trade Center, in a letter to the 
U.S. Court of Appeals asking that Kunstler be named his lawyer. "He is as a 
mountain on the ground. I think all lawyers are kids compared to him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Outside New York City, however, Kunstler has fallen off the media radar 
screen. These days, some folks are amazed he's even alive when they run into 
him, reacting as if they'd seen a ghost. Tall, garrulous and still bristling 
with indignation, he remains every prosecutor's worst nightmare: a 
smooth-talking lefty who gets maximum press for his political clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Kunstler has never been effective by the standards of the Harvard Law 
Review," says Norman Dorsen, former chief of the American Civil Liberties 
Union. "He's been very effective, however, as a radical lawyer. You just want 
to tell him that it's not 1969 anymore. People can't live in a time warp." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it's unavoidable, when his very name conjures up a trip down memory lane: 
To the South, where he bailed out freedom riders. To Chicago, where his seven 
clients were acquitted of conspiring to disrupt the 1968 Democratic convention. 
To Attica, where he counseled inmates during the 1971 uprising. To Wounded 
Knee, where he joined Native Americans in a tense standoff with FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends and clients in those years read like a Who's Who of change and 
upheaval, including Lenny Bruce, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Stokley 
Carmichael, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the Berrigan Brothers and Jack Ruby. Even 
his worst enemies concede Kunstler's place in the history books. 
</P>
<P>
 But he can never get enough recognition. By his own admission, the aging 
lawyer has an insatiable craving for approval, even from strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "How did I do?" he asks a frail woman in a wheelchair, who's just heard him 
talk about crime prevention at a Connecticut event. "Was I OK today?" Seconds 
later, he asks the same question of other startled listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Narcissism is an occupational disease among lawyers. Yet Kunstler has a 
conflicting impulse as well -- an instinct for controversy that offends many. 
The two spirits have been at war in him for years, with disastrous results. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an odd hunger in him," says ACLU colleague Henry Schwarzchild. "I 
don't think Bill has any ideology as such. But he has a powerful need to make 
waves, to constantly get in your face. And he pays the price." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1980, Kunstler has received a stream of death threats and obscene calls. 
Gunman have fired at his office and demonstrators have marched in front of his 
home. He's been beaten up, jailed and cited by judges for contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, friends wonder why he bothers. Kunstler is a cultured man who writes 
sonnets in his spare time and brings his wife breakfast in bed. He has two 
teen-age daughters from a second marriage, a busy lecture schedule and a film 
career with credits in movies by Oliver Stone, Spike Lee and Ron Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 Shouldn't he begin to close down the office early and relax? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to say goodby," says a New York State Supreme Court judge, who 
dismisses Kunstler as an anachronism. New York Daily News columnist Jim Sleeper 
calls him a "public fraud" over the Ferguson case, and Bronx Dist. Atty. Paul 
Gentile attacks him as a racist for excluding whites from criminal juries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man ran out of causes a long time ago," says attorney Alan Dershowitz, a 
frequent critic. "And he's veered into dubious areas." 
</P>
<P>
 As the attacks mount, friends stress Kunstler's integrity. Gerald Lefcourt, 
once a prominent left-wing attorney and now a criminal defense lawyer, says his 
colleague had it easier 30 years ago, when the issues were simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was doing God's work," Lefcourt says. "It was important." 
</P>
<P>
 But memories are short. Some Jewish critics suggest that Kunstler, who is 
Jewish, has deliberately sought out Muslim terrorists as clients. They're angry 
that he got Nosair acquitted in the 1990 murder of Meir Kahane, suggesting he 
couldn't possibly believe his client was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen," Kunstler snaps, "they called me a nigger-lover down south when I 
worked with civil rights activists, and now up north they call me a self-hating 
Jew. Believe me, this is one Jew who loves himself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On that much, most agree. Kunstler's vanity is legendary, and it fills the 
chapters of his new book. For 609 pages, the author lets his enemies have it. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls Dershowitz reprehensible for representing Leona Helmsley, and 
criticizes John and Robert Kennedy as power-mad, saying their deaths were in 
some ways good for the country. Angered that Marlon Brando removed him from the 
legal team defending his son, Christian, Kunstler ridicules the Los Angeles 
attorney who replaced him -- Robert Shapiro, now representing O.J. Simpson -- 
as "a wheeler-dealer . . . not really a trial lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond gossip, the book relates Kunstler's own story in rich detail. Born into 
a family of doctors, he grew up in Manhattan, the oldest of three children. 
Unlike his quieter siblings, he was always the extrovert. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellingly, the rebellious boy tried to befriend blacks, but was forbidden by 
his parents. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Yale, won the Bronze Star in 
World War II and got a law degree from Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1948, Kunstler had married Lotte Rosenberger, a childhood flame, and the 
couple had two daughters. Soon, he formed a law practice with his brother, 
Michael, and the two made a living handling wills and estates. 
</P>
<P>
 It all changed in 1961, when an ACLU friend asked Kunstler to stop in Jackson, 
Miss., on his way home from a Los Angeles trip. Civil rights protests were 
erupting, and the Freedom Riders -- a group of activists trying to integrate 
bus systems in the Deep South -- were being sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunstler went to offer moral support. But he stayed longer than expected, 
rocked by his encounter with racism. He drifted away from his law practice and 
became more politically involved. Eventually, Kunstler served as counsel to Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr., and he helped form the Center for Constitutional 
Rights, a pioneering advocacy group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 His star was rising, but the Chicago Seven case put him on the map. When 
prosecutors failed to win a conspiracy conviction, Kunstler got much of the 
media credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine a trial where one defendant is gagged, another hurls Yiddish curses at 
the judge and the prosecutor attacks his rivals as homosexuals. It happened in 
Chicago, after Kunstler and others turned the proceedings into political 
theater. When the dust settled, there were contempt sentences for all, 
including a four-year prison penalty for Kunstler. He was later cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill's always shown great courage," says attorney Leonard Weinglass, who 
worked with Kunstler on the Chicago trial. "And when you think that he was once 
a Hubert Humphrey liberal who dabbled in politics, the change is amazing. His 
cases are the stuff of history." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kunstler's autobiography lists them all, but its most revealing passages focus 
on his personal life. With painful honesty, he recounts the sexual infidelities 
that led to the breakup of his first marriage in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young women pursued me, most likely because I was something of a celebrity 
and, the more well known I became, the more aggressive the woman got," he 
writes. "For someone with my vanity and ego, it was gratifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Kunstler married his second wife, attorney Margaret Ratner, in 1975. He speaks 
effusively about her, saying she has made him more considerate. Asked about his 
first wife, Kunstler says he and Lotte have "a very decent relationship." She, 
however, offers a different view. 
</P>
<P>
 "His belligerence on behalf of what he believes is sincere," the former Mrs. 
Kunstler suggests. "But it's also exaggerated, because he wants to impress 
people, too. . . . He has this incredible need to be understood and liked. And 
I don't think he's all that mature at 75. That part of him is suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 So is his memory. In her introduction to Kunstler's book, co-writer Sheila 
Isenberg says the lawyer told her stories about himself that turned out to be 
untrue. In many cases, she adds, "he is the principal embellisher of his own 
myth." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 on a cool Monday morning, Kunstler is heading for Hartford, Conn. It's 
Law Day and the man who has been slapped with more contempt citations than he 
cares to remember will be a featured speaker before 22 judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you believe this?" he mutters outside his office. "It's kind of strange. 
But if they want me, they want me." 
</P>
<P>
 They want him at 10 a.m. sharp, and Kunstler is known for being late. This 
morning he wants to be on time and his chariot awaits -- a beat-up van with a 
canoe on top that looks like a hippie bus from 1967. Inside, it's a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, a young law student and ardent Irish Republican Army sympathizer, 
has a bumper sticker taped to the roof that reads: "Strip Search the Queen." 
Almost immediately, Kunstler starts yakking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will you get to the goddamned point!" he barks, as the driver tries to cut in 
with a long, complicated joke. "We don't have a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Not when Kunstler wants the floor. Seizing an opening, he starts a daylong, 
stream-of-consciousness rap that's almost impossible to interrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins with the Patty Hearst case, which Kunstler brings up for no apparent 
reason, then skips to the time he hugged Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun. 
Digressing altogether, Kunstler recalls a dinner with John Gotti and then 
describes the girls he made love to during a 1936 trip to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 As the van chugs into suburban Westchester County, he complains about his 
former home, saying: "Not one black person lived in my town. It was unreal." 
</P>
<P>
 When his van reaches the Hartford courthouse, Kunstler is greeted by John 
Brittain, a black law professor. He recalls how the New York lawyer helped bail 
out Freedom Riders. Long before most whites discovered civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill is special," Brittain says, hugging him. "We don't forget." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Kunstler sits on a dais in a courtroom. It's a bizarre sight that 
grows more incongruous when 22 black-robed judges file in, solemnly nodding at 
the long-haired lawyer. Amazed, he nods back. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one here should dispute this man's commitment to justice, even though we 
may not agree with him," says Matthew Gordon, a local lawyer who helped select 
Kunstler as the day's speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Casing the crowd, Kunstler gives them a polite tongue-lashing. He notes that 
Law Day is a counterpoint to May Day in socialist countries. Then he blasts 
corrupt officials -- including judges -- who "set up" innocent blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I've ever been in a room with so many judges without wanting to 
hide," he jokes. "But it's OK, I can get out of here fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Kunstler rushes out of the courthouse when the speech is over, heading for his 
next appointment 50 miles up the road. He's representing Moonface Bear, the 
Golden Hill Paugeesukq tribal chief, who is battling state officials over the 
right to sell cigarettes tax-free on a reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait!" says Gordon, running up to Kunstler. "Can I come too?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's a painful moment: Gordon, a middle-aged lawyer with a '60s hangover, 
would like nothing more than to climb into Kunstler's magic bus. He'll call his 
secretary. He'll clear his schedule. He'll get to touch Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I could follow you . . , " he says, his voice trailing off. "Or maybe 
we can do it next time." The two shake hands and Kunstler's van rolls north. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost in thought, he begins shuffling anxiously through legal papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now what the hell are we doing up there on the reservation today?" he 
grumbles to himself. "I don't really know what the program is yet." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a recurring complaint about Kunstler. During the conspiracy trial, 
critics say, his rhetoric was compelling, but he didn't do his legal homework. 
The lawyer remembers it differently, and his war stories are surreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the time he called Paul Krassner, editor of the Realist, to the stand. 
Unbeknown to the defense team, the witness had taken a megadose of LSD before 
appearing. Here's how Kunstler describes the encounter: 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell the jury when you came to Chicago in 1968," he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born in Albany," Krassner answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Perplexed, Kunstler asked: "What did you do in Chicago?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on the high school football team," Krassner responded. 
</P>
<P>
 By now spectators were stirring. Kunstler asked a final question: "When did 
you leave Chicago?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I told you, I was on the football team," Krassner answered. 
</P>
<P>
 At this, Abbie Hoffman whispered: "He's freaked out! Sit him down!" 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking quickly, Kunstler slammed his hand down on the lectern and boomed: 
"Thank you, Mr. Krassner! No further questions!" As if his witness had 
delivered the most damning testimony in the trial. The prosecution team, which 
hadn't been paying attention, impatiently waved Krassner off the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a great story. Except it's not quite true. 
</P>
<P>
 In his memoirs, Krassner admits taking LSD, yet recalls a completely different 
exchange. The official transcript provides a third version. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are details," says Kunstler, asked about the discrepancies. "I mean, 
the man was stoned out of his mind. That's all you need to know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With a shudder, the van comes to a halt on a dirt road in rural Connecticut. 
Easing his big frame out, Kunstler greets Moonface Bear, an unsmiling, solidly 
built man who welcomes him to the small reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wandering down a forest trail, the lawyer outlines his client's case. But then 
he's overwhelmed by the past. There had been a tense confrontation here last 
summer between Native Americans and police, he explains, and violence seemed 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place," Kunstler says, "had the smell of Attica." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1971, some 1,500 inmates at a prison in Upstate New York seized 
42 hostages, demanding improvements in living conditions. Kunstler and others 
were called in to help mediate the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 When talks stalled, state troopers stormed Attica, killing 29 inmates and 10 
civilian hostages. It was the bloodiest prison disaster in American history. 
</P>
<P>
 The memory is crystal clear. Or is it? In Kunstler's book, he recalls a 
dramatic moment when he told inmates that they weren't going to get a better 
deal than the final offer made by state negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempers flared in the prison courtyard, then subsided. In the aftermath, he 
writes, New York Times reporter Tom Wicker -- who was also called in to mediate 
-- came up to him and whispered: "Bill, you've saved all our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a great story. Except it isn't quite true. 
</P>
<P>
 Wicker never said those words because he wasn't in the courtyard at that 
moment. He was 10 miles away in a motel bar, according to his own book, "A Time 
to Die." He does, however, credit the attorney with great courage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were in danger of dying at one point," Kunstler says, heading 
for court with Moonface Bear. "That's what I remember." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Kunstler is in Manhattan federal court. He's seeking 
permission from a three-judge panel to represent three of the men convicted in 
the World Trade Center bombing. A trial judge had refused the request and 
Kunstler attacks his decision, saying: "It makes the law look like an ass." 
</P>
<P>
 After a testy hearing, the panel also denies his plea, saying Kunstler could 
face a conflict of interest between these new defendants and others he 
represents. Angered, the lawyer strides outdoors to a phalanx of TV cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States government is putting Islam on trial," he says. "We're 
going to fight them all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Three hours later, he jets to Ohio for the 24th anniversary of the shooting of 
four students at Kent State University. It's an emotional event, and Kunstler's 
eyes fill with tears when he recalls how the families still grieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never got over this," he says. "Neither did I." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's no time for nostalgia. As he speaks the next morning, Kunstler is 
in yet another courtroom, waiting for a client to be sentenced. Solomon 
Mengstie, a black Ethiopian Jew, was convicted of armed robbery and faces up to 
25 years in prison. He and others robbed two people of $9.99, but friends say 
Mengstie is a soft-spoken man who simply fell in with the wrong crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw a person who inflicted so little pain and is about to receive so 
much pain," Kunstler tells the court. "To some he's just another black man 
going in. But this system is filled with racism." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge listens impassively, then gives Mengstie 5 to 11 years. Kunstler 
makes his way out of the crowded courts building, stifling a yawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm beat," he says, suddenly looking every one of his 75 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the office, Kunstler is on the phone with Ferguson, the Long Island 
Railroad gunman. The lawyer rolls his eyes, as partner Kuby watches intently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know, Colin. . . . Listen to me . . . Colin, please," he begs, as the 
client shouts about jail conditions. Soon, Kunstler loses patience and delivers 
his message: It would be good for Ferguson to appear on "60 Minutes" in the 
fall and speak to an audience of millions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just be yourself, Colin," Kunstler says. "That's all you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuby, in a playful mood, jumps to his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, Colin," he says, spraying the room with imaginary gunfire. "Just be 
your usual wacky self." 
</P>
<P>
 It's getting late, and Kunstler steps outside for fresh air. He rubs his eyes 
and a visitor asks if he has a headache. The answer is automatic: 
</P>
<P>
 "When Charles Garry, the radical lawyer, was dying, they asked if he had a 
headache," he says. "And he said: 'I don't have headaches. I give them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kunstler laughs, but he can't steal another man's epitaph. What he has in mind 
for himself is more cinematic: A dramatic trial summation, perhaps, then a 
fatal collapse at the lectern. He'll breathe his last on the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a story!" he says, with a vainglorious grin. "Now that's an obituary I 
can live with."

BEHIND THE WHEEL: CIRRUS MAY BE CHRYSLER'S SILVER LINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chrysler's counterattack of the killer sedans is nearing completion -- with 
domestic and imported foes a little bloodied, their sales visibly bent. 
</P>
<P>
 The first salvo was fired two years ago by the Chrysler Concorde, Dodge 
Intrepid and Eagle Vision. Sales of this radically redesigned trio of quick, 
slinky, high value, mid-size four-doors brought Chrysler back from a financial 
standing usually measured in chapters. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the European styling and flat handling of Chrysler's New Yorker and 
flashier LHS gave domestic builders of full-size, $30,000 luxury sedans 
something new and extravagant to complain about. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the roomy Dodge and Plymouth Neons, with accents on performance, 
handling and maximum equipment for the buck, began loosening the lock of Honda, 
Saturn and Ford on the subcompact set. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Chrysler is ready to mop up the gravy -- the market segment just below 
mid-size, that rich niche representing 37% of new car sales. 
</P>
<P>
 And with its 1995 Cirrus -- a roomy, virile, dramatically styled small sedan 
with V-6 power, anti-lock brakes and dual air bags for less than $18,000 -- 
Chrysler may soon have Nissan Altima, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Infiniti G20, 
Pontiac Grand Am and Mazda 626 reaching for the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all a matter of more for less. Japanese car prices are rising. Quality of 
domestic cars is ascending and each year brings further proof of reliability. 
Suddenly, the reward of economic nationalism is no longer an ordinary-looking 
car of ineluctable depreciation that spends most weekends at Tuneup Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 Cirrus' fiercest competition, however, could be a car that won't be on the 
road until fall: the 1995 Ford Contour, another tight, nice-handling new 
breeder also delivering V-6 power, automatic transmission, dual air bags and 
optimum value for about $18,000 and change. 
</P>
<P>
 Both represent the continuing redirection of domestic builders toward smaller 
cars that are satisfying, quality products and great fun to drive. Once content 
with just matching the Asian competition, Chrysler and Ford now are baring 
their teeth and overtaking it. 
</P>
<P>
 So look for a Chrysler Cirrus-Ford Contour joust that in terms of bringing 
home big marbles, should duplicate the longstanding Jeep Grand Cherokee-Ford 
Explorer punch-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all sedans in Chrysler's long, steady return to contention, the Cirrus is 
a cab-forward design. That means a deep, raked windshield with a low cowl. Also 
wheels moved closer to corners of the car for the stability of a longer wheel 
base, and the more balanced look of shorter front and rear overhangs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cirrus, cab-forward creates a hood that is wider than longer. That leaves 
so little room up front, the battery is mounted inside the left front fender. 
Battery changes are possible by turning the front wheel to full lock. 
</P>
<P>
 Cab-forward also allows interior room for heads, legs and shoulders to be that 
of a mid-size car, while external dimensions are kept closer to those of a 
compact car. 
</P>
<P>
 In the real world of cramps and crushed knees, however, it all translates to 
airy front seating behind a huge windshield with planetarium visibility. The 
back seat is a small coliseum providing ample room for six-footers even with 
front seats slid to the rear. Easily best in class. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet where Cirrus butts foreheads directly with Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Mazda 
is in little touches and Chrysler's fixation with engineering thoroughness. 
Which is how Japan once led the way. 
</P>
<P>
 This car is tightly assembled from pieces that create a whole stronger and 
more compatible than a jigsaw puzzle. The suspension -- springs and tubular 
shocks, unequal length upper and lower control arms -- is overbuilt, which 
means the harder you toss the car, the better it likes it. Anti-lock disc 
brakes wouldn't fade if an elephant were doing the stomping. All of which gives 
a driver an enormous sense of security behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Those thinking touches? A tab inside the trunk that releases the rear seat 
back for long loads. An optional ashtray -- a round butt bucket that fits in a 
console cup holder for those whose addictions are nicotine before caffeine. 
</P>
<P>
 And in keeping with its evolving image, Chrysler has dumped a Pentagon logo so 
reminiscent of the joint chiefs of nuclear war. Its replacement is a 
60-year-old blue-and-gold Chrysler seal that's all wreaths, ribbons and 
retrospective charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Cirrus enters showroom service in October and will be powered by one engine, a 
2.5-liter, 164-horsepower V-6. The base LX model comes fully stuffed from air 
bags and automatic transmission, to power steering and air conditioning. About 
the only extras on the LXi -- at a coy $19,900 -- are leather seats, theft 
alarm, bigger wheels and tires, premium sound and a power driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the car will form another cloud formation as Dodge Stratus with a 
choice of three powertrains: A 2.0-liter, four-cylinder from Chrysler's Neon 
mated to a five-speed manual; a 2.4-liter four with automatic, and the 2.5 V-6 
with automatic. Plymouth will sell its cloudy version of the Cirrus-Stratus 
series next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cirri are pretty cars of advanced styling, particularly the little ducktails 
molded into the rear decks. Those who can overlook Chrysler's propensity for 
delivering upholstery and linings in any color as long as it's mouse gray will 
see interiors as equally pleasing with flashes of walnut. There's also a 
recurring ovoid theme to ventilation ports and the instrument cluster, with 
window and side mirror controls conveniently at hand in the door rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a relatively small displacement V-6, the engine pulls quite well and 
runs quickly if allowed to build momentum. It also becomes a buzzy noisemaker 
if asked to do anything dramatic and in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspension noise in our LX and LXi test cars -- all pre-production models -- 
was quite audible. This could be tuned out before assembly lines roll. The 
four-speed automatics were also inclined to surge and hunt. This might be a 
tougher fix. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the sedans. In coming months, Chrysler directs its 
counteroffensive against coupes. First with the Dodge Avenger, then the 
Chrysler Sebring, with both falling in performance, size and price between 
ancient and modern, imported and domestic: Ford's Thunderbird and Honda's 
Prelude. 
</P>
<P>
 So watch out. Take cover. Innnncoming . 1995 CHRYSLER CIRRUS LXi

 The Good: Roomy cab-forward design. Tightly engineered, all the safety stuff. 
High value, middling investment.

TECHNOWATCH: THE GOODS; WHATEVER HAPPENED TO PASSING NOTES?

<P>
 Perfect for school days is Casio's new Secret Sender 6000 Diary, an electronic 
digital diary for kids that does a lot more than store telephone numbers and 
addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret Sender 6000 is similar to last year's children's hit from Casio, My 
Magic Diary, but it has added features. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a variety of practical functions, Secret Sender also can send 
messages from one unit to another via infrared signals. And it can even 
activate a TV or VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 In its message mode, the compact diary can send 10 pre-programmed messages or 
a child's own personalized ones as far as 25 feet. Up to 10 messages of 28 
characters each can be stored, and messages and telephone directory data can be 
recalled from the unit's memory and sent just by touching a button. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit's display features four lines of 16 characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Intended for children 8 through 13, Secret Sender's phone directory also has a 
"Fun Face Maker" that allows kids to create funny faces to accompany friends' 
phone numbers. Addresses, birthdays and other important dates also can be 
stored. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit keeps time, too, displaying the time in 29 time zones on a scrolling 
world map. A calendar with cartoon pictures for sports, homework, hobbies and 
the like reminds the child on what day and time a specific activity is planned, 
and has a schedule alarm (in addition to a daily alarm) so he or she won't be 
late. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Secret Password" function permits the child to put in private information 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there's a 10-digit calculator with memory, square root and 
percentage functions, and a currency converter that allows the user to compare 
the value of six foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 For fun there are "Fortune Telling" and "Match Maker" features. Punch in your 
birthday and you get your fortune for the day, every day. Match Maker can give 
advice about getting along with a special someone. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightweight -- 4.9 ounces -- Secret Sender 6000 ($119.95) comes with a 2,000- 
to 7,000-hour main battery and a three-year memory backup battery. 
</P>
<P>
 It is available at Target, Toys R Us, Good Guys and Fedco. If you can't find 
it in your area, call (800) YO-CASIO. Now You Can Draw and Sniff 
</P>
<P>
 Even crayons have gone high-tech this fall. Crayola is out with Magic Scent 
Crayons that feature "micro-encapsulated" fragrances in the nontoxic crayons. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 16 food and nature fragrances -- orange, lemon, banana, chocolate, 
strawberry, blueberry, cherry, spearmint, lime, licorice, grape, coconut, 
bubble gum, rose, pine and a fresh air scent -- and they smell quite realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not too likely kids would eat the fragrant crayons, because they don't 
smell unless you draw with them or scratch the surface of the crayon. But 
Binney & Smith, makers of Crayola crayons, has had them tested by toxicologists 
and an independent safety specialist to assure their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 After evaluating the scented crayons, Dorothy Drago, the specialist who was 
formerly with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said they "pose no 
greater potential for ingestion than do regular crayons." Drago reasoned: "The 
scent is produced only on the writing/drawing surface, so if anything, it is 
the surface that may be licked or eaten. The most common coloring surface is 
paper, which does not pose a serious ingestion hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 Another test was done with 170 families with children, who used the crayons 
for a week. None of the parents reported that their children had placed the 
crayons in their mouths or eaten them. 
</P>
<P>
 Crayola Magic Scent Crayons ($2.79) come in boxes of 16 regular size or eight 
large size and are available nationally.

 To get the new school year off to a green start, the largest children's 
environmental group in the country is offering an eco-action tip sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten Things Kids Can Do to Help the Earth" is a checklist of activities 
ranging from recycling to planting a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the latest project from Kids For A Clean Environment (KIDS F.A.C.E.), 
founded in 1989 by 9-year-old Melissa Poe of Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa received national attention when she wrote a letter to the White House 
discussing her fears about pollution. She got a lot of support from kids -- and 
from corporate sponsors, who continue to underwrite costs of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 For a free copy of the tip sheet, send your name and address to:

</P>
<P>
 If you're really interested in living a more environmentally correct life, 
you'll like a new book from San Diego environmental consultant Jim Bell. His 
self-published guide to "Achieving Eco-Nomic Security on Spaceship Earth" is 
getting excellent reviews for its practical information. 
</P>
<P>
 This book offers suggestions on how to turn the environment around. For 
information, write to Bell at 2923 E. Spruce St., San Diego, Calif. 92104. A 
Day When the Coast Gets a Good Scrubbing 
</P>
<P>
 Want to take a hands-on approach to defending the environment? Volunteers of 
all ages are welcome to join in the 10th Annual Coastal Cleanup Day on Sept. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup Day is part of the California Coastal Commission's ongoing 
adopt-a-beach program, which combines conservation, education, recycling and 
action to fight litter. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cleanup Day details (and to order a Coastal Cleanup T-shirt if you want to 
be in uniform) call the CCC at (800) COAST-4U. Roundup 
</P>
<P>
 The City of Los Angeles Hazmobile will collect hazardous household waste by 
appointment only in these locations: San Pedro from Thursday to Saturday and 
Sept. 15-17; Sun Valley on Sept. 22-24 and Sept. 29-Oct. 1, and Rancho Park,

THE GOODS; GOTTA GET A GUDRUM; WHAT MAKES A CLOTHING LINE WORTH CHASING THROUGH 
TWO CONTINENTS? SNAZZY COLOR COMBINATIONS, CURIOUS PRINTS AND UNAVAILABILITY.

<P>
 Are we crazy, or what? 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday, we were among eight women -- friends and colleagues -- 
who raised iced tea glasses to toast a rather buxom, middle-aged Swedish woman 
whom only one of us had met. Each of us wore one of her designs. The luncheon 
table was set with place mats and napkins in two of "her" colors, sea green and 
bright pink, and the cake's icing mimicked a Gudrun pattern. Even the dog was 
festooned with a scarf from an old Gudrun outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of clothes would prompt otherwise hypersensible women accustomed to 
toll-free phone shopping to immerse themselves in the minutiae of foreign 
currency conversion, Swedish-German language translation and international 
postage and duty rates? Unusual ones, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail had the first Gudrun, a Hanukkah gift in 1986 from her mother. An 
ordinary striped T-shirt at first glance, its color combination -- rust, black, 
gray and purple -- patterned pockets, placket lining and cuffs said this is not 
the Gap or the Limited. 
</P>
<P>
 That shirt had come from the Swedish designer's new Berkeley store, her 
inaugural U.S. retail and mail-order operation. It was typical of her 
loose-fitting approach to dresses, sweaters, tops, jackets -- all in natural 
fibers and made to last. Were it not for Gudrun's colors, curious prints and 
knack for overlapping patterns -- stripes with dots, geometric blocks with 
squiggles -- you might say her stuff was dowdy. These distinctive colors and 
design details often reappear in new collections, so nothing goes out of style. 
</P>
<P>
 Gudrun Sjoden launched her clothing line in 1976 and now has about 100,000 
customers, mostly in Scandinavia and northern Europe. Because layering is part 
of the look, the separates work as well in sunny Southern California as they do 
in intemperate Sweden. But the Berkeley outlet -- and another short-lived one 
in Palo Alto -- eventually succumbed in 1990 to the difficulties of managing a 
far-flung business. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the ranks of Los Angeles Gudrunites had swelled. Within a year after 
Gail first turned up in that T, a dozen or so women -- all of us 
then-colleagues at a local research institute -- were ordering from Gudrun's 
Berkeley store. Each season's catalogue was passed around, much discussed and 
noticeably dog-eared. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Berkeley shop closed, and its number disconnected, the Gudrun 
loyalists started to get a little crazy. A UCLA professor whom Gail had 
befriended after spotting her in a Gudrun sweater planned a sabbatical in 
Sweden so she could stock up. Others combed Berkeley thrift stores for 
discarded Gudruns. Gail's mother, who once worked at the Gudrun shop, was more 
than once offered money by strangers for the Gudruns off her back. 
</P>
<P>
 We wanted Gudrun bad. 
</P>
<P>
 We wrote to Sweden (Gudrun Sjodens, Box 91731, 120 17 Stockholm) to request a 
catalogue. No reply. We wrote again. This time a catalogue arrived, along with 
a handwritten letter advising us that the company would not ship to the United 
States. So sorry, it said in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration hardened into resolve. As professional researchers, surely we 
could figure a way to get Gudrun. We inventoried our resources: one colleague 
who spoke Swedish, others who had friends in European cities to which the 
company might ship, a fax machine, phones, determination.  
</P>
<P>
 The phone work paid off. We discovered that while the Swedish outlets would 
not ship to the States, one of the German stores would. With this news the 
Gudrun group gathered via E-mail, converting catalogue prices and translating 
key words and phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, we faxed a very long order to Germany. A helpful clerk 
responded within the day, detailing the sizes and colors available. The order 
was revised, another fax sent and the money wired (no credit cards). We waited. 
</P>
<P>
 The day the first package arrived, three months later, was like Christmas. 
Each of us came by Gail's office, either to pick up our own order or to admire 
everyone else's.  
</P>
<P>
 Self-congratulations were in order: We had managed to get the clothes we love, 
to stop hoarding the fading Gudruns we had and to anticipate the collections 
ahead. We had discovered that catalogue shopping, often touted as a private 
experience, can be an opportunity for friendship and shared pleasure.  
</P>
<P>
 Would a celebratory lunch, complete with Gudrun-patterned cake, be going too 
far? Nah. The invitation read: "It wasn't easy but we did it -- we got Gudrun! 
Please come celebrate our retailing coup!"

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; WHILE BANDS PLAY ON; THIS IS NOT YOUR FATHER'S 
EVENT. ALL-DAY CONCERTS LIKE LOLLAPALOOZA OFFER LOTS MORE THAN MUSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE MONETTE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Christine Monette is a senior at 
Rosary High School in Fullerton.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Generations have been defined by the music they listen to -- and by the 
concerts they attend. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Woodstock in the '60s -- and now Woodstock in the '90s. In between 
were a host of scenes -- punk, heavy-metal, hip-hop, to name a few -- and lots 
of concerts in auditoriums and stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's concert scene is growing and changing, most notably from one-band 
evenings to all-day events filled with music and everything else under the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a crash course in concert-going, which may come in handy if you plan to 
attend Lollapalooza this Sunday and Monday at Cal State Dominguez Hills, or any 
other major festival inspired by the alternative music extravaganza.  
</P>
<P>
 The music -- which can range from Smashing Pumpkins to George Clinton to the 
Japanese group Shonen Knife -- is only the start.  
</P>
<P>
 Be prepared for all manner of leafleting: Politics swings from women's rights 
to gun control to homophobia. Food options can vary from Greek to African to 
Australian. And there are "smart drinks" designed to stimulate and nourish the 
brain and nervous system.  
</P>
<P>
 You can pierce your body, or, if you're old enough (18), get a tattoo. You can 
experience a virtual reality ride, cool off in a rain room or rest in a shade 
tent. You can have your uncensored say at a poetry slam or learn about animal 
rights or AIDS research. You can play with computers at the Electric Carnival, 
join in the live talk show "Oprahpalooza" or shop at the record store. You can 
participate in discussions with the feminist majority or try the computer 
dating service. You can check out acoustic performances in the gazebo or talk 
with the talent backstage by computer. 
</P>
<P>
 If you get tired of all that, you can usually listen to any one of a dozen or 
more bands on main and secondary stages. 
</P>
<P>
 These festivals are a way to escape from parents, work or school. They're a 
place to meet people and have a blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing what to bring can make the concert experience even better. Sun block 
is a necessity, especially at an all-day concert. Sunglasses and a multipurpose 
sitting towel are also handy. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding what to wear may take more thought. You could go for the 
past-souvenir-T-shirt-and-sandal look. Or the flannel and Doc Marten's look. Or 
the bikini top and cutoffs. Or jean shorts and no shirt. Or the baggy-pant 
skater look. Or, break away from all the established looks and create your own 
cool fashion statement. Whatever your look, a hat that shades you face is a 
worthwhile accessory.  
</P>
<P>
 Arrive with time to make parking and fighting your way through the crowd 
easier. Give yourself time to enjoy the music groups as well as the shopping, 
the information bonanza and other available. The people-watching alone will be 
too good to rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds line up hours before the music is scheduled to begin, so take Frisbees, 
hackey sacks, squirt guns or cards to play with in the parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
 You will also need to drink plenty of water. The heat mixed with dancing and 
large crowds can result in heat stroke -- which will probably mean going home. 
Lollapalooza supplies free water, so drink up. But avoid restroom breaks during 
a break in the music or you will encounter monstrous lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Take plenty of cash for food and souvenirs. You might want a temporary tattoo, 
T-shirt or exotic necklace. 
</P>
<P>
 If you choose to brave the mosh pit, take bandages and tissues for bloody 
noses. Watch out for those heavy boots, and be prepared to get sweaty. You 
might want to avoid moshing near security guards; newcomers to the pit might 
want to avoid the center, where moshing is usually its fiercest. Also, be 
careful not to lose your wallet or car keys in the commotion; it could make the 
full day a little too long. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a backpack to cart around everything. You might consider throwing in a 
sweat shirt in case the evening gets chilly. If you want to take a camera to 
record your experience, a disposable one is convenient. It is lightweight, and 
a lot less-expensive loss if by some chance it doesn't come home with you. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember you are not just listening to music, you are defining a generation. 
Today's music festivals are meant to be a total experience. A little advance 
planning will greatly enhance that experience and prevent disappointment.  
</P>
<P>
 Anticipation is a part of the pleasure of any experience. When the big event 
finally arrives, enjoy it. The experience is what you make it. You might end up 
with memories to last a lifetime, or at least enough anecdotes to enliven the 
first days back at school! 
</P>
<P>
 * TICKET INFORMATION 
</P>
<P>
 Some tickets at $27.50 per day are still available for Lollapalooza on Sunday 
and Monday at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Los Angeles. Gates open at noon, 
musical program begins at 2.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; TARGETING TEEN NEEDS IN HEALTH, PREVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLY WILLIAMS COOK, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pediatricians attend to young children; obstetricians care for pregnant women, 
and internists treat adults. Yet the health issues of teen-agers are 
significantly different from those of children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health care providers need to monitor the progress of puberty," says Gail B. 
Slap, co-author with Martha M. Jablow of "Teenage Health Care" (Pocket Books, 
$14), a comprehensive family guide for the preteen to young adult years. 
</P>
<P>
 Slap is the director of Adolescent Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania 
School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. She says that 
as teen-agers' medical needs change and they become increasingly uncomfortable 
with their pediatricians, they often fall out of care. 
</P>
<P>
 With this in mind, Slap wrote "Teenage Health Care" as a reference for both 
teens and their parents, stressing prevention as a main theme. The last part of 
the book can be read as a problem arises. Issues covered include knee pain, low 
blood count and thyroid conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Slap suggests that parents and teens read the first half of the 530-page book, 
which focuses on such issues as nutrition, dealing with chronic conditions and 
sexual identity, at their leisure and when an illness is not present. She hopes 
that an open discussion will ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tendency for parents to look the other way when confronted about a 
subject they feel less comfortable with," Slap says. "Communication is the 
biggest problem between parents and teens." 
</P>
<P>
 She maintains that although her book is reassuring and dispenses a great deal 
of information, it does so without arriving at a diagnosis or offering a 
treatment. "The book hopefully increases awareness about a problem which exists 
and lays out a system of where to go for help and how to determine if the 
doctor is the right one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Slap says teens should learn to become savvy health-care consumers, she 
cites numerous barriers in achieving that goal. Among them: payment, consent 
and confidentiality, age-appropriate services, sociocultural barriers and 
availability of services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teens need visible, accessible, attractive health-care providers who can 
anticipate their concerns," Slap says. "The provider should use the appropriate 
language and be understandable without talking down. Lack of respect is the 
issue which hurts teens the most. They are working hard to become adults, and 
if they aren't respected, they become hurt and shut down." 
</P>
<P>
 Slap says doctors who are interested in the field of adolescent medicine are 
either setting up practices strictly for teens or putting hours aside on 
weekends and evenings for this age group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that every teen needs a specialist for his or her age group. 
But I think that a family practitioner or intern should know the basics; it 
should be part of the core education," Slap says. "Studies have shown that it 
isn't important whether a girl sees a woman doctor or a boy sees a man. The 
imperative issue is that the doctor (be) someone to be trusted, is easy to 
relate to and will remain confidential."

 If you've fallen in love with apparel, housewares or other merchandise that's 
sold only overseas, mail-order purchases may be possible -- if you have a copy 
of the catalogue. The following tips may speed the ordering process and reduce 
the risk of disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Write, fax or call to find out if the company will ship to the United 
States, if a minimum order is required, and what form of payment is accepted 
(e.g. credit card or bank wire). The newspaper publishes foreign currency 
exchange rates for converting prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enlist friends to order from the same company, because a bulk purchase will 
be hard to resist. (A dozen of us ordered from Gudrun; our bill totaled just 
more than $1,000.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Make your selections carefully because returns may be difficult -- if not 
impossible. A dictionary will help you decipher fabrics, sizes and styling 
touches. (We succeeded with Gudrun because some of us were familiar with her 
sizes and colors.) Select a second or third choice in case your first one is 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jot down the name of the person who takes your order. Follow-up calls to him 
or her may be necessary to verify receipt of your payment or shipment of your 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask about insurance -- who pays for it and what it will cover. Imagine 
waiting weeks for hard-to-find Wedgwood china only to discover breakage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask how your order will be shipped and when the U.S. duty is due. (Our 
Gudrun clothes came via ship to Hoboken, N.J., then to us via the U.S. Postal 
Service. Upon the packages' arrival, we had to write a check for the duty.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't give up, but be realistic: A dress ordered in November won't make it 
to the office Christmas party. MOLLY SELVIN and GAIL ZELLMAN

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: FOX DROPS THE BALL ON SUNDAY'S POST-GAME LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fox stunned just about everyone by audaciously outbidding venerable CBS for 
telecast rights to the National Football League. An even bigger surprise would 
be Fox enticing a large chunk of its football and John Madden junkies to hang 
around on Sundays for a prime-time lineup that opens feebly with "Fortune 
Hunter" and closes obnoxiously with "Wild Oats." 
</P>
<P>
 Both series premiere this weekend, sharing the evening with two gasping 
oldies, "The Simpsons" and "Married . . . With Children," and "Hardball," a new 
baseball comedy that has been undergoing so many 11th-hour revisions (not a 
hopeful sign) that a review tape was unavailable prior to its own Sunday debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spy adventure" is the label charitably given "Fortune Hunter," whose hero is 
former Cold War agent Carlton Dial (Mark Frankel), a high-tech James Bond. His 
mission now is to recover the world's most sought-after items, and his actions 
are visually monitored and supported back at the home office by nerdy and 
eccentric (is there any other kind?) computer wizard Harry Flack (John Robert 
Hoffman). Flack is the voice in Dial's ear, a la Holly Hunter whispering 
information to anchor William Hurt from the control room in "Broadcast News." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is hoping that Dial, its "man's man who is irresistible to women," will 
also prove irresistible to the men's men and anyone else zooming in on 
football. He won't lack for exposure. When teams are not filling the air with 
footballs, Fox surely will be filling the airwaves with promos for "Fortune 
Hunter" and the rest of its Sunday night schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The protagonist of "Fortune Hunter" is not just a playboy, says Fox, for 
"underneath his wink and smile, Dial performs his high-risk assignments with 
deadly seriousness." 
</P>
<P>
 Too much seriousness, actually: This is minimalist Bond in every sense. As 
Dial searches for a sort of doomsday weapon known as Frostfire -- while 
encountering the obligatory beautiful blonde -- you're struck by the clunky 
premiere's absence of wit and style, to say nothing of a plot unworthy even of 
fanciful escapism. In a final act of bungled-Bond derivation, moreover, Dial 
and his sexy female companion end their low-budget adventure by romantically 
floating out to sea in a raft. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as lethal are the premiere's wooden performances. A supposedly 
charismatic hero who is somehow devoid of charisma, Briton Frankel's Dial is 
even more forgettable than George Lazenby, who had one shot as Bond in 1969's 
"On Her Majesty's Secret Service." Fittingly, it turns out that his gun shoots 
darts that put people to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Agent Dial. License to tranquilize. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on to "Wild Oats," another signature series for Fox, perennially 
last among the four major networks in households, first in raging hormones. 
</P>
<P>
 Playfully mocking the hand that feeds it, Sunday's season opener for "The 
Simpsons" features a line that applies here. "Honey, what's on Fox, tonight?" 
Homer Simpson asks his wife. "Something ribald, no doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Pointlessly ribald, in the case of the comedy "Wild Oats," Fox's horniest 
series of the evening -- no small feat given that it follows "Married . . . 
With Children." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Wild Oats" main foursome consists of photographer Jack Slayton (Tim 
Conlon), social worker Brian Grant (Paul Rudd), teacher Shelly Thomas (Paula 
Marshall) and hairdresser Liz Bradford (Jana Marie Hupp). 
</P>
<P>
 All somewhere in their 20s, all idiots. 
</P>
<P>
 When they're not at a Chicago singles bar named the Hangar, they do their 
flying at Jack and Brian's apartment. As if the dangers of impulsive sex in the 
'90s didn't exist, the premiere revolves around sleeping around. The especially 
grating Jack has a fit when his former girlfriend, Shelly, begins dating his 
somewhat dense best friend and roommate, Brian. He and a bimbo he's out with 
even eavesdrop from the bedroom on Shelly and Brian talking in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 The premiere desperately needs its own condom to filter out bad jokes and 
raunch. Sample: "I've dated before," Brian says. "I've felt the gentle thump of 
the headboard against the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's Sunday nightcap. "You're disgusting," Shelly tells Jack. Exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 THE STALKER. There he was on the street Monday with a KCBS-TV Channel 2 camera 
operator, pursuing, even badgering Mark Fuhrman, the Los Angeles police 
detective whose credibility has been under heavy attack by the O. J. Simpson 
defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 There he was, Channel 2's Inquiring Mind on the run with a microphone, 
repeatedly imploring Fuhrman to speak, as Fuhrman firmly resisted. Even though 
Fuhrman, like anyone else, has a right not to speak to the media -- who do 
these reporters think they are, God's appointees or something? -- his refusal 
gave the impression that he had something to hide, even if he didn't. Maybe 
that was the purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole scene was a pitiful display of TV again using the ambush interview 
like an assault weapon, using it to bully someone who was seeking to remain 
silent. Again, his right. 
</P>
<P>
 The Channel 2 reporter was doing plenty of talking, though. "I'm just trying 
to do my job," Harvey Levin pleaded to Fuhrman. 
</P>
<P>
 That job is harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Fortune Hunter" premieres at 7 pm Sunday with "Hardball" at 8:30 and "Wild 
Oats" at 9:30, on Fox (Channels 11 and 6).

WHIMSY TO WEAR; ART: PLAYFUL WORK REFLECTS LUNNA MENOH'S PERCEPTIONS BUT IS 
NON-JUDGMENTAL, SHE INSISTS. IT IS ON DISPLAY AT SOUTH COAST PLAZA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lun*na Menoh's work explores such hefty topics as sexual politics, social 
psychology and personal identity. But, like the star-studded moniker she's 
fashioned for herself, it's all done up with decorative whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very playful," said the erstwhile Atsuko Shimizu, who changed her name 
years ago to avert mix-ups with a neighbor who had a nearly identical name and 
address. 
</P>
<P>
 A former fashion designer who melds contemporary art and couture, Menoh 
displays her wearable sculpture in "Boutique Mystique," at Laguna Art Museum's 
South Coast Plaza satellite. The exhibition opens today and runs through Dec. 
4. 
</P>
<P>
 Made of velvet, brocade, tulle and so on, her fanciful creations (from the 
past five years) include a woman's vanity that doubles as a bra, a head-to-toe 
hat that envelops its wearer, and corseted, box-like "dresses" that make 
wearers appear as lasciviously packaged gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Their playfulness bespeaks Menoh's desire, she said recently, to reflect 
various realities she perceives -- the way women are objectified, for example 
-- but to avoid passing judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "My work doesn't say something is good or bad," the Los Angeles artist said 
recently during an interview at the gallery. "It's not about what you should or 
should not do." 
</P>
<P>
 That approach stems from her belief that what may be negative for one person 
may be positive for another, Menoh said, citing "Gentleman's Closet" by way of 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece, which consists essentially of cuffs and collars of quite similar 
men's shirts hanging from a clothing rack, refers to the idea that men's 
fashions have not changed much over time, Menoh said. That alludes to the idea 
that men still hold more social power than women. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that society doesn't want men to change may be repugnant to some, she 
said, but a blessing to others who "need that bondage," those hard-and-fast 
sexual roles to feel an invulnerable sense of identity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The same non-judgmental, humorous commentary infuses such works as "Indoor 
Game I" and "Indoor Game II," the box-like affairs meant to showcase wearers' 
legs, garters and all, and "Peeking Bra," Menoh's cheery vanity-cum-brassiere. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter, crafted of turquoise velvet and trimmed in pearls, sports 
something of a vanity table's top, hollowed out so that if the piece were worn, 
the wearer's breasts would more or less be covered by the vanity's upper half, 
unless the bra-shaped contraption is adjusted to expose the nipples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women used to be considered part of the furniture" and often are still viewed 
only as sexual objects, Menoh said, quick to reiterate that she doesn't mean to 
knock the idea, but attempts to have fun with it instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist, who exhibited her pieces on live models at Art L.A. '93, an 
international contemporary art festival, turns her attention to the power of 
thought in "Hat Dress," the all-enveloping hat that resembles a black cage with 
cloth-covered metal bars. On the bars cling large letters, attached with 
Velcro, which can be moved about. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thoughts we have control our actions, language controls our whole body," 
she said. "One person may think it looks like a cage, but another might think 
it's like a child's puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
 A jovial 37-year-old who moved here from her native Japan five years ago, 
Menoh attributes her equivocal attitude to her upbringing. In general, she 
said, the Japanese are less judgmental than Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Tokyo that she attended fashion school, but after her first foray 
into the field, discovered that she had no taste for "the business part of it." 
So, although she had attended only a few fine-art classes, she decided to 
combine her long-held love for art and apparel. She's never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clothing is very interesting to me," she said with a smile, because it is 
both an expression of who we are and something to hide behind. "It's very 
tricky." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Boutique Mystique" runs through Dec. 4 at Laguna Art Museum's satellite in

IN 'WAY OF THE WORLD,' NOTHING IS AS IT SEEMS; THEATER REVIEW: THE OLD GLOBE 
THEATRE'S TIMELESS STAGING OF THE WILLIAM CONGREVE 1700 RESTORATION COMEDY OF 
MANNERS IS HANDSOME WITH LOTS OF PLOT AND JUST AS MUCH HUMOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a gentleman employs the phrase "the way of the world" in the William 
Congreve play of that title, he refers to all the machinations of the material 
world -- greed, duplicity and lechery -- that despicable people always use to 
explain why their way of operating is necessary. The Old Globe Theatre's new 
production of the 1700 play, the last of the Restoration comedies, underlines 
the similarities between Congreve's material world and our own. 
</P>
<P>
 But, if you're not in a mood to be lectured to, director Jack O'Brien provides 
a show handsome and jolly enough just to entertain, until of course Congreve 
gets off one of his exceptional zingers. 
</P>
<P>
 There is so much plot in "The Way of the World" that my best advice is to 
ignore it. Just who is betraying whom will be abundantly clear. Money is almost 
always the reason, except in the case of Mirabell (Byron Jennings) and 
Millamant (Carolyn McCormick) who machinate because they are in love. At least 
they're more in love than anyone else, which means they speak frankly to each 
other of their base motivations. 
</P>
<P>
 Love is extremely relative here. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wit department, these lovers are descendants of Shakespeare's comedic 
heroes, but in fact they are closer to their own descendants, the overly bred, 
overly cultured vultures of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos' 1782 novel "Les 
Liaisons Dangereuses," adapted into a popular play and movie of the 1980s as 
well as the San Francisco Opera production opening next week. Tossing off bon 
mots while making dangerous liaisons is everything; real feeling is entirely 
beside the point. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien sets the play vaguely in this century, but provides a handsome couple 
in 17th-Century dress to watch the proceedings as if to make sure the 
characters are getting it right. They sometimes call our attention to a mirror 
atop the set (oh, there we are!). A bust of Shakespeare also looks down at the 
stage, with a bored Will leaning casually on one arm, showing a kind of mild 
tolerance for the work of a minor rival. He may also be impatient with these 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirabell and Fainall (Mark Harelik) are ostensibly friends, sharing a hand of 
cards, gossip and cold philosophy on seducing women for practical purposes. 
That they will battle each other ruthlessly and secretly for the control of 
Millamant's fortune has no bearing on their friendship -- betrayal is simply 
the way of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The women are no better. Millamant readily confesses that the chief pleasure 
of her beauty is its power to inflict pain, which she and everyone else do with 
the hearty faith that no other logic could possibly prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 In a world devoid of spirituality, looks are everything, and this play looks 
pretty terrific. Sets (Ralph Funicello), lights (Kent Dorsey) and particularly 
costumes (Lewis Brown) are striking. The palette is set by the stage floor, a 
green pseudo-marble streaked with blues and purples. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown dresses the women in fashions that borrow (much like designer Vivienne 
Westwood) from both relevant centuries -- the fine ladies wear the huge 
petticoats of Congreve's time but in contemporary colors, black-and-white 
check, shades of brown with pink bows, magenta. Their maids dress as the 
assistants to Lady Di would, in expensive but dowdy off-the-rack dresses and 
sensible shoes. This keen and witty attention to dress keeps the play spinning 
in just the right fashion. How things and people look is of utmost importance 
to the success of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has dressed Millamant as the most vulgar of the fine ladies, and 
McCormick plays her as such, so insistent about her charms that it's surprising 
anyone finds her charming at all. (This is a bit of a problem, as we would like 
someone to root for, however halfheartedly.) As her lover, Jennings is much 
drier and more likable, using a debonair appeal to the audience to join with 
him in suffering the other fools on the stage with droll humor. 
</P>
<P>
 As Fainall, the villain only slightly more villainous than the hero, Mark 
Harelik is that dangerous blend -- a confident nervous wreck. He also looks 
fabulous, smoking a cigarette like the most dashingly cold cad, with black hair 
as oily as his philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 As his mistress Marwood, Lillian Garrett-Groag will be a revelation to anyone 
who saw her battered Native American squaw in "The Kentucky Cycle"; here she is 
as hard and glamorous as a diamond. Also terrific as Mrs. Fainall is Jennifer 
Schelter, who is so quietly confident of her Catherine Deneuve-like beauty that 
she can actually wear a hat on top of Amazonian height. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the purely comic roles, Mary Louise Wilson as Lady Wishfort alone makes her 
character something more than silly. She has a hilarious bit ordering about her 
maid (Anna Cody), whose useless hands dangle from her wrists like a woman with 
a fresh manicure. Two other maids, Foible (Monique Fowler) and Mincing (Eve 
Holbrook), are both very funny. Henry J. Jordan as Mirabell's man is also 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapter Dakin Matthews supplies a nifty prologue and epilogue that, in true 
Restoration form, refers in a fun, insidery-way to the world of the 
theatergoers. 
</P>
<P>
 Congreve's final message to us -- "Marriage frauds too oft are repaid in kind" 
-- is an apt warning, always relevant. But if you hope to be faithful for some 
less pragmatic reason, there is none even hinted at in "The Way of the World." 
With any luck, you'll find that reason in your own world.

SOTHEBY'S NEW BEVERLY HILLS SPACE TO INCLUDE AUCTION HOUSE; ART: THE COMPANY 
EXPECTS TO OPEN IN 1995 TO 'HAVE AN INCREASED PRESENCE ON THE WEST COAST.' THE 
NEW FACILITY WILL ALSO ACCOMMODATE EXHIBITIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES. 
</P>

<P>
 The New York and London-based Sotheby's plans to open a new Beverly Hills 
facility -- including a space for art auctions. The decision signals a Southern 
California comeback for the firm, which closed its Los Angeles sales room in 
1982 and retrenched in offices on Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The new quarters, on the ground floor of a high-rise at 9665 Wilshire Blvd., 
are scheduled to open Feb. 1, 1995, according to Andrea Van de Kamp, senior 
vice president and managing director of Sotheby's West Coast operations. The 
13,000-square-foot facility will accommodate exhibitions, auctions, 
administrative offices and Sotheby's International Realty Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly this means that Sotheby's is going to have an increased presence on 
the West Coast," Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm has conducted jewelry auctions and last spring it held a print 
auction at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Current plans call for holding 
two print sales and two jewelry auctions in the new space each year. Auctions 
of other materials are under consideration, according to Van de Kamp. "The 
major market for paintings is in New York and London, but there are many other 
interesting possibilities," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new location offers increased visibility, including a terrace at the 
corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Bedford Drive that can be used for public 
functions, she said. Along with hosting exhibitions to promote its auctions, 
Sotheby's will organize educational programs in cooperation with galleries and 
other arts institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sotheby's plans have received a largely enthusiastic response from the art 
community. While some dealers fear that increased auction activity may detract 
from their business, other dealers and collectors believe the move will benefit 
the local art scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great. It will really stimulate the art market," said dealer 
Louis Stern, who recently moved his Beverly Hills gallery to Melrose Avenue 
where he shares space with Jan Abrams. "I think people were very disappointed 
when Sotheby's closed its auction house on Beverly Boulevard," he said. "This 
really shows how important the Los Angeles market is. I don't think it can be 
ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good thing for the community," collector Philip Gersh said. West Coast 
auctions won't divert attention from major art sales in New York, but Sotheby's 
might be able to develop a regional market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned move is the latest indication that Beverly Hills is shaping up as 
the center of Southern California's high-end art market. With a few exceptions 
-- notably galleries formerly operated by Stern, Fred Hoffman and 
Salander-O'Reilly -- the city has been known in the art world as the home of 
highly commercial galleries. But during the past year two New York powerhouses 
have announced their intentions to open branches in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary dealer Larry Gagosian is renovating a Camden Drive space formerly 
occupied by Hoffman and Salander-O'Reilly. PaceWildenstein has confirmed its 
interest in leasing property at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Camden 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sotheby's will hold two more auctions at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel 
before relocating. A sale of modern and contemporary prints is scheduled for 
Oct. 5; an auction of 19th- and 20th-Century jewelry is slated for Sept. 26.

 First Female Captain: For the first time in the 28-year history of "Star 
Trek," the Federation starship will be helmed by a female captain, when the 
franchise's new syndicated series "Star Trek: Voyager" premieres in January. 
Oscar-nominated French Canadian film actress Genevieve Bujold ("Anne of the 
Thousand Days," "Coma") will head the Starship USS Voyager, which finds itself 
lost in a distant part of the galaxy along with a former enemy, the Maquis. The 
series, set in the same time frame as "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and 
"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine," also stars Robert Duncan McNeill ("All My 
Children") and Robert Beltran ("Models Inc.").

 Rosie Talks: Roseanne speaks out for the first time today about upcoming TV 
movies about her life that are under way at both Fox and NBC. "I read the NBC 
one -- it makes 'Mommie Dearest' look brilliant," Roseanne says on 
"Entertainment Tonight." "It's the worst, stupidest script -- like this twin 
comes out of me and sits next to me on my bed as my inner self, and I have 
these conversations with it! It's so bad." Roseanne also dishes on actress 
Denny Dillon, who portrays her in the Fox film, and adds that "I wish they'd 
wait till I die before they do these kinds of things."

 KCBS News Director: Roger Perret, a producer at KCAL-TV Channel 9, was named 
news director at KCBS-TV Channel 2 on Thursday. He replaces Robert Jordan, who 
resigned last month. Perret had been at KCAL since 1989; he previously was 
assistant news director at KNBC-TV Channel 4. KCBS has trailed its rivals at 
KNBC and KABC-TV Channel 7 in the local news ratings for many years, but Perret 
said, "This station is a sleeping giant about to awaken." THE ARTS

 Protecting Artists' Rights: In a potentially precedent-setting first test of a 
national law protecting artists' rights, a federal judge has prohibited the 
removal of a football field-sized sculpture from a New York office building. 
U.S. District Judge David Edelstein ruled that the installation is protected 
under the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990. Edelstein is the first judge to 
issue a permanent injunction under the law, which gives artists the right to 
prevent the "intentional distortion, mutilation or other modification" of their 
works that would be "prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation." The 
building's owner had sought to remove the installation by artists John Swing, 
John Veronis and John Carter (known as the "Three-J's"), but the judge ruled 
that the removal would destroy certain elements of the work. However, Edelstein 
denied the artists' request to finish the piece, which has been a work in 
progress since 1991. The ecologically themed installation uses recycled 
materials and includes giant mosaics on the floor and sculptural elements 
including a mythological god, a huge silver fish and an astronaut with a 
trash-can head. MOVIES

 Venice Fest Begins: The Venice Film Festival opened Thursday with a dispute 
over a celebrity judge threatening to steal the limelight from Oliver Stone, 
whose "Natural Born Killers" is favored to win the Golden Lion Award. The 
buildup to the 51st edition of Italy's premier film festival turned bitter when 
an organizer accused Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa of being too right wing 
to sit on the star-studded judges panel, which includes actress Uma Thurman and 
director David Lynch. However, the festival's head, filmmaker Gillo Pentecorvo, 
defended Vargas Llosa as a man of culture ideally suited for the job. 
Meanwhile, the judges have their jobs cut out for them: Italian Gianni Amelio's 
low-budget "L'america" (America), a moving tale of an Italian con man who tries 
to get rich by opening a shoe factory in post-communist Albania, is seen as 
Stone's chief challenger for the Golden Lion.

 Zeffirelli Sues Magazine: Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli has sued the 
London-based movie magazine Screen International for libel for calling him a 
fascist member of the Italian Parliament. Zeffirelli is a senator representing 
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go, Italy) Party, which rules 
in coalition with the neo-fascist National Alliance and the federalist Northern 
League. Zeffirelli's attorney called the allegation "totally inaccurate" and 
"highly damaging to Franco Zeffirelli's international reputation." The magazine 
is aimed at senior personnel within the worldwide entertainment industry.

GOING FROM THE STREETS TO THE CAMERA; TELEVISION: T. RODGERS' RESUME INCLUDES 
PIMP, CRACK DEALER, GANGBANGER, A FOUNDING FATHER OF THE BLOODS -- ENOUGH TO 
GET HIM HIRED AS A SEGMENT PRODUCER ON 'BEHIND BARS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a little less luck, T. Rodgers would be in jail right now, instead of 
producing a new reality-based TV show about life behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 His resume could be a miniseries itself: pimp, crack dealer, gangbanger, a 
founding father of South-Central Los Angeles' notorious Bloods. But today 
Rodgers is behind the camera -- a tribute both to his moxie and to Hollywood's 
long-running fascination with the criminal mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "This job description was written for me," said the jowly, sad-eyed Rodgers, 
whose brother is locked up for murder. "This is my life experience that's 
talking." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers' job, which comes with an air-conditioned office in Encino and a 
middle-class paycheck, is to interview convicts for a five-day-a-week, 
half-hour program called "Behind Bars," which has earned strong ratings in 
national syndication since its premiere last May. Negotiations are under way to 
bring it to Los Angeles by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The series -- an occasionally riveting, sometimes hokey mix of documentary and 
dramatization -- does seem tailor-made for Rodgers, who delivered flamboyant 
commentaries on Fox's short-lived newsmagazine "Front Page" and served as a 
consultant on the controversial gang movie "Colors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His desk is stacked high with letters from inmates, who have heard through the 
grapevine that he's looking for good tales. Many call him collect from prisons 
around the country. Rodgers usually connects with them in the cool rap of the 
streets, but sometimes a hint of weariness also comes through, like a father 
figure who has seen too many of his wards go astray. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm like a surgeon -- I sit and look deep inside of their soul and anytime 
they come up with one of these b.s. lies, I check 'em," said Rodgers, who is in 
his late 30s. "I'm in your face until you deal with it. Because dealing with me 
is dealing with yourself. . . . I've been around forever." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the series' most poignant episodes, Rodgers took advantage of his 
extraordinary access to interview one of his own homeboys, Michael Williams, 
who had just been slapped with a 13-year robbery sentence. At first, Williams 
appeared tough and defiant on camera, but then Rodgers handed him a funeral 
program from the 1988 murder of Williams' younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Williams' steely facade melted, and big tears rolled down his 
cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We got feelings, but we got to maintain this image, see," Williams said as 
soon as he gained his composure. "Out of all the images that you maintain, you 
still got a heart. . . . All of these big rough people got hearts. They can all 
be broke down. I got broke down by a picture, a memory, a thought." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the kind of street-level intimacy that GRAB Productions was hoping for 
when it hired Rodgers to be one of two supervising segment producers for the 
series, which is now showing in about 20 medium-sized markets, including 
Seattle, Sacramento, Cleveland, St. Louis and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's gimmick is to package the jailhouse interviews around an issue: 
Should juveniles be tried as adults? Should white-collar criminals get more 
lenient sentences? Should inmates be allowed to study law? Viewers are then 
urged to cast their votes by calling a 900-number, the proceeds of which are 
earmarked for a victims' support group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's entertainment and it's ratings and it's money, but I would certainly 
hope that we can affect people's lives, too," said Beth Humphreys, a segment 
producer and research director who learned the ropes working for "Rescue 911." 
"I think reality TV has a responsibility to educate, to find something 
redeemable." 
</P>
<P>
 To balance the generally sympathetic tone of the interviews, Rodgers' onetime 
nemesis, former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, was hired to host the 
show. But after the first 25 episodes, he was replaced by actor Paul Sorvino, 
who appeared in "GoodFellas" and "Law & Order." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said he had no problem working with Rodgers, but thought some of the 
episodes were designed only to titillate, not illuminate. "There was one show 
about pregnant women in county jail -- should they get medical treatment? -- 
and I'm thinking to myself: 'This is the dumbest issue I've ever seen in my 
life,' " Gates said. "Sometimes it was hard to keep a straight face." 
</P>
<P>
 Executive producer Gary Bernstein said that Gates was a little too straight. 
"Some of the stations felt that they wanted somebody a little more polished," 
Bernstein said. "Daryl's not a professional actor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, too, has been thrust into an unfamiliar and not entirely comfortable 
world, where the fiercest battles revolve around office politics, and disputes 
get settled with memos, not guns. His baggy outfits and braided hair turn heads 
on Ventura Boulevard. At night, he usually races back to his South-Central 
apartment, fearful that police are more apt to stop his '77 lowrider 
custom-convertible truck if he's spotted in the San Fernando Valley after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "T. is a young man with a lot of intelligence and personality who grew up with 
a lot of negative things around him," said former NFL star Jim Brown, who runs 
a self-help program for ex-convicts that employed Rodgers as its national 
spokesman until last year. "To come out of that and try to make a contribution 
to the system -- and still remain true to yourself -- that's a very difficult 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest irony of Rodgers' new job is that he has never been to prison 
himself -- a fact that he attributes to a cadre of loyal homeboys who have 
taken the rap for some of his past transgressions. Lest he forget his debt to 
them, Rodgers has festooned his office door with yellow police tape -- direct 
from a crime scene in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminds me of what I could have been," he said. "I know that tape could 
seriously be across my door."

DISPLAY SPACE SHRINKS SO GIFT SHOP CAN STRETCH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If visitors to the Lun*na Menoh show get the feeling that Laguna Art Museum's 
satellite gallery in South Coast Plaza has shrunk, they'll be right. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum has reduced the gallery's floor space by half, to 600 square feet, 
to expand the adjacent gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The redesign was "done basically to make more profit from shop" sales, museum 
acting director Susan M. Anderson said. Like arts organizations nationwide that 
have seen private- and public-sector funding dwindle, "We are looking for new 
ways to be entrepreneurial right now," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The redesign is not necessarily permanent. It is viewed as the "first phase of 
what we hope is a complete redesign of the space," Anderson said, which may 
lead to exhibitions that extend "into the space of the plaza itself." Plans 
also call for more functional art, such as artist-designed furniture, to be 
offered in the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that, with the renovation and the new product mix, we'll bring 
more people into" the satellite, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the museum this week announced the bequest of a contemporary art 
collection and that it has hired a temporary replacement for its recently 
resigned associate director of development. 
</P>
<P>
 The 140-piece bequest is from the trust of Richard H. Mumper, a Laguna Beach 
art collector, longtime museum member and English teacher who died in May. It 
includes works by Richard Diebenkorn, Carlos Almaraz and Billy Al Bengston, and 
is "one of the most impressive collections of contemporary art given to the 
museum in the past decade," said Bolton Colburn, the museum's curator of 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Young is the part-time "development consultant" hired to stand in until a 
permanent replacement is found for Marilyn (Mickey) Shaw, who resigned in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who will oversee the museum's fund-raising programs, will retain her 
other job as a marketing and development consultant to Santa Ana's Discovery 
Museum. Anderson said she expects to hire replacements soon for two other 
development staffers who resigned recently. ZAN DUBIN

MUSIC REVIEW; BLOMSTEDT AT BOWL: SIBELIUS, DEFINITIVELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There weren't any cheap thrills at Hollywood Bowl on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A serious two-piece program dispensing with frivolous opening ceremony marked 
the agenda. Serious musicians -- with ice in their veins -- held the stage. 
Committed and disciplined performances rang through the cool night air. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second night of their three-concert visit, Herbert Blomstedt and the 
San Francisco Symphony made no compromises with the outdoor circumstances and, 
before a crowd of 7,859, made it all fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Blomstedt is clearly a gifted musician and painstaking craftsman, but he has 
never been much of one to wear his heart on his sleeve. He's not one for 
sweating either. During one of his trademark patrician performances a listener 
can understandably feel as if it's all a little too easy, too dapper. On such 
occasions the 67-year-old conductor looks even more like George Will than he 
usually does.  
</P>
<P>
 But the smooth exterior of Blomstedt's interpretations is usually the result 
of his thorough grappling with the score, his dissection and reassemblage of 
its elements into an elegantly polished and ultimately convincing whole. So it 
was this night. 
</P>
<P>
 His like-minded soloist was 28-year-old German violinist Christian Tetzlaff. 
Tetzlaff, who made his Philharmonic debut last year with the Berg Concerto and 
his U.S. debut a few years before with the Schoenberg Concerto, also turned out 
to be a musician without a jot of nonsense in him. 
</P>
<P>
 His reading of the Brahms Violin Concerto was clean and lean, incisive and 
rhythmical. Where many violinists turn gooey, he forged ahead with tightly 
focused lyricism. Where most violinists stretch for profundity, arch for 
effect, he kept things moving forcefully, pointedly. One might fault him for 
rushing the cadenzas and for pretty much ignoring the fun in the finale, but 
his performance was all of a piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Blomstedt and orchestra offered a well-groomed accompaniment that made a 
virtue out of crispness. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sibelius' First Symphony, Blomstedt, long a much-admired specializer in 
Scandinavian repertory, coaxed a graceful and poignant performance from his 
orchestra. He defined colors purposefully, enforced balances tellingly, let the 
nuances speak quietly and allowed the big themes to bloom majestically. 
Although Blomstedt could do nothing to hold the patchwork last movement 
together (no one can), the work made all of its hefty, sweeping points. This 
was a definitive reading, without flash. TIMOTHY MANGAN

CLUB REVIEW; CASTING OFFICE ISN'T GOING HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chances are you won't meet Mrs. Right, rub elbows with Oliver Stone or meet 
anyone of industry import at the Casting Office. But that's what makes this 
Cahuenga Boulevard spot such a choice hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no reason to don any proverbial masks at the low-key, honky-tonk joint 
-- unless you're a felon on the lam. In its 18 years of operation, the Casting 
Office has been an off-duty police officer hangout, and true to its name, 
you'll also find the occasional actor at the bar, playing darts or pinball. The 
only regular, however, is a Humphrey Bogart look-alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many L.A. finds, this one is tucked away in a mini-mall. People who do 
chance in -- and the place does get packed on weekends -- can explore a 
wide-ranging jukebox selection, from AC/DC and Garth Brooks to Bix Beiderbecke 
and the Doors. Add Jimi Hendrix and Marvin Gaye -- also in generous supply -- 
to the mix and you'll understand why the customers don't shy away from 
shimmying in the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
 And as with all things "unhip" in L.A., true hep cats favor such places, as 
witnessed by a recent impromptu performance at the Casting Office by L.A. 
power-pop quartet Wax, whose agile lead singer Joe Sib may have been the first 
and last performer to jam on the cigarette machine.

ART REVIEW; WEDEMEYER'S ANIMATED ECCENTRICITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Wedemeyer's odd contraptions, ordinary photographs and the hand-crafted 
cameras in which they were made look as if they belong in a science-fair booth 
at school. Combining an earnest student's enthusiasm for learning how things 
work with a hobbyist's love of do-it-yourself inventions, his functional art is 
animated by its eccentricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedemeyer's 10 pinhole cameras at Pasadena City College Art Gallery are 
awkward boxes carefully constructed from plywood, metal latches, rope, 
compasses, mirrors, magnifying glasses and a transparent pantyhose container 
filled with water. Each low-tech device serves a single purpose that seems, 
simultaneously, sensible and absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of five photographs in which the scale of the objects depicted 
decreases incrementally is displayed behind the five specialized "Scale-Image 
Cameras" that were used to make them. The lenses of Wedemeyer's gerrymandered 
cameras aim downward between four wooden supports. 
</P>
<P>
 The most compact camera is a squat little box whose short legs position the 
lens close to the ground, resulting in close-up pictures in which things appear 
to be twice their actual size. 
</P>
<P>
 The lengths of the other cameras' legs increase mathematically. The tallest 
has spindly, eight-foot supports that allow for wide views, in which objects 
appear to be one-eighth their actual size. The legs intrude into all the 
pictures it generates, crowding out whatever else is depicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedemeyer's "Scale-Image" photographs thus replay the history of Modernist 
photography as a funny, scientific demonstration. As the distance between each 
camera's lens and the ground increases, the resulting images become 
increasingly self-referential. The world outside the photographic process 
shrinks in scale until it nearly disappears into a shadowy absence at the far 
ends of the longest camera's legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedemeyer's other pieces are even more outrageously dysfunctional. Made of 
cheap plastic lenses and seashells that cover one's ears, his "Virtual Reality 
Simulator" is a silly send-up of the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The water-filled lens of his "Gravity Camera" ensures that all its pictures 
are blurry close-ups of the ground. His "Semi-Cinematic Gestural Image Panorama 
Camera" functions like a low-budget movie camera, producing images that 
resemble abstract filmstrips. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wedemeyer's flat-footed exhibition, practical, goal-oriented behavior takes 
a turn toward the sort of purposelessness that is conventionally reserved for 
modern art. An American ethos of tinkering and inventing devices that function 
efficiently is effectively transformed into a selfish obsession. With this sort 
of unproductive labor, the processes engaged are more satisfying than any 
quantifiable results.

 Seven years ago Patrick Terrail closed his Hollywood Diner on Fairfax, the 
Franco-American bistro he opened after the demise of Ma Maison, his original 
establishment. Terrail, who still owned the Diner's building, then leased the 
space to Silvio De Mori and turned his energy to re-creating Ma Maison at the 
new Sofitel Hotel on the corner of Beverly and La Cienega. 
</P>
<P>
 De Mori ran the former Hollywood Diner as Tutto Bene until filing for Chapter 
7 (liquidation) bankruptcy last year. Then everything in the building was 
placed under the control of a court-appointed trustee. "I couldn't do anything 
for seven months," says Terrail, "not even show the place. I'm not going to 
tell you how much money it cost me." 
</P>
<P>
 Now a new restaurant is ready to move in: Jon Safier, who worked with Terrail 
at the Hollywood Diner and the Ma Maisons, has leased the space and after minor 
redecorating, plans to open mid-September as Provencia. The moderately priced 
menu will feature lots of grill and rotisserie items ("But with a French 
twist," Safier says). Steven Hermann, who cooked at Campanile on La Brea, is in 
charge of the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Weiss, who also worked for Terrail at the original Ma Maison, has 
been recruited to put together the wine list, which will feature 20 different 
wines from around the globe, all priced at $16. "There are lots of great 
bottles at great values out there," says Safier. "They've just been overpriced 
for too long." 
</P>
<P>
 One other Ma Maison alumni is also back on the scene: Terrail, who now works 
for Hiram Walker, will be consulting. "He won't be there every day to shake 
everyone's hand at the door," says Safier, "but he'll definitely be around . . 
. if not physically, at least spiritually." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to ensure that the property survives," says gruff-voiced Terrail. 
"That property is my retirement pension." 
</P>
<P>
 Closure: Joe Patti has closed La Famiglia and Piccola, its take-out offspring 
next door on Canon Drive in Beverly Hills. Patti, who could not be reached for 
comment, was one of the first restaurateurs to introduce Northern Italian 
cuisine back in the '70s when most Italian restaurants were still big on 
hanging dusty grapes and empty Chianti bottles. The 20-year-old hangout was 
always filled with tanned celebs, including crooner Dean Martin, sitting at the 
same booth, digging into his gnocchi. 
</P>
<P>
 Escrow Limbo: Is Yujean Kang ever going to open his West Hollywood restaurant? 
It depends on who you talk to. Despite announcing 10 months ago that he had 
purchased the now-shuttered La Toque site for his second restaurant, Kang has 
yet to close escrow. And "For Sale" signs are still posted on the Sunset Strip 
property. Yet the Pasadena restaurateur insists he is still in the process of 
buying La Toque. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Ken Frank, who owns the property, says he hasn't heard from Kang or his 
real estate broker for quite some time. "I really don't have any reason to 
believe (the deal) will go through," he told Calendar. "Let me know if you hear 
something so I can tell my broker." 
</P>
<P>
 Deals on Meals: Eat at the Beverly Hills boutique Emporio Armani weekdays 
between 3 and 6 p.m. and you'll receive a 30% discount on the entire menu. 
"'It's sort of like a happy hour," says a manager. "We don't tell you, we just 
take it off the bill." Too bad they won't do the same when you buy one of the 
Italian designer's classic suits. "I'll have the carpaccio and that cappuccino 
crepe suit, Size 10, per favore. "

RESTAURANT REVIEW; ALEGRIA TAPAS BAR NEEDS A SHARPER FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alegria, the new tapas bar on Pine Avenue in Long Beach, has a stylishly 
mad-cap look, as if the alegria -- or happiness -- in question was the 
intoxicated, transient giddiness of Pedro Almodovar's happy endings. A cute, 
swoopy counter lines a brick wall hung with colorful, cartoonishly framed Miro 
and Picasso posters. Over the bar, from iron racks, swing skeins of chiles and 
garlic and whole dry hams -- and I mean whole: Each ham still sports a leg and 
cloven hoof. 
</P>
<P>
 On a Saturday night, there's a Latin band: congas, sax and accordion, plus 
drum machine, computerized trumpets. We put our names in for a table out on the 
patio, and take a seat inside. The booming drum bounces off the walls, 
contradicts our heartbeats. We climb onto stools in an empty curve of the 
counter and soon are hollering away with our neighbors: Alegria is a fun, 
friendly place, packed with people drinking sangria from tumblers and sharing 
the classic small plates of food. 
</P>
<P>
 In Spain, people never drink without eating. Legend has it that in Spanish 
bars, a glass of wine or sherry was once served covered with a small plate of 
cheese or olives, compliments of the house. These little "lids" or "tapas" have 
since evolved into a genre of sophisticated, even pricey snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapas are small dishes, but they're not just hors d'oeuvres or finger food: 
They range from cold cuts to stews, salads to omelettes -- anything can be a 
tapa, so long as it comes in morsel-like portions. Ideally, tapas are ordered 
casually, one dish at a time over the course of a conversation or evening. 
</P>
<P>
 This ideal drinking and snacking process, which can go on for several hours, 
has its own challenges for a waiter, who must keep track. In Spain, tapas bars 
have various methods, from chalkboards to the honor system. At Alegria, 
however, we tended to order one or two dishes (to eat while we were deciding on 
more) and then, when those dishes came, to order all the rest of the dishes at 
once. This seems best: Cheerful and helpful as the waiters are when they're at 
your table, they can be very hard to spot, especially on busier nights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On our first visit, we fell for the platos grande , a platter made from any 
five tapas chosen from the menu. At $6.95 per person, this was a prudent move, 
but with so many items crammed onto one plate, it was a bit muddled: salty 
chunks of marinated cheese and sun-dried tomatoes, and limp slivers of peppers 
(allegedly with anchovies in a vinaigrette) sat on a bed of good, chewy paella; 
luckily, they put the decent ceviche in a separate glass. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapas themselves, regardless of presentation, can also be muddled. It's a 
challenge to any kitchen to turn out so many dishes. With about 30 tapas, plus 
sandwiches, salads and desserts on the menu, I didn't expect each dish at 
Alegria to be a dazzler. But I came away wishing that almost every dish had 
been more focused, finished, and, in some cases, fresher. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapas, being small, don't have time to seduce; their virtues should be clear, 
distinctive, immediate. 
</P>
<P>
 I did love crunchy lamb croquettes and their sauce, even if the sauce tasted 
more like mustard than a true ground hazelnut-and-chile romesco. Also clear and 
to-the-point was a mixed meat and cheese plate, with a few slices each of jamon 
serrano (here interchangeable with prosciutto), lomo embuchado (cured pork 
loin) and manchego cheese. Grilled vegetables were beautifully done: smoky and 
judiciously charred. Almost terrific were bite-sized corn tortillas, each 
topped with black beans, basil and chicken: They just needed a little kick of 
something -- salt, spice, lemon, something -- to knock them out of blandsville. 
</P>
<P>
 Less pleasing are brackish clams and mussels in a light saffron broth. A 
robust stew of chorizo and beef with leeks, cabbage and beans is murky and not, 
as promised, spicy. Half a baby chicken, roasted, is tasty and moist, but the 
"Spanish" rice is undercooked, bitter with saffron. 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, cola de novia , a soggy shell-shaped pastry is filled with 
vanilla flan that tastes mostly of refrigeration. Pear strudel is made with 
rock-hard pears. 
</P>
<P>
 All these dishes are not necessarily ill-conceived. Rather, they're lacking in 
focus and finesse, as if cooked by someone who has no feel for the final 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alegria Cafe and Tapas Bar, 115 Pine Ave., Long Beach, (310) 436-3388. Open 
for lunch Monday through Friday, for dinner 7 days. Full bar. Major credit 
cards. Dinner for two, food only $20-$45.

JAZZ NOTES: TWO FESTS TO OFFER A RANGE OF STYLES FOR HOLIDAY WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Labor Day weekend is upon us and two things are fairly clear: Summer will 
be soon coming to an end and so will the annual jazz festival season. This 
weekend, however, there are two well-established events -- each offering 
distinctly different styles of music -- in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11th annual gathering called the Los Angeles Classic Jazz Festival, which 
celebrates jazz from the New Orleans period to swing, takes place today through 
Monday at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott and Doubletree hotels. Just up the 
coast in Santa Barbara, the city's sixth annual international jazz festival 
offers an array of sounds from contemporary jazz to Cajun and blues. The event 
takes place Saturday through Monday on the beach near the city's Stern's Wharf. 
</P>
<P>
 And these are no small events. Estimated attendance for both festivals 
combined: 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had about 30,000 people last year and we expect more this year," says 
Bryan Seti, co-director of the Santa Barbara festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over 20,000 people attended our festival in 1993, and a similar crowd is 
expected this weekend," says Howard Pearlstein, who handles publicity for the 
Los Angeles Classic Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Classic Jazz Festival, with a lineup sparked by pianist Dick Hyman, 
trumpeters Harry (Sweets) Edison and Wendell Brunious, and reed players Bob 
Wilber and Abe Most, has gone far beyond its early years, which focused almost 
entirely on New Orleans and Dixieland styles of jazz. The aim of the shift is 
to broaden the festival's attendance base, says Pearlstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want younger people interested in this style of jazz so that it can live 
on, perpetuate itself," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there'll be plenty of lively two-beat music at the festival, supplied 
by the likes of Chris Kelly's Black and White New Orleans Jazz Band, Conrad 
Janis' Beverly Hills Unlisted Jazz Band and more than 20 others. There'll be 
blues this year too, with a special concert Monday featuring Linda Hopkins and 
Harmonica Fats, among others. Big bands led by Frank Capp and Louie Bellson 
will also appear. Dancing is encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival runs from about 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., today through Sunday, 
and 12:30 p.m. to 7 p.m., Monday. Daily tickets, $20-$35, all-event badges, 
$75. Information: (310) 641-5700. 
</P>
<P>
 The headliners in Santa Barbara include singers Kevyn Lettau, Shelby Flint and 
Roseanna Vitro, keyboardist Gregg Karukas, trumpeter Jeff Elliott and 
saxophonists Sonya Jason and Mike Gealer, most of whom will keep the accent on 
contemporary sounds and eschew mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had people like Cedar Walton and Jack Sheldon, but they didn't appeal 
to the crowd we draw," says Seti. "So we've gone more toward" an eclectic, 
pop-oriented format. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, which is held on the sand at the foot of State Street, will also 
feature such acts as bluesman Arthur Adams and the salsa band Tejas. Shows 
begin at noon Saturday through Monday, with concerts concluding at 10 p.m., 
except for Monday's show, which ends at 7 p.m. Daily tickets, $5-$20; three-day 
passes, $10-$40. Information: (805) 962-4636, Ext. 3000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lowdown on Lovano: What is perhaps the most compelling aspect of tenor 
saxophonist veteran Joe Lovano is his uniquely appealing melodic style: He 
consistently comes up with alternately lyrical and angular improvised lines 
that are startling in their originality. The hornman, who makes his Los Angeles 
debut as a leader with a one-nighter at the Jazz Bakery on Thursday, says this 
approach to melody goes all the way back to his father, "Big Tony" Lovano, who 
was also a tenor saxophonist but not well known outside Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was hip," says Lovano, who took up the saxophone as a preteen in 
Cleveland. "He said it was more important to learn the melodies of songs, and 
their progressions, in all 12 keys, than it was to memorize someone else's 
solos. So that's what I did from an early age." 
</P>
<P>
 This practice, and the influence of such masters as Sonny Rollins, John 
Coltrane and Ornette Coleman -- who blended both jazz's tradition and its 
forward-thinking avant-garde in their styles -- has led Lovano to the 
expressive melodic approach he employs today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to play freely within the concepts of music, using freer forms and 
rhythms, creating my own time and tempo within the chord progressions," says 
Lovano. "I don't like to repeat myself, and, when you play this way, you have 
to explore new things all the time and not just fall into patterns." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Bakery date, Lovano will arrive with a piano-less quartet featuring 
trumpeter Tim Hagans, bassist Derek Oles and drummer Carmen Castaldi. The 
absence of a piano allows for the kind of explorative improvising Lovano 
espouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get a little bit more intimate with just bass and drums," he says. 
"Then we have to really follow each other, listen deeply to each other. It's 
very challenging." 
</P>

ALBUM REVIEWS; A STYLISH TRIBUTE TO MCRAE

 *** 1/2 Vanessa Rubin, "I'm Glad There Is You," Novus. Subtitled "A Tribute to 
Carmen McRae," this is a stylish, well-programmed set.Although Rubin makes no 
attempt to imitate her idol, there is a slight resemblance here and there, in 
tone and phrasing. With material such as Charlie Parker's "Yardbird Suite," 
Thad Jones's "A Child Is Born" and Kurt Weill's "Speak Low," and with numerous 
guest soloists (Kenny Burrell, Grover Washington, Frank Foster), Rubin had a 
fail-safe project here. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 *** Joe Wilder, "No Greater Love," Evening Star. Long hidden in New York 
studio work, the trumpeter makes a welcome jazz reappearance, with considerable 
help from pianist Bobby Tucker and James Chirillo on guitar. The program is a 
well-diversified mix of sextet, trio and duet numbers, ranging from Benny 
Carter's "The Courtship," with saxophonist Seldon Powell switching to flute, 
and "Thinking of Lady," a touching tribute to Billie Holiday. The album would 
have been even better had Wilder displayed more of his elegant open-horn style 
instead of using the mute.

 *** Abbey Lincoln, Hank Jones, "When There Is Love," Gitanes Jazz. Two of 
jazz's most distinct voices come together in a relaxed program that shows both 
off to advantage.Lincoln's voice, somewhat huskier than in years past, still 
retains its attractive depth and color -- spicy on "C'est Si Bon," warm and 
intimate on her own "A Part of Me." Her struggle to find pitch on "I Should 
Care" makes her delivery even more poignant. Jones, working alone on "Close 
Your Eyes," proves himself an astute spokesman, juggling rhythms and soloing in 
almost conversational tunes. "Angel Face," with words by Lincoln and music by 
Jones, is especially heavenly.

THEATER BEAT: 'BABY' A TANGLE OF COMMERCE, PARENTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite its frequently hilarious depiction of all-American culture clash -- 
pitting a childless yuppie couple against an overly fertile white trash family 
-- Jane Anderson's "The Baby Dance" is a serious meditation on the moral tangle 
that results when the values of commerce are misapplied to the role of 
parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, procreation starts to look a lot like Supermarket Sweep when Rachel 
(Cynthia Forbes) and Richard (J. David Krassner), successful players in the 
movie industry, contract with impoverished Wanda (Jill Remez) and Al (Gavin 
Glennon) to adopt the baby they can't afford to raise. Inevitably, class 
differences in the couples' attitudes toward everything from nutrition to 
racism to economics cause amusing but increasingly ugly rifts. 
</P>
<P>
 In his flawless staging for Theatre 40, director Bud Leslie never lets the 
humor eclipse the darker tone, and he coaxes complex and thoroughly believable 
performances from his talented cast. Even the lawyer/baby broker (Artur 
Cybulski) has a sympathetic streak beneath his smarmy manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's sharp dialogue never falters, but some rethinking needs to go into 
the brief finale, which discloses a plot outcome but adds nothing to a dramatic 
arc that ended emotionally with the previous scene.  
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Anderson admirably sustains an effective though unsettling refusal 
to let us off the hook with easy half-truths. Al and Wanda may be deplorable 
specimens, but their narrow-minded perceptions are often better grounded in 
real-life experience than Rachel's insulated wishful thinking. Likewise, 
Richard's high-minded concern for doing the right thing becomes suspect when he 
starts quizzing his lawyer about other possible babies on the adoption block. 
</P>
<P>
 In this ethical no man's land, no one's hands are clean. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Baby Dance," Theatre 40, 241 Moreno Drive, Beverly Hills. 
Sundays-Tuesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Sept. 27. $10. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 1 
hour, 55 minutes. 'Goodrich & Price' a Warm Reminiscence 
</P>
<P>
 The honed performance skills of a show-biz veteran and the compelling impact 
of a well-told personal narrative prove a combination hard to resist in 
"Goodrich & Price and the Child," Lu Leonard's smart and funny one-woman homage 
to a childhood spent on the road with her actor parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Goodrich and Hal Price were never household names, but they had the talent 
to make "life itself big time, with love at the top of the bill." Their life as 
traveling vaudeville performers doing up to four shows a day left little 
opportunity for conventional parenting, yet Little Lu had no regrets about 
spending most of her first eight years in dressing rooms. She loved the 
excitement and all the colorful characters -- magicians, Hungarian acrobats and 
a certain Captain Horatio who kept tossing the fish meant for his trained 
pelican into the footlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by the honesty and simplicity in David Galligan's staging at Chandler 
Studio and accompanied by pianist Greg Schreiner, Leonard re-creates these 
eccentrics with appealing enthusiasm, and her affection for that "innocent 
world that no longer exists" is ultimately contagious. 
</P>

THEATER BEAT: 'THE LETTER': CRISIS HITS MODEL FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY * "Agency," Coast Playhouse, 8325 W. Santa Monica Blvd., 
West Hollywood. Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Sept. 28. (213) 660-8587. Running time: 
1 hour, 5 minutes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 1950s period portrait of a family in crisis, "The Letter," at the Hudson, is 
a florid combination of modernism and melodrama that succeeds despite its 
shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, the family in Rodney Nugent's play appears to be the African 
American version of "The Donna Reed Show." Dad (Steven Williams), a successful 
supervisor in charge of dozens of men, tells his three sons rousing stories of 
their illustrious ancestor, a cowboy in the Old West. Pretty, perfect mom 
(Cyndi James Gossett), a full-time housewife, wears a starched house dress and 
heels at all times. Never mind that this rugged, romping Dad is also a 
domineering disciplinarian whose heavy-handed, humiliating tactics alienate his 
adolescent sons Raymond (Wolfgang Bodison) and James (Craig Thomas). Never mind 
that Model Mom feels obliged to defer to Model Husband, even when convinced of 
his folly. 
</P>
<P>
 With the sudden death of Stevie (Jamil Luis Smith), the adored youngest son, 
the family descends into despair, alcoholism, drug addiction, crime and 
suicide. Protagonist-narrator Raymond relates the sad tale of his family's 
decline and fall in a letter to his childhood sweetheart Janis (Vanessa 
Williams -- of "Melrose Place") on the eve of his execution for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Nugent was a principal dancer with the Alvin Ailey company. Director Charles 
Randolph-Wright also trained at the Ailey School, where he met Nugent. Not 
surprisingly, the two demonstrate a dancer-like command of rhythm, in both text 
and staging. Nugent's characters are compelling and his dialogue is fluid, 
although his obvious plot choices sometimes staunch the flow of this epistolary 
drama. Randolph-Wright also makes some obvious choices, allowing his otherwise 
superb cast to occasionally blunder into caricature. Even so, beautiful 
composition, brisk pacing and endearing performances ensure that "The Letter" 
remains a special delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Letter," Hudson Theatre, 6539 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Sept. 25. $15. (213) 
660-8587. Running time: 1 hour, 55 minutes. (An alternate cast will play on 
various evenings.) 'Agency' Characters Entertain at Coast 
</P>
<P>
 "Agency," Jeff Trachta's comedic one-man show at the Coast Playhouse, is 
another directorial credit for Charles Randolph-Wright ("The Letter"). 
</P>
<P>
 Trachta is a regular on "The Bold and the Beautiful," but don't mistake him 
for just another pretty boy soap star. An impressionist and singer as well as 
an actor, Trachta displays a vocal versatility to rival the late Mel Blanc's.  
</P>
<P>
 Set in a Hollywood Agency from 1984 to the present, Trachta's tale is a 
predictable retread of the old "boy goes Hollywood and loses soul" story. The 
play would be more effective if played strictly as a cartoon, and Trachta 
sacrifices some of his comic momentum by taking his little fable far too 
seriously.

 Although Trachta may sometimes lose sight of the fact, the thin plot is merely 
a clothesline on which he hangs out a formidable succession of characters, the 
most entertaining of which is the hilarious Lydia, a talent agency receptionist 
with a heart of gold and a voice of gravel.  
</P>
<P>
 Everybody's mother hen but nobody's fool, Lydia proceeds to upstage and 
outshine the other characters in the show -- even though they are all played by 
the same person. Hail Lydia. She should live long and go to series. F. KATHLEEN

Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Sept. 28. (213) 660-8587. Running time: 1 hour, 5

THEATER BEAT: 'CADA QUIEN SU VIDA' AN ENSEMBLE EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In offering both English- and Spanish-language versions of its productions, 
Teatro Nosotros deserves praise for reaching out to wider audiences -- an 
expansive impulse very much in keeping with the spirit of "Cada Quien Su Vida" 
(To Each His Own Life) and its creator, the late Mexican playwright Luis G. 
Basurto. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in a dive bar on New Year's Eve, the play is somewhat reminiscent of 
William Saroyan's "The Time of Your Life" in its episodic, slice-of-life 
portraits of down-and-out customers -- hookers, pimps, sleazy politicians and 
hopeless dreamers -- and its compassionate affirmations of the good in human 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Only four of the 23 Spanish-language cast members have changed, and the piece 
remains very much an ensemble effort despite individual variances in 
performance quality. Navigating Gilbert Avila's original English translation 
proves slow going at times, with some naturalness and nuance getting lost in 
the struggle for pronunciation. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Cada Quien Su Vida," Teatro Nosotros, 1314 N. Wilton Place, Hollywood, 
Fridays, Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Sept. 18. $10. (213) 465-4167. 
Running time: 2 hours, 55 minutes. PHILIP BRANDES

THEATER REVIEWS; GANGSTER COMEDY SHOOTS HOLES IN ITS MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carol Wolf, who wrote the ingenious, inventive one-man play, "Monsieur 
Shaherazad," that premiered at Garden Grove's Gem Theatre last year, has a new 
play running at the Tribune Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eddie & Molly's Garden" is no "Shaherazad." It's a sort of hybrid 
satire-farce-sendup subtitled "A Gangster Comedy in Two Acts." The play takes 
some very serious thoughts about today's social ills, twists them ferociously 
and hopes for laughs. Most of them come from the performances, which manage to 
make the play look better than it really is. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie is one of two gangsters who run the State of Old Jersey, which is 
between New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Eddie runs the legislature, Julian runs 
industry. They accomplish this by rubbing out anyone who doesn't fit in. 
</P>
<P>
 This includes recalcitrant politicos, school superintendents, publishers who 
reject Eddie's love poems to his adored Molly, and even students who don't 
study. The illiteracy rate in the state is, Eddie say, .002. "Wait," he growls, 
"till I find those eight guys." 
</P>
<P>
 These gangsters are out of Raymond Chandler, and that's part of the sendup. 
Maybe their methods are what we need, is Wolf's skewed message, her look at 
life through shattered glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 The big problem is that "Garden" often takes itself too seriously, forgetting 
that laughs are what get satire's points over. The play could be cut into a 
long one-act without losing a thing except its humorless moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Williamson has knowledgeably directed the properly driving rhythms that 
propel the play's better moments but has been able to bring only a few in his 
cast under its comic spell. These few play the comedy sincerely without getting 
serious, with the intuitive faux-reality style that makes comedy work. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Corey Smith is a fine Eddie, issuing ludicrous orders out of the 
side of his mouth, with a restraint and lightness that not only brings Wolf's 
writing to life, but also finds its most subtle humor. 
</P>
<P>
 His bumbling assistant Diggory, played by John Vorwald, is the comic delight 
of the evening. Vorwald (who alternates in the role with Mark Nielsen) has an 
innate sense of humor that finds everything Diggory does funny: his blankness, 
his stupefying naivete, his desperately forlorn life. Vorwald believes ardently 
in every moment, and that is what makes him funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Without giving away too much of the intricate plot, Mike Cunningham is also 
very good as Hinchely, the white-bread government agent who has fooled around 
with practically everyone in sight in order to infiltrate the state's power 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 His romancing of the fragile, lonely Diggory provide the evening's funniest 
moments. Michael Hoctor, as Eddie's treacherous partner, Julian, is also very 
funny and very strong -- sometimes a little too strong -- as the archetypal 
greedy mobster with a disastrous heart of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 The women in the cast do not fare as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Goodman's squeaky Jersey piping and gum-chewing are a pointless 
stereotype. Though Marlena Schiff has a few very good moments, she hasn't found 
a solid core to anchor her performance as Susan, Julian's convent-raised 
daughter who has decided to leave the church and take over the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Decker does the usual pants-hitching and smirking as Julian's henchman 
Vic. Eddie's Molly, who unknowingly has spent 20 years telling Eddie whom to 
erase, is an illogical, impossibly written role, a woman who is supposed to be 
an executive, but who is so opaque she never has made the connection between 
her suggestions and the pile of corpses. Amber Wagoner hasn't been able to make 
Molly work any more than the playwright has. 
</P>

Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 5 p.m. Ends Sept. 11. $10. (714)

THEATER REVIEWS; CAMPY, SHABBY, PUN-FILLED 'NUN' COULD BE MORE FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 There's summer camp, and then there's summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Gilray's and Richard Witter's ". . . And Then There Was Nun," at Long 
Beach Playhouse's Studio Theatre, probably seems outrageous enough to an 
audience not terribly used to seeing a male actor playing Bette Davis, who in 
this farce's universe is reputedly the head of the Whip-In-Hand Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Outrageous, maybe. But "Nun" is actually very traditional -- that is, in the 
Charles Busch-Charles Ludlum comedy tradition of crass and cross-dressed 
sniping and spoofing. The high heels fit everyone, darling, and we mean 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the high heels might also be suitable murder instruments -- and 
murder eventually becomes the real issue in "Nun." A comedy with a cast of 
starry Hollywood characters -- all members of the Sisters of St. Andreas -- 
singing "weapons are a girl's best friend" in throaty overkill isn't too 
concerned if the furniture is mussed up with a few bloodstains. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Alfred Hitchcock (Steven Jay Warner) informs us that this order of 
special nuns began when Rebecca was attacked by Norman Bates at the Hollywood 
sign. (Bring along your Leonard Maltin movie guide to catch all of the puns.) 
Just then, a quake knocked over the sign's first "L," spelling "Holywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Puns spewed fast and furious are about all Act I amounts to. While Sister 
Vivien Leigh (Dani Ballew) tries to host and Hattie McDaniel (Keenan Zeno) 
tries to pick up after everybody, Sisters Bette Davis and Joan Crawford (David 
W. Morgan and Michael Treat Latsch) re-enact their own private version of the 
Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 Sisters Tallulah Bankhead (Steve Simonson), Mae West (Mary Tuck), Marilyn 
Monroe (Camille Vernick) and Judy Garland (Kevin Dulude) toss their comments in 
occasionally while the Bette-Joan war rages. And everyone considers Elaine 
Melvold's Gloria Swanson to be mad (lots of pre-Andrew Lloyd Webber "Sunset 
Boulevard" punning here). 
</P>
<P>
 But when murder most foul enters this sisterly retreat, it's Sister Katharine 
Hepburn (Sigrid K. Zahner) who takes charge. Finally, after much belabored 
camp, "Nun" starts becoming a play that looks suspiciously like Agatha 
Christie's "Ten Little Indians." Everything else in this show is a reference or 
in-house joke; why not the plot? 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, each star gets knocked off, and Gilray and Witter are so faithful 
to their inspiration that the killings duplicate Christie. But because these 
are stars, the victims always get one last word in before they keel over. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the actors milk that last word dry. Morgan, Latsch and Zahner don't 
provide the most complete impersonations (those are served up by Vernick's 
Marilyn and Tuck's Mae), but they know camp and how to take charge of the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zeno's Hattie is the most crowd-pleasing comic, but there's no irony to his 
bug-eyed approach when Hattie gets scared. Melvold puts her Gloria in an 
appropriate daze. The others are basically impersonations, with Warner's 
Hitchcock the weakest of the bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 But what really deflates the full summer-camp appeal is director Hugh 
Harrison's refusal to speed up the pace when the farce demands it; that, and an 
unfortunately cheap-looking design, care of Ed Gatica's lights, Greg McCurley's 
sound and nobody on set design. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Fritsche as "costume coordinator" puts together some effective 
ensembles, but it's not enough. As Laguna Playhouse's recent production of 
Ludlum's "The Mystery of Irma Vep" showed, you can milk the camp a lot more if 
you look great while doing it.

THEATER; WILLIAMS, NOT BRANDO, LAID TRACKS FOR 'STREETCAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marlon Brando's autobiography, due next week from Random House, ought to have 
some deep thoughts about Stanley Kowalski and "A Streetcar Named Desire," the 
role and the play that made the actor famous nearly half a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But if "Songs My Mother Taught Me" turns out, like most celebrity memoirs, to 
offer more titillation than revelation, South Coast Repertory playgoers still 
have Jerry Patch to fall back on. 
</P>
<P>
 Patch, the troupe's longtime dramaturge, has written some brief but intriguing 
newsletter notes for SCR's season-opening revival of "Streetcar," which begins 
previews tonight on the Mainstage in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this play is arguably the most perfect play we have in the American 
theater, which is not to say it's easy to do," Patch said in an interview 
earlier this week. "Many 'Streetcar' revivals have not been successful." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent proof was a disappointing 1992 Broadway revival that defied 
the Hollywood star power of both Jessica Lange and Alec Baldwin, according to 
various reviewers who found them a dull pair and the production a museum piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1973, Tennessee Williams could be heard guffawing at the "Streetcar" 
revival mounted in Los Angeles at the Ahmanson Theatre with Faye Dunaway and 
Jon Voight. The playwright apparently didn't like Dunaway's interpretation of 
Blanche Dubois, Stanley's nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Voight's interpretation of Stanley, then-Times theater critic Dan 
Sullivan wrote that it was "a parody of Marlon Brando's original performance . 
. . complete with dese-dem-and-dose accent, but lacking Brando's intensity."  
</P>
<P>
 One of the key challenges in staging "Streetcar," Patch said, "particularly 
for the actor doing Stanley, is to forget Brando ever did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Williams wrote a character that had never been on the American stage before. 
He created an archetype -- this really elemental, masculine man. Everybody 
credits Brando for the character. He had an animal presence on the stage. But 
what he did was essentially what Williams wrote. Brando became the archetype, 
when it's Stanley who is the archetype." 
</P>
<P>
 Brutish and bullying, Stanley Kowalski is more than just a sullen, 
flag-waving, hairy-chested lout who resents Blanche calling him a "Polack." He 
is a primitive, menacing force of nature -- crude and powerful and magnetic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If, as the critic Harold Clurman once said, "his mentality provides the soil 
for fascism, viewed not as a political movement but as a state of being," he is 
nonetheless a naive victim of his own worst impulses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audience loves Stanley for an act and a half," Patch said. "And then it 
begins to realize he's a rather dangerous man." 
</P>
<P>
 For all his sexual swaggering, Stanley is as emotionally needy as Blanche, his 
high-strung, temperamental opposite. She, too, is an archetype -- the 
neurasthenic embodiment of disenfranchised Southern aristocracy. Her gentility 
and sensitivity are real, if ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clurman also noted, if the audience is too well entertained by Stanley's 
"low jeering" and believes with him that Blanche is nothing more than a 
hysterical phony, the whole point of the play is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while Williams identifies with Blanche's desperate loneliness -- her 
longing for love and fulfillment are his as much as hers -- he never fails to 
plumb the depth of Stanley's feelings or frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Williams was even-handed," Patch said. "He showed both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 This SCR revival, starring Kandis Chappell as Blanche and Jeff Meek as 
Stanley, will not be the company's first production of the play. The troupe did 
it in the spring of 1968, during its fifth season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In that revival -- staged by SCR artistic director Martin Benson, who is also 
staging this one -- SCR founding artist Hal Landon Jr. played Stanley; Patch's 
former wife, Cherie, played Blanche. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone familiar with Landon's SCR career in recent years would be hard-pressed 
to imagine him as Stanley. Apart from Scrooge, his perennial star turn in "A 
Christmas Carol," the slightly built, soft-spoken actor has made a specialty 
(comic and otherwise) of lost souls, milquetoasts, dimwits and clergymen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a different sort of actor in 1968," Patch recalled. "He went through a 
philosophical change over the years. We all have. At that time Hal caroused a 
lot. He was a big jock. Then he got to reading Eastern philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
 SCR founding artist Don Took played Mitch, Stanley's pal, in the troupe's 
first "Streetcar." Benson had to take over the role for one performance, 
though, when Took's presence was required at an Army Reserve meeting. This time 
Took is playing the Doctor, and he's no longer in the reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 If you plan to compare the 1951 movie of "Streetcar" with the play, remember 
that the recently restored version is still compromised by changes made in the 
script before shooting began to satisfy Hollywood's Production Code censors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even with the rape scene put back in," Patch said, "you're really getting a 
bowdlerized version of the play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elia Kazan, who directed the original Broadway production, also directed the 
movie. Brando reprised his role. So did Karl Malden (Mitch) and Kim Hunter 
(Blanche's sister Stella, who is married to Stanley). 
</P>
<P>
 But Jessica Tandy, who played Blanche on Broadway, was passed over in favor of 
Vivien Leigh, who had played Blanche in London under her husband Laurence 
Olivier's direction. Leigh, besides being a fine actress, was a screen star. 
Tandy was not, and neither were the others. The producers felt they needed at 
least one recognizable name on the marquee. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; NAPALM DEATH: MOST PURE, PRIMAL OF GRINDCORE BANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "We're Napalm Death from Birmingham, England," singer Barney Greenway growled, 
introducing a song during his band's concert at the Palace on Wednesday. "This 
is 'Suffer . . . the . . . Children'!"  
</P>
<P>
 And suffer it the kids in this hall did, gladly -- every ear-hemorrhaging, 
brain-pounding note of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The style called grindcore is perhaps the purest and most primal hard-rock 
sub-genre, and this veteran quintet may be the purest and most primal grindcore 
band, with songs about, well, what the name would lead you to assume, and a 
beat-the-clock blur of guitars and drums behind Greenway's "Exorcist" roar.  
</P>
<P>
 Even on album the songs all sound pretty much the same. Live, a mix 
emphasizing L.A. native Danny Herrera's double kick-drum flurries made it even 
more so, at times sounding like a CD that got stuck.  
</P>
<P>
 No grindcore band has come close to breaking beyond cult status, but its 
appeal is clear. If you want cathartic release, this is hard to top.  
</P>
<P>
 And the absence of hard-rock's standard, trumped-up sense of menace was a 
plus. Greenway said an earnest "thank you" after most every song and even 
dedicated one number to his unlikely hero, former Journey singer Steve Perry, 
whom he had met earlier in the day. The song was the entirely un-Journey-like 
"Plague Rages," but the sentiment was sweet . . . and pure. STEVE HOCHMAN

KEY SCHOOL DISTRICT REFORM LEADER QUITS; EDUCATION: WILLIAM MAGEE SAYS HE WAS 
NOT GIVEN THE POWER HE NEEDED TO MAKE CHANGES. SUPT. SID THOMPSON SAYS THE 
FORMER ARCO EXECUTIVE HAD UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District's No. 3 officer, a retired Arco 
executive hired to overhaul the district's budget and business operations, 
resigned Thursday because he could not get the authority he said he needed to 
get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 William Magee, chosen by business leaders five months ago to help the 
district's reform efforts, told The Times he felt frustrated in his efforts to 
make changes because he lacked the power to make key personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I could do the job unless I had hiring and firing authority 
over the people who reported to me," Magee said. "I felt I had to be perceived 
as the person with authority as opposed to being a part of the nebulous office 
of the superintendent." 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Sid Thompson said Thursday that he wanted Magee to stay on but that the 
former executive, who is accustomed to working in a private corporation instead 
of a large public agency, sought an unrealistic amount of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that bothered him the most was that he wanted to really control 
everything he dealt with," Thompson said. "First of all, I told him, I am the 
CEO of this district and I'm ultimately accountable for everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, however, praised Magee's contributions and said he is pleased Magee 
has agreed to stay on as an unpaid consultant in several technical areas. 
Thompson said he will not seek to fill the vacant position. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation, the culmination of a conflict that had been simmering almost 
from the start, caused consternation among several key business and education 
leaders because of Magee's close ties to the district's innovative school 
reform effort known as LEARN. 
</P>
<P>
 Magee's primary assignment was closely related to a central concept of LEARN 
-- to shift budget and other decision-making authority to individual schools 
that have voted to participate in the program. In particular, he was working on 
a districtwide computer system to bring financial information to the fingertips 
of principals. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Wycoff, president emeritus of Arco and a founding member of LEARN, 
said Thursday that he was disappointed by the resignation but not surprised. It 
was Wycoff who helped broker the deal that brought Magee to the district under 
a $109,000 annual contract that was to have expired in June, 1995. "To me it's 
an indication that (district officials) just don't realize what is necessary to 
make schools work," Wycoff said. "They just want to stay in the old ways and 
that's what's so sad." 
</P>
<P>
 But he predicted that Magee's resignation will not dampen the business 
community's commitment to LEARN, the acronym for Los Angeles Educational 
Alliance for Restructuring Now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is we are going to make this work," Wycoff said. "We are not 
quitting." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Roos, chief executive officer of LEARN, said that the resignation "points 
up the lack of resolve on the part of the district to do the absolutely 
essential requirements to fully make schools work." 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Mark Slavkin downplayed the significance of the 
resignation and said he doubted it will undermine business leaders' support for 
the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it belittles their commitment to public education to suggest that 
their support is conditioned on the employment status of any one person," 
Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any speculation that this has huge meaning for LEARN or the reform effort is 
a bit overblown," Slavkin said. "What counts is the outcome we create and we 
ought to focus on those instead of on the personalities." 
</P>
<P>
 Magee was controller and a vice president of Arco for six years and oversaw 
all financial, legal and public affairs for the company. His appointment to the 
district was widely praised by business leaders as a step in the right 
direction for the district's tradition-bound bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 His tenure provoked private grumblings among district headquarters staff 
members, who were unaccustomed to his blunt, no-nonsense style. They also 
complained that Magee did not understand the constraints and rules that apply 
to public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Magee also drew fire from the district's Filipino employees when he 
observed in a letter that many people of Filipino descent held jobs in the 
accounting department. The issue had been raised in an anonymous letter from 
another employee. Magee later apologized to Filipino employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Summarizing his experience, Magee said Thursday that he generally found a 
central bureaucracy that was having a difficult time with change. He did say, 
however, that his work with individual LEARN schools was a refreshing 
experience and gave him hope that reform can take hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can point to some beginnings," Magee said. "And I think I established some 
credibility with the educational side of the district, the schools. They took 
me seriously because I was open and honest and I hope I have laid the 
groundwork for change."

U.S. AGREES TO SELL ITS SHARE OF CARD CLUB; GAMING: PROPOSAL CALLS FOR 
GOVERNMENT TO RECEIVE ALMOST $38 MILLION FOR ITS INTEREST IN BICYCLE CLUB. THE 
BUSINESS WAS SEIZED IN 1990. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After more than four troubled years in the casino business, the U.S. 
government has entered into an agreement to sell its controlling interest in 
the Bicycle Club Casino of Bell Gardens to a Santa Monica investment group for 
just under $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials confirmed Thursday that the newly formed investment group, 
Club Acquisition Partners, has been awarded an exclusive right to purchase the 
government's 36.15% interest in California's second-largest card casino. 
</P>
<P>
 The government seized the vast club along the Long Beach Freeway in April, 
1990, after federal prosecutors proved that the casino was built in part with 
laundered drug money from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the Bicycle Club was the largest asset ever forfeited to the 
federal government under racketeering laws. The sale would mark the end of the 
government's profitable, but embarrassing foray into the casino business. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the transaction can be concluded, the investors must be licensed by 
city and state authorities and the deal must receive the approval of a federal 
judge in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of two existing partnerships that together operate the club also will 
have a chance to make an offer for the government's interest. The government 
owns a controlling interest in the larger of the two partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the multiple approvals that are needed, a government source said 
the Justice Department will continue to be involved with the Bicycle Club for 
some time. "It could go on for as much as nine months," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The source said the Santa Monica group's offer was $37.96 million, or $1.05 
million for each percentage point in the casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll Spiller, deputy chief of the seized assets division of the U.S. 
Marshals Service in Washington, confirmed that the sales price was more than $1 
million for each percentage point of the casino. A letter of intent to sell the 
government's interest was signed last week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spiller and other federal officials declined to identify the individual 
investors in the limited partnership headed by Richard Schneider, a Santa 
Monica attorney. Schneider also declined to identify the investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Offers for the government's share of the Bicycle Club were solicited by the 
U.S. Marshals Service and the federal trustee, Harry J. Richard, who oversees 
the casino's operations on a day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous inquiries were received, but a source said fewer than a dozen offers 
were seriously considered at a meeting in Las Vegas two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those bidding for the government's interest was Hollywood Park, which 
operates the Inglewood racetrack and contracts with a management firm to run a 
newly opened card casino there. Hollywood Park's offer was rejected because 
California law prohibits publicly traded companies from owning a card club, the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal from the Bicycle Club's employees to purchase the government's 
share of the casino also was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the federal government has earned at least $25 million in profits 
from the club, in addition to the nearly $38 million expected from the sale, 
government officials expressed an eagerness to get out of the casino business 
when The Times in June disclosed their continuing role in the troubled club. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a level of discomfort," Chief Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven E. 
Zipperstein said at the time. "This is not the type of activity that law 
enforcement agencies are best suited to conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Zipperstein declined to comment Thursday on the sale agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 During the government's involvement in the Bicycle Club, the Justice 
Department has found itself investigating alleged criminal activity in a 
business it partially owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollman Cheung, operator of the Bicycle Club's lucrative Asian games, was 
indicted in January on loan sharking and extortion charges. His trial is 
scheduled to begin Wednesday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The government had to pay its share of hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
fines to the Internal Revenue Service for the casino's violation of federal 
laws aimed at preventing money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 And as a partner in the casino, the government participated in the club's 
political contributions to defeat ballot measures that would have established 
competing card clubs, including one in the Orange County community of Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 The government trustee also found himself at odds with the casino's former 
general manager, George Hardie, over legislation that would have created a 
state gaming commission to tighten regulation of California card rooms. The 
measure died Wednesday in the final hours of this year's legislative session.  
</P>
<P>
 The casino, with 2,000 employees and gross revenues of more than $90 million a 
year, is crucial to the financial health of Bell Gardens. The small city 
receives more than 60% of its income from taxes on the casino's operations.

LOVING DOVING; OPENING DAY OF SEASON IS A TIME FOR HUNTERS' CAMARADERIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In conspiratorial gatherings, under cover of camouflage and night, the men and 
boys told hushed tales of the elusive bird of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 How it swoops and arcs and dives headlong into the safety of a manzanita. How 
to tell the whitetail from the mourning. How tasty it is, barbecued, with a 
little garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the opening day of dove season Thursday, and hunters arrived as early 
as 4 a.m. at the Antelope Valley Sportsman's Club to prepare for what club 
owner Dave Whiteside sees as a near-sacred ceremony of life, death, friendship 
and pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a prehistoric ritual of guys getting together early in the morning, 
watching the sun rise and enjoying nature," he said. "You go for the 
aesthetics, the camaraderie." 
</P>
<P>
 And, if you're a true hunter as opposed to a trigger-happy blaster, Whiteside 
said, you go prepared for -- even looking forward to -- days like this, when 
most of the birds have nested to escape a blustery west wind or already headed 
south to Mexico, sensing the nearness of autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing," said Joe Toy as he eyed an empty sky and listened to the faint 
thumps of a shotgun in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 After "drinking coffee, eating doughnuts and lying to each other" while 
waiting for daylight, Toy, his brother Norm, and friend Gary Farquhar -- all 
three in the electrical wire business -- loaded their weapons, filled their 
pockets with shells and headed into the brush west of Lancaster to seek their 
fist-size prey. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours later, not a bird in the bush, let alone in their hands, the three 
returned to smoking cigarettes and swapping tales of minor birdshot wounds 
suffered at the hands of said trigger-happy blasters. And of doves. 
</P>
<P>
 "They fly fast, they make quick turns -- they're hard to hit," said Norm Toy. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrolling the brush and withering scrub oaks around a natural spring that is 
nearly dry, a civil engineer from Northridge and his 17-year-old son discussed 
the average number of shots needed to down a dove, settling on 9.5. 
</P>
<P>
 The father and son had each bagged just one after four hours, and shot at a 
few others. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll have a line of guys, everyone will get off two or three shots, and 
he'll still be flying," said the engineer, Don Kalanick. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as he finished speaking, a voice 100 yards down a gully called out 
"Behind you!" Kalanick wheeled, leveled his double-barrel, and fired one shot. 
The dove dropped, leaving a small halo of gray feathers hanging 10 feet in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not bad for an old guy," the civil engineer shrugged, wrapping one arm around 
his smiling son. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience of shooting a dove draws hunters daily to the 1,250-acre 
hunting ranch during the two-week September dove season. (Another season begins 
Nov. 1 and ends Dec. 26.) 
</P>
<P>
 They find there a quirky meeting place of old and new, of tradition and 
change, of 1990s Los Angeles and turn-of-the-century Wild West. The clubhouse 
sits on the site of an old stage stop, and members pull up to it in 
$25,000air-conditioned pickups. Hunters wear camouflage T-shirts, to which they 
pin paper numbers so Whiteside and crew know who's where and who's who. 
</P>
<P>
 And while insisting that the drive to hunt is at least partly instinctual, 
hunters at the club acknowledge that paying $575 for a season of hunting is not 
the way early humans got their protein. 
</P>
<P>
 But early humans didn't live in a county of 9 million people, they note. And 
besides, going home with dinner is hardly the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for kids and their dads," said Kalanick's son, Corey. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Corey added that it's not easy to explain the appeal of the sport to his 
Granada Hills High School classmates, most of whom have never held a shotgun, 
nor flushed a dove from its roost. And many would never want to, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiteside has heard all the criticisms before, and for each he has an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we have a gun in our hands, some consider us on the level of felons," 
he said. "If you equate fun with killing, there's something wrong with you. . . 
. Your true hunter doesn't just shoot things -- he cleans it and eats it and 
relishes it."

TUNNELING TO RESUME SOON, EXPERTS SAY; METRO RAIL: THE SUBWAY OPENINGS UNDER 
HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD HAVE BEEN STABILIZED, MTA SAYS. OFFICIALS SEE NO FURTHER 
PROBLEMS WITH SINKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Engineers concluded Thursday that twin subway tunnels beneath Hollywood 
Boulevard are "in no danger of collapse" -- despite the ground having sunk nine 
inches in one spot -- and that tunneling beneath the famed thoroughfare can 
resume by the middle of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-week review, a panel of tunnel and soil experts reported that the 
subsidence resulted from loosely packed, sandy earth and soil drenched by 
ruptured water and fire lines in the area. The panel also blamed soils 
compacted by construction work and the failure of wooden wedges in the tunnels 
to hold under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the board told the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that the 
tunnels have been stabilized. With a few remedial measures, the panel said, 
boring can continue without danger of a repeat of last month's settling, which 
forced the closure of several blocks of the boulevard near Hudson Avenue, the 
evacuation of dozens of residents and the rescue of sidewalk stars along 
Hollywood's Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The review board recommended that engineers re-grout a 200-foot stretch of one 
tunnel between Wilcox and Whitley avenues, where steel reinforcing columns were 
erected to shore up the tunnel liner. Workers were advised to pack surrounding 
soil to keep the earth more firmly in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will implement the board's recommendations over the next several days in 
order to resume our tunneling operations by mid-September," Edward McSpedon, 
the MTA's chief executive officer for construction, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 As workers tunnel westward, careful mining should cause the ground to sink one 
to two inches, which the review board characterized as an acceptable level of 
subsidence based on past experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunneling was suspended Aug. 20 after complaints by residents and merchants 
that the construction was causing more damage than the Northridge earthquake. 
Tenants on the boulevard reported cracks in floors and walls, criticizing a 
costly transit project that has been plagued by accusations of poor safety and 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities sealed off nine blocks of Hollywood Boulevard from traffic a day 
later and ordered evacuation of 45 residents from a historic apartment 
building. More than two dozen businesses have filed claims with the MTA for 
lost revenue as a result of the closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Although two lanes of the four-lane boulevard are now open, some merchants 
complain that barricades continue to drive away potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no business on the street because of this. We have a barricade not 3 
1/2 feet from our window and our front entrance," said Ron Martek, co-owner of 
By George!, a menswear store. "People are walking by but hardly notice we're 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials said they will continue to monitor buildings and street surfaces 
in the area.

PROSECUTORS GET REPORTS ON MYSTERY ENVELOPE; SIMPSON CASE: SOURCES SAY CONTENTS 
ARE DESCRIBED AS A STILETTO KNIFE AND A RECEIPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After two months of waiting for a look inside a mysterious envelope presented 
during O.J. Simpson's preliminary hearing, prosecutors got the next best thing 
Thursday: Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito released to them copies of reports 
that describe the envelope's contents in detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito did not make the reports public, but defense sources have long said the 
envelope contains a knife identical to one that prosecutors displayed in court 
during the preliminary hearing. The Times reported that on July 3, and sources 
confirmed Thursday that the reports turned over to prosecutors describe a 
15-inch Stiletto knife, along with a receipt for its purchase from a Downtown 
store, Ross Cutlery. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those reports was prepared by a specially appointed retired judge who 
examined the items when they were presented to him. Another was prepared by a 
court-appointed expert who also attended that examination. Prosecutors did not 
receive a third report on the knife, one explaining how it came into the 
possession of the court-appointed special master. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prosecutors have eagerly sought to discover what is inside the 
envelope, the value of the knife as evidence is difficult to assess. That is in 
part because prosecutors have not made clear whether they intend to argue that 
a knife such as the one Simpson allegedly bought May 3 actually was used in the 
slashing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Two related defense motions filed earlier this week were made public for the 
first time. One seeks dismissal of the charges against Simpson based on the 
evidence presented during his preliminary hearing. The other argues that 
evidence seized in several searches of Simpson's home and car should be 
excluded from the case because police acted improperly in conducting those 
searches. 
</P>
<P>
 * A witness called to appear at a grand jury investigating Simpson's friend Al 
Cowlings refused to testify and was held in contempt of court. He is appealing 
that order. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ito said he expected to announce today any limitations that he may put on 
lawyers and others involved in the case. Initially, Ito had circulated a broad 
gag order that also would have required all motions to be filed under seal, but 
after hearing some criticism of that proposal he agreed to consider the matter 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 The motions released Thursday lay the groundwork for the next major battles in 
the case. Starting Sept. 19, defense attorneys are expected to argue that 
police acted improperly in searching Simpson's property and that the case 
against him should be dismissed because insufficient evidence was presented 
during the preliminary hearing to warrant holding him for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts give the motion to dismiss the case little chance of succeeding, 
but the motion unveiled Thursday explains the defense reasoning, most of which 
relies on its contention that Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell allowed 
improperly seized evidence to be introduced against Simpson during the 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 If those items -- especially a bloody glove found outside Simpson's home -- 
are excluded, there is not enough evidence left to warrant Simpson facing 
murder charges, defense attorneys argued. 
</P>
<P>
 That argument dovetails with the defense contention that searches of Simpson's 
home and car were unlawful and therefore any evidence yielded by them should 
not be used against the former football star. As they did during the 
preliminary hearing, Simpson's lawyers argued in the second motion released 
Thursday that police improperly entered his Brentwood estate before dawn on 
June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police detectives say they went to Simpson's home to tell him of 
his ex-wife's death, to inform him that his children were being held at a 
nearby police station, and to make sure that no other people were injured or in 
danger at his house. When they received no response after ringing the bell for 
several minutes, one of the officers leaped the fence and all four of them went 
onto the grounds without a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys maintain that the real reason was to search for evidence 
against Simpson and that the warrantless search early that morning was 
therefore illegal. Moreover, they maintain that Detective Philip L. Vannatter 
lied in obtaining two subsequent warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orenthal James Simpson unequivocally insists that he is absolutely 100% not 
guilty of the crimes of which he has been accused," the motion by Simpson's 
legal team states. "At the same time, he insists that his guilt or innocence be 
determined on the basis of evidence that was lawfully acquired." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of the warrantless search -- which turned up a bloody glove, among 
other things -- was argued during Simpson's preliminary hearing. Because the 
judge at that time found no fault with the officers' conduct, defense attorneys 
have an uphill battle before Ito. 
</P>
<P>
 But the motion released Thursday says that Simpson's lawyers expect to offer 
additional evidence "relating to the credibility of the LAPD detectives who 
engaged in the warrantless entry and search." In addition, the newly released 
motion attacks subsequently obtained search warrants on several grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Attached to the motions are property reports showing the evidence seized under 
those warrants. They include hairs and fibers recovered from Simpson's Ford 
Bronco, clothing taken from Simpson's home and copies of videotapes from a film 
that Simpson had recently finished shooting. That film, "Frogmen," includes a 
scene in which Simpson holds a knife to a young woman's throat. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual development Thursday, the attorney for the man who was found in 
contempt said his client had refused to testify because he was fearful for his 
life.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's not afraid of anyone involved in the case, but others," lawyer Robert 
Rentzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 His client gave prosecutors information "remotely related" to the Simpson 
case, on the condition that his identity would be concealed. He has no 
information about Cowlings or anyone else in the case, the lawyer said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
FIREFIGHTERS NAMED IN ARSON CASE TO FILE CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An attorney for two firefighters named as arson suspects in the devastating 
Calabasas-Malibu fire last fall said this week that he will bring legal action 
against Los Angeles County for damage to their reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Feldman, who represented the boy who won a multimillion-dollar 
out-of-court settlement in a molestation claim against superstar Michael 
Jackson, said he expects to file a claim against the county within two weeks, a 
required first step before a lawsuit.A suit can be filed if the county fails to 
respond to the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Shelp, a Los Angeles County firefighter, and Nicholas Durepo, a 
volunteer firefighter in Manhattan Beach, were identified by sheriff's 
officials as suspected arsonists in one of the worst fires in Los Angeles 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither man was charged with a crime, and the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office recently announced that officials had insufficient evidence 
to prosecute and were no longer investigating them. The announcement did not 
exonerate the men, who have denied that they set the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's spokesman said the department has received no formal notice of the 
action and had no comment.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CULVER CITY; WIDOW OF 
'FRIENDLY FIRE' CASUALTY CRITICIZES PAYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The widow of Iraq "friendly fire" victim Erik Scott Mounsey is angry and wants 
to know why a foreigner's life is worth more than her husband's. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an insult," said Kaye Mounsey after learning that she will receive 
$12,000 for the death of her husband while the families of foreigners who died 
in the April tragedy each will receive $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government issued a statement Friday saying that families of the 11 
foreigners killed in the downing of two U.S. Army helicopters by U.S. Air Force 
jets each would be paid $100,000. In the same announcement, Defense Secretary 
William J. Perry said the families of the 15 U.S. servicemen killed that day 
would have their gratuity payments doubled to $12,000 -- $88,000 less than 
their French, British, Turkish and Kurdish counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Warrant Officer Erik Mounsey, an Army pilot, was flying one of two UH-60 Black 
Hawk helicopters shot down over northern Iraq. In all, 26 people died. On 
Monday, a military board recommended that as many as five AWACS crew members be 
court-martialed for their part in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are laws that limit what the government can do for the survivors. Each 
of the families has gotten what is allowable under the law," Pentagon spokesman 
Maj. Tom La-Rock said. According to another Pentagon spokesman, all but one of 
the families is getting $200,000 in insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mounsey said the insurance should not be considered compensation from the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We paid for that policy. And it's not even five years of salary," she said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VALENCIA; CALARTS TO 
GET $25 MILLION FOR EARTHQUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California Institute of the Arts, the Valencia college heavily damaged during 
the Northridge earthquake, has been awarded almost $25 million in federal funds 
for repairs, officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA spokesman Russ Edmonston said the private arts college has been 
authorized to receive more than $24.9 million to rebuild earthquake-damaged 
structures.The majority of the funds -- about $23 million -- will repair 
structural damage to CalArts' 500,000-square-foot main building. 
</P>
<P>
 As quake repairs began, courses were held in a variety of impromptu locations. 
Temple Beth Shalom in Newhall, a vacant Lockheed research center in Valencia, 
the Magic Moments Theatre at Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park, the Santa 
Clarita YMCA, a health club at the Vista Village shopping center and Le Studio 
in Pasadena all served as CalArts classrooms in the weeks after the temblor.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; HOSPITAL 
CLINIC REOPENS; CAUSE OF ODORS INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A clinic at County-USC Medical Center reopened Thursday as authorities 
searched for the cause of an odor that prompted hundreds to flee and 34 people 
to experience breathing problems and burning eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some said it smelled like natural gas or bleach," said Harvey Kern, a 
spokesman for the medical center.However, natural gas was ruled out as the 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 workers, patients and family members fled the two-story clinic after 
the odor was detected about 11 a.m. Wednesday. The clinic provides outpatient 
pediatric and family planning care. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of firefighters and hazardous material crews responded to the scene and 
took 34 people, including 13 hospital employees, to County-USC's main hospital 
and to three other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 They suffered from "mild to moderate symptoms" such as coughing, watering eyes 
and nausea, Kern said. All were treated and released.

FIRE LEAVES 50 PEOPLE HOMELESS; BLAZE: NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED. RED CROSS HAS 
SET UP SHELTER FOR RESIDENTS OF TWO COVINA APARTMENT BUILDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Up to 50 people were left homeless by a fire that badly damaged two Covina 
apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Police described the neighborhood where the complexes are located as generally 
impoverished."This is a tragedy," Covina Police Sgt. Chuck Rosales said. 
"Everything that these people have is in those four walls." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 firefighters battled the blaze that began about 9:30 a.m., 
bringing it under control within an hour. No one was injured, but structural 
damage was estimated at $890,000. The cause of the blaze is under 
investigation, Covina Fire Chief Ken Lavoie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Phyllis Alba, 27, said the fire started in her apartment. She said 
she had just returned from the store when she noticed a blaze in her kitchen. 
She had been frying potatoes before she went to the store, she said, but the 
stove was off and the pan was removed from the burner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost everything," said Alba, a mother of five who is on welfare. "I had 
just bought my children school clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze started in one of the six units in a complex at 365 N. Vecino Drive 
and quickly spread to a 14-unit complex next door at 654 Ruddock St. Both 
buildings have shake shingle roofs, which helped fuel the blaze, Lavoie said. 
All 20 units, some of which were empty, were declared at least temporarily 
uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Red Cross set up a shelter a couple of blocks away for those who 
had nowhere else to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I'm going to do," said Blanca Johnson, 36, as she and her 
seven children sat in plastic chairs at the shelter. Johnson said she lost her 
job working in a candy factory three weeks ago.

D.A.'S OFFICE HIRED 'FOCUS GROUP' IN SIMPSON CASE; ACQUITTAL FAVORED; COURTS: 
PHOENIX GROUP MADE DECISION BASED ON WHAT THEY KNEW AT THE TIME. DIFFERING 
OPINIONS ABOUT CLARK AND SHAPIRO ARE OFFERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 To gauge how media coverage of the O.J. Simpson murder case might be affecting 
potential jurors, a consultant for the prosecution recently queried 17 Phoenix 
residents about the proceedings and learned that most would acquit the former 
athlete based on what they knew at the time, according to two members of the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Kingston, a 33-year-old real estate agent, said in an interview that 
about a dozen participants said they would not convict Simpson. Kingston said 
he was one of three or four members who said they could not decide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I couldn't find him guilty based on what I knew, but that I 
didn't know if he was scot-free innocent either," Kingston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, most of the 17 men and women indicated that they were put 
off by Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark and charmed by one of Simpson's lead 
defense lawyers, Robert L. Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to give a one-word description of Clark, Kingston said, most of the 
group members used negative terminology. He said some of the words used were 
pushy and aggressive . Words used to describe Shapiro, Kingston said, were 
smooth , chutzpah and sharp . 
</P>
<P>
 The participants also said they were suspicious of Los Angeles Police 
Detective Mark Fuhrman, who has testified that he found an incriminating bloody 
glove at Simpson's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The responses, Kingston said, were based on what he and the 16 others knew 
about the case from news reports, with only a few facts provided by the 
questioners. The six-hour session was held Aug. 19 at a Phoenix hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office confirmed Thursday that the "focus group" took 
place, but said in a statement that "no verdicts or ballots" were taken. The 
statement said the group was put together to assess "attitudes created by the 
media coverage of the case." 
</P>
<P>
 A law enforcement source who did not want to be identified said prosecutors 
also wanted to find out attitudes toward "certain evidence and personalities." 
</P>
<P>
 Kingston confirmed that no written ballots were taken, but he insisted that 
people were verbally polled about the verdict they would return. His account 
was confirmed by another member of the group, Charles Scruggs, a Phoenix truck 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the June 12 murders of his ex-wife, Nicole 
Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman in a case that has attracted 
unprecedented media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Grimes, a Santa Ana-based lawyer who has used focus groups in his 
cases, said the outcome of the session in the Simpson case does not necessarily 
bode ill for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you do something that gives you feedback on the weaknesses in your 
case, it helps you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Focus groups are most often used by corporations in civil cases, because few 
others can afford the expense, Grimes said. Other legal experts said it was 
rare for the government to employ such a strategy for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, smarting from hung juries in the Menendez brothers 
murder trial, said this year that his office would increasingly turn to outside 
experts in preparing for high-profile trials. 
</P>
<P>
 His office hired Decision Quest, a Torrance-based jury consultant firm, to aid 
prosecutors in the Simpson case. The company that conducted the session in 
Arizona was the Phoenix-based Response Research, said Kingston, who believes he 
and the other participants were chosen at random. They were paid $125 each, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he agreed to take part in the session, he did not know it was for the 
Simpson case, he said. He found out only after he and the other group members 
had arrived at the hotel on a Saturday morning, he said, and filled out "20 or 
30" forms that asked general questions about his attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They presented a multitude of questions, racial questions about if we thought 
the cops acted properly," Kingston said. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if they thought the case has racial overtones because Simpson is 
black, most of the group members -- there were nine blacks and eight whites -- 
said they did not, Kingston said.

10-YEAR-OLD'S QUICK 911 CALL FOILS 6 ARMED INTRUDERS; CRIME: BOY ALERTED TEMPLE 
CITY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES AFTER THE SUSPECTS BROKE INTO HIS HOME AND SEIZED HIS 
TWO BROTHERS. ALL THE SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED; NO ONE WAS HURT.

<P>
 In less than a minute, 10-year-old Robert Chou thwarted six home invasion 
robbers in the only way he knew how: He called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 With little-boy moxie, he directed Temple City sheriff's deputies to his home, 
where six teen-agers with knives and a handgun had just broken in. Robert, in a 
quavering voice, answered the dispatcher's questions -- right up until the 
suspects found him hiding in a fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the boy and his brothers, ages 20 and 14, were unhurt Wednesday, 
and deputies arrested the six teen-agers on suspicion of robbery, said 
Sheriff's Deputy Fidel Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a quick-thinking and composed young man under immense pressure," Sgt. 
Ron Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert's mother, Abby, said she did not want her son to be interviewed because 
he still was upset by the incident. She declined to answer questions about 
Robert or his brothers, saying she was concerned for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son was very scared," said Chou, an office clerk in San Gabriel who was 
working at the time of the robbery. "He was shaking and sweating. This was hard 
for him." 
</P>
<P>
 The drama started about 3 p.m. Wednesday, when the armed suspects broke into 
the house through a small garage window. They grabbed 14-year-old Richard and 
hit him before binding him with electrical cords and duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert, who was watching TV in the den, heard the commotion and ran to alert 
his oldest brother, 20-year-old Roger. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger grabbed an unloaded rifle and directed Robert to call 911. Roger was 
able to hold three of the intruders at bay until the three others came in and 
disarmed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Robert ran for the telephone and slipped into the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 His voice was scared and tentative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello?" he said to the 911 dispatcher. "Um, people just broke into our 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispatcher tried to find out what was going on and where Robert was. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: What are they doing in the house? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert: I think they're going to take stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: Where are you at? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert: I'm, I'm on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: Are you in your bedroom? Where are you at? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert: I'm in the living room. Um, my brother? 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: Uh-huh? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert: He, um, has a gun. Don't worry, it's licensed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: OK, are you guys in the bedroom? Where are you at? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert: I'm in the living room, and my brother's got them freezed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: Has them freezed? With a gun? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert: Uh-huh. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: Your brother's pointing a gun at them? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>
 The call ended with Robert's screams as the teen-agers discovered him and 
ordered him out of the fireplace at knifepoint. 
</P>
<P>
 But the information was enough to get sheriff's deputies rolling. The 
intruders had ransacked the house and started piling up items. But they heard 
the sirens and ran. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrived in time to catch three of the intruders immediately and 
caught the other three after a short chase. The suspects, who range in age from 
14 to 18, are residents of the San Gabriel Valley. Deputies only identified one 
suspect, Thang Thong, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors applauded Robert's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say he's a very quick thinker," said neighbor Michael Schaller, 46, a 
psychologist for Temple City schools. "It turned out well, he's a hero." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Abby Chou is trying to shield her sons from further trauma -- this 
time from the media. Robert is holed up with relatives until everything blows 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want them to forget about this," she said.

 This former Sea View League member receives a boost from two former players. 
The Roadrunners' attack revolves around Caldwell, who returns to the team after 
living in Texas in 1993. As a starter on the varsity in 1992, Caldwell gained 
507 yards in 94 carries (a 5.4-yard average) and scored two touchdowns. "He's 
the only speed we have on the football field," Witte said. "We need 1,000 yards 
from him and we think we can get it." Killingbeck returns after taking a year 
off to concentrate on baseball and basketball. He started at cornerback toward 
the end of his sophomore season, but will play offense exclusively. Witte is 
relying on Killingbeck to operate the Roadrunners' option attack. "We're very 
pleased to have them back," Witte said. "We need them." SCHEDULE

<P>
 Hinman's first two seasons were less than stellar. He's hoping the Saints' 
fortune will change with the move from the Sunset League. Several good battles 
for positions are taking place. "We'd have to flip coins in a lot of spots if 
the season started today," Hinman said. "We've got a lot of things that are 
still undecided." Martinez and Schwalm each have shown leadership ability in 
the quarterback competition. Cabrera and Esparza have similar running styles. 
They are quick and can catch passes coming out of the backfield. Avila and 
Sagrero possess speed and usually catch most passes thrown in their direction. 
Size and strength along the offensive line might be a source of problems.

 The Friars finished fifth in the Sunset League, the highest finish among 
members of the new league. Many coaches pick Servite to win the first league 
title. With 28 returning lettermen, the Friars are deep in experience. The 
offensive line might dominate. Toner believes Lucey is among the league's best. 
Strong and agile, Lucey anchors a line that includes Hawkins and Stotlar, who 
are also solid. Even if the line doesn't always move people, Bedard and Patti 
will get their yards. Both are powerful runners who know how to break free. 
There is also talent on defense. Magliocco and Paul will cause problems for 
even the best offenses. Hoegler provides support against the run and Levecke is 
skilled in covering receivers. Salerno also shows promise. SCHEDULE

 After struggling through some rough seasons in the Sea View League, Tustin has 
a good chance to qualify for the playoffs in the new league's first season. 
Ellis begins his second season in control of the Tillers with lots of talent on 
offense. Timone gained valuable experience as the backup quarterback last 
season and is prepared to take over the lead role, Ellis said. Timone has a 
strong arm and good instincts. "We've got experience at quarterback," Ellis 
said. "That's one of our strengths." Tustin's receivers are another source of 
strength. Roberts and Curry are fast and make the big catches. Wilson provides 
Timone with a big target for tough, short-yardage receptions. Many of the 
offensive linemen are varsity newcomers, but the group shows promise. Staubly 
and Ray are big and physical. Wilson and Stadler should anchor the Tillers' 
defense. They are strong and quick. SCHEDULE

</P>
<P>
 In responding to a preseason questionnaire, Donnelly listed winning five games 
as the Seahawks' team goal. While that might seem unambitious to some, five 
victories in a season at Ocean View is like snow in the Southland--it don't 
happen often. If the Seahawks attain their goal, it would give them five more 
victories than they've had the last three seasons combined. Ocean View, which 
finished last in the Sunset League last season, has lost 29 consecutive games. 
Entering a new league might be just the thing to spark a turnaround; Donnelly 
sure hopes so. "I think we're a lot better than last year," Donnelly said. "I 
think we're going to get a few (victories)." If so, Silva must come through 
with a standout season. Silva, a member of the varsity for three seasons and a 
two-year starter, is a powerful runner who is also capable of big plays. 
Helping Silva break free is Traxler's job. SCHEDULE

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW; WILKINS, HAWKINS BATTLE FOR TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The night was oh so sweet for Bryan Wilkins and oh so bitter for Josh Hawkins. 
Two junior running backs destined for the Division I college ranks, battling 
for a Frontier League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Oct. 29, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins ran wild, gaining 188 of his 223 yards in the second half to pace 
Moorpark High's come-from-behind victory against two-time defending champion 
Nordhoff. Hawkins, who gained 162 of his 190 yards in the first half, watched 
helplessly as Wilkins stole his glory, running for three touchdowns in the 
second half to fuel Moorpark's 27-21 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "My offensive line was giving me holes and I was just bouncing outside," 
Hawkins said. "Ten more carries in the second half would have taken care of it. 
We would have won. We should have won." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Hawkins, who broke loose for two touchdowns -- including an 84-yard score 
-- in the first half to give Nordhoff a 14-0 lead, only carried four times in 
the second half because Nordhoff coaches opted to switch to a passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't rest until the rematch. It will come Nov. 4, when Moorpark visits 
Nordhoff. The circumstances figure to be identical. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be Nordhoff, league champions in 1991 and '92, aiming for revenge 
against the Musketeers, who won their first league title in 50 seasons and set 
a school record with nine victories in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins vs. Wilkins II should be quite a side show. The two could be battling 
for the area rushing title that night. Built almost identically, Hawkins (6 
feet 1, 185 pounds) and Wilkins (6-0, 185) rank second and fourth among area 
returning backs. Hawkins finished with 1,652 yards, averaging 9.0 yards a 
carry. Wilkins gained 1,402 and averaged 6.2 per carry, playing in one game 
less than Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins said he'll looking for revenge. He claims that Wilkins taunted the 
Rangers after he dove into the end zone on a four-yard sweep for the winning 
touchdown with three minutes 11 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started pumping his arms at us," said Hawkins, who was playing safety when 
Wilkins scored. "That (ticked) me off. He's a punk. When he comes to my side 
this year, I'm going to pop him." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who took off his helmet after the touchdown, ran to the Moorpark 
sideline and made a hook slide in front of a jubilant home crowd, claims he 
didn't gesture to his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't say anything the whole game," Wilkins said. "I know he doesn't like 
me and he wants to get me back. He keeps telling people, 'Where's Wilkins? I'm 
better than him.' I don't care what he says. It doesn't bother me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing personal against him. It's just competition against his team. 
He can take it personally if he wants to." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins remains frustrated about the defeat mainly because he was lost in the 
mix after he scored two touchdowns to give Nordhoff a 14-0 halftime lead. He 
finished the night with 15 carries, averaging 12.6 yard run, while Wilkins 
carried 31 times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches thought I had enough for the night, but I had plenty left," 
Hawkins said. "All the plays were passing. I didn't know what was going on, but 
I didn't want to say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark gave the ball to Wilkins 22 times in the second half, despite the 
fact the Ranger defense had held him to 35 yards in nine carries in the first 
half. Moorpark was hoping to wear down the Nordhoff defense by sending Wilkins 
repeatedly on sweeps to the short side of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had good linebackers," Wilkins said. "But our coaches felt if we kept 
hitting them, they'd get tired. We threw fresh fullbacks in there on them. The 
coaches figured the more I touched the ball, the more chances I would have to 
make something happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy worked. Hawkins said Ranger defensive linemen were "getting run 
over." Hawkins watched while Wilkins and Moorpark galloped to the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontier League coaches this year are giving Nordhoff the nod because the 
Rangers have 11 returning starters. Moorpark has five. 
</P>
<P>
 "We better win it," Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wilkins is not worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time that game comes around, we will have played a lot of games," he 
said. "It won't be a blowout. It'll be a battle like last year."

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW; CONTRERAS HAS RIO MESA READY TO TAKE WING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 George Contreras is a head coach again and for opponents in the Channel 
League, that can mean only one thing: 
</P>
<P>
 "Pass out the aspirin," Buena Coach Rick Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras was promoted this season from assistant to head coach at Rio Mesa 
after John Reardon retired. He has brought in his reliable old offense, the 
Delaware Wing T. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of our league better hold on to their fannies because they are going 
to see some stuff that they've never seen," said Scott, who coached at Newbury 
Park when Contreras was running the Wing T at Westlake in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wing T was designed at the University of Delaware specifically to help 
physically overmatched teams compete. The Wing T calls for four players in the 
backfield: a quarterback, a fullback, a a halfback and a wingback. 
</P>
<P>
 Wing T offenses begin with confusing shifts and players in motion. "It's the 
closest thing to Canadian football that American football has," Scott said. 
After the snap, there are a series of fakes and misdirections, so no one is 
quite sure who's got the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more counters off it than Carter's got liver pills," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras began researching the Wing T when he took over the program at 
Westlake. In 1978, the school's first year of varsity football, Contreras had 
no seniors and needed to find a way to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 He was intrigued when he heard about the innovative offense they were running 
in Delaware and a few other places around the country. One year, Marv Levy used 
the offense with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just so unusual," Contreras said. "We'd never seen anything like it, 
so we started researching it. Everything we heard about it said you don't need 
big players because everything is (based on) angles." 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras read books. He attended clinics. He watched films. He even flew to 
Delaware, where he learned he didn't quite understand the offense as well as he 
thought he did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was watching (Delaware) practice," he said, "and I went straight to a pay 
phone and called one of my assistants and said, 'When we get back, we are 
having a staff meeting, because we have been doing this totally (wrong).' There 
are so many nuances." 
</P>
<P>
 After 11 years of running the Wing T at Westlake, there are few nuances 
Contreras doesn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "George is the best at it," Scott said. "That's not just a pat on the back to 
one of my peers, but he is the guru. I've probably faced (the Wing T) 25-30 
times in the past 30 years, but no one runs it like him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "George truly knows if you take something away from him (defensively), you 
have to give something up. The only thing that can stop him is lack of talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, not even that. 
</P>
<P>
 "One year he had a tailback that was flat out slow," Scott said, "and he still 
gained 1,000 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras ran the offense so well at Westlake that the Warriors won three 
league titles. The Wing T even spread through the Marmonte League, with Royal 
and Channel Islands adopting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott predicts the same might happen in the Channel League. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other teams are going to run the stuff to prepare and they are going to see 
stuff that they like," he said. "And other teams are going to run the Delaware 
just because it works for Rio Mesa." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Wing T, Rio Mesa is expected to give its opponents headaches, but the 
Spartans may still not be able to overcome teams such as league favorites 
Ventura and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line," Contreras said, "is we are still going to be playing with a 
lot of sophomores and juniors with not a lot of varsity-level experience."

ADDING A NEW ROLE; ACTOR ROBERT GUILLAUME IS PUBLISHING HIS OWN BOOKS FOR 
CHILDREN THAT OFFER A POSITIVE REFLECTION OF MINORITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor Robert Guillaume never planned on playing the part of narrator of 
children's books. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did Guillaume -- best known as TV's "Benson" and for his well-received 
stint as Michael Crawford's replacement in the title role of the Los Angeles 
production of "Phantom of the Opera" -- ever envision himself as a publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 For all Guillaume's success on stage and screen, it was his search for reading 
material for his 5-year-old daughter that led him to diversify his roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Far too few children's stories, the actor concluded, offered a positive 
reflection of African Americans or other minorities. Moreover, minorities were 
especially lacking in the roles of heroes and heroines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Guillaume, the solution was simple. He would publish his own books. 
</P>
<P>
 From his Van Nuys production firm, the Confetti Company, Guillaume has 
released six learn-to-read books -- classic tales including "Little Red Riding 
Hood," "Sleeping Beauty" and "Hansel and Gretel" -- all with a multicultural 
approach and with Guillaume providing narration on accompanying audiocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
 The books, designed for children from age 3 to 8, feature illustrations of 
multiracial children in the roles of kings and queens, witches and woodsmen. 
The tapes also include the voices of children -- African Americans, Caucasians, 
Asians and Latinos -- reading dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more titles -- "Cinderella" and "A Christmas Carol" -- are scheduled for 
release soon. From there, Guillaume, who also has a 13-year-old daughter, plans 
to target older readers, beginning with preteens and then adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been thinking about this kind of problem with children's books for 10 
or 15 years," said Guillaume, who lives in Sherman Oaks. "I wanted to put out 
something that would have a significant effect. The titles are perennial, very 
popular, so they'll be coming up all the time, one generation after another." 
</P>
<P>
 Guillaume, a two-time Emmy winner, is far from the first celebrity to 
encourage children to read. Notable personalities including Shelley Duvall, 
Jonathan Winters and Jack Nicholson have lent their talents to similar 
endeavors, either on television or audiocassette. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of the thing to do right now," said Caron Chapman, executive 
director of the Assn. of Booksellers for Children in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is Guillaume a pioneer seeking to diversify the children's book market. 
Stories with multicultural flavor have steadily gained popularity in recent 
years -- including those that tinker with tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say that in the last three years, we've seen a proliferation of books 
like these," said Darlene Daniel, owner of Pages Books for Children and Young 
Adults in Tarzana. "We are seeing a variety of tellings of stories that are 
similar to the original but not the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Also available under the heading of multicultural works, Daniel noted, are 
original stories faithful to specific cultures and authored by people of that 
culture. Many of these stories have plots and themes similar to more popular 
children's titles but set in a different country. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, there are a multitude of variations of 'Cinderella' stories, 
each in a specific culture," Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters" (Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Books, 1987), an 
African story authored by African American John Steptoe, is one example. "Lon 
Po Po" (Philomel, 1989), written and illustrated by Asian American Ed Young, is 
a Chinese story similar to the tale of "Little Red Riding Hood." 
</P>
<P>
 Both books were recipients of Caldecott medals, awarded annually by the 
American Library Assn. to the most distinguished American picture book. Many 
similar books are available in more than 25 Southern California bookstores that 
offer a varying number of multicultural children's works, Chapman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing to remember about these folk tales is that they were written to be 
of that culture," Chapman said. "Really, every book should be about a different 
culture and be accurate about that culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman labeled adaptations with cultural modifications "fractured fairy 
tales," but still praised them because they very likely will encourage children 
to read. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two levels of meaning to the word 'multicultural,"' Chapman said. 
"One is, there are a collection of books about many different cultures. The 
second meaning is, there are stories with kids of many races or cultures 
together. Culture may not be an important part of the story, but they are all 
together and getting along and that's what's important." 
</P>
<P>
 Guillaume said his publications simply are "my own spin," designed to give a 
more accurate reflection of the American public. "And it is by no means a 
definitive answer to all the problems of the world. But it gives parents a tool 
to work with. I'm coming from a place that most African Americans share." 
</P>
<P>
 SH WHERE TO GO What: Fairy-tale books published by the Confetti Company, owned 
by Robert Guillaume. Titles: "The Frog Prince," "Little Red Riding Hood," 
"Sleeping Beauty," "Hansel and Gretel," "The Shoemaker and the Elves" and "A 
Different Kind of Christmas." Price: $9.95 each.

ADDING TO HUMOR'S SHELF LIFE; FRED RUBIN SAYS HIS WHIMSICAL BOXES STEM FROM HIS 
MAIN CONCERN, COMEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Steve Appleford is a regular 
contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Rubin still remembers his first time in the booth, watching with the 
producers as his first television script was brought to life. That was back in 
1977, for a long-forgotten half-hour comedy show called "Szysnyk," but Rubin 
can still recall his euphoria, and the laughs that followed his jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been getting a similar feeling lately, not just for the television 
writing he's done for some 18 years, but for his first art exhibit. And humor 
is still a big part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now hanging at Emerson's coffeehouse are 19 of Rubin's mixed-media collages, 
colorful boxes and compartments that gather a variety of found objects, from 
small toys to rescued trash. One oblong piece called "Comics Rule" is populated 
by comic book characters, and has already led to two commissions for Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
 "In television, everything you do is constantly being altered by other powers 
-- the actor, the director, the network, the studio," says Rubin. "An artwork 
is just yours. Nobody tells you to change that." 
</P>
<P>
 He's calling the exhibit "Between the Lines," referring to both the art-making 
he pursues between work writing comedy lines , and the rectangular compartments 
of each piece that he paints and populates with objects. Rubin has been making 
them since 1992 in the Valley Village home he shares with his wife, "Home 
Improvement" script consultant Marley Sims, and their 9-year-old son, Dale. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the works are made from pine boxes he purchases that already have 24 
small compartments. "I collect a lot of little objects that go in them," Rubin 
says. "When people see me at garage sales they just grin because they know I'm 
going to buy things that nobody else wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pride myself on using a lot of cast-off materials and recycled materials." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the appropriated objects in the show include an old paintbrush, a 
burnt-out flash cube, a used Polaroid canister and canceled stamps. For one 
work, sold before it could be included in the show, Rubin paid homage to the 
Northridge earthquake by creating a cracked stucco surface for the box, and 
then filling it with neighborhood rubble gathered from 15 different addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the works don't actually focus on such monumental subjects.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think these pieces reflect a sense of humor about them," says Rubin, who 
has worked as a writer-producer for such popular shows as "Archie Bunker's 
Place," "Night Court," "Mama's Family" and "Webster," writing more than 40 
half-hour episodes himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "People find this art not threatening. You can go to a lot of exhibits, and 
they're about death, or war, or anguish. These have a sense of fun about them. 
That comes from my main concern in life, which is comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 But his interest in creating art goes back to his youth in Chicago. "When I 
was a hippie I made candles and sold them. In college I took design classes. 
But I never amassed a body of work that I thought could sell. Every box you see 
here was in a room in my house, just sitting on the floor. People would visit 
the house and ask to buy one." 
</P>
<P>
 He sold six pieces that way, before finally deciding to try to put an exhibit 
together. The show landed at Emerson's, in large part because Rubin has become 
a regular there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," says Tarit Tanjasiri, owner of Emerson's, of Rubin's artwork. 
"It's different from the other artists that have been here, who have mostly 
shown oils and watercolors. And I've seen people react to it. He's done some 
things here that the kids have gone nuts over." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you work in Hollywood," Rubin says, "there is a certain pace, a certain 
aura, of business and money and work and prestige and celebrity. Doing this 
artwork takes me so far from that. And it's such an important rest." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been some crossover, however. For the new sitcom "On Our Own," to 
debut this month on ABC, the set-decorator has secured a couple of Rubin's 
boxes. "I was actually pretty thrilled by that," Rubin says, laughing, "because 
how many artists get to see their work seen by 30 million people?" WHERE AND 
WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: Mixed-media collages by Fred Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Emerson's, 13203 Ventura Blvd., Studio City.

 Hours: 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. Monday to Thursday, 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. Friday and

ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; MAN OF MANY TALENTS; HE'S KNOWN FOR HIS ZANY STYLE, BUT 
CHARLES NELSON REILLY'S CREDITS ARE IMPRESSIVE. HE DIRECTS 'THE WIVES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A new comedy, "The Wives," which opens next week at the Ventura Court Theatre 
in Studio City, is directed by television personality Charles Nelson Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly is probably best-known as a celebrity game-show contestant on programs 
such as "The Match Game" and "Hollywood Squares." His zany comic style makes it 
easy to forget that he also is an accomplished, award-winning actor and 
director.  
</P>
<P>
 Born in New York, Reilly studied acting with Uta Hagen. His early credits 
include featured roles in some of the biggest Broadway hits of the 1960s: "Bye 
Bye Birdie," "Hello Dolly" and "How to Succeed in Business Without Really 
Trying," for which he won a Tony Award. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, he conceived, produced and directed the Tony award-winning "The Belle 
of Amherst," starring Julie Harris, based on the life and writings of poet 
Emily Dickinson. The production garnered a fifth acting Tony for Harris and was 
later produced on PBS. Reilly also won an Emmy for his work on the "Ghost and 
Mrs. Muir," a 1960s television sitcom.  
</P>
<P>
 More recently, he has directed stage and television productions and teaches 
acting at his own school, The Faculty, in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wives" is an outgrowth of his workshop. All the performers are his 
students, and one of them, Rosie Taravella, wrote the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very good. It's turning into a love letter to Los Angeles," Reilly said. 
"Neil Simon's milked New York to death for years, so now we're doing this. 
Rosie's a wonderful writer, and we're having a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Taravella agreed that producing the two-act play has been fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an ensemble piece about five women who are not prepared to be friends," 
she said. "I wouldn't say it's inspirational, but it'll make you laugh and make 
you cry."  
</P>
<P>
 "The Wives" opens 8 p.m. Thursday at the Ventura Court Theatre, 12417 Ventura 
Court, Studio City. Performances will be 8 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays and 
7 p.m. Sundays. Closes Oct. 2. Tickets are $15; a percentage of the proceeds 
will benefit Haven Hills, a shelter for victims of domestic violence. Call 
(213) 660-TKTS.

<P>
 THE SHOW WON'T GO ON: Michael Fairman will tell you that he's seen kinder 
years than 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 First, his personal phone book was stolen. That's bad news for anyone, but 
when you're the artistic director of a theater group like the Actors' Company 
(which has previously produced "Town Meeting" and "XTV"), that's chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Second -- and just about the time Fairman managed to reconstruct his phone 
book -- his company had to vacate the Little Theatre, nestled in Burbank's 
George Izay Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Fairman said, "we were doing fine artistically. The critics loved 
'XTV,' 'Coriolanus,' and 'Spoon River Anthology.' But we were broke, both 
because we didn't have enough people coming to the plays, and not enough income 
to support our projects." 
</P>
<P>
 With an average per-production outlay of $3,000, expenses of more than $21,000 
for the past year, and a lease arrangement with the city of Burbank expiring in 
July, Fairman -- along with managing director M'Lisa MacLaren, company manager 
Mary Jo Kirwan and literary director Dennis Connor -- decided to vacate the 
98-seat, 42-year-old building. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had been buffeted by internal conflicts and members leaving for 
other pursuits, but Fairman insisted that it will continue as a producing 
entity, renting a theater space (not necessarily in the San Fernando Valley) 
when a production is ready. "We won't be a 50- to 60-member group, as we were," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 It also won't have one of the Valley's coziest theaters. As part of a deal 
struck with Burbank's Parks and Recreation Department, the Actors' Company had 
received what Fairman termed a "very generous" lease agreement with the city in 
exchange for the company's replacing decades-old sound and light systems with 
new equipment obtained with a city grant. "It will make this one of the 
best-equipped small theaters in L.A.," Fairman said.  
</P>
<P>
 MORE NOISE: A Noise Within, Glendale's classical theater company, has 
announced its 1994 fall program and dubbed it the "Season of Relative 
Encounters."  
</P>
<P>
 "We're really looking at families: families of blood and families of choice," 
said Julia Rodriguez Elliott, the company's executive director. "The obvious 
like in 'King Lear' and the not-so-obvious in 'School for Scandal.' Or 'Of Mice 
and Men,' which deals with creating your own family." 
</P>
<P>
 The company will present three classic plays in rotating repertory: 
Shakespeare's "King Lear" previews Oct. 5, opens Oct. 8, and closes Dec. 11; 
Richard Brinsley Sheridan's 18th-Century comedy of manners, "The School for 
Scandal," previews Oct. 19, opens Oct. 22 and closes Dec. 17, and John 
Steinbeck's modern classic "Of Mice and Men" previews Nov. 2, opens Nov. 5 and 
closes Dec. 18.

WRITING OF WRONGS; PLAYWRIGHT EXPLORES CRIME AND PUNISHMENT IN 18TH-CENTURY 
ENGLAND. THOUGH SOME THINGS CHANGE, HE FINDS MANY STAY THE SAME.

<P>
 You might think from the sound of it that "petty treason" would be a petty 
offense, with an equally lenient punishment. Not so in 18th-Cen tury England, 
where the sentence for the crime -- usually attached to women who killed their 
husbands -- was being burned at the stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, "high treason" was worse. For that offense against the Crown, 
wrongdoers were decapitated, then drawn and quartered. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruminations on crime and punishment, guilt and innocence, morality, brutality 
and humanity are at the core of Jon Bastian's "Petty Treasons," a 
seven-character drama that has its world premiere at the Road Theatre Company, 
beginning previews Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was reading Colin Wilson's 'Mammoth Book of True Crime,' looking for 
ideas," says Bastian, 32, whose Civil War-era "Noah Johnson Had a Whore . . ." 
won South Coast Repertory's 1991 California Playwrights Competition. "Crime is 
such a great field for drama." His attention was drawn to the case of Catherine 
Hayes, who was living with her husband and two lovers when the husband was 
murdered, his head left on the banks of the Thames. The trio were subsequently 
arrested and convicted of murder; the men were hanged, and Hayes was burned at 
the stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I wrote my first draft 3 1/2 years ago, the story went from A to Z 
chronologically -- and it didn't work," says Bastian, a Woodland Hills native. 
"It was 'Act 1: They did it; Act 2: They got caught.' There was no surprise. In 
my third draft, I restructured the piece, told it from the point of view of the 
hangman -- who'd been a minor character in the earlier version -- telling the 
story 50 years later. So what we see is like a kaleidoscope: time flowing 
through itself. The style is more emotional than temporal." 
</P>
<P>
 That element was particularly intriguing to director Brad Hills. "We were just 
coming off of 'Pirates,' which had a similar thing of two different time 
periods," Hills says. "But this takes it a step further. Characters from a 
later period show up in a scene during the earlier period and even manipulate 
the characters. In 1777, the executioner Jack Frye is an old man, speaking to 
the nature of justice -- and flashing back on these actual events. Yet you 
never really get the whole truth; you're free to make your own judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 That is because, Bastian notes, although the trio confessed to the murder, 
"it's not real clear that they did it. There was probably torture involved. But 
even beyond their guilt, you're dealing with: 'Was what they did any different 
from what was done to them? What's different (about killing) when the king 
commands it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bastian likewise sees parallels to the O. J. Simpson case. "We may never know 
the truth," he points out. "There are already so many versions of the story, 
questions if the verdict will be 'right.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bastian was a communications major at Loyola Marymount's film school when the 
theater bug bit. "I was acting, directing, painting sets, playing in the 
orchestra for the musicals," he says. He's now a nine-year member of Golden 
West Playwrights, based at the Road Theatre. Bastian was recently one of 10 
screenwriters (out of 3,500 applicants) chosen to participate in the 
Chesterfield Writers Film Project, an annual program sponsored by Steven 
Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the topicality of "Treasons," Bastian says: "At the time of this 
case, London was having serious problems with poverty, crime and gangs. People 
used to enjoy public executions; the trials were covered by their version of 
today's tabloids. That's what I like about historical drama: finding the human 
things that never change." WHERE AND WHEN

THEATER REVIEW; TWO ACTS, ONE JOKE; 'MARRIEDS' HONEYMOON COMEDY HAS SOME FUNNY 
MOMENTS, BUT NOT ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The naughty wedding night comedy "For Marrieds Only" at the NoHo Studios in 
North Hollywood is a tacky, one-joke play about a 1930s bride who insists on 
following a sex manual to the minutest detail before venturing into bed with 
her frustrated groom. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally staged in Texas and brought here by the Texas Premiere Theatre, the 
production should appeal to people who drape topless hula dancer dolls from 
their rearview mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 After two acts of the prim and proper bride earnestly instructing her by-now 
crazed husband in "how to accomplish sex in the absolutely correct manner," you 
are definitely ready to swear off theater forever. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that the tone of the play is sleazy or salacious. J. Tom 
Graham, who was inspired to write the play when he discovered just such a 
marriage manual heirloom in a family trunk, is never less than playful in mood 
and, on occasion, even funny. But not nearly often enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The bride's anxious mother (Dace Broc) cautions her daughter (Jocelyn Benford) 
that she may scare off her husband (John Minton, who doubles as the director) 
and forever be a virgin if she doesn't manage to get down to business.  
</P>
<P>
 The couple happens to be honeymooning in the parents' guest bedroom -- 
remember, this is the Depression -- and the mother explains to the bride that 
sex is "for men and anniversaries and birthdays or when your husband comes home 
drunk." She describes her own honeymoon sex as the "the worst 10 minutes of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 All of this sounds more promising than it plays. The text satirizes, 
accurately enough, how dramatically sexual mores have changed in just one 
couple's lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the audience-friendly performances of Benford and Minton as the 
young harried marrieds, the play is like a shaggy dog story -- far more 
lightweight and tattered than beguiling or engaging. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: "For Marrieds Only." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: NoHo Studios, 5215 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 4 p.m. Sundays. Ends Sept. 18.

COMEDY THAT'S NOT OVER THE HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA L. OLIANDE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 L.A. Cabaret is a small comedy club in Encino that features headliners on 
Fridays and Saturdays and variety shows, bands and open-mike entertainment 
other nights. The comedians are diverse in attitude and acts, and the decor 
gives it an old-time feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: It's an intimate, comfortable place to enjoy good comedy in a 
Hollywood-type atmosphere, without having to go over the hill. There is a small 
lounge with a bar to the left of the main entrance, with a one-person stage and 
piano. Inside the main room there are tables and a large stage. A full menu is 
served in both rooms with the entrees priced at $6 for chicken and $10 for 
steak. Drinks are good and strong, but pricey ($4 for a beer; $4 to $5.50 for 
mixed drinks), and there is a two-drink minimum with admission. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: The age varies, from a group of college freshmen to a few 
middle-age couples. The rule is 16 and older and the average is mid-20s. Dress 
is casual, mostly jeans but also shorts and some long skirts. Audience members 
who weren't part of a couple got singled out and joked about by almost every 
comic to hit the stage. A group of six women and a table of two men were teased 
ad nauseam. 
</P>
<P>
 THE LAUGHS: On a recent Friday night, most of the headliners were men. A lone 
women performed at the 11:30 p.m. show, but before her, it was all guys. "My 
scuba diving instructor told me, 'Don't bother the sharks and they won't bother 
you,' " said comic Nick Arandes. "But, how do I know the shark isn't saying, 
'Hey, that guy's looking at my girlfriend.' " Several of the comedians agreed 
that the Cabaret is no different than performing at other comedy clubs across 
the country. One man said it may even be a little more difficult to please an 
audience here. "With Valley audiences, you really have to perform," said Mel 
Kohl, emcee for the early show. "You really have to be a performer, a showman." 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: The club had a good roster of comics that night, performing improv, 
stand-up and impressions. Although the crowd was small, some performers used it 
to their advantage. And at least one woman was glad that there weren't a lot of 
people: "I like it when it's not crowded," said April Sneed, 23, of West Hills. 
"It gets uncomfortable when it's too crowded." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: With so few people to laugh, some comics turned to heckling audience 
members when their jokes fell flat and the silence was too much. Although some 
audience wags urged them on, for others, it was an uncomfortable moment.  
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: "Who came up with the name softball?" asked Arandes. "I got hit with 
one of those things and they're not soft. Why don't they call it what it is: 
bigger ball?" 
</P>
<P>
 "This is California. Is it mandatory in this state that I have to do an O.J. 
joke?" asked one comic. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Cabaret, 17271 Ventura Blvd., Encino. Shows at 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m. 
Fridays and Saturdays; 7:30 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays. Club opens at 6 
p.m. nightly. Cover $6 weeknights, $9 weekends, with a two-drink minimum. (818) 
501-3737.

COVER STORY; AT WHAT PRICE FUN?; DESPITE RISING COSTS, PEOPLE FIND WAYS TO 
PURSUE THEIR FAVORITE AMUSEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in 1974, a typical family of four, the Hendersons in Sunland or the 
Garcias living in Reseda, could enjoy a barrel of good times -- swimming at a 
public pool, dinner at McDonald's, an evening concert at the Universal 
Amphitheatre -- for less than $40. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, these outings would total almost $160. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take professional sports as an example -- ticket prices have skyrocketed to 
the point where people have to pay $50 to watch a game," said Roy Adler, a 
marketing professor at Pepperdine University. "Where are these folks going 
now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some have been driven away from their favorite pastimes by price hikes that, 
in many cases, have outpaced the average family income and the Consumer Price 
Index. But the majority of consumers, experts suggest, have adapted. They have 
scrimped and saved and cut back in other areas to maintain a semblance of their 
leisure habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Perlen Harris of West Hills now takes her family to bargain matinees. Tom 
Wilson has sworn off movies altogether, preferring to spend his dollars on 
Grateful Dead concerts, where ticket prices have risen from $12 to $35. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends on how dedicated you are," explained Wilson, an 18-year-old 
Topanga Canyon resident. "I could say, 'No, this is too expensive.' But I enjoy 
it so much that I'm willing to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial entertainment -- be it concerts, movies or ice skating -- always 
has been the domain of the middle class, said George Welton, a professor of 
leisure studies and recreation at Cal State Northridge. In the realm of tract 
homes and strip shopping malls, people take such fun seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "These activities are an essential part of life," Welton said. "It just shows 
how important they are to people that they would forgo other things to keep 
doing them." 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence of this, the professor points out that expensive football and 
baseball games continue to draw large crowds. Golf courses remain crowded. The 
film industry boasts record box-office sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Further evidence comes from the U.S. Department of Commerce. According to 
federal records, Americans increased their spending on personal consumption by 
45% from 1986 to 1992. At the same time, their expenditures for recreation 
increased by 56%. In other words, the cost of good times outraced other types 
of personal expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 So what kinds of sacrifices are consumers making in these tough times? At the 
Balboa and Encino municipal golf courses, players talk of cutting back from 
three rounds to two rounds a week. Like Harris at the General Cinema in 
Fallbrook Mall, moviegoers have confined themselves to early shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Movies are often singled out for criticism by disgruntled consumers. But 
theater owners have actually lagged in terms of price increases. While movie 
tickets have risen approximately 150% in the last 20 years, the prices of other 
forms of entertainment have tripled and even quintupled. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of concert tickets became a point of contention this summer when the 
rock group Pearl Jam canceled plans for a national tour after unsuccessfully 
seeking a practical way to keep ticket prices under $20. 
</P>
<P>
 The band also filed an antitrust complaint with the Justice Department, 
alleging that Ticketmaster is violating federal law by controlling ticket 
prices and blocking new entrants into the distribution business. The Los 
Angeles-based company adds fees of between $4 and $8 to the price of tickets 
ordered through its telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster argued before a House panel that its fees are competitive and 
constitute a small fraction of the overall amount that fans spend on tickets. 
Other entertainment purveyors have similarly justified price increases. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Universal Studios Tour, tickets have risen from $4.95 in 1974 to $31. 
But officials are quick to say that 20 years ago their attraction comprised 
only a couple of stunt shows and a 45-minute tram ride through the back lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it takes nine hours to see everything," said Joan Bullard, a spokeswoman 
for the theme park. "You have special effects and rides. You have all kinds of 
food and shops. You don't even have to go on the tram." 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus Speedway, on the other hand, has changed surprisingly little since the 
grandstands were built in 1924 for what was originally a rodeo arena owned by 
Hoot Gibson. Since 1974, the track has raised its prices only $2. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sports Center Bowl in Studio City, general manager Tom Cristi has 
similarly avoided costly additions that might boost prices. Cristi said he 
keeps the economic crunch in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to go to the grocery store, you've got to buy gas and go to the 
doctor. You don't have to go bowling," the general manager said. "Still, people 
want to do something. A family of four can go bowling on a Saturday night for 
$35. They go to a Dodger game and it's $75." 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of such savings, Amir Kazemzadeh of West Hills brought his cousins -- 
Hassan, 12; Arash, 10, and Amir, 6 -- to the bowling alley because it 
represented an inexpensive way to keep them occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go to school and I'm on a budget," said Kazemzadeh, who chooses an 
alternative to paying by the game. "It's cheaper if you get a lane by the 
hour." 
</P>
<P>
 It is even cheaper to stay home. Commerce Department figures suggest that a 
good number of people have found a low-cost substitute to fill some of their 
leisure hours. Of all the money spent on recreation in 1992, the largest amount 
poured into a statistical category that did not even exist until 1988. That 
category includes video rentals, home computers and other types of home 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans spent $58.8 billion for such goodies in 1992. By comparison, they 
spent only $5 billion to go to the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play at home," a West Hills man explained. "Computer hacking, that sort of 
thing. Everything else is too damn expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 But the belief persists that people will continue with their favorite pursuits 
no matter what the cost. Just ask Chuck Wiley of Chatsworth, a regular at 
Balboa Municipal Golf Course where the green fees have more than quadrupled to 
$20.50 over the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose golf could price itself out of existence," Wiley said. "But there 
are people who are addicted to the point that they would pay almost anything to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And of all the millions of people who live in Los Angeles, it takes only 6,200 
to fill the Universal Amphitheatre for a rock concert. Consumer experts say 
there will always be loyal fans willing to bear the increased cost of tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've always seemed expensive to me," mused a Ticketmaster operator. 
</P>
<P>
 As for slight changes that consumers are forced to make, some may be for the 
good, Adler suggests. The marketing professor suspects that harsh economic 
reality has persuaded families to give the simpler pleasures a try, forgotten 
activities such as picnics or even conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this has improved our quality of life because more people are finding 
out that there are low-priced options, good times can be had on the cheap," he 
said. "You don't have to go out for movies, you can enjoy your family more." 
What We Paid Then and Now 
</P>
<P>
 1974: Richard M. Nixon resigned from the presidency and Muhammad Ali returned 
as the heavyweight champion of the world. The American public was introduced to 
gas lines, "Jaws" and streaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more noteworthy, it was a year when you could play a round of golf for 
less than $5. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a sample of the price of entertainment and recreation over the last two 
decades. 05,41,10,10,09,10 1974 1984 1994 % change Saugus Speedway $6 $7 $8 33%

 When a new season is around the corner, what a pleasant feeling it is to have 
some dazzling out fit, new and just waiting for the first cool and appropriate 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 When I stopped to research the new location of Wilson's Outlet store, my son 
spotted a silky suede bomber jacket in an elegant shade of coral. The price tag 
read $49.95, and he crowed, "Hey, I saw this somewhere for $200!" He hasn't 
been into this bargain shopping very much, but became a believer instantly. Now 
that splendid suede is waiting in his closet for the first nippy day of fall. 
</P>
<P>
 This new Wilson's store in Burbank is located in what was a Security Pacific 
bank and just around the corner from its previous location. A sign in the 
window screams, "Nothing over $99.99," which foretells of the bargains, if 
you've priced leather apparel lately. 
</P>
<P>
 As you enter, on the left you'll see the women's department and will learn 
just how drastic the price cuts are. Some brightly colored and very supple 
leather halter tops that were $69.95 are tagged at $19.95 with skirts to match 
for $29.99 (originally $119.99). So an outfit that was close to $200 can be 
purchased for $50. Suede shorts in a multitude of colors are $9.99, one-third 
of the original price. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the inventory at this sole outlet store is made up of close-outs from 
the 500-plus stores of the Wilson's chain across the country. It might be 
merchandise from last season or overruns from the current season, or perhaps 
some broken sizes from the current line. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, however, some racks for damaged goods on the right and in the 
middle of the men's department, and it's these that the seasoned shoppers, 
looking for a treasure, check out on a regular basis. They might find a $400 
leather coat for $50 because of a small rip -- it has happened. Some men's 
leather pants that originally were selling for $149 were slashed to $29.99 
because of a scratch, and a man's handsome black leather car coat that was $325 
is now $99.99, due to a one-inch rip that could easily be covered with a 
colorful patch of some sort. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bins toward the center of the store are accessories -- a few scattered 
handbags, gloves and attache cases -- all drastically reduced and always worth 
checking. I still wish I had picked up the $245 attache case for $39.99, and by 
not doing so broke one of the cardinal rules for bargain shoppers. Don't 
procrastinate -- pounce!

GETAWAYS; ROW YOUR BOAT; PARTICIPANTS CAN EMBARK ON A MOONLIGHT JOURNEY OR 
PADDLE AROUND AN ISLAND.

 Like any sport that requires a piece of equipment that floats, kayaking 
presents novices with an overwhelming dread: how to get in and out of the darn 
thing without looking like Rush Limbaugh vaulting into an inner tube.  
</P>
<P>
 For Brad Bjornson, the ordeal was compounded by recent reconstructive knee 
surgery that left him hobbling on crutches. Still, Bjornson was determined to 
try kayaking, a sport he discovered through Malibu Ocean Sports, which offers 
kayak treks in Marina del Rey, Malibu and the Channel Islands. Bjornson 
recently joined the group's two-hour moonlight paddle around the marina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play a lot of tennis and like to bike and run, so I've been going nuts 
sitting around watching TV for two months," said Bjornson, 40, a marina 
resident who signed up for the trek through the Learning Annex. "I didn't need 
to use my legs at all in the kayak, so I really enjoyed the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kayaking is great by moonlight. First you see the sunset, and then the 
marina's lights come out, and you can see stars and the glimmer of the city 
when you get to the breakwater. The paddles have light sticks on them, so when 
it gets dark, all you see are ghostly lights moving in circles." 
</P>
<P>
 Bjornson used an open-deck kayak, a self-baling boat that's less tippy than 
closed boats. The new boats are designed so that "almost everyone can hop in 
and go," said Sean Caples, owner of Malibu Ocean Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 On the moonlight paddle, Caples takes participants through various marina 
channels, pointing out celebrities' yachts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We start out every group with a quick lesson in how to hop in and out, and 
how to stabilize the boat if it tips over, which it rarely does. Our ocean 
trips require a bit more mastery. People who are a little timid usually try the 
moonlight paddle first." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after his marina tour, Bjornson sank his timidity and joined Caples 
and 15 others on a kayak tour of Santa Cruz Island in the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my first week off crutches," said Bjornson, limping down to the 
shore, paddle in hand, "so I'm ready for something more drastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Bjornson spent the next three hours navigating golden kelp beds, peering 
through crystal water and gliding through the island's caves. Some kayakers 
brought snorkel equipment, easily jumping in and out of their boats for a 
glimpse of underwater life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor seals occasionally poked their heads above the surf, peering at the 
neon-colored plastic boats that resembled huge plastic toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Caples gave ample instruction on how to paddle, demonstrating a figure-eight 
motion and a brisk backstroke that sharply turned his kayak. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be coordinated to do this," said Suzie Matthews, who added that 
some novice paddlers initially find the strokes awkward. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I got in that boat, I thought I was in heaven," said Matthews, a 
nurse from Sherman Oaks. "I feel very independent when I'm in the kayak. It 
feels like I can go exploring anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the experience for those in single boats, said several kayakers on 
the one-day trip. For others, the prospect of a two-seater posed additional 
challenges -- such as deciding who should steer, who should take orders and 
just how close the fragile-looking boats should get to looming, 
barnacle-covered rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Caples said most novices who initially try the double boats yearn for time 
alone in a one-seater. "It's really a loner sport," said Caples, who has been 
leading tours for 10 years. "And it's very meditative." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, after two hours of kayaking through a Windex-blue ocean, arms slicing 
hundreds of perfect figure-eight circles through the salt air, kayakers said 
they forgot their trip had a final destination. That really didn't matter 
anymore, they said. They simply existed. And that seemed reason enough. WHERE 
AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: Ocean and marina kayaking offered by Learning Annex through Malibu Ocean 
Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Malibu Ocean Sports, on the public beach at the corner of Via Marina 
and Panay Way, Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Moonlight paddles are 7 to 11 p.m. Sept. 22 and Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $34. Participants gather for dinner and drinks afterward at nearby 
Pierview Cafe. Dinner is half-price ($8 to $15) for kayakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Ocean kayaking from 9 a.m. to noon Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $49. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Treks: Call Malibu Ocean Sports for information on one- or two-day treks 
to the Channel Islands. The shop also rents kayaks, offers kayak parties for 10 
or more and gives lessons in windsurfing, jet skiing and surfing.

VALLEY VOGUE; WAVING A WHITE FLAG; FASHION POLICE CALL A TRUCE AS MORE WOMEN 
BREAK A CARDINAL RULE ABOUT POST-LABOR DAY SHOES.; WHETHER IT BE WHITE PATENT

AS ISAAC MIZRAHI, CHANEL AND GUCCI.

 This September, fashion plates across America are donning dressy white pumps, 
quashing the long-held fashion rule that it's considered the height of 
tackiness to wear white shoes after Labor Day. One Valley Vogue spy in the Big 
Apple reports that the Harper's Bazaar editors are running around in white 
pumps, while their counterparts at Vogue have taken to Barbie doll-style white 
mules.  
</P>
<P>
 "White is certainly one of the hottest trends around for fall," says Eileen 
Walker, a shoe buyer who reports that it is one of the top four biggest sellers 
at I. Magnin stores, including the Promenade Mall location. Whether it be white 
patent leather or smooth kid, the au courant white shoe is being offered by 
such names as Isaac Mizrahi, Chanel and Gucci, and it's the perfect 
accompaniment to the equally trendy white A-line dress being offered by Calvin 
Klein and other designers this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 For some stores, white is not only a trend, it's a way of doing business 
long-term. Take the White House in the Glendale Galleria, where merchandise 
year-round is, naturally, predominantly white. Manager Diana Marshall, fully 
aware of the white-hot trend, says she was amused to see how many stores in the 
mall featured all-white merchandise in their display windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the store offers a variety of cream and off-white items, Marshall says 
the current bestsellers are the matching sportswear tops and bottoms -- in 
white. 
</P>
<P>
 TATTOO YOU: San Fernando Valley tattoo artists are warning teen-agers about 
the danger of the new luminescent pigment tattoos. These tattoos are invisible 
in regular light but glow vividly in the ultraviolet light of nightclubs and 
other subterranean digs. They are all the rage in San Francisco, but haven't 
reached the same popularity here. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids who want to conceal the tattoo from their parents are particularly 
tempted to sport them. 
</P>
<P>
 But "the inks used have not been tested. We're not sure if they are safe or 
even durable," says Bonnie Parker, a tattoo artist at World Famous Emporium of 
Tattoos in Van Nuys, which has no plans to offer the luminescent pigments. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there seems to be a resurgence of temporary tattooing among San 
Fernando Valley youth. Gurmeet Sawhney, manager at Aahs in Sherman Oaks, says 
the store almost discontinued the temporary tattoos because of slow sales 
earlier this year. But in the last month, among teen-age and adult customers, 
sales of the hearts, skulls and Harley-Davidson styles have picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 At prices ranging from $2.99 to $6, not only are the temp tattoos more 
affordable than real ones, they involve far less commitment on the part of the 
people who wear them. And when it comes to trends, the ability to walk away 
sometimes means everything. Just ask Johnny Depp, whose "Winona Forever" tattoo 
has undoubtedly outlived its truth and its beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 LITTLE-KNOWN CLAWS: Will Dragon Lady nails make a comeback? They're on the 
cusp of a revival. Longer, more dramatic lengths -- as much as three-quarters 
of an inch -- are being touted by nail product manufacturers and manicurists as 
the ideal complement to the equally outrageous faux fur, rubber and plastic 
fall fashions. 
</P>
<P>
 "No excess is too much," explains Susan Weiss-Fishmann, executive vice 
president/artistic director of OPI, a professional nail-product manufacturer in 
North Hollywood. As for professional women who usually feel that a longer nail 
would be out of place in their business environment, Weiss-Fishmann advises 
them to adopt a squared-off shape, making a slightly longer nail more 
practical.  
</P>
<P>
 Trends aside, many Valley manicurists maintain that most working women still 
shun the "Flo Jo" look, opting instead for nails that extend just beyond the 
nail bed by about an eighth of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The younger girls always like the longer nails, but for women who type and 
work, it just isn't very practical," says Wanda Bernal, owner of The Nail 
Cottage in Granada Hills. It's that kind of thinking -- beauty before comfort 
-- that will keep the rubber dress crowd in claws for the next few months.

FOR KIDS; STUDENTS GO WILD; WITH CRAFTS, CABINS AND CAMPFIRES, CLEAR CREEK 
EDUCATION CENTER GIVES L.A. SCHOOLCHILDREN A WEEK OF HANDS-ON LEARNING ABOUT 
THE VALUE OF NATURE.

 Ask Sandy Vasquez, 11, what she did during a recent school week, and she'll 
talk about hiking mountain trails, making rope from yucca plants, listening to 
coyotes howl, practicing Native American survival skills, singing around a 
campfire and bunking down in a cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy, a sixth-grader at Ranchito Elementary School in Panorama City, wasn't 
playing hooky. For one glorious week, her studies were held at the Clear Creek 
Outdoor Education Center, operated in the Angeles National Forest by the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Every week throughout the year, 80 fifth- and sixth-graders (20 girls and 20 
boys from each of two schools) spend Monday to Friday getting a hands-on 
science education in the wilderness area above La Canada, and about 60 middle 
and senior high school students attend on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Clear Creek is shared by the more than 500 public schools in the Los 
Angeles district, each school may send students to the site only once every 
three to five years, and just a tiny percentage of the system's almost 600,000 
pupils have the chance to take part. Still, since the field studies program was 
initiated in 1925, more than 300,000 students have participated.  
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of these kids, it is the first time they have ever been on a hike, 
their first time in the mountains, their first time in a cabin, the first time 
they ever slept away from home," said Mark Gardina, Clear Creek's resident 
assistant manager, who is known as "Bear" to students. "We take them away from 
loud noises and cars, and let them hear owls, crickets and coyotes. They are 
excited the whole time they are here. They are interested in everything; they 
touch everything; they explore. The idea is hands-on, experiential learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Clear Creek is in the middle of a stand of pine trees planted about 70 years 
ago by the teachers and students who established the outdoor program. The 
compound consists of sleeping cabins, lodge, dining room, swimming pool, arts 
and crafts area, playground, weather station and observatory.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a fabulous telescope that gives our students a better view of the 
night sky than they would get at Griffith Park, because we are so far from city 
lights," said Debra Hetrick, coordinator of the district's Outdoor Education 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
 A caged menagerie of native wildlife, including a bobcat, hawk, owl, eagle and 
snakes -- which had been injured and rehabilitated but cannot survive in the 
wild -- live at a nature study center on the premises.  
</P>
<P>
 Though Clear Creek's cabins, crafts and campfires are decidedly camplike, the 
program is first and foremost a school. "The emphasis is on education," Hetrick 
said, "but the classroom is outdoors. Students learn about environmental 
responsibility, different kinds of ecosystems and the balance of nature." 
</P>
<P>
 "We teach them to appreciate nature," Gardina added. "When the students 
arrive, a lot of them want to hurt the animals. If they see a lizard, their 
first instinct is to grab a rock and stone it to death. But by the end of the 
week, those same kids are likely to respect insects and animals. A camp is a 
great place to teach."  
</P>
<P>
 Four resident naturalists lead a variety of science-based activities, which 
cover all educational disciplines, from art to astronomy, composition to 
conservation, geology to geography, mathematics to music. Youngsters examine -- 
then carefully release -- insects and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 They compare the chaparral growing along a hot dry trail with the lush ferns 
near a waterfall. They try to figure out the age of a favorite tree. They write 
letters to parents and keep journals. They practice recycling and learn to 
compost. They create crafts from natural finds collected from the forest floor. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Students can more easily grasp abstract concepts, such as the cycles of 
nature, photosynthesis or the food chain, when they have an opportunity to 
actually see them, rather than reading about them in a textbook," naturalist 
Judi Sturkie said. "They learn without even knowing they are learning." 
</P>
<P>
 April Torres, 11, was invited to inspect "all the little things in the water" 
while she hiked along a creek. "I think they were newts," the Ranchito 
sixth-grader said. "We saw a snake too and walked around it. At night, we 
looked through a telescope and saw a planet. I think it was Jupiter. It looked 
like a little round circle." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of their learning flows from activities and games," added Ranchito 
teacher Marla Pena, who accompanied the students on the field trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, when we went hiking, the kids wanted to push the dirt with their 
feet. That led to a discussion about erosion. At night, we sat around a 
campfire and learned Indian legends. Then the students performed a skit, with 
each student playing a role as a different part of a tree. The students also 
set the tables; they cleaned up; they took care of themselves. They learned to 
interact with each other, to cooperate and to be responsible."

RESTAURANT REVIEW; ENTICING BLEND OF FLAVORS; AT JIN HUNG WON, CHINESE DISHES 
PAIR WITH KOREAN INFLUENCES TO PRODUCE PUNGENT, SOMETIMES FIERY, RESULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Part of food's magic is the way a transplanted cuisine changes to suit local 
tastes. Chinese cuisine is the most chameleonic of all, as will be noted by 
anyone visiting the very good Jin Hung Won in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese emigrants have evolved distinctive cooking styles in each country 
they've moved to. As a result, the Chinese of Vietnam cook quite differently 
than their counterparts in Japan. Very little a Bangkok Chinese family eats 
looks like anything you'd see on a Chinese table in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 At Jin Hung Won, the kitchen is influenced by Korea, which happens to be my 
favorite non-Chinese-speaking country for a good Chinese meal. I've never had a 
bad dinner in a Korean-Chinese restaurant, and I don't put that down to chance. 
Korean Chinese clearly have a distinctive style, at once tasteful and forceful; 
they use oil sparingly, apply chiles with gusto and favor clean, unmuddled 
flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 From a short distance, you may not even realize that Jin Hung Won is a Chinese 
restaurant. It's located in a Korean strip mall, a long, slightly 
neglected-looking development where all the storefronts are emblazoned with 
signs in the blocky (and, once you get to know it, logical) Korean script. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the restaurant is a large, well-scrubbed, almost sterile-looking series 
of dining rooms, the only real decoration being a Renoir print on one wall and 
a large Chinese screen hidden in a corner. The language you hear being spoken 
is Korean; clientele is largely Korean Americans, who come to order the special 
cold noodle dishes (posted on the wall, also in Korean script) and enjoy the 
home-style Chinese dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin a meal here with a plateful of light, ethereal suei chow , literally 
"water dumplings." These steamed dumplings, which come eight to the order, 
feature an airy filling of lean pork and chopped green vegetables sealed in a 
light, chewy noodle skin. Enjoy them with kimchi, the spicy, partially 
fermented cabbage that appears at every Korean meal. Kimchi automatically comes 
with everything here, no matter what you order, but in practice you might have 
to ask for it if you do not look Korean. ("I thought Americans didn't like 
pickles," apologized our waitress.) 
</P>
<P>
 Noodles are terrific here too, especially the ones posted on the wall. Ask for 
cha jiang min , which are sticky wheat noodles in a mysterious-looking brown 
sauce. The sauce is really no mystery -- it's full of dried tofu, minced bamboo 
and chopped mushrooms. Champon is a huge bowl of ramen-type noodles, fish 
cakes, shredded pork and vegetables. The soup is flavorful on its own, but if 
you are daring enough, you might want to add a spoonful of the fiery house 
chile sauce, which turns it into a special treat. (I repeat: if you're daring 
enough.) 
</P>
<P>
 The richest section of this menu may be the poultry dishes. Spicy crispy 
chicken might share the name of a sandwich served at Jack In The Box, but any 
resemblance ends there. This chicken has crackling skin and tender, juicy meat 
that falls off the bone -- and it's bright red from having been dipped in a hot 
chile sauce. For $9.95 you get half a Chungking-style duck, which is basically 
Peking duck without the trimmings. Fried chicken with hot sauce is like 
something you might find in Texas, a batter-fried bird dipped in more of that 
same killer hot sauce. There is even a dish called stewed chicken with cayenne 
pepper, but the wrinkle in the nose of the waitress convinced me it was going 
to be too hot for our group. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard Chinese restaurant dishes are not ignored, and quite a few of them 
are far more tasty than their cliche names might suggest. Shrimp with green 
peas, for example, is a dish you might pass right by unless you knew the shrimp 
were squeaky-fresh, the peas green and crisp and the sauce lightened by billowy 
clumps of egg white. Pan-fried fresh scallops are nicely browned and 
straightforward in flavor, and vegetable favorites such as black mushroom with 
bamboo shoot are aromatic and crunchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Adventurous palates can take on oddly textured delicacies like sea cucumber 
with braised pork, while those who like rustic Chinese food will be pleased by 
a dish such as stewed meatballs -- half a dozen fine, fatty pork meatballs with 
heavily browned crusts. I never eat here without having this dish. The 
meatballs come in brown sauce with cabbage and bok choy, making a perfect 
supper with a mound of fluffy white rice. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, the back page of the menu is full of Korean dishes. I suppose 
somebody must order them, but I've never seen them on anybody's table. Just for 
the record, they're typical Korean fare such as barbecued short ribs, broiled 
mackerel, farmhouse-type dishes like bin dae ttok (a griddled mung bean 
omelet/pancake) and a variety of spicy soups.

 Pro football '94, from Bay to Zzzzzz. . . 
</P>
<P>
 1. San Francisco. Old Pro Bowl veterans never die, they just play out their 
options and sign with San Francisco. Ken Norton, Richard Dent, Rickey Jackson, 
Bart Oates and Gary Plummer have all piled on board in recent months, proving 
two things: (a) Steve Young won't have that "He's No Mr. January" thing to 
worry about much longer; and (b) this new NFL salary cap apparently comes in 
adjustable sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Dallas. We interrupt this dissertation on why the Cowboys can't win the 
Super Bowl with Barry Switzer for a few words from new Cowboy and former Ram 
offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese, who is miked and on the practice field 
right now. Ernie? "YEEEEE HAW! HOOOOEEE! Try that again, Troy! For the folks 
back in Orange County. That's right. Look at this, look at this! He's back in 
the pocket! He doesn't fall down! HE DOESN'T FALL DOWN! Now watch this. He 
throws! A PERFECT SPIRAL! Over Michael Irvin's right shoulder! Not 15 yards 
behind him! Not into the Powerade cooler! RIGHT ON THE MONEY! And he catches 
it! HE CATCHES IT! Omigod, omigod. (Zampese begins to sob.) Bless you, Jerry 
Jones. Bless you, sir, ble . . . "(Audio feed goes dead as microphone shorts 
out.) 
</P>
<P>
 3. Raiders. Where it's Throwback Week every week as the Raiders bring back 
their playbook from 1969, personally autographed by Daryle (Mad Bomber) 
Lamonica. Page 1: Quarterback throws deep down the right sideline. Page 2: 
Quarterback throws deep down the left sideline. Page 3: Quarterback throws deep 
over the middle. Page 4: PAT formation. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Denver. John Elway passed for 4,000 yards last season, and now he has three 
new amigos -- Anthony Miller, Mike Pritchard and Leonard Russell. Final score, 
1994 AFC Championship Game: Raiders 52, Broncos 51, on a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Kansas City. New pregame introductions for the Chiefs this season: 
"Starting at quarterback, No. 19, Joe Montana. Finishing at quarterback, No. 
13, Steve Bono." New stat for Chiefs quarterbacks this season: Complete games. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Miami. Two words: Dan Marino. Two more words: Achilles heel. Yeah, tell Don 
Shula about it. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Green Bay. According to Pro Football Weekly, "the sky is the limit" with 
young Packer quarterback Brett Favre. Well, I have seen Favre throw and let me 
tell you: The sky is no limit. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Arizona. They said Buddy Ryan would never coach in this league again. They 
forgot Bill (Beavis) Bidwill still owns a team in this league. They forgot 
there are teams that could use some more fannies in the seats in this league. 
They forgot the Buddy Ryan Traveling All-Stars -- Seth Joyner, Clyde Simmons, 
Jim McMahon, Terry Hoage -- would follow their beloved old coot to the ends of 
the earth, or Phoenix, or is that redundant? What next? How about 9-7 and Buddy 
in the conference semifinals? 
</P>
<P>
 9. Buffalo. If we give them a baseball team, do you think maybe they'll go 
away and leave us alone? 
</P>
<P>
 10. Minnesota. What do Joe Kapp, Fran Tarkenton and Warren Moon have in 
common? You got it. None of them have won a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Houston. No, Oiler games just won't be the same without Moon standing 
there on the sideline, breaking up bare-knuckled brawls between assistant 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 12. Detroit. Scott Mitchell has been in the league five years, didn't start a 
game during the first four, then started four games in 1993, then hurt his 
shoulder, then started the last three games of 1993 and lost them all. Noting 
this, the Lions immediately signed Mitchell to a free-agent contract worth $11 
million, plus a $5-million signing bonus. The Great Detroit Lion Super Bowl 
Dynasty, explained at last. 
</P>
<P>
 13. Pittsburgh. Needs to trade for some offensive help. Too bad the L.A. Kings 
aren't in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 14. Philadelphia. Game to watch -- Nov. 6, Buddy Ryan and the Cardinals at 
Eagles. At home, Rich Kotite feels like a tourist. 
</P>
<P>
 15. New York Giants. In case you forget why the baseball players are striking, 
Phil Simms will be happy to remind you. 
</P>
<P>
 16. New England. I still want to know where they got those uniforms. USFL 
garage sale? Or Arena Football hand-me-downs? 
</P>
<P>
 17. Cleveland. Where have you gone, Mark Rypien? Trust me, you don't want to 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 18. Seattle. Dangerous objects have been falling onto the floor of the 
Kingdome for years. That's why the Seahawks finally had to go out and draft 
Rick Mirer. 
</P>
<P>
 19. San Diego. Do the ends justify the Means? In the Chargers' offense they 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 20. Atlanta. The Falcons had to fire Jerry Glanville because he was too 
controversial, too unpredictable and too unstable a personality. So they bring 
in Jeff George. 
</P>
<P>
 21. Rams. They went 0-4 during the 1993 exhibition season and 0-4 during the 
1994 exhibition season. They went 6-10 during the 1992 regular season and 5-11 
during the 1993 regular season. Conclusive proof that the Rams aren't moving 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 22. New Orleans. Jim Everett gets a new lease on life. That's right -- first 
and last months' rent, plus cleaning deposit, within walking distance of the 
French Quarter, utilities not included. 
</P>
<P>
 23. Tampa Bay. Game to watch -- Dec. 11, Rams at Buccaneers. Over-under on 
Trent Dilfer that day is four touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 24. Chicago. Last year, Dave Wannstedt thought Jim Harbaugh was the answer at 
quarterback. This year, Wannstedt thinks Erik Kramer is the answer at 
quarterback. Wannstedt was a very good defensive coordinator when he was with 
the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 25. New York Jets. When Ronnie Lott agreed to accept a pay cut to help the 
team squeeze a couple more salaries under the cap, the Jets said they needed 
more players just like him. Now they're scouting 6-foot-1, 203-pound, 
35-year-old offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 26. Indianapolis. Sporting event traditionally witnessed by millions of 
Americans: Indianapolis 500. Sporting event almost never witnessed by millions 
of Americans: Indianapolis, .500. 
</P>
<P>
 27. Cincinnati. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, Don Shula once told 
his son David. No, but sometimes it lands at the bottom of the AFC Central and 
just rots there. 
</P>
<P>
 28. Washington. Game to watch -- Dec. 24, Redskins at Rams. Season finale for 
both. Loser leaves town.

RAMS '94 / SEASON PREVIEW; CHUCK'S LAST STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The end of a fine, fine coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins with a whisper: Chuck Knox, 62, is too old to get the job done any 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 It becomes a question, a rhetorical question: Has the game passed him by? 
</P>
<P>
 The television cameras linger favorably upon a fiery Bill Cowher, an energetic 
Dave Wannstedt, an enthusiastic Dennis Green. 
</P>
<P>
 Commentators note that Marv Levy takes teams to the Super Bowl, Jimmy Johnson 
wins them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just common knowledge: Dan Reeves rebuilds the Giants overnight; Buddy 
Ryan sells tickets; Mike Holmgren puts the Packers in the playoffs; Bill 
Parcells revs up fans in New England. 
</P>
<P>
 And Chuck Knox has lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 49ers are going to continue to dominate the NFC West Division," said Pat 
Haden, TV commentator and former Ram. "It's just not going to happen in the 
next two years for the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 But it has to happen this year, and in sensational fashion, for Knox to remain 
employed. He might have two years remaining on a four-year contract, but around 
the National Football League it's a foregone conclusion: Unless there's a 
miracle, Knox is history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is time running out, yes," said Joe Vitt, Knox's friend and Ram assistant 
head coach. "We've been here for two years and we've built this football team 
in Chuck's image. The expectancy is there, the performance must be there and we 
have got to be held accountable for what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 As if it matters. If the Rams are going to move, they are not going to sully 
their fresh start elsewhere with a stale coach. If the Rams are not going to 
move, they are not going to regain the affection of long-lost fans with Knox 
droning, "Football players win football games." 
</P>
<P>
 Leave or stay, no matter. Knox can't win. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox's car sits covered with a tarpaulin at training camp, day after day, 
night after night. He won't be going home or dining out. The man who is too old 
to coach is right on top of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox has that fine focus, as he likes to say, and there is no doubt who is in 
charge here. But it is 10 o'clock at night and he is still reviewing videotape, 
admittedly concerned about an offensive line not fulfilling expectations, and 
getting nowhere in his day-long efforts to correct the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems, and more problems, and it has been five frustrating years since a 
team he has coached has fared any better than third place in division 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills and Seahawks were very Ram-like when Knox arrived, but never so bad 
later under his tutelage as the Rams (11-21) have continued to be. 
</P>
<P>
 What's wrong with the Rams? All agree, on paper they appear so much stronger, 
but on the field they show no spark, none of the competitive toughness that 
traditionally characterize a Knox-coached team. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins again with a whisper: Knox is just mailing it in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't buy it," said Joe Gibbs, TV commentator and former Washington head 
coach. "I talked to Chuck this off-season, and I was out there in Anaheim this 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember going off into a corner with Chuck and asking, 'Why are you doing 
this?' The man's got enough money and things like that where he doesn't need 
this, but I asked, 'Why are you doing this?' 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked me right in the eye and growled, 'I want to win the Super Bowl.' 
Shoot, I felt it; he's driven inside to do that and I think the Rams are very 
fortunate to have a guy who's proven and who has a formula. Those kind of guys 
are very hard to find." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Knox football. Say it aloud and immediately a no-nonsense image presents 
itself. The man has a specific way of doing things, and the man has been 
nothing but successful. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were 54-15 in his first tour of duty here. He took doormat Buffalo to 
a division title, and duplicated the feat in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have a formula, a way of getting the job done," Gibbs said. "Very 
few guys have it really. You take a Bill Parcells team and it will have its own 
look. He has a formula, give him enough time and he's going to produce a 
winner. That's Chuck. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't many people who have been able to do that, and Chuck's been able 
to do it with more than one group of people. He's done it over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
 He has been doing this for 21 years as a head coach, and only Don Shula, 
George Halas, Tom Landry, Curly Lambeau and Chuck Noll have more victories in 
the NFL than Knox. He is the only coach in the 75-year history of the league to 
win division championships for three organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "His football teams are sound, not very flamboyant, but sound," said Boston 
College Coach Dan Henning, who coached against Knox while at San Diego, 
Detroit, Atlanta and Washington. "He always had a scheme that was liberal and 
flamboyant, but you knew he wouldn't come after you that way until it was 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believes in percentages. Go back to that Seattle team, they would be 
behind and a number of times they'd come back in flamboyant fashion to win. 
People would say how come he doesn't do that all the time? Chuck was smarter 
than that. With the kind of talent he had, if he had played that way all the 
time he would have lost more games on errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy hasn't won a Super Bowl, but I know this, when you lined up against 
one of his teams, I don't care what kind of talent he had, you knew he was 
capable of beating you." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys, who went on to win the Super Bowl, lost only three 
regular-season games in 1992, including one contest in Texas Stadium -- to 
Knox's Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you trying to tell me Chuck Knox is in a no-win situation?" said Dick 
Vermeil, who worked previously with Knox. "No way Chuck Knox is ever in a 
no-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams doubled their victories in his first year back on the job, but last 
season was a torturous journey culminating in a 5-11 finish. 
</P>
<P>
 But as bad as it was, there is the memory of victory early on in Houston and 
the tears welling in Knox's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you want to talk Chuck Knox, you call me," Vermeil said. "I know how 
much he cares about what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Watch the sideline, however, and it does not always appear as if he is 
breathing. Mike Ditka oozed emotion; Knox needs to be nudged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intense? There's no doubt it," said Jackie Slater, who has heard more 
pre-game speeches than most anyone else. "You can just feel his expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I ever got to know Chuck, Dennis Harrah told me, 'Chuck Knox will put 
the fear of God in you.' There's just something about the guy that demands 
respect and professionalism. There's no doubt in my mind why he's been 
successful everywhere he's gone: He just demands it. He doesn't say all that 
much, it's just his presence." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams stink, however, and Mt. Rushmore has failed to inspire. The team has 
provided no hope to date for better days ahead in 1994, and there are those 
whispers, those questions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, lining up offsides is not Chuck Knox being too old," Vitt said. "We 
have a young tackle lining up offsides five times, now is he doing that because 
Chuck Knox is senile? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's coaching exactly the same way now as he did when we were in the AFC 
championship game in Seattle. He's going to let his players play and his 
coaches coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddsmakers in Las Vegas say that won't be enough to change the Rams' fortunes. 
They have set the over-and-under for the number of games the Rams will win this 
year at five. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man has overcome adversity all his life," said Reggie McKenzie, Seattle 
Seahawk executive and former player for Knox. "Oh, what a motivator; the very 
best." 
</P>
<P>
 With this year's Ram team, Knox is confronted with Lazarus, and the great 
motivator might have met his match. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a game of people, and if you don't have the people you're in trouble," 
said Hank Stram, TV commentator and former head coach. "What were they saying 
about Tom Landry and Chuck Noll a few years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just ridiculous to say: The game has passed him by. That's like saying 
five years after competing in the Olympics, a swimmer can't swim anymore. How 
stupid can you be? 
</P>
<P>
 "How old was Ronald Reagan when he was President of the United States? If he's 
not too old to be president, Chuck Knox is not too old to coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a team there that's talking about moving, the fans are very 
lethargic and that rubs off on the players. It's tough enough to win when 
things are going good." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a way to win when no one expects such success has been a Knox 
trademark. Buffalo had been dreadful, and after rebuilding with 5-11 and 7-9 
campaigns, including back-to-back 0-4 performances in exhibition play, Knox's 
Bills leapfrogged to 11-5 to win the AFC East title. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Curt Warner, "the franchise" in Seattle, suffered a season-ending 
knee injury in the regular-season opener in 1984. It appeared the Seahawks were 
finished, but Knox guided them to a 12-4 record and the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows how to win," said Mike McCormack, Carolina Panthers general manager 
and former Seahawk GM. "We go to Miami for a playoff game, we have to wait five 
hours in an airport for a plane to be fixed, we get to our hotel at 3 a.m. and 
it's one big potential disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck doesn't blink. He puts in a new formation on Saturday morning, it works 
and we win. Incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Lazarus, however, beckons. 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell me, who is going to coach that team to an NFC West Division 
championship?" Haden said. "The organization has drafted miserably over the 
years, and while it's been corrected some since Chuck's arrival, the talent 
level has been down for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say what you want about Chuck Knox, and I honestly can't say if the game has 
passed him by, but what coach can win with that personnel?" 
</P>
<P>
 The way Knox had it figured, he was going to coach this team to win. A year 
ago he was talking playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck went down there thinking he had an outstanding quarterback in Jim 
Everett," McCormack said. "Chuck had never had that great quarterback before. 
He did the job in Seattle with Dave Krieg, James Harris and Pat Haden with the 
Rams, Joe Ferguson in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of us empathize with Chuck, because with Jim Everett it seemed 
like he had that quality quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox begins anew with Chris Miller, but that's Keith Loneker, Clarence Jones 
and Darryl Ashmore blocking for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I judge him now versus 18 years ago when I was playing for him, he's 
probably hungrier to win now than then," Slater said. "I can relate to some of 
the things he's dealing with. 
</P>
<P>
 "People wonder because of my age if I still have that fire, that desire, and 
when I hear that it just turns up my intensity." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rams have no chance of succeeding in 1994. Another losing season 
appears all but guaranteed, and just where will that leave Knox? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will bring back a lot of the old Chuck, that old steel mill 
guy," said Lawrence McCutcheon, Ram scout and former player for Knox. "I know 
that will be his reaction. I think he will show us all that he still has that 
fire, that desire to win. I wouldn't want to tell him there's no chance of 
winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Sit across the desk from Knox and ask the questions: Are you too old? Has the 
game passed you by? Have you just mailed it in? 
</P>
<P>
 Knox is one of the game's most accommodating and accessible coaches in the 
NFL. He will never compete for space in Bartlett's Favorite Quotations, but 
this is a gentleman who conducts business fairly at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's why you can sit across that desk and ask these questions: 
</P>
<P>
 Are you too old to keep doing this? 
</P>
<P>
 Knox: "Is Marv Levy too old? Don Shula? I hear this stuff, and yes, it hurts, 
but I'm working as hard as I can work." 
</P>
<P>
 Has the game passed you by? 
</P>
<P>
 Knox: "I don't think it's passed us by. We had the best organized training 
camp we've had, I think we're on top of the thing, and no, I don't think I'm 
taking things a step slower." 
</P>
<P>
 Are you just mailing it in? 
</P>
<P>
 Knox: "I didn't get to where I am today without working hard. If this 
situation doesn't get turned around it won't be because we didn't work hard." 
</P>
<P>
 But people are looking for more; they want someone to turn this program 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox: "I don't know where that person is." 
</P>
<P>
 It's supposed to be you. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox: "I think I have as good a chance as anybody to do it because I've done 
it. Who are you going to get that's done it before?" 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think it's a no-win situation, what with the prospect of moving or not 
moving? 
</P>
<P>
 Knox: "Do you think if there was a 35-year-old coach here in his third year on 
the job under the same circumstances, the same thing wouldn't apply? 
</P>
<P>
 "The only defense I can offer is that I have worked hard, and now we just have 
to wait and see what the outcome is going to be. If we don't achieve the goals 
we have set, somebody else has to make the decision about whether Chuck Knox is 
going to coach this team or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Long hours, more videotape, and Knox doesn't figure to go quietly into the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's take a look at it this way," Vitt said. "Here's a man that because of 
this game is financially independent. Here's a man that has raised four great 
kids. Here's a man that has three grandchildren that he adores. And here's a 
man doing something, not because he has to do it, but because he wants to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could walk away at any time, but he made the statement to me, 'Palm 
Springs is God's waiting room to die,' and he's not ready to retire to his 
condo in Palm Springs. He's still ready to get after some people's asses, and 
that ought to make a lot of people in this league concerned."

RAMS '94 / SEASON PREVIEW; RAMS APPEAR TO BE HEADING FOR ANOTHER SLAUGHTER; 
ANALYSIS: AFTER ANOTHER DISMAL EXHIBITION SEASON, TEAM FACES GRIM TASK OF 
PLAYING 16 GAMES THAT COUNT. DESPITE EVIDENCE, COACHES SAY THEY'RE READY.

<P>
 Sifting through the debris, in what has become an annual ritual of despair, 
the Rams decided early this week to play on this season. 
</P>
<P>
 A close vote, no doubt, but a month ago -- before four lackluster exhibition 
losses and a belly-flop by their offensive line -- the Rams had the look of a 
winner, or at the very least, a team with a chance to be the most improved in 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Miller had been hired to play quarterback, and with two healthy legs 
beneath him he has proved to be both accurate and effective. Jimmie Jones, 
recruited heavily by a number of teams, took the Rams' money to play alongside 
defensive tackle Sean Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of linebacker Joe Kelly, safety Marquez Pope, running back Johnny 
Bailey and wide receiver Jessie Hester provided something the Rams have been 
sorely lacking: depth. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Rams already had Jerome Bettis, Flipper Anderson, Todd Lyght, Robert 
Young, Bern Brostek, Shane Conlan, Roman Phifer and Steve Israel on the 
payroll, and that's not exactly the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 "On paper, it's a better team," said Bettis, who was the NFL's No. 2 rusher as 
a rookie last season. "But after what's happened in the preseason the team 
doesn't have an enormous amount of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 No, not much to build on here. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gandy, the team's No. 1 draft selection, failed to beat out some guy 
named Clarence Jones at left tackle. The coaching staff anointed Bill Schultz 
starting left guard, played him there for the second half of the exhibition 
season, and then cut him as preparations began for the regular-season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Loneker, previously known best for having a Jayhawk tattoo on his lower 
leg, is now the guy protecting Miller at left guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows who will start opposite Flipper Anderson at wide receiver? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still early yet," Coach Chuck Knox said after the end of the exhibition 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams scored three touchdowns in four exhibition games, allowed their 
opponents to complete 66% of their passes and throw for nine touchdowns. In 
first-half play, when most teams match starting units, the Rams were outscored 
65-19. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to play the games that count, and history suggests it will be 
business as usual: The Rams have dropped four consecutive regular-season 
openers, including the last two by a combined score of 76-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Not good, and now they get Buddy Ryan's blitzing in-your-face Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you talk about opening at home against the Arizona Cardinals and Buddy 
Ryan, it's a dream come true for this football team," said Joe Vitt, Ram 
assistant head coach. "Everybody thinks we're terrible: The coaches can't 
coach; the players can't play; the administration doesn't know how to 
administrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't ask for a better scenario than to have Buddy Ryan and his football 
team come in here for the opener. We will line up and play this game the way 
it's supposed to be played. The Cardinals are going to know they have been in a 
football game, and we fully expect to win this football game." 
</P>
<P>
 We fully expect to win this football game . . .  
</P>
<P>
 After winning only 19 of their last 64 games, how can anyone employed by the 
Rams say such a thing? 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely no doubts," Vitt said. "Let me tell you something, I feel as good 
about this football team right now as I did six weeks ago when we went to 
training camp fully expecting to be a playoff team. We still believe we're a 
playoff team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to correct our mistakes, play with more poise and more confidence and 
we will be. Nobody believes that. Everybody is off the bandwagon now except for 
these 10 coaches and players, but that's fine. We have upgraded our personnel, 
we've worked hard and now it's time to step up and show it." QUARTERBACK 
</P>
<P>
 Rams might have the best threesome in league in Miller, Chris Chandler and 
Tommy Maddox, and good thing, looking at the offensive line they have 
assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who has had a history of knee problems, should complete a high 
percentage of his passes and has the arm to burn defenses deep if they creep 
forward to stop Bettis. Chandler has starting experience, and Maddox is the 
Rams' future. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What's the over-and-under on how many games Miller starts? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Note to T-shirt entrepreneurs in Baltimore -- your future quarterback 
is currently wearing No. 8. RUNNING BACK 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis carried the ball only 20 times in the exhibition season because of 
Knox's paranoia about him getting hurt. But Bettis hinted that that wasn't 
enough work to prepare him for the regular season. Rams can't afford a slow 
start from "The Franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis wants 2,000 yards, a chance to top Dallas' Emmitt Smith, but this year 
defenses will be gunning for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams rely so much on Bettis that it makes no sense that they released Gary. 
Who steps in for Bettis if he gets nicked? Howard Griffith and James Bostic? 
Wave the white flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey provides pep on third downs much like Ronnie Harmon does in San Diego, 
but someone's going to have to issue Super Glue to David Lang if they are going 
to put the ball in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Does Bettis get the chance to top Eric Dickerson's team record of 
404 rushing attempts in 1986? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Smith plays for a winner, Bettis doesn't. Smith gets the ball to run 
out the clock in second half, Bettis watches from sideline as Rams throw to 
catch up. RECEIVER 
</P>
<P>
 At season's end everyone will know: Was it Jim Everett? Or was it Anderson's 
fault? Anderson has had three consecutive forgettable seasons and the Rams 
contend it's because Everett struggled throwing the ball deep. Miller's 
strength is the long ball, and so Anderson gets the chance to shine. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the opposition might elect not to cover the Rams' other 
starting wide receiver and concentrate on Anderson. The best thing that can be 
said about Anderson's running mate is that it will be a warm body. 
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis no longer wanted Jessie Hester and Indianapolis does not figure 
to challenge Buffalo for Super Bowl consideration. Hester, however, competes 
for starting time with Isaac Bruce, the team's No. 2 draft pick, who doesn't 
always run to the right spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Tight end Troy Drayton has shown the ability to save the day, but Ram 
quarterbacks ignored the big target in exhibition play. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How much of a difference to this team would Haywood Jeffires or 
Alvin Harper have meant? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Don't be surprised if Drayton leads team in receptions this season. 
OFFENSIVE LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
 What do these guys have against Miller? You'd think they were conspiring to 
make Chandler the starting quarterback, but then that's Chandler holding his 
sore ribs because these guys can't stop anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams used their first-round pick on tackle Wayne Gandy. Why? He looks like a 
guard, plays like an undrafted free agent and is currently sitting on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Ashmore gets his 117th chance to replace senior citizen Jackie Slater 
at right tackle, and surprise, surprise, Knox says such a move is not etched in 
stone. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about scary: Loneker starts at left guard right next to Clarence Jones at 
left tackle and these two guys will be responsible for protecting Miller's 
blindside. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What's the name, rank and serial number of the genius who allowed 
Gerald Perry to defect to the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Tom Newberry has started 114 games for this team and is now deemed 
not good enough to play. What's in the water these coaches are drinking? 
DEFENSIVE LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries sabotaged performance in exhibition games, but if this group fails to 
unite in fearsome fashion, the Rams' defense collapses. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, Young, Jones and Fred Stokes looks like a mighty fine line, but 
Young, coming off knee surgery, had no impact in exhibition play and Stokes is 
trying to overcome a sore knee. Gilbert injured an ankle and Jones hurt a 
wrist. Time for a visit to Lourdes, because there's nobody on the bench to 
throw a scare into the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: If Knox was so concerned about getting people hurt before the season 
began, why was Gilbert, who injured an ankle and knee on the play, rushing the 
quarterback with less than a minute to play in the half against the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Defense has a chance to keep the Rams in every game, but Young's 
return is essential to that plan. LINEBACKER 
</P>
<P>
 Phifer and Conlan should be dependable and successful. Phifer is ready to 
emerge as one of the game's top linebackers, while Conlan still has speed and 
grit to shut down an opponent's running game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly gets the edge over Henry Rolling for left outside linebacker, but can 
the Rams afford to keep two veteran outside linebackers (Rolling and Chris 
Martin) on the bench? 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Do people really realize just how good of a player Conlan still is? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Serious knee injury to rookie Ernest Jones leaves Rams with a void of 
talented youngsters at all three linebacker positions. DEFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
<P>
 Starting cornerbacks Todd Lyght and Steve Israel have raised expectations for 
an 0-16 season. Lyght, who was playing like a Pro Bowl performer before being 
hurt last year, had no clue in exhibition play. Israel, who has great speed, 
looked like he was in a different area code when assigned to cover a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams chose to keep Wymon Henderson and Dexter Davis instead of Darryl Henley, 
which is the plot for new Charles Bronson Death Wish movie. Steve Young threw 
for 482 yards against the likes of Henderson and Davis, and Young comes to town 
in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong safety will be played by committee: Pope and Toby Wright. Anthony 
Newman anchors the defense at free safety, and Keith Lyle offers promise down 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: After watching videotape of the Rams this exhibition season, do you 
think the opposition will come looking for Lyght? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: You would think these guys were all former soccer players with 
instructions not to use their hands; no one on this team had more than two 
interceptions last year. SPECIAL TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey and Lang are explosive on kickoff returns and Bailey's also a threat on 
punt returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of Wayne Sevier, one of the game's most respected special teams 
coaches, during off-season bodes well. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicker Tony Zendejas, otherwise known as the Rams' offense, remains 
consistent, and punter Sean Landeta is a proven contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What's the NFL record for most penalties called on special teams in 
a season? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Whatever it is, Rams won't be denied.

RAMS '94 / SEASON PREVIEW; ONE MORE TIME FOR ANAHEIM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams, playing perhaps their last season in Anaheim, hope the running of 
tailback Jerome Bettis and the acquisition of several key free agents will 
improve them after a disappointing 5-11 season in 1993. The Depth Chart 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive line will be tested by some of the league's top defensive ends. 
Clarence Jones, a free-agent acquisition from the New York Giants, will start 
at left tackle. Keith Loneker, a second-year player, will start at left guard, 
replacing Tom Newberry. Darryl Ashmore, was to start at right tackle, but 
19-year veteran Jackie Slater will keep his job at least for the opener.

 The Rams' offense and defense made major adjustments through free-agency and 
trades in the off-season. Gone are quarterback Jim Everett (traded to New 
Orleans), starting strong safety Michael Stewart (signed by Miami), strong 
safety Pat Terrell (New York Jets) and tight end Pat Carter (Houston), the key 
blocker on sweep plays with tailback Jerome Bettis. Key starters obtained 
through free agency are quarterback Chris Miller from Atlanta and defensive 
tackle Jimmie Jones (Dallas). Wayne Gandy, the Rams' top draft pick, is 
projected to eventually start at left tackle, and second-round selection Toby 
Wright is pressing for Stewart's vacated strong safety position. Nostalgia Game 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will wear gold replica jerseys from the 1951 NFL championship team 
for their Sept. 18 home game against San Francisco, in honor of the league's 
75th anniversary. They wore the gold with blue numbers throughout most of the 
1950s but changed in 1957 when networks began televising some games. The 
problem: Blue-on-gold numbers were difficult to read on black-and-white TV 
sets. Solution: A switch to the more visible blue jerseys with light numbers. 
New Kid on the Block 
</P>
<P>
 New quarterback Chris Miller was 9 when he first met Ram Coach Chuck Knox at a 
Punt Pass and Kick competition. Miller, who was born in Pomona and grew up in 
Claremont, considers himself a longtime Ram fan, even though he moved to 
Eugene, Ore., at age 10. "I grew up following James Harris, Jack Youngblood and 
yeah, what's the name of that guy who wore No. 18 -- Roman Gabriel." Gabriel is 
the team's second-leading all-time passer. Where and When

RAMS '94 / SEASON PREVIEW; MOORE JUST ENJOYS TALKING THE TALK; FOOTBALL: OTHER 
COACHES SAY HIS DISCUSSIONS CAN BECOME A STREAM OF SEMICONSCIOUSNESS IF YOU LET 
HIM GET OUT OF CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram wide receiver coach Steve Moore speaks, and Sominex goes out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it got late at training camp and we couldn't sleep, we called Moore down 
to talk to us," said Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head coach. "Never failed. We'd 
nod off right away." 
</P>
<P>
 True story: During a recent interview with Moore, the tape recorder in use 
drifted off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't always talk like that," Moore said. "I say . . . every once in a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he can cuss like a real-live professional football coach, he knows his 
X's and O's as well as any of them, and his track record as an offensive 
strategist has been well documented in NFL record manuals. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's his spiel, his proclivity to chatter in a language foreign to the 
gridiron that demands ear plugs or prompt a good night's sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best word for Steve," said Mike Martz, Ram quarterback coach, "is 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 Very different. Vitt and Martz talk Vince Lombardi and Bill Walsh. Moore 
gushes Edward Demming. 
</P>
<P>
 "He helped turn us into a war machine for World War II," Moore said. "At the 
end of the war, when (General Douglas) MacArthur was given the task of the 
reconstruction of Japan, Japan asked that Demming come over and redesign how 
they do business. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is probably the single most important reason for the economic miracle of 
Japan. Today the most important business award given on TV in Japan is the 
Demming Award." 
</P>
<P>
 Is this guy for real? 
</P>
<P>
 "All I remember," said Martz, who played for Moore at UC Santa Barbara, "is he 
kept wanting to hang garlic in my locker." 
</P>
<P>
 Garlic? 
</P>
<P>
 "I found when I was playing for Steve," Martz said, "I just didn't ask many 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there is no pause in Moore's delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Demming was a statistician. He had 14 points of focus, the first of which is 
to get a clear aim. He's heavy into process. He's heavy into upper-lower 
control limits of variance analysis, which means he's going to be a very 
fact-based decision-maker." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, yeah, but what position does he play? 
</P>
<P>
 "And the feedback loop, which you get as a result of having statistical 
measurement, is what allows you to get better," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a public service -- for those still here -- be forewarned that driving or 
the use of heavy machinery is not advised while reviewing the following 
material. Also, some terms used below defy explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, Boeing may have 30,000 errors per million," Moore said. "To be 
in the sixth sigma level of total quality management you operate at 3,000 
errors per million. There are companies in Japan who are not measuring errors 
per million anymore; they're measuring errors per billion. It's reducing the 
variance of errors. Are you with me? And it has a tremendous amount to do with 
what we're doing around here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now just put that off to the side for a minute and let's talk about the 
Pareto Principle. He (Vilfredo Pareto) was an 18th century Italian economist 
who found that like 80% of the food producing land is owned by 20% of the 
population. That 80-20 rule . . . if you identify your most significant two 
challenges that are holding you back, then you're going to improve 80% of your 
results. Are you with me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Can Mr. Pareto explain why the Rams lose eight out of every 10 football games 
they play? 
</P>
<P>
 Moore pays no attention to such asides. "In football, for example, if we can 
make sure we're doing the most important things well, and finding ways to give 
ourselves feedback to continually improve them, I think that's a pretty good 
message. If you don't go out with some sort of objective measure of 
improvement, then it's just, 'I think this,' or 'I think that.' There's no 
accountability or the structural tension to create the energy to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "By structural tension I mean this motivation . . . when there's this 
separation between the way it is and the way you'd like it to be. There's a 
creative tension to close the gap, and unless you are provided feedback: Here, 
let me draw something for you." 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have no goal at all, there's still some motivation. As soon as I 
establish a long-term goal like we're going to win the Super Bowl, what happens 
to a team is that motivation goes down because we're going to get around to it. 
Long-term goals by themselves are meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that long-term goal is supported by a short-term goal (win one game at a 
time) there's a nice increase in motivation. When that short-term goal is 
supported by a process goal or how we're actually going to do it, then 
motivation goes way up here like this. If I'm not provided feedback, I lose 
that benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can identify key things, soon that problem disappears and there's 
another biggest problem to take on. Now you're dealing with the theory of 
constraints." 
</P>
<P>
 Hello, is anybody home? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all these things have everything in the world to do with football," 
Moore concluded. "I know I might come off half-goofy, but I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Knox, the hard-core football coach, hired Moore: to teach the Bills; to 
teach the Seahawks; to teach the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve Largent gave Steve Moore a lot of credit for the success he had," Knox 
said. "He's a very bright guy who knows a lot about football." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore worked as Knox's offensive coordinator and the Seahawks led the NFL in 
third down efficiency in 1988 and set a club record by averaging 5.4 yards a 
play in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "He starts off every meeting with either a psychological theory or some sort 
of story from the business world," said wide receiver Todd Kinchen. "He's very 
down-to-earth, but he's also very intelligent. It's a different approach, but I 
was a psychology minor at LSU and so I appreciate some of the things he 
communicates with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Demming had to rebuild Japan, but Moore's challenge appears far more daunting: 
Make something of the Ram receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Flipper Anderson has been living off a reputation made in 1989 and 1990. The 
past three years he's been just another mediocre receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie Hester returns to Los Angeles after getting fired in Indianapolis. The 
Raiders dealt him to Atlanta in 1988 and then the Falcons cut him in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Bruce and Chris Brantley are two rookies who aren't good enough to beat 
out Hester yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm supposed to be a football coach, but I'm really a teacher," Moore said. 
"The night before we practice I have each player write down what they want to 
get out of practice. I don't want a dozen things, but just take the thing 
that's holding you back the most and let's get that done tomorrow. Are you with 
me? 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that's the theory of constraints. Now, did you record the number of 
catches, the number of balls that hit both hands and number of times you caught 
the ball? Mark that down -- now that's goal-setting and feedback tied to 
process. Are you with me? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're setting out to improve, you better have a record of your 
improvement. Each of our players has a catch chart. We're trying to catch 95% 
of all catchable balls -- that's a ball that touches both hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how I do it. That's how I teach. Does it make sense?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Richard Buchanan provides the answer: "This preseason we didn't 
have any drops. If you look back, I think that's a definite improvement from 
what's happened here before." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore rejoined Knox & Co. this year after spending the previous five years in 
private business. His company, Moore Solutions, did strategic and operational 
planning for financial institutions -- far removed from the gridiron. 
</P>
<P>
 While never much of a fan of football, he couldn't escape the game's lure, and 
began looking for a way to return two years ago. Offensive coordinator Ernie 
Zampese's departure to Dallas and wide receiver coach Milt Jackson's departure 
to Atlanta allowed Moore the opportunity to reunite with Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has his books, his motivational and goal-setting stuff and he will quote 
from those," said Chick Harris, Ram offensive coordinator. "That's Steve, and 
now I know who Drucker is."

<P>
 Played for the Cowboys in the early '70s, didn't he? 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter Drucker," Moore said. "He's probably the best known business writer of 
our time. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I just mess with people all the time. There's a lot of good 
information there, too, but I tease with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tease him about being the wacky football coach, however, and he doesn't like 
it. He works very hard, too hard, some say, at being the best football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work hard, try to outwork everybody because I thought that was the only way 
to become successful," he said. "I didn't think I was quite as smart as 
everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 On the practice field he is a cheerleader, providing direction and an 
immediate assessment cloaked most often in positive reinforcement. In staff 
meetings, he's the nagging voice at the back of the room challenging the way 
they have always done things around here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been cantankerous in the past, but not here," Moore said. "Sometimes I 
get such a sense of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I do challenge every assumption that doesn't make sense to me . . . I 
hate authority, absolutely hate authority, assumptions and being painted into a 
box and I hate people telling me we can't do this or can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 He was offensive coordinator in Seattle, but now he's working for a guy 
(Harris) who used to work for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've got the most important job in the world right now," Moore said. 
"I've always had long-term, short-term goals, but what I decided to do when I 
came here was suspend any long-term plans and enjoy the now. It's very unlike 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore continues to study videotape, however, and run morning to night as if a 
posse were in pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watch his players," Harris said. "They practice and play with the same energy 
level that he has." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore says his football players are brilliant, yes, brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were brought up jocks and they don't know how brilliant they are. All 
you need to do is let them discover that and present information in ways that 
they can get it, as opposed to ways they were always taught in schools. The way 
they were taught in schools was modeled after the Prussian army by the way." 
</P>
<P>
 About that garlic hanging in the locker . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you about self-efficacy," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garlic stinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Albert Bandura, a wonderful researcher at Stanford," Moore said. "Most cited 
researcher in the world. He says people are limited more by their beliefs than 
their ability. That is self-efficacy. It's my perception of my ability to make 
things happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may know all about that, but I kind of like knowing the name of this 
stuff. I kind of like knowing there is a body of science that supports such a 
point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you with me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yo, wake up.

 Willie Anderson, 83 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh Year 
</P>
<P>
 Wide Receiver 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA 
</P>
<P>
 Was it Jim Everett or Flipper? Rams think Everett's inability to throw the 
deep pass threw Flipper into a funk. Last three years have been a disaster, but 
now he's in the final year of his contract and there's a chance to get rich if 
he plays as well as he did in 1990. 
</P>

 Darryl Ashmore, 77 
</P>
<P>
 Third Year 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive Tackle 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern 
</P>
<P>
 Fell short of locking up the right tackle position in training camp. Will be 
the team's starting right tackle, but when? Has seven career starts, but looked 
slow when confronted by a speedy pass rusher. Team can't afford to have both 
Gandy and Ashmore on bench. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Johnny Bailey, 42 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth Year 
</P>
<P>
 Running Back 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&I 
</P>
<P>
 Has the potential to juice up both the offense and special teams. One of 
game's most dangerous punt and kick returners, and flashed game-breaking speed 
as third-down back in exhibition play. 49er-like offense will allow Bailey to 
roll up big numbers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Robert Bailey, 28 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth Year 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback 
</P>
<P>
 Miami (Fla.) 
</P>
<P>
 Subject of trade talks, but team needs a long list of reliable cornerbacks to 
contend with opposition who plays four wide receivers. Lack of size hurts when 
playing teams like San Francisco and Atlanta, but he has the man-to-man skills 
that make him valuable as nickel back. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Chuck Belin, 71 
</P>
<P>
 Second Year 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive Guard 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin 
</P>
<P>
 Earned first-year pay as spectator and practice-squad scrub. Had chance to 
replace Tom Newberry and become starting left guard in training camp, but blew 
it. Hangs around on roster because he's young, salary is low and he remains two 
years away from free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Bettis, 36 
</P>
<P>
 Second Year 
</P>
<P>
 Running Back 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame 
</P>
<P>
 He's "The Show," and he has set his sights on 2,000 yards. Only chance to get 
it is if Rams are still in the game come the fourth quarter. An effective 
Miller figures to keep defenses honest and open it up for Bettis. If he learns 
how to catch, just imagine how dangerous he will be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 James Bostic, 33 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie 
</P>
<P>
 Running Back 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn 
</P>
<P>
 A third-round draft pick, but to date he has done nothing to excite the Rams. 
Sound familiar? Russell White was a third-round pick two years ago and was 
dismissed prior to training camp. More a tailback than a fullback, and appears 
headed to practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Brady, 48 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie 
</P>
<P>
 Tight End 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't figure to be a year to be remembered. If chance is afforded for him 
to play, it will be to block. Loss of Pat Carter hurts, and Brady's 
inexperience will leave him standing on the sideline or asking for special 
teams time. Maybe next year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Chris Brantley, 88 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie 
</P>
<P>
 Wide Receiver 
</P>
<P>
 Rutgers 
</P>
<P>
 Started off brilliantly in training camp, and the No. 4 pick was overshadowing 
Bruce, the No. 2 pick. But hamstring injury brought him back to earth and 
slowed his progress. Lacks deep speed. Probably starts off as No. 4 receiver or 
No. 5, depending on where Buchanan fits in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bern Brostek, 61 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth Year 
</P>
<P>
 Center 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so they catch him holding a lot, but he's still the only dependable 
blocker along a shaky offensive line. Missed three plays in last 32 games, has 
started 36 consecutive contests and will remain unchallenged for some time with 
only Newberry backing him up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Bruce, 80 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie 
</P>
<P>
 Wide Receiver 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis State 
</P>
<P>
 Depends what day of the week it is: Some days he looks good, some days he 
doesn't. That's what you get with a rookie. Will be team's starting receiver 
once he develops consistency. Didn't get as many practice reps as he probably 
should have, but then Rams had a cast of thousands seeking work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Buchanan, 89 
</P>
<P>
 Second Year 
</P>
<P>
 Wide Receiver 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern 
</P>
<P>
 Best set of hands on team, but lack of speed keeps him from challenging for 
more playing time. Opened last season as punt returner, but fizzled and spent 
remainder of year on practice squad. Works here as No. 5 receiver unless 
rookies struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blair Bush, 51 
</P>
<P>
 17th Year 
</P>
<P>
 Center 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 
</P>
<P>
 If Slater wasn't on this team, he'd be getting a lot of attention for having 
played 17 years. A top-notch center in his prime, he has taken the skill of 
deep snapping, which he learned in high school, and turned it into a career. 
Rams think he's best in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Chandler, 17 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh Year 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 
</P>
<P>
 Might be best backup in the game, and given Miller's track record, he's 
playing for the right team. Obviously, he hasn't been dealt a fair hand to 
date, playing for Indianapolis, Tampa Bay, Phoenix and now the Rams. Smelling 
salts, please, if he ever gets the chance to play for a winner. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Shane Conlan, 56 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth Year 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State 
</P>
<P>
 Walks like he has a broken leg, but put him on field and he has remarkable 
speed while chasing down running backs. Solid performer who has experience in 
big games. If front four stays healthy, blockers don't get near Conlan and he's 
free to lead team in tackles. Key performer for this defense. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dexter Davis, 29 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth Year 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback 
</P>
<P>
 Clemson 
</P>
<P>
 Started four games after being released by Phoenix. Won't get playing time 
this year unless Lyght and Israel are kidnapped. Coaches understandably 
paranoid about cornerback situation after signing guys off street last year to 
replace injured players. Most teams carry one less corner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Drayton, 84 
</P>
<P>
 Second Year 
</P>
<P>
 Tight End 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago they didn't think he was smart enough to grasp the Ram offense. How 
dumb was that? He might very well be the team's No. 1 receiver this year. 
Cornerbacks around the league are going to be yelling for help if caught in the 
open field with this moving mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 D'Marco Farr, 75 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive Tackle 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Keith Loneker, the rookie free agent who beat all odds to secure a 
roster spot. Coaches like these kind of tough guys who won't quit. Will never 
challenge Jones and Gilbert for playing time, but will add size and enthusiasm 
to special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gandy, 70 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive Tackle 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn 
</P>
<P>
 He looks like a guard, and that's not good, because he's supposed to be a 
tackle and he's the team's No. 1 draft pick. To date he has been overmatched at 
tackle. His best football might be two or three years down the road, which 
might be too late to help Coach Chuck Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Gilbert, 90 
</P>
<P>
 Third Year 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive Tackle 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 
</P>
<P>
 Watch this guy practice and it's no wonder he's the best player on the team. 
Down with an ankle injury recently, Gilbert sat on a cart trying to figure out 
the best way to force someone to fumble. He never quits, always gets 
double-teamed and still managed 10 1/2 sacks last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Goeas, 79 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth Year 
</P>
<P>
 Guard/Tackle 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii 
</P>
<P>
 Rams wanted Mike Zandofsky a year ago, but settled for Goeas, who went on to 
play beyond expectations as starting right guard. Chargers would love to have 
him back now. Started slowly in exhibition season, but that's his track record. 
Has skill to play tackle, too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Griffith, 30 
</P>
<P>
 Second Year 
</P>
<P>
 Running Back 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois 
</P>
<P>
 Played in 15 games as a special teams performer. If you're a running back and 
you're playing for the Rams, you're best chance of playing is on special teams 
unless Bettis goes AWOL. Coaches like him, but they also like Lang, Gary, 
Bailey and Lester. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wymon Henderson, 24 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth Year 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada Las Vegas 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young ripped Henderson & Co. for 482 yards, but instead of releasing 
Henderson, team provided full-time employment. Henderson looked like odd man 
out in camp, but Terry Taylor's failure to make good showing opened spot. 
Special teams showing also boosted Henderson's stock. 
</P>

<P>
 Jessie Hester, 86 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth Year 
</P>
<P>
 Wide Receiver 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State 
</P>
<P>
 Disappeared and looked like a big disappointment early on in training camp, 
but replaced Nate Lewis as starter in late going. First-round pick of Raiders 
in 1985. Caught 64 passes with Indianapolis last season. Will be 
pressed/replaced eventually by rookies Isaac Bruce and Chris Brantley. 
</P>

 Thomas Homco, 57 
</P>
<P>
 Second Year 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern 
</P>
<P>
 Increased emphasis on special teams this season by Rams improves his value. 
Lacks the size and speed make him an every-down performer, but smarts and 
dependability keep him as backup to Shane Conlan. Started for Conlan in 27-0 
victory over Steelers. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Steve Israel, 31 
</P>
<P>
 Third Year 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Henley's legal problems give him chance to start. Came on strong last 
season as one of team's most improved players. Led team with a dozen tipped 
passes, but failed to intercept a pass. Like Lyght, however, exhibition-season 
play has been less than impressive. 
</P>
<P>

 Clarence Jones, 72 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth Year 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive Tackle 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland 
</P>
<P>
 After tryout during off-season Rams lost interest, but once Giants made it 
known they weren't going to re-sign him, Rams took chance. Now he looks like 
team's starting left tackle after failure by rookie Wayne Gandy to hold his 
ground. In three years with Giants, he never started a game. 
</P>
<P>

 Jimmie Jones, 98 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth Year 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive Tackle 
</P>
<P>
 Miami (Fla.) 
</P>
<P>
 Will need a ticket to see the Super Bowl this year after playing in it the 
past two seasons. Knocked in Dallas for taking it easy at times, but playing 
alongside Sean Gilbert should keep him pumped up. Gilbert-Jones tandem should 
shut down opposition's running game. 
</P>

 Joe Kelly, 52 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth Year 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 
</P>
<P>
 Started at middle linebacker for Raiders, but gets assignment on outside with 
Rams. Was 11th player selected in 1986 draft by Cincinnati. Has 81 career 
starts and he contends he's as good as any linebacker in the game. But can he 
beat out Rolling? Coach Chuck Knox likes these kind of vets. 
</P>

 Todd Kinchen, 81 
</P>
<P>
 Third Year 
</P>
<P>
 Wide Receiver 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana State 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best after catching the ball, but to catch the ball he has to 
remain healthy. Missed 11 games last year with knee injury suffered while 
playing basketball in off-season. Still looks like he's bothered by that knee, 
and appears slower. Might need time before helping much.

 10th Year

 Punter

<P>
 Towson State 
</P>
<P>
 Remember last year? Don Bracken? Paul McJulien? What an improvement. His 
43.5-yard average was all right, and he was coming off a knee injury. Needs 
work on dropping the ball inside the 20, but veteran provides consistency and 
stability here.

 David Lang, 38 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth Year 
</P>
<P>
 Running Back 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Arizona 
</P>
<P>
 Most explosive back from line of scrimmage, but can he stay healthy? Knee 
injury in training camp last year has kept him from becoming big-time 
contributor. One of hardest workers on team, who deserves better luck. Has zip 
to become primary kick returner. 
</P>

 Tim Lester, 34 
</P>
<P>
 Third Year 
</P>
<P>
 Running Back 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Kentucky 
</P>
<P>
 Most underrated player on roster, but who is going to notice the guy who 
blocks for Bettis? Bettis! Bettis took him to Pro Bowl in Honolulu last year; 
that's what he thinks of him. Lester played in 16 games last season and carried 
the ball 11 times.

 Keith Loneker, 64 
</P>
<P>
 Second Year 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive Guard 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas 
</P>
<P>
 Nicknamed, "The House," as in White House. Beat the odds and made it last year 
and even started, but team remains disappointed in his failure to manage his 
weight. Plays right side as backup to Goeas; never received consideration when 
team went looking for left guard.

 Todd Lyght, 41 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth Year 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame 
</P>
<P>
 Improvement was obvious last season until knee injury took him out of final 
seven games. Had look of Pro Bowl performer, but regressed in exhibition 
season. Was beaten badly by Green Bay and New England and has begun playing way 
off receivers. Rams can't afford such a dropoff here.

<P>
 Rookie

<P>
 Safety 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia 
</P>
<P>
 Heir apparent to Newman. So far, he's been the best player to emerge from this 
year's draft, and he was selected in the third round. Father, Gary, played for 
Bears from 1968 to 1974. Will get work on special teams while taking reps in 
practice at free safety.

 Tommy Maddox, 8 
</P>
<P>
 Third Year 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA 
</P>
<P>
 Broncos thought he was lazy, lacked heart, but Rams believe they have steal in 
23-year-old quarterback. Maddox looks the part, but so did Jim Everett. Obvious 
upgrade from Jamie Martin, whom they released to make room for Maddox on the 
roster. Will start season as No. 3 quarterback.

</P>
<P>
 12th Year 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn 
</P>
<P>
 Playing behind Kelly and Rolling, but coaches love him because of his 
willingness to play special teams and because of his practice attitude. He is 
beginning his 12th year in the league, however, and team will eventually be 
looking to fill his spot with younger players. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Ron Middleton, 87 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth YearTight EndAuburn Redskins released him on cut to 60, but that was in 
part to change in offensive philosophy. He will play tight end for Rams, but 
will be asked assume role of a tackle and clear the way for tailback Jerome 
Bettis. A backup to Troy Drayton, Middleton won't catch a pass this year.

 Quarterback

 Oregon 
</P>
<P>
 Considered one of the game's most accurate passers, and is especially adept at 
throwing the deep ball. Hasn't played in a regular-season game since September; 
has had surgery on left knee twice. Has commanded respect of his teammates and 
gives Rams great hope for success if he stays healthy.

<P>
 Wisconsin LaCrosse 
</P>
<P>
 Stock inexplicably dropped after missing seven games with knee injury. Team 
decided to replace him as starter during off-season, and eventually moved 
Schultz into his spot. Guaranteed contract forces team to keep him. As a 
result, he will be asked to play center again in backup role.

 Emotional team leader who needs to make more big plays. Went through last 
season without getting an interception. Picked off errant Jeff Hostetler pass 
in exhibition season, which has to bolster his confidence. Finished fifth on 
team in tackles after starting every game at free safety.

 One day will probably start at defensive end for Rams, but that day will not 
come soon. Second-round pick never got untracked in training camp, and after 
injuries to Stokes and Robinson, team turned to overmatched rookie linebacker 
Ernest Jones before Ottis.

last season, but who noticed? Roman Zubinski Phifer, under the tutelage of 
linebacker coach Dick Selcer has become a bona fide big-time player. Had a 
dozen solo tackles against Washington last year.

 Came into the league as No. 1 draft pick, but has failed to live up to

 Nice guy who remains missing in action once regular season begins. Played well

 Remains a mystery. Chargers didn't want him, but Rams couldn't wait to insert

RAMS '94 / SEASON PREVIEW; BETTIS PLANNING TO EXTEND HIMSELF TO THE OUTER 
LIMITS; GROUND GAME: TAILBACK WANTS TO REACH THE RAREFIED AIR OF RUSHING FOR 
2,000 YARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram tailback Jerome Bettis had just learned to walk when O.J. Simpson became 
the NFL's first 2,000-yard rusher in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Rams' Eric Dickerson rushed for 2,105 yards in 1984, 
surpassing Simpson's mark of 2,003 yards, Bettis was still tearing up the 
playgrounds back in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis didn't see Simpson's or Dickerson's record-breaking seasons. But the 
statistics sit there in the record book, a constant reminder that has teased 
Bettis into wanting to join them. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Bettis has come of age, so have NFL offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 During training camp, Bettis, wearing a T-shirt reading "Limits are made to be 
broken," announced his goal this season of becoming the third back in NFL 
history to gain 2,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But can he do it in this day and age of high-tech passing offenses? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not impossible" Bettis said, "I think it's going to be done. When O.J. 
did it, they never thought it would be done again, but Dickerson did. I think 
it's just a matter of time before someone does it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis appears to be in the right offensive scheme to have a shot. As the 
centerpiece of Coach Chuck Knox's conservative rushing game in last year's 5-11 
season, Bettis rushed for 1,429 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis argues that running wins football games, but a 2,000-yard rusher has 
yet to lead a team to a playoff victory, let alone a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were 10-6 in Dickerson's record season, but were eliminated in the 
NFC wild-card game. Buffalo was 9-5 with Simpson in 1973 but didn't make the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to throw," said former San Francisco Coach Bill Walsh. "The 
low-scoring games emphasizing the run aren't going to take you all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh should know, having coached the 49ers to three Super Bowl titles in the 
1980s with a passing offense built around quarterback Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the 49ers had running backs Roger Craig and Tom Rathman, but when the 
49ers were in the two-minute drill, it was Montana to Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to the running game is short-yardage, on the goal line and the fourth 
quarter when you have the lead," Walsh said. "That's what we did so well with 
the 49ers. We controlled the ball with the short pass and run, and set up the 
big play to Rice or John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "From there, you have to make a big play on the running game, something like 
Bettis breaking for 20 yards. The three- and four-yard running game isn't going 
to make you a winner, it takes too long to score that way. And too many things 
can go wrong with too many plays in a drive." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Washington Coach Joe Gibbs won three Super Bowls with a running game 
that featured Joe Washington, John Riggins and Ernest Byner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins' rushing game opened up passing for quarterbacks Joe Theismann, 
Doug Williams and Mark Rypien. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't run the ball," Gibbs said, "you're not going anywhere. All the 
good ones run, and Chuck has always put together a good rushing game." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis' rushing total last year is the second-highest total ever in a Knox 
offense. He didn't become the team's full-time starter until the sixth game of 
the season, and he averaged 131 yards in the final six games of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're coming off a year where we had difficulties at the quarterback spot 
(with Jim Everett)," Bettis said. "But it's feasible for us to do it this year 
because we're a little hesitant to throw it 30 or 40 times a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll want to ease into it. It's going to give me a chance to go out there 
early and get some things done." 
</P>
<P>
 But the jury is still out on whether Knox's offense is effective or 
antiquated. In other words, have the high-tech offenses of today passed by 
Ground Chuck? 
</P>
<P>
 To wit: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Knox-coached teams have qualified for the playoffs only six times in the 
last 16 years, the last time in 1988, when his Seattle Seahawks were 9-7 and 
won the AFC West. He hasn't had a winning season since 1990, when the Seahawks 
were 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One of Knox's best teams was his 1984 Seattle Seahawks, who went 12-4 and 
won the AFC West despite losing Curt Warner to injury. Fullback David Hughes 
led the team in rushing with only 327 yards in 94 carries that year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The most yards any back has gained in a Knox offense was 1,481 in 319 
carries by Warner in 1986, when the Seahawks went 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tailback Lawrence McCutcheon, the workhorse in Knox's Ram offenses, rushed 
for 1,000 yards or more four times between 1973 and '77, and the Rams won the 
NFC West division title each year. McCutcheon's best season was 1,238 yards in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game has tried to pass the running game by," Bettis said, "but every time 
it has tried to, it has been reminded that the running game is what takes you 
to the next level. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at it, what teams have been winning the Super Bowl? The NFC 
East, right? And what do NFC East teams do? Run the football. You have to 
realize that, and go out and use what the winners are using. And the running 
game is going to give you a better chance at winning the Super Bowl than just 
passing it." 
</P>
<P>
 True, the Rams' offense has been redesigned this year under new offensive 
coordinator Chick Harris. Using a system somewhat similar to what Dallas and 
San Francisco run, the offense is designed to pound Bettis inside and spring 
him free on sweeps, then use him as a decoy to open up quarterback Chris 
Miller's passing game. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Rams are trailing in the second half, where will Bettis be? Running 
play-action or standing on the sidelines watching as Miller throws to try to 
catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Miller thinks Bettis' goal might be out of reach.  
</P>
<P>
 "That will be awfully tough," he said. "I know Jerome has set a high goal, 
that's awfully difficult. If a guy can get it, I guess that means you're ahead 
in most games and we would be pounding the ball and running the clock." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams went 0-4 in the exhibition season and are still waiting for Miller to 
throw a touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Bettis' key blockers, tight end Pat Carter, signed with the Houston 
Oilers in the off-season. The Rams had to scramble this week to find a 
run-blocking tight end in free agent Ron Middleton to back up starter Troy 
Drayton, who is nowhere near the blocker Carter was. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Carter, coupled with a shaky offensive line, appears to have 
Bettis' goal on slippery footing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a goal" he said, "but I won't live and die by it." A Clean Sweep 
</P>
<P>
 Ram tailback Jerome Bettis finished his rookie season in 1993 with 1,429 
yards, many of them on this sweep play. During the last seven weeks of the 
season, the Rams ran 36 sweeps for 318 yards, an average of 8.8 yards per 
carry. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Rams line up with tight end on right side (strong right). 
</P>
<P>
 2. Guards pull; left guard blocks middle linebacker, right guard helps tight 
end with strong side linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Fullback is lead blocker, takes out strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Tailback takes ball from quarterback, cuts upfield between safety and 
cornerback.

RAMS '94 / SEASON PREVIEW; RAM COACHING STAFF: A NEW LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY and Warren Simmons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox hired three new assistant coaches and promoted three others 
in the off-season. A look at the newcomers and staff members in new positions: 
Steve Moore, Receivers 
</P>
<P>
 Career: Moore, 46, has held various offensive coaching positions on Knox's 
Buffalo and Seattle staffs. He coached Seattle's receivers from 1983-85 before 
becoming the team's offensive coordinator in 1986. A graduate of UC Santa 
Barbara, Moore coached high school football in Texas before taking assistant 
positions at Army, and Rice. His first NFL job was as Buffalo's special teams 
and offensive special assignments in 1978. Moore, who has been out of coaching 
since 1989, replaces Milt Jackson, who left in February to become Atlanta's 
receivers coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches who have influenced Moore: "I started with Chuck Knox when I was 30 
years old, so he obviously has had a huge impact on me. And I've studied Bill 
Walsh's work, and he was a strong influence too." 
</P>
<P>
 Top players coached: In Seattle, wide receiver Steve Largent, running back 
Curt Warner and safety Kenny Easley. 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: During his five years out of football, Moore did strategic and 
operational planning for companies, primarily banks. He helped companies 
develop a game-plan through self-evaluation and studying the competition, much 
like his duties as a football coach. "The parallels between the two are 
several," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Season outlook: "We're going to have a special year. I think Chris Miller is 
an incredible addition to the program, not only his athletic ability but his 
people skills. I think everything on offense will come together -- Chris, 
Jerome Bettis, a revitalized Willie Anderson and an improved offensive line." 
Wayne Sevier, Special Teams 
</P>
<P>
 Career: Sevier, 53, has the task of improving the Rams' special teams, which 
were ranked last in the NFL in several categories last season. Considered one 
of the best special teams coaches in the league, Sevier coached in three Super 
Bowls with the Washington Redskins. He also has coached with St. Louis, Atlanta 
and San Diego. Sevier replaces Howard Tippett, who resigned after last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches who influenced Sevier: "The most obvious is Don Coryell, who 
influenced Joe Gibbs, myself, and everybody who played for him. And Gibbs has 
been a great influence too. He's a future Hall of Famer, a guy who understands 
the whole package." 
</P>
<P>
 Top NFL players coached: Punter -- Reggie Roby. Kickers -- Jim Bakken, St. 
Louis Rolf Benirschke in San Diego, Chip Lohmiller and Mark Moseley in 
Washington. Return men -- Terry Metcalf in St. Louis, and Darrell Green and 
Brian Mitchell in Washington. Other special teams players -- San Diego's Hank 
Bauer and Washington's Danny Copeland. 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: Sevier was quarterback on Don Coryell's San Diego State teams in 1961 and 
'62. 
</P>
<P>
 Career in quotes: "I can't think of anything like that. But we're going to 
shock the NFL this season with our special teams. Nobody has any idea what is 
going to happen." Warren Simmons, Tight Ends 
</P>
<P>
 Career: Simmons, 53, has coached tight ends, the offensive line and wide 
receivers during 12 seasons with the Washington Redskins, who won three Super 
Bowls in that stretch. He played center at San Diego State with Ram special 
teams coach Wayne Sevier before coaching at Cal State Fullerton (1974-78) and 
Cerritos College (1978-80). 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches who influenced Simmons: "It all starts with Don Coryell at San Diego 
State. Also Wally Kincaid, the baseball and football coach at Cerritos, and the 
late Dallas Moon at Cal State Fullerton, and Joe Gibbs at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Top NFL players coached: In Washington, Clint Didier, Art Monk, Ron Middleton, 
Terry Orr, Ricky Sanders and Don Warren. 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: Simmons attended Santa Fe Springs High with former Redskin Coach Joe 
Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Career in quotes: "I feel very fortunate to have coached so many years under 
Joe. I can remember we went 0-5 in our first year there. Nobody handed us 
anything. We earned it." MIKE REILLEY Warren Simmons

RAMS '94 / SEASON PREVIEW; THE RAMS' 1994 OPPONENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ARIZONA CARDINALS 
</P>
<P>
 SEPT. 4, SUNDAY, 1 P.M., ANAHEIM STADIUM 
</P>
<P>
 LAST YEAR: ARIZONA 38, RAMS 10 
</P>
<P>
 THE SERIES: RAMS LEAD, 23-19-2 
</P>
<P>
 1993 RECORD: 7-9 
</P>
<P>
 KEY OFFENSIVE STARTERS: Running back Ron Moore was a surprise. He stepped in 
for the injured Garrison Hearst and gained 1,018 yards. Steve Beuerlein came 
over from Dallas and, once out of Troy Aikman's shadow, did fine. He threw for 
3,164 yards and 18 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY DEFENSIVE STARTERS: Buddy Ryan's "46 defense" has some familiar faces. 
Former Philadelphia Eagles Clyde Simmons and Seth Joyner came over and should 
anchor the front. Joyner is considered one of the league's linebackers. Rookie 
Jamir Miller should find something to do. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RAMS COULD DO WITHOUT: More punishment from a Buddy Ryan defense. Simmons 
and Joyner could chew up quarterback Chris Miller and his fragile knee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ATLANTA FALCONS 
</P>
<P>
 SEPT. 11, SUNDAY, 10 A.M., GEORGIA DOME, ATLANTA 
</P>
<P>
 OCT. 2, SUNDAY, 1 P.M., ANAHEIM STADIUM 
</P>
<P>
 LAST YEAR: ATLANTA 30, RAMS 24; ATLANTA 13, RAMS 0 
</P>
<P>
 THE SERIES: RAMS LEAD, 36-16-2 
</P>
<P>
 1993 RECORD: 6-10 
</P>
<P>
 KEY OFFENSIVE STARTERS: Jeff George comes over from Indianapolis. He has to 
throw to Andre Rison (86 receptions and 15 touchdowns), who was traded to 
Atlanta in a deal that gave the Colts the rights to George. Erric Pegram gained 
1,185 yards in the "run" part of the run-and-shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY DEFENSIVE STARTERS: Defensive end Chris Doleman was acquired from the 
Minnesota Vikings. He and Pierce Holt should improve on the Falcons' 26 sacks. 
Atlanta had 13 interceptions, but seven were by Deion Sanders. Neon's gone. 
D.J. Johnson and Kevin Ross will try to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RAMS COULD DO WITHOUT: George and Rison playing a leisurely game of catch. 
Rison had three touchdown receptions in the sweep of the Rams last season and 
that was with Billy Joe Tolliver and Bobby Herbert as QBs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS 
</P>
<P>
 SEPT. 18, SUNDAY, 1 P.M., ANAHEIM STADIUM 
</P>
<P>
 NOV. 20, SUNDAY, 5 P.M., CANDLESTICK PARK, SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
<P>
 LAST YEAR: SAN FRANCISCO 40, RAMS 17; SAN FRANCISCO 35, RAMS 10 
</P>
<P>
 THE SERIES: RAMS LEAD, 48-39-2 
</P>
<P>
 1993 RECORD: 10-6 
</P>
<P>
 KEY OFFENSIVE STARTERS: Steve Young is in his prime and still hungry to make 
people forget that Montana guy. Receivers Jerry Rice and John Taylor are as 
sensational as always. Ricky Watters will have a new lead blocker in Florida 
State fullback William Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY DEFENSIVE STARTERS: Lots of new faces. Linebackers Ken Norton (Dallas) and 
Gary Plummer (San Diego), Rickey Jackson (New Orleans) and defensive end 
Richard Dent (Chicago) will make an impact. Safety Tim McDonald leads a 
revamped secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RAMS COULD DO WITHOUT: Get serious. Rams could do without playing the 
49ers at all. They have lost seven straight and nine of last 10. They weren't 
even close last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 KANSAS CITY CHIEFS 
</P>
<P>
 SEPT. 25, SUNDAY, 10 A.M., ARROWHEAD STADIUM, KANSAS CITY 
</P>
<P>
 LAST MEETING: 1991, KANSAS CITY 27, RAMS 20 
</P>
<P>
 THE SERIES: RAMS LEAD, 3-1 
</P>
<P>
 1993 RECORD: 11-5 
</P>
<P>
 KEY OFFENSIVE STARTERS: As Joe goes, so go the Chiefs. A healthy Montana got 
the Chiefs to the AFC title game. Montana clone Steve Bono was acquired in case 
Montana doesn't stay healthy. Marcus Allen got away from Al Davis and helped 
beat the Raiders twice. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY DEFENSIVE STARTERS: Neil Smith and Derrick Thomas give the Chiefs a fierce 
rush from the outside. Defensive tackle Tony Casillas, a free agent from 
Dallas, should strengthen the inside. Cornerback Mark Collins, another free 
agent, should ease the loss of Albert Lewis and Kevin Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RAMS COULD DO WITHOUT: A vintage Montana performance. He threw 34 
touchdown passes and had six 300-yard games against them while with the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 GREEN BAY PACKERS 
</P>
<P>
 OCT. 9, SUNDAY, 10 A.M., LAMBEAU FIELD, GREEN BAY 
</P>
<P>
 LAST YEAR: GREEN BAY 36, RAMS 6 
</P>
<P>
 THE SERIES: RAMS LEAD, 42-37-2 
</P>
<P>
 1993 RECORD: 9-7 
</P>
<P>
 KEY OFFENSIVE STARTERS: Wide receiver Sterling Sharpe broke his own record 
with 112 receptions last season. Brett Favre is erratic, but can be dangerous. 
No Packer running back has gained 1,000 yards since 1978. So they signed Reggie 
Cobb, who gained 1,171 with Tampa Bay in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY DEFENSIVE STARTERS: Defensive end Reggie White can dominate a game. He had 
13 sacks last season. That pass rush gets better with the addition of Sean 
Jones, a free agent from Houston. Terrell Buckley, LeRoy Butler and George 
Teague give the Packers a solid secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RAMS COULD DO WITHOUT: White and Jones using Miller as a wishbone. Favre 
having another hot day -- he threw for 264 yards and two touchdowns against 
them last season. 
</P>
<P>

 NEW YORK GIANTS 
</P>
<P>
 OCT. 16, SUNDAY, 1 P.M., ANAHEIM STADIUM

 LAST YEAR: NEW YORK 20, RAMS 10

<P>
 THE SERIES: RAMS LEAD, 21-10

 KEY OFFENSIVE STARTERS: Phil Simms, victim of the salary cap or worn-out 
veteran? Either way, Dave Brown is the quarterback, but whether he is on Oct. 
16 is the question. He has thrown only seven passes in his career. Running back 
Rodney Hampton could be relied on even more. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY DEFENSIVE STARTERS: The front seven is strong, but they lost three of four 
starters in the secondary. Lawrence Taylor retired, but linebackers Corey 
Miller, Michael Brooks and Carlton Bailey are strong. Defensive end Keith 
Hamilton had 11.5 sacks last season. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RAMS COULD DO WITHOUT: Hampton dominating the game. He gained 134 yards in 
41 carries and scored one touchdown in a 20-10 victory last season.

 THE SERIES: RAMS LEAD, 27-21

 1993 RECORD: 8-8 
</P>
<P>
 KEY OFFENSIVE STARTERS: The name Jim Everett ring a bell? He was run out of 
Anaheim and is now supposed to take the Saints to the Super Bowl. They also 
signed wide receiver Michael Haynes. A good group of young running backs in 
Derek Brown, Vaughn Dunbar, Lorenzo Neal and Mario Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY DEFENSIVE STARTERS: Renaldo Turnbull is the best of a good, but aging 
linebacker group. Linebacker Vaughan Johnson and defensive linemen Robert Goff 
and Jim Wilks are good, but getting old. Rookie Joe Johnson and Winfred Tubbs 
are waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RAMS COULD DO WITHOUT: Everett's revenge. It would be a perfect script for 
Everett to turn back time and clean the Rams' clock. He gets two shots at it.

</P>
<P>
 THE SERIES: TIED, 3-3 
</P>
<P>
 1993 RECORD: 9-7 
</P>
<P>
 KEY OFFENSIVE STARTERS: John Elway, of course. Still good at 34, he now has 
two speedy receivers to throw to in Anthony Miller (San Diego) and Mike 
Pritchard (Atlanta), who will take pressure off Shannon Sharpe. Running back 
Glyn Milburn does a lot of things, some of them well, but the Broncos still 
signed free-agent Leonard Russell during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY DEFENSIVE STARTERS: Cornerback Ray Crockett, a free agent from Detroit, 
will try to improve the Broncos' coverage, hurt by the loss of Dennis Smith. 
Linebacker Simon Fletcher had 13.5 sacks last season. Linebacker Mike Croel and 
defensive end Shane Dronett are improving. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RAMS COULD DO WITHOUT: A vintage Elway performance. Like Montana, he has 
carved the Rams before. In 1988, he threw for 272 yards and three touchdowns.

</P>
<P>
 THE SERIES: RAIDERS LEAD, 5-2 
</P>
<P>
 1993 RECORD: 10-6 
</P>
<P>
 KEY OFFENSIVE STARTERS: Quarterback Jeff Hostetler throws them and a plethora 
of speedy receivers catch them. When Tim Brown (80 receptions, 1,180 yards) is 
your slowest wide receiver, you got something good. James Jett, Alvin Wright 
and Raghib "Rocket" Ismail can burn any defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY DEFENSIVE STARTERS: Anthony Smith and Chester McGlockton are formidable up 
front. Terry McDaniel is among the league's best cornerbacks. Albert Lewis, a 
free agent from Kansas City, strengthens the secondary. Rookie linebacker Rob 
Fredrickson could make an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RAMS COULD DO WITHOUT: A repeat of the exhibition game. The Raiders 
stomped all over the Rams at Anaheim. Their fans were even more vicious.

<P>
 THE SERIES: RAMS LEAD, 3-2 
</P>
<P>
 1993 RECORD: 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY OFFENSIVE STARTERS: A good group of running backs in Natrone Means, Ronnie 
Harmon and Eric Bienemy. Stan Humphries has been good, but was hurt part of 
last season Will Tony Martin (Miami) be able to fill that gaping hole left by 
Anthony Miller, now with the Broncos?. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY DEFENSIVE STARTERS: There are few better than linebacker Junior Seau. 
Dennis Gibson, a free agent from Detroit, has been brought in to replace Gary 
Plummer, who signed with San Francisco. That's a push. Leslie O'Neal gets to 
the quarterback enough to be a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RAMS COULD DO WITHOUT: Being swept by California teams. With the 49ers and 
Raiders certain defeats, beating the Chargers is the Rams' only chance.

</P>
<P>
 THE SERIES: RAMS LEAD, 9-2 
</P>
<P>
 1993 RECORD: 5-11. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY OFFENSIVE STARTERS: Craig Erickson is the quarterback, at least until No. 
1 draft pick Trent Dilfer is ready. But Dilfer isn't being paid to sit. Not 
much else. Tim Irwin, a free agent from Minnesota, is a solid tackle. Jackie 
Harris, a free agent from Green Bay, is a solid tight end. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY DEFENSIVE STARTERS: The best are mostly free agents. Linebacker Lonnie 
Marts came from Kansas City and safety Thomas Everett from Dallas. Defensive 
ends Eric Curry and Santana Dotson each had five sacks, but that's not going to 
frighten many quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RAMS COULD DO WITHOUT: Trent Dilfer showing them up. They traded down in 
the draft to get away from him. They don't need him beating them.

</P>
<P>
 THE SERIES: CHICAGO LEADS, 45-30-3 
</P>
<P>
 1993 RECORD: 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY OFFENSIVE STARTERS: Erik Kramer is now the quarterback, replacing Jim 
Harbaugh. Will anyone be able to tell them apart? Running backs Lewis Tillman 
and Merril Hoge were brought in to juice up a running game that lost Neil 
Anderson to retirement. People will notice the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY DEFENSIVE STARTERS: Richard Dent is gone. So is Steve McMichael. But still 
a solid defense. Chris Zorich and Trace Armstrong anchor the defensive line. 
Mark Carrier and Donnell Woolford are dangerous in the secondary. First-round 
pick John Thierry could replace Dent. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RAMS COULD DO WITHOUT: Bad weather. It's December. It's Chicago. The Rams 
could win this one, but not if it snows. They're never done well when you can 
see their breath.

</P>
<P>
 THE SERIES: WASHINGTON LEADS, 16-7-2 1993 RECORD: 4-12 
</P>
<P>
 KEY OFFENSIVE STARTERS: Quarterback Heath Shuler, the first quarterback taken 
in the draft, could be acclimated to the NFL by the final game. Henry Ellard 
could be the second ex-Ram to haunt his teammates. The bright spot for the 
Redskins' offense last season was running back Reggie Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY OFFENSIVE STARTERS: Not the defense it once was, but on the mend. 
Cornerback Tom Carter had six interceptions. Linebacker Ken Harvey, a free 
agent from Arizona, had 9.5 sacks a year ago. Linebacker Andre Collins is still 
solid, but the defense has a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RAMS COULD DO WITHOUT: Losing their last game in Anaheim Stadium, as they 
did in 1979 in their last game in the Coliseum. Another finale flop would be a 
fitting farewell.

<P>
 This former Sea View League member receives a boost from two former players. 
The Roadrunners' attack revolves around Caldwell, who returns to the team after 
living in Texas in 1993. As a starter on the varsity in 1992, Caldwell gained 
507 yards in 94 carries (a 5.4-yard average) and scored two touchdowns. "He's 
the only speed we have on the football field," Witte said. "We need 1,000 yards 
from him and we think we can get it." Killingbeck returns after taking a year 
off to concentrate on baseball and basketball. He started at cornerback toward 
the end of his sophomore season, but will play offense exclusively. Witte is 
relying on Killingbeck to operate the Roadrunners' option attack. "We're very 
pleased to have them back," Witte said. "We need them." SCHEDULE

 The Sunset League was not kind to Westminster. Like many of the new league's 
arrivals, the Lions are hoping for better days. They might get their wish 
immediately. Westminster has experience and depth. "We have a lot more (depth) 
than in some previous years," Clark said. "We have a lot of solid players. We 
like our chances." Allison and Vit split time at quarterback last season and 
are again battling for the job. "I'm real pleased with the contest," Clark 
said. "They both have been working a little harder." Another heated competition 
is occurring at tight end. Mann and Tafua have both been impressive, which 
might force Clark to rotate them and devise plays using two tight ends.

 Hinman's first two seasons were less than stellar. He's hoping the Saints' 
fortune will change with the move from the Sunset League. Several good battles 
for positions are taking place. "We'd have to flip coins in a lot of spots if 
the season started today," Hinman said. "We've got a lot of things that are 
still undecided." Martinez and Schwalm each have shown leadership ability in 
the quarterback competition. Cabrera and Esparza have similar running styles. 
They are quick and can catch passes coming out of the backfield. Avila and 
Sagrero possess speed and usually catch most passes thrown in their direction. 
Size and strength along the offensive line might be a source of problems.

 After struggling through some rough seasons in the Sea View League, Tustin has 
a good chance to qualify for the playoffs in the new league's first season. 
Ellis begins his second season in control of the Tillers with lots of talent on 
offense. Timone gained valuable experience as the backup quarterback last 
season and is prepared to take over the lead role, Ellis said. Timone has a 
strong arm and good instincts. "We've got experience at quarterback," Ellis 
said. "That's one of our strengths." Tustin's receivers are another source of 
strength. Roberts and Curry are fast and make the big catches. Wilson provides 
Timone with a big target for tough, short-yardage receptions. Many of the 
offensive linemen are varsity newcomers, but the group shows promise. Staubly 
and Ray are big and physical. Wilson and Stadler should anchor the Tillers' 
defense. They are strong and quick. SCHEDULE

<P>
 In responding to a preseason questionnaire, Donnelly listed winning five games 
as the Seahawks' team goal. While that might seem unambitious to some, five 
victories in a season at Ocean View is like snow in the Southland--it don't 
happen often. If the Seahawks attain their goal, it would give them five more 
victories than they've had the last three seasons combined. Ocean View, which 
finished last in the Sunset League last season, has lost 29 consecutive games. 
Entering a new league might be just the thing to spark a turnaround; Donnelly 
sure hopes so. "I think we're a lot better than last year," Donnelly said. "I 
think we're going to get a few (victories)." If so, Silva must come through 
with a standout season. Silva, a member of the varsity for three seasons and a 
two-year starter, is a powerful runner who is also capable of big plays. 
Helping Silva break free is Traxler's job. SCHEDULE

 This is the Golden West League's inaugural season. Ocean View, Santa Ana, 
Servite and Westminster move from the Sunset League, and Saddleback and Tustin 
arrive from the Sea View League.None of the teams qualified for the Southern 
Section playoffs last season. Santa Ana senior quarterback Mark Fausto passed 
for 2,064 yards with 13 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He also led the team 
in rushing with 334 yards and three touchdowns. Tustin senior running back 
Lamar Barrett rushed for 663 yards with eight touchdowns. He averaged 6.4 yards 
per carry. Westminster scored its most points of the season in a 43-29 Sunset 
League victory over Santa Ana on Oct. 22. Servite, which lost five of its first 
six games, won two of its last four. The Friars (3-7, 3-4 in Sunset League 
play) were fifth in league, the highest finish among teams in the Golden West 
League. Ocean View came close to ending its losing streak, which reached 29 
games at the end of the 1993 season, on Oct. 22. The Seahawks lost to Servite, 
14-12, in a Sunset League game.
