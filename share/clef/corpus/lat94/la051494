CLINTON PICKS MODERATE JUDGE BREYER FOR SUPREME COURT SPOT; JUDICIARY: 
PRESIDENT SAYS THE SCHOLARLY NOMINEE HAS 'PROVEN THAT HE CAN BUILD AN EFFECTIVE 
CONSENSUS.' THE FEDERAL JURIST HAS WIDE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE SENATE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting candidates who appeared to be politically riskier, President Clinton 
on Friday chose federal Judge Stephen G. Breyer, a scholarly centrist jurist 
with bipartisan support, to fill his Administration's second vacancy on the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hastily convened press conference, Clinton hailed the 55-year-old Boston 
jurist as a candidate of "excellence," with a keen mind, a respect for civil 
rights and an ability to explain the laws to average Americans. He said that 
Breyer, who would replace retiring Justice Harry A. Blackmun if confirmed by 
the Senate, has "proven that he can build an effective consensus. . . . Without 
dispute, he is one of the outstanding jurists of our age." 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer has sat on the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston since 1980 
and was named chief judge in 1990. A runner-up in last year's Supreme Court 
search, Breyer earlier was chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
under Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Garden announcement ended a tortuous and increasingly fevered 37-day 
search in which Clinton apparently had been ready, in recent days, to choose 
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt or federal appeals Judge Richard S. Arnold of 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton said he "couldn't afford to lose" Babbitt from his sensitive 
Cabinet post. And, he said, he could not risk choosing his old Arkansas friend 
until questions about his nearly two-decade-old cancer were resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 With enthusiastic support from Republicans, Breyer's nomination is likely to 
sail through the Senate confirmation proceedings, sparing Clinton any 
distracting controversy as his health reform bill wends its way through 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But the selection leaves Clinton open to criticism that he yielded to pressure 
from Senate conservatives who had expressed unhappiness at the prospect that 
the more liberal Babbitt could be chosen. Indeed, some aides had been pushing 
Clinton to choose Babbitt and prove that he would not allow the opposition of 
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, or other conservative Republicans to influence his Supreme Court 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement brought plaudits from conservatives and hesitation from some 
liberals. Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), for example, called Breyer an 
"excellent choice," and he drew praise as well from Hatch and Sen. Alan K. 
Simpson (R-Wyo.), both Judiciary Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio, a liberal Democrat, said that he had 
concerns about Breyer's "moderate to conservative" record. "He's been more 
concerned about the situation of big business" and less about that of smaller 
companies and the less well off, Metzenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer is said to have given up a promising political career for a life on the 
bench. He has been described as skilled in forging consensus among his 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of his talents was the fact that he won over both the parties while 
he was majority counsel to the Judiciary Committee. Indeed, he was confirmed to 
the federal court after his sponsor, President Jimmy Carter, was defeated in 
1980, because he had become so well-liked by committee conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers who have worked with him in New England praise him as quick, scholarly 
and nonpartisan, if a bit imperious. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial disclosure forms show he is worth several million dollars in stocks 
and bonds. The Supreme Court annual salary is $164,100. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Breyer's legal credentials may be unassailable, he is not the 
nationally respected political figure that Clinton once said he wanted to 
appoint to ensure that social realities are represented on the court. Clinton's 
first choice last year for the previous court opening was New York Gov. Mario 
M. Cuomo, and this year he first sought Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell, who withdrew his name from consideration.  
</P>
<P>
 With a scholarly manner that Georgetown University law professor Paul 
Rothstein called "almost egghead," Breyer is probably not the person with a 
common touch and "big heart" that Clinton had said he was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 And, indeed, Breyer -- despite his impressive judicial credentials -- also may 
not be the major figure Clinton had sought -- one who would be immediately 
hailed by all sides as a towering addition to the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection also leaves Clinton vulnerable to criticism that he has 
disappointed minorities, and, in particular, Latinos, after raising hopes that 
one of their number might be chosen. Federal Judge Jose A. Cabranes of 
Connecticut was mentioned as a candidate during the search, but he faded from 
contention. Some liberal advocates have complained that the presence of his 
name was "window dressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's finalists were all white males from Harvard, a fact that will make 
it far harder for the diversity-conscious Clinton to choose anyone but a 
minority if he receives a third opportunity to name a justice. Some 
court-watchers believe that Justice John Paul Stevens may retire next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection also leaves Clinton vulnerable to criticism that in his 
deliberations on the court he treated other candidates poorly by raising 
expectations that they were about to be chosen. Such criticism was directed at 
Clinton last year when he passed over Breyer -- after a highly publicized Oval 
Office meeting -- in favor of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton seemed to be trying to prevent such criticism by lavishly praising 
Babbitt and Arnold in his Rose Garden press conference. As a former governor, 
Babbitt would bring to the court "the responsibility and discipline of service 
in public life," and a feel "for life at the grass roots." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited Arnold's reputation, noting that 100 federal judges, a full eighth of 
the federal bench, had written him to endorse Arnold's character. And he said 
that if he had another chance to select a Supreme Court justice "I will 
consider Judge Arnold at the top of the list." 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton increasingly focused on the issue this week, he first appeared to 
favor Babbitt, then Arnold but only on Friday -- within two hours of the 
announcement -- made up his mind to name Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Between Monday and Wednesday Clinton seemed ready to name Babbitt, and many 
White House aides were highly enthusiastic at the prospect of selecting the 
one-time presidential candidate. But at a meeting in the White House 
residential quarters, it became clear that "the President wasn't there," said 
one aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty took the President aside in a White House 
kitchen, and the pair decided to consider Arnold, an old friend and the 
President's "sentimental favorite." 
</P>
<P>
 But a review of the Senate revealed that the selection of Arnold would stir 
unhappiness among a number of women Democratic senators -- Dianne Feinstein and 
Barbara Boxer of California, Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland, Patty Murray of 
Washington and Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois. There also, of course, was the 
question of Arnold's cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, McLarty asked for additional reports on the prognosis for the 
cancer, for which Arnold is soon to receive additional treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision was made by the President at about 4 p.m. Friday, after he 
spent about half an hour reflecting by himself on the choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Clinton had met Breyer in the Oval Office, where, aides said later, 
the "chemistry" between the two had been bad. But aides told Clinton this year 
that the problem may have been only that Breyer was too ill from a long 
railroad trip from Boston and a punctured lung he had suffered in a bicycle 
accident, to give the meeting the required concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 After the decision Friday, Clinton called Breyer, who was "thrilled," 
according to an aide. Clinton suggested that Breyer visit the White House with 
his wife this weekend, telling him they could stay in the Lincoln Bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides acknowledged that there was some concern that a Babbitt confirmation 
proceeding "wouldn't be completely clean." But he insisted that that 
consideration was far less important than concerns that it would be hard to 
replace Babbitt at Interior, a post that Clinton considers key to his Western 
political strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The aide played down suggestions that the selection would draw criticism that 
Clinton was not willing to fight for what he wanted. "He's not afraid of a 
fight -- anyone who watched him on the (North American Free Trade Agreement) 
knows that," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6 p.m. Friday announcement came at a time Presidents usually reserve for 
information they wish to play down in the media. But the aide called this "pure 
happenstance." From Harvard to High Court Nominee 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen G. Breyer is a highly respected Boston jurist with a background in 
teaching. If confirmed, he will replace retiring Justice Harry A. Blackmun. 
Though Breyer is considered a moderate, it is unclear whether his opinions 
would lean toward the liberal or conservative side. PROFILE

U.S. SECRETLY PUSHES CHINA ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has launched a secret, intensive diplomatic 
campaign to get China to make more concessions on human rights in the final 
weeks before the U.S. deadline for deciding whether Beijing's trade privileges 
in this country should be renewed, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the Administration is now trying through secret negotiations to do 
what Secretary of State Warren Christopher was unable to do in Beijing last 
March -- to make the Chinese regime take seriously President Clinton's 
oft-repeated threats to curb China's trade benefits if it fails to take 
concrete steps to ease its repressive policies. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Administration officials have refused to confirm or deny 
reports that the President has dispatched a secret emissary to Beijing for 
talks with the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration must decide by June 3 whether to renew China's "most 
favored nation" trade benefits, which permit Chinese goods to be exported to 
the United States with the same low tariffs enjoyed by most other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to have any comment on any diplomacy that is going on," White 
House spokesman Tom Ross said Friday. Defending the secrecy, a senior 
Administration official said: "We're in the delicate last stages of this thing, 
and there's a fierce desire not to say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Two senior officials from the Jimmy Carter Administration, White House 
National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and Michel Oksenberg, 
Brzezinski's China expert on the National Security Council, are scheduled to 
land Monday in Beijing to take part in what is officially described as a 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Brzezinski and Oksenberg were in charge of the 1978 negotiations leading up to 
the establishment of diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 In resorting to secret diplomacy with Beijing, the Administration is following 
essentially the same path taken by former President George Bush, whom Clinton 
criticized in the 1992 campaign for "coddling dictators" in China. 
</P>
<P>
 In the six months after China's bloody 1989 crackdown, Bush twice dispatched 
Brent Scowcroft, his national security adviser, and Deputy Secretary of State 
Lawrence S. Eagleburger on secret missions to Beijing. Winston Lord, now 
Clinton's assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific, then 
denounced Bush for sending "fawning emissaries" to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an executive order issued by Clinton a year ago, China was supposed to 
make "overall significant progress" on human rights by this June if it wanted 
to get its trade benefits renewed for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, human rights groups and several Administration officials have 
acknowledged that China has not yet made this progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few months, the Beijing regime has appeared to take several 
steps backward by rearresting dissidents who had been freed, such as leading 
democracy activist Wei Jingsheng. But early today, China's official New China 
News Service said that prominent pro-democracy activist Chen Ziming has been 
freed, the Reuters news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. business groups worry that without new concessions from Beijing on human 
rights, the Administration will curb China's trade benefits, and Beijing will 
then retaliate against U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's immediate goal is to see if it can win enough changes 
from Beijing to be able to claim that there has been "significant progress." 
Among the possibilities would be a series of releases of prominent dissidents, 
a promise to end the jamming of Voice of America broadcasts or some new 
agreement on talks with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. 
</P>
<P>
 National Security Adviser Anthony Lake referred briefly to the new 
negotiations in a television interview Thursday when he acknowledged that after 
the Christopher trip, the Administration had decided to switch to quiet 
diplomacy with China. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way to work this through was to drain the venom out of that rhetoric 
(between China and the United States), which we have done over the last month 
or so, and to work it with them very hard and privately," Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake met at the White House Thursday with Wang Juntao, a pro-democracy 
activist just released from prison in China. In that session, Lake indicated 
that the Administration has obtained some new concessions from the Beijing 
government on human rights. But he did not say exactly what China had promised 
or when it would be made public. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Paal, who served as director of Asian affairs for Bush's National 
Security Council, said he had urged the appointment of a secret emissary to 
China a month ago but that Administration officials then were not receptive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was asked for my ideas after the Christopher fiasco," Paal said. "I 
suggested an emissary and I suggested some names, including Brzezinski and 
Oksenberg. I was told Clinton had ruled it out. But now they must be getting 
desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 One congressional Democrat observed Friday that if the Administration has 
resorted to special emissaries and secret negotiations with China, it would 
amount to "a statement that the normal institutions of diplomacy aren't 
working." 
</P>
<P>
 During Christopher's trip to Beijing last March, Chinese and U.S. officials 
called daily news conferences at which they issued angry denunciations of one 
another. Chinese officials accused the American visitors of trying to interfere 
in China's domestic politics. At one point, Christopher told his Chinese host, 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, "I wish the talks were as good as the lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials contended this week that the secretary of state is 
still in charge of Administration negotiations with China. "We have had an 
intensive dialogue with China, following up on the presentation Secretary 
Christopher made in Beijing," one Administration official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a carefully worded statement, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman in 
Beijing told The Times on Friday that it had not been informed of any special 
emissaries sent to China by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Rone Tempest in Beijing and Doyle McManus in Geneva 
contributed to this report.

BETTY ASHER; COLLECTOR OF CONTEMPORARY ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Betty Asher, a contemporary art collector and dealer who was a major force on 
Los Angeles' art scene for 30 years, died Wednesday at the age of 80 at her 
home in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 She had suffered for several years from myelofibrosis, a blood disorder that 
causes fibrous tissue to replace the bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
 An aficionado of Pop Art and a longtime affiliate of the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art, Ms. Asher was best known for amassing a huge collection of 
unorthodox cups created by artists. More sculptures than functional vessels, 
the cups epitomize the artists' styles while reflecting the collector's 
personality. A major portion of the collection is among the permanent holdings 
of the county museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Betty Asher was a passionate collector with an unerring eye, always open to 
new art," said Stephanie Barron, head of curatorial affairs at the museum. "Her 
devotion to emerging artists was legendary and her collection of cups by 
artists was internationally renowned. Betty is the only person in the art world 
about whom I've never heard a negative comment." 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Asher joined the museum's staff in 1966 as a curatorial assistant in the 
department of 20th-Century art and later helped to found the Modern and 
Contemporary Art Council, a private fund-raising group. 
</P>
<P>
 She resigned from the museum in 1979 to join art dealer Patricia Faure in 
launching the Asher/Faure Gallery. The West Hollywood showcase opened with an 
exhibition of paintings by New York artist Morris Louis and later presented 
works by such prominent artists as Joel Shapiro, Kenneth Noland, Sam Francis, 
Gwynn Murrill and Michael McMillen. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of pharmacist Edward Michael and his wife, Rayna DeCosta, Ms. 
Asher was born May 6, 1914, in Chicago and became a registered nurse at Michael 
Reese Hospital. She and her former husband, Dr. Leonard Asher, moved to Los 
Angeles during World War II. They had two children, Michael Asher, a conceptual 
artist, and the late Rayna Asher Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her son, Ms. Asher is survived by four granddaughters.

RICHARD H. BUSKIRK; HEAD OF USC ENTREPRENEUR PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard H. Buskirk, an educator, businessman and consultant who directed the 
USC entrepreneur program for 10 years, has died at age 67. 
</P>
<P>
 Buskirk died Tuesday of a heart attack while visiting his son, Bruce, in 
Valdasta, Ga., his business partner Barbara J. Stanton said.  
</P>
<P>
 Buskirk was the author of 22 books and several articles about marketing and 
starting and managing businesses. Regularly sought out by news media as an 
expert on business and economic trends, Buskirk was a frequent guest on radio 
and television talk shows including "Donahue." He also served on the boards of 
directors of several companies, and had recently been a planning commissioner 
for Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 Buskirk retired as Joseph DeBell professor of entrepreneurship at USC in 1989. 
During his long tenure, he taught future executives his motto: "Credibility is 
like virginity: You only lose it once." 
</P>
<P>
 When four of his entrepreneur program alumni founded "Looking Good!" which 
showcased attractive USC students in calendars and date books, Buskirk proudly 
said:  
</P>
<P>
 "These guys were really pioneers. They started this whole industry of beefcake 
calendars and such. They've got a very worthwhile enterprise, and they started 
it from nothing, from just an idea. They took a very mundane idea, and they 
were able to sustain it, to make it grow. They're entrepreneurs, no question 
about it. These guys are hustlers." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton, Buskirk's partner in the Institute for the Long Beach-based 
Development of Entrepreneurs, said Buskirk provided special encouragement to 
minorities and dislocated workers who lost jobs through company downsizing. She 
said he founded the USC minority seminar series to aid multicultural 
businesses, served as a director and instructor at the Entrepreneur Educational 
Center, and directed curriculum for the Institute for the Development of 
Entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Bloomington, Ind., Buskirk earned a bachelor's and master's degree in 
business administration at Indiana University, and a doctorate at the 
University of Washington. He also taught marketing and business administration 
at the universities of Kansas, Washington, Oklahoma and Colorado, Cal State 
Fullerton and Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his son, Bruce, Buskirk is survived by his wife, Barbara Jean; 
a daughter, Carol Power of Fayetteville, N.C., and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the American Heart 
Assn.

ANNI ALBERS; TEXTILE ARTIST, LAST OF BAUHAUS TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anni Albers, 94, a major textile artist who studied and taught at Germany's 
famous Bauhaus design school. The widow of abstract artist Josef Albers, she 
was the last surviving teacher of the Bauhaus. Mrs. Albers enrolled in the 
Weimar school three years after it opened in 1919, met her husband there, and 
taught there with him until the Nazis closed it in 1933.Moving to the United 
States, she taught art at Black Mountain College in North Carolina despite the 
fact that she initially spoke no English. In 1949, Mrs. Albers became the first 
weaver to have a solo exhibition at New York's Museum of Modern Art. The museum 
owns the best collection of her textiles, which reflected abstract paintings in 
their geometric patterns and complex weaves enriched by knotting. She designed 
fabrics for Knoll International and rugs for Larsen Carpet. In the 1950s, she 
wrote two popular books on textile art, "On Weaving" and "On Designing." In her 
later years, Mrs. Albers turned to printmaking, producing work for Tamarind 
Lithography Workshop, where she had studied in Los Angeles before it moved to 
Albuquerque, and for Gemini G.E.L. of Los Angeles. Her weavings have been 
exhibited at UCLA's Frederick S. Wight Art Gallery and her prints at UC 
Riverside's art gallery. On Monday in Orange, Conn.

RECONCILIATION TURNS FATAL; GARDEN GROVE OFFICER IS HELD IN WIFE'S SLAYING; SHE 
HAD SOUGHT NEW START TO MARRIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just last week, 21-year-old Simona Tucker moved back into the Moreno Valley 
home she shared with her husband, Garden Grove Police Officer Derrick Tucker, 
hoping for a fresh start to their troubled marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days later -- on her first Mother's Day -- the 21-year-old Romanian 
immigrant was dead, and her 32-year-old husband was later booked into jail on 
suspicion of her murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who were parents of a 9-month-old daughter, had separated several 
times since their 1991 Las Vegas wedding, and Derrick Tucker was "terrified of 
losing" his wife, said Simona Tucker's mother, Irina Cornea.  
</P>
<P>
 "He loved her, but he was crazy jealous," Cornea, who was surrounded by 
relatives, said Friday from her Anaheim home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside County Sheriff's Department received a frantic 911 call from 
Derrick Tucker at 1:09 p.m. Sunday. The police officer told a dispatcher that 
his wife had been shot in the head with a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were both playing with the gun," he can be heard saying on a tape of the 6 
1/2-minute call, released by the Sheriff's Department on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker told the dispatcher the couple had been "hugging and kissing" before 
his wife was shot and that she was no longer breathing. He said that they had 
not been arguing. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's baby, Rebecca Doris Tucker, was sleeping in another room and was 
not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, a patrolman with Garden Grove since 1990, was taken in for questioning 
on Sunday and released pending further investigation, Sheriff's Deputy Mark 
Lohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohman said Tucker remained a suspect, and that investigators discovered 
"several discrepancies in his account," which he would not specify.  
</P>
<P>
 Tucker turned himself in to authorities Thursday and is being held at the 
Robert Presley Detention Center in Riverside on suspicion of murder. His bail 
has been set at $250,000. He is due to be arraigned Friday in Riverside 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been placed on administrative leave from his job.  
</P>
<P>
 Simona Tucker's death has left her close-knit family, who emigrated from 
Romania to Orange County six years ago, angry and devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody expected to come to the United States and have this happen," said the 
victim's uncle, Mike Palcu. "We expected bad things to happen in Romania when 
(dictator Nicolae) Ceausescu was in power. We came here to escape oppression 
and to be free." 
</P>
<P>
 Simona Tucker was the youngest of four children born to Ioan and Irina Cornea, 
who are from Medias, a small town in Transylvania. Family members said she 
spoke excellent English and often served as a translator for them and other 
members of the Romanian community. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very good daughter who was very friendly and had good relationships 
with everyone," Irina Cornea said. "She's an angel now who is in heaven, and I 
hope that one day we will meet her again." 
</P>
<P>
 The family said the couple met in February, 1991, when Tucker was called to 
the Garden Grove home of a relative who was having a domestic dispute. Tucker 
left his telephone number with Simona, then began aggressively courting her, 
family members said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were married three weeks after that first meeting, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very possessive," said the victim's sister-in-law, Corina Cornea, 21. 
"He would call her several times a day. He would call her in the middle of the 
night. He would call her from work." 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said Tucker was not physically abusive to his wife, but 
sometimes punched walls and kept a gun under their bed. They said he also tried 
to keep her away from her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Simona Tucker had left her husband at least five times during their marriage, 
her family said, and had no plans to return after the last separation. But 
eventually, she did return with their child. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told her he was going to make it work and buy her a house closer to her 
family, so that's what made her go back to him," Corina Cornea said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family said Simona Tucker's death was only the beginning of what has been 
a weeklong nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members learned of her death 12 hours after the shooting, when they 
were contacted by the coroner's office. They immediately drove to the Moreno 
Valley home and spoke with Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hugged us and cried," said 24-year-old Ioan Cornea Jr., the victim's 
oldest brother. "I asked him why he didn't call us, why did we have to be 
called by the coroner. I told him that I thought he killed my sister." 
</P>
<P>
 During the four days that Derrick Tucker remained free, he began planning his 
wife's funeral without their knowledge, the victim's relatives said. They 
feared that he "would have her body cremated and go free," Ioan Cornea Jr. 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they were relieved to learn that Tucker was in jail. The family then 
began planning Simona's funeral, which will be Monday at Forest Lawn Memorial 
Park in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said they have also not seen the couple's daughter, who remains 
with Tucker's relatives. They said they plan legal action to get custody of the 
girl.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the mood was somber at the Garden Grove Police Department on 
Friday. Officials there said they were unable to discuss the case but some 
expressed their shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all so bewildering," Officer Richard Morales said. "It would seem to be 
extremely out of character." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Tucker had not had any disciplinary problems while at the 
department. He last worked on May 7, the day before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was even-tempered and always willing to perform," Sgt. Joe Johnson said. 
"He hadn't had any problems internally and was thought of as a very likable 
young man. There's a lot of disbelief around here. This is definitely a first 
for this department."

UNION ENDS STRIKE IN ORANGE SCHOOL DISTRICT; WALKOUT: LEADERS SAY PROGRESS IN 
MEETING TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES PROMPTED DECISION TO GET NON-TEACHING EMPLOYEES 
BACK ON JOB MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After meeting with school officials for the first time since the walkout by 
more than 400 non-teaching employees, union leaders Friday declared an end to 
the 10-day strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement comes as welcome news to parents, teachers and administrators 
in the district of 26,000 students, which was severely strained by the walkout. 
The strike virtually shut down the Orange Unified School District's bus and 
child-care services, and even prompted hundreds of students to leave campus in 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sense of relief," said Becky Mayers, president of the California 
Employees Assn., Chapter 67, which represents about 1,160 classified employees 
including clerical, custodial and food service workers as well as bus drivers. 
"I just hope we can finish up Monday and get on with the normal things of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials made the decision to return to work Monday because "there has 
been significant movement" with district negotiators in settling sharp 
differences over a controversial school board-imposed contract, Mayers said. 
For the first time since the strike began, district and union leaders met 
face-to-face Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some good verbal discussions today," said Jack Elsner, head of the 
district's personnel department. "We still have some brainstorming to do on a 
few final matters." 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides said they will probably finalize an agreement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In that meeting, district and union officials are expected to approve 
switching health insurance companies, a move that would reduce insurance costs 
for classified workers and retirees from $4.8 million to $4.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is also expected to yield some revision of a hotly disputed clause 
that currently empowers the district to lay off or reduce the hours of workers 
without notice. Union leaders have denounced the clause as "union-busting." 
</P>
<P>
 A closed-door school board meeting Thursday night paved the way for Friday's 
progress. At that four-hour meeting, trustees voted 4-3 to authorize 
face-to-face talks between the district and the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees have explained that the contract was necessary to balance the 
district's $107-million budget. The contract, which took effect April 10, saved 
the school district $484,000 and helped offset a $2.2-million shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they did not report to work Friday, strikers ceased picketing at 
district headquarters and more than 30 schools in the sprawling school system. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the strike eliminated bus service to an estimated 7,000 students, 
parents were forced to battle through jammed school parking lots every day to 
drop off and pick up their children.

 THE WAIT GOES ON: Families of John Wayne Gacy's 33 murder victims were bitter 
that it took 14 years of appeals before his execution in Illinois this week. 
The wait is long for prosecutors too.Seven of 28 Death Row inmates from Orange 
County have been on appeal for a decade or more. The longest: William Charles 
Payton, sentenced over 12 years ago for the rape and murder of a Garden Grove 
woman. . . . Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley favors keeping appeals from 
going to the federal courts: "It's frustrating, because it never seems to end."

 In all, 38 properties could be directly or indirectly affected by the 
landslide, the seven-week study by Laguna Beach-based Geofirm revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fire victims may have to spend as much as $100,000 to stabilize their 
property for rebuilding unless neighbors unite and devise an area-wide solution 
to the problem, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The news means more delays for disaster-weary residents, many of whom are 
still unable to begin the rebuilding process nearly seven months after the 
wildfire swept through this area, destroying or damaging more than 400 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire was an inconvenience, but what the city is putting us through has 
turned this into a tragedy and a disaster," said Mary Peterson, who now lives 
in a mobile home on her burned lot. Peterson said the city should simply let 
fire victims sign a waiver and start rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather sign the paper, get on with the building and get on with my life," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents in Mystic Hills and nearby Temple Hills -- which is now being 
studied for similar problems -- said they are more concerned with plummeting 
property values caused by the talk of ancient landslides than they are with the 
prospect of the earth shifting beneath their homes. Troubling geological 
conditions exist throughout Southern California, they noted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frank said the city is simply doing what it must to protect the health and 
safety of its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just cannot allow people to rebuild, or to build, without a geologist 
certifying it's safe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the overall "factors of safety" are "substantially below the normally 
accepted minimum level . . . for residential development," Geofirm recommended 
in the report that the land be stabilized. The city, as owner of public land, 
would be responsible for an unspecified percentage of the cost, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Geofirm is suggesting that the city and private geologists conduct a detailed 
study leading to the creation of a stabilization plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The $35,000 Geofirm report will be the subject of a special City Council 
meeting today at 3 p.m., during which Geofirm will explain the report to 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank said he will recommend that a second meeting be scheduled for May 21 so 
property owners, city staff, Geofirm and private geologists can share 
geological information and consider solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The new findings could pit property owners whose homes were not burned in the 
firestorm against those who must rebuild over who should pay for shoring up the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes that are still standing "are not going to be affected (by ancient 
landslides) unless there is heavy rain -- probably for more than one winter -- 
or an earthquake hits the area," Frank said. "Nobody needs to move out of their 
house at this point in time. It is stable right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire victims face varying hurdles, depending in part on where their homes are 
positioned over the landslide, a narrow, tear-shaped area beneath the surface 
of the earth that measures 830 feet long by 340 feet wide.  
</P>
<P>
 The slide lies under a portion of a west-facing hillside, and the report notes 
that a "steeply dipping fault" lies along the landslide's southern boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 Stabilization costs for each homeowner are not specified in the Geofirm 
report, but "worst case looks to be in the neighborhood of $100,000," Frank 
said. "Most will not be that bad." Some lots may be steadied for a "relatively 
modest" price, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual solutions range from simply laying a deeper foundation than existed 
before the fire to pouring cement caissons deep into the earth, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Cabang, whose parents' home was destroyed in the fire and whose 
property will require major grading and the installation of caissons, according 
to Geofirm, said her parents had hoped to rebuild on their Coronado Drive lot.  
</P>
<P>
 But she said she is uncertain how much of the geological work their insurance 
company will cover. Their policy allows building code upgrades costing as much 
as $10,000, Cabang said, "a drop in the bucket" considering the stabilization 
project that may lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it seems like this is going to be more than we can handle, if too much 
money is going to come out of our pockets, we may have to consider . . . not 
rebuilding," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The area studied by Geofirm involves several rows of homes above City Hall, 
including portions of Vista Lane, Bermuda Drive, Coronado Drive and Anacapa 
Way. To examine the area, workers dug 10 two-foot-wide holes at various 
locations and studied exposed slopes and aerial photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 The landslide's exact boundaries are ill-defined and could be revised upon 
further study, the report notes. Geofirm is recommending that deep borings be 
dug on lots next to the landslide to verify that the boundaries are accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Geofirm officials declined to answer questions about the report Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, some residents have become critical of the post-fire 
rebuilding effort, which they contend has resulted in their lots being too 
closely scrutinized for geological problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Ann Christoph said earlier this week that had individual property 
owners learned later that their homes were atop a landslide, their financial 
burden might have been even greater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those people would pretty much be out of luck because there wouldn't be 20 
other people in the same boat and there would be no reason for the city to get 
involved," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And some of those problems are not solvable on the basis of one property at a 
time," she added. "There may be a solution to the total problem that is much, 
much less expensive than each person trying to address it by himself." 
Teetering on the Edge 
</P>
<P>
 About two dozen lots in the fire-scarred Mystic Hills community lie atop a 
newly discoveredancient landslide. Fourteen other lots were found to be 
adjacent to the slide. Property owners with homes still standing might not have 
to stabilize their lots, but others who lost homesin the fire may be required 
to do extensive underground work before receiving city approval to rebuild.

ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS TRANSFER TO TOLLWAY IS LEGAL; TRANSPORTATION: OPINION 
CONTRADICTS THAT BY LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL THAT INCORPORATION OF NEWPORT COAST 
DRIVE INTO PAY ROAD VIOLATED STATE LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One day after opponents of a South County toll road gleaned hope from a legal 
opinion that a stretch of public road had been transferred illegally to a 
tollway agency, the state attorney general's office issued another opinion 
Friday saying the transfer was legal. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's opinion contradicted the one offered by the legislative 
counsel on Thursday. Both opinions were requested by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach), who has been a critic of the 17-mile tollway that will run 
from Newport Beach to San Juan Capistrano, and neither is binding. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative counsel, which researches legal issues for members of the 
Assembly, said Orange County and the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor 
Agency apparently broke state law when they incorporated Newport Coast Drive 
into a tollway without first conducting hearings. The hearings were required, 
that office said, because the county "abandoned" the road. 
</P>
<P>
 But the attorney general's opinion found "no legal abandonment by the county," 
and said Newport Coast Drive will continue to be used "as a public highway" 
despite the toll drivers will have to pay. As a public entity, the tollway 
agency had a right to convert the public road into the tollway, the attorney 
general's opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stockstill, spokesman for the tollway agency, said the opinion from Atty. 
Gen. Dan Lungren's office "was a complete and total affirmation of our 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't ask for this. This opinion was rendered at Ferguson's request. We 
hope this puts some finality to the issue," Stockstill said. "This really 
closes a chapter as far as we're concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson expressed disappointment with the attorney general's opinion and 
vowed to continue pressing for public hearings. A bill he introduced in the 
Assembly, which would require the county to hold hearings on the transfer of 
the road to the tollway agency, awaits a vote in the Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much we can do except to continue to proceed and see if I can get 
the bill through the Legislature," Ferguson said. "The bill I have pending says 
that if they're going to do this, they will have to hold hearings. And if the 
transfer still occurs, they must build roads parallel to the tollway that 
people can use for free."  
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's opinion also affirmed that the agency was not required 
to hold public hearings to discuss the imposition of tolls on Newport Coast 
Drive, as opponents had argued in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are unaware of any law which required the agency to hold meetings to 
specifically discuss the imposition of tolls or the proposed locations of the 
tollbooths," the opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the opinion said the agency nevertheless had made the public aware of the 
proposed tollbooth on Newport Coast Drive by including the booth on maps that 
accompanied notices of the hearings for the environmental impact report. 
According to the opinion, the agency sent the notices to 4,500 public agencies, 
interested parties and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative counsel's opinion said the road transfer also was illegal 
because the tollway agency was required to do another environmental impact 
report when it decided to incorporate it into the toll road. However, this 
issue was not addressed in the attorney general's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the attorney general's report suggested the county's proposed 
extension of Newport Coast Drive to Bonita Canyon Drive might have a positive 
environmental impact by reducing traffic on nearby Coast Highway in Corona del 
Mar from 46,000 trips per day to 31,000 by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 Both supporters and opponents agree the question about whether Newport Coast 
Drive was legally transferred to the tollway agency would be made moot if the 
extension was built. The extension would provide a free alternative to Newport 
Beach residents who do not want to use the tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that county officials have not decided on a route for the 
proposed extension because of opposition from local groups, who do not want the 
road built in their areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that people concerned with this (Newport Coast Drive issue) look to 
the solution, and the solution is the extension," Stockstill said. "What else 
can you say about this? When the bell finally rings, it's rung."

MEMORIES OF A HAVEN LIVE ON AT UCLA; EDUCATION: STEVENS HOUSE SHELTERED WOMEN 
FROM RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. FORMER RESIDENTS WILL REUNITE TO AWARD 
SCHOLARSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the beginning, fried chicken was used to fight racial discrimination at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Money raised at chicken dinners supplied the $4,000 down payment on an old 
duplex a few miles south of the campus. Volunteers chopped through walls to 
join the two units, added hand-me-down furnishings and turned the building into 
a place where minority women students could live and study. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how the Stevens House started a remarkable four-decade role as a 
shelter -- and as a conscience -- for many university students. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 22-bed residence opened in 1948, blacks, Asian Americans and Latinos 
could not find places in the school's only dorm and were excluded from Westwood 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wouldn't say you couldn't rent, they'd just say it was already 'taken,' 
" said Hazel Hashimoto Dunbar, a Japanese American who lived at Stevens House 
in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 The house replaced "an hour-and-a-half ride to class from where I lived over 
near Central" Avenue in 1953, said singer Barbara McNair. 
</P>
<P>
 It allowed state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles)to live close enough to 
participate in campus activities during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One Westwood landlady vowed that "over her dead body would any colored girls 
come in," the Los Angeles Democrat said. "You could not live on Hilgard if you 
were black, except at the Y." 
</P>
<P>
 Civil rights legislation and new on-campus housing eventually ended the need 
for Stevens House. Two years ago, it was closed and the building was sold for 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 3 p.m. Sunday, many of the 800 women who lived there over the years 
will gather at 580 Hilgard Ave. for a reunion -- and to give scholarships 
endowed by the sale of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees of the house say a perpetual $40,000 grant for "underrepresented 
minority students" will be named for two house founders, Venye Corporal and 
Episcopal Bishop Bertand Stevens. He headed UCLA's University Religious 
Conference, which spearheaded its creation. 
</P>
<P>
 Discrimination practices initially kept the Stevens House out of Westwood. 
Starting at a site near University High School, the center moved twice before 
ending up on Landfair Avenue next to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The house always operated on a shoestring budget, charging residents minimal 
rent. Residents did the cooking and cleaning. Volunteers struggled to keep the 
place repaired and to maintain an emergency loan fund for residents -- many of 
whom were also living on a shoestring budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very difficult decision to sell. We all knew the work that had gone 
into it," said Johnetta Jones, a retired View Park teacher and longtime Stevens 
House board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Sheila Harkrider, a legal secretary from Agoura Hills, said 
those in charge finally decided that changing laws -- and attitudes -- had 
resolved the conflicts that led to its creation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Housing isn't the most critical issue at UCLA now. Keeping up with tuition 
is," said Twala Wells-Stewart, a university administrator from San Diego who 
moved into Stevens House as a freshman in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact Stevens House existed was conscience-raising," she said. "Until the 
campus and society at large caught up, it was a voice for students who had no 
other voice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dunbar, a semi-retired after-school playground program administrator from 
South-Central Los Angeles, said Stevens House was important to her 40 years ago 
-- and still is today. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it hadn't existed, I'd have had to travel four hours a day on a bus from 
Gardena," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that the house always sought a mixture of races, including whites, 
to expose the women to all cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helped me grow up and understand people from different backgrounds. That's 
helped me all my life."

THE CLOSE OF A FLAMBOYANT LIFE; STYLE: RESTAURATEUR AND LATIN ART PROMOTER 
MARIO TAMAYO DIES. HE STARTED RENAISSANCE ON EASTERN MELROSE WITH CARIBBEAN 
EATERIES. HIS LAST VENTURE WAS ATLAS BAR & GRILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was New Year's Eve, 1992. When you walked through the curtained entrance to 
Atlas Bar & Grill, you found a spectacular mirrored wall, a cavernous expanse 
with a stage flanked by hanging suns, and beautiful men and women imbibing as 
well as serving drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding over it all was Mario Tamayo -- indefatigable restaurateur, style 
maker, and promoter of Latin American arts. On this evening, he was dressed in 
a tuxedo, swathed in a black feather boa, his dark hair slicked down with a 
curlicue adorning his forehead. As always, he brandished a cigarette holder. On 
stage that night, Eartha Kitt sang "I'm Still Here" -- appropriate enough for 
this group of artists and partygoers who rode the bumps and crests of the 
cutting edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamayo flourished in this milieu until his death early Friday morning of 
complications of AIDS. Along the way, he jump-started the lively if brief 
renaissance of eastern Melrose Avenue with the Caribbean restaurants Cha Cha 
Cha and Cafe Mambo, and an art gallery -- later a men's clothing store -- 
called Modern Objects. 
</P>
<P>
 He introduced the various flavors of Latin American food and art to an avant 
garde cultural scene that had been largely devoid of Latino influences up to 
that point. He collected a dazzling and devoted array of friends and 
connections, from musicians such as Puerto Rican bandleader Tito Puente and 
Cuban singer Celia Cruz to such artists as David Hockney and Roberto Gilde 
Montes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a town known for schmoozers, he was a networker par excellence. And nothing 
better exemplified his style than his last restaurant, Atlas Bar & Grill. It 
was a world of latter-day Hollywood glamour that Tamayo stubbornly stoked even 
as the street out in front was unglamorously torn up by Metro Rail construction 
and the restaurant's valet parking was curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you spent the evening with him, he treated you like a superstar," said 
fashion designer Jef Huereque, a friend and former business partner. "Mario 
always remembered something about you." 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian-born Tamayo immigrated to the United States with his parents at 
the age of 8 and molded himself into a Hollywood success story of several 
chapters before his death at 36. 
</P>
<P>
 The third of six children, he spent 10 years in Yonkers, N.Y., with his 
seamstress mother and mechanic father before the family moved to San Gabriel. 
He attended East Los Angeles College for a year before enrolling in beauty 
school on a whim and becoming a hairdresser. He acquired a roster of celebrity 
clients, worked as a stylist for fashion magazines and videos, and had his own 
Melrose Avenue salon for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1985, he was restless for new challenges. He was on his way to London 
to study film when a stopover in New York and a chance dinner with friends at a 
Caribbean restaurant spurred a new plan. He returned to Los Angeles and decided 
to introduce Caribbean cuisine in the city. With a chef and partner, Tibirio 
Prado, he opened Cha Cha Cha in 1986 in a tiny building at the shabby corner of 
Melrose and Virgil avenues. His mother told him the neighborhood was a dump, 
but Tamayo had a gift for turning ugly ducklings into flamboyant swans. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant was an overnight sensation, and Tamayo took the profits and, 
with Huereque, opened the art gallery Modern Objects -- later remaking it into 
the clothing store -- also on Melrose. His third venture was Cafe Mambo in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 His restaurants became meccas for varied crowds. You might walk in and see 
state Sen. Art Torres, French designer Thierry Mugler, and a passel of artists, 
established and renegade. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always had such a creative touch in bringing together cuisine and culture 
that I think was very different for Los Angeles," said Torres, who sometimes 
took his mother to brunch at Cha Cha Cha.  
</P>
<P>
 Tamayo's businesses helped attract others to Melrose and for a while the area 
flourished. But after a few years, Tamayo had a falling out with his partner, 
Prado, and he left Cha Cha Cha. Eventually he closed Modern Objects, a victim 
of hard economic times, and Cafe Mambo. Huereque says the neighborhood has 
never been the same since Tamayo moved out. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurateur had turned his attentions to what would be his last and 
grandest venture, Atlas Bar & Grill, which he opened with a group of limited 
partners. The food was continental and uneven, but the ambience was 
spectacular. In the best tradition of restaurants as theater, Atlas always 
boasted a wild array of patrons as well as entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamayo hopped around town from clubs to galleries, catching the attention of 
gossip columnists and magazines such as Vanity Fair and Details. But he wasn't 
just a party animal. He was on the board of AIDS Project L.A. as well as Los 
Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He attended every opening, whether it was art or a can opening," said Xiomara 
Fonseca, a close friend of Tamayo and the road manager for Cruz. "He said, 
'It's always important to make the time.' He was always running around, pushing 
Latino artists." 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Tuchman, senior curator of 20th-Century art at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art, agreed. "Mario was important in always raising the flag for 
Latin art," he said. Startled to learn of Tamayo's death, Tuchman said he had 
been planning to discuss with him artists he was watching. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist Roberto Gilde Montes met Tamayo at a show for the artist in Santa 
Fe. "Even though it was a happening for artists, he was kind of the center of 
it all," said Gilde Montes, who recalls that at the time Tamayo had 
platinum-colored hair. Even in Santa Fe, Tamayo had masterminded a party 
afterward at a restaurant -- with about 200 friends. "It was very difficult to 
pay the bill," said Gilde Montes, chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamayo's lifestyle was not unusually luxurious. According to his friends, he 
put his money back into his businesses. He collected the art of many of his 
artist friends. And he lived near his restaurant in the Mid-Wilshire district 
in an Art Deco apartment with views of the beach and Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 His extravagances were all in his style. "He has this Latin chic," said 
Huereque. "He was a dandy, I guess you would say. He was a man of many changes. 
He had blond hair, red hair, short hair, long hair. He had incredible style." 
</P>
<P>
 In his final weeks, as friends visited and chatted and cooked him dinner, he 
had shaved his head. Chemotherapy had begun to ravage his hair. He attended an 
opening a month ago, dressed in white slacks and white sweater, his head 
slickly absent of hair. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent his last days in his apartment, and he died as he lived, surrounded 
by family and friends.

CITYSCAPES / TINA DAUNT: FOR PORN PROTESTERS, X MARKS SPOT THAT TAINTS

<P>
 On a gritty corner of Whittier Boulevard and Arizona Avenue, the faithful 
begin their afternoon march, back and forth, picket signs in hand. It is Day 45 
of the crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 Their numbers have dwindled since they started their protest in March. Lately, 
only a couple dozen regulars are left to carry on the campaign, hoping their 
mere presence will ruin the business of one of East Los Angeles' newest 
retailers: Andy's Adult World. 
</P>
<P>
 Marta Hernandez, mother of three, paces along the sidewalk outside the adult 
book and video store in black platform shoes. It's only an hour into the 
demonstration, and already her voice is hoarse from yelling at the passing 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want no porn in our community!" Hernandez says, her rapid-fire words 
carrying across four lanes of traffic. "We have morals. We have a culture. This 
doesn't fit our culture. We don't want it here. We don't like it here. We said 
no. They put it here anyway. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been nearly two months since Andy's opened its doors in a strip mall 
occupied by such businesses as a shoe shop, a beauty salon and a women's 
clothing store. Hernandez and other Eastside residents appealed to county 
supervisors in February to deny the store's request for an operating permit. 
But the residents -- almost all of them women with children and grandchildren 
-- ran into a snag. 
</P>
<P>
 While the supervisors said the county's anti-pornography ordinance barred 
Andy's from operating, a federal judge later ruled the law unconstitutional -- 
prompting store owner Craig Tucker to open for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the protesters' only recourse is to take their objections to the street. 
Every afternoon, rain or shine, they chant, yell and pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Abboud, who owns a nearby clothing store, walks 10 feet along the 
pavement, turns on his heel and walks back. He carries a sign that says simply: 
"Porno Does Not Upgrade Our Community." 
</P>
<P>
 "East Los Angeles is not a trash can," Abboud yells at a passing bus. "Take 
this trash elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic responds in a chorus of supportive honks. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside Andy's Adult World, business is brisk. 
</P>
<P>
 The store is drenched in bright fluorescent light, creating a sterile, 
office-like atmosphere. Several men, who avoided the protesters by walking in 
the store's back door, wander around, looking at racks displaying X-rated 
videos. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio plays a synthesizer-edged Duran Duran song, but the music is not 
loud enough to drown out the protesters' voices.

<P>
 "Why don't they do something else?" asks a customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the counter, Sean Samuelson, 21, and clean-cut, shrugs.  
</P>
<P>
 "We opened March 28, and they've been here since Day 1. We just let them air 
out steam," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, Samuelson says, he stays in constant phone contact with 
Tucker, keeping him informed of the protesters' actions while Tucker is running 
the pawnshop he owns up the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker believes the crusade will only help his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are advertising for us," he says. "A lot of people come in and tell us 
that if they weren't here, they wouldn't know where the store was." 
</P>
<P>
 One customer, wishing to remain anonymous, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just driving by and heard all the screaming," he says. "They pointed it 
out to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The men in the shop laugh, pausing for a moment before going back to viewing 
the women on the covers of the videos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By 4 p.m., two hours into the demonstration, the protesters have doubled, with 
more than 20 adults and children lining up along the sidewalk, their picket 
signs bobbing in unison.  
</P>
<P>
 Jasmine Santiago was just walking past with her five children when the 
crusaders, many of them neighborhood friends, urged her to join the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured, why not?" she said. "Porno is no good." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters grab signs declaring, "East L.A. Is a Family Oriented 
Community" and "Get Out. Stay Out of Our Neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of their lungs, the children scream: ' 'Pitale, pitale! . . . Honk 
your horn!"  
</P>
<P>
 The yelling and the honking drown out everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Fernandez, a thick-necked fellow with a flattop, monitors the spectacle. 
He was hired by Tucker to work as the store's security guard. He sits outside 
the door, teetering on a stool. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are dumb," he says, looking up for a minute before going back to 
his word-search puzzle book. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez isn't the only one annoyed by the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounding businesses say they have no problem with an X-rated video store 
moving into the neighborhood. It's the protesters who are driving them crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got such a headache," said Susanna Shin, who owns the women's clothing 
store next door. "Two months of this? I can't make money this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Marta Hernandez, who has lived in East L.A. for 23 years, knows her 
demonstrations have angered some people. Several weeks ago, she started 
bringing her camera along, to take pictures of hecklers and store customers. 
She has already shot 25 rolls of film. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just doing what we think is right for our kids," she says. "It's 
everyone's responsibility to come out here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be here every day if we have to."

COUNCIL ADOPTS POLICE UNION'S CONTRACT OFFER; GOVERNMENT: PLAN CALLS FOR A 6% 
PAY RAISE OVER TWO YEARS. RANK-AND-FILE OFFICERS WILL MEET THURSDAY TO VOTE ON 
THE PROPOSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council adopted the police union's contract offer Friday, 
sending the contentious labor dispute into its final phase -- a vote by the 
membership of the Police Protective League. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting in closed session, the council voted 12 to 2 in favor of a 6% salary 
increase over two years, the first raise for the Police Department since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative pact does not include a bonus for patrol officers or a 
restructuring of the detective ranks, which the city had sought, but the 
contract language calls for both matters to be hashed out in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also no retroactive pay for the roughly two years that officers have 
sought a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning patrol officers in the LAPD currently make $33,157 -- at least 
$2,800 more a year than those in New York, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and 
Houston. But they have slipped to eighth in pay among the 10 largest police 
departments in California, where some rookies make up to $10,000 a year more 
than beginning LAPD officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's like most negotiations -- it's a compromise," said council 
President John Ferraro. "They didn't get everything they wanted and we didn't 
get everything we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The focus now shifts to the 7,000 members of the police union, who will meet 
Thursday to vote on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders immediately began the process of selling the plan to members. 
They fielded telephone calls from rank-and-file officers throughout the day and 
planned to visit police roll calls in the coming days to lay out the details. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good deal during bad economic times," said union spokesman Geoffrey 
Garfield. "The city played ferocious hardball, and now here we are in the ninth 
inning and we've just knocked out some triples and homers." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the new contract will bring an end to a 2-year-old dispute that 
included officers picketing City Hall, staging a sickout and erecting 
billboards that depicted a carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the city balked at providing the officers with any raise, saying 
the city's tight budget made pay increases impossible. The union, on the other 
hand, demanded the same 9% raise over three years given to city utility 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good for the cops and good for the city," said Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, chairman of the council's Budget and Finance Committee. "Most 
importantly, this is something the city can afford." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky and Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg met with union officials Tuesday 
night to hash out final details, leading the way to Friday's settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The patrol bonus -- which the Christopher Commission recommended to refocus 
the department's attention on street patrols -- remained the final sticking 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 The union said giving patrol officers more than other officers would divide 
its membership. Councilman Marvin Braude voted against the contract proposal 
Friday because he said the city caved in to the union's opposition to patrol 
bonuses. "I believe the mayor and the council have made a serious mistake in 
ratifying this," said Braude, who chairs the council's Public Safety Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rita Walters cast the other no vote, saying the city cannot 
afford pay raises during tough economic times. Councilman Mike Hernandez was 
absent.

 CONROY'S CANE: Many of his fellow legislators consider his idea ludicrous, but 
Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) is getting calls almost 50-1 in favor of his idea for 
a bill to start "caning" juvenile graffiti vandals. Even New York deejay Howard 
Stern praised him. . . . Conroy says it wouldn't really be a caning, but a 
public paddling -- up to six whacks. It wouldn't be brutality, he says, but a 
needed "humbling."

WATER DISTRICT FIRES LONGTIME GENERAL COUNSEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move to cut costs and break with its troubled past, the Santa Margarita 
Water District has fired its longtime general counsel and plans to offer early 
retirement to its chief engineer, who is under criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors voted last month to terminate the services of Fritz R. 
Stradling, who helped found the special district in 1964 with local landowners 
such as Richard J. O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 Stradling, founding partner of Stradling, Yocca, Carlson & Rauth, Orange 
County's second largest law firm, was present at the board's April 20 meeting, 
in which the directors unanimously voted to terminate his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no animosity, although I am disappointed," Stradling said. "I formed 
the district, but it's a new regime and I think they wanted a change in all 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the district has sought to amend its contract with the state's 
Public Employees' Retirement System so it can offer early retirement to four or 
five of its longtime staffers, including Bill Dye, the district's engineering 
chief for the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye, 58, is expected to be offered credit for two extra years of service at 
the district toward his retirement in exchange for leaving the district within 
the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye, who makes $97,020 a year, has been talking about retiring after he was 
implicated in a criminal investigation over the alleged failure of top district 
officials to disclose gifts from companies that they helped recommend for 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's two top managers, Walter W. (Bill) Knitz and Michael P. Lord, 
face criminal conflict-of-interest charges stemming from their alleged 
acceptance of gifts from companies that relied on their help in getting 
district contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Knitz and Lord have entered not guilty pleas to the misdemeanor charges. 
A pretrial hearing for the two men is scheduled for June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye has not been charged, but prosecutors are still weighing possible charges 
against him and former board Chairman Don B. Schone over their failure to 
report the acceptance of gifts. Government officials have acknowledged, 
however, that neither man accepted anywhere near the number of gifts Knitz and 
Lord are accused of accepting but failing to report. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported in January that Dye and his chief assistant, Dan Ferons, 
received $12,000 in meals and entertainment from an engineering firm that 
received nearly $14 million in contracts from the district, many of them on 
Dye's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although John J. Schatz, the district's general manager, said Dye's expected 
retirement has nothing to do with the criminal investigation, many see the 
departures of Dye and Stradling as a way for the board of directors to reshape 
its image, which was sullied over the past 14 months. During that time, the 
board's composition has been completely overhauled through resignations, 
retirements and last November's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the problems involving Knitz, Lord, Schone and Dye center on their 
alleged failure to report large numbers of gifts and then recommending or 
voting on contracts benefiting the gift-givers, in violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for some of the men have suggested that Stradling should have 
offered better legal guidance on filling out their statements of economic 
interest and should have warned the officials to abstain from recommending 
contracts to people who gave them gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Stradling has said he did his job explaining how the forms should be filled 
out and that it was up to the officials to abstain from voting if they believed 
they had a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they hold me responsible for anything that went wrong, and I 
cannot be held responsible; but it's a new board, a new team, and they want 
some change," said Stradling, who is not part of the criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Stradling's firm will continue to handle bond financing for the district, such 
as the refinancing of several bond issues that will help provide water service 
to a new development. The law firm won that contract after the board voted to 
put the business out for competitive bid. Until that time, Stradling's firm had 
handled the job without competition. 
</P>
<P>
 But the general counsel's duties, which included everything from routine 
advice on legal matters to litigation to the drafting of resolutions and 
agendas, earned the firm more than $2 million over the past years alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just thought that with a new board and new general manager that a change 
was necessary," said Schatz, a lawyer who will be handling some of the legal 
duties. "He was part of the prior regime and his expense was not an issue. It 
was the prior relationship he had with the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Stradling's firm was the subject of a critical legal audit conducted in 
December, 1993, that concluded that the district had overspent for legal 
services by about $150,000 for fiscal year 1992-93, the one year it was 
examined. For that year, the district spent $458,064 for legal services (this 
figure did not include the firm's bond work). 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no compelling reason why the district's legal costs should not have 
fit into the normal range during the period examined," said the audit, 
conducted by EnviroLaw Strategies Inc. of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The normal range for such fees is up to 0.5% of a government agency's annual 
budget. Stradling's fees were 0.75% of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit also included recommendations to reduce the number of attorneys at 
Stradling doing district work, to negotiate a discount on legal fees and to 
consider dividing the legal work among two or more law firms to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Dye, his expected retirement is part of an overall effort to cut costs, 
particularly in the engineering department, which is seen as overstaffed, board 
member Bob Lay said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man has put in 15 years," Lay said. "He's a quality guy, but there comes 
a time for a change, and this is a way to accommodate change in a responsible 
way."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; FIRE CHIEF: FIRINGS WON'T AFFECT SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. said Friday that the firings this week of 
several high-ranking Fire Department officials will not affect the level of 
services the department provides. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no effect on the department, except that people (will) have to work 
more overtime," said DeMonaco. "As far as operations go, nothing has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 DeMonaco said that people from within the department were "temporarily 
promoted" to take over the positions left vacant by the dismissals. Tests will 
be conducted next month to determine if the promotions will be permanent, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials Thursday fired Fire Marshal Don Herr, Battalion Chief Hal 
Raphael, Capts. Mike Garrison and Joe Wilson and firefighter Dana Bowler. They 
were accused of violating payroll policies, and two were also accused of 
negligence, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 They have denied any wrongdoing, and Paul Gilbrook, the president of the 
Westminster Firefighters Assn., said Friday that the dismissals amounted to 
union busting by city officials fighting a union-supported recall drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook said that the firings will strengthen the efforts to recall Mayor 
Charles V. Smith and council members Craig Schweisinger, Charmayne S. Bohman 
and Tony Lam. The recall election is set for June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "People know this is nothing but retribution," said Gilbrook, who was himself 
fired in February. "They know that the firefighters are not crooks, and that 
they truly care for the citizens of Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMonaco said that Capt. Ron Roberts, the deputy fire marshal, will become 
fire marshal, and Capt. Mark Benedetti will replace Raphael as battalion chief. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMonaco, who was hired last August, said there are 10 vacant positions in the 
63-employee department. But he said he expects to fill most of the vacancies by 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMonaco said that the management team reorganization, which calls for the 
hiring of an assistant chief and two division chiefs, will be completed in 
August.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 'RAIN FOREST' FOR THE TREES AND ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the tree branches above a simulated rain forest, curious monkeys at the 
Santa Ana Zoo Friday jumped about and peered down on several dozen visitors who 
had come to see the unveiling of the zoo's newest exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 The gregarious tamarin monkeys are part of a new exhibit that simulates a 
South American rain forest partly damaged by human slash-and-burn land-clearing 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoo director Ron Glazier said the display is intended to prompt visitors to 
think about the roles they play in their environment and to encourage 
conservation of the world's natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "The exhibit shows what will happen to the rain forest if we don't take care 
of it," Glazier said. "The idea of this is to bring some focus and concern to 
the loss of habitat around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The $30,000 Conservation Rain Forest display includes a 54-foot-long, 
16-foot-high cage filled with trees, shrubs and a small waterfall and stream. 
Monkeys share the enclosure with iguanas, rabbit-sized rodents of a species 
called golden-rumped agoutis, and bird species called elegant-crested Tinamous. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby is a wood and stone building that houses two-toed sloths -- hairy, 
slow-moving tree-dwellers who prefer to spend their days hanging upside down 
eating leaves. Glazier said those mammals that thrive only in more tropical 
climates will join the other animals in the outdoor cage once the weather 
warms.  
</P>
<P>
 Parts of the exhibit include devastated and burned trees and foliage to show 
what humans have done to such areas. A chain saw is embedded in one tree stump. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors said they were impressed by the exhibit and its message. "I think 
it's fantastic. It feels like you're walking through a real jungle," said 
Blanche Edwards, 67, who was vacationing from Plain View, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit is a part of a continuing 10-year, $10-million zoo expansion, 
Glazier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo is at 1801 E. Chestnut St. in Prentice Park and is open from 10 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. daily. Admission is $3 for adults, $1 for children age 3 to 12 and 
senior citizens over 62. Children under 3, the disabled and zoo members are 
admitted free.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SLAIN CHOIRMASTER'S 
CONGREGATION MAKES A QUIET BUT HEARTFELT PLEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As demonstrations go, it didn't amount to much -- about 30 people standing in 
four neat rows on the front steps of City Hall, flanked by a couple of 
Episcopal banners and an American flag. 
</P>
<P>
 They tried chanting for awhile: "No more silence for violence." 
</P>
<P>
 But their chants, which weren't very loud, were largely drowned out by 
Friday's midday traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the news crews from the half-dozen vans parked on the sidewalk were 
inside the building, covering the City Council debate over a contract with the 
police union. And most of the pedestrians who wandered by scarcely bothered to 
look up. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rev. Kirk Smith, leader of the demonstration and pastor of St. James 
Episcopal Church in the Wilshire district, was undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the demonstrators want support for Mayor Richard Riordan's campaign 
for more police. The group also seeks funding for the Hope in Youth campaign, a 
church-supported effort to curb gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Friday's demonstration was subdued, it was driven by emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, David John Falconer, the beloved choirmaster of St. James 
church, was shot to death during a holdup at a convenience store. "We need to 
take action together to make this a safer place to live," said Smith, who had 
no delusions about the demonstration's impact.

 "It's a small effort," he said. "But we have to start somewhere." ERIC MALNIC

ROSEANNE ARNOLD PETITIONS FOR DIVORCE A SECOND TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The saga of the stormy marriage of show business couple Roseanne and Tom 
Arnold took another twist Friday when the actress refiled for divorce, 22 days 
after she dropped a previous divorce proceeding against her husband and 
recanted claims that he emotionally and physically abused her. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold, star of ABC's top-rated "Roseanne" series, again cited irreconcilable 
differences in her Los Angeles Superior Court divorce petition. She also asks 
that the court not require her to pay alimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The actress was in Europe and unavailable for comment, said Pat Kingsley, her 
publicist. Tom Arnold on Friday was taping a segment of his CBS series, "Tom," 
but had no comment on the filing, said David Brokaw, his spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The development again seemed to shock the Hollywood community and those close 
to the couple, especially because it came so soon after Roseanne Arnold's 
withdrawal of her original divorce petition and was filed by a different 
attorney than the first time around. 
</P>
<P>
 In that April 18 filing, Arnold said she was a victim of "battered wife 
syndrome," maintaining that her husband had abused her throughout their 
four-year marriage. She stated that her husband "hit me, struck me, has thrown 
objects at me, pinched me and verbally abused me. He also has pushed me against 
walls, while he screams and shouts at me, drowning out any possible pleas that 
I might make for him to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days that followed the first filing, Tom Arnold repeatedly denied the 
accusations in several interviews, but acknowledged a strain in their 
relationship because of their respective heavy work schedules. He also denied 
rumors that the split had anything to do with a rumored affair with his 
assistant, Kim Silva. Arnold said he wanted a "healthy" reconciliation with his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after Roseanne Arnold filed the first petition, she retracted the 
action, dropped the abuse charges and publicly apologized to her husband and 
Silva "for letting outsiders, nasty gossip and lies finally break me down and 
leave me reeling. Tom never hurt my children, and often our fights in the past 
have led to physical action, which we both are learning to control." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as they said last time around, many in the entertainment industry 
speculated that the would-be split is another of the Arnolds' infamous 
publicity stunts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom" is struggling in the ratings and is not expected to be renewed for the 
fall season. "Roseanne" is still one of television's highest-rated programs, 
but fell below "Home Improvement" as television's most popular show. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the couple spent time in the Midwest. However, Roseanne 
Arnold recently left for Europe after her husband returned to Los Angeles.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MILKEN 
AGREES TO CANCEL VIDEO DEAL WITH UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young announced Friday that fallen junk bond king 
Michael Milken has agreed to cancel a controversial contract that allowed the 
convicted felon to use the Westwood school's name to sell videotapes of his MBA 
lectures last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA came under heavy criticism for its arrangement with Milken, the 
high-flying 1980s financier who was found guilty of six securities fraud 
violations.Under the contract with Milken's EEN Communications Network to 
produce the videotapes, UCLA waived its legal rights and allowed Milken to use 
its name in exchange for 5% of the profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Two state senators lambasted the idea of the contract and its provisions, and 
UC regents recently asked administrators to approach Milken to cancel the deal. 
Young said Friday that after amicable discussions, Milken agreed to release the 
school from the contract but that his company would proceed with the project 
and donate completed videotapes at each UC campus.

 La-La is great: While visiting Sweden, Times writer Bob Elston ran into a

 The hottest Occidental College grad?No, it's not Hall of Fame quarterback Jack 
Kemp, the Republican presidential hopeful. The alum recently featured in 
Occidental Magazine was Sammy Lee II -- the Beverly Hills police detective who 
helped bring about the arrest of accused madam Heidi Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who met Fleiss at a Beverly Hills club while posing as a wealthy Japanese 
businessman, was offered the services of some "full-service entertainment" by 
Fleiss for $1,500, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drove up in a Testarossa," Lee told the magazine. "If you drive up in a TR, 
you tend to get more respect than if you drive up in a Hyundai."

Smokey Bear just as it is Steve Harvey, not Steve the Harvey." Responds John 
Hamilton Scott: "What about Felix the Cat? Bullwinkle the Moose? Sam the Sham?"

 How do you show your appreciation for a former teacher in Beverly Hills? You 
name a sitcom character in his honor. Christopher Lloyd, an executive producer 
of TV's "Frasier," named the show's restaurant critic, Gil Chesterton, after 
his journalism teacher at Beverly Hills High. Charles Rosen, another 
ex-Chesterton pupil who's an executive producer of TV's "Beverly Hills 90210," 
also saluted his old teacher, giving the journalism instructor at the show's 
high school the first name of Gil.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CONFERENCE TO COVER CONCERNS OF MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 About 50,000 men are expected to attend a conference in Anaheim today that 
organizers say is aimed at uniting men from different religious and ethnic 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention at Anaheim Stadium is given by Promise Keepers, a 
Christian-based organization founded four years ago by Bill McCartney, head 
football coach at the University of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of men began arriving Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had nearly 45,000 (preregister), which is unheard of for men," said event 
spokesman Terry Duffy, who added that busloads of members of religious 
organizations were expected from the Bay Area, San Diego, Sacramento, Phoenix 
and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The participants will cover topics such as integrity and family and community 
involvement, said Randy Phillips, the president of Promise Keepers.  
</P>
<P>
 "America's moral foundation is crumbling today under the weight of broken 
promises, and this pressure is shattering marriages and creating widespread 
hurt and pain," Phillips said. "Men . . . can get so focused in the marketplace 
(and) can do it at the expense of the home," he added at a news conference held 
just before the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attendees who arrived early Friday evening said they want to be able to 
talk candidly with other men, learn to be better fathers and husbands, and 
strengthen their faith. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar convention last year in Boulder, Colo., attracted more than 50,000 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the first of such conferences around the country this year. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about tickets, which are $55, call (714) 999-8980. 
Arrangements can be made for those who cannot afford the ticket price, Duffy 
said.ELAINE TASSY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LOANS FOR FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS OFFERED 
</P>

 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown announced this week that about 240 residents in 
Orange and Los Angeles counties will be able to apply for $30 million in 
low-interest loans for their first homes as a result of an upcoming bond sale.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County residents qualify if they have never owned a home before, and if 
the value of the home they are buying is less than $225,900 for an existing 
home, or $242,190 for a new home, according to a state spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, applicants in households of one or two must make less than $57,800 
a year. For households of three or more, the combined income cannot be greater 
than $65,500, program administrator Mary Kittleson said.  
</P>
<P>
 The average income for those who use this program in Orange County is $43,702 
a year, based on a sampling of the last 250 loans, said Angel Bade, an 
administrative staff analyst with Orange County's public finance division. 
</P>
<P>
 The loans typically are between $150,000 and $200,000, with the purchaser 
responsible for the difference, Bade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the program began 10 years ago, $415 million has been issued in Orange 
and Los Angeles counties, according to Charles Taylor, a manager at the 
Southern California Home Financing Authority, which administers the program. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, Orange County residents can call Bade at (714) 834-5693.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; KING'S 
LAWYERS BARRED FROM ALLEGING RACIAL SLURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The judge in the trial of a lawsuit stemming from Rodney G. King's beating 
barred King's lawyers Friday from claiming in closing arguments that the 
officers at the scene used racial slurs.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think, in fairness, you must have evidence that one of these officers" 
uttered such words, U.S. District Judge John G. Davies said."It will not be 
referred to in closing arguments."  
</P>
<P>
 The decision was a setback for King's lawyers, who called experts during the 
first phase of the lawsuit to testify about whether racial epithets were made 
by the officers who beat King. The first phase resulted in a $3.8-million 
judgment for King against the city of Los Angeles. However, in the current 
phase of the trial, in which King is seeking punitive damages from individual 
officers, his attorneys have not emphasized the issue of slurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Final arguments are scheduled to begin Monday. The jury is expected to begin 
deliberating late Monday or early Tuesday.

 A drive-by shooting in the Venice area has left two teen-agers wounded.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COUNCIL TO EVALUATE JULY 4 BEER BOOTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday will discuss whether the Lions Club will continue 
to operate two beer booths along the Fourth of July parade route. 
</P>
<P>
 "These beer booths are a major fund-raiser for the Lion's Club and have been 
permitted with a one-day ABC (state Alcoholic Beverage Control) permit," said 
Ron Hagan, the city's director of community services. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan, in a memo to the City Council, noted that the Huntington Beach Downtown 
Residents Assn. "believes the city should set an example that open alcohol 
consumption on the Fourth of July will not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
 The downtown organization has charged that the "party riots" last July 4 
stemmed partly from easy access to liquor. Police rounded up scores of young 
people in the downtown area that night, accusing them of lighting bonfires in 
the street and destroying neighborhood property. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the association's contention that alcohol consumption is hard enough to 
control from just the sales points of markets and liquor stores and that 
outdoor beer booths add to the party atmosphere and serve to encourage alcohol 
consumption on the Fourth of July," Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He offered an alternative. He said that if the council still wants to allow 
the Lions Club to operate the beer booths, the booths should be more closely 
regulated and should be reviewed by the city's zoning administrator each year.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; REMORSEFUL INMATE SENDS DOCTOR A NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. John Lehman received a surprise in his mailbox this week: a letter of 
apology from a bank robbery suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, written from the Federal Detention Center in Los Angeles by 
37-year-old Walter Lewis, began: 
</P>
<P>
 "Doc, I'm writing you this letter to say that I apologize. . . . I've been 
sitting here thinking about you and I feel real BAD. . . . Sometimes in life 
people don't think, and I didn't think." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who was being chased by police, burst in Lehman's fourth-floor office 
on April 27, asking for a place to hide. The Compton resident, who was unarmed, 
was suspected of robbing a Wells Fargo Bank in Orange earlier that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had followed Lewis and an accomplice, 29-year-old Maurice Ronae Bowman, 
from Orange to the medical center complex in the 1500 block of 17th Street. 
Lewis jumped out of the car and ran into the building; Bowman was arrested in 
the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than an hour, as police conducted a floor-by-floor search of the 
five-story building, a nervous Lewis sat in an examining room with Lehman, 75. 
He told the veteran dermatologist and the physician's 39-year-old receptionist 
daughter, Jackie Lehman, that he had shot a friend during a dispute over money 
and was hiding from police. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those anxious moments, Lewis wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in your office, I almost started to cry. . . . My mother didn't 
raise me this way and I just got myself into something that I must pay for." 
</P>
<P>
 Before surrendering to police, Lewis gave the doctor an envelope filled with 
cash and begged Lehman to send it to his wife. The doctor later turned the cash 
over to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who has not yet gone to trial, also wrote: "Let's just look at it as 
something funny, like a storybook! Something that you'll be able to tell your 
grandchildren one day. And I'll be able to tell mine about the great man I 
met." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Lehman said he was "unfazed" by the experience and said he has 
developed a soft spot in his heart for Lewis, who he said was unfailingly 
polite during their encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman said he didn't feel threatened during the time Lewis was in his office, 
adding that he encouraged Lewis to turn himself in to police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I might send him a note," said Lehman, who has been in practice for 
more than 40 years. "I hope he doesn't get too bad a sentence and can get his 
life together again. He didn't seem like your typical bank robber." GREG

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; FIRE DEPT. CONSIDERS AMBULANCE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that could generate substantial revenue, the Fire Department may 
join a growing number of fire departments in providing ambulance service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department may propose to take over ambulance service contracts held 
by Southland LifeFleet Inc. of Newport Beach, say city fire officials.City 
officials have labeled such moves as "reverse privatization." 
</P>
<P>
 But officials of the ambulance service said they will oppose the move. 
</P>
<P>
 They say Fire Department predictions about high revenue are unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambulance companies like LifeFleet write off as much as 40% of their business 
because users are unable to pay for the service, said Jane Duffy, LifeFleet's 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities really need to look at that figure and see if they could collect that 
amount. Collection is very costly," Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
 LifeFleet has provided ambulance service to Anaheim for more than 30 years. 
Its their recent annual net revenue ranged between $1.4 million and $1.6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city considers a Fire Department ambulance proposal, it should have a 
study to detail the potential costs to taxpayers, said Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to studies in other cities, fire departments can add several hundred 
thousand dollars in revenue by assuming ambulance services. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; STRESSING IMPORTANCE OF READING TO KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health-care professionals read aloud to elementary school children Friday, 
stressing the importance of education during "Medical Read Aloud Day," a PTA 
program at Paularino Elementary School that brings working adults together with 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, judges, lawyers and law clerks visited from Municipal Court in 
Newport Beach to talk with students about legal careers. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP Inc.'s office in Costa Mesa joined in a business partnership with the 
school at 1060 Paularino Ave., after an administrator toured the school in 
March, said Principal Brooke Booth. The health-care firm sent about 15 nurses 
and other workers to the school Friday and donated a new fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Rotondi, a reception supervisor for a Costa Mesa health-care center run 
by FHP Inc., read to third-graders in Karlena Kraft's class. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the time to learn to read well, so you can get the jobs you want," 
Kraft told the students. Reading from an illustrated children's medical book 
called "Your Insides," she asked the students to identify pictures of bones, 
arteries and muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 Aleem Mohammed, 8, said his favorite part of the presentation was the X-rays 
of hands, feet and skulls that Rotondi passed around. Mohammed recalled that he 
could have cracked his own skull recently when he fell off his bike, but was 
unharmed because he was wearing a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Kraft said her students already like to read, but it helps to have 
professionals speak up for the importance of reading skills because the message 
comes from "somebody who is really involved and working -- other than their 
parents and teachers," Kraft said. 
</P>
<P>
 But parents also do their part. Kraft said parents do not allow many of her 
students to watch more than 30 minutes of television each day. That helps, 
Kraft said, because the students then turn to books for stories. 
</P>
<P>
 And when students recently read the story "Stone Fox," and then saw the movie 
version, most of them enjoyed the book more, Kraft said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book had more action in it; it was better," said 9-year-old Jonathan 
Powell of the book, which described a young boy's attempts to run a farm.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; BUS-TRUCK ACCIDENT ON FREEWAY INJURES 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bus rear-ended a pickup on Interstate 5 on Friday, causing minor injuries to 
three people. 
</P>
<P>
 A California Highway Patrol spokesman said that bus driver Arthur Frost, 37, 
was heading south on the freeway, just north of Crown Valley Parkway, in heavy 
traffic shortly before noon when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver of the bus said he was in stop-and-go traffic, going about 20 
miles per hour. He went to hit the brake pedal and missed," CHP spokesman Bruce 
Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority bus slammed into the back of a 
pickup driven by Patrick Daley, 31, of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Daley complained of pain and was transported to Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo. Two passengers on the bus who said they were 
hurt in the accident also were taken to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officers closed off the right lane on the freeway for about an hour. The 
freeway lane was reopened in time for the evening rush-hour traffic.

AL MARTINEZ: ADRIFT IN A CITY OF DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone knows we're a city of dreams. People come to L.A. from all over the 
country with bundles of hope tucked under their arms, waiting for the spotlight 
to swing their way and bring them the fame they dreamed about back in Omaha or 
Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
 The bundles I'm talking about are screenplays. About 27,000 are registered 
each year with the Writers Guild by people who believe they've got a story to 
tell and there's no better place to tell it than on a big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Damned few screenplays ever get produced, but that's OK. Every man or woman 
who gets off a Greyhound bus from back somewhere has heard about those who do 
make it, bringing new writers thousands of dollars in cash and first-class 
tickets to Paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 I get asked a lot to talk to people who've written scripts or to read their 
works, and most of the time I say no. I don't know enough about writing to give 
advice. But every once in awhile I'm reeled in like a fat trout by bait too 
tempting to ignore. That's why I bring you Josephine. 
</P>
<P>
 I was introduced to her by Chaplain Telly Miller of the L.A. Mission, a place 
littered with dreams that never made it. He said he knew a woman who used to be 
a lawyer and was now on the streets, not because of booze or drugs but because 
of conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened, he said, was she represented a man back in Michigan who, after 
she'd won his case, went out and raped someone. She was so traumatized by it 
that she gave up her practice and headed west. She was living in a homeless 
shelter and trying to write for the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 It had column written all over it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I met her at a Skid Row coffee shop called Tony's. She's a handsome, 
50-year-old woman who looks nothing like the occupant of a homeless shelter. 
Her bright red dress and dangling gold earrings stood out in blinding contrast 
to otherwise drab surroundings. Her manner was anything but that of a drifter. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's name is Josephine. She didn't want to be identified, but did want 
to talk about her screenplay, which is about an old guy with dreams of his own 
who makes them come true. 
</P>
<P>
 I was surprised when I read the treatment. I thought it would be her story, 
the tale of a woman lawyer so torn up and guilt-ridden by the subsequent crimes 
of the man she saves from prison that she melts into the shadows to hide from 
her conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 But when I asked her about it, she said she didn't even want to discuss that 
part of her life. All she was interested in doing was having me help her raise 
$5,000 to pay a man who was going to produce her movie. He needed it, she said, 
to hire someone to arrange financing for the film. 
</P>
<P>
 I never heard of that before but warned her not to give money to anyone. "The 
town's full of barracudas who'll eat you alive given half a chance," I said. 
But I could tell by the look on her face she wasn't about to listen to me. 
There is no logic to a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Josephine isn't stupid. She was raised in a good family, attended private 
schools and has a master's degree from a Midwestern university. In the late 
1970s, she was the first black person ever appointed to the staff of a state's 
legislative leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of chances to do a lot of things," she told me that day at 
Tony's. "This is what I want to do. It makes me feel alive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring efforts to get her to talk about her last legal case, Josephine said 
a divorce and the death of her parents finally drove her to asking God what she 
ought to do. He said she ought to write a screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 You've got to listen to God, I guess, so she wrote the script whose treatment 
I saw, about the old man. Then she came West, to San Francisco first, where she 
worked at Macy's and then to L.A., packing her dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs aren't all that easy to come by down here. Josephine ended up serving 
meals and sweeping floors in an old folks' home and trying to sell her script. 
She finally found the producer who wants $5,000, and that's where she is now. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure why she won't write her own story. I don't even know if it's 
true. Fantasy has a way of emerging as reality in the town where illusion was 
born. Telly Miller believes her, and I suppose that's good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of our conversation, Josephine said she'd call me in two weeks, but 
she never did. Maybe all she ever wanted from me was a way to get to the five 
grand, but I sure as hell am not into raising money for someone who says he 
needs it to produce a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's what it takes to buy yourself a tomorrow, hold off, Josephine. I'm 
sure if you wait long enough the price is bound to come down. Bargains abound 
in the City of Dreams.

BONES IN YARD PROVE TO BE ANIMALS'; INVESTIGATION: NEW REMAINS UNEARTHED AT 
HOME WHERE DISMEMBERED HUMAN SKELETON WAS FOUND TURN OUT TO BE THOSE OF A HORSE 
AND A CHICKEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Swimming pool excavators unearthed more skeletal remains in the back yard of a 
San Marino home Friday, but this time the victim was probably a horse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the latest find was made 
shortly before noon Friday, just a few hours after detectives had cleared the 
site and allowed a resumption of the pool construction work behind the spacious 
home on Lorain Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, contractor Jose Perez dug up what investigators said were three 
plastic bags containing the bones of a single adult human. Detectives said the 
victim "may have been a previous resident missing since 1985." 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino police said there actually were two residents of the Lorain road 
home on whom missing person reports were filed in 1985 -- Jonathan Sohus and 
his wife, Linda Sohus, both in their late 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 So it did not come as that great a surprise when the Sheriff's Department 
announced Friday that a second set of skeletal remains "that appear to be 
human" had been found. Homicide investigators were dispatched to the scene, 
followed, as usual, by news reporters and a crowd of curious neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 When coroner's deputies got there, they said the latest victim appeared to be 
equine. The unearthed bone, they said, was probably a leg bone from a horse. 
Further digging later turned up a few chicken bones, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Raymond H. Peavy said the the Sohus family "had a habit of 
barbecuing and burying trash in the back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 That explains the chicken, and maybe even the horse, but it does little to 
unravel the mystery of the missing couple and the identity of the human remains 
found last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office said Friday that examination by anthropologists has shown 
that the skeleton was that of a single victim, an adult male. Investigators 
said it is hoped that dental records will soon reveal whether the adult male 
was Jonathan Sohus. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the victim does turn out to be him, the whereabouts of his wife will 
remain a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 The missing person reports were filed by Jonathan's adoptive mother, Ruth 
(DiDi) Sohus, who lived with him and his wife, Linda, in the Lorain Road home 
at the time of their disappearance. Ruth Sohus told police that the couple left 
on a trip to Europe and simply vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Sohus died several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth's last husband, Bob Sohus -- who moved out and divorced her several years 
before the couple vanished -- said earlier this week that police questioned him 
extensively about the disappearance and about his former wife, but he was 
unable to provide much information. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked me if I thought she could have done it," Bob Sohus said. "I told 
them yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jonathan taking off (on the trip to Europe) was a big rejection in her mind," 
Bob Sohus said. "And she couldn't stand rejection."  
</P>
<P>
 Sohus said police also asked him about a young man who was renting an 
apartment at the back of the Lorain Road home when the couple disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he did not know the man, but others questioned by police said officers 
told them that the man, thought to have been a student at Pasadena City 
College, had used several aliases and had been in trouble with the law. They 
said officers told them they do not know where the man is. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said the current residents of the Lorain Road property -- Ray 
Parada and his wife -- are not suspects in the case. The Paradas moved in when 
Ruth Sohus sold the house, a few months after the couple disappeared.

ANTI-GANG PROGRAM FACES FIGHT FOR FUNDS; BUDGET: HOPE IN YOUTH'S ORGANIZERS 
WANT THE CITY TO DOUBLE ITS CONTRIBUTION TO $5 MILLION. COUNCIL IS DIVIDED ON 
THE YEAR-OLD GROUP'S EFFECTIVENESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A priest and a team of social workers came to Los Angeles City Hall recently 
to describe a program that they say is the best hope for reducing the city's 
scourge of gangs and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they were gone, leaving behind their request for $5 million, the 
organizers of the Hope in Youth program were being praised by some officials as 
visionaries and damned by others as arrogant and intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight over whether the church-based anti-gang program will get its money 
looms as the biggest remaining battle confronting Mayor Richard Riordan's 
$4.3-billion municipal budget. On Monday or Tuesday, the City Council is 
expected to decide whether to double funding for the program in just its second 
year, as Riordan promised he would when he was running for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Most council members have signaled that they will support Riordan in his main 
budget proposal of expanding the Police Department and vote to postpone his 
plans to consolidate several city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fate of Hope in Youth is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was launched a year ago when nine religious denominations and four 
community activist groups proposed flooding the county's most downtrodden 
neighborhoods with 480 social workers. Organized into 160 three-person teams, 
the workers would try to find activities for young people and work with school 
officials and parents to offer support and guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope in Youth's boosters, who include Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, had unusual 
success last year in attracting financial support for an unproven, fledgling 
program. The city gave $2.5 million, the county more than $2.9 million and the 
state $2 million, for a total of $7.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investment is so insignificant, compared to the end result," said 
Councilman Richard Alatorre, the top booster for the program on the City 
Council. "It costs a lot less to do this on the front end than on the back end 
. . . by discouraging people (from) getting into the juvenile justice system or 
being wards of the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents such as Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas say Hope in Youth is 
untested and is being given more money than any other anti-gang effort in the 
city, despite its lack of a track record. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do we justify giving $5 million to this unproven group when there are so 
many other groups that ought to have the opportunity to compete for the money?" 
Ridley-Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials monitoring Hope in Youth said they have not been able to gauge 
whether the program is achieving its goals because the group has not laid out a 
set of criteria that can be measured. Some have said this means that the 
program has not complied with its contract with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel they don't have to do the same mundane things that other programs 
have to do," said one official, who asked not to be identified.  
</P>
<P>
 Greg Fitzgerald, the project's director, vehemently denied that the group has 
been uncooperative. He said the first social workers only completed their 
training and began work in April and that there has not been enough time to 
summarize the nearly 14,000 contacts they have made with teen-agers, parents 
and school officials. A computer program is being designed to aid in the work, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-four Hope in Youth teams have been hired and 10 took to the field in 
April. The $30,000-a-year social workers are organizing teen-agers and adults 
in four Los Angeles neighborhoods, two Pasadena neighborhoods and neighborhoods 
in Altadena, Baldwin Park, Compton and Pomona, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a debate before a City Council committee last week, city overseers and the 
program's directors could not agree whether Hope in Youth has provided adequate 
information to the city. The sharp exchange ended with Lou Negrete, chairman of 
the Hope in Youth campaign, accusing city officials of "sandbagging" the 
funding request. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Hope in Youth's lobbying has been directed at state and local 
government officials. But this spring, they persuaded Rep. Matthew G. Martinez 
(D-Monterey Park) to attach an amendment to the federal crime bill that would 
give programs like Hope in Youth a total of up to $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill must receive final approval and then separate legislation is needed 
to appropriate the money before Los Angeles can compete with other cities for 
the funds. Hope in Youth organizers are banking on connections with the Clinton 
Administration to bring a lion's share of the funds back to Los Angeles, 
according to one source.

CHOICE OF DOG LICENSING COMPANY QUESTIONED; FINANCE: SUIT IS THREATENED OVER 
CITY'S SHIFT TO A NEW FIRM RUN BY A MAN WHO WAS FIRED BY THE PREVIOUS 
CONTRACTOR FOR ALLEGEDLY MISSPENDING FEDERAL FUNDS. WINNER SAYS CONTRACT WAS 
GAINED FAIRLY.

<P>
 The city of Los Angeles last month awarded a $300,000 dog licensing contract 
to a company that did not exist at the time of the award and will be run by a 
man fired by the previous contractor for allegedly misspending $500,000 in 
federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's shift of the contract last month from Mid-Valley Manpower 
Consortium, an El Monte-based nonprofit job training program, to Timely 
Concepts Inc., has drawn protests from Mid-Valley, which has appealed the award 
and is threatening to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is going from a tried and true contractor which has performed 
admirably for eight years to a company with no employees, no track record and 
no experience," said Mid-Valley's attorney, Michael Colantuono. "We think the 
taxpayers of the city are entitled to ask why." 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-Valley's contract was up for renewal in April but it lost out to Timely 
Concepts, which was represented by Douglas Shaw, Mid-Valley's former executive 
director. The contract involves going door to door to see whether residents 
have licensed pets and offering renewals if they lack the licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, 51, was dismissed last year by Mid-Valley for alleged misuse of $500,000 
in federal funds. He is under criminal investigation by the U.S. Labor 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Colantuono claimed that the fledgling company won the bid by relying on Shaw's 
insider information and his personal relationships with two department 
employees who were on the three-person team that ranked the bidders. 
Incorporation papers dated April 28 show that Timely Concepts did not legally 
exist when it got the city contract April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Department of Animal Regulation would not comment on the 
contract award. But in a letter to Mid-Valley, Gary Olsen, the department's 
general manager, said none of the three raters were biased or had a 
relationship with Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis McGorman, co-owner of Timely Concepts, insists that his company, though 
new, won the contract fairly by hiring experienced consultants such as Shaw and 
Sol Belinky, who also has run a door-to-door dog license canvassing program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that was our weak point in our proposal, us being a new company, 
hence the reason for retaining Doug Shaw's expertise," McGorman said. The 
company expects to hire up to seven employees by the contract start date, June 
16, and expand to 30 later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Timely Concepts delayed incorporating until after it secured the city contract 
to avoid paying more than $2,000 in business fees unnecessarily, said the 
company's attorney, Leon Katz. The attorney said delaying incorporation is a 
common practice. 
</P>
<P>
 McGorman said he and another businessman, Mario Cardenas, were approached by 
Shaw and Belinky to start up the commercial dog licensing business. Shaw does 
not handle financial matters for the new company but will provide operational 
help, McGorman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, it's my belief that the man is entitled to earn a living," 
McGorman said. Federal investigators declined to comment on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw was dismissed May 12, 1993, after 15 years with Mid-Valley, when a county 
audit revealed that he had misspent money by paying the salaries of two 
Bradbury city employees over seven years and by purchasing personal items with 
Mid-Valley funds. Also, $300,000 was unaccounted for in Mid-Valley accounts.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PIONEER RECREATION AREA STAFFER RETIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first National Park Service employee in the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation Area retired this month, 15 years after he helped establish 
a park that stretches from Griffith Park to Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 William Webb, 60, who served as assistant superintendent of the recreation 
area, said the toughest part of his job was the first park's initial few months 
in 1979, when he and former Supt. Robert Chandler faced opposition from many 
residents of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came into a place where a lot of people didn't understand the intent of a 
park," Webb said. "They thought we were coming in to buy up all the homes. We 
had to talk to a lot of people and let them know that we looked at them as good 
neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the arrival in 1979 of Webb and Chandler, who left several years after 
the park was established, the park staff has grown from two to about 80 and the 
National Park Service has bought 21,000 acres of land for public use. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said some of his most cherished moments in the park include the visits of 
children from East and South-Central Los Angeles. Some of the youngsters had 
never left their neighborhoods before. 
</P>
<P>
 "The excitement that comes across the faces of those schoolkids is something," 
Webb said. "A lot of them would not have the opportunity to go to larger parks. 
So this is their Yosemite or their Sequoia." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb retired on May 3, after 30 years in the National Park Service. His tenure 
included a post as general superintendent for the Virgin Islands National Park 
Group. He plans to move to Kentucky in September with his wife, Caroleen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hate losing this man," said National Park Service spokeswoman Jean Bray. 
"Not only was he the continuity from the first days of the recreation area, but 
he was involved with all the outside organizations and added good character to 
the park." KURT PITZER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; ATTORNEY'S BENEFITS RESCINDED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dana Point City Council this week rescinded its policy of paying 
retirement benefits for City Atty. Jerry Patterson. The action was at his 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy, which was approved on a 4-1 vote Tuesday night, also prohibits 
the city from paying any retirement benefits for future city attorneys who, 
like Patterson, are independent contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to restudy the issue after a former city traffic 
commissioner last month called for Patterson's resignation for accepting city 
funds for retirement, despite the fact he is not a city employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, a former Orange County congressman whose wife is running for county 
supervisor, has collected more than $6,000 from the city for retirement and 
would have collected $10,584 during the next fiscal year under the old policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits are paid to the Public Employees Retirement System, or PERS, a 
statewide system based in Sacramento that covers about 1 million active members 
and retirees from public agencies and school systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson has been on the PERS system for 17 years, dating back to when he was 
a member of the Santa Ana City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, who has been city attorney since Dana Point incorporated in 1989, 
works for the Costa Mesa-based Burke, Williams & Sorensen law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 He began collecting benefits from the city last October and, prior to that, 
had been collecting benefits as a city attorney in Cypress and from a faculty 
position at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Stephen B. Julian said the council action was proposed by 
Patterson himself "to clear the air." Patterson has already given the city a 
cash payment for the year's worth of benefits, Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman William L. Ossenmacher voted against the action, although he 
said it was a good step. LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; JURY: LINES DID NOT HURT HOMES' VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case watched closely by the utility industry, an Orange County jury 
decided Friday that the values of three San Clemente homes have plummeted 
because of the recession, not because of high-voltage power lines running 
alongside the properties, as the owners had said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though neither side expects a reversal of that verdict, Superior Court Judge 
James R. Ross is scheduled to make a final ruling on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which was heard in Superior Court in Fullerton, began in November, 
1992, when a group of Mariner's Point homeowners sued San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co. in what has become a new twist to the decades-old controversy over the 
purported health risk of high-voltage power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than contending that electromagnetic fields emitted by the power lines 
caused health problems, the homeowners said that the power lines destroyed 
their property values by scaring off potential buyers who fear there may be a 
link between the electromagnetic emissions and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Health concerns were raised in the Mariner's Point neighborhood in 1990, when 
SDG&E added four power lines to the seven already running alongside the 
properties. SDG&E officials acknowledge that the new lines increased the 
capacity for more current, hence a stronger electromagnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the homeowners filed their lawsuit, utility industry officials 
nationwide have been worried that a victory in the case might unleash a torrent 
of similar "property value" cases against power companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, all but six of the original 24 plaintiffs dropped out of 
the case, leaving Mark and Cheryl McCartin, Raymond Dean and Eleanor Moore, and 
Dave and Sandra Lammert to fight the utility company. 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdict Friday, the McCartins, who have four children, said they 
don't expect Ross to reverse the jury's decision. But they added that they are 
hopeful the judge will force SDG&E to move the power lines or to spend about 
$80,000 to reconfigure them so as to reduce the magnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed with the decision," said Mark McCartin, an emergency 
room physician with Kaiser Permanente who bought his $730,000, bluff-top home 
in 1989. "We're just hoping the power company will begin to take into account 
health and property value concerns before new power lines are installed." 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiff's attorney, Michael Withey, said he would appeal "any adverse 
ruling" from the judge on Monday. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors heard testimony from real estate, physics and health experts called by 
both sides. They were instructed by Ross to vote on nine critical questions. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the questions was whether the addition of the four power lines in 
effect rendered the homes worthless, or diminished their value. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a growing perception now of health risks associated with 
power lines, but as far as the argument they can't sell their homes . . . most 
of us felt that was just a result of the recession," said one of the jurors, 
Benjamin Boer, 28, of Fullerton. "In fact, a lot of us felt we would buy any of 
the homes if we had that kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
 SDG&E officials maintain that the electric current that runs through the power 
lines in the San Clemente neighborhood carries the same 12,000 volts "that runs 
down every neighborhood street." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely nothing unique about (the homeowners') situation except 
that they have a view of the Pacific on one side and Camp Pendleton on the 
other, with nothing to spoil the view of that except some power lines," said 
Greg Barnes, an SDG&E attorney. ANDREW LePAGE

 Three landscape architects will share the job of caring for Thousand Oaks' 
namesake trees, working together to keep the city green. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura resident George Moore, who has served as Thousand Oaks' sole tree 
protector for nearly a decade, will now split his duties with two friends: 
local landscape architects John Innes and Richard Campbell. Each consultant 
will earn $50 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have three individuals who are equally qualified and we might as well 
increase our flexibility" by having all three on call with consulting 
contracts, principal planner Paul Metrovitsch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrovitsch, who interviewed 10 candidates for the job before selecting the 
finalists, said the city would rotate work among the three. STEPHANIE SIMON

<P>
 The Tall Club of Orange County is holding its annual volleyball tournament 
today in Costa Mesa to raise money to fight an unusual genetic disorder that 
can be fatal in tall people. 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth annual fund-raiser at TeWinkle Memorial Park is designed to 
increase awareness of Marfan syndrome, which affects connective tissue and 
causes people to grow tall and disproportionately lanky. 
</P>
<P>
 Flo Hyman, a key player of the U.S. women's volleyball team that won the 
Olympic silver medal in 1984, died of Marfan syndrome about eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting a lot of help from the tall clubs to get up awareness," 
Patricia Kraft, assistant director of the National Marfan Foundation, based in 
New York. 
</P>

DEMOCRATS SQUABBLE IN RACE FOR DORNAN'S SEAT; POLITICS: TWO CANDIDATES JOIN 
FORCES TO CRITICIZE CAMPAIGN TACTICS OF A THIRD, WHO SAYS HE IS BEING ATTACKED 
BECAUSE HE'S THE FRONT-RUNNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of the six Democrats running for the seat held by Rep. Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove) joined forces at a news conference Friday to criticize the 
campaign tactics of businessman Mike Farber, another Democratic candidate in 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates Robert Banuelos of Santa Ana and John M. Ivler of Los Alamitos 
accused Farber of touting political endorsements that he did not really have; 
of allegedly violating the state Transportation Department's guidelines that 
prohibit posting campaign signs on or near freeways; and of removing Ivler's 
campaign posters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Farber campaign later responded that Farber was attacked because he is 
the front-runner in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of Banuelos' complaint was a flyer distributed by Farber at a 
recent Cinco de Mayo celebration. The flyer included a photo of state Sen. Art 
Torres (D-Los Angeles) with the quote: "Mike Farber is a superb candidate for 
Congress and a good friend . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Banuelos said he was surprised because he had received Torres' endorsement 
earlier this year and reaffirmed in March at the local Democratic Party 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took pictures together shaking hands," Banuelos said of the recent meeting 
with Torres. 
</P>
<P>
 The Farber campaign responded that its flyer was legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Torres) gave us the picture and he gave us the quote and he said go ahead 
and use the piece," Farber campaign spokeswoman Shawnda Westly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides produced a list of witnesses who had spoken to Torres and could 
verify their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, who is running for state insurance commissioner, called for an end to 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released Friday by his campaign manager, the senator reaffirmed 
his endorsement of Banuelos, and added: "Either one of these candidates will 
make an excellent replacement for Bob Dornan. As Democrats, it's important we 
focus our energies on retiring Dornan from the U.S. Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivler, meanwhile, presented the statements of two women who said they 
witnessed two men removing Ivler's campaign signs and replacing them with 
Farber's. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a candidate can't control their staff of volunteers, how can they be 
expected to run a congressional office?" Ivler said. "No other candidate has 
these cowboys out on the street breaking the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Westly said they spoke to the volunteer who was seen removing Ivler's sign and 
the situation was corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the way we will run our campaign," Westly said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Democrats seeking the nomination in the June 7 primary are 
businesswoman Madelene E. Arakelian, Placentia Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode and 
engineer Don Payne.

 Out in the California desert, George and Marian Kurash were scanning the 
ground when they stumbled upon a slice of history. 
</P>
<P>
 George Kurash, a retired geologist and avid rock collector from Thousand Oaks, 
reached down to examine an intriguing specimen when he noticed the peculiar 
indentations of a fish in the side of the rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had spent hours out there when we spotted the fossils," Marian Kurash 
recalled. "We couldn't have been more happy if we'd found a million dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a chance find -- a fossil that George Kurash estimates is 11 million to 
13 million years old -- but it is discoveries such as these that have hooked 
the Kurashes and about 100 other Conejo Valley residents on rocks. 
</P>

 They dub themselves "rock hounds." For 20 years they've lugged several tons of 
rocks, fossils, gems and minerals into their Thousand Oaks homes to be 
transformed into dazzling specimens of earth's beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend they will show off their collections at the Conejo Gem & Mineral 
Club's "Pageant of a Thousand Gems." 
</P>
<P>
 But the show reveals only a glimpse of what collecting is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Every month, groups of rock hounds, ranging in age from 5 to 90, venture 
around California's deserts, lakes and caves known for their deposits of prime 
rock specimens. 
</P>
<P>
 When they arrive at the prearranged stone-hunting sites, the rock hounds 
abandon their campers and walk over the land, eyes trained on the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll always be able to tell the rock hound because his head is always 
down," said Bob Stultz, president of the Conejo Gem & Mineral Club. "We could 
walk right by you and we wouldn't even know you were there." 
</P>
<P>
 Concentration is a necessity, Stultz said, because to the untrained eye, the 
rocks that hold most gems and minerals look no different from any other. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first went out on a field trip we were trying to find agate for a full 
day without any success," Stultz said. "Then one of the experienced rock hounds 
came up to us and with one swing of his hammer, presto. There it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, Stultz is more accustomed to the look of a valuable stone. In 
his home, drawers and shelves overflow with collections drawn on years of 
journeys that he and his wife Jeane -- a past president of the club -- have 
taken all across the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Stultz's current fascination is with a rock called Smithsonite, a colorful 
mineral that comes from copper mines in Arizona, Greece and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 In boxes piled high in his living room, Stultz packs away the various stones 
-- some so tiny they can only be seen with magnification and others that take 
up a good portion of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 In one cabinet, he keeps the flakes and chunks of gold he has collected while 
prospecting, one of dozens of rock-related activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold prospecting, Stultz concedes, is not as romantic as it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "On one trip to a river in Northern California we found only three flakes of 
gold for a whole week's work," Stultz said. "You don't do this to get rich, you 
just do it because the thrill of finding something gets in your blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Club members compare the thrill of finding a particularly rare or beautiful 
sample to fishing or gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's truly addictive," Marian Kurash said. "When you find something it's just 
exhilarating." 
</P>
<P>
 But Marian Kurash said it is the joy of the hunt that keeps her interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love being out in nature, walking through parts of the country I would 
never have gotten to see," she said. "You just never know what you're going to 
find. It's an adventure every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Since she began collecting rocks in 1985, Marian Kurash has found herself in 
situations she could scarcely have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 On a trip to Searles Lake, which is opened only one day a year for rock 
hounds, Marian Kurash recalled standing waist deep in muck, feeling beneath the 
water and mud for raspberry halite -- a dazzling white rock with pink crystal 
formations. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got one I realized it was so big I didn't know if I could carry it," 
she said. "My husband asked me if I wanted help, but I wanted to get it on my 
own. When I finally got it out, I felt like I had really accomplished 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the rocks are gathered, collectors use lapidary equipment to grind, 
polish and shape the stones. With a little work, Marian Kurash can turn a piece 
of hematite -- a dull black rock -- into something resembling a shiny black 
pearl. 
</P>
<P>
 George Kurash said that while some people make jewelry, there are dozens of 
options on how to treat a rock. 
</P>
<P>
 In his living room, he proudly displays a sandstone tablet bearing lines and 
shadings that resemble a desert scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of thing rock hounds do," he said as he held up the 
sandstone tablet. "They find natural things and they enhance them until they're 
beautiful." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Gem & Mineral Show, featuring exhibits of gems and minerals from 
California, as well as demonstrations, door prizes and a silent auction, will 
be held 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. today and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday at Borchard 
Park Community Center, 190 Reino Road, in Newbury Park. Admission and parking 
are free.

WOMAN RABBI TO HEAD TEMPLE EMANUEL; JUDAISM: SELECTION OF LAURA GELLER, WHICH 
TAKES EFFECT AUG. 1, MAKES THE SYNAGOGUE THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY TO HAVE A 
FEMALE LEADER. 
</P>

<P>
 In a move that is being hailed as a first, a large Westside synagogue has 
chosen a woman to be its senior rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Laura Geller, who has spoken out against racism, joined in a women's 
interfaith coalition to help rape victims in Bosnia and campaigned for abortion 
rights, will be the first woman to head Temple Emanuel of Beverly Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 Her appointment, which begins Aug. 1, would make Temple Emanuel the largest 
urban congregation in the country to be served by a woman, said Rabbi Lennard 
R. Thal, regional director of the Pacific Southwest Council of the Union of 
American Hebrew Congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the largest Reform synagogue to be led by a woman rabbi has been a 
600-member Boston congregation, Thal said. Temple Emanuel has 800 to 850 
families. (The largest congregation locally is Wilshire Boulevard Temple, with 
about 2,500 families.) 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a significant development," Thal said. "There are some who have said 
there is a glass ceiling for women clergy in the synagogue world. I'm not sure 
I agree. But if there has been a glass ceiling, I'd guess she'll need some 
bandages because she just broke it." 
</P>
<P>
 Geller, 44, was the third woman to be ordained in Reform Judaism, in 1976. She 
has been executive director of the Pacific Southwest Region of the American 
Jewish Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Corwin, president-elect of the temple, called the selection of its first 
woman rabbi a "historic moment for Judaism in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Corwin acknowledged that Geller faces a formidable task. "The recent past of 
Temple Emanuel has been a fractious one," he said. "We need somebody to come in 
fast to heal us and make us feel good about the place and to help us grow."  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Rabbi Stephen M. Robbins resigned as senior rabbi after 10 
years of service when disputes arose between him and members of the 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 One dispute involved a proposal to merge the financially troubled congregation 
with Wilshire Boulevard Temple. It was rejected by Temple Emanuel congregants, 
269 to 243. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Harvey J. Fields, senior rabbi at Wilshire Boulevard Temple, who favored 
the merger, called Geller's unanimous selection a good sign for the 
congregation. "I think Laura is a very able rabbi. She has a past of fine 
leadership and has been particularly a leader in the area of women's issues and 
has been socially active in the area of communal concerns," Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
 As director of the Westside office of the American Jewish Committee, she 
joined with the Muslim Women's League and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles to form the Women's Coalition Against Ethnic Cleansing to aid rape 
victims and send relief supplies and volunteers to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Geller also was active in a coalition of Hollywood abortion-rights activists.

FROM SAVING SOULS TO SOCIAL ACTIVISM; COMMUNITIES: ONCE-INSULAR EVANGELICAL AND 
PENTECOSTAL CHURCHES ARE BRANCHING OUT INTO PROGRAMS AIMED AT HELPING THE POOR 
AND FIGHTING URBAN ILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of the tumultuous riots that rocked Los Angeles two years ago, 
evangelical and Pentecostal churches have emerged as major players in shaping a 
new and pragmatic religious response to urban problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Long relegated to the fringes of the city's political life and viewed as far 
more concerned with saving souls than with social action, these once-insular 
churches are establishing anti-gang, job training, neighborhood development and 
a host of other inner-city programs once thought to be the exclusive purview of 
old-line denominations, a new yearlong study has found. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a shift in the balance of leadership," said USC religion 
professor Donald E. Miller, one of four co-authors of the $115,362 study. "Many 
of the most vigorous, creative new programs are coming out of evangelical and 
Pentecostal quarters." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional Protestant churches, Jewish agencies and large African American 
congregations remain active in addressing community needs -- and still command 
the most visibility, the study said. But the trend is toward a growing role for 
evangelicals and Pentecostalists of all ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think probably the future rests with those leaders," UC Santa Barbara 
religion professor and study co-author Wade Clark Roof said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Marked by a populist, grass-roots and neighborhood-based approach to pressing 
urban problems, the heightened activism in Los Angeles reflects a national 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
 In cities such as Miami, Boston, New York and Chicago, there is a new interest 
and urgency in ministering to the homeless, the poor, the hungry and the 
jobless on a scale that heretofore characterized efforts of old-line or 
traditional religious bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The new civic activism among evangelicals and Pentecostalists is attributed 
not only to religious convictions, but to a new confidence that has come with 
maturity as their memberships and influence have increased throughout the 
United States. Since 1960, for example, the number of denominations affiliated 
with the National Assn. of Evangelicals has nearly doubled, to 44 denominations 
representing almost 5 million members. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, many of their members are located in the cities' most trouble-plagued 
districts, requiring local congregations to either adapt their ministries to 
the times or risk the decline that many old-line denominations, such as 
Presbyterians and Episcopalians, have faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve years ago, the Church of the Nazarene, an evangelical denomination 
founded 99 years ago in Los Angeles, operated six nonprofit "compassion 
centers" in the United States to meet inner-city needs. Today there are more 
than 75. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is that evangelical groups are on the front lines," said Michael 
Mata, former executive director of the Bresee Institute, one of numerous 
evangelical-based para-church organizations involved in neighborhood 
development and job training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Inner-city recipients of these ministries, such as Kalani Benavides, say that 
without such neighborhood efforts their lives would be miserable. 
</P>
<P>
 Benavides, 43 years old and homeless, said she lost her job as a hotel manager 
last December. She sleeps on a lawn across the street from the First Church of 
the Nazarene in the Mid-Wilshire district. "We have a lot of people out here 
who can't survive on their own," she said in an interview. "They need to lean 
on someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Like 300 others every week, Benavides leans on the church's food program, 
which serves the homeless, the elderly and families with little or no income. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, not all evangelicals and Pentecostalists have taken up the urban 
challenge. Many -- perhaps most -- continue to be suspicious of a "social 
Gospel," according to the Rev. Ron Benefiel, senior pastor at the Nazarene 
congregation, the mother church of the denomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Both evangelical and Pentecostal Christians continue to place great emphasis 
on the Gospels' message of salvation and a personal relationship with Jesus 
Christ. Compared to old-line Christians, they are generally more intent on 
seeking converts. In addition, Pentecostalists place special importance on the 
"gifts of the Holy Spirit," such as speaking in tongues -- ecstatic utterances 
that are seen by believers as evidence that one has been baptized by the Holy 
Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the study reports a proliferation of inner-city programs. They 
include Zoe Christian Fellowship's entrepreneurial training school in Compton, 
the independent Faith Outreach Church's anti-gang program in East Los Angeles 
and the Van Nuys Church on the Way's food distribution program. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent and Pentecostal churches formed the Southern California Coalition 
of Religious Leaders, which has organized a credit union to help minorities 
start small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Para-church organizations active in inner-city work include World Vision, 
World Impact and the Bresee Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-line denominations pioneered and remain active in many of these same 
ministries. Their most recent and visible program is the Hope in Youth 
anti-gang program, backed by nine Jewish and Christian denominations and 
spearheaded by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Los 
Angeles. It has a projected five-year, $91-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But one distinction continues to separate evangelicals and Pentecostalists 
from traditional Protestants, Roman Catholics and Jews. Although all have 
successfully applied for government grants to operate nonprofit outreach 
programs, lobbying government for structural changes to root out the causes of 
racism and poverty remains the purview of the traditional denominations. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one confidant of Mayor Richard Riordan, who asked to remain anonymous: 
"From the perspective I have from the mayor's office, I don't see them 
(evangelicals and Pentecostalists) at all." 
</P>
<P>
 But few old-line religious leaders disputed the study's contention of greater 
activism by evangelicals and Pentecostalists at the neighborhood level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are, fortunately, heavily involved," said the Rev. J. Delton 
Pickering, executive director of the United Methodist Church's Council on 
Ministries in the church's California-Pacific Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, traditional leaders took issue with what may be the study's most 
controversial finding, one that John B. Orr, professor of religion at USC and 
chief author of the study, said may require further research. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on interviews and anecdotal information, the study contends that 
although there has been a surge in activity by evangelicals and 
Pentecostalists, a 1960s liberal coalition of Establishment Protestant 
denominations, Jewish congregations and civil rights groups appears to be 
eroding. 
</P>
<P>
 It also said that only the Roman Catholic Archdiocese and, to a lesser extent, 
Jewish agencies, have been able to maintain the central staffs needed to 
support the large-scale political leadership that characterized the old liberal 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't agree with them," said the Rt. Rev. Chester Talton, suffragan 
(assistant) bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. "We are heavily 
involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Talton, and regional officials of the United Methodist Church and the 
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, said they have experienced no cutbacks 
in staff for inner-city programs. Only the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. reported 
a cutback in its hunger and homeless program. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey J. Fields, rabbi of Wilshire Boulevard Temple, a Reform congregation, 
and chairman of the Interfaith Coalition to Heal L.A., said old-line 
denominations remain the dominant players in the city's political-religious 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 But he, like the study's authors, said something is changing. "It is my sense 
that what we've got growing at the heart of L.A. right now is a new birth of 
interfaith cooperation. It is nascent. It needs a lot of culturing. But what is 
clearly different from the past is a realization that the mainline, traditional 
religious organizational structure, particularly Christian-Jewish or 
Protestant-Catholic-Jewish, is simply no longer a fit for Los Angeles."

PROMISE KEEPERS MEN'S GROUP HOLDS MEETING IN ANAHEIM

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of men from throughout California and other states will conclude a 
two-day conference at Anaheim Stadium today sponsored by Promise Keepers, a 
burgeoning Christian men's renewal movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1990 by University of Colorado head football coach Bill McCartney, 
Promise Keepers drew 50,000 men last year to a similar conference in Boulder, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the group has attracted men from a wide range of Christian 
backgrounds, evangelical and Pentecostal Christians make up the core of the 
ministry's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Promise Keepers, we're men who are rallying and we're saying to the nation 
that a man's man is a godly man," McCartney said in an interview. "A real man 
is a man of God, a man of substance, who counts his words and stands behind 
them. He's a man who is sensitive to those around him. He sees the need in 
others and responds to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The movement has not been without controversy. In 1985, the American Civil 
Liberties Union threatened to sue the University of Colorado because it said 
McCartney was using his position as coach to voice private religious views. But 
no suit was filed.

 This month brings observances of important religious holidays to the 
Southland's Jewish communities, which will celebrate the festival of Shavout, 
and Islamic communities, which will mark the holy day of Eid Al Adha. 
</P>
<P>
 SHAVUOT Sundown Sunday marks the beginning of Shavuot, the Feast of Weeks, 
which carries that name because it comes seven weeks after Passover. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rabbi Shimon Paskow of Temple Etz Chaim in Thousand Oaks, the 
holiday was originally an agricultural event, known as the Feast of the First 
Fruits, and later became known as the time when God gave the Torah, the first 
five books of the Bible, to the people of Israel at Mt. Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hearing the voice of God speak at Mt. Sinai is the great religious experience 
of the Jewish people -- when they are given the great moral laws, including the 
Ten Commandments, the legal basis for all society." 
</P>
<P>
 To commemorate that event, many traditional Jews will stay up at synagogues 
all night Sunday studying the Scriptures. At services, the Ten Commandments 
will be read, as will the Book of Ruth, which recalls the ancient harvest 
festival and Ruth's adoption of the Jewish faith. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also customary on Shavuot to refrain from eating meat and substitute a 
menu of dairy dishes, such as cheesecake and blintzes "to respect all life, 
including animal life, and have a greater appreciation of the earth's produce," 
Paskow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most U.S. synagogues hold confirmation services during Shavuot to reaffirm the 
loyalty of teen-agers to religious teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 Orthodox and Conservative synagogues will hold services Sunday evening, Monday 
and Tuesday. Tuesday's services will include memorial prayers for the dead. 
Reform and Reconstructionist Jews observe the holiday Sunday and Monday, 
incorporating memorial prayers on those days. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about traditional and creative Shavuot services and 
activities, phone the Board of Rabbis of Southern California at (213) 852-1234 
or one of the synagogues below: 
</P>
<P>
 * Temple Beth Am, Conservative (310) 652-7353 
</P>
<P>
 * Sha'arei Am: Santa Monica Synagogue, Reform (310) 453-4276 
</P>
<P>
 * Temple Beth Hillel, Reform (818) 763-9148 
</P>
<P>
 * Chabad of Hancock Park, Orthodox (213) 954-8381 
</P>
<P>
 * University Synagogue, Reconstructionist (714) 553-3535 Temple Israel, Reform 
(213) 876-8330 
</P>
<P>
 EID AL-ADHA Eid Al-Adha will be observed Saturday with chanting, prayers and 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15,000 people will pray at the Los Angeles Convention Center, said Ahmed 
El-Gabalawy, chairman of the religious and social committee of the Islamic 
Center of Southern California. The doors will open at 5:30 a.m. for the 6 a.m. 
service of takbeer (chanting) and prayer; a second service will be held at 7:30 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Saturday, an Eid carnival will be held from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at 
Calamigos Ranch in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday, which commemorates the patriarch Abraham's near-sacrifice of his 
son Isaac, falls on the 10th day of the month of Zulhijah of the lunar Islamic 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Making a Hajj, or pilgrimage, to Mecca for this occasion is the fifth pillar 
of Islam -- after the declaration of faith, prayer, alms-giving and fasting 
during the month of Ramadan. Each year, about 2 million pilgrims undertake the 
journey, according to Gabalawy, who left Tuesday for the Saudi Arabian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hassan Hathout, the center's outreach director, said: "Requiring those who 
can physically and financially afford to make the pilgrimage to do so once in a 
lifetime aims at connecting Muslims with the patriarch Abraham." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilgrims would sacrifice a lamb and give part of it to the poor, according 
to tradition. Nowadays, Hathout said, people who don't have the facilities to 
slaughter a sheep donate money to societies and associations, mostly in other 
countries, which perform this rite and give the meat to the hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday is also important, he pointed out, because "it reminds us of the 
common root of Jews, Christians and Muslims, all sharing Abraham as the 
patriarch and the great-grandfather of Moses, Jesus and Mohammed." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's service is free. Tickets for the carnival are $20, with children 
under 5 free. Tickets must be purchased in advance from the Islamic Center of 
Southern California, 434 S. Vermont Ave., Los Angeles (213) 382-9200. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday from 5 to 7 p.m., Muslims, Christians and Jews will explore 
differences and similarities in their views of prophet Abraham at an 
inter-religious event at the Islamic Center of Southern California. Speakers 
include Rabbi Alfred Wolfe of the Skirball Institute on American Values, Msgr. 
Royale Vadakin of St. Anastasia Church in Westchester, and Dr. Hassan Hathout 
of the Islamic Center. Admission is free. (213) 382-9300, Ext. 16.

WORK-SAFETY CITATIONS ISSUED IN FATAL FIRE; INQUIRY: CAL/OSHA HOLDS THE O.C. 
SANITATION DISTRICT AND PASCAL AND LUDWIG ENGINEERS RESPONSIBLE FOR EIGHT CODE 
VIOLATIONS RELATED TO TWO WORKERS' DEATHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Sanitation District and an Ontario engineering firm were 
cited Friday by state authorities for eight safety code violations related to a 
flash fire earlier this year that fatally injured two workers at the district's 
Huntington Beach facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The citations carry civil penalties totaling $11,150 against the firm of 
Pascal and Ludwig Engineers for four of the violations. The sanitation district 
is precluded from fines because of its status as a government agency, state 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The citations mark the end of a two-month investigation of the Feb. 2 incident 
by the state Division of Occupational Safety and Health. However, Cal/OSHA 
district manager Jim Brown said a separate criminal investigation will 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the criminal inquiry was being handled by the Cal/OSHA Bureau of 
Investigation, which reviews all fatal incidents in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Ludwig, Pascal and Ludwig's chief executive officer, was not available 
for comment Friday. Earlier in the week, however, he indicated that the company 
"would not be surprised" should citations be issued against the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 A sanitation district spokeswoman said district officials would not respond to 
the Cal/OSHA findings until sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA was not able to pinpoint the exact cause of the fire. In the 
citations, officials said the victims were working in a potentially hazardous 
area near the source of a combustible oxygen mixture used in the sewage 
treatment process. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the victims were working in a seven-foot-deep sewage channel 
using a pneumatic tool similar to a jackhammer. It could not be determined if 
the combustible mixture was ignited by a spark from the hammer, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire claimed the lives of Robin Miller, 37, and Joe Patterson, 32, both of 
Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
 In their review, Cal/OSHA officials said the company had failed to properly 
secure a stepladder to the channel, the workers' only means of entry and exit 
from the channel; did not provide operating and rescue procedures prior to the 
employees' entry to the area; failed to require testing for dangerous air 
contamination, and did not block an ignition source from entering the channel 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitation district was cited for its failure to post adequate warning 
signs for the dangers in the area; for failing to inform the engineering firm 
of special permitting procedures required for working in such a confined space; 
for failing to inform the contract workers of all the work hazards, including 
the presence of the combustible oxygen mixture, and for failing to inform 
Pascal and Ludwig that special precautions were required for working in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown declined to characterize the nature of the infractions, saying only: 
"I'll let the citations speak for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The citations do not pose any operational restrictions for the company or the 
sanitation district. However, the findings are expected to raise additional 
questions among the district's board of directors about Pascal and Ludwig's 
qualifications for a $1-million construction contract for future work on 
district projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The district staff had recommended a month after the fire that the contract be 
awarded to Pascal and Ludwig, but board approval was delayed until formal 
investigations of the incident were completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, several directors expressed reservations about approving Pascal and 
Ludwig should the firm be sanctioned by Cal/OSHA. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, several directors said they had not yet reviewed the Cal/OSHA findings 
and declined any comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one likes to have this kind of tragedy," said a sanitation district 
official who declined to be identified. "No one in the sanitation district 
does. No one at Pascal and Ludwig does. In this society, it seems, we have to 
find fault with everything that goes wrong. There is no such thing as bad luck 
anymore."

SYRIAN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH VISITS CAPISTRANO MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing in the courtyard of Mission San Juan Capistrano Friday evening, 
21-year-old Michael Touma could hardly contain his excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the day I've been waiting for all of my life," said Touma, who soon 
would have a chance to walk alongside His Holiness Patriarch Mor Ignatius Zakka 
I, supreme head of the Syrian Orthodox Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The patriarch, spiritual leader of the Syrian branch of the Orthodox church, 
was a long way from his home in Damascus Friday. As part of the final leg of a 
monthlong Southland tour of various parishes of his own faith and others, he 
toured Mission San Juan Capistrano and heard about its 200-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 In the church leader's country, many of the monasteries are well over 1,000 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very much aware that, when we speak of 200 years, that in your country 
is yesterday," said mission tour guide and history expert Bob Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
 The church leader wore a black gown and cap and carried a black staff. The 
61-year-old patriarch in his Orthodox denomination is similarly ranked to the 
Pope among Roman Catholics. There are 3 million members of the Syrian Orthodox 
church worldwide with 28 churches in the United States and Canada and roughly 
150 Syrian Orthodox families in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our spiritual father," said Linda Malki of Anaheim, who serves as 
treasurer of St. Mary's Syrian Orthodox Church of Orange County in Santa Ana. 
The church arranged the mission tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The patriarch's visit was his first to a California mission and was the first 
known visit to Catholic-founded Mission San Juan Capistrano by an Orthodox 
patriarch, said Msgr. Paul Martin, the mission pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This an historical experience for both of us," Martin said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Syrian Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church split 15 centuries ago 
because of theological disagreements over the nature of Christ. Of late, 
though, the patriarch and Pope John Paul II have been on friendly terms. In 
1984, the two men signed an historic agreement allowing their members to take 
Holy Communion in either church. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the patriarch's initial travel plans this month called for him to fly 
next week from Southern California to Lebanon to meet with the Pope and 
patriarchs of other Orthodox denominations. The Pope has since had to cancel. 
</P>
<P>
 Touring the mission Friday, the church leader said, "When I enter any Roman 
Catholic Church, I feel it is my church. It is useful for the East and West to 
meet together." 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq-born, the patriarch speaks perfect English, as well as Aramaic, the 
language used in the Syrian Orthodox Church.  
</P>
<P>
 As the mission tour guide ushered him into Serra Chapel, the patriarch knelt 
at the altar and then recited the Lord's Prayer -- in Aramaic. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who knows it only in English and Latin, remained silent. 
</P>
<P>
 But afterward, he said, "It's the prayer that unites us all. It was a sign of 
unity."

A SAFE PLAY BY THE PRESIDENT; COURT NOMINEE SEEMS TO HAVE KEY POLITICAL 
ADVANTAGE: EASE OF CONFIRMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton has played it safe with his Supreme Court nomination of 
federal appeals judge Stephen G. Breyer -- a person who, like most of the 
current justices, carried the credentials of an astute veteran jurist before 
being selected. 
</P>
<P>
 In due course, the nation will learn much more about Breyer: his upbringing, 
his values, his judicial philosophy. By all reports, it appears he will have 
little difficulty being confirmed, despite previous questions about delinquent 
Social Security taxes for hiselderly part-time housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 His days as chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee seem to have 
served him well. Republicans as conservative as Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah 
praise Breyer; Democrats as liberal as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts 
salute him. He is described alternately as moderate to conservative and 
moderate to liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 If he is indeed a man in the middle, perhaps he can help find a consensus on a 
court that runs from just left of center to the extreme right. He will serve 
his country well if he can help bring about agreement. However, it must be 
asked whether Clinton, on this, his second opportunity to shape the court, 
chose the best man or woman. Or did he pick Breyer because he didn't wish to 
spend political capital fighting for a nominee who might also have been 
impressive but a less safe choice? 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court is the protector of the Constitution, the reflection of the 
moral values of this nation. Perhaps history will conclude that Breyer belongs 
in the pantheon of great justices. In any event, we hope that in exercising 
what Clinton has called one of the most important acts of his Administration, 
the President did not overvalue the ease-of-confirmation factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton may get a chance to appoint still another Supreme Court justice after 
Breyer. Judge Breyer, if confirmed, may turn out to be an excellent justice. 
But excellence comes in many forms. Surely there is room on the court for 
broader diversity in legal experience, race, gender, geography, academic and 
economic background -- without sacrificing brilliance.

SAVING FACE, AND LITTLE ELSE; BIG POWERS' ACCORD ON BOSNIA MAY PROVE EMPTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the foreign ministers of 
France, Britain, Germany and Russia -- a so-called "contact group" formed at 
the request of Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin -- met Friday in Geneva and 
made yet another effort to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. And while their 
joint agreement is unprecedented in some respects, there still may be less to 
it than meets the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 France, with thousands of troops committed to UNPROFOR, the U.N. force in the 
former Yugoslavia, had been threatening to withdraw them, a move that could 
have forced a complete U.N. withdrawal. The threat was a transparent attempt to 
force U.S. support for the Bosnia partition terms that France and Britain both 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
 SENATE SQUEAKER: Meanwhile, earlier in the week the U.S. Senate, by a narrow 
50-49 vote, passed a bill that would require the President unilaterally to 
break the U.N. arms embargo against the Bosnian state. Passage of the bill gave 
extra force to a second bill, passed by an identical tally, calling on the 
President to seek NATO and U.N. action ending the same embargo. While neither 
bill was seen as likely to become law because of a presidential veto, the votes 
gave the U.S. delegation added clout in dealing with the Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 So to reach Friday's agreement, both sides gave in to some degree. The United 
States, which had officially backed the claim of the Muslim-Croat federation to 
58% of Bosnia-Herzegovina, agreed to support a plan that would give only 51%. 
It was the first time all the great powers had agreed to a partition formula. 
In exchange, the Europeans agreed to support a U.S. proposal to lift economic 
sanctions against Serbia only after a peace agreement is actually being 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 But while that compromise may help save face for diplomats meeting at Geneva, 
there are no indications that it will sway the combatants in the former 
Yugoslavia. For some very big questions remain to be answered when and if they 
meet at their own peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 A 'NEW' SERBIA: When and if a Serb victory in Bosnia is ratified in the 
interests of peace, is the earlier Serb seizure of Croatian territory also 
ratified? If so, the Croats will fight on; if not, the Serbs will do so. A 
"whole" Serbia containing both the Krajina region of Croatia and the 70% of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina conquered during the last two years would be a Serbia with 
no resemblance to the historical Kingdom of Serbia or to the Serbian component 
of the pre-World War II "Triple Kingdom" of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. But 
there is every reason to believe that nothing less than this will appease the 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 And since denying Serbia this larger victory would require just the kind of 
commitment of blood and money that the Western allies have been unwilling to 
make to defend the existing Bosnian state, the proposed peace settlement would 
in all likelihood amount to very little. In the end, it may prove to be no more 
than a face-saving gesture for the great powers who, in the Balkan crisis, all 
seem to have been rendered virtually powerless.

DRIVING TOWARD ZERO EMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Driving solo, you zip down the diamond lane to a free, preferred parking slot 
at work; your car is fueled for free while you're at your desk, and you get a 
big discount on annual car registration. For a long weekend trip, you use one 
of the gasoline-car rental coupons that came with your short-range vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 These are among the ideas being considered or implemented by government and 
private companies to encourage purchases of electric cars. The incentives will 
add up, supporters say, overcoming initial consumer resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the California Air Resources Board had listened only to auto 
makers at its hearings Thursday and Friday in Los Angeles, it would have 
concluded that its 1998 deadline for requiring 2% of each company's sales to be 
zero-emission vehicles was hopeless. Battery technology lags, the auto makers 
said. No one will buy them. The deadline will hurt business. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, the board's own staff, battery manufacturers and environmental groups 
had another message: The deadline can be met and the technology is in the 
pipeline. The board showed no indication to bow to auto maker proposals to 
delay the deadline, appoint an outside review board or review the zero-emission 
mandate every six months. Board members wisely understood that each of the 
proposals would kill investment by introducing uncertainty and betray other 
states that are following our lead. All the while, German, Italian and Japanese 
companies would be readying their own electrics for market. 
</P>
<P>
 As Malcolm Currie, former chairman of Hughes Aircraft and co-chairman of the 
Project California high-tech coalition, told the hearings: "Tough goals with 
incentives in the end do drive technological innovation. An electric vehicle 
revolution is clearly being born." We just have to make sure its birth 
certificate says "California."

ASSAULT WEAPONS AND CONSTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The argument that the assault weapons being banned (May 6) have only one 
purpose, which is to take human life, is as irrelevant as it is true. Our 
forefathers gave us the right to keep and bear arms so that we could rise up 
against a tyrannical government. No one has presented this in the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Banning assault weapons will be as futile as banning cocaine has proved to be. 
But it is a very big step down the slippery slope of socialism. If the press 
does not present this side of the argument, it is an accessory to the process.

<P>
 The right to "keep and bear arms" is as important today as any time in our 
nation's history. Self-defense is the primary law of nature and should not be 
taken away. Law-abiding responsible citizens are being stripped of their 
self-defense under the guise of crime control and now are outgunned by the 
criminals. This step in gun control should serve as a loud and resounding 
wake-up call to anyone interested in personal freedoms and constitutional 
rights. We all say we want safer streets, but we must insist that our elected 
officials do it without destroying the Constitution.

 * In reply to the commentary by Michelle Scully ("A Gun Widow's Request: 
Courage in Congress," May 5) on the banning of assault weapons: I agree that 
something should be done to get rid of assault weapons, but I don't know if the 
legislation passed by Congress will be enough to stop what is already in our 
streets. The legislation will make it harder to obtain assault weapons by 
stopping the sale of them in gun stores, but people will find other ways to 
obtain them. It will be like drugs -- they are illegal, but they are still sold 
in our streets. If assault weapons are sold illegally, they will most likely 
get into the wrong hands, like gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation is important and will help, but is a very small piece to 
solving the big problem of how to get the guns off the street that are already 
out there. The world is getting to the point where you can't step out of your 
own house without being mugged or carjacked. In addition to passing the 
legislation, we need to have tougher penalties for people who ignore the law.

 * In reviewing the extended debate surrounding the House bill to ban assault

right to "keep and bear arms." It appears that many of those who use this 
argument have overlooked the fact that when this idea was added to the Bill of 
Rights, arms consisted of single-shot, muzzle-loaded pistols and muskets. I 
wonder if pro-gun interests would be willing to keep and bear those kinds of 
arms and agree to support a ban on all other types of weapons.

UC REGENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George S. Mitrovich ("California's 'Secret' Elite Has Got to Go," Commentary, 
April 19) substituted frustration for facts. Thirteen of the 15 sitting 
appointed regents are Republicans, two are Democrats; at least five of the 
seven ex-officio regents are Democrats, including the student regent, both 
alumni regents, the lieutenant governor of California and the Speaker of the 
Assembly. While most regents would agree that 12 years is too long a term, 
during what Mitrovich calls the "zenith" period of the University of 
California, appointed regents served 16-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of UC's budget reductions over the last four years has been 
nonpartisan. When Clark Kerr was UC president, state money provided 60% of UC's 
total budget -- but less than 25% today. State support now is what it was in 
1986, nearly a billion dollars below what normal enrollment growth and 
inflation should have generated. Regardless of their ethnic, socioeconomic or 
political backgrounds, all of the regents in the last four years have faced the 
same dilemma: preserving quality, access and affordability with vastly 
diminished resources. Given few options, that has meant cutting jobs and 
salaries, consolidating programs, raising fees, seeking more private money and 
linkages with industry. The decisions made have been sad and painful; they have 
not been politically partisan. 
</P>
<P>
 Compelled to ask more of fewer at-will employees who are expected to help 
preserve the nation's best public university, the regents have reluctantly 
granted salary increases to a limited number of UC executives to keep them. But 
there have also been nine reforms in UC's executive compensation since 1992, 
aimed at lowering the compensation packages paid (already below what comparable 
institutions offer) and assuring as open a compensation process as possible. If 
UC fired every executive, that would save less than one-quarter of 1%of its 
total annual budget.  
</P>
<P>
 The real story is that the UC is fighting to fulfill its mission despite 
massive budget cuts and layoffs. More students from families earning less than 
$30,000 a year are entering today than three years ago. Students are graduating 
in just over four years, on average. Faculty are teaching more. UC still brings 
more than $1 billion to California each year in federal funds alone.

LONG-TERM HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On behalf of the members of the California Assn. of Health Facilities (CAHF), 
which represents more than 1,200 licensed long-term care facilities providing 
long-term care for patients statewide, I must clear up some inaccuracies in a 
recent article ("Muzzled in a Nursing Home, the Spirit Is Extinguished," 
Commentary, May 6). 
</P>
<P>
 While we are concerned about the quality of life for the disabled and 
acknowledge the importance of funding for home-care services, we maintain that 
"robbing Peter to pay Paul" is not the answer and would simply deny funding to 
those elderly and disabled people who live in nursing facilities and need the 
care provided there. 
</P>
<P>
 Facility-based long-term care and home care are not alternatives to each 
other. Rather they serve distinctly different patient populations and degrees 
of disability. Facilities provide 24-hour nursing care and provide short-term 
rehabilitation for people of all ages. Home health care plays an important role 
for individuals with supportive families who no longer need facility-based care 
and require nursing care on an intermittent basis. 
</P>
<P>
 While living in a nursing facility does not provide as much autonomy as living 
at home, facilities do accommodate residents. For example, dietary staff work 
with residents and their families to provide meals that satisfy the resident's 
nutritional needs as well as personal likes. Facilities offer a wide range of 
rehabilitative and restorative care, social services and activity programs, all 
with the goal of helping residents achieve their maximum potential physically, 
mentally and socially. 
</P>
<P>
 Nursing facilities must strike a delicate balance between the provision of 
adequate supervision and much needed privacy. Common areas in nursing 
facilities tend to be open, while resident rooms are considered private.  
</P>
<P>
 Nursing facility residents maintain all those rights guaranteed to them by the 
U.S. Constitution, including the right to vote. In addition, the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA) mandates specific rights guaranteed to all 
residents of nursing facilities. These include the right to voice concern about 
a facility, the right to receive visitors, the right to form resident councils, 
and the right to informed consent, privacy and the freedom of choice.

<P>
 * The commentary by Mike Ervin was excellent. If we, as a nation, are ever 
going to contain health-care costs we must reduce our emphasis on institutional 
care. This is particularly important in the field of long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
 We spend about $60 billion annually on long-term care, but only 18% of this is 
used for home-based care. This is an obvious underutilization of an important 
health-care resource. Most individuals in nursing and convalescent homes are 
not sick. They are there because they have difficulty with routine activities 
of daily living. These include bathing, dressing, and preparing meals. Keeping 
these individuals in an institution costs from four to 30 times the cost of 
home care. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of our association are pioneers in the field of home care. Many of 
us are severely disabled, yet we remain active in the community. We know that 
home-based long-term care can be both safe, and cost-effective.

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Controller Michael White announced this week that he is leaving to take a 
similar job with the Orange County Sanitation District. 
</P>
<P>
 White, 39, a San Clemente resident who has worked for the city for more than 
five years, accepts a new controller position recently created at the Fountain 
Valley-based district. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Clemente, White headed an accounting department of about 20 people and 
a city with a $56-million annual budget. At the sanitation district, White will 
work in a finance department that is overseeing a $635-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a step up for me, but I'm looking forward to the challenge," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 His salary range will also increase from a maximum of $6,105 a month in San 
Clemente to $7,730 a month at the sanitation district. 
</P>
<P>
 White's last day with the city will be May 27. No decision has yet been made 
whether to promote a San Clemente staff member or to recruit a controller from 
the outside, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, senior accountant Brad Cagle will take over as controller. LEN

SIMI CHURCH MAY HOUSE ARTS CENTER; CULTURE: COUNCIL WILL VOTE ON A CONTRACT 
NEXT WEEK. THE VACANT STRUCTURE WOULD BE TURNED INTO A 300-SEAT THEATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The transformation of a vacant Simi Valley church into a multiuse cultural 
arts center could start in less than two weeks if the City Council votes Monday 
to award the $2.55-million construction contract to a Van Nuys building firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Tri-Con Contractors Inc. of Van Nuys turned in the lowest of six bids, 
promising to revamp the inside of the Old Methodist Church for $2.65 million by 
February, 1995. The church is at 3050 Los Angeles Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 But city planners shaved $100,000 off the price after recalculating the cost 
and securing a promise from local sound-system manufacturer Cerwin-Vega to 
donate $54,000 worth of speakers and amplifiers to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 If the City Council approves Tri-Con's bid, plans call for workers to 
transform the main church into a 300-seat theater, complete with a stage that 
includes room for backdrops and lights. The basement would be made over into a 
meeting room that could double as a smaller theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers also will repair vandalized stained-glass windows with glass taken 
from other windows at the church, then build enclosed light fixtures behind the 
restored panes so the windows will shine to the outside world and keep street 
noise from getting inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the 1920s-vintage building -- which has served as church, synagogue 
and mortuary -- will begin May 23, pending council approval, city planners 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the building is being envisioned by some members of the commission 
appointed to oversee it as a foothold for the growth of Simi Valley's 
long-frustrated arts community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this as the beginning of some exciting times culturally," said Dudley 
Wynkoop, an architect whom the City Council named Monday as one of five members 
of the Cultural Arts Center Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynkoop said he believes the city eventually will need a larger theater and 
perhaps even a fine-arts museum as Simi Valley's arts community grows and 
residents begin to support it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Simi Valley) needs a real theater in order to accommodate popular 
performances like Broadway plays," he said. "Something in the order of 1,300 
seats -- not to compete with Thousand Oaks' (Civic Arts Plaza) but to 
complement it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Altmar, another commission member, said even by itself the new Cultural 
Arts Plaza will give room for actors, singers, dancers, painters, photographers 
and other artists to show their work and enrich the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking forward to bringing in some really good culture and . . . 
events to tie our community together," said Altmar, a mortgage company systems 
analyst and part-time actor who moved here from Santa Barbara last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simi Valley is one of the safest places to live," he said. "And yet there 
isn't that binding together that normally happens in a community through a 
cultural center." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Mikels, a longtime supporter of the project, agreed that if 
the commission can help make the center self-sustaining, it could lead to 
construction of other arts centers in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, I have said that once we had the sticks-and-bricks project, that 
the rest would materialize," Mikels said Friday. The city has already lost the 
Santa Susanna Repertory Company to the Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks, where 
the troupe will open a performance of "Man of LaMancha" in the small theater, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is room at Simi Valley's Civic Center site next to City Hall for a 
theater of about 1,000 seats, but residents will have to decide whether they 
want to see it built at an estimated cost of $17 million, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If in fact the arts community and support for the arts community grows 
consistently, they will outgrow that 300 seats" at the Cultural Arts Center, 
Mikels said. "If in fact the mood of the community is in 10 or 15 years that 
they wish to build a facility like that, it could very well happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, money from the Community Development Agency has already been 
set aside to repair and transform the Old Methodist Church, Mikels said, and 
the commission is expected to work with the arts community to raise money to 
operate the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynkoop, Altmar and the other members of the commission -- Peggy Sadler, 
Sharon Stewart and Jay Bloom -- are expected to meet next week to begin 
plotting the center's future.

2 MEN SENTENCED IN COCAINE-FUSING CASE; COURTS: COLOMBIAN NATIONALS EACH GET 
NEARLY 16 YEARS IN FEDERAL PRISON FOR ROLES IN SHIPPING DRUG-LACED DOG KENNELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Colombian nationals were each sentenced to nearly 16 years in federal 
prison Friday for their roles in conspiring to ship cocaine-laced dog kennels 
into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 A defense attorney for one of the accused had argued that FBI agents had 
entrapped the two men and encouraged them to commit the crimes.But days into 
their trial in late March, Henry Bustos and Harold Satizabal abruptly pleaded 
guilty to the conspiracy counts in exchange for an agreement by prosecutors to 
drop two additional counts against them. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Gary L. Taylor said there was no evidence of misconduct on 
the part of either the FBI or a federal informant used to make a case against 
the two men. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal sentencing guidelines, Bustos and Satizabal faced up to 17 1/2 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors said Bustos fused the cocaine into the fiberglass used to 
make the kennels and Satizabal was an engineer, both working for the Cali 
Cartel in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of their arrests in Garden Grove nearly two years ago, federal 
authorities called a news conference to show the lengths to which some drug 
smugglers will go to ship cocaine.

2 DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE; OXNARD: BODIES OF THOMAS AND LINDA SHIPLEY 
ARE FOUND IN THEIR HOME. SOME SAY THEY SEEMED VERY MUCH IN LOVE. OTHERS CITE 
THE HUSBAND'S TEMPER. 
</P>

<P>
 A 43-year-old Oxnard man apparently shot his 40-year-old wife and then killed 
himself Friday at the couple's home on South F Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were identified as Thomas and Linda Shipley by Ventura County 
coroner's officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A motive had not yet been determined late Friday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still talking to family, friends and neighbors," said Oxnard police 
spokesman David Keith. "But it appears to be a murder-suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies were discovered just before 1 p.m. Friday by Thomas Shipley's 
mother, who told police she had become concerned when she hadn't heard from the 
couple and went to check on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's officials said the cause of death for both was gunshots to the upper 
body, but they had not determined late Friday how many shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 According to neighbors, the couple had lived in the modest but well-kept home 
for about eight years. Linda Shipley's son, a student at Buena High School, 
lived with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said Thomas Shipley was a plumber and worked at the Port Hueneme 
Navy base. Until recently, Linda Shipley worked at a dentist's office, but left 
that job to take landscaping classes at a local community college. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said she spent hours in her garden, carefully putting in rock 
borders and planting flowers and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just planted those tomato plants," said Edna Miranda, pointing toward 
several young plants in the Shipleys' yard that are just beginning to creep up 
a homemade latticework of wood and twine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shipleys were often seen together in the mornings drinking coffee and 
smoking cigarettes on the tiny front porch of the house, neighbors said. They 
described the couple as pleasant and -- at least from outward appearances -- 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to bring her roses all the time," said Sandra Benavides, whose 
grandmother lives across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked so much in love," agreed her mother, Martha Benavides. "They were 
nice people. They were always together." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Martha Benavides said, the couple had tried to start a 
Neighborhood Watch. "They cared about the community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other nearby residents, all of whom declined to give their names, said 
Thomas Shipley had a bad temper and was known to yell at neighbors, 
overreacting to the noise of a lawn mower or neighborhood children. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda said the last time she saw the couple alive was Thursday afternoon, 
when both were out in their yard. Thomas Shipley was pacing up and down his 
driveway, Miranda said, and he seemed agitated. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked like he was waiting for something or somebody," she said. 
Eventually, his mother arrived and all three went inside, she said.

MAN ALLEGES NEWPORT BEACH ILLEGALLY BLOCKING TOPLESS BAR 
</P>

<P>
 The owner of a restaurant who wants to offer nude and topless entertainment 
sued the city of Newport Beach Friday, charging that the city has illegally 
prevented the opening of his business. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the city filed a lawsuit against An Nguyen, owner of Paddy Murphy's 
topless bar in Santa Ana, who wants to open a similar bar called the Mermaid in 
Newport Beach near John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own lawsuit, Nguyen said the "Newport Beach City Council disagrees with 
the adult theme of the entertainment to be offered at the Mermaid," and is 
violating his First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen said in the suit that the remodeled club, in the 4200 block of 
Martingale Way, "will continue to offer food and drink under its use permit but 
intends to change the characteristics of the entertainment offered from a live 
band to non-obscene nude and semi-nude entertainers." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials could not be reached for comment Friday, but council meetings 
drew passionate pleas from residents living near the Mermaid to keep the nude 
and topless entertainment out of the neighborhood.

COUNCIL MAY GIVE SMOKERS A BREAK; THOUSAND OAKS: CITY LEADERS WILL TAKE UP A 
DECISION TO BAN SMOKING AT SIDEWALK CAFES. BUT MANY SAY IT GOES TOO FAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Working at a North Ranch newsstand, Greg Scapa has come to dread the browsers 
he refers to as "old-lady customers with heavy perfume." 
</P>
<P>
 When they linger around the magazine rack, he often feels sick. But he never 
asks them to take their scents elsewhere. Flowery fumes might offend his 
sinuses or upset his stomach, but Scapa figures his customers have rights. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as a self-described "social smoker," he says he has rights, too. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Scapa caught a whiff of the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission's recent 
decision to ban smoking from outdoor restaurant seating areas, he was furious. 
City Council members will take up the issue Tuesday, and Scapa is ready to give 
them an earful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, c'mon, the air you breathe out here is worse than the smoke," Scapa 
said in frustration. As he talked, cars idled in a parking lot just a few feet 
from outdoor tables at a frozen yogurt shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if (the ban) is supposed to be good for you, it still suppresses your 
rights," he said as a friend nodded in agreement and blew smoke in his face. 
"That's just ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 For once, tobacco fans like Scapa seem to have the sympathy of the Thousand 
Oaks council majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Local smokers lost a round last fall, when the council agreed to ban 
cigarettes from all restaurants and public buildings. By a 4-1 vote, council 
members also imposed a smoke-free zone around public doorways. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to lighting up in sidewalk cafes, a majority of council 
members seems inclined to cut smokers some slack. Among other Ventura County 
cities with smoking laws, only Ojai has a ban that extends to outdoor dining. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to apply a standard of reasonableness," Councilman Frank Schillo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Councilman Alex Fiore put it: "You've got to give someone some kind of 
a break sometime." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore, who smoked for nearly half a century before quitting five years ago, 
cast the sole vote against Thousand Oaks' original smoking ordinance. At the 
time, he argued that an anti-smoking law could hurt local businesses, 
especially sports bars. Now, however, he said six months of experience has 
shown him that cash registers keep on ringing even in the face of a smoking 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
 But he remains reluctant to extend the law to patio cafes. 
</P>
<P>
 Joined by Schillo and Councilwoman Judy Lazar, Fiore is suggesting a 
compromise: allowing restaurant owners to set aside several outdoor tables for 
smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a solution would please Shirlee Bourland, a 55-year smoker who chose to 
sit outside a restaurant even on a chilly, overcast afternoon, simply so she 
could light up while sipping her iced tea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government is taking over too much," she said. "They won't be happy until 
they ban smoking in my own house." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, anti-smoking activists argue that cigarette fumes can be 
just as deadly outdoors as inside. Most sidewalk eating areas are relatively 
cramped, so smoke drifts easily from one table to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel that smokers have the right to invade my space," said one 
Thousand Oaks resident sitting outside a sandwich shop. "I come out to enjoy a 
meal, and I should be able to enjoy it without having to breathe smoke that has 
circulated through someone else's organs." 
</P>
<P>
 City councils in Camarillo, Moorpark, Ojai and Ventura have all passed laws 
banning smoking in most restaurants and public places. But only Ojai's law 
specifically addresses outdoor seating. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai officials have received several complaints from restaurant owners since 
the law took effect, and the council may eventually reconsider, said Dan 
Singer, an assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one provision puts our law in the elite class of very restrictive 
ordinances," Singer said. Especially as summer approaches, he added, some 
restaurant owners have lobbied for outdoor smoking sections.

ELECTIONS / VENTURA COUNTY SUPERVISOR; POLITICAL NEWCOMER REVIVES DORMANT PLAN 
FOR WORLD-CLASS MARINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although he has never run for public office before, rancher Carter Ward says 
he is running for Ventura County supervisor because he has ideas for keeping a 
lid on property taxes while generating more revenue for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution, Ward says, would be for the county to consider a long-dormant 
proposal to build a world-class marina along a 2 1/2-mile stretch of beach 
property near the Los Angeles County line. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was initially proposed by landowner Lee Mansdorf a decade ago, but 
never seriously pursued with county leaders. It would include a separate 
development on 1,100 acres Mansdorf owns nearby with several luxury estates, 
two hotels, a golf course, a 60-acre lake and other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward estimates the county could generate as much as $5 million annually in tax 
revenues from a 3,500-slip marina project, money that could be used to pay for 
law enforcement, fire protection, waste disposal and other county services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's going to hurt the environment, so I think it's OK," said 
Ward, 50, who is competing for the 2nd Supervisorial District seat that covers 
Thousand Oaks, Oak Park and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward said he would rather see development of a marina instead of having state 
and federal park agencies continue to buy up thousands of acres in the Santa 
Monica Mountains. Those agencies do not contribute to the county tax rolls, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to raise money," said Ward, who received a $500 campaign contribution 
from Mansdorf. "I don't want to have to pay more taxes. It seems like a good 
deal. The guy owns the land, and I'm a property rights advocate from the word 
go. I say, why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ward said he did not enter the supervisorial race at the urging of Mansdorf, 
but rather because he believes the marina plan fits in with other ideas he has 
for generating additional revenues for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed Deer Creek Marina -- so named because it would be situated along 
the southern tip of the county near Deer Creek Road -- first surfaced in the 
mid-1980s when Mansdorf began to put together preliminary plans for the 
project. But the proposal was never brought before the Board of Supervisors for 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansdorf said part of the reason is he did not believe the support was there 
to approve zoning changes for the project. He hopes the proposal will receive 
positive attention through Ward's campaign for supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carter likes the project because he realizes that this is a positive use of 
land and that it will provide revenues for the county and jobs," he said. 
"There's no reason it should be turned down." 
</P>
<P>
 Mansdorf said if the county approves the zoning changes necessary for the 
project to go forward, he could easily recruit a developer to build the marina 
and nearby resort. The marina, he said, would be the only one of its kind 
between Channel Islands Harbor in Oxnard and Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansdorf said an agreement would be worked out under which the county would 
own the marina, with Mansdorf holding a long-term lease. With the county as 
owner, he said, it would be easier to get approval for the marina from the 
California Coastal Commission and other regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's interest out there from developers," Mansdorf said. "We have all the 
engineering and geological reports ready. We just need the permits." 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to raise revenue for the county would be to ease zoning 
regulations in unincorporated areas to allow estates to be built on 10-acre 
parcels, Ward said. Zoning now restricts housing construction on lots of 10 to 
100 acres in size, with hilltop land being more restricted. But Ward said 
anything beyond 10 acres makes it too expensive to build. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a Mediterranean climate where everybody wants to live," he said. 
"I say let them come in. But we don't have to have high density like Los 
Angeles. I think what we can do is have affluent houses (on 10-acre lots) that 
pay lots of taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Ward, a retired civil engineer, said he would push to do away with 
what he considers overly restrictive building codes. One example of this, he 
said, is a county policy that requires households dependent on well water to 
have the capability of providing up to 7,200 gallons of water per day. Ward 
said the average daily use of water per person is about 50 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people who want to build houses but are not permitted because of 
regulations -- regulations that don't make any sense," Ward said. "And I'm 
tired of it, so I'm becoming political." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward's ideas for generating revenues have raised questions from some of his 
opponents, including Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo, former Ventura 
County Supervisor Madge Schaefer, taxpayer advocate H. Jere Robings and 
attorney Trudi Loh. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said the county already owns two of nine marinas operating out of 
Channel Islands Harbor. He said what makes these marinas different from what 
Ward is proposing is that they are situated within a protected inlet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deer Creek Marina "would have to be built right out on the ocean, and I 
have a problem with that," Schillo said. "I wouldn't be for it just for the 
money. I would come at it from the standpoint of aesthetics and from an 
environmental standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Another question that has arisen is whether there is enough demand to support 
another large marina in the county. Channel Islands Harbor, which has 2,600 
boat slips, has a 15% to 20% vacancy rate due in large part to the recession, 
Harbor Master Frank Anderson said. The 1,500-slip Ventura Harbor reported a 
similar vacancy rate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ward said the Deer Creek Marina would be different because it would only 
allow large yachts and sailboats, rather than small motorboats. He added that 
even if the marina were approved it would probably not be built for three or 
four years, by which time the economy should be better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be a win-win situation," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Loh expressed reservations about Ward's proposal for 10-acre 
residential lots in unincorporated areas. She said she thought there might be 
better ways for generating more revenues for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather see the county spend less money, instead of plowing down our 
countryside," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ward said if people want to preserve private land as open space, then they 
should "buy it because I don't want to buy it with my tax dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 On other issues, Ward said he believes the county Fire Department in the 
future should share in revenues generated from the Proposition 172 sales tax 
measure approved by state voters last fall to fund public safety programs. The 
money is now split among the county's law enforcement agencies and criminal 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the firefighters say they need it, I'm going to have to go along with 
that," Ward said, adding that firefighters helped save his hilltop ranch when 
wildfires swept through Little Sycamore Canyon near Malibu in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through the fire of 1993 with great admiration for the Fire 
Department," Ward said. "I saw the most efficient group of men and women work 
for me than I've ever seen before." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a county audit showed that the Fire Department was spending too much 
on overtime and sick leave, Ward said he would have to examine the report 
before commenting on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward said he does not support the creation of a county firefighter paramedic 
program because it is not clear how it would be financed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not want to start a program unless I knew how we were going to pay 
for it," he said. "Show me how we're going to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward said he supports a proposal to establish a commercial airport at Point 
Mugu if it can be done without disturbing residents who live in the surrounding 
area. The Navy has offered to share its runway with the county to cut its 
operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great idea," Ward said. "But the (potential noise) is a 
question that we would have to look into." 
</P>
<P>
 On waste management, Ward said he reluctantly backs the development of a new 
west county landfill at Weldon Canyon near Ojai. Officials and residents there 
have successfully fought against a dump for years. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bailard Landfill in Oxnard scheduled to close in 1997, Ward said, the 
county has little choice but to develop another landfill to service west county 
cities. He said he understands Ojai residents' opposition to a landfill at 
Weldon Canyon but knows of no other possible site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Show me a better place," Ward said. "I'm on their side. But they need to help 
me. I haven't seen a better solution." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ward said the county must start looking for alternatives for disposing of 
its trash in the future, such as advanced recycling and composting programs. He 
said during the 20 years he worked at Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory in 
Port Hueneme he did extensive research on landfills and recycling programs and 
understands the challenges facing the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Landfills are dangerous," he said. "We are now entombing our trash. We 
surround it with plastic, and this is a pathogenic spawning ground for future 
diseases." 
</P>
<P>
 To further reduce trash flow into landfills, Ward suggested that the county 
might consider implementing a reward or penalty to households to increase the 
effectiveness of its recycling programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Loh has suggested that the county possibly ship its trash by rail to 
another county or state, Ward said he believes that would be far too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 If a landfill is developed at Weldon Canyon, he said, it should be one with a 
short life span to further pressure the county into finding other alternatives 
for trash disposal. "Landfills are not the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On health care, Ward said he does not support a proposed $30-million expansion 
of the Ventura County Medical Center. He said the county should hold off on its 
plans for the project until it is known what impact the Clinton 
Administration's health-care reforms might have on the local health-care 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The county project has spurred an opposing campaign by neighboring Community 
Memorial Hospital in Ventura that considers the public hospital a potential 
competitor for private patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is we have too many vacancies in hospitals, and I would 
never be in favor of a program that would be a loser economically," he said. "I 
don't want to build empty bed spaces." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ward said his main focus will be to generate revenues for the county by 
working to ease zoning and building regulations. He plans to hold a candidates' 
debate at his Dry Gulch Ranch on May 22. 
</P>
<P>
 With no name recognition or government experience and little money to spend on 
his campaign, Ward said he knows he is fighting an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I lose, I won't be disappointed," he said. "At least I can say I tried."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A BUMPY START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the continuing flap over the section of a public road that is due to be 
folded into the San Joaquin Hills toll road, the tollway agency has said all 
along the explanation is simple: Nothing has changed; the inclusion of the 
public road was always planned. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a rocky road.First the complaints, kept in a high profile recently 
by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), received a boost in credibility 
from a finding by the state legislative counsel. The counsel this week found 
that Orange County and San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency 
officials apparently broke state law when they incorporated part of Newport 
Coast Drive into the tollway without first conducting hearings and filing an 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 The opinion had no binding effect, and then the state attorney general's 
office weighed in with an opinion completely to the contrary. But don't blame 
the public if it is confused. As a gesture of good faith, the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors really should have highlighted the planned toll before 
turning over part of the road. The fact is, that even if a promised free detour 
is built, the public that looked to the opening of Newport Coast Drive as a 
handy, direct route from coastal points in the southern part of the county to 
the Corona del Mar and San Diego freeways will be inconvenienced without having 
had much say. That's not a very good way to begin the relationship between a 
new toll road and its potential customers.

FAST-FOOD EATERY ROBBERY SUSPECT ARRESTED; 2 AT LARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A man police believe is a former Taco Bell employee has been arrested on 
suspicion of committing a string of early-morning robberies at fast-food 
restaurants in Tustin and Irvine, including two Taco Bell restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Bravo Jimenez, 28, was arrested at an apartment building in the 1100 
block of Santa Ana Boulevard in Santa Ana at about 3:15 p.m. Thursday, Irvine 
Police Investigator Pete Linton said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are still looking for two accomplices.  
</P>
<P>
 In the robbery on April 30, three men walked into the Taco Bell restaurant at 
17th and Yorba streets in Tustin at 6 a.m. They forced the manager at gunpoint 
to empty the safe of $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The second robbery was at 6 a.m. at the Taco Bell restaurant at 2222 Barranca 
Parkway in Irvine on May 7, Linton said. Three men forced the manager at 
gunpoint to open the cash registers, from which they stole $583, Linton said. 
One robber then fired his weapon once into the ground and threatened to return 
to kill the manager. 
</P>
<P>
 A restaurant employee told police he recognized one of the robbers as a former 
Taco Bell employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also allege Jimenez was part of a third robbery at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday at 
the Carl's Jr. restaurant at 4770 Irvine Blvd. in Irvine. Three men held up the 
manager and employees and took $1,165 from the cash registers, Linton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linton said Jimenez was also wanted on a $25,000 warrant in connection with a 
strong-arm robbery in 1993 in Santa Ana. LYNN FRANEY

BULLS SURVIVE MUTINY; NBA PLAYOFFS: ANGRY PIPPEN SITS DURING KUKOC'S WINNING 
SHOT AS 104-102 VICTORY TRIMS KNICKS' LEAD TO 2-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You want to see a fourth quarter? The Chicago Bulls will show you a fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of being upstaged by the New York Knicks in the last period, the Bulls 
put on an exhibition that will be talked about for years, becoming the second 
team to blow a 20-point fourth-quarter lead in postseason, winning, 104-102, on 
Toni Kukoc's 20-footer at the buzzer . . . . and then revealing top player 
Scottie Pippen had mutinied in the final huddle. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen was not on the floor when the Bulls, having just given up the last of 
their lead, in-bounded the ball with :01.8 left, an unusual time to rest one's 
leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scottie Pippen was not involved in the final play," Coach Phil Jackson said 
stonily after reducing the Knicks' lead in the best-of-seven series to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked out of the play. I left him off the floor. That's as much as I'll 
talk about that and we have a practice tomorrow at 11." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, Jackson left. 
</P>
<P>
 There were reports Pippen exploded when Jackson designed the play for Kukoc, 
cursed at Jackson and took himself out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phil and I kind of exchanged some words," Pippen said. "That was pretty much 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't Phil taking me out of the game. We pretty much exchanged words and 
I took a seat. I think it was frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for that, it was a routine finish. 
</P>
<P>
 After blowing a 15-point lead at the end of Game 1 and an eight-point lead at 
the end of Game 2, the Bulls spent Friday night outdoing themselves, cruising 
into a 22-point lead late in the third quarter and giving that up. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 89-70 after three quarters, 90-70 after Kukoc made a free throw with 
11:37 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, however, the Bulls forgot to score. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks had outscored them, 28-15, in the fourth quarter of Game 1, 27-19 
in the fourth quarter of Game 2, and went to work on them once more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls didn't make a shot until 36-year-old Bill Cartwright bounced in a 
jump hook with 6:39 left. By that time, the Knicks had closed to 90-83. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1:09 left, the Bulls were still clinging to a 102-96 lead when the Knicks 
mounted a last surge. Patrick Ewing, who would score 14 points in the quarter, 
made a layup and it was 102-98. 
</P>
<P>
 With 29 seconds left, he made another layup and it was 102-100. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls ran down the clock and gave the ball to Pippen, shooting three for 
14 to that point in the three fourth quarters of the series, including one for 
four in this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen couldn't even get off a shot this time. Hounded by Anthony Mason, he 
started his move late, had to take a desperate three-pointer and hit nothing 
for a 24-second violation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks got the ball with :05.5 left, called time and set up a play. Ewing 
wheeled into the lane and hit a seven-foot hook over Cartwright with :01.8 left 
to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
 All that remained for the Knicks was to get their hands up while Chicago 
missed the last shot, then carry their momentum into overtime and polish off 
the Bulls for a 3-0 chokehold lead in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bulls' huddle, strange things were happening that might have been 
covered up, were it not for the candor of the principals. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cartwright later when questioned about it: "Why are you asking me Scottie 
questions?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said B.J. Armstrong: "All I know is the play was called for Toni and I ran the 
play the way it was called. It was a good win for us. I just want to focus on 
the positive and go on to Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kukoc: "I think Scottie was hurt or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Pippen's feelings were hurt when Jackson set the play up for Kukoc, 
but Scottie was ice cold and Toni had won three regular-season games with 
last-second shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Myers inbounded the ball to Kukoc, fighting off Mason at the top of the 
circle. Mason was later criticized for letting Kukoc catch the ball, but he 
actually jostled him enough to flirt with a foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Kukoc caught the ball, turned, fired and scored.  
</P>
<P>
 "Easy," Kukoc said, asked how he does it. "Shoot the ball and hope it's going 
to go in." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Riley: "Even when you know what they're going to run, we've seen Kukoc do 
that two, three times. It was a great pass, a great catch and a great shot. He 
got a great look and it was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "That shot is a dagger in the heart, but you've got to weather it. This is the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks lead the series but have to figure out how to start the game the 
same time as the Bulls. Also, they might be without their starting point guard, 
Derek Harper, who engaged Chicago's Jo Jo English in a wild second-quarter 
wrestling match, slinging English into the courtside seats, virtually in the 
lap of Commissioner David Stern sitting five rows back. Both benches emptied.  
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the Bulls have to figure out how to play the fourth quarter, 
not to mention when not to quit.

GROSS, NEAT AS PIN, STICKS PADRES, 5-4; DODGERS: HE STRIKES OUT EIGHT IN SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE VICTORY. DREIFORT EARNS FIFTH SAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Kevin Gross, usually a master of the messy performance, was neat and 
near-complete Friday night, cruising through the last-place San Diego Padres, 
5-4, before a sellout Dodger Stadium crowd of 54,374. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the defense behind him was a little shaky, including errors by right 
fielder Raul Mondesi and second baseman Delino DeShields, Gross (2-1) wiggled 
out of trouble and lasted long enough to take advantage of the Dodgers' 
sixth-inning scoring binge. 
</P>
<P>
 After his complete-game victory over the Giants in his last start and a series 
of quality outings from Dodger starters, Gross (2-1) pitched eight innings 
Friday, giving up eight hits, all three runs, walking one and striking out 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer Darren Dreifort, who got his fifth save, gave up an unearned run in the 
ninth, but got pinch-hitter Billy Bean to ground into a double play to seal the 
Dodgers' victory, their fourth in a row on this home stand. They remain one 
game behind the front-running San Francisco Giants in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
 Double plays and misplays had put the Dodgers behind, 3-1, before they scored 
four runs in the sixth to take a two-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I've got to pitch good, but it's a good feeling to know the guys are 
always battling back, that they're going to score runs," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were down, those guys were coming back, they were encouraging me. You 
can see it, it's just the atmosphere in here now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tried to pitch as good as I could as long as I could, and give the 
guys a chance to battle back. That's what's going to make this a winning season 
for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we just have to keep it going." 
</P>
<P>
 With one out, DeShields drew a walk, Mike Piazza hit his seventh home run of 
the season, a blast well over the 395-foot sign in right-center field, to even 
the score against starter Wally Whitehurst. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fastball," Piazza said. "He had been throwing me a lot of breaking 
balls, but I just waited and I got a pitch I could drive." 
</P>
<P>
 After a walk to Tim Wallach, Henry Rodriguez's double off of center fielder 
Derek Bell's glove in deep center moved Wallach to third. Padre Manager Jim 
Riggleman removed Whitehurst (2-4), who had lasted at least six innings in each 
of his previous four starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Donald Elliott immediately gave up a double to Eric Karros, which 
scored Wallach and moved Rodriguez, who had held up on the flare down the 
right-field line, to third. One out later, Rodriguez scored on a wild pitch to 
give the Dodgers a 5-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Through four innings, the Dodgers, slowed by two double plays, had six hits 
but only one run, a Mondesi home run in the third that matched Phil Plantier's 
earlier solo shot for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres looked like they might blow open the game in the top of the fourth. 
Tony Gwynn hit a leadoff home run to right field to put the Padres ahead, 2-1, 
and Plantier followed with a double off of the center field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gross settled down, striking out Bell and Scott Livingstone, then getting 
a comebacker from Brad Ausmus to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really started to establish the breaking ball in the later innings," 
Piazza said of Gross. "He pitched a great game tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth, the Padres scored on a Gwynn fly ball down the left field line 
that Rodriguez played into a double after turning the wrong way, and a two-out 
run-scoring single under Jose Offerman's glove by Bell, to make the score 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 By the eighth, Gross looked to be cruising toward his second consecutive 
complete game. But Dreifort was sent out to start the ninth, and Gross said 
that was fine with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know if I'd make it out of the eighth," Gross said when asked 
if he wanted to pitch the ninth. "But hey, we won."

SALMON'S EXPLOITS CRUSH MARINERS; BASEBALL: RIGHT FIELDER GOES FIVE FOR FIVE 
WITH FIVE RBIS IN 11-1 VICTORY, IS 13 FOR 15 IN LAST THREE GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Angel right fielder Tim Salmon trotted across home plate Friday night, looked 
at teammate Bo Jackson and started giggling, lowering his head as he made his 
way into the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon's exploits in the Angels' 11-1 victory over the Seattle Mariners were 
such that Jackson stood in front of him, dramatically shrugged his shoulders 
and threw his hands into the air as if to say, "I can't believe what I'm 
seeing." 
</P>
<P>
 Culminating the finest three-game hitting performance in the American League 
in the last 42 years, Salmon went five for five, including two home runs and a 
double, drove in five runs and scored four. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon's 13 hits in three games tied an American League record, last 
accomplished by Walt Dropo of the Detroit Tigers July 14-15, 1952. The only 
other American League player to accomplish the feat was Joe Cronin of the 
Washington Senators June 19-21, 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three games, Salmon batted .867 (13 for 15) with two doubles, one 
triple, three home runs and eight runs batted in.  
</P>
<P>
 What kind of week has it been for him? 
</P>
<P>
 He batted .632 (24 for 38) in the last seven games with three homers, three 
doubles, one triple, 14 runs driven in and 12 runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, who never had more than three hits in a game during his career, has 
now produced a five-hit game and two four-hit games in consecutive games. He 
has raised his batting average from .225 to .336 in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Salmon has had momentary streaks of invincibility, feeling as if no 
pitcher can get him out, but never has he experienced anything like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth," Salmon said, "I can't believe it myself. I'm just 
zeroed in right now. The ball looks so big." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who produced a season-high 22 hits, including four by Chili Davis, 
matching a career high. They have 44 hits in their last two games in the 
Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, they provided starter Chuck Finley all the support he would need. 
Finley (2-3) yielded only one hit through the first eight innings, but Rich 
Amaral ended his bid for a second one-hitter with a leadoff homer in the ninth. 
He settled for a three-hitter, and took part in the Salmon celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (16-20), who have won three consecutive games to remain in first 
place in the American League West, also managed to keep alive the continuing 
saga of "Where's J.T. Snow?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although first baseman Eduardo Perez was unable to play for the eighth 
consecutive game, and will test his ailing wrist in batting practice today, 
Snow remains in triple-A Vancouver, wondering what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow's uniform remains neatly folded and tucked away in the visiting clubhouse 
at the Kingdome. But Snow, who is hitting .301 with a team-leading eight 
doubles, five home runs and 24 RBIs, remains in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is pushing J.T. so hard," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said, "but if 
I brought him up, where am I going to play him? People forget there's a guy 
doing better in the major leagues than one guy is doing in the minor leagues, 
and that's (Jim) Edmonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since Perez has been out, Jimmy's been a godsend. If we hadn't been able to 
play Jimmy at first base, we would have had to rush J.T. up here. I'm not 
saying we wouldn't bring up J.T., but I wouldn't arbitrarily put J.T. in and 
Edmonds out. That would be crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to do what's best for the California Angels, and we want to do what's 
best for J.T. Snow. If the two come together, great. If they don't, you're 
going to have to prioritize, and the Angels come first." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds, who is batting .346, understands the fans' fascination with Snow. 
He's a local boy, the son of a former Ram all-pro receiver, looks like an 
All-America hero and carried the Angels the first month of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good friend of mine," Edmonds said, "and I don't think anybody wants 
to see J.T. do bad. It's hard to lose a friend like that (to the minors). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to fight to stay here, and hope things work out for both people."

IT'S NO DUTCH TREAT TO BE ON THIS TEAM; SOCCER: AS USUAL, THE NETHERLANDS' 
WORLD CUP ENTRY HAS FALLEN PREY TO PETTY JEALOUSIES, RIVALRIES AND EGO 
PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If any of the elite World Cup teams can be called a collective head case, it 
is the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 With some of the world's most highly skilled players and a tradition of 
outstanding coaching, the Dutch should rank with Brazil and Germany among the 
perennial favorites for soccer's greatest title. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no matter how intimidating their roster looks, the Dutch always seem to 
fall prey to petty jealousies, rivalries and ego problems that erode team 
discipline and cause them to self-destruct. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the Netherland's World Cup players staged a mutiny against 
Coach Rinus Michels, who took them to court in a vain attempt to preserve his 
control over the team. The team played with lackluster spirit in the 1990 Cup, 
showing little dismay when they failed to win a game. The Dutch record was one 
loss and three ties, including one against a clearly outmatched Egyptian team. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the players wanted the legendary Johan Cruyff to return from 
Barcelona -- where he has turned the Catalonian team into a European powerhouse 
-- to take over as coach from Dick Advocaat. Just when the deal seemed 
clinched, Cruyff backed out because of a dispute over a footwear and clothing 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Advocaat will be launching his quest for a World Cup title in the 
United States with a group of disgruntled players who have openly flouted his 
authority and expressed disdain for his tactics and strategy. It does not augur 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Dutchmen's hard-nosed approach and their devastating attack 
game always makes them a threat when they can set aside their internal 
bickering and concentrate on the match at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The Netherlands managed to squeak through one of the toughest qualifying 
rounds, which included England, Norway, Poland and Turkey. And they did so in 
the absence of two of their greatest players, midfielder Ruud Gullit and 
striker Marco van Basten, the only man in history to be named European player 
of the year three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Basten, a magnificent forward who has been compared favorably to his 
mentor Cruyff, was one of the biggest disappointments in the 1990 World Cup in 
Italy, where he failed to score a goal in any of of the Netherlands' four 
matches. This year, he will not be able to play because of persistent troubles 
with his ankles and a slower-than-expected recuperation from surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 With van Basten out of the picture, the scoring pressure will fall on Dennis 
Bergkamp. Less temperamental and more steady than van Basten, Bergkamp has been 
known as a diligent practitioner who has worked with Herculean dedication on 
his speed, footwork and ball-handling ability ever since he was discovered as a 
prodigy at the age of 12 by Cruyff. 
</P>
<P>
 Since signing his first professional contract with Cruyff's former team, Ajax 
Amsterdam, Bergkamp, now 25, has developed into one of the best young forwards 
in international soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 While less volatile than some of the other Dutch stars, Bergkamp is also known 
to have his quirky side that could leave him vulnerable to hothouse, 
pressure-packed situations such as the World Cup. He refused foreign offers 
early in his career because he said he could not face the prospect of living 
alone in a foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he has gone on to a successful career as a soccer mercenary with 
Internazionale in Milan, he is still judged by analysts to be rather shaky when 
playing on foreign turf, away from the consoling inspirations of a hometown 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 But the key to Dutch success in the World Cup this year will rest, as always, 
with its charismatic midfielder, Ruud Gullit. With his dreadlocks flailing and 
his precision passes riddling opposing defenses, Gullit can be a breathtaking 
"free role" player to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Bergkamp can be expected to provide some of the most spectacular 
two-man plays in the Cup games -- provided their heads and their bodies are up 
to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullit did not go through the qualifying round and is not scheduled to join 
the Dutch team until the middle of May. He contended that professional 
commitments in Italy kept him away from the national squad. But everyone in 
Holland seems aware that another principal reason for his absence lay in his 
personal quarrel with the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullit was one of the first players to insist he would only play if Cruyff 
became head coach for the World Cup. Even though Gullit renounced his earlier 
vow and decided to play under Advocaat, it is still unclear whether they have 
truly patched up their dispute and to what extent their personal friction will 
undermine team unity. 
</P>
<P>
 Another question mark remains Gullit's physical condition. He has recently 
incurred a serious back problem, compounding his history of knee injuries. 
Since 1989, he has had four operations on his left knee and one on his right 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 At the ripe old age of 32, it is difficult to know whether his legs can endure 
the grueling Cup schedule -- in the summer heat of Florida and the rest of the 
East Coast -- regardless of his renowned grit and determination.

RECOVERING KRONE IS READY TO RIDE; HORSE RACING: JOCKEY WILL RESUME RACE RIDING 
NEXT WEEK, MONTHS AFTER CAREER-THREATENING SPILL. 
</P>

 Doctors said it was the kind of leg injury suffered by race-car drivers, or 
someone who's fallen from great height. 
</P>
<P>
 Her ankle was rubble. Her sternum was hammered by a thousand pounds of 
flailing terror. Her left arm was cut, exposing bone. Her buttock revealed the 
source of the calamity. On it was a hoofprint. 
</P>
<P>
 For one of the nation's best-known female athletes, two rounds of leg surgery 
required special implants: child-size plates, child-size screws. 
</P>
<P>
 In a child-size voice, 4-foot 10 1/2-inch jockey Julie Krone says her lower 
right leg is becoming less of a bother now, nearly eight months since it was 
rearranged in a dreadful spill at Saratoga. A titanium plate and six screws 
were affixed to her fibula, the outer leg bone between the knee and ankle. 
Eight days later, another plate and eight screws helped restore the shinbone 
near the instep. Her limp, doctors told her, may never leave. 
</P>
<P>
 She thinks she came within an inch and a half of death -- the width of the 
fiberglass safety vest she'd been wearing that Aug. 30 afternoon, when a 
horse's hoof crashed upon her chest amid the body-flinging chaos. Her heart was 
bruised, her desire untouched. She began galloping horses last month at Belmont 
Park, and plans to ride for real beginning next week. 
</P>
<P>
 A hundred pounds of unchecked spunk and horseback fury, Krone, 30, has won 
2,766 races worth $53.9 million, making her by far the most successful female 
jockey ever. Three times she has placed among the top six in jockey victories 
for a year, four times among the top 12 in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 She became the first woman to displace them atop the jockeys standings at 
major-league parks, winning season titles at Monmouth Park, at the Meadowlands 
(where she later set a track record with 132 wins in a season) and at Belmont 
in New York, self-professed hub of the racing universe. 
</P>
<P>
 And if she couldn't outride the guys, she could outslug them. At Bowie, she 
was fined for shoving jockey Yves Turcotte after he whipped her horse during a 
race; at Monmouth Park, she hit jockey Miguel Rujano with a crisp right and 
reportedly slammed Joe Bravo's head into a rail as part of a postrace 
altercation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Krone began new assaults. In early June she took Colonial Affair 
into the Belmont Stakes and left it as the first woman to ride the winner of a 
Triple Crown race. In mid-August, she joined Angel Cordero Jr. and Ron Turcotte 
as the only jockeys in 126 years to win five races on a card at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
 Krone was immersed in her most gratifying season when all hell broke loose on 
the final day at Saratoga. A horse ridden by inexperienced apprentice Filiberto 
Leon veered in front of Krone's mount, Seattle Way, in a congested stretch run 
on the turf. Krone instinctively pulled back hard, but found no options. 
Seattle Way tripped over the rear legs of Leon's mount and went down, starting 
a chain reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me there was a genuine fear," Krone said. "But even being in the hospital, 
selective amnesia kicks in. I don't remember so much of the fall, and we have 
no memory of pain . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 She began her rehabilitation by walking the sands of Anguilla, in the British 
West Indies, and now spends two hours a day reconditioning her leg. The brace 
will stay on even after she resumes riding, until the Breeders' Cup this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as Triple Crown competition begins to occupy the racing public, Krone is 
trying to stay detached. She is consumed by the challenge to get well soon, 
consciously dismissing the likelihood that arthritis will someday seize her 
reconstructed joints for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an athlete and, having a natural very positive attitude, I just feel happy 
with my own progress," she said. "What I do is, I get pumped up about losing my 
crutches, and I get pumped up about being off my pain medication, and I get 
pumped up about being able to do my first double-footed leaps in (physical 
therapy). And I'm still in a lot of pain, so every night that I sleep without 
having to wake up and take something, those are the things I get pumped up 
about. I don't have any choice. I'm not going to sit back and pout about 
something I can't control. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, I do have fleeting moments on the other side where I just 
go, 'Wow, this is probably going to hurt me when I'm old,' and, 'My Triple 
Crown horse could be warming up right now,' a little bit like that. But my 
basic instinct is just to have positive energy, go forward, work out hard. I 
feel more crazed and obsessed in being successful now than I ever have in my 
life. I feel more focused, more patient, more driven."

ANGELOS CAN'T RESIST GANT; BASEBALL: ORIOLES HAVE THEIR BEST RECORD IN 24 
YEARS, BUT OWNER STILL WANTS FORMER BRAVE OUTFIELDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ever wonder what Christmas is like in the Angelos household? 
</P>
<P>
 "So you've got three cars," Peter Piper might say. "Here's a fourth!" 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 They've got three starting outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Oriole Owner Peter Angelos is proposing a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Gant is coming off a broken right leg. He probably would cost $3 million 
for half a season. And he likely would force the benching of Mike Devereaux -- 
the Orioles' $3.375-million center fielder -- against right-handed pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos wants him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles are 21-10 for the first time since 1970, and Angelos wants him. 
Jeffrey Hammonds likely will be sidelined for only seven to 10 days, and 
Angelos wants him. Camden Yards will be packed regardless, and Angelos wants 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 What an owner. 
</P>
<P>
 What a country. 
</P>
<P>
 When it appeared Hammonds' knee injury might be serious, Angelos suggested 
that club officials trade for Andy Van Slyke. Such a move won't be necessary. 
Signing Gant isn't necessary, either. But he's out there, isn't he? And all 
he'd cost is money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where the bottom of the well is, if there is a bottom," one club 
official said Thursday, almost gleefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwarzenegger flexes his muscles, Streisand flexes her vocal chords, Angelos 
flexes his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, Ram owner Georgia Frontiere probably didn't know what hit her Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting? What meeting? 
</P>
<P>
 "Gimme your team," Angelos bellowed, waving his bankbook. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams would be the topper -- but the signing of Gant would ensure that the 
baseball people don't get too jealous. Gant averaged 29 homers, 97 runs batted 
in and 31 stolen bases for Atlanta the past four seasons. How would Manager 
Johnny Oates use him? Any way he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles aren't worried about overcrowding. Just this week, they lost 
Hammonds and Chris Sabo for 15 days, and nearly lost Devereaux and Harold 
Baines. Injuries will happen, but Oates wouldn't be starting Jack Voigt nine 
times in 10 games if he had Gant. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the addition of Gant would carry an added bonus -- it probably would 
force Oates to rest Devereaux and Brady Anderson. Can't wait to see Anderson in 
September. He has started all 31 games, even though he's batting .219, even 
though he's in a three-for-31 slump. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gant, Oates could bench Anderson against left-handers in favor of an 
all-right-handed-hitting outfield, or plug in another outfielder and make Gant 
his right-handed designated hitter. Devereaux would be the odd man out against 
right-handers, but the Orioles don't care. They probably won't re-sign him, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemistry? It's a legitimate question. Gant, 29, is not a clubhouse problem, 
but his presence alone would be disruptive. The bigger question, however, is 
whether the Orioles can even sign him. Two of their division rivals -- Toronto 
and Boston -- should be far more desperate to sign Gant. 
</P>
<P>
 Gant would replace Blue Jay left fielder Carlos Delgado, or Red Sox right 
fielder Billy Hatcher. If he's smart, he'll sign for the rest of the season, 
put up big numbers, then re-enter the free-agent market. If the Orioles are 
smart, they'll try to sign him long-term, rather than lose him to Toronto or 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is not unlike when the Orioles attempted to trade for Rickey 
Henderson last August -- Hammonds was injured, and the Blue Jays were involved. 
As it turned out, Toronto made a bad trade, parting with Steve Karsay. But who 
knows? Henderson might have helped the Orioles win the division. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how these things work -- one club's gain is another's loss. Anderson is 
signed through 1996. Hammonds is five years away from free agency. If the 
Orioles locked up Gant, they could strongly consider trading one of their young 
outfielders -- perhaps even Alex Ochoa. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? It will take a blockbuster to land San Diego's Andy Benes, and it now 
appears the Orioles waited too long to trade Arthur Rhodes, Brad Pennington and 
even Manny Alexander. They're loaded with young outfielders -- Mark Smith, Jim 
Wawruck, Curtis Goodwin. Gant, then Benes. One move, then another. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith looms as an inexpensive replacement for Devereaux, but money evidently 
is no object. The Orioles aren't just after Gant and Benes. They're talking 
about pursuing the Angels' Dwight Smith or St. Louis' Gerald Perry as a 
left-handed hitter off the bench. And they wouldn't mind adding a veteran 
starter to pitch middle-inning relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine if they were 10-21 instead of 21-10. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that frightening, actually. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos would just buy the Atlanta Braves.

SPECIAL HAS LOST ITS LUSTER; HORSE RACING: PIMLICO'S SHOWCASE RACE FOR OLDER 
HORSES DRAWS A FIELD OF ONLY SIX -- AND THEY ARE MEDIOCRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Racing fans who study the field for today's Pimlico Special will ponder two 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the universal racetrack puzzler: Who is going to win? That's a tough 
one, but As Indicated might have a slim edge over Devil His Due. 
</P>
<P>
 The other question is even more complex: Why didn't this Grade I event, with 
its $600,000 purse, attract a better field? Only six horses were entered 
Thursday, and two of them are noncontenders. Devil His Due, the favorite, has 
won one race in his last eight starts. Valley Crossing is winless since July. 
As Indicated is in sharp form, but he has never won a Grade I stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pimlico Special, which had an illustrious history decades ago, was revived 
in 1988 and conceived as a showcase for the nation's best older horses -- the 
ones who become stars in the Triple Crown series and then are often forgotten 
by the media and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The race was an immediate success. In its first running, Bet Twice defeated 
Alysheba in a rematch of their memorable battles in the 3-year-old classics. In 
1991, Farma Way set a track record to beat the previous year's Preakness 
winner, Summer Squall. In 1992, Strike The Gold pulled a dramatic upset by 
recapturing the form that had carried him to a Kentucky Derby victory. 
</P>
<P>
 So where are the big-name stars this year? Lenny Hale, Pimlico's director of 
racing, can tick off a a number of horses who might have run but for injuries 
or other setbacks, but the Special's weak field is in fact a reflection of some 
deep, industry-wide problems rather than an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Special has been hurt, in part, by the demise of the American Championship 
Racing Series, which had given some continuity and structure to stakes 
competition for older runners. 
</P>
<P>
 Top horses would crisscross the country, from the Gulfstream Park Handicap to 
the Oaklawn Handicap to the Pimlico Special because the one with the best 
overall record in the ACRS earned a big financial bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ACRS died at the end of last season because there were so many 
disagreements among the participating tracks. Santa Anita dealt a severe blow 
to the series by pulling out because it didn't want California's star horses to 
leave home and compete in other parts of the country, such as Maryland. "I'd 
love to see an ACRS back again," Hale said, "but getting people in racing to 
agree is a hard thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest problem faced by the Pimlico Special -- as well as other stakes 
for older horses -- lies with the animals themselves. The quality of racehorses 
has suffered a serious decline in recent years, probably because foreign buyers 
dominated the U.S. yearling sales in the 1980s and took the best-bred stock to 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 This weakness has been obvious in the Triple Crown races of the 1990s; last 
year's classic winners were a dismal group. There are no bright stars for the 
Pimlico Special to attract. 
</P>
<P>
 And if racehorses of the 1990s aren't as talented, they aren't as durable, 
either. This observation is not based on any romanticization of the past; an 
abundance of statistics support it. In 1960, horses came into the Kentucky 
Derby after making an average of 21 starts apiece. By the 1990s, they had fewer 
than nine starts apiece before the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of possible explanations for this phenomenon -- the abuse of 
medication and a breeding industry that hasn't paid too much attention to 
soundness -- but whatever the reason, horses can't and don't run nearly as 
often as they used to. Too many tracks with too many rich races are trying to 
attract a dwindling number of top-class horses, and that's why six-horse stakes 
races have become so common. 
</P>
<P>
 It is because of the obvious low quality of recent thoroughbred crops that 
those in the sport have invested so much hope in the 3-year-old class of '94. 
Holy Bull, Brocco, Go For Gin, Blumin Affair, Smilin Singin Sam and others make 
this look like the strongest equine generation in many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Objective measurement, such as speed figures, confirm this opinion. It is 
highly unusual for 3-year-olds, at this early stage of their careers, to be 
running as well as good older horses. But all of the aforementioned colts have 
already earned bigger figures than Devil His Due this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-olds have generated excitement not only because they make the 
Triple Crown series so interesting, but also because these are the horses who 
will populate America's principal stakes races in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 If horses such as Holy Bull And Go for Gin fulfill their potential and stay in 
action as 4-year-olds, the Pimlico Special again will have the chance to offer 
the kind of races for which it was created.

GOLF ROUNDUP; SHEEHAN MOVES INTO SHARE OF LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patty Sheehan blew past the competition with a three-under-par 68 to gain a 
share of the lead after two rounds of the windswept LPGA Championship Friday at 
Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheehan, the defending champion, started the day in a 10-way tie for 17th 
place at 72. She had four birdies and one irksome bogey for a two-under 140 
total, and was tied with Robin Walton. 
</P>
<P>
 Walton offset a double-bogey and a bogey with four birdies for a 70. Alice 
Ritzman shot a 73 for a 141. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheehan, Walton and Ritzman were the only players under par after two trips 
over the 6,386-yard DuPont Country Club course. For a second consecutive day, 
players had to contend with swirling winds up to 30 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind gusted and came from everywhere," Ritzman said. "It seemed like it 
changed direction every five seconds. It was a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 The cut was at nine over, the highest on tour this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Butch Baird and Bobby Nichols, non-winners on the Senior PGA Tour since 1989, 
got off to good starts to possibly break the string at the PaineWebber 
Invitational at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols, who has come close to winning at the TPC at Piper Glen the previous 
two years, shot a six-under-par 66. Baird was the first to reach the clubhouse 
with that total as he birdied his last three holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Shaw and Dale Douglass were at 67. Arnold Palmer, who designed the course 
and is the designated host for the event, struggled to a 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Baird's last victory was in 1989 and he has only one top-10 finish in 29 
tournaments. Nichols is looking for his second victory on the Senior PGA Tour, 
which he and Baird both joined in 1986. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For the second day in a row, overnight rains washed out play in the Byron 
Nelson Classic at Dallas. More rain is forecast for the weekend as tournament 
organizers try to get in three rounds of play.

MISSION VIEJO TEACHERS PROTEST THE DEPICTION OF THEIR SCHOOL IN STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On May 4, the Times published a thinly veiled editorial by Jason Reid titled, 
"Diablos Having Devil of a Time;" unfortunately, this article, filled with 
half-truths and insidious innuendo, was printed as a news story about Mission 
Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
 For "one of the world's great newspapers" to make this mistake is 
unforgivable. By printing this gossip as fact you have demeaned the efforts of 
athletes, coaches, teachers and parents. The reader asks, "Is a disgruntled 
ex-assistant coach, who has made three unsuccessful attempts at becoming the 
head football coach, a reliable source? Did you investigate factors other than 
'the devil made us do it' in determining why we missed the football playoffs? 
With all the positive stories at MVHS, does missing these playoffs once deserve 
a front page headline?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even a freshmen journalism student would notice several inconsistencies. Could 
a principal who was a professional baseball player and is now an avid runner 
and tennis player be anti-athletics? Would a football coach, at a time when 
coaching jobs and coaches are at premium, be dismissed only because he 
disagreed on the depiction of the mascot? If the principal was the direct cause 
of the alleged "infighting," would 139 staff members and spouses have turned 
out for his salutary banquet last week? 
</P>
<P>
 Not a single phrase from the entire article was new news. Every paragraph 
twisted with old controversy, long since discussed, debated and hopefully 
rectified. The timing, as incoming ninth-graders choose their schools, could 
not be more inappropriate and damaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in administration should provide at least a few years without 
distraction from "education bashers" seeking to create issues where they do not 
exist. And if Jason Reid is looking for a truly newsworthy story, he should 
visit MVHS next week when the school will again be recognized by the state of 
California as one of its most outstanding schools.

MURRAY MAY BE RIGHT; BASEBALL SURELY ISN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 70, I have watched and listened to baseball since long before we could quit 
praying for radio reception static-free enough for us to follow the games. I 
still watch and listen, but only for the single stellar play, the rare 
meaningful game.I thank Jim Murray (May 8) for making it so clear why that is 
so.

 Jim Murray's diagnosis of modern baseball was a grand slam. It's no longer a 
game; it's a bank account. Mediocrity is rampant. Players paid a million a 
month for six months batting less than .200. Millionaire pitchers with losing 
records. With guaranteed pay, why bust your butt? 
</P>
<P>
 Games played at odd hours, day and night, on a pool-table surface. A juiced-up 
ball to revive interest. In the past, inept players ended up in the minors. Not 
today. With so many teams, any warm body is eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen Ruth, Gehrig, Ott and Hubbell play on grass in sunlight. I was a 
Giant fan in the '30s and '40s. There are no longer any giants, just greedy, 
puny pygmies. Fanatics who support this travesty are out by a mile.

 With 11 of USC's 30 football recruits not qualifying academically, it shows 
that John Robinson, with the blessing of Athletic Director Mike Garrett, has 
returned to the old days of USC by buying athletes at the cost of academics. 
It's not Robinson's dialogue we should listen to, because his actions speak for 
themselves.Garrett is a perfect cohort, having flourished in the days of dumb 
USC players, who reflected directly on USC's academic credibility. Win at all 
costs. It's a shame that Robinson, Garrett and USC subscribe to that 
philosophy.

 (Editor's note: In the Times story referred to by this reader, the figure of 
11 was misleading. Six of the 11 players referred to were still attending 
junior college, with a reasonable expectation of graduating and qualifying. 
Their lack of qualification remains merely an issue of time, not academic 
insolvency.)

TALK-SHOW HOST VOWS NOT TO KEEP QUIET

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Larry Stewart, 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half ago, when I was doing the all-night shift, you, just 
listening to some hearsay, and without checking the facts by calling me, 
attacked me in your newspaper column, by stating that I did not get the midday 
show because of my bad attitude around the station. 
</P>
<P>
 If you had only dialed my seven digits, you would have heard an entirely 
different story.When I was hired, I was promised Jim Lampley's time slot 
whenever he was unavailable. The program director did not follow through on 
that promise and as usual you did not check or do your homework. After your 
incorrect analysis in The Times, I went after you for your incompetence and 
lack of journalistic ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 And I promise you, on my four-hour daily national program, which is heard in 
50 cities around the nation, from Phoenix to Philadelphia, I will blast you and 
your newspaper hourly. I will blast you for writing all those lies. I will 
blast your newspaper that has refused to do the right thing and fire you. 
</P>
<P>
 Your column today, May 6, was beneath contempt. If the morning show was dour, 
you are the only one who thought so. It may not have been the best show in the 
world, but it wasn't the reason for the fall of KMPC.

 Slava Dosedel of the Czech Republic upset two-time defending champion and 
third-seeded Jim Courier, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, on Friday night in the quarterfinals 
of the Italian Open at Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Dosedel earned a berth in today's semifinals against top-seeded Pete Sampras, 
who extended his winning streak to 25 matches with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over 
Andrea Gaudenzi of Italy.Goran Ivanisevic will play Boris Becker in the other 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic defeated Jacco Eltingh of the Netherlands, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, and 
Becker advanced when his German rival, second-seeded Michael Stich, pulled out 
of the tournament a few hours before the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Stich cited a back ailment for his withdrawal, but he also had off-court 
distractions: His wife was stopped by police in Germany this week on suspicion 
of speeding and drunk driving, and his brother is getting married today.

 Mark Woodforde took advantage of a seemingly disinterested Ivan Lendl and

Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 On match point, Lendl took a wild swing at a second serve and hit the

 Joining Woodforde in the semifinals were fellow Aussie Jamie Morgan and 
Brazilians Fernando Meligeni and Luiz Mattar.

<P>
 Halard, ranked 28th, won four consecutive games during the third set to take a 
5-4 lead.

 Halard won the first two points against Graf's serve in the next game, but 
then netted an easy backhand volley. Graf was saved from facing three match

GEORGIA ON THEIR MIND: FANS SAY OWNER TURNED RAMS INTO A FARM CLUB

 You can't have it both ways, Georgia: "It ain't the soil that's less fertile

</P>
<P>
 Fifteen years of disastrous "leadership" of this once-proud NFL franchise has 
turned the team into the laughingstock of the league. Reasons for your team's 
current plight do not lie with the city leaders of Anaheim, the Southern 
California fans or even the ghost of Dan Reeves. More likely, player 
acquisitions and trades (not to mention coaching choices during the last 12 
years) involving the names Bartkowski, Brock, Hill (both Kent and Drew), 
Everett, Dickerson, Evans, Gary, Henley, Green, Lansford, might provide an 
oracle of light on your team's perennially dismal condition. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Georgia, the blame falls squarely on you and your inability to further 
develop an L.A. fixture. You reap what you sow and your field of dreams has 
dried up. See ya!

 In view of some of the egomaniacal nut cases who own pro sports franchises in 
this country -- notably in Cincinnati, Washington and Dallas -- she comes 
across as a very classy lady with no need to apologize to anyone.

CHAVEZ VICTORY HAS READERS FIGHTING MAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all of you who think Julio Cesar Chavez is a great fighter, I'll let you 
in on a little secret: He got whipped by Pernell Whitaker, and was twice 
soundly beaten by Frankie Randall. The only reason Chavez is still champion is 
because of Don King's money.He has bought Chavez the title.

 Dr. Flip Homansky's lack of ring savvy wreaked havoc on boxing on May 7. It's 
bad enough championship fights don't go 15 rounds. Now Homansky's ruling in the 
Julio Cesar Chavez-Frankie Randall fight strikes a low blow at what little 
integrity boxing has left. 
</P>
<P>
 Ringside's Dr. Death stopped the fight in the eighth round with three seconds 
left. He stopped the fight because Chavez said he didn't want to continue. 
Incredible. Of course, Don King loved it. His hair sizzled. Another grudge 
match. Another payday.

NBA PLAYOFFS / WESTERN CONFERENCE SEMIFINALS; THIS TIME, ROCKETS RALLY TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After blowing a big lead in the fourth quarter in record-breaking fashion in 
Game 2 of the NBA Western Conference semifinal playoffs, the Houston Rockets 
began Game 3 as if they wanted to avoid the rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they overcame a lead themselves, getting 31 of Vernon Maxwell's 34 points 
in the second half Friday and 26 points and 15 rebounds from Hakeem Olajuwon in 
a 118-102 victory at Phoenix to cut the Suns' lead in the series to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston had blown a 20-point fourth-quarter lead in losing Game 2, then fell 
behind, 29-15, in the first quarter Friday, 49-41 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maxwell had 15 points in the third quarter and added 16 more in the 
fourth, including a three-pointer with 1:51 to play that gave the Rockets a 
112-102 lead after Phoenix twice cut its deficit to seven points on 
three-pointers by A.C. Green and Kevin Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon then grabbed a loose ball under the Suns basket and fed a driving 
Maxwell for a layup that put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 4 of the series is Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Otis Thorpe scored 16 points, helping the Rockets fend off a 38-point effort 
by Johnson, who had 26 of those points in a second-half shootout with Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley had 18 points for the Suns.

A PACK OF TROUBLE; FORMER USC GUARD PRESENTS BIG PROBLEMS FOR NUGGET OPPONENTS 
AS EXPLOSIVE SIXTH MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When guard Robert Pack left USC in 1991 after helping the Trojans to their 
first NCAA playoff berth in six seasons, few thought he had a chance to play in 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Portland Trail Blazers invited Pack to training camp at the request of 
Trojan Coach George Raveling after Pack had played well in the L.A. Summer Pro 
League  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I had the talent to be drafted, and if not drafted at least invited to 
someone's (rookie-free agent) camp," Pack said. "That's hurt me more than not 
being drafted. Not being invited to someone's camp makes you feel like you 
weren't even noticed at all in college." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pack is being noticed now. 
</P>
<P>
 Now with the Denver Nuggets, he has blossomed into one of the NBA's most 
explosive sixth men. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Pack, 25, plays as if he's still trying to prove he belongs in the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one gave me a chance to be in the league," Pack said. "I didn't get a shot 
in any camps, but I was real confident that I could play and I didn't give up 
and that's really important. I think I have a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pack's emergence has astonished many NBA observers, Raveling isn't 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's been working at his game every summer," Raveling said. "He's 
been trying to refine his game. I'm not really surprised because Robert has a 
tremendous desire to succeed and he's willing to work hard to achieve it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pack, who was traded to the Nuggets by Portland last season, helped propel 
Denver to one of the biggest upsets in NBA playoff history. They eliminated the 
Seattle SuperSonics in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time that a No. 1-seeded team was eliminated by a No. 8. The 
SuperSonics had the NBA's best regular-season record, 63-19; the Nuggets and 
Miami Heat had the worst records of any playoff teams, 42-40.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Nuggets will try to bounce back from a 2-0 deficit in their 
second-round series with the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Seattle, Pack outplayed All-Star guard Gary Payton in the decisive 
fifth game, scoring a career-high 23 points, 22 after halftime, as the Nuggets 
eliminated the SuperSonics, 98-94, in overtime. It was Seattle's first home 
loss in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Nuggets trailing late in the third quarter, 62-53, Pack scored nine 
points as Denver outscored Seattle, 13-2, and took the lead for the first time. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Pack, who had made six three-point shots during the regular season, made six 
in the final three games, three of them in the deciding game and two of those 
in the fourth quarter as the Nuggets took an eight-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three-point shots weren't planned, it was just something I had to do," 
Pack said. "I was wide open and I had to take them and, fortunately, they went 
down for me." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Nuggets leading in overtime, 96-94, Pack stole the ball from Payton 
with 54 seconds left but his shot was blocked by Shawn Kemp. Then he sealed the 
victory by making two free throws with 18 seconds left after center Dikembe 
Mutombo blocked a shot by Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
 After averaging nine points during the regular season, Pack averaged 15.7 
points in Denver's three victories over Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how to explain it, but I know I can run the team and play the 
game," Pack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pack has demonstrated it during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 With Denver on the verge of being eliminated in Game 4, Pack sank a 
three-point shot with 27 seconds left, sending the game into overtime, and the 
Nuggets went on to win, 94-85.  
</P>
<P>
 Pack, who was nicknamed "Left-out Larry" after complaining that he didn't get 
enough playing time during the regular season, has gotten more playing time 
than starter Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf in the playoffs. Even though Abdul-Rauf has 
struggled in the playoffs, shooting only 32.8%, the Nuggets don't plan to start 
Pack in his place. That doesn't faze Pack. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to become a starter in this league," he said. "I haven't put a lot 
of thought into it because at this point in time, thinking about starting could 
hurt me. I don't control the minutes, it's up to the coach to make that 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Pack could become a starter, but perhaps not in Denver, where there is 
speculation the Nuggets will package him with their first-round draft pick in a 
trade for a veteran point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been (trade) rumors, but I've tried to stay focused," Pack said. "If 
that's what happens, I'll just have to deal with it. If it turns out to be a 
move where I'm not here and I do get a chance to start, I'm going to take 
advantage of that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Denver Coach Dan Issel isn't surprised that Pack has played so well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've got guys who sit on the bench and some nights get a lot of 
minutes and other nights don't get a lot, I think being a professional is to 
keep yourself prepared and be ready when your opportunity comes," Issel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you put Robert in a game, something always happens. Sometimes it's good 
and sometimes it's bad and (sometimes it's) terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pack is an explosive scorer who seems to energize the Nuggets, he is 
inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he averaged 9.6 points and a team-high 5.4 assists this season, he 
also averaged a team-high 3.1 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pack maintains that he commits so many turnovers because he is under pressure 
when he gets into the game and takes risks.  
</P>
<P>
 "I get ahead of myself, trying to make things happen right away," he said. "If 
I started, I'd be more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 Pack was runner-up behind Minnesota rookie guard Isaiah Rider in the NBA 
slam-dunk contest in February, but he hasn't perfected his jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked a lot on my jump shot last summer, trying to improve it, because I 
knew that if I could hit that outside shot guys would have to come out on me 
and then I could use my quickness to blow by them," Pack said. "When Tim 
Hardaway came in the league, he wasn't the greatest shooter, but he improved 
his (jump shot) and it opened his game up. 
</P>
<P>
 "My shot didn't fall (during the regular) season, but I never lost confidence. 
I continued to shoot and last Saturday it all paid off." 
</P>
<P>
 He has also developed a reputation for being irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been late for buses and was fined after skipping a shoot-around before 
a game at Dallas last month. Pack maintained that he missed the team bus by a 
few minutes, but team officials contended that he could have taken a cab to the 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Nuggets will live with Pack's flaws, at least for the time being, 
because of his explosiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 He signed a three-year, $3-million contract with Denver last December, after 
sitting out the first 13 games of the season in a contract holdout. 
</P>
<P>
 Pack used some of the money to buy a new van for his mother, Wilma, and a new 
truck for his father, Robert Sr. He's also building them a house in Tacoma, 
Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom worked her fingers to the bone cleaning people's houses," Pack said. 
"There'd be times when she'd work two jobs and she'd come home from one job and 
be home an hour and be gone to the next and I'd hardly get a chance to see her. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be able to have her sit down and enjoy a new house and a new car is really 
gratifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Pack's parents moved to Tacoma from New Orleans after Pack had started 
college. Pack grew up in a tough part of New Orleans, the same area where San 
Diego State tailback Marshall Faulk lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up there, you had to be tough, but I think those tough areas helped 
me to fight through a lot of tough things that have happened in my life, like 
not being drafted," Pack said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that if you got knocked down, you had to get back up."

NATIONAL LEAGUE; DRABEK NOW PAYING DIVIDENDS FOR ASTROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe the thrill and the pressure that accompany a big free-agent contract 
have worn off. Maybe he has simply gotten comfortable pitching indoors. Maybe 
he has developed a liking for barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Drabek doesn't know why he's winning again after his 9-18 record last 
year, his first at Houston after a long career with the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, I've been a lot smoother and more consistent," Drabek said 
Friday night after his four-hitter led the Astros past the Colorado Rockies, 
4-2, at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Drabek (5-1) won his fifth consecutive decision. He gave up homers by Andres 
Galarraga in the second inning and Ellis Burks in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been able to use all my pitches more effectively," Drabek said. "I feel 
a lot more like I did the year before last, and that's a great feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Bagwell, the NL leader in RBIs with 37, homered into the fourth of five 
decks off Marvin Freeman (3-1) in the seventh inning for a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got right back in it at 2-2 and then I go out there and throw it right 
down the middle," Freeman said of Bagwell's homer. "I deserve to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Drabek deserved to win, said Colorado Manager Don Baylor. "He's not the 
pitcher he was last year. He throws a lot more fastballs and moves it around. 
Last year guys sat on his breaking ball. They couldn't do that tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 12, Pittsburgh 1 -- Mariano Duncan drove in four runs at 
Philadelphia and Danny Jackson (5-0) won his fifth consecutive decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenny Dykstra went four for four -- giving him seven hits in two nights -- and 
scored four runs as the Phillies won for only the third time in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 9, St. Louis 1 -- Mike Lansing went four for five with two doubles 
and a home run for the Expos at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Fassero (3-2) gave up three hits in six innings and John Wetteland got 
four outs for only his second save in six chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozzie Smith homered in the fourth inning, his first home run since May 30, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 7, New York 2 -- Tom Glavine (4-3) gave up three hits in 7 2/3 innings 
at New York as the Braves stretched their winning streak to four games. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 9, Cincinnati 5 -- Barry Bonds hit a three-run homer and had 
four RBIs, and Willie McGee hit an inside-the-park homer and drove in three 
runs for the Giants at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants scored four unearned runs in the second inning, taking a 5-1 lead 
after a throwing error by third baseman Lenny Harris on Todd Benzinger's 
grounder. Cincinnati made four errors in all -- two by Harris -- leading to six 
unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 6, Florida 4 -- Mark Grace's two-run single sparked a five-run seventh 
inning, and Willie Banks (3-4) pitched a strong game for the Cubs, who won at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Grace's bases-loaded hit off reliever Yorkis Perez scored Tuffy Rhodes and 
Shawon Dunston to give the Cubs a 3-2 lead. Derrick May followed with a 
run-scoring single before Grace scored on a wild pitch by Richie Lewis, and Rey 
Sanchez added a run-scoring hit.

AMERICAN LEAGUE; BLUE JAYS HAVE TO LOOK UPHILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a pattern set in the first six weeks of a season, and Paul Molitor 
doesn't like what he sees for the Toronto Blue Jays, who are seeking their 
third consecutive American League pennant. 
</P>
<P>
 "After you're 35 games into the season, you should be starting to build, but 
right now we're going in the opposite direction," Molitor said Friday night 
after the Blue Jays were beaten by the Red Sox's Joe Hesketh and five 
relievers, 5-3, at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was fourth-place Toronto's fourth in a row and 13th in its last 18 
games, in which the Blue Jays have been outscored, 100-70. Worse, it came 
against an AL East rival, perhaps a sign of the times. After a winning record 
against teams in the Central and West divisions, the Blue Jays are 0-4 against 
the East. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a struggle for us. Our production has been down significantly since 
the early stages of the season," said Molitor, who had a bases-empty homer. "It 
magnifies every mistake our pitching staff makes. We don't want to get too far 
behind, because it's tough enough to catch one team, let alone three." 
</P>
<P>
 Hesketh (2-1) gave up two runs and six hits as he won at Fenway Park for the 
first time since April 17, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Then began a parade of relievers ending with Ken Ryan, who worked the ninth 
inning for his third save and Boston's fourth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Otis Nixon drove in two runs for the Red Sox with a bunt single and an infield 
hit. Carlos Rodriguez had an RBI double and made two diving catches at 
shortstop for the Red Sox, and Mike Greenwell and Billy Hatcher added 
run-scoring singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 4, Baltimore 1 -- Kirby Puckett hit a two-run homer in the sixth 
inning at Minneapolis to hand Ben McDonald (7-1) his first loss of the season, 
even though McDonald carried a one-hitter into the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Puckett's homer, his fifth, gave Twin starter Pat Mahomes (3-1) a 2-1 lead, 
and Puckett helped it stand up by scaling the right-center field fence to rob 
Chris Hoiles of an extra-base hit in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Knoblauch's ground-rule double in the sixth inning was the first 
hard-hit ball against McDonald. After Alex Cole struck out, Puckett lined a 
McDonald fastball over the center-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 2, Detroit 0 -- Mark Clark pitched his first American League shutout 
and kept Tim Belcher winless in eight starts as the Indians won at home to stop 
a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit lost the opener of a six-game trip after going 9-2 on its home stand. 
Cleveland returned home from a 1-7 trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark (3-1), who had lasted only 1 2/3 innings in his previous start, gave up 
six hits, walked five and struck out three in Cleveland's first shutout of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Belcher (0-7) gave up two runs and six hits but became the first Detroit 
pitcher to lose his first seven decisions in a season since Ted Gray lost nine 
in a row at the start of 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 16, Oakland 6 -- Mark Gubicza (2-3) went 7 2/3 innings at Kansas 
City in his longest outing in two years and Mike Macfarlane, Terry Shumpert and 
Gary Gaetti hit home runs for the Royals, who handed the Athletics their 21st 
loss in 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 10, Milwaukee 4 -- Bernie Williams, Pat Kelly and Luis Polonia each 
drove in two runs in the 12th inning at Milwaukee as the Yankees won their 
eighth game in a row and 18th in their last 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees, who improved their major league-best record to 24-10, are off to 
their best start since opening the 1958 season 25-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 11, Chicago 7 -- Juan Gonzalez went four for five with four RBIs at 
Arlington, Tex., leading the Rangers past the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez hit a two-run triple in the first inning and added three singles for 
the eighth four-hit game of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddibe McDowell went three for four with two steals for the Rangers, who 
banged out 14 hits.

 Tiffany Boykin highlighted the Orange County contingent at the Southern 
Section Division III track and field preliminaries Friday night at Long Beach 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Hills junior ran away from the field early, winning the 800 meters 
in 2 minutes 18.15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fastest time of the evening, edging Trabuco Hills standout Peggy 
Hall by over two seconds. Hall was the second-fastest qualifier (2:20.51) and 
also qualified for the 400 final (1:00.42). 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted a fast time today, but I guess I ran a dumb race," said Boykin, who 
ran the opening 400 lap in a blistering 1:04.2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I slowed down too much in the third 200. I really couldn't judge how fast I 
was running," added Boykin, who has the county's second-fastest time in the 
event this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Her teammates Tayyiba Haneef (high jump) and Heather McGlone (3,200 meters) 
easily qualified for next Saturday's section finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Other County highlights included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trabuco Hills' girls' 400-meter relay squad qualified in a season-fastest 
49.79. Mustang sprinter Rosie Manning also qualified for the 200-meter final, 
in 26.0. Manning also qualified with a wind-aided season-best in the 100 meters 
(12.40). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Laguna Hills' hurdler Shaheed Qassim ran 15.0 in the 110 highs and 40.70 in 
the 300 intermediates, easily advancing in both. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Estancia junior Johann Appell easily qualified in the 3,200, posting a 
career-best of 9:31.24. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Laguna Hills' discus thrower Jesse MacDonald posted the second-best mark in 
the competition, qualifying for the divisional final with a 154-foot-2 effort. 
Century senior Ronny Aristando also qualified for next week's discus final.

PREP SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; MARINA PITCHER CROUCH MAKES HUNTINGTON BEACH FEEL THE 
PAIN 
</P>

<P>
 Marcy Crouch's sciatica was acting up, and Marina's trainer suggested she rest 
Friday. But Crouch wanted to pitch and Coach Shelly Luth wasn't going to deny 
her the opportunity.Crouch then went out and dominated Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch won her 17th game -- she gave up only a first-inning single and retired 
the final 19 batters as Marina scored a 1-0 Sunset League victory. The 
top-ranked Vikings (21-2, 13-1 in league) virtually assured themselves the 
top-seeding in next week's Division I playoffs. Huntington Beach (15-9, 9-5) 
finished fourth; the seventh-ranked Oilers should get an at-large playoff 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Krill was the only batter to reach base against Crouch, who got the 
run she needed in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Flowers got aboard on an error and took second when Angela Alvarez 
bunted safely. An out later, Crouch's swinging bunt was fielded by pitcher 
Stefanie Noffsinger (8-2), who flipped the ball toward first base -- but it 
went awry. Flowers scored from second on the throwing error. MARTIN HENDERSON

<P>
 Huntington Beach defeated visiting Marina, 6-4, Friday to earn the Sunset 
League's final automatic berth for the Southern Section Division I baseball 
playoffs, knocking out Marina in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach (18-9, 8-6 in league) finished third behind Servite and 
champion Fountain Valley.Marina ends the season 17-10, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers took the lead with three runs in the third inning. Trailing, 5-0, 
in the sixth, Marina scored four runs but stranded the potential tying and 
go-ahead runs. Huntington Beach added a run in the bottom of the sixth, when 
pinch-runner Brett Fish scored from third on a delayed double steal. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach received a strong performance from junior right-hander Ryan 
Evans (4-0), who was making his first start. Evans, who had not previously 
pitched more than two innings in one appearance, held Marina scoreless through 
five innings. Viking left-handed senior starter Jim Sipkovich (5-4) took the 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans was relieved with two outs in the sixth after giving up two runs. Senior 
left-hander Bryce Dillard, who started in left field, pitched a scoreless 
seventh to earn his second save. Dillard also drove in two runs with sacrifice 
flies. JASON H. REID

SEA VIEW LEAGUE BASEBALL RACE NARROWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sea View League race to determine the league's Nos. 2 and 3 
representatives for the Southern Section Division III baseball playoffs became 
a little less crowded Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin won the league title, but five teams finished tied for second.Athletic 
directors from those schools held a lottery Friday morning, drawing four 
numbers out of a hat. As a result, four teams played Friday afternoon and 
Irvine received a bye. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar defeated Woodbridge, 2-1, and Saddleback beat Santa Margarita, 
7-4. Saddleback then won a coin toss with Corona del Mar to gain a playoff 
berth. Corona del Mar will play Irvine today at Tustin High School at 2 p.m., 
with the winner also qualifying for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nos. 2 and 3 spots will be determined by regular-season head-to-head 
competition, with Corona del Mar getting the No. 2 berth if it wins Saturday 
and Saddleback the No. 2 berth if Irvine wins. A league's third-place team is 
almost guaranteed a first-round playoff game on the road.

MATADORS LET DEFENSE DOWN IN 12-4 DEFEAT; COLLEGE BASEBALL: NORTHRIDGE COMMITS 
FIVE ERRORS, IS ALL BUT ELIMINATED FROM RACE IN LOSS TO FRESNO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sooner or later. 
</P>
<P>
 Keyaan Cook said it. Bill Kernen echoed the thought. 
</P>
<P>
 After Friday night's debacle, both would have preferred later, no question 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge, playing with a patchwork defense, committed five errors 
-- three in a nine-run inning -- as Fresno State hammered the Matadors, 12-4, 
in a Western Athletic Conference West Division game before 4,142 at Beiden 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (25-28, 12-10 in conference play) must win the remaining two games 
of the series, the season finale for both teams, to have any shot at the West 
Division title and the NCAA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors fell a game behind hard-charging Fresno State (34-23, 13-9) and 
two behind first-place San Diego State (34-22, 14-8) -- which scored twice in 
the ninth to edge Cal State Sacramento, 8-7, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State has won 13 of its last 14. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the past three weeks, since an elbow injury to shortstop Chad 
Thornhill forced another lineup shuffle, the patchwork defense held up fairly 
well, all things considered. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, nothing went right. Cook, who before Thornhill's injury 
hadn't played shortstop since his senior season at Montclair Prep in 1990, 
committed three errors in the fourth inning as the Bulldogs scored a 
season-high nine runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, normally a starter at second base, had only made one error at short in 
five starts since Thornhill's injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sooner or later, it all sifts itself out," said Kernen, the Northridge coach. 
"When you're out of position, sooner or later the ball's going to find you." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook shook his head and shrugged his shoulders. He didn't ask for the 
assignment, but has been giving it best shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing you can do," Cook said. "We don't have a lot of options. I've 
been fielding pretty well all season without many problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Brian Vasey had allowed two hits entering the fourth, but in a 
precursor of the carnage to come, the defense made two errors behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fateful, ignominious fourth, Fresno State sent 12 batters to the plate 
as the Bulldogs blotted out a 4-0 Northridge lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Curtis, Noel Roberts and James Borges each doubled in the inning and 
Bryan Judice capped the rally with a monstrous two-run homer over the 400-foot 
sign in dead center. In all, the Bulldogs had six hits in the inning -- four 
for extra bases -- though five of the runs were unearned. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey (1-3) allowed 11 runs, six earned, on 11 hits over 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth was deflating for more than the obvious. In addition to the errors, 
the Matadors also blew a four-run lead against one of the WAC's toughest 
pitchers, ace right-hander Tommy Minor, who entered the game with an earned-run 
average of 2.60. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, before Minor (11-4) recorded the second out, Northridge had rolled up 
10 total bases to take a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Eric Gillespie opened the game with a double and Joey Arnold 
duplicated the feat to give the Matadors a 1-0 lead. After a groundout moved 
Arnold to third, he was doubled home on a 400-foot blast off the center-field 
fence by Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Josh Smaler ripped an opposite-field homer over the fence in right 
that landed among several dozen fans in the stadium's picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Northridge managed only five hits after the first, two of which never 
left the infield.

NORTHRIDGE, FANS HAVE A FIELD DAY; COLLEGE SOFTBALL: PLAYING TO STAY AT HOME, 
MATADORS SWEEP FRESNO AND GRAB WAC LEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Winning the Western Athletic Conference softball title was never a top 
priority for Cal State Northridge. The Matadors' No. 1 goal is to play host to 
one of eight NCAA Division I regional tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 With a little help from Utah on Friday, the Matadors took a giant step toward 
attaining both by sweeping Fresno State, 1-0 and 2-0, in front of 615. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (44-7, 19-3 in WAC play) moved into first place by beating Fresno 
State (43-14, 19-5) for the third time in four games. Utah (44-10, 20-4) split 
with New Mexico and dropped into second place by percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Games called off because of inclement weather will not be made up, so the 
conference title could be determined by winning percentage. Northridge plays 
host to Cal State Sacramento, Colorado State is at Utah and Fresno State visits 
San Diego State today in season-ending doubleheaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-ranked Matadors know what home-field advantage means. For Fresno 
State Coach Margie Wright, playing at Northridge means enduring heckling from 
the Matamaniacs, a boisterous group of Northridge athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are real tough conditions to play under," said Wright, who midway 
through the second game complained to Barry Smith, Northridge sports 
information director, that she was "being called every name in the book" by 
fans near the left-field foul line. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently the fans had the Bulldogs -- who were shut out for only the third 
and fourth times this season -- shook up as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd hope that players at this level would be able to focus with anything," 
Wright said. "I think you have to be ready to play under any condition. We just 
lost focus on what we came to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile the Matadors were enjoying the support. After Scia Maumausolo's home 
run over a 15-foot high scoreboard in left-center field in the second game, 
Matamaniacs sitting on cars beyond the fence rose and bowed in unison to 
Maumausolo. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Coach Gary Torgeson started sophomore right-hander Jennifer 
Richardson in the opener over ace Amy Windmiller, who beat the Bulldogs in 
Fresno six weeks ago. But while he was hoping to surprise Fresno State with 
Richardson, the Bulldogs appeared undaunted, loading the bases with none out in 
the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson (9-0) responded by retiring the side on two strikeouts and a force 
out at home.

GRANADA HILLS PUTS UP FIGHT BUT FALLS IN FINAL

 Say this for the Granada Hills High boys' volleyball team: the Highlanders 
stared into the abyss twice at the City Section 4-A Division championship and 
didn't flinch. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't win, but they did not go gently into that good night, mounting two 
comebacks against powerful University before falling, 15-11, 15-2, 9-15, 15-10, 
Friday night at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we played our hearts out," Granada Hills Coach Tom Harp said. "We 
have nothing to be ashamed of. We certainly didn't lose because of lack of 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders came out on the short end of a tense, excellently played first 
game, couldn't regroup and played horribly in game two, registering no kills -- 
an almost unheard-of statistic. 
</P>
<P>
 But facing an embarrassing sweep, they came alive in game three. Earnest Yun 
had four kills and two solo blocks, and Mike DiSimone, the team's leader all 
season, chipped in with three kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a strong comeback," said DiSimone, who had 18 kills. "I thought we'd 
come back even stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills (15-2) trailed, 14-5, in game four, but instead of folding won a 
crucial side out and scored five consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 The match ended when Granada Hills' Ryan Kamins dived over the center line for 
a loose ball. Point, game, and match to University (15-1). 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fifth City championship for the Warriors, who were led by Raoul 
Williams' 26 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills won the 3-A championship in 1986 and 1987, and lost the 4-A 
title in 1991.

GILMAN HELPS BUENA GIRLS SWIM OFF WITH TEAM TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It didn't take long for the Buena High girls' swimming team to establish 
itself as the school to beat in the Southern Section Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs, led by freshman Rebecca Gilman, swept the first three events 
Friday night at Belmont Plaza to take a commanding lead for the team 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilman won two individual events and swam a leg on a winning relay to lead the 
Bulldogs to a convincing team victory with 221 points, 66 points over 
second-place Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena dominated the opening event, the 200-yard medley relay, defeating 
second-place Los Alamitos by more than two seconds with an All-American time of 
1:48.77. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first three events, the Bulldogs already had a 51-point lead over 
the next-closest team. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second event, Gilman came from behind in the final 50 yards to win the 
200-yard freestyle in 1:49.21, only .09 ahead of Katie Lowes of El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got to 150 (yards) and saw her ahead, I'd thought I'd lost." Gilman 
said. "I'm usually better in longer races but I've been doing better in the 200 
lately." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the evening, Gilman showed she hadn't lost her touch in the longer 
distances by winning the 500-yard freestyle by more than four seconds, with a 
time of 4:53.05. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Melissa Roarty had the second-slowest preliminary time in the 200 
individual medley, but still won from the outside lane for the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena senior Mandy Walz won the 100 backstroke with a time of 56.58. Walz also 
finished second in the 100 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 John Lory won the first title for the Buena boys' team with a time of 1:52.11 
in the 200 IM. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not as deep as the girls and we don't have the relays but we're still 
strong," Lory said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena was the highest area boy's team, tied for seventh place. Royal finished 
ninth among girls.

PREP ROUNDUP; NEWPORT HARBOR GETS AROUND FOUNTAIN VALLEY

 Newport Harbor Coach Dan Glenn breathed a sigh of relief Friday after his team 
beat visiting Fountain Valley in the first round of the Southern Section 
Division I boys' volleyball playoffs, 15-10, 15-5, 13-15, 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing to Corona del Mar in the Sea View League final -- the Sailors 
shared the league title with the Sea Kings -- Glenn said he was afraid his team 
might be primed for an upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real nervous," Glenn said. "Fountain Valley is real young and real 
good, and plus losing that last match was real disappointing. But, the kids 
came back well tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first three games, the Sailors (14-4) jumped out to early leads. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor led, 12-3, in the first game, but Fountain Valley (12-5) scored 
six consecutive points before the Sailors put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors then won the second game with ease, but the Barons fought back in 
the third game after trailing, 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley closed out its comeback by scoring the final six points. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of runs," Glenn said. "Both teams made a lot of mistakes 
though." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors put together their biggest run in the fourth game, when they 
scored 10 points, taking a 10-3 lead. Mitch McCoy had four aces during the 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy finished with a match-high 15 kills and Eric Vallely had 11 for the 
Sailors. Ed Ratledge led Fountain Valley with 14 kills. PETER BARZILAI

DIGEST: NABA BACK ON THE FIELD AT NEWBURY PARK AND SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks chapter of the National Adult Baseball Assn. has been 
granted approval to continue playing Sunday games at Newbury Park and Simi 
Valley highs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Conejo Valley and Simi Valley school districts cleared the 
league to play games provided the NABA make payments directly to the school 
districts rather than the schools' baseball programs. In addition, the NABA was 
asked to increase the amount of insurance coverage for using the Simi Valley 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 A fee for use of the fields is still being negotiated, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NABA was forced to revise its procedures after coaches at Newbury Park and 
Simi Valley last week admitted accepting cash or equipment from the group as 
payment for field use. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have met all the requirements set forth by both school districts," said 
Jeff Richardson, director of the Thousand Oaks chapter of the NABA. "We should 
be playing at Newbury Park this weekend, and we should be at Newbury Park 
and/or Simi Valley the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said the NABA is negotiating with the Las Virgenes Unified School 
District regarding use of the Agoura High field. Colleges  
</P>
<P>
 Although the Mission College budget for the 1994-95 school year does not 
include funds for athletics, school administrators are confident they can raise 
money to keep the sports programs alive, according to John Klitsner, athletic 
director and baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took it out of the budget, but I was at a meeting where the president of 
the college (Jack Fujimoto) said that athletics would go on as always, that we 
didn't have the budget but we would find the funds," Klitsner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Klitsner said the school's athletic budget in 1993-94 was about $65,000. The 
school fields teams in men's and women's cross-country, men's golf, soccer and 
baseball. There are plans to add women's golf to the list next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Klitsner said the school will seek funds from private contributions and 
fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 David Humphreys, assistant men's basketball coach at The Master's College, has 
been named the school's sports information director. Humphreys, a point guard 
at Master's from 1989-93, replaces Chris Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, the Mustangs' baseball coach for the past four seasons, was relieved 
of his job last month after compiling an 83-100-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphreys will continue as a basketball assistant under Coach Bill Oates. 
Football  
</P>
<P>
 Don Shoemaker, who in 1990 led Glendale High to its only Pacific League 
football championship, has resigned as coach after six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker, 35, who joined Glendale as an assistant coach in 1976, said he grew 
tired of the demands of coaching. He will remain a science teacher at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great school, I just really needed a change of pace," Shoemaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker said he has not ruled out a return to coaching in the future. Bruce 
Dalton, the school's athletic director, said he was unprepared for Shoemaker's 
resignation and that a successor won't likely be named soon. "We're trying to 
work as fast as possible," Dalton said. "We're really still at a formative 
stage as to what we're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker, who posted a 40-23 record during his tenure, led the Dynamiters to 
a 10-0 mark in 1990 before the team lost to Camarillo in the opening round of 
the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Bears youth football program has scheduled signups today at Babe 
Herman Field and Montrose Park. The program is open to all players and 
cheerleaders age 6 through 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Information: 818-541-0421. Basketball  
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore High has hired Harold Burns as boys' coach. Burns replaces John 
Wilber, now Fillmore's head football coach. Burns coached Fillmore's girls' 
basketball team from 1975-81.

 Sara Works performed plenty of heroic acts this spring in leading the Cypress 
women's basketball team to the State tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Works is helping the softball team move in that direction.Her pinch-hit 
double broke a tie and gave Cypress a 4-3 victory over El Camino in the second 
round of the Southern California playoffs Friday at Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Works came up with two outs and drove the ball into the gap in right center to 
score Sonya Fellows. Jennifer Allchin had started the seventh with a single but 
was forced by Fellows. Kristi Krebs sacrificed Fellows to second, bringing up 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking double into right center," Cypress Coach Brad Pickler said. 
"Sometimes you can just see it in your mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The double Pickler didn't plan on came in the top of the seventh. El Camino's 
Jennifer Dessert lined a two-run double into right center to tie it, 3-3. 
Sherry Thomas had singled in a run in the inning for El Camino (21-18). 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (42-15) had beaten Pasadena, 4-0, earlier in the day and needs one 
victory today to advance to the State tournament for the sixth consecutive 
season. Cypress won the State title in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Lopez (21-9) pitched complete games in both Cypress victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley, which lost to El Camino, 2-0, in eight innings Friday, plays 
Pasadena at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner plays El Camino at noon and the winner of that game meets Cypress 
at 2 p.m. The Chargers would have to lose twice to be eliminated. STEVE KRESAL

 Sandy Zubrin of Corona del Mar calmly won her third consecutive Southern 
Section Championship Friday at Heritage Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing little emotion, except for a small grin, Zubrin, 17, scored 529.25, 
never scoring lower than a 6.On her sixth-round dive, a reverse pike, she drew 
three 9s and followed with an inward pike that earned four 8.5s. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Zubrin's impressive performance, second-place Laura Segundo of 
Arcadia finished only 21 points behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scores were really close this year," said Zubrin, winner of the 1993 
Summer Nationals. "This year's competition was better than in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 40 points separated third-place Erin McGinty (485.95), a junior from 
Santa Margarita, and teammate Caroline Kelley (445.40) in seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora's Aaron Jenkins won the boys' event with 464.45, 66 points ahead of 
second-place Peter Kransz of Sunny Hills. Jenkins led from the beginning, 
scoring 6.5-7.5 on his first dive, a forward pike. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Sonora boys finished among the top eight. Jason Jass (397.20) finished 
third, Larry Neberman (363.20) sixth and Jeff Stewart (355.75) eighth. Troy's 
Derek Mittenzwei was fourth (386.00). MELANIE NEFF

MERRITT'S HEAVE PUTS RIVALS THROUGH HOOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darvena Merritt of North Hollywood High earned All-City Section 4-A Division 
honors in basketball last season, but she won't be shooting hoops for some time 
if she continues to put the shot like she did in Friday's Valley Pac-8 
Conference track and field finals at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-place finisher in the City championships as a sophomore, Merritt 
improved her personal best to 37 feet 4 inches as a junior last year and was 
regarded as the front-runner for the City title until she broke two fingers on 
her throwing hand in a pickup basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 "After making it to City as a sophomore, I really wanted to win it all last 
year," said Merritt, who won the Pac-8 title Friday with a heave of 42-0. "But 
the injury ended my season." 
</P>
<P>
 Merritt has converted that disappointment into motivation and it has paid off. 
She cracked the 40-foot barrier last month and set a personal best on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the best mark by a City athlete since Erin McConahey of Van Nuys put 
the shot 42-2 3/4 in 1989. "I had no idea about the shotput when I started two 
years ago," Merritt admitted. "But once I started competing, I began to get 
more serious. . . . Basketball had always been the No. 1 sport with me, but I 
like track more than basketball now." 
</P>
<P>
 Merritt also placed second in the triple jump (32-10 1/4) and ran a leg on 
North Hollywood's second-place 400-meter relay team (52.4 seconds) as the top 
five finishers in each event qualified for Thursday's City preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham, second in last year's City championships, won eight of 15 events 
in the boys' meet, led by James Lincoln's three victories and Marvin Powell's 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln, a senior, was upset by Powell in the 110 high hurdles, 15.1 to 15.4, 
to start the meet, but he rebounded with victories in the high jump (6-2), long 
jump (personal best of 22-2 3/4) and triple jump (43-10). 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, a junior, added a victory in the 300 intermediate hurdles with a 
personal best of 41.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe's Jose Padilla ran 4 minutes 27 seconds in the 1,600 and 9:48.7 in the 
3,200 to easily win those events.

CRESPI STAYS ALIVE TO PLAY ANOTHER DAY; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: CELTS HOLD ON TO 
BEAT CHAMINADE, 8-7, FACE EAGLES AGAIN TODAY WITH PLAYOFF BERTH ON THE LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There was a lot riding on Friday's Mission League game at Valley College 
between Chaminade and Crespi highs, which are fighting for the league's third 
and final Division I baseball playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade could have clinched its first postseason appearance since moving to 
the Mission League in 1990, but Crespi would have none of that. The Celts hung 
on for an 8-7 victory that forced today's 1 p.m. tiebreaker between the teams 
at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing isn't exactly the best for Chaminade, which held its senior prom on 
Friday night. Coach Dave Desmond, however, did not enforce a curfew for his 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our guys can find their way back from the prom, we will win," Desmond 
said. "All we have to do is show up." 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi broke a 6-6 tie in the sixth inning on a run-scoring single by Tony 
Gonzalez, and Gus Jordt gave the Celts an insurance run they would need by 
scoring on an error. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles fell short after scoring in the top of the seventh when Gabe 
Crecion drove in his brother, Adam Crecion, with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Ron Jones (9-3) earned the victory for the Celts and senior Casey Cote 
(1-2) took the loss for Chaminade.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ron had plenty of reason to be frustrated, but he really hung in there," 
Crespi Coach Scott Muckey said. "He did a great job for us today." 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams scored a run in the first inning before Crespi (16-9, 8-6 in league 
play) took a 2-1 lead in the second. Chaminade (16-9, 8-6) grabbed a 4-2 lead 
with three runs in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celts responded with three runs in the bottom of the fourth. Barry Mathews 
scored from third base on a wild pitch, Chris Crawley scored from third on an 
error and John Campanella made it home on a fielder's choice to give Crespi a 
5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Farlow drove in the Celts' sixth run with a triple to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade scored two runs in the sixth to tie the score, 6-6, before Crespi 
took the lead for good in the bottom of the inning.

BUSINESS LEADERS URGED TO GIVE GATT SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES H. RUBIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration asked an elite group of business leaders Friday for 
help in winning congressional passage of a global trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider what the pact "will do for your bottom line," Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen told 96 of the nation's foremost executives.The group is having 
its twice-yearly meeting in this colonial resort community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's incumbent on those who will benefit to speak up and make it 
clear" they support passage of the world trade agreement negotiated by more 
than 100 countries last December in Geneva, Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has run into trouble on 
Capitol Hill because of the need for tax increases and spending cuts to make up 
for an estimated $14 billion in lost tariff revenue over the first five years 
of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great deal at stake here," Bentsen told the Business Council. 
"Think about what you stand to gain and what you stand to lose. The GATT deal 
opens markets for the products in which the United States is the most 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen also did some crowing about the domestic economy on a day when the 
government announced reassuring inflation figures. Consumer prices edged down 
0.1% in April, helping to push the country's underlying inflation rate for the 
past 12 months to its lowest level in 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In noting an earlier report that unemployment is down to 6.4%, Bentsen said: 
"Of course, as soon as we see growth, we begin to worry about inflation. But 
I'll take success over the doldrums any day." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said he saw little cause to worry about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're encouraged by what we see in the numbers," he said.

BROKERAGE PARTNER POLITICALLY CONNECTED; PROFILE: WILLIAM E. COOPER GAVE TO 
CAMPAIGNS, BOUGHT JOHN SEYMOUR FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When William E. Cooper, a politically well-connected real estate investor, 
bought politician John Seymour's real estate brokerage in 1981, he said he 
hoped to emulate the giants of Wall Street finance. 
</P>
<P>
 This may not be what he had in mind. Federal investigators revealed Friday 
that First Pension Corp., Cooper's Orange County pension management firm, may 
have lost or misappropriated as much as $124 million in client funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, 50, who lives in this northern Orange County town, is known among 
Southland political figures as a staunch Republican and frequent contributor to 
state and local campaigns; he was once a member of a prominent local 
fund-raising club. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very easygoing guy, very much into the outdoors, who liked to give 
lavish gifts," a onetime Cooper friend said. "He was always surrounded by 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour, who went on to serve as a U.S. senator, counted Cooper among his 
supporters until Cooper began failing to make payments on the purchase of 
Seymour's brokerage business. Now chairman of the California Housing Finance 
Agency, Seymour said the sale to Cooper cost him "considerable sums" and that 
he has not spoken with Cooper since. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County official said Cooper would "end up sitting in the back row at 
a political event but enjoyed being part of the crowd. He liked being on a 
first-name basis with politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, Cooper and his partner in First Pension, Robert Lindley, were 
financial backers of a proposal to bring a 200-table card club to Anaheim that 
would have been the Southland's largest. City Council members, several of whom 
received campaign donations from Cooper, rejected the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate was the basis of Cooper's fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 He started in the mortgage business in 1961, when he was 18, as a loan officer 
trainee. He later worked for Union Home Loan as a loan officer and branch 
manager, then moved to Capital Home Loan, rising to become general manager 
before he left in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, Cooper formed Continental Home Loan, a loan brokerage firm, 
which became a wholly owned subsidiary of another of Cooper's companies, First 
Diversified Financial Services. It was then that Cooper bought Seymour Realty 
Register from the then-mayor of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Cooper ran into trouble after $577,850 was diverted from a trust 
fund, L.B. Mortgage Servicing Co., according to the California Department of 
Real Estate. Cooper's real estate license was revoked for negligence and 
failing to supervise the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's next run-in with authorities came with First Pension.

OFF THE TICKER: GOOFY BANK ROBBER STORY NO. 4,781 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to disprove the adage that crime doesn't pay, a man who tried to rob a 
Charlotte bank has sued the bank for $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Amil Dinsio, 58, who, along with relatives, tried to hack a hole in the roof 
of United Carolina Bank two years ago, sued the bank in federal court here. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinsio claims his 46-month prison sentence is too long because the bank 
exaggerated the amount it could have lost ($272,000) had the robbery been 
successful -- which it was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinsio, now in a federal prison in Loretto, Pa., says the $15 million in his 
suit was "just a figure." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what you do in lawsuits," he said. "I'd be happy with a couple of 
million."

SEC SAYS FIRST PENSION CORP. RAN PYRAMID SCAM; INVESTIGATION: IRVINE-BASED FIRM 
MISLED CLIENTS INTO INVESTING IN MORTGAGES THAT DID NOT EXIST, THE AGENCY 
ALLEGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The owners of Irvine-based First Pension Corp. operated an elaborate pyramid 
scheme that misled clients into thinking they were investing in mortgages that 
in fact did not exist, federal authorities disclosed Friday in alleging that as 
much as $124 million may have been lost to fraud and outright theft. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegation in federal court by the Securities and Exchange Commission is 
the most complete version so far of how the scheme may have worked.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency said as much as $99 million of clients' funds may not have been 
invested in real estate loans at all, despite the investment promoters' 
promises. That means the possibility of recovery may be much lower for many 
customers than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations were made by the SEC against prominent Orange County 
businessman William E. Cooper and two of his long-term associates, Valerie 
Jensen and Robert E. Lindley. The three have been partners in a raft of 
brokerages and real estate deals over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC asked for and received from U.S. District Judge Manuel Real an order 
freezing the assets of Cooper, Lindley, Jensen and five firms they established 
or operated. These include First Pension Corp., its parent First Diversified 
Financial Services, Vestcorp Securities Inc. and Ernest-Edwards & Associates. 
The agency also moved to freeze 31 bank accounts held by the trio and their 
affiliated firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Over and above the $99 million at risk in the real estate partnerships, the 
SEC charged that an additional $25 million may have been lost through outright 
theft of clients' checks, forgery of corporate checks and the establishment of 
fraudulent bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 In April alone, according to court papers filed by the SEC, Cooper forged 114 
checks totaling $1.3 million on a custodial account held at Denver-based Summit 
Trust Services, a firm he and his partners had established to handle their 
clients' money.  
</P>
<P>
 Cooper also arranged in late March or early April -- a period when income tax 
deadlines meant that clients' contributions to their First Pension accounts 
would have been at a yearly peak -- to give himself personal access to First 
Pension's incoming mail, court papers say. 
</P>
<P>
 In that period, an unknown number of clients' incoming checks disappeared, 
many of which were eventually deposited in illicit bank accounts opened by 
Cooper and Lindley, the SEC alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension declared bankruptcy April 22, one day after Colorado state 
authorities seized Summit Trust on a complaint by its president that millions 
in client funds could not be accounted for.  
</P>
<P>
 First Pension had an estimated 8,000 clients whose accounts totaled about $350 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension functioned as a pension fund administrator, serving people who 
wished to make individual choices about where to invest their individual 
retirement accounts, Keogh accounts or other retirement funds. In practice, 
many of its customers were persuaded to put their money into real estate 
limited partnerships marketed by First Diversified and Vestcorp. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Ernest-Edwards, the name of which comes from Cooper's and Lindley's 
middle names, the SEC charged that it was established as a subterfuge to allow 
the three principals to siphon First Pension clients' cash out of custodial 
bank accounts held by Summit Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's criminal attorney, Robert Bonner, could not be reached Friday. 
Jensen's lawyer, Donald Smaltz, said he would not comment on the allegations 
until he had seen the SEC's court filing.  
</P>
<P>
 Lindley's attorney, Russell Hayman, said: "The SEC is aware that Mr. Lindley 
is cooperating with the FBI and the U.S. attorney, and part of that involves 
cooperation with the SEC."  
</P>
<P>
 He added that he was not surprised at the agency's motion to freeze the 
principals' assets, but he would not comment further.  
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's and Jensen's lawyers have both said previously that their clients 
were cooperating with federal authorities investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the SEC said Friday that Jensen and Lindley both pleaded the Fifth 
Amendment when asked about their personal finances; Cooper refused to appear 
before the agency at all. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the SEC's case are 218 limited partnerships that Vestcorp 
established and sold to First Pension clients beginning in 1981, raising at 
least $99 million. The firm said the partnerships would invest in second or 
junior trust deeds, or mortgages, and that they would return dividends of as 
much as 28% annually from the borrowers' repayments on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC alleges that, for the most part, the money was not invested in real 
estate at all. According to testimony by Ana Maritza Golan, First Pension's 
operations manager, on Jensen's instruction she set up a secret account known 
as the "99 minifund" from which investors in the real estate partnerships 
received what purportedly was income distributions from mortgages.  
</P>
<P>
 But the agency says no such income came in and that the investors were 
actually getting money other clients had sent to First Pension for their own 
accounts. As much as $2.1 million passed through the 99 minifund between 1988 
and October, 1993, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership investors were largely unable to get any information on the 
nature of these mortgages, including details on the location of the underlying 
property or the credit-worthiness of the borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The dearth of information afflicted Vestcorp's own officers. SEC documents say 
that in 1991, Rodger Rusch, then president of Vestcorp, had tried and failed to 
find official records that trust deeds had been transferred to the limited 
partnerships his firm had marketed.  
</P>
<P>
 Confronted by Rusch, Cooper told him he had decided to hold the trust deeds in 
his own name or those of firms he controlled, rather than paying the $10 fee 
and going through the trouble of recording the transfers to the partnerships, 
the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, that didn't make any sense," said Lisa A. Gok, the SEC's assistant 
regional director for enforcement.

U.S. CAR SALES POP A WHEELIE; DEALERS HAVING A HARD TIME MEETING DEMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL and LINUS CHUA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
 Dee Ferkula couldn't believe it. For years, she had heard how car dealers were 
hurting. Almost desperate to make a deal. But it wasn't a buyer's market that 
Ferkula found when she walked into her local Jeep dealer's showroom seven weeks 
ago to buy a new Cherokee. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of falling all over himself to put her -- "Right now! Today!' ' -- 
into one of several dozen models on the lot, the salesman told her she would 
have to wait to get the one she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular sport utility vehicle is one of about half a dozen models in hot 
demand this spring, forcing some dealers to do something they haven't done much 
of in years: write up so-called retail orders for factory production of cars 
for customers who want particular color or equipment combinations that just 
can't be found in area showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these spot shortages involve domestic brands, which have gained in 
popularity in the past year. New models from Detroit have hit showrooms 
accompanied by news reports of increasing quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like a Honda dealer," Huntington Beach Jeep-Eagle co-owner Rick Evans 
quipped, referring to the popularity and sales pace of the big Japanese auto 
maker's products in the United States during the mid-1980s. "We're not used to 
this. But I guess if you hang on long enough, your time will come." 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest models include top-of-the-line Ford Explorers, Mustangs with 
Ford's super-premium sound system, any Chevrolet Suburban or full-size K-5 
Blazer, six-speed Camaro convertibles and Jeep Cherokees and Grand Cherokees. 
</P>
<P>
 Perri Selman, spokeswoman for Selman Chevrolet in Orange, said the dealership 
delivers 15 to 20 Suburbans a month and most are sold in advance -- ordered by 
customers who are willing to wait up to 12 weeks to get the color and equipment 
combination they want. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a batch in last month and only six weren't pre-sold," she said. "But 
all six of them were gone within two days. I've only got one out on the lot 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The new popularity of domestic brands has also been exacerbated by the fact 
that auto makers closed plants and reduced production when American brands were 
less popular, said Frank McClure, general manager of Center Jeep Eagle in Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers "are working on improvement," McClure said. "But they just didn't 
have the capacity for building when the pent-up demand broke loose." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the shortage in California is that Chevrolet -- like several 
other domestic and foreign car makers -- supplies dealers on a so-called 
turn-and-earn basis: Cars are allotted based on the dealership's recent sales 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Because California's economy has suffered for four years, many dealers in the 
state are losing allotments to dealerships in the Midwest and East, where 
economic recovery began more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Gray, owner of Orange Coast Jeep-Eagle in Costa Mesa -- where Ferkula 
bought her car -- said the distance from California to Detroit also contributes 
to shortages: It takes 15 days for Gray to receive a shipment of cars once he 
"earns" them by selling out a previous shipment. A Jeep dealer in Detroit or 
Kansas City, in contrast, can turn around a shipment in three or four days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it when they told me how long it would be," said Ferkula, 
a senior loan officer with a community bank in Orange. She'll get her V-6 Grand 
Cherokee with factory-tinted windows and an overhead console nine weeks after 
she first walked onto the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford buyers are in better shape because Ford Motor Co. began recovering before 
its competitors from Detroit's doldrums and has cranked up production of its 
most popular models in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the factory still consistently fails to meet Southern California dealers' 
needs for certain Explorer and Mustang models, said Theodore Robins Jr., 
president of Theodore Robins Ford in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I can even get (a Ford Explorer), to be honest," said Jay 
Rosen, sales manager at Santa Monica Ford in Santa Monica. "And if I could, it 
would be at least eight weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 At General Motors Corp.'s resurgent Buick division, dealers are reporting spot 
shortages of several models. 
</P>
<P>
 Buick shut down several plants for four months last year to provide extra 
production space for Chevrolet's redesigned Lumina. Now Buick dealers have a 
hard time finding Park Avenues and Regals, said Don Partch, manager of Nabers 
Cadillac-Buick in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 And Irvine-based Mazda Motor of America thought its dealers would sell only 
800 of the company's new Japanese-built Millenia luxury car in March, the first 
month it was offered. Instead, Mazda dealers moved 1,900 of the $25,000 to 
$35,000 sedans in March and 800 in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the early 1990s, when Southern California showrooms were overflowing 
with unsold cars, dealers who run out of one of today's hot models can't even 
help customers by trading with a fellow dealer who has one. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody wants a Suburban and we don't have one, chances are nobody else 
will, either," Selman said. Hot Cars 
</P>
<P>
 Some automobile models have vastly increased in popularity this year -- with 
sales to date significantly outpacing the 1993 rate -- forcing some customers 
to wait for the car they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales, in thousands: Jeep Cherokee 1994 first quarter: 39.97 1993 total sales: 
125.44 Ford Explorer 1994 first quarter: 100.99 1993 total sales: 302.20 Jeep 
Grand Cherokee 1994 first quarter: 80.90 1993 total sales: 217.23 Chevy Blazer 
1994 first quarter: 7.55 1993 total sales: 22.85 Chevy Suburban 1994 first 
quarter: 27.75 1993 total sales: 82.62 Ford Mustang 1994 first quarter: 61.98 
1993 total sales: 98.65 Chevy Camaro 1994 first quarter: 42.35 1993 total

DERIVATIVES ARE BLAMED IN ARCO FUND'S $22-MILLION LOSS; SECURITIES: THE 
VOLATILE INVESTMENTS WERE MADE THROUGH AN OSTENSIBLY LOW-RISK MONEY MARKET 
FUND. THE COMPANY SEEKS IRS APPROVAL TO REIMBURSE INVESTORS, SAYS IT HAS 
CHANGED STRATEGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Officials of Atlantic Richfield Co. confirmed Friday that it was investments 
in volatile derivative securities by an ostensibly low-risk employee savings 
plan that resulted in a $22-million loss last month when interest rates soared 
unexpectedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees -- some of whom saw the value of their savings accounts fall by 
thousands of dollars as the plan lost 5.3% of its worth -- expressed varying 
degrees of shock and disappointment with the performance of the Arco-managed 
Money Market Plus Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that it was a money market account and therefore that the potential 
risk of losing principal was nil, so I was surprised when it lost money," said 
Stephen Oettinger, director of community and public relations for Arco's 
transportation company in Long Beach. He said his holdings in the fund amounted 
to tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco said it has liquidated all of the derivative securities in question and 
changed the investment strategy of the money market fund to avoid such 
investments in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to employees last week, Arco said it wanted to make good on the 
losses of affected employees. "Whether or not we can do that depends on whether 
we get the appropriate approvals from the Internal Revenue Service," Arco 
spokesman Al Greenstein said Friday, citing potential tax questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure that the fund invested in derivatives came a day after The 
Times reported that the Money Market Plus Fund, one of several options 
employees may choose for investment of tax-deferred or retirement savings, had 
experienced the dramatic April loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the losses were associated with derivative securities with principal 
risks," Greenstein said Friday. He declined to specify the types of securities, 
saying only that they were not mortgage-backed securities, which lately have 
not performed as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenstein would not say whether Arco will make any personnel changes at Arco 
Investment Management Co., whose president is Beverly Hamilton. Hamilton did 
not return phone calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Arco's investment strategy comes as regulators and policy-makers are 
focusing attention on the growing market for derivatives -- often-complex 
transactions involving the trading of options, futures or combinations of the 
two that are designed to hedge risks in the movement of interest rates, 
commodity prices or other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Several major companies in recent weeks have announced losses of millions of 
dollars from derivatives transactions.  
</P>
<P>
 However, a spokesman for the Investment Company Institute in Washington, a 
mutual fund industry trade group, said he was unaware of any money-market-type 
funds that have had trouble because of investments in derivative securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, money market funds invest in commercial paper, government 
securities, certificates of deposit and other usually liquid and relatively 
safe securities. Most are managed to maintain a $1-per-share principal value. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, "derivative securities as a concept aren't necessarily risky, but 
a lot are structured so that they are quite exposed to the market and can be 
quite volatile," said Catherine Voss Sanders, an analyst with Morningstar 
Mutual Funds in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, she said, derivatives are the kinds of investments money market 
funds should avoid: "Money markets are just perceived by people . . . as 
rock-solid instruments. Nobody thinks the principal is even capable of" a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Arco's own documents describe its Money Market Plus Fund as an 
investment vehicle designed to "provide security of principal and liquidity," 
as well as to earn rates higher than typical short-term Treasury bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, plan documents do not prohibit fund managers from investing in 
derivatives, and fund participants are made aware of the inherent risks of any 
investments, Greenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Employee savings funds such as those operated by Arco are regulated by the 
Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration of the U.S. Labor Department. Area 
director David Ganz said the agency generally takes enforcement action when a 
fund manager makes imprudent or impermissible investments or ones that involve 
a conflict of interest.  
</P>
<P>
 He declined to say whether Arco is the subject of an inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, phone calls poured into the office of Arco's fund management 
company. While the promise of being made whole mollified some employees, others 
still found the loss disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why it happened," said one Arco executive who asked not to 
be named. With $150,000 invested in the Money Market Plus Fund, his loss in 
April would have added up to $7,950. "It certainly suggests a problem that 
needs to addressed," he said.

PRICES UP JUST 0.1% IN APRIL, BUT FED HIKE STILL EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said Friday that consumer prices rose 0.1% last month, 
a paltry increase that may ease pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to 
dramatically raise interest rates in its effort to keep a lid on inflation and 
prevent the economy from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the report was the latest indicator that inflation remains in check 
despite the nation's current economic expansion, it is not expected to dissuade 
the Fed from raising rates again -- perhaps as early as next week -- in its 
effort to keep inflationary pressures from building. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts said Friday's report, combined with other recent signs that 
inflation is under control, could encourage the central bank to raise rates 
only slightly instead of initiating a larger increase that could possibly slam 
the brakes on the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people have been saying that the Fed is going to raise rates by a 
half-point soon, but the data that has been released over the last few days 
indicates that it doesn't need to raise rates at all," said Fred Flick, an 
economist for the National Assn. of Realtors in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report, the Commerce Department said business inventories dipped 
0.2% in March from February levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the modest decline was also good news for holding down prices 
because it indicates there is little danger of product shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has hiked the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point 
three times over the past three months, and most analysts expect it to raise 
rates again by the time the board's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee 
meets Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 By raising short-term rates, the Fed discourages businesses and consumers from 
borrowing more money, which in turn tends to slow down the economy and dampen 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday's report that the prices consumers pay for a variety of goods and 
services -- from food and shelter to gas and medical care -- rose just 0.1% in 
April from March was the latest indication that inflation is not yet eating 
away at Americans' buying power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inflation is just nowhere to be seen," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at 
financial services company Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department's report said consumers paid more for their food and 
medical attention last month but less for their utilities and clothes. Housing 
expenses were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the department reported that wholesale prices -- which measure 
inflation at the manufacturers' level, before goods reach consumers -- fell 
0.1% in April. 
</P>
<P>
 But while some analysts said the two reports show that the economy is slowing 
by itself and doesn't need any help from the Fed, others said inflationary 
pressures are quietly building and that the central bank will need to boost 
rates by at least half a percentage point to keep inflation from skyrocketing 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oil prices have jumped over the past few weeks, steel and auto prices are 
rising, and inflation seems to be waiting for a place to jump in and take 
hold," said Cynthia Latta, senior financial economist at DRI/McGraw Hill in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Fed should raise rates the full (half-point) next week, and 
that's just what it's going to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A stiff increase in the federal funds rate would also send a strong message to 
investors on Wall Street and around the world that America is serious about 
keeping inflation in check, which could calm the roiling U.S. stock and bond 
markets and restore some of the dollar's strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed might figure that it's better to make one big increase in short-term 
rates and then sit back to see how it plays out, rather than raising rates in 
tiny increments and hoping for the best," said Paul Kasriel, an economist at 
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report issued Friday, the University of Michigan said its 
preliminary consumer confidence index has fallen slightly, to 91.5 this month 
from 92.6 in April, as rising rates made consumers more pessimistic about the 
future of the economy. Consumer Price Index

BUILDING TAIWAN: ASIA GOLD RUSH ON; INDUSTRY: FOREIGN COMPANIES CLAMOR TO GET 
PARTS OF ITS SIX-YEAR, $300-BILLION INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's a burning issue in Taiwan, pitting the United States and Europe against 
Japan in a global competition that speaks volumes about business in the 
high-stakes political minefields of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The question: Who will have the privilege of burning garbage in this cash-rich 
island state? 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese got off to a head start three years ago, claiming they were 
uniquely qualified for the job because they share with Taiwan a basic garbage 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian garbage is "wet" compared to Western trash, the argument went, and that 
supposedly made Japan's incinerator technology the kind best suited to the 
task. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, said Americans trying to wrest away a few good public-works 
contracts from the Japanese, who so far have dominated Taiwan's growing market 
for municipal incinerators. Garbage viscosity is a lame excuse, they said, for 
keeping a chokehold on the lucrative contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is far more than the $1 billion worth of waste incinerator contracts 
Taiwan will award this year alone. Foreign contractors are also competing here 
for power plants, telecommunications gear and mass-transit projects -- all 
parts of Taiwan's $300-billion, six-year plan to develop a modern 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 The total budget has been scaled back somewhat since this ambitious building 
bonanza was announced, with considerable hoopla, in 1991. And, since a series 
of snafus involving land speculation and corruption, it appears that very 
little work will have been completed by year six of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taipei is still Fat City in an Asian infrastructure gold rush that extends 
from Hong Kong to Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 After about a third of the infrastructure budget goes to land acquisition and 
another third is paid to local contractors, Taiwan's market will yield some $60 
billion to $80 billion in contracts to international bidders, according to U.S. 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen estimates that Asian countries will 
spend $1 trillion on infrastructure in the next decade. That figure doesn't 
count Japan's market, until recently closed to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's 18 Santa Monica Freeway projects every day," Bentsen said in Los 
Angeles last month. "If I were 30 years younger, I know what market I'd want to 
be in." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not all easy money. Taiwan's trash scene, for one, illustrates the 
convoluted reality of doing business in the trenches of Asia's public-works 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "This incinerator thing has been one big frustration," said Gregory Stevens, 
an American environmental business consultant based in Taipei. "It's a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 On the face of things, Taiwan's central government couldn't be more 
accommodating to European and U.S. firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Taipei's dusty streets are torn up now for a sprawling light-rail project that 
has been parceled off in so many segments to so many foreign joint ventures 
that local wags call it "the United Nations subway system." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynical observers say the government, bucking its diplomatic pariah status as 
pretender to China's throne, is trying to buy some respect on the international 
stage with its public-works program. Others allege that civilian contracts in 
some cases have been used as bait for foreign arms deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, one of Taipei's most audacious strategies is its official policy of 
discrimination against Japan in awarding the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Taipei, distressed by a $15-billion bilateral trade deficit with Japan, has 
retaliated by raising import barriers and nominally banning Japanese companies 
from bidding for public-works projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the official ban hasn't stopped Japanese-controlled firms from grabbing 
a piece of the pie. They've bidden through overseas subsidiaries or local joint 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 On a section of the Taipei subway where Boise, Ida.-based Morrison Knudsen has 
a contract, price-competitive Komatsu backhoes are ripping up the asphalt. The 
roads are clogged with supposedly verboten Japanese autos -- assembled in local 
screwdriver plants or imported from the United States to circumvent high 
tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Fords popular in this former Japanese colony are made by Mazda, 
lamented Ying Price, chief of the commercial section for the American Institute 
in Taiwan, the unofficial embassy. "Taiwan was occupied by Japan for 50 years," 
she said. "Maybe the troops left, but Japan's business practices are still 
deeply rooted." 
</P>
<P>
 In the world of incinerators, as in other sectors, the Japanese competitive 
grip begins with the "specs," or engineering specifications. Typically, whoever 
drafts the specs for an international tender has a decisive advantage in the 
competitive bidding. It's smart business. And in Taiwan, Japanese consultants 
initially set the specs for Taiwan's incinerators -- thereby perpetrating that 
myth that their technology was "designed to treat Asian garbage," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers say the Japanese construction industry's time-honored practice 
of dango , or bid rigging, has traveled to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese contractors behave as collusive bidders," said Chi Schive, vice 
chairman of the government's Economic Planning and Development Council. "They 
join as a group to bid, and they try to monopolize the market here." 
</P>
<P>
 When a European or U.S. company bids on a project, Schive said, the Japanese 
firms typically "lower their bids so no one can make a profit. In the second 
round, there are no Europeans or Americans left, and they raise their bids." 
</P>
<P>
 Schive didn't say which bidding he was talking about, but other observers say 
that's exactly what happened in the first round of eight incinerators put to 
bid in 1991. Six of those projects went to Japanese-affiliated companies. 
Japanese industry sources deny wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two went to Volund, a Danish firm, and its local partner, Chung 
Hsin. The Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwan's ruling party, is a major shareholder in 
Chung Hsin, industry sources say. (The KMT controls an extensive network of 
companies in Taiwan, but it flatly dismissed criticism that its involvement in 
business poses any conflict of interest.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Taiwanese authorities, in their zeal to stack the deck against the 
Japanese, decided to retain U.S. consultants to guide local officials in 
setting incinerator specifications in the second and future rounds of bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 And Taiwan's Environmental Protection Agency, which funds the municipal 
projects, now requires that foreign companies involved in the bidding own their 
original technology. 
</P>
<P>
 That rule burned all but one Japanese player, Takuma Co. of Osaka, which won 
two incinerator contracts in 1991. The others were licensing European 
technology, notwithstanding their claims of special expertise in Asian trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule change strengthened the hand of the Europeans, who excel at burning 
trash. It also eliminated all but three American companies: WMX Technologies, 
the former Waste Management Inc., of Oakbrook, Ill.; Pittsburgh-based 
Westinghouse Electric, and Foster Wheeler of Clinton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very tough market, but we think we can compete," said Katsihiko Senga, 
general manager of Takuma's overseas department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were accused of collusion by the newspapers because of a misunderstanding 
about budget overruns," Senga said. "But it's not true. The whole atmosphere of 
discrimination is unfair to Japanese vendors. It's all because of the trade 
balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet bidding on the second round, for six incinerators, was delayed until early 
this year. Taiwanese companies lobbied to join the fray as prime contractors, 
reversing roles in their alliances with the international firms by using 
foreign technology partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the political situation here, your technical qualifications aren't 
as important as your political clout," said a representative of a foreign 
environmental company in Taipei. "In the first round, you had Japanese 
collusion, but now there's political collusion." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the Chung Hsin-Vorlund partnership was awarded two more 
incinerators, leaving four up for grabs this fiscal year, which ends in June. 
</P>
<P>
 As if things weren't confusing enough, overlapping layers of bureaucracy in 
Taiwan add another challenge to the sport of infrastructure bidding here. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the central government claims to rule all of China, a redundant 
provincial government supposedly runs this small, congested island. Add to that 
county and municipal councils, all with a say in infrastructure policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to be singled out for a decision of any sort in this politically 
charged environment," complained a Taiwan-based American executive in the power 
generation industry. "And we have nothing that the politicians are interested 
in. We don't vote, and we don't do political campaign contributions." 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is ripe for corruption, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, many of whom were 
jailed as dissidents in the old days, have appointed themselves guardians 
against boondoggles and graft. 
</P>
<P>
 Maysing H. Yang, a DPP official, railed in an interview about the problems of 
the disjointed "United Nations subway," on which equipment has failed and trash 
cans cost $1,000 each. The cost of building the line, she said, is 40 times 
higher than subway construction in Tokyo or Singapore, because insider 
speculation has driven up land prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that Japan has a lot of corruption," Yang said, "but at least their 
projects work." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, a Taipei court convicted 13 city transit officials on corruption 
charges and ordered them to repay $9.7 million in misappropriated funds. The 
$17-billion commuter rail program has been plagued by litigation, including a 
bizarre contract dispute with the French firm Matra. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Y. Chen, executive secretary of the Public Construction Supervisory 
Board, the government's official watchdog agency, blames democracy for the 
infrastructure morass. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that regional officials and local councils have been empowered by 
democratic reform, Chen said, they all want a piece of the action. That has 
slowed approvals for permits and helped inflate land costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this problem with land is the kind of trouble you get from democracy," he 
said. "We accomplished so much in the past, but now, with too much democracy, 
everybody can say something, and it's impossible to move."

 Firm Seeks to Compete With Pacific Bell, GTE: Teleport Communications Group 
asked the California Public Utilities Commission to allow it to compete against 
the companies in the local telephone market.The two big phone utilities hold 
monopolies on such service throughout most of California. Current law prohibits 
competition, but state regulators have indicated they intend to open 
telecommunications services to all comers, including cable companies. Teleport, 
based in Staten Island, N.Y., wants to offer local phone service to companies

 Striking Workers Picket Zacky Headquarters: Employees from Zacky Farms' 
Commerce processing plant picketed the poultry company's El Monte headquarters 
to highlight their demands for safer working conditions and pay equality with 
other Zacky sites. About 120 members of the United Food and Commercial Workers 
Union Local 770 went on strike May 5 after nine months without a contract.The 
next day, Zacky told them they would be permanently replaced if they did not 
return to work by Monday. However, instead of replacing the strikers, Zacky 
staffed the plant with managers and temporary workers and opened negotiations 
with the UFCW through federal mediators. Unless it receives a satisfactory 
offer from Zacky, the UFCW said, it will expand the strike to the El Monte 
distribution center, which could interrupt chicken shipments to supermarkets.

INVESTORS 'DIDN'T HAVE SLIGHTEST INKLING' OF TROUBLE AT FIRM 
</P>

 First Pension Corp. investors expressed shock Friday on learning that their 
retirement funds were frozen at best and very likely lost to fraud and theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired aerospace engineer Irvin Starr, 64, started worrying two weeks ago 
when he was unable to reach First Pension affiliate Vestcorp by telephone from 
his home in Hercules, north of Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 When he called, Starr said, a tape-recorded message told him to punch in a 
password. "That was a bad sign, because they'd never demanded a password 
before," said Starr, who invested $80,000 through Vestcorp. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the Securities and Exchange Commission's allegations that First 
Pension was operating as a pyramid scheme shocked him: "I'm an experienced 
investor, and I didn't have the slightest inkling that something was wrong."  
</P>
<P>
 Neither did Jose Hernandez, who invested more than $100,000 with the company. 
He saw the first sign of trouble two weeks ago, when First Pension declared 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, 70, was preparing for a back-yard barbecue at his home in La Palma 
when word of the SEC allegations broke Friday. "These people, I don't know 
where the nerve comes from," he said. "I hope the law will take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
 While many said money they placed with First Pension didn't represent their 
life savings, others, including Glendale resident John Keeler, say they may 
have lost everything. 
</P>
<P>
 About three years ago, the 67-year-old former insurance company inspector put 
his savings into four different First Pension investment pools. In January, he 
received his most recent dividend check and was told that the value of the 
accounts was $5,750. 
</P>
<P>
 His only other retirement income, Keller said, is $1,000 a month from Social 
Security. "I jumped around between jobs so much that I never had a chance to 
build up any equity" in a retirement fund, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Dean Takahashi, Chris Woodyard and Greg Johnson in Orange 
County contributed to this report.

BOND YIELDS DECLINE; STOCKS UP MODESTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bond yields fell and stocks rose modestly Friday as news of mild inflation for 
the second straight day relieved market worries that the economy is growing too 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Federal Reserve Board is still expected to raise interest rates next 
week, and this gave the dollar a boost against major foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The market, which has been obsessed with inflation, cheered when the 
government reported a meager 0.1% rise in April consumer prices, below the 0.3% 
expected. That followed news Thursday of an unexpected 0.1% drop in April 
producer prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But waves of bond selling eroded an early-day surge in prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bear market psychology to sell is very much evident in reactions to the 
data today. It's very much a tug of war," said Dana Johnson, head of market 
analysis at First Chicago Capital Markets in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, the yield on the Treasury's bellwether long bond fell to 7.49% 
from 7.55% on Thursday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, was 
up 19/32 point, or $5.94 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts still expect the inflation-wary Fed to raise short-term interest 
rates at its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story is future inflation. The data might have a modest impact on 
deliberations, but the Fed is more worried about capacity use, employment and 
the GDP gap," said Cary Leahey, senior economist at Lehman Government 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average finished up 6.84 points at 
3,659.68, but it posted a loss of 9.82 for the week. In the broader market, 
declining issues narrowly exceeded gainers on moderate volume of 252.08 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite fell 2.69 points to 716.92. 
</P>
<P>
 The market was hit by a slump in computer networking company shares sparked by 
Wall Street disappointment over Cisco Systems' quarterly results released 
Thursday. Cisco fell 5 3/32 to 23 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 But many investors chose to hold their bets until the interest rate picture 
cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Other computer networking stocks were hammered after Cisco's results were 
announced. Wellfleet Communications dropped 8 to 63 1/2, Cabletron Systems sank 
2 1/2 to 93 1/2, 3Com shed 1 5/8 to 55 and Compaq lost 1 to 104 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft was among the few strong performers in technology, rising 2 to 96 
1/2 on news it will replace Syntex Corp. in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. 
</P>
<P>
 * EMC fell 1 1/4 to 15 5/8. Analysts were reportedly disappointed when the 
company indicated that production of its new mainframe disk storage systems 
will be slower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Morris gained 1 5/8 to 52 1/8, adding to Thursday's 3-point rise on 
speculation that the company's May 25 board meeting will bring a spinoff of its 
tobacco unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Countrywide Credit, which is said to be an attractive takeover target, rose 
2 1/4 to 16 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Southwest Airlines fell 1 7/8 to 25 3/8 and AMR, parent of American 
Airlines, fell 2 3/8 to 53 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were mixed in overseas markets. In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX-30 average 
ended the week at 2,258.75, up 15.12 points, while London's Financial Times 
100-share average fell 18.6 points to 3,119.2. 
</P>
<P>
 In Asia, Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei closed up 46.51 points at 20,270.75 and Hong 
Kong's Hang Seng index jumped 255.86 points to finish the week at 9,134.72. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index rose 4.47 points, or 0.2%, to close at 2,240.17. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar advanced against most major currencies, rising with the 
bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar rose to 1.670 German marks and 105.05 Japanese yen in late New York 
trading, from 1.667 marks and 104.30 yen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Gallopo, chief currency trader at Chemical Bank, said: "We traded off 
the bond market today. Every currency trader has his bond page up, and when 
bonds get hit, so does the dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are looking for clues in the bond and equity markets. For every move 
in those markets, people are buying and selling dollar-denominated assets. The 
markets are very closely linked." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, gold settled at $380.70 an ounce, up 80 cents on the New York 
Comex, while silver fetched $5.40, up 4 cents.

 Banc One Buys 58 Great American Branches: Banc One Corp. purchased the Arizona 
branches of San Diego-based Great American Bank, which was seized by federal 
regulators in 1991.Banc One, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, said it will 
assume insured deposits totaling about $1.4 billion in the transaction. The 
Great American branches will reopen Monday as Banc One offices. Banc One 
entered the Arizona market last year with the purchase of Valley National bank, 
which has $11.4 billion in assets and the largest market share in the state. In 
a separate sale, Sterling Financial Corp. of Spokane, Wash., said it purchased 
five Great American branches in that state with deposits of $135 million.

 West Coast Bancorp, a Newport Beach bank holding company, reported a 
first-quarter loss of $1.4 million, or 15 cents a share, contrasted with a net 
loss of $1.4 million, or 16 cents a share, for the like period in 1993. The 
company said the quarterly loss resulted primarily from losses associated with 
non-performing assets. Total assets as of March 31 fell 18% from the 
year-earlier period, to $284.7 million from $347.3 million.

O.C RECORD REVIEW; IN JANN BROWNE COUNTRY, MUSIC SPEAKS THE TRUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 **** Jann Browne 
</P>
<P>
 "Count Me In" 
</P>
<P>
 Red Moon (Swiss import) 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of today's mainstream country music makes me want to talk back to my 
stereo. Slick, sound-alike performances, bad puns posing as songs, phony, 
simplistic or rose-tinted treatments of such inherently knotty subjects as 
romantic strife, the working life and family ties -- it's enough to make you 
mutter things like "So you think Hank done it that way?" and "Life's just not 
like that, buddy." 
</P>
<P>
 Jann Browne's superb new album is mutter-proof. Its indelible, supremely 
rewarding melodies make it hard not to hum along. Its determination to explore 
the hurting, even tragic, side of life without flinching leads to moments when 
you may have to choke back an honestly earned tear. Its overall impact may take 
your breath away. No, music that leaves you singing along, checking a sob or 
catching your breath does not need a talking-to. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem with "Count Me In" is that Browne's timing is way off: Had it 
come along 20 years ago, an album this strong would have established her 
alongside the Eagles, Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt and that other J. Browne 
as one of the stars in Southern California's country-rock firmament. But given 
the sad condition of country radio today, she already is counting herself out 
of the mainstream market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't wanna play the big label game. Have no desire," she said between sets 
of her record-release celebration last weekend at the Rio Grande Bar and Grill 
in San Juan Capistrano. "If a smaller label wants to pick it up, I'd be really 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 A leading figure on the Orange County country scene since she moved here from 
her native Indiana in 1978, Browne already has had a serious fling with the 
Nashville mainstream -- a courtship, judging from the clipped, telegraphic 
certitude of her comments, that she does not care to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Her albums for Curb records, "Tell Me Why" (1990) and "It Only Hurts When I 
Laugh" (1991), showed her command of traditional country styles and made a 
credible bid for radio acceptance without sacrificing her integrity. But by 
late 1992, her record deal was over, and she had decided to cast her lot with 
country's progressive wing. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of relying upon outside writers, as she did for the bulk of her first 
two albums, she would come up with her own material and try to follow in the 
path of such excellent singer-songwriters as Iris DeMent, Rosie Flores and 
Jimmie Dale Gilmore, whose work falls far outside the narrow stylistic and 
thematic boundaries of country radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding her efforts was Red Moon Records, a tiny Swiss label whose boss, Jurg 
Schapper, sells newspaper advertising for a living and pursues his passion for 
American roots-music on the side. With his help and several overseas tours, 
Browne has developed a promising European following. 
</P>
<P>
 Realistically, one could have hoped that the first album she made with 
complete artistic independence would show solid progress along the commendable 
art-before-commerce track she has chosen. What she has given us is beyond all 
expectations. In a field that already includes striking releases by DeMent and 
Johnny Cash, "Count Me In" is a legitimate contender for the year's best 
country album. 
</P>
<P>
 A key to its excellence is Browne's complete investment in vocal realism. She 
doesn't sing with the diva-magnitude power and purity of a Reba McEntire or a 
Wynonna Judd. There's a taste of tequila shots and tobacco smoke in her voice, 
a frayed edge that combines with a fetching sweetness to give her a wide 
emotional range. She sounds as if she has lived her songs, which mainly take 
place on the rough side of experience. She has an acute sense of phrasing that 
allows her to move from vulnerability to resolve within a single verse. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Baby Goodbye," a bluesy lament with a touch of Billie Holiday (or k.d. 
lang) in it, she plays a character in the last difficult, 
lightheaded-from-weariness throes of declaring a love affair finally, 
irretrievably kaput. Just how difficult that final break can be comes across 
when she sings the line "we won't drag this out, it's all over now" -- moaning 
and stretching "it's all over now" to show that, like it or not, these painful 
endings do become tortured, dragged-out experiences. When a singer can use pure 
tone in this way to shade and comment upon the literal sense of a lyric, she is 
playing the game of vocal phrasing on its highest level. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne's accompaniment on "Count Me In" is no less skilled or dynamic than 
when Curb was funding her sessions and bringing in such big guns as Albert Lee, 
Emmylou Harris and Duane Eddy. A platoon of fine guitarists contributes, 
notably steel ace Jay Dee Maness, electric guitarist Matthew Barnes, and Dennis 
Caplinger, a jack-of-all-strings who provides lustrous fiddle and acoustic 
guitar work and who co-produced the record with Browne. 
</P>
<P>
 The songwriting by Browne and her two collaborators, Barnes and Pat Gallagher, 
is remarkable for its strength and variety. It's impossible to pick one or two 
standout tracks because the quality never lags. Marquee names like Emmylou 
Harris, Mary-Chapin Carpenter and Bonnie Raitt should swarm to cover this 
material like flies to a picnic table. 
</P>
<P>
 The album is paced and sequenced to create a flow of heartbreak and hope that 
intensifies the songs' collective impact and turns them into a unified work. 
Melodic richness is everywhere, whether Browne is singing a folk-pop plaint 
that practically shivers with its deep sense of isolation ("Dear Loretta"), a 
twangy, gumption-filled declaration of strength and resilience ("Trouble's 
Here," "Long Time Gone") or a charming ode to the pleasures and sweet sorrows 
of a fleeting holiday amour ("Red Moon Over Lugano"). 
</P>
<P>
 When she puts a rocker's kick into her music, the results are bracing. The 
leadoff song, "Hearts on the Blue Train," is an elegiac anthem that courses 
with a chiming, Byrds-style guitar line bolstered by muscular rhythm riffs and 
cushioned by a valedictory organ sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 In a just world, Browne's vision of a sad sodality of souls who have been 
through too many empty one-night affairs would be a major hit. It could only 
have been written by somebody who has spent a grueling career on small-club 
bandstands, watching the mating dance unfold and understanding the emotional 
stakes involved. Browne captures the whole cycle of longing and loathing in one 
tight, incisive stanza: 
</P>
<P>
 Hearts talk when they're lonely,  
</P>
<P>
 Turn to strangers late at night,  
</P>
<P>
 Melting long enough to harden  
</P>
<P>
 Before the early morning light.  
</P>
<P>
 Another rocker, "Count Me In," rides a devastating, darkly plunging guitar 
riff that's as dramatic and memorable as the one in Tom Petty's "Refugee." 
</P>
<P>
 "One Tired Man" takes an uncompromising look at an alcoholic drinking himself 
past depression and into the grave. It's a sorrowful, urgent and unflinching 
song that allows for no upbeat ending and refuses the temptation to moralize. 
With it, Browne shows that she is up to giving us a slice of lived life, 
vividly dramatized, truthfully told and followed through to its toughest 
conclusions. You can't ask for much more, except perhaps for a domestic record 
label to jump on this and put it in American stores, where great American music 
belongs.

MUSIC REVIEW; PROSAIC POWER IN WATTS RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre Watts, who played up a cumulative number of keyboard storms at 
Ambassador Auditorium on Thursday, is a virtuoso who lends new meaning to the 
concept of nervous energy. 
</P>
<P>
 His fingers move faster than light. His nimble foot transforms a pedal into a 
riveting machine. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges dynamic obscurities. He zooms into a piece, clutches its gut, 
and lets go only when he arrives at the final whomping cadence -- a destination 
then abandoned with surprising abruptness. 
</P>
<P>
 He commands the resources of a great pianist. No doubt about that. But he 
doesn't always play like one. 
</P>
<P>
 In a demanding and discerning program that surveyed Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, 
Janacek, Chopin and Liszt, he proved himself a master of extrovert prose. 
Introvert poetry was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 His relentless brio left the listener breathless at the climax of Beethoven's 
"Appassionata," which closed the first half of the recital. At the end of the 
formal agenda, he dazzled the furies by storming through Liszt's A-minor Etude, 
No. 6, which happens to explore the same popular Paganini caprice appropriated 
in variations by Rachmaninoff and Brahms, not to mention Boris Blacher and 
Witold Lutoslawski. 
</P>
<P>
 Watts sustained a speedy air of tragic desperation in the two shattering 
movements that remain of Janacek's "I.X. 1905," a.k.a. "From the Street," and 
earned admiration for venturing this standard-repertory detour. 
</P>
<P>
 When six Chopin's etudes required flash, first and foremost, the pianist 
delivered the robust goods. When Liszt depicted a miniature hunting trip in "La 
chasse," Watts galloped off in a cloud of chords. 
</P>
<P>
 A little agitation can go a long way in an evening of solo piano playing, 
however, and Watts gave us a lot. Some of the agitation seemed inspired. Some 
of it seemed perfunctory. 
</P>
<P>
 Haydn's C-major Sonata, Hob. XVI:48, emerged more dutiful than charming, 
though one appreciated Watts' stylish idea of following its rondo finale with a 
Mozartean extension: the A-minor Rondo, K. 511. Here, the pianist reveled in 
propulsive fluidity. Too bad his emotions remained disengaged. 
</P>
<P>
 He approached Beethoven's "Appassionata" as if it were an intimate 
improvisation -- a viable if hardly traditional interpretation. His impetuosity 
precluded any hope of dramatic expansion, however, even in the andante. The 
results -- up to the fiery coda -- were merely hectic, and almost mechanical. 
</P>
<P>
 One always admired Watts' bravura skills. At the same time, one longed for 
better evocations of Haydn's elegance, of Beethoven's nobility, Janacek's 
torture and Chopin's shimmering moonlight. 
</P>
<P>
 After a while, one wished he would just stop and smell the flowers. Repose can 
be a many splendored thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The interesting encore choices included Luciano Berio's "Wasserklavier," 
"Pagodes" from Debussy's "Estampes" and Edward MacDowell's Etude, Opus 46, No. 
2.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; KING MISSILE WAXES POETIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not enough sex organs and too many socks. Such are the issues that fuel the 
peculiar poetry of John S. Hall, a New York nebbish whose verse has penetrated 
further into the rock audience than most because it's attached to the engine of 
a real rock band, King Missile. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Whisky on Thursday, the band's three instrumentalists played sub-Stones 
garage-rock while the dumpy Hall hunched over and stomped around, looking like 
a kid Walter Matthau auditioning for the Beastie Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 He occasionally wandered to the back of the room to chat with fans while the 
musicians soloed, and he wielded a pickax while yelling, "She split my head 
open with a pickax, and I loved every minute of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Obsessive rants ("Look at all my socks . . . can you imagine having so many 
socks?") alternated with intricate metaphysical games and creepy items like 
"These People," which voiced the thoughts of a derelict contemplating the 
murder of a couple that has taken him in. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall and company rushed through last year's hit "Detachable Penis" as if 
trying to escape its novelty-tinged grasp. But the crowd actually gave a warmer 
welcome to "Jesus Was Way Cool," which introduced the Hall sensibility to the 
underground rock audience in 1990. Here Hall was an East Village, 
punk-generation version of beat-era hipster monologuist Lord Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-deprecating charm won the day for Hall and King Missile. As for the 
straight pop songs that they're attempting to integrate, here's a tip: Detach 
and discard. RICHARD CROMELIN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; JUST CALL IT THE SIR DOUGLAS OCTET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Sir Douglas Quintet is back . . . again," said "Sir" Doug Sahm, modifying 
the introduction of the 1969 hit "Mendocino" for the latest reconstitution of 
his old band at the House of Blues. 
</P>
<P>
 The cynical response would be, "Why?" -- especially given that of the eight 
people on stage Thursday (yes, this quintet numbers eight people) only Sahm and 
organist Augie Meyers were part of the original band.But the truth is that 
"Mendocino," with its hippie-Tex-Mex groove, sounded as good in 1994 as it did 
25 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 And there was enough in this show to make the case for the SDQ -- despite only 
two real hits to its name (the other being the 1965 garage-rock classic "She's 
About a Mover") -- having a place in history for its stylistic pioneering. Sahm 
on Thursday spiritedly laid out his rich legacy of Texas styles, from spicy 
polkas to R&B and country-rock.  
</P>
<P>
 It's the latest twist -- trying to mesh the old SDQ sound (led by Meyers' 
trademark staccato Farfisa organ) with a hard rock sound spearheaded by Sahm's 
guitarist son Shawn and former Desert Rose Band fret wizard John Jorgenson -- 
that seemed a little out of place. 
</P>
<P>
 And the claim on history was watered down by too many side-trips, including a 
Creedence Clearwater Revival medley (CCR drummer Doug Clifford is part of the 
new SDQ) and a two-song tribute to fellow '60s Texas rocker Roky Erickson and 
even an encore of ? & the Mysterians' SDQ sound-alike "96 Tears." It was all 
great fun, but it left the impression that maybe Sahm, like Erickson and ?, is 
at heart just another Texas eccentric. STEVE HOCHMAN

THEATER REVIEW; TOP-NOTCH CAST, DIRECTION POWER 'MOE'

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Herb and Scott Rogers take their final bow as producers of La Mirada Theatre's 
"Broadway Series" with an affectionate, infectious production of the Clarke 
Peters musical "Five Guys Named Moe," featuring the "greatest hits" of the 
legendary Louis Jordan and his memorable Tympany Five. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually it's not so much a musical as it is a bouquet to Jordan's 
irrepressible high spirits as heard in his great hit songs, and in some that 
are less familiar but no less buoyant. 
</P>
<P>
 This musical has no book. What it has is more of a page about a young guy 
named Nomax, who has just been jilted by his girlfriend, Lorraine. As he sits 
brooding by his radio -- an anachronistic period floor model with a modern 
cordless phone on top -- the titular five guys jump out and proceed to give 
Nomax advice on handling women. Advice given, the five guys disappear behind 
the radio, and Nomax calls Lorraine to patch things up. 
</P>
<P>
 So who cares if there's no book. The advice is what Nomax needs to hear, and 
the Jordan tunes are what the audience wants. And they get an earful, the sound 
and syncopation of Jordan's best-known recordings, such as "Saturday Night Fish 
Fry," "Caldonia," "Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying" and the very funny title 
song. 
</P>
<P>
 They also get knowledgeable musical direction at the hands of G. Patrick 
Gandy, who knows when the tunes should roll and when they should rock, music 
that set down a solid foundation for pop trends that were waiting over the 
horizon. Gandy's lightness of touch both on piano and as conductor re-creates a 
sound that's timeless while remaining of its period. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Cruz is Nomax, with a mellow, juicy baritone that's just right for 
Jordan's sensitive blues as well as the up-tempo numbers. The Guys -- the sassy 
and witty Bernard Dotson as No Moe, Lance Roberts as Four-Eyed Moe, the 
formidable bass of Dan Tullis as Big Moe, the sly humor and addictive rhythm of 
Harrison White as the ever-hungry Eat Moe, and the high impish energy of Alon 
Williams as Little Moe -- are attuned to a style that goes back half a century, 
and wear it with panache. 
</P>
<P>
 This show, which is not the same as played the Doolittle last summer, has 
minimal production values, but under Bruce Heath's tight direction, and with 
his lively and often intricate choreography, they aren't missed. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Five Guys Named Moe," La Mirada Theatre, 14900 La Mirada Blvd., La Mirada. 
Tuesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7:30 p.m.; Sat.-Sun. matinees, 2:30. Ends

JACQUES BREL'S REAL WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to the review of "Jacques Brel Is Alive & Well & Living in Paris" 
("An Uneven Evening With 'Jacques Brel,' " April 29), it is unfair to judge 
Brel's masterful and creative songs by these "sappy" translations filtered 
through the '60s. It is not this dated, silly show that has been "exalted" in 
the last 30 years but Brel's extraordinary body of work in French. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Blau and Mort Shuman translated and strung together several songs to make 
a popular show that is now all that America knows of Brel. Certainly the 
trivialization of his expressive songs in this show is not his fault, even 
though he did give his permission. In fact, Brel's widow will no longer give 
anyone permission to translate his songs. 
</P>
<P>
 In France, books of literary criticism analyzing his poetry and university 
courses in the understanding and meaning of Brel's work support that his songs 
aren't just music hall tunes for the masses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, he sang humorously about waiting in vain night after night for 
"Madeleine." But, more important, he wrote profoundly of war, loneliness, 
desperation, family, growing old, death and of himself dying in the face of 
cancer. People should do themselves a favor and listen to the real Brel.

THE FIX ON 'SEINFELD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I happen to like "Seinfeld," for the most part, because it looks on everyday 
problems of the so-called "baby boomer" generation based in New York City. But 
I didn't expect the show to be dangerous except perhaps to the very young 
watcher. There is far too much easy promiscuity on every week. There are also 
strange relationships between the two primary characters and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the relationship between George and his family is funny, except 
it highlights the complete lack of communication between the "baby boomer" and 
his family. There is complete deceit in George's attitude, trying to fool his 
parents in everything he tries and fails to do. There is complete 
misunderstanding by George's parents of George, a loser whom they raised but 
for whom they have little compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry also can't relate to his parents. He is generous to them with money, but 
he spends his time trying to deceive them as to his real-life sexual activity. 
His parents are pictured as completely unaware of his "bachelor" lifestyle, and 
the writers seem to think it funny to portray them as stupid. They could be 
funny without being stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 The character Elaine seems to sleep with a new lover almost every week. She 
has already slept with Jerry, but her happy promiscuity is not a good example 
for young people. And there are continuous adolescent judgments made by the 
writers when they attempt to "bravely" open an unorthodox issue. The difficulty 
may be making it funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is a Jewish syndrome taking place. The writers ignore the fact 
that Seinfeld is Jewish. There is the rare joke only by implication and never 
directly. The Jewish part of his life is deliberately avoided. There could be 
lots of funny ideas on this aspect of Jerry's life.

ACTING WITHOUT BARRIERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 What a great story about disabled actor Richard Robert Redlin appearing in 
"Hart to Hart."("Richard Robert Redlin Looks Forward to a Different Role," May 
6). From my experience as an extra, I do think terrible, old barriers are being 
torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 I had polio in one leg and walk with a limp. However, it has not stopped 
directors from putting me in scenes with Warren Beatty, Robert Wagner, Danny 
Aiello and Connie Sellecca. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me tell you, there are few greater triumphs than a director looking across 
a sea of extras and picking a disabled person to do a scene.

'THE PAPER' IS RATED R 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In regard to Charles Neal's May 7 letter ("No, Not Everybody's Laughing at the 
Movies"): 
</P>
<P>
 So, Neal saw people leave the film "The Paper" with their children before it 
ended. Excellent idea.The movie is definitely, emphatically unsuited for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 An R rating should alert filmgoers that there is something iffy about a film's 
message. They might then check it out in advance, so their afternoons can be 
more pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 I am appalled by explicit sex and violence, so I read reviews and boycott 
films that contain it. I am not appalled by explicit language when it fits the 
context, which this did. I found the movie hilarious and Neal's distress more 
out of bounds than the film's vocabulary.

WHERE ART STOPS AND ASSAULT BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Men hanging by their genitals is not artwork and does nothing to increase the 
debate that rape is a brutal crime ("Confronting the Reality and 'Morality' of 
a Brutal Crime," May 4). 
</P>
<P>
 This "artwork" is nothing more than an all-out call for violence against all 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 To increase debate and in the name of gender equity I'd like to suggest 
another exhibit, this one depicting violence against men. How about John Wayne 
Bobbitt lying in bed bleeding to death, while Lorena swings from the ceiling, 
hanging by her genitals? Now that's art.

MASQUERADE ART

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re Alisa Tager's May 3 review ("Emerging Master of Metamorphosis") of Tom 
Friedman's conversion of everyday objects into "elegant works that artfully 
challenge perception": Hogwash! 
</P>
<P>
 There will never be a dearth of absurdities that masquerade as "art" -- nor 
indeed of such gems as: "He challenges the notion that art can lead to 
transcendence by grounding his objects in their commonness." With current works 
concocted from such inspiring ingredients as toilet paper, chewing gum, 
toothpaste and partially sucked Lifesavers glued together with sugar and saliva 
(translation: "spit"), what minimalist masterpiece can we next expect from 
Friedman? Baked excreta? 
</P>
<P>
 Time to grow up, kid! Such childish self-absorption is not becoming when one 
hits 28.

ART REVIEW; 'VARIATIONS' CAPTURES ART OF PHOTOGRAPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is particular pleasure in finding forgotten master art. When the past 
yields work that is effectively new, history ceases to be a nostalgic 
repository and turns vivid. The case in point is a Huntington Gallery 
exhibition of more than 40 images by 19th-Century British photographer Col. 
Stuart Wortley. Titled "Natural Variations," it was organized by guest curator 
Katherine DiGiulio, and it's a good job too, with a handsome and informative 
catalogue.  
</P>
<P>
 Wortley was a respected contemporary of such camera artists as Gustave Le Gray 
and Julia Margaret Cameron. He was considered one of the most daring and 
accomplished photographers of his era. In 1898, nine years after Wortley died 
at age 58, London's Royal Photographic Society honored him with a retrospective 
exhibition. His work has not been on public view since. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to understand why when facing the emotionally charged pictures that 
make up this revival. Fashion? And why, at last, now? Part of the answer to 
that certainly lies in the fact that history has conspired to plant the world's 
finest examples of Wortley's work in, of all places, Southern California. 
Everything on view comes from the combined collections of two museums created 
here by major Anglophiles, Henry and Arabella Huntington and J. Paul Getty. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist's aristocratic lineage reflects both in the fact that as a boy he 
served as page of honor to Queen Victoria and as an adult had to lug around the 
unwieldy handle, Lt.-Col. Archibald Henry Plantagenet Stuart Wortley. Retired 
from the military at 30, he -- like a surprising number of the most adventurous 
early photographers -- answered the expensive and unwieldy calling of gentleman 
amateur of the camera. Today he'd probably do multimedia computer art. 
</P>
<P>
 He founded two substantial photographic businesses to supplement his income 
and contributed journal articles that reflected J.M.W. Turner's influence on 
his art and John Ruskin's impact on his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 None of his pictures looks anything like the entrepreneurial image created by 
knowing his activities. They are, mainly, seascapes dominated by cloudy skies 
of varying mood and provocative shape that invite the dreamers' game of 
imagining fantastic beings in the floating fog. 
</P>
<P>
 The works look like, and pose as, studies at sunset or by moonlight. They are, 
in fact, neither. 
</P>
<P>
 Early camera equipment was so stiff and lenses so demanding that most 
photographers had a terrible time with Wortley's subject matter. Clouds 
disappeared at one exposure. Water flattened out at another. Most practitioners 
solved the problem by doing darkroom tricks, combining skies from one shot with 
water from another. Not Wortley. 
</P>
<P>
 He waited until the sun went behind a cloud bank then clicked the lens so 
quickly that the negative was seriously underexposed and dark. This gained him 
two advantages. The fast exposure stopped motion so he could capture images of 
crashing waves. In one untitled picture they seem about to demolish a little 
seaside town. This got him the critics' accolade of "instantaneous" 
photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time his low-light source suppressed detail, generalizing forms. 
This got him the even higher critical accolade of "breadth of effect." 
</P>
<P>
 The larger results were images that were neither really just tricky, nor 
precisely faithful renderings of what he saw. They have that uncanny quality of 
things that are at once observed and imagined. Wortley had turned photography 
into art.  
</P>
<P>
 He clearly understood this. Later works grow ever more concerned with mood and 
imagination. Their titles become lines of poetry such as Thomas Moore's "The 
world is a crystal ball. How calm, how beautiful comes on/The stilly hours when 
storms are gone." 
</P>
<P>
 In these works thin bands of landscape take on the role of calm rationality, 
while the skies become the brooding, capricious creatures of emotion, now black 
as anger, now as wise and elegiac as a peaceful death. One sky shows clouds 
scudding apart like shiny pearls vaporizing. It feels like an instant of solemn 
ecstasy. 
</P>
<P>
 The pictures are very special. They come together here as the result of 
historical serendipity and create another one. If they look like anything else, 
they look like the pastel sky scapes of the L.A. master Peter Alexander, 
another romantic heir to Turner. 
</P>
<P>

DANCE REVIEW; COLLAGE THEATRE TAKES A 'LAP' POOLSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With their emphasis on spoken and graphic images that link her personal life 
to the mythic subtexts of American advertising, Heidi Duckler's site-specific 
performance events for Collage Dance Theatre increasingly belong to the art 
world far more than the realm of dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Performed Thursday in and around an empty swimming pool at the Sherman 
Oaks/Van Nuys Recreation Center, Duckler's new "Life in the Lap Lane" uses 
dance merely as a garnish. Indeed, it may be the least essential element in a 
spectacle that begins with clever parodies of poolside behavior, then goes off 
the deep end conceptually with a fixation on the devil and the end of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 With the audience seated on bleachers near the shallow end of the Olympic-size 
pool, Duckler inventively exploits the extreme depth of her performing space by 
creating simultaneous zones of action in different planes as well as using the 
hidden recesses of the far end to launch stage trickery galore. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, visual designer Daniel Evans turns the pool walls and floor into 
projection surfaces for apocalyptic slide shows -- and also offers a panorama 
of all the commercial products bearing the name of the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, the devil comes to dominate "Life in the Lap Lane." The pool 
becomes an unlikely metaphor for hell, and Carla Lucero's propulsive score 
(played live) culminates in a "Blood and Fire" aria for Fanny McCartney on the 
high diving board, surrounded by torches. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeniably picturesque, this finale also features the Collage dancers -- in 
flippers and Speedos -- staggering toward the shallow end of the pool like 
waterlogged B-movie monsters. But Duckler's devil-in-the-pool premise just 
doesn't come together, and ultimately seems more of a caprice than a genuine 
concept -- a whimsical evasion for a site-specific artist who somehow lacks a 
specific connection to her site. 
</P>
<P>
 * Collage Dance Theatre repeats "Life in the Lap Lane" today at 8 p.m. in the 
pool at Sherman Oaks/Van Nuys Recreation Center, 14201 Huston St. (one block 
north of Riverside Drive, between Van Nuys and Hazeltine), Sherman Oaks. 
Tickets: $10-$15. For information, call (818) 788-5113.

THEATER REVIEW; AN OVERLONG 'PENGUIN' TAKES FLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Apostolina's first full-length play, "Flight of the Penguin," at the 
Limelight Playhouse in North Hollywood, features a workmanlike plot and 
considerable promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, at its present running time of two hours and 40 minutes, 
Apostolina's inaugural effort is too much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Apostolina, who also performs in the play, has committed the cardinal sin of 
falling too rapturously in love with his own work. Under the tutelage of 
director Steven Ingrassia, the love fest becomes an orgy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingrassia directs his talented cast to linger so lovingly over every bit of 
business that the show's emotional peaks flatten vertiginously into valleys. 
Still, despite pregnant pauses to shame Pinter, there's a sweet, rigorously 
authentic quality to the acting that goes a long way toward ameliorating the 
evening's dramatic and directorial faults. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Maggio plays Rudy, a white stock boy at a huge New York bookstore who 
falls in love with black co-worker Donna (Karen Dyer). Rudy has some unresolved 
conflicts about Karen's race because of a traumatic incident in his past. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggio is typically a gifted performer, but here he seems to be straining for 
effect. Apostolina, who plays Rudy's racist pal Spot, has a nicely offhand 
manner that counterbalances Maggio's self-conscious weightiness. 
</P>
<P>
 As playwright, however, Apostolina displays no such light hand. Streamlined 
pacing and ruthless editing could work wonders for this attenuated drama. At 
present, "The Flight of the Penguin" is a classic example of a play grounded by 
untrammeled sincerity of intention. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Flight of the Penguin," Limelight Playhouse, 10634 Magnolia Blvd., 
North Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Sunday matinees May 
15 and 22, 2 p.m. Ends June 12. $15. (818) 753-7726. Running time: 2 hours, 40

TV REVIEWS; 'INTOLERANCE' PROBES WORLD RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SCHEIDERER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is the biggest problem facing the world today? The population explosion? 
Pollution? War? CNN's documentary "Shades of Intolerance" doesn't flat-out say 
so, but it makes a good case for racial intolerance, a problem that each 
generation must deal with and that none has yet solved. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchored by Susan Rook, "Shades of Intolerance" looks at the dilemma of racism 
around the world, with CNN correspondents filing reports on the influx of 
refugees that has led to the rise of neo-Nazism in Germany, Afrikaner 
resistance to black majority rule in South Africa and the treatment of 
"outsiders" in Japan, a nation that has lived for centuries in self-imposed 
cultural isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Telling a painfully familiar story, the program will be most valuable to those 
unfamiliar with the problems of intolerance in any of these far-flung 
locations.  
</P>
<P>
 Most interesting to the uninitiated is Brazil, a country in denial. Most 
whites there, who make up less than 50% of the population, claim there is no 
racism and cite Carnival as a shining example of that nation's tolerance. But 
the racism is economic, with almost all of the black and mixed-race population 
living in dire circumstances. In Brazil's legislature, only 16 of 503 deputies 
are black.  
</P>
<P>
 But it is in the United States where the problem seems most intractable. A 
quarter of a century ago, the Kerner Commission warned that the United States 
was becoming two unequal societies, one white and one black. Correspondent Gene 
Randall cites the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the fact that there are three 
times as many blacks as whites living in poverty as proof that the problem 
remains unsolved. 
</P>

TV REVIEWS; JOAN, MELISSA RIVERS PORTRAY OWN LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fact that comedian Joan Rivers and her daughter Melissa portray themselves 
is sure to generate additional interest in "Tears and Laughter: The Joan and 
Melissa Rivers Story." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this over-inflated TV movie offers little beyond the novelty of 
seeing these two women re-enact the grief and turmoil that gripped their lives 
after the 1987 suicide of their husband and father, Edgar Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching "Tears and Laughter" is a lot like being locked on an emotional 
treadmill. After Rosenberg's death at the top of the movie, there are 
innumerable scenes featuring Joan or Melissa trying desperately to come to 
terms with feelings of loss or guilt. These moments have minimal staying power, 
in part because little is revealed about the personal qualities that made 
Rosenberg so special to them and the troubles that caused him to take his life. 
Marital problems that led Joan to leave Rosenberg prior to his suicide are 
barely discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tears and Laughter" is being billed as a dramatic story about a rocky 
mother-daughter relationship. Yet Joan and Melissa spend more time apart than 
they do together in this movie. While Joan is off working in show biz, Melissa 
finds herself in a destructive relationship with a fellow college student who 
abuses her. But the film fails to tie together these two stories in a 
dramatically involving manner. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Tears and Laughter: The Joan and Melissa Rivers Story" airs Sunday at 9 
p.m. on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39). JON MATSUMOTO

HEIRLOOMS; TIME PIECES; IN THE HUNTINGTON BEACH HOME OF ANN AND ROY CARLSON, 
TIES TO THEIR SWEDISH ANCESTRY ARE EVIDENT THROUGHOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The bridal clock stands in the corner, looking like a tall, brightly decorated 
wedding cake.  
</P>
<P>
 For two centuries now, the clock -- which is nearly seven feet tall -- has 
stood watch over this family and its comings and goings. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Carlson's great-grandfather built the clock in 1790 in the northern 
Swedish province of Vasterbotten -- just 60 miles south of the Arctic Circle -- 
for his bride. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the clock keeps time in the dining room of the Huntington Beach home of 
Ann and Roy Carlson, a home where the family's ties to their native Sweden and 
ancestors are evident everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple have combined antique pine furniture and accessories that have been 
in each of their families for generations with new pieces -- including a number 
that Roy has built himself. The clean, simple lines of the pine furniture, the 
polished oak floor, the crisp blue accents and the whimsical details of the old 
bridal clock reflect a culture half a world away, yet seem perfectly at home 
and contemporary here.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've lived with this light pine furniture all our lives, so it's funny to 
think it's now in style in this country," said Ann Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the coldness of the Swedish weather, pine trees grow very slowly, 
coming to maturity only after 175 to 200 years. Swedish pine is of a slightly 
different strain of conifer than those grown in other parts of the world and is 
lighter in color, with the wood grain more densely packed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridal clock -- or moraklocka -- looks as it did in 1790. In fact, the 
clock figures prominently in old family pictures that Roy Carlson discovered 
when he bought his family's old homestead in Sweden two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The clock, passed down from one generation to the next, came with the family 
when they moved to the United States in the 1950s.

<P>
 Roy was 12 then, and the move to this country fulfilled a lifelong dream of 
his father's. The clock was not here to stay, however. When Roy's father 
retired and returned to Sweden in 1974, the clock went back too. Then, in 1989, 
after the death of Roy's father, it was once again brought to California. 
</P>
<P>
 The feminine shape of the clock is unique to the region Carlson's family came 
from. Vasterbotten is rich in deep pine forests. The clocks were handmade 
during the long, dark winter months and then presented by the builders as gifts 
to their brides when they married in the summer -- thus the name "bridal 
clock." Often they were hand-painted with flowers and traditional Swedish 
designs that were favorites of the bride. 
</P>
<P>
 Clocks such as these flourished until the end of the 1800s, when the making of 
bridal clocks almost vanished. There are few available even in Sweden today. 
</P>
<P>
 On display at the Nordiska Museum in Stockholm is a bridal clock built in 1844 
by Carlson's grandfather, Karl Nyberg.  
</P>
<P>
 A reproduction of that clock -- which is finished in darker colors -- is in 
the family room of the Carlsons' home. It was built last year by Roy, using as 
a pattern the one his grandfather developed for the original. The pieces built 
by his grandfather are very special, Roy said, because he was both a craftsman 
and a master painter. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in Sweden, where a kitchen is separate and used only for food 
preparation, the family/kitchen/dining room area in the Carlsons' home is at 
the heart of things. 
</P>
<P>
 It is here that the Carlsons and their three children, Christopher, Richard 
and Ingrid, enjoy both Swedish antiques and modern conveniences. It is also 
here that the family and the extended family -- the Carlsons have housed nine 
exchange students throughout the years -- enjoy Ann Carlson's home-made bundt 
cake and hot, strong Swedish coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 In the family room, an antique pullout bed made by Nyberg has been converted 
into a couch. Ann Carlson took an old carpet woven by Roy Carlson's mother and 
covered a cushion with it for comfortable sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the olden days, carpet was used as upholstery material because it was so 
sturdy. I just continued that tradition," said Ann Carlson. During the long 
Swedish winters, the women cut old clothes into strips and then wove them into 
carpet strips about three feet wide. It was one of these that Ann Carlson used 
for her upholstery. 
</P>
<P>
 The table in front of the couch was made by Roy Carlson from old Swedish pine 
boards that he salvaged and had shipped here, while contemporary chairs were 
bought to complete the set. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bruno Matsson lounge chair covered with lambskin, a contemporary Swedish 
design, is a comfortable place to relax. Along one wall, an antique pine chest 
bought by the Carlsons in Sweden in 1976 has been converted into a bar and is 
used to display blue and white wall plates. The motif of white with blue 
flowers on the plates, typically Scandinavian, is used on wallpaper, fabric and 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dining room, a table for eight that the Carlsons bought in Stockholm 
holds an antique vase and a doily crocheted by Ann Carlson's grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 "She used the thinnest thread and the smallest needle to do this work," said 
Ann Carlson. "And she did it until she was 94 years old." Carlson has boxes 
full of her grandmother's delicate work that she uses daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The pine sideboard was made by Roy Carlson for his wife on their 25th wedding 
anniversary, and it holds a Swedish Rorstrand butter storage jar that is almost 
translucent with age and Swedish dishes that Ann Carlson received from her 
grandmother, as well as pottery their children made in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjacent to the dining room is the kitchen that Roy Carlson fitted with pine 
cabinets and a collection of Swedish utensils, including a small birch 
ice-fishing stick, a milk ladle and copper baking forms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carlson living room leans more toward contemporary design, although in the 
corner is a large antique pine chiffonje, or desk, that Ann Carlson found and 
stripped to the natural wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wonderful piece," she said of the desk. "When I was stripping it I 
found a secret drawer hidden way in back." The front of the piece comes down to 
create a desk, or it can be put up to look like a wooden chest. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Carlson home is filled with special pieces, it is the antique bridal 
clock in the dining room that commands the greatest attention.  
</P>
<P>
 It holds a unique position within the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not considered an antique in the traditional sense, but rather as a 
200-year-old useful and beautiful object that can and should be used each day 
by our family and friends. Its having been passed down through five generations 
adds to the sentimental value and helps tie our family roots to the source," 
Roy Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at the clock as a living, working, moving, vocal member of the 
family."

GARDENING; COLOR IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY LILIES; HARDY PLANTS THRIVE IN MANY 
CONDITIONS AND LANDSCAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One variety of day lily is a common sight along roadways: grassy-like clumps 
producing tall spikes of sunny orange and yellow flowers. The hardy perennials 
require so little care that they're often seen in casual, mass plantings. 
</P>
<P>
 But, if your image of day lilies ends there, you'll be missing out on another 
35,000 named varieties of America's favorite perennial -- with more coming 
along every day. The color range of the new hybrids includes near white, shades 
of yellow, orange, red, pink, purple and almost black. Some varieties feature 
flowers with differently colored eye zones on the petals. Sizes range from 
micro-mini to tall. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the newest varieties garnering a lot of attention from day lily lovers 
and the general gardening world is a diminutive plant named 'Black-Eyed 
Stella,' the 1994 winner of All-America Daylily honors. 
</P>
<P>
 This compact plant is an offspring of the much touted day lily 'Stella 
De'Oro,' prized for its long flowering season. 'Black-Eyed Stella' features 
dramatic color -- a dark red eye zone pattern set against golden yellow petals 
-- and a long bloom period. 
</P>
<P>
 John Schoustra, owner of Greenwood Daylilies in Long Beach and a member of the 
Orange County Iris and Daylily Society, reports a blooming season of up to 300 
days. It also has a bloom habit unlike most day lilies. Like its progenitor, 
'Stella De'Oro,' the blossoms open at night and remain open the following day. 
Flower buds of most day lilies open early in the morning and last for just one 
day, hence its name, " Hemerocallis ," derived from a Greek word meaning 
"beautiful for a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Day lily flowers can be enjoyed for more than a day, however, because each 
stalk contains multiple buds, each opening in succession. They can be admired 
on the plant or brought indoors for cut flower arrangements. Individual flowers 
can even be scattered on a dining or coffee table as colorful decorations; they 
don't need to be floated in water because they're so short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 The versatility of day lilies extends to the landscape, because these hardy 
plants will thrive in many conditions. Schoustra recommends using diminutive 
day lilies in landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can be tucked into small spaces, used in place of annuals for color 
beds, planted as borders along pathways or lawn or grown on slopes like a 
ground cover," he said. "Day lilies thrive in low water situations, are 
fire-resistant, pest-resistant and low-maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Greiner of Garden Grove is also a day lily club member and day lily 
fancier. Among her collection of 70 day lilies are more than a dozen small 
varieties that she uses in containers or rock gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're dainty little things, and I like to plant them in containers so the 
blooms can be enjoyed at eye level," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the term miniature refers to the size of the day lily flower. 
Dwarf means the plant itself is small. Another classification is pony , which 
denotes a small plant with full-size flowers. But these are hard to find and 
not popular, because most hybridizers regard them as unattractively out of 
proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoustra likes the dwarf day lilies because the flowers often have details 
such as colored eyes and edges. He calls them "the intimate day lily." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Asten, also a member of the Iris and Daylily Society, has more than 270 
in her collection, plus approximately 1,000 seedlings she's growing in an 
effort to hybridize new varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very versatile plants and can be tucked into just about any 
landscape since they like full sun to partial shade conditions," Asten said. 
"I've got mine planted with roses, iris, vines, bulbs, just about everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they're classified as drought-tolerant, day lilies will produce more 
blooms if they receive regular watering. They also thrive in partial shade but 
will produce more quantities of flowers in full sun. 
</P>
<P>
 In the warm climate of Orange County, day lilies usually extend their 
flowering season, producing abundant amounts from early spring through late 
fall. Although most varieties perform at their best in this region, Schoustra 
cautions against planting 'Stella De'Oro.' In our area, this variety is neither 
dwarf nor long-flowering. He says it needs winter chill because it's naturally 
dormant during winter, and it doesn't like the reflected heat that can occur in 
gardens during hot summer and fall months. 
</P>
<P>
 For increased bloom production, fertilize once monthly during spring and fall 
with a foliar fertilizer like Miracle-Gro or an all-purpose granular 
fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pests rarely damage day lilies, although snails and slugs are attracted to 
their foliage. You can hand pick them or set out saucers of beer, which lure 
the snails to a hasty end.  
</P>
<P>
 Aphids can also attack the foliage during spring but rarely damage the plants. 
They can be combatted by thoroughly hosing the foliage or spraying with a 
nontoxic insecticidal soap mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 After several years in the garden or container, the clumps will become root 
bound and, like other perennials, need dividing in fall, once they stop 
flowering.  
</P>
<P>
 Cut the foliage back, dig around the clump and use the shovel to break up the 
root system and divide into several plants. These can be replanted or shared. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 More about day lily culture and varieties can be learned at the monthly 
meetings of the Orange County Iris and Daylily Club. It meets the second 
Tuesday of every month at the First Presbyterian Church of Garden Grove, 11832 
Euclid Ave. The free meetings start at 7:30 p.m. For information, call (714) 
953-1876. Best Bets 
</P>
<P>
 Here are dwarf varieties of day lilies recommended for Orange County by 
gardeners and growers: 
</P>
<P>
 'Bitsy.' Yellow; 18 inches tall 
</P>
<P>
 'Black-Eyed Stella.' Yellow with red eye; 22 inches

INSIDE & OUT: A HELPING HAND; SEALER WILL HELP PROTECT SANDSTONE FROM EROSION 
</P>

 Q. I have a sandstone bowl mounted on a tile wall that will catch water from a 
pipe, then allow it to overflow through three spouts into a catch basin where 
it is recirculated. I think the sandstone needs to be treated to protect it 
from water erosion; what should I use? 
</P>
<P>
 C.P. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 A. You'll want to use a good quality, water-based sealer, says Joe Gonzales of 
Statueland in Garden Grove. A lacquer-type sealer won't be able to stand up to 
being in continuous contact with water. Let the sandstone dry out for a few 
days, then apply the sealer with a brush. After a few years of use, the 
sandstone will become sealed by the minerals in the water and you won't need to 
reapply the sealer again.

 Q. My dishwasher leaves a dull, white film on the dishes, glass and 
silverware. I've tried switching detergents, using an additive, using less 
detergent, all of which have yielded negative results. What could be causing 
this problem? 
</P>
<P>
 S.W. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 A. Many areas of Orange County have a lot of hard water deposits, which can 
cause problems in the water line to the dishwasher, keeping the dishes from 
getting a good rinse, says Rod Albright of Albright Plumbing & Heating in Los 
Alamitos. But the problem could also be a lack of water flow into and out of 
the dishwasher. Many dishwashers have a water supply line made of copper, which 
can be easily kinked if something pressures it. This prevents a good flow, the 
mineral deposits build up in the tubing, and the water trickles in. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, check the filter at the water inlet, which can get clogged over time. 
Look at the water outlet too; this is often plugged with food particles. If 
you've noticed your dishwasher has streaky, orange iron deposit stains, try 
running it empty a few times with a few spoonfuls of the orange drink Tang in 
the soap dispenser. 
</P>

 Q. We have lots of sun coming into our house in the afternoon, and we'd prefer 
to get outdoor window blinds to keep out the glare, but we haven't been able to 
find them. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 M.A.P. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A. Those outdoor-style blinds aren't around much any more, says Gidon Adlon of 
Bob's Shades & Linoleum in Orange. You may want to try some of the discount 
hardware stores or an imports store such as Pier 1. As an alternative, try a 
solar-type screen on the windows. These fine mesh screens are available at 
glass and shade stores, and they block out the glare and some of the heat while 
still allowing good airflow when the window is open. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. We just bought a house where the previous owner had recently remodeled the 
kitchen with new ceramic tile on the counters and wallpaper. We hate the paper 
and want to get rid of it, which is simple, but every other tile on the counter 
has the same orange-and-black design that the wallpaper has. Is there a way to 
clean it off without damaging the tile? 
</P>
<P>
 S.O. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
 A. Your only choice if you don't like the painted tiles is to remove them, 
says Tere Corrigan of Intile Designs in Anaheim. If the tile was done recently, 
you shouldn't have a problem finding plain ones to match. Once you get them, 
you'll have to hit each painted tile in the middle with a chisel, then take a 
hand scraper and scrape away the old grout and cement. Apply a new coat of 
thin-set with the new tile and let it dry out for a day before reapplying the 
grout. 
</P>

 Q. Does the oil in my lawn mower have to be changed periodically, or can I 
just continue to top off the level before using it? 
</P>
<P>
 W.E. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 A. If you want to keep your mower for a while, absolutely change the oil, says 
landscaper Dave Kata of Santa Ana. If you're mowing a large area, it's good to 
change it after every 10 jobs. The mower is breathing in a lot more dust and 
dirt than your car, and keeping the filter clean and the oil fresh will go a 
long way toward keeping your mower in good shape.

HARDWARE; WHY BATTERIES DIE YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Batteries always seem to die at the worst possible times. It is especially 
frustrating when the battery has recently been charged yet runs out 
unexpectedly early. 
</P>
<P>
 One common cause of prematurely dead batteries is degeneration. Normal usage 
causes the metal plates inside the battery, which produce electricity, to 
slowly erode and gradually lose their capacity. The amount of time this process 
takes depends on the recharger and which type of battery is being used. 
Nickel-cadmium (NiCad) batteries tend to last more than twice as long as the 
older, lead-acid variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcharging can also cut a battery's life span short. Putting too much of a 
charge on a NiCad battery can cause the electrolytes to leak out, which lessens 
power capacity. This is more prevalent with older rechargers, because the newer 
ones receive instructions from a computer-chip sensor that detects how much 
charge the battery needs and can manage. 
</P>
<P>
 Battery manufacturers are working to develop new chemical compositions for 
batteries so they will last longer, be less vulnerable to charge and discharge 
quirks and be safer for the environment than lead, acid or highly toxic 
cadmium.

MAINTENANCE; HOUSE THAT BURPS IS TELLING YOU TO CHECK THE PLUMBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times-Post News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All houses have their distinctive noises -- the creak of particular 
floorboards, the whoosh of the furnace coming on, the whir of the sump pump. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes these noises are comforting, but if they seem to be murmurs of 
trouble, they can be downright annoying. 
</P>
<P>
 Some older homes, for example, have drains that burble and burp -- as if they 
were gasping for air. Well, they probably are. 
</P>
<P>
 Plumbing fixtures need air for the same reason as old-fashioned soda cans you 
opened by making one hole to drink out of, and another to let air in as the 
liquid drained out. If you didn't replace the air, the liquid wouldn't flow 
freely. 
</P>
<P>
 Plumbing fixtures that drain water also need air to flow properly. They get it 
by means of vents, usually pipes that run from the fixture through the walls 
and out through the roof.  
</P>
<P>
 In some new construction, fixtures are placed close to a drain, which can also 
be used as a vent, or close to a wall, so they can be vented through the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 In older construction, the main drain for the toilet continues through the 
roof, to vent sewer gases. Sometimes other fixtures were connected to their own 
vents; but occasionally the toilet drain is the only vent for all the fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 Fixtures that are inadequately vented make a bubbling sound because the system 
is trying to pull the air it needs through the drain traps. 
</P>
<P>
 Inadequate venting also makes drains run slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Vents can get clogged with leaves and other debris, and that can reduce or 
halt the air flow. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's the case, a plumber might be able to clear them out and restore air 
to the system. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the drains burble because there simply aren't enough vents -- and 
that's common in old houses -- the only way to add them is to tear out walls 
and ceilings and make new plumbing connections. And that's a messy and probably 
expensive project. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be worthwhile just to accept the burblings as part of the house's 
conversation.

GARDENING; LAY CAREFUL GROUNDWORK FOR YOUNG PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIENNE COOK, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Annual plants have a time of great fragility as they are getting started. When 
that time occurs depends on whether they are planted in the ground as seedlings 
or sown as seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 For transplanted seedlings, which will include broccoli, cabbage, peppers, 
tomatoes, eggplant and a host of annual flowers, the period of vulnerability 
comes immediately when the small plant is put into foreign ground outside the 
protection of a pot. 
</P>
<P>
 Young seedlings then must hasten to establish a firm foothold in their new 
environment and, thus stressed for a week or two, are vulnerable to a range of 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For varieties that are sown as seed, the delicate period occurs between the 
sowing and the time the sprouts have established their true leaves, which 
resemble the leaves of the adult plant. (A seedling's first leaves typically 
are oval pairs atop a tall, slim stem.) Depending on soil temperatures at the 
time of sowing, this vulnerable period might last two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest threats to plants, whether transplanted seedlings or seeds 
struggling to sprout, are hot, dry winds, burning sun and lack of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some suggestions that will help to reduce attrition and get plants 
and seeds off to a vigorous start in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seed depth. Some seeds won't germinate if they are covered with too much 
soil. Seeds that are small, such as carrots, parsley, basil, dill and cilantro, 
should not be covered too heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 When sowing small seeds, mix them with sand, sugar or something else that is 
light in color so the seeds will be easy to see on the soil surface. Then cover 
the seeds and lighter-colored material with compost or loose granular garden 
soil, just enough so all is concealed. Last, press the area with a wide board 
to ensure maximum contact of the seed surface with soil. 
</P>
<P>
 When sowing larger seeds -- peas, corn, beans, nasturtium, sweet peas, squash, 
melon, cucumber -- scatter or place the seeds to the correct spacing on the 
surface of the soil. Beans typically are two inches apart; corn, eight inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Then push each seed into the ground with your finger, no farther down than 
your second knuckle. The idea is to get the seed one to two inches into the 
ground. Smaller seeds, such as cucumbers, are planted higher; larger ones, such 
as pumpkins, farther down. Bean and pea seeds sometimes will push up to the 
surface as they expand with moisture; they should be shoved back under the soil 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seedling depth. The depth at which a young transplant is placed is as 
important as the seed depth. Nearly all annual varieties respond best to deep 
planting. Most are single stem, meaning that the plants have a main stem that 
emerges from the ground and develops leaves somewhere above ground level. 
</P>
<P>
 A tomato, pepper or broccoli plant, for example, can be planted six to eight 
inches into the ground, deep enough, in some cases, that only the top foliage 
of the original plant is showing above ground. Thus, an eight-inch-tall 
seedling in a pot becomes a two-inch plant in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep planting accomplishes two things: It helps prevent the seedling from 
being dried out by wind and sun, and it promotes the growth of roots along the 
full length of the stem underground, thus anchoring the plant and allowing the 
maximum amount of nutrients to enter it at many points. The fact that some of 
the foliage gets buried in the process never seems to set the plant back. 
</P>
<P>
 A few plants do not like deep planting. Among annuals, these are the ones that 
do not display a main stem; rather, their foliage grows in a clump out of the 
ground. Parsley, chervil, verbena, dahlias, mums and daisies are a few 
examples.  
</P>
<P>
 * Watering. Daily watering is the best way to acclimate seeds or transplants 
to their new environment. A seed bed should be misted or sprayed very lightly; 
transplants can be watered by hand with a watering can or a gentle hose. It's 
very important to water those first few days.

MATERIALS; NAILING DOWN BEST USES FOR SOFT, HARD WOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wood is generally categorized as hardwood or softwood, but the terms don't 
always accurately describe a particular type of wood. Some softwoods, such as 
Douglas fir, are harder than some hardwoods, such as Philippine mahogany. 
</P>
<P>
 Softwoods come from cone-bearing (coniferous) trees such as hemlock, pine, 
cedar and redwood. They are generally cheaper and easier to find than 
hardwoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Softwood is used mainly in structural framing, scaffolding, flooring, 
shingles, decking, concrete forms and other building uses. Some softwoods 
(sugar pine, for instance) are excellent for furniture and moldings. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumberyards and many home centers carry softwoods in standard dimensions and 
lengths, called dimensional lumber. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardwoods come from deciduous trees -- those that seasonally shed their leaves 
such as oak, cherry, birch and maple. Most hardwoods are stronger and 
longer-lasting than softwoods; they usually cost more and have better 
surface-finishing properties. Hardwoods can be cut, joined and turned as 
successfully as softwoods provided your tools are razor-sharp. Not all 
hardwoods are available at lumberyards. You may have to locate a special dealer 
(check under "Lumber" in the Yellow Pages), or order from a woodworking supply 
catalogue. Softwood 
</P>
<P>
 All of these common softwoods are closed grained. 
</P>
<P>
 Western hemlock, with very fine texture, is a lightweight wood that can be 
worked by machine easily. It's used in construction and as the central plywood 
layer. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern red and Western red cedars are both highly decay-resistant and 
lightweight. Both are also fairly easy to work and finish well. Eastern red 
cedar is used for chests and closets. Shingles, moldings and doors as well as 
boats are often made from Western red cedar. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern white pine and sugar pine are lightweight and have a medium texture. 
Both are easy to work and have minimal shrinkage. Eastern white pine is used 
for containers and knotty paneling while sugar pine is commonly used for doors, 
frames and window blinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Redwood has a medium texture, is fairly heavy and is highly decay-resistant. 
It finishes fairly well and is used for boards, joists, posts and outdoor 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas fir has a coarse texture and is fairly heavy. It is moderately 
workable but does not take paint readily. It's used for piling, plywood veneer 
and residential framing. Hardwood 
</P>
<P>
 Closed grain hardwoods include yellow birch, black cherry, true mahogany and 
sugar maple. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellow birch has a medium texture. It's heavy and difficult to work, but it 
finishes well. It's used for cabinets, cupboards, plywood veneer and doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherry, also of medium texture, is fairly heavy and moderately easy to work. 
You'll find it used for furniture, fine veneer paneling and caskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Both true mahogany and Philippine mahogany are highly decay-resistant and easy 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 True mahogany is heavy and is used for furniture, fine veneers and paneling. 
It has a closed grain, fine texture and finishes well. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Philippine mahogany is lightweight and has an open grain and 
variable texture. The finish may be blotchy. It's used in heavy construction, 
industrial flooring and lower-quality furniture and shelving. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar maple is heavy with medium texture. It's difficult to work but finishes 
well. It's used for furniture and flooring such as that found in dance halls 
and bowling alleys.

ORIGINS; AIRING THE DIRTY LAUNDRY BASKET'S HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS V. DiBACCO, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE: DiBacco is a historian at 
American University in Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
 To guesstimate the date of the first clothes hamper is difficult because the 
meaning of "hamper" has varied over time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxford English Dictionary, for instance, defines it as a "large basket or 
wickerwork receptacle with a cover, generally used as a packing case. In 
earlier times, a case or casket generally, but from 1500 usually of 
wickerwork." The dictionary explains how the word would be used in 1552: 
"Hamper for women to put in spindels or bottomes of threade." 
</P>
<P>
 The word hamper in America, according to the Dictionary of American Regional 
English, appears to be Southern in origin and usage. By the early 1800s, 
Southerners deposited fruits, vegetables or grains in a large bin they called a 
"bushel hamper" or "hamper basket." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1897, the clothes hamper was on its way to becoming a popular product: 
Sears, Roebuck and Co. offered wicker models in three sizes for 65 to 85 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 In this century, clothes hampers, baskets or bins have been the subject of no 
small discussion in popular magazines, with several emphases. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Popular Mechanics (May 1930), it was possible to make an 
attractive hamper. The same magazine (June 1936 and January 1938), as well as 
Popular Science (March 1938), ran articles on combining the hamper with a 
dresser, sewing cabinet, dressing table and vanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the magazines demonstrated that the hamper could be hidden or 
movable. Popular Science (January 1940) showed how it could be located under a 
water heater. And House Beautiful, nine years later, illustrated a "built-in, 
but movable, hamper." The magazine's advice: "Be clever about hiding your 
laundry." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the heading "Gracious Gifts," House & Garden's December 1936 issue 
touted a "Hamper Set -- Painted for the bathroom. Hamper, 19 inches tall, 
basket, 14 inches tall. Pink, blue, red, green, yellow, oyster. About $7 a 
set." 
</P>
<P>
 With the new-home construction boom in the 1950s (one-fifth of all housing 
standing in 1960 had been built during the previous 10 years), built-in metal 
wall hampers became widespread. Some even had a place to stow away soap as well 
as clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, hideaway models were ubiquitous, some under the stairs, others under 
counters ("Under the counter go dirty clothes," declared Sunset magazine, July 
1972), a few crowned with Masonite tops (Industrial Arts and Vocational 
Education magazine, January 1951). Then there was a hamper that doubled as a 
"laundry sorter" (Sunset, September 1974). 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, Roebuck's 1966 fall and winter catalogue devoted three pages to 
hampers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampers imported from Italy, Spain and Holland illustrated the traditional 
wicker look, while American models featured ensembles -- bench or upright 
hamper, wastebasket and brush holder -- in vinyl decorated with tapestry, cane 
and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter-century later Sears, Roebuck's catalogue added, thanks to changing 
demographics, an apartment hamper. But hamper history was by no means closed by 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, one firm has introduced molded plastic whale and dinosaur 
hampers for kids (18 by 18 by 30 inches, retailing at $29.99); another has 
devised a roll-around model on nylon casters with a heavy-duty removable 
drawstring bag, and still another has come up with hampers to fit recreational 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The introduction of handcrafted woven maple hampers has provided a high-priced 
alternative for affluent consumers. And hampers in general have been employed 
by those inclined to substitute wadded-up dirty clothes for basketballs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, hampers seem to have a tie with their origin as "packing-cases" in the 
sense that clothes often are left to ripen and emit odors. 
</P>
<P>
 American ingenuity hasn't been stymied by this untoward situation, however; 
remedies range from placing open boxes of baking soda on hamper bottoms in mild 
cases to pouring a layer of cat-box filler in severe ones.

INTERIORS; MINGLING MAKES THE EXOTIC FEEL AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the notable trends in new furniture shown at the recent wholesale 
market in High Point, N.C., is the inclusion of exotic details and materials in 
otherwise straightforward pieces of fairly standard design. Look for these 
pieces in stores in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pulling things from different parts of the world adds excitement," says 
furniture designer Raymond Waites. "Mixing the rough and smooth, primitive and 
sophisticated, expensive and inexpensive livens things up because of the 
contrasts." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees of Masco Home Furnishings, based in High Point, traveled to Egypt, 
Kenya, Cameroon, Indonesia, Ecuador and Peru. In collaboration with CARE, an 
international relief organization, Masco's associated companies each created a 
different collection, drawing on motifs and materials associated with a 
particular country in which CARE is active. A portion of the profits on the 
furniture will be donated to CARE programs in that country.  
</P>
<P>
 Masco's Lineage Home Furnishings chose Kenya for its 15-item group of seating, 
cabinetry and bedroom pieces and employed leather, raw cotton, woven rawhide, 
rattan, bamboo, faux animal horns and woods in exotic finishes.  
</P>
<P>
 Another Masco subsidiary, Drexel Heritage Furnishings, worked with motifs from 
Peru, and its 30-piece furniture collection includes a table shaped like an 
Inca ceremonial cooking vessel and textiles based on Inca design motifs. 
Henredon Furniture selected motifs from Cameroon; LaBarge Mirrors and Marbro 
Lamp Co. worked within an Egyptian, stylistic language. 
</P>
<P>
 Masco was not the only company to exploit the appeal of the exotic. Touches of 
Asia and of the East and West Indies were everywhere, sometimes in unexpected 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 A hexagonal ottoman by the Clyde Pearson Co. is a direct copy of a wooden 
jewelry box from India, says Ruth Clark, design director. Its fabric cover, 
inspired by Indian designs, furthers the effect. The same company also drew on 
low benches found in rural Indian homes in its design of occasional tables.  
</P>
<P>
 The motifs of Africa are recalled in the heavily carved "South Beach" 
collection of seating and cabinets by Jeffco Industries of White Plains, N.Y. 
The carving on legs and aprons of sofas and chairs and all over tables and 
chests recalls African totems.  
</P>
<P>
 Exotic doesn't necessarily mean from a distant continent. Thomasville's "Trail 
of Nations" tables and cabinets are decorated with colorful silk-screened 
designs derived from American Indian motifs as interpreted by designer Kate 
Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
 The decorations on an armoire, for example, are based on Zuni corn dance 
motifs. She ornamented cocktail and end tables with an interpretation of an 
Apache war shield. Hopi and Sioux motifs are also employed on furniture that 
will range from $650 for a lamp table to $2,200 for an armoire. 
</P>
<P>
 The ethnic influence was also rampant on upholstery fabrics. Along with greens 
of every description, Century Furniture's red-to-brown upholstery palette (what 
designer Joann Crews, who selected the fabrics, calls the spice colors) 
dominated in many showroom displays of upholstery. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another example of exotic influences on fabric design is the widespread 
use of fabrics that have the look of animal hides. Faux snakeskin, leopard 
skin, tiger, elephant hide and goatskin were some of the more popular "skin" 
prints covering sofas and chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Accessories offer the most adaptable -- and often most economical -- way to 
add an exotic element to a room, and furniture showrooms were chock-full of 
imported accessories to accentuate an exotic theme suggested by larger items.

AIDS PATIENTS HOME GETS READY TO OPEN; HEALTH CARE: VENTURA'S CHRISTOPHER HOUSE 
IS STILL SCRAMBLING FOR FUNDS TO COVER OPERATING COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The painters are putting the finishing touches on the white-trimmed Victorian 
house. The carpenters are hanging the cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher House, Ventura's first home for AIDS-infected residents, is 
finally ready to open. But even as organizers prepare for their grand opening 
next Saturday, they are scrambling to find the money they will need to run the 
facility day-in, day-out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can house 12 people, but we need the finances to care for those people, to 
feed them," said Teri White, a Christopher House board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters are trying everything from grant applications to garage sales for 
the money they need. The open house will include a silent auction to raise 
funds for the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really want to make this happen the way it should happen," said Betty Jean 
Dye, standing among the used furniture and racks of clothing for sale in her 
Ventura Keys driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye's son, Christopher, dreamed up the project after seeing scores of 
low-income AIDS sufferers stuck in run-down hotels or actually left homeless as 
they died. Christopher succumbed to the disease in 1990, but his family and 
community activists carried on his idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years of labor have produced a beautifully restored house on East 
Thompson Boulevard, furnished and stocked with donations from businesses and 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Just Thursday, Sears Roebuck and Co. gave them 568 towels and 37 pillows. On 
Friday, Westside Electric in Ventura saved the home $1,500 by installing 
electrical fixtures for free. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christopher House management has also negotiated a maze of regulatory 
steps to line up necessary certification for the facility, which will provide 
medical care as well as room and board. 
</P>
<P>
 After a final inspection June 1, the first two or three residents should move 
in, said house manager Tim Rawle. The home could be full with 12 to 15 people 
by July, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take time and a lot more money for the facility to get into 
full operation," Rawle said. "We're opening our doors, but we're opening them 
slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 The six-bedroom house and two cottages behind it will function as a home for 
the AIDS-infected and HIV-positive residents there. The residents will have 
keys to come and go, and each will pay a minimal rent, about 30% of their 
Social Security payment. 
</P>
<P>
 The rent buys them a room and three meals, as well as treatment by four 
attendants and visits from public health nurses and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 The home will cost about $206,000 a year to operate, with a quarter of that 
covered by the minimal rent and by low-income housing certificates from the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developments. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves about $150,000 that the Christopher House board must raise from 
grants, private donations and fund-raisers. As soon as the home is operating, 
it will become eligible for more grants. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, volunteers hope to raise $10,000 at the grand opening next week. 
A silent auction will feature an autographed poster from the movie 
"Philadelphia" with signatures from stars Tom Hanks and Mary Steenburgen; a 
signed print by artist David Hockney, and a weekend at the Erawan Hotel in Palm 
Springs. Mugs and T-shirts will also be for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't underestimate the garage sales. The five sales so far this year have 
brought in a total of $10,000. Betty Jean Dye is holding her second sale of the 
season this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 After four years of work, she is not planning to let the project die for lack 
of money. "It's a dream and it's coming true," Dye said. "Very few people get 
their dream, and Christopher gets his." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher House's grand opening will be held May 21 at 2 p.m. The ceremony, 
which is open to the public, will include live music, a silent auction and 
tours of the house at 856 E. Thompson Blvd. A garage sale benefiting the 
project is going on today and Sunday at 1338 Beachmont St. in Ventura.

CITY TO TAKE STEPS TO CUT HOMELESSNESS; OXNARD: COUNCIL WILL ESTABLISH STEPS TO 
PROMOTE SELF-SUFFICIENCY AND WILL CONSIDER HELPING BUILD A SHELTER FOR THE 
COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Trying to help the nearly 350 homeless people estimated to live on the streets 
of Oxnard, the City Council on Tuesday will establish priorities for reducing 
homelessness and promoting self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also will decide whether to give $8,000 in redevelopment funds to 
a countywide coalition that is developing a plan to build a regional homeless 
shelter for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure that we can establish a coalition to work effectively 
with the homeless," said Councilman Andres Herrera. "It is imperative to us 
that we help our homeless people as much as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the priorities in the city's proposed Comprehensive Homeless Assistance 
Plan are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Developing a regional shelter that would offer a wide range of services to 
the homeless; 
</P>
<P>
 * Finding ways to give the homeless easier access to a number of social 
services, including employment training, primary medical care and homeless 
prevention services; 
</P>
<P>
 * Continuing efforts to develop additional affordable housing resources for 
low-income individuals or families who are homeless or at risk of becoming 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other cities in the county, Herrera said, Oxnard is working with the 
all-volunteer Ventura County Homeless and Housing Coalition to develop the 
regional homeless center. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera said it would be more cost effective to use local resources for 
services such as medical assistance, family budgeting skills and counseling, 
provided under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to maximize the resources available in the county," Herrera said. 
"All the countywide services would be able to use the shelter as a clearing 
house for services provided for the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 The homeless and housing coalition, made up of countywide volunteers, will 
soon begin a study to determine how and where a regional shelter could be 
built, Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no timetable for when the study will be completed, but Herrera said 
city officials are trying to expedite the project, particularly because a 
winter shelter operated at the National Guard Armory in Oxnard has closed, 
Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zoe Christian Center, an Oxnard shelter that housed 180 people, closed in 
July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the worst time we have had since the big Depression," Herrera said. 
"A lot of our homeless people are in fact working-people who don't make enough 
money to afford housing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council is also looking into other ways to help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Councilman Tom E. Holden proposed that the council investigate the 
possibility of using the Boys and Girls Club at 7th Street as a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that plan, the Rescue Mission, the only year-round, nonprofit homeless 
shelter in Oxnard, would operate out of the facility now housing the Boys & 
Girls Club. In turn, the club would use the Oxnard High School site on Fifth 
Street for its operations. The high school is moving into a new facility at 
Gonzalez Road after this school year, Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would provide a facility to the Rescue Mission so they can provide quality 
service to a larger number of homeless people," Holden said. About two years 
ago, most of the Rescue Mission's dormitory was destroyed in a fire and so far 
it has not been able to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Wehry, who heads the 44-bed Rescue Mission, said the city, like the 
county, is in desperate need of more shelters and medical assistance for the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an overwhelming tragedy that we can't provide the assistance those 
people need," Wehry said. "There is more homeless (people) than facilities to 
handle them."

VENTURA TO CONSIDER INTERIM MANAGER; GOVERNMENT: THE COUNCIL COULD SELECT ONE 
OF FOUR CITY DEPARTMENT HEADS UNTIL A PERMANENT REPLACEMENT IS FOUND FOR JOHN 
BAKER. 
</P>

 Looking for someone to fill Ventura's top job when City Manager John Baker 
leaves this summer, City Council members say they may temporarily appoint a 
department head to the spot while they search countrywide for a permanent 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker will vacate his job for the private sector July 1 after nearly 13 years 
at the post, but council members say they probably will not have Baker's 
permanent successor in place before September. Since the council does not meet 
in August, an interim manager's job could be limited to July. 
</P>
<P>
 The four department managers some council members say they would consider for 
the job are: Everett Millais, the city's director of community services; Terry 
Adelman, who oversees the city's finances; Ron Calkins, director of public 
works, and Richard Thomas, the city's chief of police. 
</P>
<P>
 Adelman said he would be eager for the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "My professional goal is to be a city manager," said Adelman, who is traveling 
north on Monday to interview for a city manager's job at another California 
city. However, he said he would rather stay in Ventura if he gets the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have every intention of competing for that job," he said. "I have a 
long-term commitment to Ventura and I would prefer to be here than leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Councilman Jack Tingstrom and Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures said Adelman 
would be one of their top choices for the job, at least on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the other three department heads, Thomas and Calkins say they don't really 
want the job, even temporarily, and Millais will be out of the country for half 
of July. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before John Baker announced his resignation, I had made vacation plans for 
the first part of July," said Millais, who will go to England with his wife and 
son. "To the extent that the timing works and all that, I certainly would 
consider it. The job could be rotated, you know, between the department heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Thomas and Calkins said the job does not appeal to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd consider it because I'm a good soldier, but I would not want to be the 
city manager," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calkins agreed. "I think my value to the city is the greatest as a public 
works director," he said. "I'm enjoying it, and I can't think of any other 
reason why I'd want to do something else right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Three council members, Rosa Lee Measures, Jim Monahan and Jack Tingstrom, 
mentioned Millais as one of their top choices for the job. Millais, director of 
the city's redevelopment efforts and planning procedures, has been with Ventura 
longer than even Baker. Monahan said he would like to consider Millais as a 
permanent replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Steve Bennett and Mayor Tom Buford said they would not comment yet 
on their choices for an interim city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gregory L. Carson could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four department heads under consideration for the job, all have been 
with the city for at least five years, and two have made their entire careers 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, the police chief, began his police career in 1969 as an officer with 
the city of Ventura, and has been with the Police Department ever since. 
Originally from Fresno, he was promoted to chief of the department seven years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Millais has also worked almost entirely in Ventura, taking a job as an 
assistant city planner just out of graduate school in 1973. Since then, the 
native of Upstate New York has worked at a variety of planning jobs at the 
city, receiving a promotion to his current post as director of community 
services in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Calkins started as public works director only a year ago, after spending seven 
years as the city engineer. Before that, he worked for three years as the city 
engineer in Santa Barbara, and 11 years in various jobs with the Ventura County 
Regional Sanitation District. He grew up and went to college in Missouri, and 
moved to the Ventura area in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Adelman, the city's director of management resources, was raised in the 
Oakland area and spent the bulk of his professional life there, working as a 
budget analyst and assistant financial director. He has also worked for five 
years in the private sector as a political consultant, and as an assistant 
treasurer in Alameda County and for the finance department of the Berkeley 
public school system. He came to Ventura seven years ago.

COUNTY MAY SEEK FUNDS FOR PIPELINE STUDY; ENVIRONMENT: THE FEDERAL DOLLARS 
WOULD BE USED TO PAY FOR AN INVENTORY OF THE UNDERGROUND NETWORK FOLLOWING 
RECENT OIL SPILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD and TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to four recent oil spills that fouled local wetlands and rivers, 
the Ventura County Board of Supervisors is considering applying for a federal 
grant to inventory the county's lattice work of underground oil pipes and 
assess the risk of future pipeline ruptures. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff proposal, to be discussed Tuesday, said Federal Emergency Management 
Agency funds may be available to pay for a study of the pipelines, many of 
which are not regulated by any government agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors ordered staff members to examine the pipeline issue in 
December, days after 84,000 gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline into McGrath 
Lake near Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 birds and other species were killed in the December spill, which 
released at least 2,000 barrels of heavy crude oil from a leaking Bush Oil 
pipeline before it was discovered by federal officials Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, smaller oil spills near Piru, Ventura and Santa Paula have raised 
concerns about the condition, age and location of oil and gas pipelines in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Detailed maps of working and abandoned pipelines do not exist, the county 
staff report said. A database of all pipes, chemical facilities, fuel tanks and 
hazardous materials sites should be prepared to help assess the risk of future 
spills, the report suggests. Such a study could cost up to $750,000, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But oil industry representatives say a study by the county is unnecessary, 
since pending legislation would require a statewide inventory and risk 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not oppose a study; what we do oppose is a duplicative effort," said 
Catherine Reheis, managing coordinator for Western States Petroleum Assn., 
which represents about 30 oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) introduced legislation in February 
that would mandate a statewide pipeline inventory, database and mapping effort. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also require a study by the state fire marshal to determine whether 
regulatory gaps exist. Several state agencies now share regulation of 
pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill is in the Ways and Means Committee, a spokesman for the assemblyman's 
office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reheis also questioned the rationale for using federal disaster funds for a 
pipeline study. "To take FEMA funds and set up an inventory of pipelines in 
Ventura County . . . to us is a far stretch," Reheis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Susan K. Lacey said the county could not afford to inventory the 
pipelines and other facilities without the federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be some really old lines that we don't even know of yet," Lacey 
said. "We need to know where those lines are." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials who regulate pipelines and respond to oil spills said they see 
nothing wrong with a county conducting its own inventory, regardless of what 
the state does. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't aware of any county that has done this," said Pam Morris, a 
spokeswoman for the state Division of Oil and Gas, which regulates pipelines in 
oil fields but not the long-haul transport lines. "We believe it is a good idea 
to develop an inventory of pipelines in high-risk areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Oil companies typically keep records of their own pipes, Morris said, but oil 
spills statewide in recent years have called attention to the need to identify 
pipes that are at risk of rupture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had problems," said Department of Fish and Game Capt. Roger Reese, 
whose Ventura-based unit responded to the recent spills. "We don't have an 
active program to inspect facilities or anticipate spills now. We can use any 
information . . . to identify where leaks come from when they occur." 
</P>
<P>
 But in meetings with county staff members, oil industry workers downplayed the 
danger of future leaks, saying "the risk of future oil pipeline spills has been 
overestimated and that existing regulatory requirements are sufficient," 
according to the staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 County staff members have met with representatives from most of the oil 
companies doing business in Ventura County to assess the status of their 
pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It probably would be more appropriate to make sure whatever is done is 
coordinated through state agencies," said Chevron Corp. spokesman G. Michael 
Marcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Hatch, vice president of corporate development for Berry Petroleum, 
declined to comment on the proposal, saying, "I really don't know what they're 
looking at." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch said his company is putting together a comprehensive plan for the 
Department of Fish and Game, detailing pipeline sites and other data. He said 
many oil companies are taking similar actions on their own.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; SCHOOL DISTRICT OBSERVES 125TH 
ANNIVERSARY

 When the first six children entered the granary-turned-schoolhouse on Somis 
Road in 1868, early organizers of the Pleasant Valley School District were 
simply looking to educate their children closer to home, avoiding the long trek 
by wagon to Ventura where the area's only school was located. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 125 years later, the district has grown to an institution with nearly 
7,000 students and 13 schools and is one of the oldest elementary school 
districts in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In recognition of that history, district officials will launch an anniversary 
celebration at 3 p.m. today at Constitution Park in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The anniversary program, which is open to the public, will feature student 
music, dance and drama presentations as well as speeches and proclamations by 
district and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community and the school district have roots that run deep," said 
Pleasant Valley spokesman Sherry Jean Cole. "I think the district has been a 
unifying element for the city over the years. We have been fortunate (to have 
received) all the community support that we have enjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
 Also to be featured during the outdoor birthday party will be presentations 
highlighting student and alumni achievements and a salute to Tierra Linda 
School -- the district's newest facility which is scheduled to open this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Local service clubs will provide food and refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
 In commemoration of the anniversary, a booklet detailing the history of the 
district is available to the public for $4. The booklet contains a timeline of 
significant events in the district's history along with information on each of 
its 13 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Displays of district historical photographs and memorabilia are open for 
viewing at the district office at 600 Temple Ave., City Hall at 601 Carmen 
Drive, the Camarillo Public Library at 3100 Ponderosa Drive and the Pleasant 
Valley Historical Society Museum at 720 N. Las Posas Road. J.E. MITCHELL

 Authorities on Friday identified a man who was discovered stabbed to death in 
the bedroom of his El Rio home. 
</P>
<P>
 Braulio Bojorquev, 25, was found Thursday by friends of his roommate who 
became concerned when he couldn't reach Bojorquev by phone for several days, 
said Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Craig Husband.  
</P>
<P>
 When the roommate's brother and friends broke into the house in the 800 block 
of Simon Way, they found Bojorquev's body in the bedroom, Husband said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said he had been dead for more than 24 hours, but declined to 
release more details. 
</P>
<P>
 Bojorquev worked on repairing and painting cars, authorities said. He is 
survived by his wife and other relatives in Tijuana. PEGGY Y. LEE

 Oxnard police will be sending "baby-face" teen-agers into liquor stores 
throughout the city as part of a sting operation to end illegal sales of 
alcohol to minors, police announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will ask cadets and students, ages 17 or 18, to go into businesses and 
try to buy alcohol, said Detective Bob Camarillo, who is heading the sting 
operation. If a store clerk asks for identification, the decoys will present 
driver's licenses showing their real age, Camarillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to use baby-face minors," Camarillo said. The program will begin next 
week and continue through the second week of June. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses found violating the law will face fines and could lose their 
alcohol licenses, Camarillo said. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; BOY WINS COMPUTER DRAFTING AWARD 
</P>

<P>
 Adrian Laveaga only learned last year how to do drafting on a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has had no computer at home to use for practice. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 17-year-old Channel Islands High School senior nevertheless captured 
first prize for technical computer-aided drafting in a recent state competition 
sponsored by the Vocational Industrial Clubs of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Channel Islands High student, junior Devin Buck, won fifth place in 
the competition for traditional board drafting. 
</P>
<P>
 And a team of seven Oxnard High School students was honored for its 
performance in the contest's ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian, who plans to attend Oxnard College next year, said he had already 
mastered drafting by hand, or board drafting, when he began to learn to use the 
computer at school. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, he said, computer-aided drafting seemed more difficult. Then as he 
continued to spend hours each week practicing, he realized the advantages of 
doing the job by computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to use," Adrian said. "Corrections can be made. You can do so 
much more with the computer than you can with a triangle and pencil." 
</P>
<P>
 At the state competition, which was held in Anaheim in late April, Adrian and 
the 18 other state finalists in his division had to perform under deadline. 
Given a picture of a machine part and two pages of written instructions, each 
student had three hours to make computer drawings of the piece of machinery, 
complete with size descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard High School team won third place for its recital of the meaning of 
the Vocational Industrial Clubs of America emblem in the contest ceremonies and 
second place for its recital of the organization's creed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard High team members are Kevin Escalante, Rene Enriquez, Jared Gregg, 
Christine Kirk, Jose Martinez, Louie Mancha and Lauren Runyan. MAIA DAVIS

 Investigators said they have not yet discovered what caused a two-alarm house 
fire that gutted a Ventura house and made homeless a mother and 15-month-old 
baby.

 Dana Taylor and her daughter Vivian have received help from the Ventura County 
Chapter of the American Red Cross, officials said.They will stay at a motel

 Taylor was renting a house in the 600 block of Sheridan Way when it caught 
fire Wednesday evening, authorities said. Neighbors tried to put out the fire 
by breaking windows and opening doors, but that only caused the fire to spread 
more quickly, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters thought the baby was in the house and searched it twice. Taylor 
and her daughter returned from the grocery store to a home charred by fire.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; TRIAL OF EX-CARD CLUB PROMOTERS DELAYED

<TEXT>
<P>
 The trial of two former Oxnard card club promoters accused of stealing $10,000 
from investors in a Santa Paula construction deal was postponed Friday to give 
a state appeals court a chance to weigh the validity of the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendants Michael E. Wooten, 45, and Frank Marasco, 48, have asked the 2nd 
District Court of Appeal to overturn a Ventura County judge's decision that 
requires them to stand trial.The trial was scheduled to start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants contend prosecutors lack evidence that they broke any laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the men submitted a false $10,000 voucher to a consortium of 
Ventura County investors for work on a Santa Paula development project. Instead 
of paying a construction firm to supervise the $10,000 job, Wooten of Camarillo 
and Marasco of Ventura divided the money between themselves, a prosecutor 
alleged in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Allan Steele initially disagreed with prosecutors and 
said he planned to dismiss the charge. The appeal was filed after Steele 
changed his mind May 2 and ordered the defendants to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Louis B. (Chuck) Samonsky, who represents Marasco, said the appeals 
court has delayed the trial to give prosecutors time to state why they believe 
the men should go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has got their attention enough that they want to hear from the district 
attorney before issuing" a ruling, Samonsky said of the appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff G. Bennett said the appeals court has given 
prosecutors until May 23 to respond. "It's not unusual," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an another matter, Wooten and Marasco pleaded guilty last month to one 
misdemeanor count of money laundering in connection with small contributions to 
some Oxnard political campaigns. They were fined $3,000 each. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; DEFENSE IN MURDER CASE SEEKS TRIAL MOVE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Public defenders asked a judge Friday to move the murder trial of a Thousand 
Oaks teen-ager out of Ventura County, several court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath has set a hearing for June 3 to hear 
the change-of-venue motion in the murder case of Mark Scott Thornton, charged 
with the Sept. 14 kidnaping and killing of Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say O'Sullivan, 34, the mother of a young son, was fatally shot by an 
attacker who then stole her vehicle. Her body was found amid brush in the Santa 
Monica Mountains 12 days after she disappeared. Thornton, 19, also faces a 
special allegation attached to the murder charge that could send him to the gas 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said Friday that he received the defense 
motion to move the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of it was provided to Judge McGrath, the judge's secretary and 
Assistant Public Defender Duane A. Dammeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath has blocked public access to all documents filed in court concerning 
the case. The Times and Ventura County Newspapers have asked the judge to 
unseal those documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he plans to release the public records after he hears the 
change-of-venue motion, which the district attorney's office intends to fight, 
Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have contended in court that Thornton cannot get a fair 
trial in Ventura County because of heavy pretrial publicity. But Kossoris said 
other cases with more publicity have been tried in counties where alleged 
crimes have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot more notorious cases than this where a fair jury was 
found," Kossoris said, noting trials moved from Ventura County have usually 
involved cases in which suspects are accused of the torture or mutilation 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's change-of-venue motion was filed by Deputy Public Defenders Howard J. 
Asher and Susan R. Olson, who were not available for comment. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 3 MEN ARRESTED ON DRUG CHARGES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After busting a suspected drug-dealing operation, Ventura County narcotics 
detectives said Friday they have arrested two Oxnard men and a Los Angeles 
County man on charges they were supplying methamphetamine to Thousand Oaks 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives learned that Albert Martinez, 23, of Oxnard allegedly had been 
delivering the illegal stimulant to drug users in the Thousand Oaks area, 
according to a report by Sgt. Gary Pentis. 
</P>
<P>
 During a monthlong undercover investigation, detectives bought some of the 
drug from Martinez and then began watching his activities, Pentis' report said. 
After obtaining a search warrant for his home and vehicle, they ordered a 
larger quantity of methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday afternoon, Martinez sent Albert Reyes, 18, of Oxnard and Agustin 
Valdonado, 22, of La Puente to deliver the drug to the undercover detectives, 
who arrested them, Pentis reported. Detectives then arrested Martinez at home, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the investigation, detectives seized about 6 ounces of methamphetamine, 
worth about $15,000 on the street, it said. 
</P>
<P>

SEC SAYS FIRST PENSION RAN SCHEME; REACTION: INVESTORS, SOME WHOSE LIFE SAVINGS 
ARE FROZEN, ARE INDIGNANT OVER POSSIBLE LOSS. A FEW REMAIN HOPEFUL AT LEAST 
SOME OF THE MONEY WILL BE RECOVERED.

<P>
 First Pension Corp. investors expressed shock Friday on learning their 
retirement funds were frozen at best and possibly lost to fraud and theft. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the kind of thing you wouldn't believe in a 'B' movie," said retired 
aerospace engineer Irvin Starr, 64. "I'm an experienced investor, and I didn't 
have the slightest inkling that something was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds McDonnell Douglas Co. retiree Jose Hernandez, 70, of La Palma: "I hope 
it's not as bad as it looks." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had bad news for First 
Pension's estimated 8,000 clients -- individuals and small-business operators 
from across Southern California. In court papers, the SEC alleged that First 
Pension and its affiliates were nothing more than a massive pyramid scheme that 
used money from later investors to pay dividends to earlier ones. At the SEC's 
request, a federal judge Friday froze the assets of First Pension, its top 
officials and its affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crimes of this kind are unbelievably ruthless and vicious," said 
small-business owner Cynthia Michel. "I can't comprehend how someone could be 
so unethical. Now I have to hire another company to handle the pension program, 
and how will I know if I can trust it? This makes me suspicious of everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Michel decided to start a profit-sharing pension program for employees of her 
small Hermosa Beach public relations firm three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to do all the paperwork it would involve, and my accountant 
recommended First Pension as a pension administrator," she said. "He told me 
that the company had been around for years and that it was very reputable." 
</P>
<P>
 Michel entrusted First Pension with a total of $11,000 on behalf of her four 
employees. She was impressed with First Pension's thorough record-keeping. "All 
of their work came on time every month, and was very detailed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the fate of her workers' retirement fund is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr, the retired aerospace engineer, said he started worrying two weeks ago 
when he was unable to reach First Pension Corp. affiliate Vestcorp Securities 
Inc. by telephone from his home in Hercules, north of Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 When he dialed Vestcorp's office, a tape-recorded message told him to punch in 
a password. "That was a bad sign, because they'd never demanded a password 
before," said Starr, who said he had invested $80,000 through Vestcorp. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr, who said he had grown to trust the company over the years, is now 
clamoring for information, searching computer databases for newspaper stories 
and contacting other investors by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who said he invested more than $100,000 with the company, was 
preparing for a back-yard barbecue at his home in La Palma when word of the SEC 
allegations broke Friday. He said his first whiff of trouble came three weeks 
ago when First Pension was forced into bankruptcy by several creditors. "These 
people, I don't know where the nerve comes from. They're like leeches on 
society," he said. "I hope the law will take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez may be luckier than most. He owns his home and retired with a full 
pension from the McDonnell Douglas Corp. plant in Long Beach in 1989. It was 
what he calls "extra money" that he put into the First Pension accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 While many investors said the funds they placed with First Pension didn't 
represent their life savings, others like Glendale resident John Keeler say 
they may have lost everything. 
</P>
<P>
 About three years ago, the 67-year-old former insurance company inspector put 
his savings into four different First Pension investment pools. In January, he 
received his most recent dividend check, which said the value of his accounts 
stood at $5,750. His only other retirement income, he said, is $1,000 a month 
from Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely angry that I couldn't trust this money, which is just a minimal 
nest egg, to somebody," Keeler said. "It's not earth-shattering in terms of 
money, but it's about all I have." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeler said he has begun looking for part-time work inspecting restaurants for 
insurance companies, the same job he did before he retired six years ago. He 
has one work contract that he'll begin next week. He figures his First Pension 
investment "is a total loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the company's investors are that disheartened, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Chet Galutia, a retired Buena Park dentist who invested more than $100,000, 
said he figures he'll eventually see most of his money. "There should be some 
property underneath the pile" of legal paperwork this case will generate, he 
said. Galutia said he and his wife invested because he believed that second 
trust deeds "were a good way to make money in California" and because he saw 
none of the classic warning signs of an investment scheme when he talked to 
First Pension Corp. sales agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interest rates were never out of (line) with what you could get someplace 
else," he said. "The attempts are being made to say that it was a Ponzi scheme 
but there was never that large of a return." His most recent dividend checks 
represented annual returns of 12% to 13%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows when you invest," he said. "You take a chance. You do due 
diligence and you hope to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Investment risks are just a part of life, he said. "I hate crybabies." 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news from the SEC seems hard to believe for some. Not all are 
convinced that the SEC could be correct in saying that the trust deeds of First 
Pension cannot be found and may never have existed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take the worst case and say all the present capital has vanished; there's 
still a nice income stream from the mortgages (that's flowing to the parent 
company)," said Gordon Reiter, a 59-year-old aerospace retiree in Torrance. "I 
think the parent company is still in operation in Irvine, and I think somebody 
needs to get in there and grab ahold of the records." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its bankruptcy, the company now is being operated by a 
court-appointed trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiter has a lot at stake: nearly $300,000 he has pumped into the firm over 
the years "is vital to my retirement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Junko (Betty) Wise says she thinks she knows why so many people became 
involved with First Pension Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "The saleslady was just so convincing," said the 67-year-old Los Angeles 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son warned me that if it sounded too good to be true it probably was, and 
I guess he was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Wise, a retired customs broker, said she invested a total of $24,000 with 
Cooper's companies. Of that, $14,000 went into an investment account that has 
paid her $6,000 in cash dividends over the past four years and $10,000 of it 
was placed in an IRA account that she thought had grown to $20,000 through the 
reinvestment of quarterly interest earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I won't see much of it," Wise said, remarking that she is thankful 
her son dampened her ardor for further investing with First Pension. "I didn't 
lose everything," she said, "but $24,000 is $24,000."

SEC SAYS FIRST PENSION RAN SCHEME; INQUIRY: IRVINE-BASED FIRM MISLED CLIENTS 
INTO INVESTING IN MORTGAGES THAT DID NOT EXIST, THE AGENCY ALLEGES. AS MUCH AS 
$124 MILLION MAY BE LOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of Irvine-based First Pension Corp. operated an elaborate pyramid 
scheme that misled clients into thinking they were investing in mortgages that 
in fact did not exist, federal authorities disclosed Friday in alleging that as 
much as $124 million may have been lost to fraud and outright theft. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegation in federal court by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
is the most complete version so far of how the scheme may have worked.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency said as much as $99 million of clients' funds may not have been 
invested in real estate loans at all, despite the investment promoters' 
promises. That means the possibility of recovery may be much lower for many 
customers than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations were made by the SEC against prominent Orange County 
businessman William E. Cooper and two of his long-term associates, Valerie 
Jensen and Robert E. Lindley. The three have been partners in a raft of 
brokerages and real estate deals over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC asked for and received from U.S. District Judge Manuel Real an order 
freezing the assets of Cooper, Lindley, Jensen and five firms they established 
or operated. These include First Pension Corp., its parent First Diversified 
Financial Services, Vestcorp Securities Inc. and Ernest-Edwards & Associates. 
The agency also moved to freeze 31 bank accounts held by the trio and their 
affiliated firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Over and above the $99 million at risk in the real estate partnerships, the 
SEC charged that an additional $25 million may have been lost through outright 
theft of clients' checks, forgery of corporate checks and the establishment of 
fraudulent bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 In April alone, according to court papers filed by the SEC, Cooper forged 114 
checks totaling $1.3 million on a custodial account held at Denver-based Summit 
Trust Services, a firm he and his partners had established to handle their 
clients' money.  
</P>
<P>
 Cooper also arranged in late March or early April -- a period when income tax 
deadlines meant that clients' contributions to their First Pension accounts 
would have been at a yearly peak -- to give himself personal access to First 
Pension's incoming mail, court papers say. 
</P>
<P>
 In that period, an unknown number of clients' incoming checks disappeared, 
many of which were eventually deposited in illicit bank accounts opened by 
Cooper and Lindley, the SEC alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension declared bankruptcy April 22, one day after Colorado state 
authorities seized Summit Trust on a complaint by its president that millions 
in client funds could not be accounted for.  
</P>
<P>
 First Pension had an estimated 8,000 clients whose accounts totaled about $350 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension functioned as a pension fund administrator, serving people who 
wished to make individual choices about where to invest their individual 
retirement accounts, Keogh accounts or other retirement funds. In practice, 
many of its customers were persuaded to put their money into real estate 
limited partnerships marketed by First Diversified and Vestcorp. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Ernest-Edwards, the name of which comes from Cooper's and Lindley's 
middle names, the SEC charged that it was established as a subterfuge to allow 
the three principals to siphon First Pension clients' cash out of custodial 
bank accounts held by Summit Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's criminal attorney, Robert C. Bonner, could not be reached Friday. 
Jensen's lawyer, Donald Smaltz, said he would not comment on the allegations 
until he had seen the SEC's court filing.  
</P>
<P>
 Bonner returned to private practice in October after stints as chief of the 
federal Drug Enforcement Administration, as U.S. attorney and as a federal 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindley's attorney, Russell Hayman, said: "The SEC is aware that Mr. Lindley 
is cooperating with the FBI and the U.S. attorney, and part of that involves 
cooperation with the SEC."  
</P>
<P>
 He added that he was not surprised at the agency's motion to freeze the 
principals' assets, but he would not comment further.  
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's and Jensen's lawyers have both said previously that their clients 
were cooperating with federal authorities investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the SEC said Friday that Jensen and Lindley both pleaded the Fifth 
Amendment when asked about their personal finances; Cooper refused to appear 
before the agency at all. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the SEC's case are 218 limited partnerships that Vestcorp 
established and sold to First Pension clients beginning in 1981, raising at 
least $99 million. The firm said the partnerships would invest in second or 
junior trust deeds, or mortgages, and that they would return dividends of as 
much as 28% annually from the borrowers' repayments on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC alleges that, for the most part, the money was not invested in real 
estate at all. According to testimony by Ana Maritza Golan, First Pension's 
operations manager, on Jensen's instruction she set up a secret account known 
as the "99 minifund" from which investors in the real estate partnerships 
received what purportedly was income distributions from mortgages.  
</P>
<P>
 But the agency says no such income came in and that the investors were 
actually getting money other clients had sent to First Pension for their own 
accounts. As much as $2.1 million passed through the 99 minifund between 1988 
and October, 1993, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership investors were largely unable to get any information on the 
nature of these mortgages, including details on the location of the underlying 
property or the credit-worthiness of the borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The dearth of information afflicted Vestcorp's own officers. SEC documents say 
that in 1991, Rodger Rusch, then president of Vestcorp, had tried and failed to 
find official records that trust deeds had been transferred to the limited 
partnerships his firm had marketed.  
</P>
<P>
 Confronted by Rusch, Cooper told him he had decided to hold the trust deeds in 
his own name or those of firms he controlled, rather than paying the $10 fee 
and going through the trouble of recording the transfers to the partnerships, 
the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, that didn't make any sense," said Lisa A. Gok, the SEC's assistant 
regional director for enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a lawyer for Cooper told the SEC that Cooper did not have possession 
of any property records underlying the purported loans. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC officials said Friday that the entire scheme may have begun to collapse 
when officers of Summit Trust asked First Pension to reconcile records showing 
a $25-million discrepancy between the cash Summit had on hand from First 
Pension client accounts and the higher amount showed on First Pension's own 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen told Summit President Kenneth Lyon that the missing money had been 
transferred to Ernest-Edwards for further investment in bank certificates of 
deposit. Summit subsequently discovered that none of the banks purportedly 
holding the firm's accounts had heard of Ernest-Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon "immediately alerted the Colorado Division of Banking," the SEC said, and 
the division seized the trust company.

OWNER COOPER LONG A FIXTURE IN O.C. CIRCLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When politically connected investor William E. Cooper bought former Sen. John 
Seymour's real estate brokerage in 1981, Cooper was riding high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County's growth and inflation has made a lot of people wealthy," 
Cooper said at the time. "Certainly, John and I and others rode that surge." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a decade later, fortunes have changed for Cooper. The brokerage 
faltered, Seymour no longer speaks to him, his pension management firm has 
filed for bankruptcy, his sprawling Villa Park mansion is for sale, and Friday 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission froze all his assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators alleged Friday that Cooper's Irvine pension firm, First 
Pension Corp., may have lost or misappropriated as much as $124 million in 
clients' funds. Cooper has been unavailable for comment, but his lawyer said he 
was cooperating with federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, 50, who grew up in Southern California, has been a fixture in Orange 
County business, social and political circles for the past 20 years. He was a 
member of the GOP's Lincoln Club and one of the county's biggest campaign 
contributors at one time. He was a big booster of Seymour, former Orange County 
Supervisor Don R. Roth and others. And last year, he was the driving force 
behind an unsuccessful effort to bring a card club and casino to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics isn't the 6-foot-1, 190-pound Cooper's only passion. The bearded 
outdoorsman is an avid skier and camper, friends said. In his second marriage, 
he wedded Terri in the mid-1980s. They have one son, Paden. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, efforts to contact Cooper at several of his businesses and at home 
were unsuccessful. The windows were covered at the couple's $700,000-plus, 
three-bedroom, English-style home in Villa Park's exclusive Sommerset 
neighborhood. Sticking above a wrought iron fence leading to Cooper's front 
door was a red, white and blue sign that warned: "Private Property, No 
Trespassing." Underneath that, a second sign stated: "High Voltage." 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Cooper served on the board of directors for the Orangewood Children's 
Home until her resignation last month. Supervisor William G. Steiner, a former 
Orangewood executive director, said she told board members that the family was 
moving to Santa Barbara. St. Joseph's Hospital was another beneficiary of the 
Coopers' support. 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour, the former U.S. senator who now heads the state housing finance 
agency, said he counted Cooper among his supporters until they fell out over 
business finances when Cooper failed to make required payments on the Anaheim 
brokerage business. 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour said that selling his brokerage to Cooper cost him "considerable sums" 
and that he has not spoken with Cooper since. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he recently described Cooper as "a good Republican" who played a 
low-key role in numerous local campaigns. "He was a regular at political 
fund-raisers but he wasn't a real forthcoming or vocal kind of guy," said 
Seymour, who began his political career as mayor of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Many recall Cooper's financial support of then-County Supervisor Roth in a 
bitter 1986 campaign against former Orange Councilman Jim Beam. That year, 
Cooper provided Roth more than $19,000 in contributions and loans to help him 
win election. Roth, who was not available for comment Friday, resigned his 
office last year just before he pleaded guilty to certain state ethics 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate was the basis of Cooper's fortune. He started in the mortgage 
business when he was only 18 as a loan officer trainee in 1961. He later worked 
for Union Home Loan as a loan officer and branch manager and then moved to 
Capital Home Loan, working there in various capacities and rising to general 
manager before he left in 1974.  
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, Cooper formed Continental Home Loan, a loan brokerage, 
which later became a subsidiary of another Cooper company, First Diversified 
Financial Services. It was then that Cooper bought Seymour's real estate 
brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
 Things looked good for Cooper until 1984, when he ran into trouble after 
$577,850 was diverted from a trust fund, L.B. Mortgage Servicing Co., according 
to the California Department of Real Estate. Cooper's real estate license was 
revoked and then reinstated with restrictions for negligence and failing to 
supervise the company. The restrictions were lifted in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's career appears to have progressed without incident since that episode 
-- until last month. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 5, First Pension President Valerie Jensen abruptly resigned and 
Cooper replaced her. Although he had rarely been seen around the company's 
Irvine headquarters until then, former employees say Cooper helped start the 
company in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper also held interests in several limited partnerships, including 
Euclid-Ball ASC Ltd., which financed construction of surgical centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals of that venture once included Glen Belka, a former tax law 
specialist who served as president of the venture. When contacted at his San 
Bernardino home Friday, Belka said he hasn't spoken to Cooper in six years.  
</P>
<P>
 "Cooper purchased all my interest, and I was terminated in 1985," Belka said. 
"All I know about Cooper is that he ran everything, he did everything and he 
was president of everything. Do I wish I'd never met him? The answer is yes."  
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, Cooper and business partner Robert E. Lindley were financial 
backers of an unsuccessful proposal to bring a card club to Anaheim. The two 
men were active in forming the investment group called Southland Entertainment 
Properties Inc., which headed the project. But City Council members, several of 
whom received campaign donations from Cooper, rejected the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been around the Anaheim and Orange County business scene for quite a 
while. He's sharp, focused and very businesslike," said Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, 
who received $1,800 in campaign contributions from Cooper from 1989-92. "Not at 
all pushy. . . . He's low key and always seemed to have done his homework."

FATHER WINS SUIT IN 'FALSE MEMORY' CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a landmark case that could fundamentally alter how therapists do their jobs 
-- and could increase their liability -- a Napa Valley Superior Court jury 
ruled Friday that two Orange County therapists implanted false memories of 
child abuse in a patient and wrongly harmed her father. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury decided on a 10-2 vote that therapist Marche Isabella, Dr. Richard 
Rose, chief of psychiatry at Western Medical Center in Anaheim, and the 
hospital were negligent in their treatment of Holly Ramona, now 23. It awarded 
her father $500,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has received national attention because it marks the first time that 
a court has allowed a therapist to be sued for implanting false memories. It 
has been at the forefront of debate over recovered memory therapy, the most 
divisive issue to hit the mental health profession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Ramona, who Holly said repeatedly raped her between the ages of 5 and 8, 
has been "totally vindicated" by the decision, the father's attorney, Richard 
Harrington, said in an interview Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They found that the memories that Gary Ramona molested Holly Ramona were 
false," Harrington said. "F-A-L-S-E. False. And they found that these 
defendants were negligent, which they were." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose called the decision "a very strange verdict." Hospital representatives 
said they were not aware of the verdict.  
</P>
<P>
 But the jury did not award Gary Ramona the $8 million that he sought in 
damages and lost wages. Instead, the panel granted Ramona $250,000 for wages 
lost to date and $250,000 for future losses. When the incest allegations 
surfaced in 1990, Ramona lost his $400,000-a-year job as a vice president for 
worldwide marketing at Robert Mondavi Winery, and his family fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tremendous victory," Gary Ramona said Friday. "This verdict means 
that the jury saw what I've always known: that Holly's supposed memories are 
the result of defendants' drugs and quackery, not anything I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Ramona, who has since divorced her husband, has stood by her 
daughter and the therapists who treated her. "I don't think he should have 
gotten a penny for raping his own daughter," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Ramona's suspicions that she may have been molested surfaced in early 
1990, when she was receiving therapy for depression and bulimia while attending 
UC Irvine. She testified during the trial that the memories were triggered by a 
trip back home in 1989, a Christmas excursion during which her father looked at 
her in a sexual fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 During a shopping trip to Palm Springs with her mother and grandmother, Holly 
Ramona said in court, she had the first of several flashbacks, the image of her 
father's hand on her stomach. Later, she testified, she had a memory in which 
"I was on a bed, there was a lot of light and a white sheet. My father was on 
top of me. His penis was inside me." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to believe them," Ramona testified. But "I wouldn't be here if 
there was a question in my mind. My father molested me." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Ramona, and a cadre of expert witnesses who testified on his behalf 
during the nearly two-month trial, contended that Isabella implanted the 
memories in a vulnerable girl's mind and used the hypnotic drug sodium amytal 
to prove to her that the images were true. 
</P>
<P>
 While under the influence of the drug, which Rose administered, Holly Ramona 
recounted multiple episodes of abuse, although her descriptions were sketchy. 
Afterward, Isabella reportedly called the young woman's mother and said, "It's 
rape." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Park Elliott Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist hired by Gary Ramona, 
testified that Isabella's conclusion was an "outrageous misrepresentation" and 
that Isabella and Rose failed to follow standards for acceptable therapeutic 
care.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Dietz said the case was important because "while there's much in 
place to regulate the use of surgery and medication and electroshock and other 
powerful treatments, there has been little to constrain the use of 
psychotherapeutic techniques that are equally powerful." 
</P>
<P>
 "And this should at least give therapists pause before wreaking havoc with 
patients' minds or memory and the lives of all around them." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Gold, a licensed marriage and family counselor in the Santa Cruz area 
who has written on mental health issues, said he was not surprised by the 
verdict, which he characterized as a wake-up call for therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter for mental health professionals to look at the issues and find 
better ways of diagnosing and assessing childhood molestation," Gold said. "It 
opens up a big question. That's the importance of the case -- to re-evaluate 
our assessment tools and come up with better ways of handling those cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington, Gary Ramona's attorney, was more blunt in his view of the verdict: 
"It tells health care professionals that they're supposed to be properly 
trained and not tell lies to their patients about what medications can do and 
cannot do," he said. "Sodium amytal is not truth serum."

CLINTON PICKS MODERATE JUDGE BREYER FOR SUPREME COURT SPOT; JUDICIARY: 
PRESIDENT SAYS THE SCHOLARLY NOMINEE HAS 'PROVEN THAT HE CAN BUILD AN EFFECTIVE 
CONSENSUS.' THE FEDERAL JURIST HAS WIDE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE SENATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting candidates who appeared to be more controversial, President Clinton 
on Friday chose federal Judge Stephen G. Breyer, a scholarly centrist jurist 
with bipartisan support, to fill his Administration's second vacancy on the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hastily convened press conference, Clinton, absent the nominee who had 
been informed too late to be there, hailed the 55-year-old Boston jurist as a 
candidate of "excellence" with a keen mind, respect for civil rights and the 
ability to explain the law to average Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Breyer, who would replace retiring Justice Harry A. Blackmun if 
confirmed by the Senate, has "proven that he can build an effective consensus. 
. . . Without dispute, he is one of the outstanding jurists of our age." 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer has sat on the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston since 1980 
and was named chief judge in 1990. A runner-up in last year's Supreme Court 
search, Breyer earlier was chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee 
under Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Garden announcement ended a tortuous 37-day search in which Clinton 
apparently had been ready, in recent days, to choose Interior Secretary Bruce 
Babbitt or federal appeals Judge Richard S. Arnold of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton said he "couldn't afford to lose" Babbitt from his sensitive 
Cabinet post. And, he said, he could not risk choosing his old Arkansas friend 
until questions about his nearly two-decades-old cancer were resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 With enthusiastic support from Republicans, Breyer's nomination is likely to 
sail through the Senate confirmation proceedings, sparing Clinton any 
distracting controversy as his health reform bill wends its way through 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But the selection leaves Clinton vulnerable to criticism that he yielded to 
pressure from Senate conservatives who had expressed unhappiness at the 
prospect that the more liberal Babbitt could be chosen. Indeed, some aides had 
been pushing Clinton to choose Babbitt and prove that he would not allow the 
opposition of Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), ranking minority member of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, or other conservative Republicans to influence his 
Supreme Court choices. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement brought plaudits from conservatives and hesitation from some 
liberals. Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), for example, called Breyer an 
"excellent choice," and he drew praise as well from Hatch and Sen. Alan K. 
Simpson (R-Wyo.), both Judiciary Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio, a liberal Democrat, said that he had 
concerns about Breyer's "moderate to conservative" record. "He's been more 
concerned about the situation of big business" and less about that of smaller 
companies and the less well off, Metzenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, Breyer's chief advocate in the Senate, called the nomination 
"outstanding." And he added: "Judge Breyer is a brilliant legal scholar with a 
profound understanding of the law and its impact on the lives of real people." 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer is said to have given up a promising political career for a life on the 
bench. He has been described as skilled in forging consensus. As majority 
counsel to the Judiciary Committee, he won support from members of both 
political parties. Indeed, Breyer was confirmed to the federal court -- after 
the defeat for reelection in 1980 of President Jimmy Carter, who had nominated 
him -- because he had become so well-liked by committee conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers who have worked with him in New England praise him as quick, scholarly 
and nonpartisan, if a bit imperious. Financial disclosure forms show that he 
owns several million dollars in stocks and bonds. The Supreme Court annual 
salary is $164,100. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Breyer's legal credentials may be unassailable, he is not the 
nationally respected political figure that Clinton once said he wanted to 
appoint to ensure that social realities are represented on the court. Clinton's 
first choice last year for a previous court opening was New York Gov. Mario M. 
Cuomo, and this year he first sought Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.). Both men withdrew their names from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 With a scholarly manner that Georgetown University law professor Paul 
Rothstein called "almost egghead," Breyer probably also is not the person with 
a common touch and "big heart" that Clinton had said he was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer's selection is likely to disappoint minorities, in particular Latinos, 
who had been hopeful that one of their number might be chosen for the post. 
Federal Judge Jose A. Cabranes of Connecticut once was said to be a leading 
candidate but he was not among the final three, and some liberal advocates have 
complained that his name on short lists of prospects was "window dressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's finalists were all white males from Harvard, a fact that will make 
it far harder for the diversity-conscious Clinton to choose anyone but a 
minority if he receives a third opportunity to name a justice. Some court 
watchers believe that Justice John Paul Stevens may retire next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice of Breyer also may lead to criticism that Clinton had raised the 
expectations of other candidates. Such criticism was directed at Clinton last 
year when he passed over Breyer -- after a highly publicized Oval Office 
meeting -- in favor of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton seemed to be trying to prevent such comments by lavishly praising 
Babbitt and Arnold in his Rose Garden press conference. As a former governor, 
Babbitt would bring to the court "the responsibility and discipline of service 
in public life," and a feel "for life at the grass roots," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited Arnold's reputation, noting that 100 federal judges, a full eighth of 
the federal bench, had written him to endorse Arnold's character. And he said 
if he had another chance to select a Supreme Court justice, "I will consider 
Judge Arnold at the top of the list." 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton increasingly focused on the issue this week, aides said that he 
first leaned toward Babbitt, then toward Arnold but only on Friday -- within 
two hours of the announcement -- made up his mind to name Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Between Monday and Wednesday, Clinton came close to naming Babbitt and many 
White House aides were enthusiastic. But at a meeting in the White House 
residential quarters later it became clear that "the President wasn't there," 
said one aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides acknowledged that there was some concern that a Babbitt confirmation 
proceeding "wouldn't be completely clean." But they insisted the consideration 
was far less important than concerns that it would be hard to replace Babbitt 
at Interior, a post that Clinton considers key to his Western political 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The aide played down suggestions that the selection would draw criticism that 
Clinton was not willing to fight for what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Interior secretary had been ruled out, Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) 
McLarty took the President aside in a White House kitchen, and the pair decided 
to consider Arnold, an old friend and the President's "sentimental favorite." 
</P>
<P>
 But a review of the Senate revealed that the selection of Arnold would stir 
unhappiness among a number of women Democratic senators -- Dianne Feinstein and 
Barbara Boxer of California, Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland, Patty Murray of 
Washington and Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois. Some women's groups and 
abortion rights groups also opposed Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, according to aides, was the question of Arnold's cancer. On 
Thursday, McLarty asked for additional reports on the prognosis for the 
disease, for which Arnold is soon to receive additional treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision was made by the President at about 4 p.m. Friday, after he 
spent about half an hour reflecting by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Clinton met Breyer in the Oval Office, where, aides said later, the 
"chemistry" between them had been bad. But aides told Clinton this year that 
the problem may have been only that Breyer was too ill from a long railroad 
trip from Boston and a punctured lung he had suffered in a bicycle accident not 
long before, to give the meeting all of his concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 After the decision Friday, Clinton called Breyer, who was "thrilled," 
according to an aide. Clinton suggested that Breyer visit the White House with 
his wife this weekend, telling him that they could stay in the Lincoln Bedroom. 
Breyer is expected to attend a more formal Rose Garden ceremony with the 
President Monday. From Harvard to High Court Nominee 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen G. Breyer is a highly respected Boston jurist with a background in 
teaching. If confirmed, he will replace retiring Justice Harry A. Blackmun. 
Though Breyer is considered a moderate, it is unclear whether his opinions

PALIMONY JURY AWARDS $84 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY and RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a palimony award believed to be the largest ever made, an Orange County 
jury ruled Friday that flashlight mogul Anthony Maglica must pay $84 million to 
a woman he lived, worked and shared his name with for more than 20 years, but 
never married. 
</P>
<P>
 The Superior Court jury determined that Maglica, 64, and his former companion, 
Claire Maglica, 60, had no oral or written agreement to equally share earnings 
from a former machine shop the couple successfully turned into Mag Instrument 
Inc., the Ontario-based maker of the popular Mag-Lite flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
 But the jury found that Anthony Maglica, the company's president and sole 
shareholder, lied to Claire Maglica about providing for her financially and 
failed to pay her proper wages as the firm's executive vice president -- a 
position she still holds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're obviously gratified by what the jury did, and also puzzled by what they 
did not do. They didn't find an oral contract," said Claire's attorney, John W. 
Keker, who contended that Anthony Maglica owed his client $200 million -- half 
of the company's estimated worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Anthony Maglica quickly announced their intention to appeal the 
decision, terming it a grave injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdict, jurors said they decided on the $84 million award after 
what one called "hard, long conversations." But they declined to elaborate on 
their deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Maglica, who shook and appeared distraught even before the verdict was 
announced, declined to comment. Claire Maglica, looking frail from weight loss 
during the case, also left the courthouse without speaking, much to the chagrin 
of more than 25 reporters, photographers and camera operators jostling for 
interviews in a case that has gained nationwide attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Maglica's attorney, Dennis M. Wasser, said he believes the verdict was 
wrong because jurors decided the case as if California law recognized 
common-law marriage -- which it does not. They simply felt sorry for Claire 
Maglica, he said, and gave her the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a matter of a defendant having a lot of money, a lady who was 60 years 
old, and the jury thinking there is enough money to go around," Wasser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Staight, a family law attorney in Newport Beach, said that even if the 
jury's decision is upheld on appeal, it is unlikely to have a widespread impact 
because so few palimony cases come to court. 
</P>
<P>
 But Staight and Linda Chapin, a professor who specializes in contract and 
family law at the Fullerton campus of Western State University School of Law, 
said the case should send a very strong message to cohabiting couples: Get 
everything in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely risky to be relying on an oral agreement," Chapin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will come down to a 'he said, she said' situation," Staight said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the lawyers involved in the case, as well as legal experts who followed 
the proceedings, said they believe the award is the largest ever in a palimony 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict is the latest twist in the story of a couple who achieved 
rags-to-riches success, only to end up battling in court over a 
multimillion-dollar business. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire and Anthony Maglica shared the same Anaheim Hills home, and the same 
name, for more than 20 years. Working together, they transformed a humble 
machine shop into the maker of the lightweight Mag-Lite flashlights that have 
proved especially popular among police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple hobnobbed with Presidents Reagan and Bush, became generous patrons 
of the Republican Party and made headlines last year as they rescued a blind 
boy from Bosnia and brought him to California for medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Their relationship had become troubled, however. And last July, Claire Maglica 
filed a lawsuit seeking half the $400 million she says the flashlight company 
is worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial began in a Santa Ana courtroom more than six weeks ago. The tale of 
their anguished battle was broadcast live nationwide on Court TV, and network 
officials said the proceedings prompted hundreds of calls from viewers taking 
sides in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica testified that the couple had made a private commitment to 
share everything. Anthony Maglica asserted that he never promised Claire 
anything and that she had knowingly signed a property agreement stating that 
the company was his. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica told the jury that she and Anthony vowed repeatedly during 
their years together to live "out of one pocket." She said that commitment 
dated back to a weekend getaway to Palm Springs in May, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on those commitments, Claire Maglica said she trusted that everything 
they owned, they owned together, even though their many homes and all the stock 
of Mag Instrument was only in Anthony Maglica's name. She said that trust was 
shattered in January, 1992, when she caught him trying to transfer stock into 
the names of his four children from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Maglica said he was burned financially by divorce once, and vowed 
never again to loosen his grip on his assets, particularly his business. 
</P>
<P>
 He testified that in 1977, after actor Lee Marvin's onetime companion, 
Michelle Triola, won a large settlement in a landmark lawsuit in which the term 
palimony was coined, he and Claire signed an agreement vowing to always keep 
their property separate. He contends that Claire broke their agreement by 
setting up a joint bank account behind his back in 1989, and filed a 
countersuit that sought $385,000 back from her. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was one pocket," Wasser told jurors. "And that pocket was picked." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasser also dismissed the "alleged oral agreement" that Claire Maglica 
referred to as nothing but "pillow talk." 
</P>
<P>
 In its ruling, the jury rejected Anthony Maglica's claim for $385,000 and 
found that the written agreement he testified about was not legally binding 
because Claire Maglica may have been pressured to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial Claire Maglica's attorney, Keker, portrayed Anthony Maglica 
as an egotist and a liar who denied in depositions ever referring to Claire as 
his wife publicly, although myriad other accounts contradicted that assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense witnesses for Anthony Maglica told a different story. Wasser sought to 
depict Claire as a greedy big-spender who loved fine clothing and high-class 
hotels and worked far less than Anthony did at the company. He told the jury 
that she altered credit card statements at the company to rake in dramatically 
larger reimbursements than she was owed.  
</P>
<P>
 She also made $1.7 million in her years at Mag, an ample salary for the kind 
of work she did, a defense witness testified. Claire's attorneys countered that 
she made only $1 million, far less than they say she should have earned for the 
work she did over the years.

U.S. SECRETLY PUSHING HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA; ASIA: MISSION AIMS TO WIN 
CONCESSIONS BEFORE DEADLINE ON TRADE STATUS. MEANWHILE, BEIJING RELEASES A 
DISSIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN and RONE TEMPEST, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has launched a secret, intensive diplomatic 
campaign to get China to make more concessions on human rights in the final 
weeks before the U.S. deadline for deciding whether Beijing's trade privileges 
in this country should be renewed, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in Beijing, the Chinese government early today bowed to U.S. 
pressure by releasing Chen Ziming, the most prominent dissident still in jail 
from the 1989 democracy movement, for what it said were medical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Labeled a "black hand" by the Beijing government for his leadership role in 
the 1989 demonstrations in Tian An Men Square, Chen, 41, is said to be 
suffering from high blood pressure and a skin ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 But his release on bail today is the latest and most significant in a series 
of last-minute gestures by the Chinese government in an effort to avert 
restrictions on its "most favored nation" trading status with the United 
States, its biggest export market. 
</P>
<P>
 In hopes of squeezing more concessions from the Beijing regime, the 
Administration is now trying through secret negotiations to do what Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher was unable to do in Beijing last March: make the 
Chinese regime take seriously President Clinton's oft-repeated threats to curb 
China's trade benefits if it fails to take concrete steps to ease its 
repressive policies. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Administration officials have refused to confirm or deny 
reports that the President has dispatched a secret emissary to Beijing for 
talks with the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration must decide by June 3 whether to renew China's trade 
benefits, which permit Chinese goods to be exported to the United States with 
the same low tariffs enjoyed by most other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to have any comment on any diplomacy that is going on," White 
House spokesman Tom Ross said Friday. Defending the secrecy, a senior 
Administration official said, "We're in the delicate last stages of this thing, 
and there's a fierce desire not to say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Two senior officials from the Jimmy Carter Administration, White House 
National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and Michel Oksenberg, 
Brzezinski's China expert on the National Security Council, are scheduled to 
land Monday in Beijing to take part in what is officially described as a 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Brzezinski and Oksenberg were in charge of the 1978 negotiations leading up to 
the establishment of diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 In resorting to secret diplomacy with Beijing, the Administration is following 
essentially the same path taken by former President George Bush, whom Clinton 
criticized in the 1992 campaign for "coddling dictators" in China. 
</P>
<P>
 In the six months after China's bloody 1989 crackdown, Bush twice dispatched 
Brent Scowcroft, his national security adviser, and Deputy Secretary of State 
Lawrence S. Eagleburger on secret missions to Beijing. Winston Lord, now 
Clinton's assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific, then 
denounced Bush for sending "fawning emissaries" to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an executive order issued by Clinton a year ago, China was supposed to 
make "overall significant progress" on human rights by this June if it wanted 
to get its trade benefits renewed for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, human rights groups and several Administration officials have 
acknowledged that China has not yet made this progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the release of Chen, the Beijing regime over the last few months 
appeared to take several steps backward by rearresting dissidents who had been 
freed, such as leading democracy activist Wei Jingsheng. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen was sentenced to 13 years in prison in February, 1991, on charges of 
conspiring to subvert the government and engaging in counterrevolutionary 
propaganda and agitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen's career as a dissident began in 1976 when he denounced the government in 
a speech in Tian An Men Square for which he was briefly jailed. He founded the 
"Beijing Spring" journal in 1979 but was forced to close it under official 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Chen founded the Social and Economic Research Institute along with 
fellow intellectual Wang Juntao. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1989 democracy movement, Chen and Wang urged restraint and 
counseled against direct confrontation with the government. However, in its 
post-crackdown analysis of the Tian An Men Square events, Chen and Wang were 
described as the main ringleaders, or "black hands," behind the movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang, who suffered from hepatitis, was released April 23 and allowed to travel 
to the United States for medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen's release means that the two top figures in the democracy movement still 
in custody have been released on the eve of Clinton's decision on renewal of 
trading relations. The Chinese are hoping the gestures are enough for the 
Clinton Administration to de-link trade and human rights issues.  
</P>
<P>
 In launching a last-minute diplomatic demarche, the Administration's immediate 
goal is to see if it can win enough changes from Beijing to be able to claim 
that there has been "significant progress." Among the possibilities would be a 
series of releases of prominent dissidents, a promise to end the jamming of 
Voice of America broadcasts or some new agreement on talks with the Dalai Lama, 
the exiled Tibetan leader. 
</P>
<P>
 National Security Adviser Anthony Lake referred briefly to the new 
negotiations in a television interview Thursday when he acknowledged that after 
the Christopher trip, the Administration had decided to switch to quiet 
diplomacy with China. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way to work this through was to drain the venom out of that rhetoric 
(between China and the United States), which we have done over the last month 
or so, and to work it with them very hard and privately," Lake said.

 Confronted with the sudden appearance of a potentially key witness, 
investigators searching for suspects in last year's deadly Calabasas/Malibu 
fire scrambled Friday to determine whether they still have a case and arranged 
to meet the man for a re-enactment of the early moments of the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Blakeley, an Agoura Hills contractor who surfaced Thursday night in an 
interview with The Times, gave an account that appears to corroborate the 
version of events provided by two firefighters -- Steven R. Shelp, 29, and 
Nicholas A. Durepo, 24 -- who are under investigation for allegedly setting the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, authorities expressed confidence that Blakeley is the mysterious 
missing "plumber" pictured in a Times photo published in recent days. He 
emerged from obscurity to find himself instantly in demand. Sheriff's 
investigators, district attorney's officials, television and print reporters -- 
all wanted to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for movie stars," he told a crush of reporters outside his 
modest house after he drove up early Friday evening in a white GMC truck. "I'm 
kind of a simple guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Blakeley said he had not yet met with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 One top official, Los Angeles Fire Chief Donald O. Manning, said he hoped that 
information provided by Blakeley would lead to a quick resolution of the case, 
which has proved an embarrassment for his department because Shelp was admitted 
to the city's Fire Department Academy after the blaze and has since joined the 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am pleased that a witness that the sheriff's investigators had been looking 
for has been located," he said. "I think it's a cloud that certainly is hanging 
over the fire service in general and over LAFD in particular." 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly for the two suspects, Blakeley said he was passing by the area 
where the fire ignited Nov. 2 and stopped to try to put it out a few minutes 
before Shelp and Durepo pulled up behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he may be able to help investigators sort out another unanswered 
question. Sheriff's Department investigators have expressed doubts about some 
aspects of the account given by the suspects, including their contention that a 
passing plumber gave them a device to hook their garden hose to a nearby fire 
hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Without identifying the suspects by name, Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman 
Block has repeatedly cited the issue of the mysterious passing plumber and 
investigators' inability to locate him, suggesting that the suspects made up 
that detail in order to cover for the fact that they had brought the device 
along and had set the fire in order to then put it out and be hailed as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 In his interview with The Times, Blakeley said he provided the adapter for the 
fire hydrant, as Shelp and Durepo alleged. If Blakeley's statements hold up 
under scrutiny by investigators, they could bolster the versions provided by 
the two suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although investigators declined to comment on whether the latest disclosures 
would harm their case, a source in the district attorney's office said they 
appeared to represent a setback for Block and the Sheriff's Department. Block 
has publicly stated that he is convinced the department has identified the 
right suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assuming it's true, quite honestly it doesn't sound good for the sheriff's 
case," said the source, who asked to remain anonymous. "We don't have all the 
information that the Sheriff's Department has . . . but it doesn't sound good." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since news of the investigation surfaced last week, prosecutors and 
Sheriff's Department officials have privately accused each other of leaking 
information about the inquiry. Friday, the source in the district attorney's 
office reiterated that office's contention that the Sheriff's Department was 
responsible for last week's leaks, and said prosecutors believe it was done to 
pressure them into charging Shelp and Durepo with arson. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shouldn't have leaked it in the first place," the source said. "We 
assume that happened because we disagreed on how to proceed. And that really 
may be backfiring on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department officials declined to comment on the issue of the leaks 
and were more guarded in their assessment of the new witness's potential 
significance to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an individual who obviously is important to our investigation, and 
anything he says obviously will be quite important and quite significant," said 
Sheriff's Deputy Patrick Hauser, a spokesman for the department. "Obviously the 
potential (to exonerate the suspects) is there. We don't know exactly what this 
individual is going to say, but obviously it will have quite an important 
bearing on the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Blakeley came forward Thursday after The Times published a photograph of a man 
drinking from the hose at the scene, accompanied by an article noting that the 
suspects believed the man in the picture could confirm their version of events. 
Friends recognized the person in the photo as Blakeley, and told him that 
investigators were trying to locate him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our investigators are pretty sure" that Blakeley is the person in the 
photograph, Block said. "It was the photograph that caused him to come forward. 
Someone who saw the photo in the paper recognized it was him." 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources familiar with the probe, investigators have asked 
Blakeley not to grant additional interviews, frustrating a horde of reporters 
who gathered outside his home in Agoura Hills. More than a dozen reporters and 
camera crews staked out the block where Blakeley lives, hounding neighbors for 
interviews and hoping for an appearance by the suddenly famous contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators want Blakeley to lead them through a re-enactment of his actions 
on the day the fire broke out, and sources close to the probe said they expect 
that to happen within a few days. That re-enactment may help clear up exactly 
when Blakeley first saw Shelp and Durepo and what he saw them doing -- key 
issues in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In his interview with The Times, Blakeley said he was driving from Los Angeles 
International Airport to Agoura Hills when he saw the first signs of fire on a 
hillside above Old Topanga Canyon Road. Blakeley said he stopped, and three to 
five minutes later, two young men pulled up behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Blakeley, the two men were trying to battle the fire and had a 
garden hose in the back of their truck. They could not attach the hose to a 
nearby fire hydrant until Blakeley, who works in underground contracting, 
produced a special fixture. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two young fellows came up behind me," he said. "I happened to have the 
adapter." 
</P>
<P>
 Blakeley said he stayed at the scene for about 45 minutes. For that entire 
time, he said, Shelp and Durepo appeared to be helping. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting with reporters Friday morning, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti said he expects investigators from his office to question Blakeley as 
soon as it can be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti downplayed Blakeley's potential significance to the case, noting that 
investigators will not know how important he is until they have a chance to 
interview him. The significance of any statement Blakeley makes to authorities, 
Garcetti added, will be based on what he tells investigators and how that fits 
into what they know. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may turn out to be a very important witness," Garcetti said, "or he may 
turn out to be marginal." 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of Blakeley came as friends and firefighters from around the 
Southland have quietly been rallying to help Shelp and Durepo, saying they 
believe in their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the people coming forward, it's just unbelievable," said Chris Keenan, 
who supervised both men when they worked for the La Habra Heights volunteer 
Fire Department. According to Keenan, firefighters and others have offered 
moral support and, in some cases, money to help Shelp and Durepo cover their 
legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan said he and some of his firefighters have little to go on but their 
personal knowledge of the two. But he said they plan to be in the hallway of 
the courthouse next week when Shelp and Durepo are scheduled to appear before a 
grand jury to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Shelp nor Durepo was available for comment about the latest 
disclosures, but friends said they were relieved and pleased to learn that the 
man in the photograph had been identified and had come forward to bolster their 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are unbelievably excited about this," one friend of Durepo said. "They 
say this shows that everything they said was true." 
</P>
<P>
 When another friend told Shelp that Blakeley had come forward, he said Shelp 
responded: "I told you so."

MAJOR POWERS AGREE ON TERMS FOR BOSNIA PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States, Russia and the European Union on Friday launched a new 
effort to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, calling on the factions there to 
agree to a four-month cease-fire and a 51%-49% split of the republic's 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting out for the first time an agreed-on statement of the peace terms they 
will seek, the big powers also said they will begin lifting U.N. economic 
sanctions on Serbia, the Bosnian Serbs' chief ally, once a Bosnian settlement 
is being implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, speaking after a six-hour meeting with 
the foreign ministers of Russia and five Western European countries, said the 
governments are all determined "to try to put this awful war to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said they were summoning Bosnian Serb, Croatian and Muslim 
negotiators to talks within two weeks to begin working on details of a 
cease-fire and a new round of peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement -- signed by the United States, Russia, Britain, France, 
Germany, Belgium, Greece and the European Union -- marked the first time in 
more than two years of attempts to end the Bosnian war that the major powers 
have agreed on so detailed a framework for a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But after two years of diplomatic failures, both American and European 
officials concluded that they could only succeed if they buried their 
differences -- and brought in Russia, which has acted as a great-power 
protector of its longtime allies, the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said, "there (have been) 
divisions . . . among those who have been seeking to achieve a negotiated peace 
-- divisions across the Atlantic between Europe and the United States, 
divisions between the West and Russia, divisions between NATO and the U.N. The 
main purpose of this meeting has been to create and sustain a united 
diplomacy." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, the foreign ministers produced a three-page statement that 
emphasized their determination to convene peace talks, spelled out basic terms 
for a settlement, artfully glossed over some of the issues that have divided 
them in the past and did not say what they would do if any of the Bosnian 
factions failed to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Their statement calls for a settlement that divides Bosnia into two republics 
-- one Serbian, one a Muslim-Croatian federation -- with an undefined 
constitutional link. It would give the Bosnian Serbs 49% of the republic, 
leaving 51% for the Muslims and Croats. The Bosnian Serbs now hold about 70% of 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia for the first time endorsed those percentages, which Bosnian Serbs have 
rejected, diplomats said. The Muslims and Croats have accepted the 51% figure, 
although they have said they believe that they are entitled to more and have 
been negotiating over which land they should receive. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer to begin lifting sanctions on Serbia once a peace agreement is in 
effect was an apparent concession by the United States, which had earlier 
resisted holding out such a carrot to Belgrade without more conditions. Russia 
and some European governments had argued that offering to lift some sanctions 
as soon as a peace agreement was signed would induce the Serbs to be more 
flexible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good-faith implementation of a peace settlement that includes provisions for 
withdrawal to agreed territorial limits will lead to phased suspension of the 
sanctions," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev praised the statement's "clear link 
between the peace process and a removal of sanctions," and he suggested that it 
would appeal to the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior American official said the Clinton Administration had not changed its 
harder-line position of demanding significant territorial withdrawals and 
cooperation with war crimes tribunals before the sanctions could be lifted. But 
he acknowledged that those conditions were left out of Friday's statement -- to 
ensure that agreement could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher and the other foreign ministers said they do not know whether 
their new approach will work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not succeed," Hurd said. "But we all felt that we had to make that 
effort . . . because the prospects for the future are dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said he believes that the Bosnian Serbs and other factions will 
come to the new peace talks. "We think that they must recognize, as does the 
entire world, the need for a negotiated settlement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate reaction from the Bosnian Serbs or the Muslim-led 
government. But American officials said they had already outlined the allied 
plan to the Sarajevo government, which approved. A senior U.S. official said 
that if the parties respond, a formal "cessation of hostilities," including a 
cease-fire and withdrawal of forces from the front lines, could be in place 
within six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign ministers called for a four-month cessation of hostilities because 
the Bosnian government feared that a permanent cease-fire would freeze the 
territorial lines where they are, in effect giving the Serbs control over the 
70% of Bosnia they hold. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims don't cooperate, French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe warned, his country may pull out of the U.N. peacekeeping force in 
Bosnia -- a move that could cause the entire force to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the Bosnian Serbs don't respond, Christopher said, the Administration 
will feel more pressure from Congress to lift the U.N. arms embargo against 
Bosnia. The Senate passed a resolution Thursday giving President Clinton a 
mixed message about breaking the embargo, a step Clinton has refused to take.

STATE HOLDS FIRM ON DEADLINE FOR ELECTRIC CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE and MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Air Resources Board on Friday unequivocally upheld its 
revolutionary mandate requiring the auto industry to sell electric cars in the 
state beginning in 1998, despite intense lobbying by major U.S. and Japanese 
automobile manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision on whether California would go forward with its requirement to 
mass-produce the cars had been awaited by thousands of giant industries and 
small entrepreneurial businesses worldwide, from General Motors and Toyota to 
Southern California Edison and Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The mandate) must remain in place," board Chairwoman Jacqueline Schafer said 
at the conclusion of the two-day hearing. "There is no doubt that tremendous 
advancements have occurred since we adopted the (electric car) regulation in 
1990. . . . I don't think we want to take any actions that will slow down or 
stall this progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1998, 2% of vehicles sold each year in California by major 
manufacturers -- an estimated 25,000 cars -- must be exhaust-free under the new 
standard. In 2001, the sales quota will increase to 5% and in 2003 to 10%. The 
board has the authority to prevent companies that fail to comply from selling 
any cars in the lucrative California market. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, meeting in Los Angeles, concluded its marathon review after about 
24 hours of public debate over two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the standard, adopted in 1990, survived this week's crucial review, it 
is expected to encourage multimillion-dollar investments, especially in 
California, as auto makers, utilities, battery producers and others gear up for 
production. Although another review is scheduled for 1996, auto manufacturers 
say they soon must begin design of the 1998 models and pilot production of 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is an electric vehicle revolution clearly is being born," 
said Malcolm Currie, chief executive officer emeritus of Hughes Aircraft and 
head of Project California, a statewide group of business leaders trying to 
foster new industries. "This is a blueprint for environmental and economic 
revitalization of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Most observers had predicted that the mandate would remain intact. But 
Friday's reaffirmation by the board was a relief to California business 
leaders, environmentalists and other supporters who feared that the board might 
give in to pressure and roll the deadline back. The powerful lobby opposed to 
it and several newly appointed board members gave the issue an element of 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Schafer, appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson in January, said she was impressed by 
the rapid improvement in batteries and other technology for electric cars. She 
said, however, that the hearings revealed other challenging issues, such as the 
marketability of the cars and the need for recharging stations and other 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of work to be done still to bring this about, but I expect 
that if we follow this course we will meet and exceed our own expectations and 
those of the car-buying public," Schafer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Air quality officials say California would never achieve healthful air without 
the mandate. Even when considering the extra emissions from power plants, 
electric cars are more than 90% cleaner than gasoline-powered cars, the board 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 When car manufacturers realized there was little support for delaying the 
deadlines, they tried to persuade the board to conduct another review in six 
months. But the board rejected that request after hearing numerous business and 
government officials say the uncertainty would stall investments in the 
electric car industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Schafer said the board will hold routine evaluations of the mandate 
"if new and compelling information becomes available." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) who heads the Assembly's Transportation 
Committee, had warned that "investments would dry up or leave the state if the 
rule is changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz and several others said the opposition from the auto industry was driven 
more by fear that jobs will move from Detroit to California than by concern 
over technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The mandate is revolutionary because it does not simply set an emissions 
target such as in the past but establishes a sales quota. Each major 
manufacturer -- GM, Ford, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Mazda -- must 
sell 1,000 to 7,000 electric cars in the first year. The board believes that 
mandating sales is the only way to spur large investment by the auto industry 
and slowly wean drivers from gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 In fighting the mandate, auto makers emphasized that there will be few buyers 
and downplayed the efficiency of their electric cars. Although they said the 
technology has improved in recent years, they contended that it will not 
progress far enough to mass-produce practical cars by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's batteries require recharging within 100 miles, a range the auto 
industry calls insufficient to generate sales to meet the mandate. They said 
more efficient batteries, costing $30,000 to $40,000 each, are only in 
prototype form and cannot be ready in large volumes at a reasonable cost of 
under $5,000 until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll find a way to comply with the mandate but it won't be the way any of us 
want," Peter Pestillo, a Ford Motor Co. executive, told the board. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board's staff said its research shows at least one pilot plant in 1995 
will be producing advanced battery technology that can offer a range of 200 
miles between charges.  
</P>
<P>
 Battery and fuel cell manufacturers and utility executives also argued that 
the technologies were closer at hand than auto makers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Some battery makers described tests in which vehicles traveled well over 200 
miles on a single charge -- twice the current performance of most lead-acid 
batteries. Many manufacturers also predicted that costs of the advanced 
batteries would decline sharply, comparable to what occurred with other new 
technologies, from microwaves to compact disc players. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Utility officials said that despite serious challenges, they could be ready in 
1998 with recharging stations, plugs in public parking areas and other 
infrastructure needed to support electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power 
have pledged to install a home electric charging connection within 72 hours of 
a customer buying an electric car. 
</P>
<P>
 If customers do most of their charging at night, when utilities have unused 
generating capacity, Edison could charge more than 1 million electric cars 
without new power sources, said Diane O. Wittenberg, Edison's manager of 
electric transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect that the average (electric car) will use as many kilowatt hours 
each year as a small house," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, in an unexpected disclosure, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said it plans to 
begin testing an as-yet-unidentified Japanese electric vehicle.  
</P>
<P>
 Studies funded by the Big Three auto companies contend that the first 
generation of electric cars will cost as much as $21,000 more than gasoline 
equivalents. The board has estimated that electric cars initially would cost 
$3,000 to $4,000 more.

COLUMN ONE; LEARNING A COSTLY LESSON ON COMPUTERS; WILL MULTIMEDIA SAVE OUR

BILLION-DOLLAR BAND-AID UNLESS WE RETHINK THE WAY WE TEACH.

 "I believe that ( it ) is destined to revolutionize our educational system and 
that in a few years it will supplant largely, if not entirely, the use of 
textbooks."  
</P>
<P>
 What is this wondrous technology, and who is the visionary making this bold 
prediction? Bill Gates touting the power of the personal computer? 
</P>
<P>
 No, it was Thomas Edison, 70 years ago, talking about the motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, the blackboard was supposed to turn education upside down. Today, 
multimedia computers and telecommunications are supposed to be the silver 
bullets that will fix the myriad problems that plague the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But America's love of technological solutions often has ended in heartbreak. 
And history may repeat itself with the euphoria over computers and education -- 
a fixation driven as much by the electronics industry's search for profit as 
any sign that PCs can turn around student performance. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't that technology has no place in the classroom. Most educators believe 
that computers and other Information Age wonders can be powerful teaching 
tools. In the right hands, they inspire the brightest students as they provide 
new ways to reach those with learning problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as the corporate world discovered that technology did not unleash 
productivity until companies undertook the hard work of changing the way they 
did business, experts say the billions of dollars a year that schools spend on 
computers will yield disappointment unless educators change the way they teach. 
</P>
<P>
 Which computer equipment to buy, how much to spend on it and how to use the 
technology are issues that cannot be severed from the national debate over 
school reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology alone will never do it -- not without a serious incorporation into 
how (teachers and school administrators) do their jobs," said Jan Hawkins, 
director of the Center for Children and Technology in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, such caveats have not slowed the flow of education dollars into high 
technology. The nation's public and private schools last year invested $2.1 
billion in personal computer technology, according to a study by the Software 
Publishers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say that number needs to be higher for schools to be properly equipped. 
Nearly all schools now have some computers, but on average there is only one 
for every 14 students, according to Quality Educational Data, a Denver research 
firm. And California ranks 49th among the states, at one computer for every 
19.8 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at that level, investment in computers competes with spending on teacher 
pay, books and paper as many schools face financial crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies whose main talent is selling products to schools -- notably Jostens 
Corp., originally known for peddling class rings and high school yearbooks -- 
have been quick to capitalize on the educational technology craze. 
Entertainment firms are muscling in as well. Trip Hawkins, chairman of 3DO Co., 
once declared his firm's advanced video game machine to be nothing less than 
"the greatest breakthrough in education since the invention of the printing 
press." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, schools are leaping aboard the bandwagon. From the elite 
Dalton School in Manhattan, with its state-of-the-art computer network and 
in-house software specialists, to scruffy Martin Luther King Elementary School 
in Oakland, with its shiny new, federally funded "integrated learning system," 
schools are racing to install new technology before parents accuse them of 
falling behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is little evidence that computers in themselves lead to sustained 
improvement in educational performance. American students continue to lag 
behind counterparts in Japan and Europe, where the computerization of education 
is far less advanced. Most studies suggest that a range of factors -- 
especially teacher competence -- ultimately will determine the effectiveness of 
computers in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 For veteran educators, today's enthusiasm for computers provokes an 
uncomfortable sense of deja vu ; they have seen too many technical fixes. In 
the 1960s and early 1970s, so-called "performance contracting" -- in which 
corporate management techniques and early educational computer systems were 
applied to the performance of underachieving students -- was all the rage. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the winding down of the military budget ( at the end of the Vietnam War 
) , a lot of companies looked to education as a big market," said David Tyack, 
a Stanford University professor who writes about such educational experiments. 
"There was an ideology: Business can solve any problem; we can guarantee how 
much kids will learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot programs were set up nationwide, with one of the most prominent 
experiments in Texarkana, Ark. A company called Dorsett Educational Systems set 
up a series of "rapid learning centers" where students logged into a 
centralized computer to practice basic math and language skills, Tyack recounts 
in a paper on the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Prizes were awarded for correctly finishing a programmed lesson or for 
advancing a grade level in mathematics or reading. But the experiment fell 
apart when it turned out that the Dorsett computers were giving students the 
answers to the standardized tests that were supposed to measure the program's 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Performance contracting quickly fell out of favor. But computers returned in 
other guises. A brief enthusiasm for "computer literacy" had high school and 
college students learning arcane -- and now almost useless -- computer 
programming languages. The first wave of microcomputers in the early 1980s 
spurred hopes again. 
</P>
<P>
 But many schools, especially poorer ones, ended up with obsolete equipment and 
lacked the software and teacher training to make good use of what they had -- a 
phenomenon detailed in a special fall, 1992, issue of the trade magazine 
Macworld, which warned of the creation of a "technological underclass" in 
America's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Multimedia -- the latest fad in the computer world -- is supposed to change 
all this, finally allowing computers to live up to their educational potential. 
By mixing sounds, pictures and video images with traditional text-based 
computers, multimedia systems seem to engage children growing up in a culture 
of video games and MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technology allows them to absorb things with much more vigor," said Chris 
Henmann, a science teacher at John F. Kennedy Jr. High School in Cupertino, a 
district that is part of California's model technology schools program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are naturally curious, natural investigators, and this allows them to 
nurture that," he said, gesturing to his multimedia teaching station that 
features a computer and a laser disc player for high-quality, interactive 
video. "They go at it with such passion." 
</P>
<P>
 Hungry for the emerging market, the software and entertainment industries are 
spending hundreds of millions on multimedia programs. Affluent parents -- 
fearful their kids will be left behind -- are the most avid customers. Sales of 
educational software for the home leaped a remarkable 73% in the fourth quarter 
of 1993, making it the hottest niche in the software business. 
</P>
<P>
 Although video game-like "edutainment" programs may be more edifying than the 
TV watching they are supplanting at home, computer-based learning in the 
schools displaces other kinds of teaching -- not always for reasons of 
educational effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal financial aid programs encourage school districts with limited 
resources to buy integrated learning systems -- self-contained computer labs 
that focus on drilling basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Descended from the mainframe computer-based "computer-aided instruction" 
systems of the 1970s, ILSs are a little bit like electronic workbooks that can 
adapt themselves to students' responses. A wrong answer to a question brings an 
explanation, and the next question will be of similar difficulty. With correct 
answers, the questions get progressively harder. The computer tracks the 
students' progress, allowing them to pick up where they left off after each 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading ILS companies -- Jostens Learning Corp. of San Diego and Computer 
Curriculum Corp., a Palo Alto-based subsidiary of Paramount Communications -- 
have been expanding their systems' capabilities to include multimedia, 
providing visual and sound cues along with words. Many now can be integrated 
with other types of software, such as electronic encyclopedias. 
</P>
<P>
 But often, these systems' appeal lies in the fact that they provide a simple 
solution for a troubled school, paid for by the federal government. The 
companies employ legions of former teachers and administrators who wine and 
dine school officials -- and coach them on how to find money for computer 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the U.S. Department of Education's Chapter I program, schools in poor 
neighborhoods can qualify for special funds to help underachieving students -- 
$6.9 billion for this fiscal year. An estimated 5% to 10% of the funds, which 
are administered by state and local school authorities, are spent on computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some evidence indicates that ILSs help improve test scores in the short term, 
and for years they have been accepted in many quarters as a worthwhile way to 
spend Chapter I funds. Just as important, they do not require the expensive 
teacher training, curriculum overhaul and sophisticated assessment methods that 
experts call critical to making the most of computers in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chapter I programs use ILSs because they have a lot of money to spend at 
once," said John Cradler, director of the Far West Laboratory for Educational 
Research and Development in San Francisco, which evaluates programs for the 
California Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ralph Bunche Jr. High School in Harlem, computer education specialist Paul 
Reese is familiar with the problem. The "school within a school" that he helps 
run is recognized as a technology innovator -- a place where computers, teacher 
training and curriculum reform come together. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when money became available for new machines, Reese was not able to spend 
it the way he wanted. The terms of a special grant from New York's Municipal 
Assistance Corp. required the school to buy an integrated learning system. 
</P>
<P>
 ILS companies reject the criticisms, pointing out that their systems, based 
these days on personal computers, are far more versatile than before. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technology now is so flexible that it's appropriate for all of our 
youngsters," said Proctor Houston, executive vice president of Jostens Learning 
Corp. "In our experience, the key to successful technology use is how it is 
implemented." 
</P>
<P>
 But implementation is the heart of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in large, urban school districts, teacher training is inadequate. 
Technology programs are only sporadically coordinated with larger reform 
efforts. Too often, the computer lab is an island. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is an enormous problem with assessment -- an extremely contentious 
subject in the schools even when computers are not involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Many educators say technology underscores the need for assessment methods 
deeper and more revealing than standardized testing, which is under increasing 
attack as outdated and racially and culturally biased. 
</P>
<P>
 There is growing support for so-called project-based learning -- in which 
computers can play a central role -- yet there is no cost-effective method to 
evaluate such techniques. That gap can make it all but impossible to determine 
how money should be spent: More computers, or more teacher training? More 
machines, or more high-level multimedia software?  
</P>
<P>
 "Technology is a tool, which in the hands of a good teacher can be very 
powerful. Kids are very attracted to it," said Marilyn Rosenblum, vice 
president for educational sales and marketing at Broderbund Software, a leading 
vendor of children's software.  
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not the solution to the ills of our schools," she added. "I'm scared 
that all the media hype and all the Wall Street hype is going to set us up for 
a big disappointment."

 NOT UNUSUAL: Some opponents immediately dismissed the idea, brought up by 
Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), of using the paddle to punish juvenile 
graffiti vandals. It's cruel and unusual, they say. . . . But from a legal 
standpoint, says David Gurnick, head of the San Fernando Valley Bar Assn., 
"It's debatable whether it's cruel, and it's certainly not unusual. We've had 
it in my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 OFF BROADWAY: Almost four months since the Jan. 17 quake, four Valley Broadway 
stores have yet to reopen. But there is hope. A spokeswoman says the Panorama 
City store will open next week, the Woodland Hills store by mid-June, and 
Sherman Oaks by July. . . . It'll be November before the Northridge Fashion 
Center store opens. Meanwhile, a survey of area stores shows most are making a 
strong comeback from the quake (D1). 
</P>
<P>
 MY WAY: Ever wish you could write your own epitaph? Well, one Valley priest 
actually has, and he also has his gravestone already in place. So what if he's 
still alive? . . . He's Msgr. Francis J. Weber (above), who celebrates Mass at 
the San Fernando Mission. The grave marker reads: "Born 1933, Ordained 1959. 
Priest-Archivist-Historian" (B15).

<P>
 ALL IN THE FAMILY: Sgt. J.J. Thompson, watch commander at the Devonshire 
Division, retires today after 31 years, but he'll never forget his last week. 
He went on patrol with his son, Dan, of the Rampart Division. They even made an 
arrest, recovering guns from an apartment. . . . "Dan handled himself well," 
his father said. "He took the lead right away." 
</P>
<P>
 BIG BOY: At first, Philip MacDonald showed little nostalgia. As owner of Bob's 
Big Boy in Burbank, the oldest in the country, he wanted to convert the site to 
retail or office space. . . . But he ended up spending at least $50,000 to 
restore it to its 1949 condition. And this week, he was honored by the Burbank 
Historical Society for his efforts (B2). Michael Arkush

DEMOCRACY; THAI PROTESTER WHO HELPED FELL JUNTA AIMS AT CIVILIAN PREMIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In May, 1992, a hunger strike by Chalad Vorachat against military rule started 
a chain reaction of street protests that led to the collapse of a government 
headed by a retired army chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Chalad announced he was going to resume his fast to the death. This 
time his target was not the influence of Thailand's powerful military but 
civilian Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, who came to power on a wave of popular 
support for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chalad's protest was perhaps the most graphic sign so far of popular 
disenchantment with democratic government two years after as many as 100 people 
were killed in clashes with the army during demonstrations demanding elected, 
civilian rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, among the most vocal critics of the government now are the same 
newly affluent business people whose support for democratic reforms was 
instrumental in bringing down the government of Suchinda Kraprayoon two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people in the middle class are disillusioned," said Amarr Siamwalla, 
head of the Thailand Development Research Institute, a Bangkok think tank. "The 
government hasn't accomplished an awful lot. They appear to be just bumbling 
along." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuan, who took office at the head of a five-party coalition in September, 
1992, does get high marks from many analysts for trying to decentralize the 
economy and for keeping his government relatively corruption-free, no small 
accomplishment compared to the rapaciousness of past Thai governments. But 
Chuan is widely criticized for appearing paralyzed by indecision in the face of 
pressing problems such as Bangkok's notorious traffic gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuan is too cautious. He needs to be more assertive," said Suchit 
Bunbangkong, a respected political analyst at Chulalongkorn University. 
</P>
<P>
 A frustrated Chuan complained after a particularly bruising defeat in 
Parliament that "it is difficult for an elected administration to please 
everyone. The work is even more difficult when the government is trying to do 
its job and uphold democratic and legal principles at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem came to a head at the end of March when the ruling coalition 
called a special session of Parliament to consider 25 changes designed to 
liberalize the constitution that was drafted under a military junta in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the proposed changes was an amendment designed to reduce the power of 
the Senate, the upper house of Parliament that is filled with former military 
men and senior civil servants who were appointed by the previous administration 
rather than elected. The Senate, rebelling at the prospect of having its 
perquisites cut back, joined with opposition members of the lower house of 
Parliament and voted against the proposed democratic reforms. Instead, they 
adopted an entirely different constitution that was literally cut and pasted 
together from past charters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nation newspaper, one of the loudest proponents of democracy in Thailand, 
called the maneuver a "quiet, sinister coup in broad daylight." The opposition 
demanded that Chuan dissolve Parliament and call new elections, a demand he has 
so far ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 The political crisis is far from over. A second reading of the proposed new 
constitution is coming up in two months, and the same coalition of opposition 
parties and disaffected senators appears ready to override the government and 
pass its own version. If it does, Chuan may have little choice but to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuan's government won a brief reprieve from the barrage of criticism thanks 
to a timely announcement from Washington. The U.S. government disclosed Tuesday 
that it had seized a luxurious Beverly Hills home and Mercedes-Benz belonging 
to Thanong Siriprechapong, a member of Parliament for the opposition Chart Thai 
party, on charges they had been purchased with the proceeds of millions of 
dollars in marijuana sales in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 While Thanong initially denied the allegations, the charges helped to revive 
memories of corruption in Chart Thai, which also had close ties to past 
military rulers. Compared to drug dealers in Parliament, Thai political 
analysts mused, perhaps Chuan did not look so bad after all.

PEACEKEEPING; U.N. LOOKS TO CELEBRATIONS OF ITS FIRST 50 YEARS; OFFICIALS 
PONDER THE WORLD BODY'S FUTURE AT A GATHERING TO COMMEMORATE THE CONFERENCE 
THAT LED TO ITS BIRTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Almost like history repeating itself, American officials handed out documents 
to delegates recently in elegant, secluded Dumbarton Oaks, setting down the 
U.S. government's ideas for dealing with disorder in a strange new world. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a century ago, in the wartime summer of 1944, Secretary of State Cordell 
Hull called delegates from Britain, the Soviet Union and China to Dumbarton 
Oaks to discuss U.S. proposals for a new international organization to police 
the world. That conference led to the creation of the United Nations a year 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 To commemorate the 50th anniversary, the trustees of Harvard University, who 
own Dumbarton Oaks, convened scholars, diplomats and officials last weekend in 
the famous 19th-Century mansion to discuss the creation, achievements, failures 
and future of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference was also a prelude to myriad events that will celebrate the 
50th anniversary of the United Nations next year, culminating on Oct. 24, 1995, 
when chiefs of state and government will flock to New York to mark the day that 
the world organization officially came to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The anniversary year will also feature a gathering of Nobel Peace Prize 
laureates in San Francisco, where delegates from 50 nations signed the U.N. 
Charter on June 26, 1945; a world tour by London's Royal Philharmonic 
Orchestra, special stamp issues, and a host of publications and conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the future celebrations, however, is likely to have the special, 
shadowed charm of Dumbarton Oaks. The mansion, with its collection of art and 
10 acres of sculpted gardens on a hill in Washington's wealthy Georgetown 
neighborhood, was donated to Harvard by retired U.S. Ambassador Robert Woods 
Bliss in 1940. The State Department borrowed the site for the momentous 
conference four years later. 
</P>
<P>
 The anniversary meetings came just a few days after President Clinton signed 
Presidential Decision Directive 25 -- a skeptical U.S. assessment of U.N. 
peacekeeping missions in the post-Cold War era and the limited role that the 
United States envisions for itself in such operations. U.S. officials took 
advantage of the timing to pass out detailed explanations of the directive to 
the conferees. 
</P>
<P>
 The skepticism struck an ironic note, because no one was as enthusiastic about 
multilateral policing of aggression and turmoil as the U.S. delegates to 
Dumbarton Oaks 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's Michael Howard, president of the International Institute for 
Strategic Studies and a retired Yale University historian, said the 1941 
Atlantic Charter signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime 
Minister Winston Churchill first raised the idea of a future system of 
collective security. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now this vision of the postwar world was quintessentially American," Howard 
told the delegates last weekend. "The British disliked some of it and were 
skeptical about most of it, but for them the important thing was to get the 
Americans on board, first as allies in fighting the war and then as associates 
in keeping the peace." 
</P>
<P>
 The original Dumbarton Oaks conference, while fashioning most of the future 
United Nations, ended in disagreement on two points -- a veto for the permanent 
members of the Security Council and the number of seats that the republics of 
the Soviet Union could have in the General Assembly. At Yalta later, Josef 
Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt finally agreed to allow a veto and grant seats 
to three Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
 But many speakers looked forward last week rather than back. Assistant 
Secretary of State Douglas J. Bennet had an admonition for those who believe 
that the United Nations is about to fulfill many of the hopes set down for it 
at the first Dumbarton Oaks conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fiftieth anniversaries invite celebration," Bennet said. "But let us not 
celebrate an illusion that the Dumbarton Oaks institutions . . . will 
spontaneously regenerate and start serving mankind as the founders intended. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a fresh interpretation of the forces driving today's world and 
without a fresh infusion of vision and commitment, the Dumbarton Oaks 
institutions may be overwhelmed by forces already loose in the world."

FALWELL SELLING TAPE THAT ATTACKS CLINTON; POLITICS: ACCUSATIONS INCLUDE ONE 
THAT ALLEGES COMPLICITY BY THE PRESIDENT IN 'COUNTLESS' MURDERS. THE CHARGE IS 
UNSUPPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Evangelist Jerry Falwell has begun marketing a $43 videotape featuring an 
assortment of allegations involving President Clinton ranging from sexual 
misconduct to murder, in the most visible venture to date by conservative 
critics circulating damaging anti-Clinton material. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape, being promoted on television and in conservative publications, runs 
nearly two hours and highlights Larry Nichols, a former state employee in 
Little Rock and an avowed enemy of Clinton, accusing the President of vague 
complicity in the murders of "countless people." 
</P>
<P>
 By repeating those unsupported charges and many others, the tape seeks to 
propel them beyond the right-wing newsletters, tabloid newspapers and 
conservative radio talk shows that have traded in such allegations and rumors 
since the start of the Clinton presidency -- often in efforts to fuel doubts 
about his character and ultimately undermine his public policy agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Sold by mail through Liberty College in Lynchburg, Va., which was founded by 
Falwell, the tape also features press conference statements by Gennifer Flowers 
and Paula Corbin Jones, who have alleged sexual improprieties on the part of 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 presidential election campaign, Flowers alleged that she had 
had a lengthy affair with Clinton while he was governor and Jones recently 
filed a sexual-harassment lawsuit alleging that she had rebuffed Clinton's 
attempt in 1991 to engage her in oral sex. The President has denied both 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Falwell defended the tape sales this week in a television appearance, 
insisting that he was making no judgment on the veracity of the charges. He 
said that he was disseminating the allegations because "the national media 
should have been doing (it) and has been hypocritically quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're simply saying these charges are being made. Look at them and determine 
what is true," Falwell said on CNN's "Crossfire" show. "I am making no charges 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the allegations have been thoroughly investigated by the mainstream 
press, while others largely have been dismissed as innuendo fed by an 
assortment of people ranging from Clinton opponents to conspiracy theorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols, who was used by many reporters as a tipster during the 1992 campaign 
but seldom was quoted himself, is shown on Falwell's videotape speaking about 
mysterious deaths he attributes to Clinton but does not explain. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are dead in Arkansas," Nichols says at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started this I knew that I might be one of the unsolved mysteries in 
Arkansas. There were boys on a railroad track. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were countless and countless people that mysteriously died that as it 
turned out had some connection to Bill Clinton. I believe this is going on 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Falwell, asked by an interviewer if he was accusing Clinton of murder, 
responded: "No, we are not. We're saying -- we're repeating the evidence that 
is being put forth by others." 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape also includes allegations by Nichols that First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton has committed sexual improprieties. Falwell, repeating that he 
has no independent evidence to support such claims, said the purpose of the 
tape is to feature "the testimonies, the views of the Arkansas people who are 
saying these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Falwell's office said it had no immediate information on how many videotapes 
have been sold or how the proceeds are being used. But they said the $43 
purchase price is "a donation" that includes shipping costs.

ARKANSAS TROOPER'S EX-WIFE APPARENT SUICIDE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ex-wife of a state trooper who is a co-defendant in a sexual harassment 
lawsuit against President Clinton died in an apparent suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Ferguson, 37, was found dead of a gunshot wound to the right temple 
early Wednesday at the home of her boyfriend, said Mark Malcolm, chief deputy 
coroner for Pulaski County. 
</P>
<P>
 Her death was being investigated as a suicide, said Ray Snider, a police 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 A note apparently written by Ferguson was found near her body. It indicated 
problems in her relationship with her boyfriend, Sherwood Police Officer Bill 
Shelton, Malcolm said. Another note, apparently from Shelton to Ferguson, 
questioned her relationship with another man, Malcolm said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no known connection between her death and her ex-husband. Trooper 
Danny Ferguson said the two had been divorced for about four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Ferguson is named in a lawsuit by Paula Corbin Jones, a former state 
employee who alleges that then-Gov. Bill Clinton made unwanted sexual advances 
to her in 1991. Her lawsuit said the trooper invited her to the meeting with 
Clinton. The White House said there was no sexual harassment.

LEFTOVER LAND MINES POSE HUGE RISK; EMERGING NATIONS: WORLD LEADERS CALL FOR 
BAN ON PRODUCTION AND USE. THE U.N. CONTINUES ITS FORMIDABLE CLEANUP TASK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About 100 million unexploded land mines -- deadly reminders of past and 
present wars -- threaten economic growth in developing countries as well as the 
lives of innocent civilians, according to testimony Friday at a Senate hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Jimmy Carter, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
and world leaders sent written statements calling for a ban on production and 
use of the devices while the United Nations continues the slow, dangerous task 
of clearing mine fields in more than 60 nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), presiding at the first congressional hearing on 
the topic, said at least 1,200 people every month are killed or maimed by mines 
that he said "lie patiently in ambush for years upon years." 
</P>
<P>
 Only U.S. leadership and international cooperation, Leahy contended, can deal 
with a global crisis created by widespread use of mines as a weapon to 
terrorize civilians, as well as inflict casualties on enemy troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas E. McNamara, principal deputy assistant secretary of state, said the 
existence of tens of millions of mines will remain a major threat to civilians 
for years to come. "In addition to these tragic human costs, uncleared land 
mines hinder the repatriation of refugees and economic development and pose a 
continuing threat to political stability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is helping to clear mines in Cambodia, Afghanistan, 
Nicaragua and Mozambique, as well as providing aid to Eritrea, Ethiopia, 
Honduras and Costa Rica, he said. While there are major problems with mines in 
Angola, Somalia, Rwanda and Liberia, he said, continuing conflict in those 
nations has prevented clearance of mine fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali said the presence of mines in many countries is a great obstacle 
to postwar development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vast tracts of potentially productive land have been literally turned into 
no-man's lands, abandoned as the result of extensive mining," he said. "Most of 
the nearly 20 million refugees in the world today want to return home, but U.N. 
assistance for repatriation and the repopulating of former war zones is being 
drastically impeded because of uncleared mines." 
</P>
<P>
 An international convention is urgently needed to reach agreement on a total 
ban on production, stockpiling, trade and use of mines, Boutros-Ghali said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter agreed, saying, "My preference, precipitated by the devastating results 
of land mine use, is that they ultimately will be banned." 
</P>
<P>
 Cyrus R. Vance, secretary of state under Carter, also supported a ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "Land mines have and continue to cause a human and economic catastrophe of 
monumental proportions," he said in a statement sent to the Senate 
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, while reducing the threat of nuclear war must remain the first 
priority of international arms control efforts, it is these small lethal 
weapons that are killing and wounding far more people every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing less than a total ban on production or use of anti-personnel mines, 
Vance said, will move the world closer to the goal of eliminating this 
"horrible scourge." 
</P>
<P>
 Leahy said he would introduce legislation next month to impose a one-year 
moratorium on U.S. production of anti-personnel land mines and urge the 
President to seek similar moratoriums by other nations that are leading 
producers of the devices.

NEO-NAZI ATTACK ON AFRICANS LEADS TO CRITICISM OF POLICE; GERMANY: THE DRUNKEN 
RIGHTISTS WERE 'HUNTING FOREIGNERS.' ONLY ONE OF 48 REMAINED IN CUSTODY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 German police drew harsh criticism Friday after failing to respond quickly to 
a bloody neo-Nazi attack on black Africans that led to one of the worst racial 
riots in Germany since a wave of rightist violence against foreigners began two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The fracas in the eastern city of Magdeburg started Thursday afternoon when 
dozens of drunken neo-Nazis drove through the streets "hunting foreigners" and 
assaulted a group of five Africans, according to police and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 Turkish-led foreigners and German leftists came to the Africans' 
defense, fighting pitched street battles with the rightists until police 
contained the clashes late in the night. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two foreigners were stabbed, one was beaten with iron bars, and 
several others were injured, according to police and press reports. Three 
rightists also suffered knife wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Police detained 48 alleged neo-Nazis but released all but one of them, 
incurring a rash of criticism from national media and political and business 
leaders. One Turkish rioter also was under arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Friday, Magdeburg police spokesman Burkhard Jach said the neo-Nazis 
"were drunk and obviously wanted to chase foreigners." He said that most of the 
people detained "are known to us." 
</P>
<P>
 But later, as public anger with police rose, Antonius Stockman, the Magdeburg 
police president, played down the incident, saying the attackers were not a 
homogeneous group of rightists but hooligans and rightist hangers-on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magdeburg is not a place of right-wing extremists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 German television reported, however, that the government Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution had warned police about the potential for 
right-wing violence in Magdeburg. And residents reported that a leftist youth 
club in town has been attacked by "skinheads" about 10 times in the last couple 
of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they reacted quickly to Thursday's clashes but conceded that they 
initially did not have enough officers on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was a national holiday in Germany, and police and witnesses said the 
teen-age neo-Nazis had been drinking. Torsten Boek, a Greens Party leader in 
Magdeburg, said he saw them driving about town Thursday afternoon, waving a 
military flag of the Kaiser Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the attack on the Africans were sketchy until the time the five 
sought refuge in a cafe. The neo-Nazis attacked the restaurant, throwing tables 
and chairs through the windows and shouting "Germany for Germans." 
</P>
<P>
 "The police definitely showed up too late," said Arab Oetzbay, the Turkish 
owner of the restaurant who declined to talk further about the incident, 
fearing a second attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The identity of the Africans was not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Magdeburg has a home for about 900 foreigners seeking asylum in Germany, but 
Horst Katzer, the deputy director of that institution, said he had been ordered 
by higher state officials not to give interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, the government's representative for foreigners' 
affairs, called the riot a new peak in a wave of radical rightist violence 
after German reunification. "The fact that people are being hunted mirrors the 
worst events of the Nazi period," she told German radio. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl called the bloodshed "a shame" and said 
the government would do all it could to prevent further violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignatz Bubis, leader of Germany's Jewish community, expressed outrage, saying: 
"I can't understand how something like this can happen. That the police can't 
manage to protect people is a scandal." 
</P>
<P>
 He called for disciplinary action against the police and said it was 
"inconceivable" that all but one of those arrested were released without being 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 In Magdeburg, townsfolk scarcely reacted to the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of right-wing attacks on foreigners has been declining in the last 
year after a series of fatal attacks in Moelln, Rostock and Solingen in 1992 
and 1993. But in November of last year, black members of the U.S. luge team 
were attacked in a discotheque in the east German town of Oberhof where they 
had been training for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, in Bonn, the nation's governing coalition on Friday agreed to back 
legislation making it a crime to claim that the Nazis' mass murder of Jews is a 
lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition leaders said passage was expected next Friday in Parliament. 
Conviction of disseminating the "Auschwitz Lie," named after the Nazi death 
camp in Poland, would be punishable by three years in prison.

MUSLIMS GOT IRANIAN ARMS, BOSNIAN SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Muslim-led government's army received weapons and explosives smuggled from 
Iran and elsewhere in violation of a 1991 U.N. arms embargo, a senior Bosnian 
military source said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The report of the shipments came a day after the U.S. Senate voted to urge 
President Clinton to work to lift the U.N. arms embargo on the Bosnian 
government, which is outgunned by the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia-Herzegovina's government has long pleaded for an end to the arms 
embargo, which has effectively left it the only faction in the country without 
heavy weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Bosnian army 
received hundreds of antitank rockets. The source claimed that they were 
American-made but would not say what country sent them. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the rockets reached the Croatian coast aboard a ship from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. military analyst in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said he had no knowledge of such a military shipment to 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian army source also confirmed that explosives and other raw materials 
for ammunition had come from Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Post reported last Friday that Iran delivered about 60 tons of 
these supplies to Croatia's capital, Zagreb, last week. They were in crates 
marked "Humanitarian Aid" and "No Smoking," the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing unidentified diplomats and Bosnian Muslim sources, the Post said an 
Iranian Boeing 747 jumbo jet delivered the shipment May 4, two days before a 
visit to Bosnia and Croatia by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. Eric Chaperon, a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo, said he found it hard to 
imagine that an Iranian jumbo jet could land in Croatia, which also is under 
the 1991 arms embargo, and that no one policing the embargo would have 
inspected the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent U.N. doubts about the reports raised speculation that the Bosnian 
army might want Serbian troops to believe that the Muslims have more 
sophisticated weaponry than they actually do. 
</P>
<P>
 In Zagreb, Josip Rajcic, a Croatian Defense Ministry spokesman, denied that 
his country played any role in violating the embargo, and Interior Ministry 
spokesman Mladen Lackovic denied any knowledge of weapons smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian officials impounded a large shipment of rifles and ammunition that 
arrived in Zagreb aboard an Iranian-owned Boeing 747 in September, 1992. That 
shipment, listed as humanitarian aid, was believed to have been intended for 
Bosnian Muslims.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the reports of Iranian military shipments, Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher said Friday in Geneva: "I suppose it's only inevitable -- 
not desirable, but inevitable -- that there will be some leakage." But, he 
added, "the United States expects compliance with the embargo."

FORMER TOP RUSSIAN OFFICIAL BLAMES 'IMMORAL POWER' FOR NATION'S CRISIS; 
POLITICS: ALEXEI KAZANNIK, WHO GAVE UP HIS POST AS PROSECUTOR GENERAL, SAYS 
YELTSIN IS MANIPULATED BY HIS TOP AIDES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe Alexei Kazannik was naive. Maybe the Russian press is right to dub him a 
Don Quixote. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a turbulent land without much of a moral compass, Kazannik is one of 
the few public figures to distinguish loudly between right and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazannik has slammed the door on the Kremlin halls of power, giving up his job 
as Russia's prosecutor general to return home to Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason for Russia's crisis is ineffective and immoral power on all 
levels," Kazannik said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the usual rhetoric. What is unusual is that he was so outraged that he 
went on to give details of the ineffectiveness and immorality he had seen in 
the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazannik said President Boris N. Yeltsin is manipulated by his top aides and 
that Yeltsin just "serves the interests of a narrow corporative group" -- or 
what in Russian politics is known as his "circle," an entourage of aides and 
advisers who were chosen largely for their personal loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 In Yeltsin's just-released book, titled "The Struggle for Russia" in its U.S. 
edition, he admits to chronic trouble with friends, advisers and the mechanics 
of making his administration run. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kazannik went much further, saying that the men around Yeltsin take the 
approach that "we can do anything," regardless of the law and the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 He alleged, without going into detail, that they are also enriching themselves 
through their influence on the president. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only say the president is weak -- he can't stand off bad advice and 
pressure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazannik's moral clash with Yeltsin was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 It came in February, when Parliament issued an amnesty letting all Yeltsin's 
worst political enemies out of jail and off the hook for their rebellion 
against him last October. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazannik did not like the amnesty, but he could see that it was 
constitutional, and he ordered the men released. 
</P>
<P>
 The displeasure from Yeltsin's circle was so great that Kazannik, unwilling to 
back down, quit his job and gave up a palatial Moscow apartment in the same 
building as the president. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned home to Omsk, to his old job as a university law professor at 
one-fifth his Moscow salary and to his book-lined apartment looking out on a 
chemical plant and a prison camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor general's rejection of Yeltsin packs special impact because of 
how Kazannik first gained political fame. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, when Communists had deprived Yeltsin of a seat in the new Soviet 
legislature, Kazannik admired him enough to give his own spot to him, a 
dramatic gesture that helped Yeltsin in his rise to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazannik's transformation also reflects the general trend in Russian society: 
The people who gave Yeltsin a solid majority in his presidential run in 1991 
now accord him a 19% approval rating -- his lowest ever -- according to a 
recent national poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazannik, with his straight gaze and distinctive black-and-white beard, has 
turned from being Yeltsin's supporter into an accuser willing to reveal what he 
knows of the inner workings of the president's administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in his Omsk apartment, he said that if not for the amnesty, his 
office's investigation of the October rebellion in Moscow would almost surely 
have ended in charges against both the anti-Yeltsin rebels and the Kremlin 
officials who ordered the shelling and storming of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Given two or three more weeks to dig, he said, his team of investigators would 
almost surely have proven that the storming of the White House could have been 
avoided if the rebels had been offered a new chance to surrender or to continue 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes that top Kremlin officials could have been charged with abuse of 
power and that the soldiers who killed some of the 147 victims could have been 
charged for obeying orders to shoot to kill. 
</P>
<P>
 This is clearly not the kind of legal chief Yeltsin wanted after the trauma of 
the White House fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazannik said some people had warned him that if he tried to bring charges 
against top officials, "they'll remove you physically." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after he took the prosecutor general's job, Kazannik received an unsigned 
note from the Kremlin on how to run the October attempted coup case.  
</P>
<P>
 He recalled that it read like this: "No political trials, no specially created 
investigative brigade, appoint a few investigators, do the investigation within 
10 days and bring charges against everyone on Article 102 and 102-17" -- murder 
and serving as an accomplice to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The case then goes to the military court, and in three days all are to be 
sentenced to execution," the note read, according to Kazannik. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believed at first that some crazy person had written it but later 
came to understand that it had been a Yeltsin aide. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Kazannik's most ominous topics is the influence on Yeltsin of Alexander 
Korzhakov. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's longtime bodyguard, Korzhakov is such a close and proven friend that 
he appears able to influence Yeltsin deeply on a variety of matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Korzhakov is a very limited person, with a weak education, but he can get 
Yeltsin to sign any decree," Kazannik said. "Everyone in the administration 
knows and says that if Korzhakov wants, he can prepare a draft decree that 
Yeltsin is resigning because of his health, and Yeltsin, not reading it, will 
sign it -- and only in a few days will he find out he decreed his own 
retirement." 
</P>
<P>
 Kazannik's model of the Kremlin workings might partly explain some peculiar 
decrees that have come from there. Recent scandals have erupted over a decree 
misworded to make it sound like Russia planned military bases in the Baltics 
and over special privileges for a luxurious sports center to be run partly by a 
presidential friend. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kazannik, the problem was not only with Yeltsin's aides but also with the 
president himself and a general disregard for the law. 
</P>
<P>
 When Parliament issued the amnesty, Yeltsin countered with a decree ordering 
top officials to interpret it as illegal and ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazannik, appalled because he could see that the amnesty was legal, called 
Yeltsin and asked him to withdraw the decree. 
</P>
<P>
 "He very angrily said, ' Nyet ,' " Kazannik recalled, "and I said, 'Boris 
Nikolayevich, you're consciously violating the constitution,' and he again said 
simply, ' Nyet .' Then I said, 'Accept my resignation, because I can't fulfill 
your order.' And he said, ' Nyet . Find a way out, but don't carry out the 
amnesty.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After Kazannik ordered the amnesty and resigned, one of his deputies told him 
of being summoned to the Kremlin and offered the newly vacated job -- on the 
condition that he would take back the amnesty and rearrest those who had 
already been released. The deputy refused, Kazannik said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazannik offers a dozen other examples of dirty politics inside the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the request that he find evidence that Valery D. Zorkin, then 
chairman of the Constitutional Court, had committed a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was the time he was offered a luxurious government dacha -- only to 
find out that it had last belonged to one of the rebels he had recently 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I arrested the person and I'm supposed to live in his dacha ?" Kazannik 
asked, appalled that the officials who offered him the house did not even sense 
the impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed at how this administration breaks people," Kazannik said of the 
widespread distribution of perks that soon become habit-forming. "Some it buys 
with apartments and cars, some fall into a situation in which they compromise 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 After his hard look at how the political machine runs, Kazannik reached the 
conclusion that Russia is headed toward dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sources of power are subordinated directly to the president, and the 
president and his team have shown that for them, 'The law is very loose, it can 
be bent any way it suits you,' " Kazannik said, quoting an old saying summing 
up traditional Russian disrespect for the law. 
</P>
<P>
 He questioned whether presidential elections will be allowed to go ahead as 
planned in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Omsk, Kazannik is working on setting up his own party, to be known as 
the Party of National Conscience, to compete in the 1996 elections if they 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Siberians are different from Muscovites, he said, and support the idea of a 
party to fight for basic honesty and morality. 
</P>
<P>
 Two volunteer bodyguards block the many visitors who come to the five-story 
walk-up where Kazannik lives, and letters often reach him addressed simply to 
"Omsk, Kazannik." 
</P>
<P>
 Kazannik, born in Ukraine, said he developed "a terrible hatred of lies" as he 
was growing up and hearing teachers claim that Soviet children lived better 
than anyone else in the world -- even as some of his schoolmates were literally 
starving to death. 
</P>
<P>
 He is somewhat insulted when people call him a Don Quixote, seeing himself as 
more of a realist. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't believe in the possibility of transforming society and 
transforming the government, it wouldn't be worth living," he said.

FIGHTING IN YEMEN CONTINUES WHILE TRUCE IS PURSUED

<P>
 Southern Yemeni forces Friday reported a 10th day of fighting with northern 
civil war foes as Arab League officials tried to broker a cease-fire in the 
capital, Sana. 
</P>
<P>
 A southern military statement said the south was countering northern attacks 
in the mountainous Dhala region, which lies on a key road to the southern 
bastion of Aden. 
</P>
<P>
 A northern military spokesman said Thursday that northern forces had captured 
the province and city of Dhala, 65 miles north of Aden. 
</P>
<P>
 A pool report by a journalist taken to Dhala by the northern-based Defense 
Ministry said troops took the town Thursday evening after southern forces 
retreated peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 An Arab League mission led by Assistant Secretary General Mohammed Said 
Bereqdar met government officials in Sana in the north and was due to meet 
President Ali Abdullah Saleh later. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Yemeni leaders proposed an eight-point peace plan calling for the 
immediate cessation of the civil war and the formation of a national salvation 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The southern-based Yemen Socialist Party said in a statement that its plan 
also called for the rival armies to return to the positions they held before 
the war.

DOLE PROPOSES BIPARTISAN PANEL TO SET HAITI POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, warning against any hasty decision to invade 
Haiti, proposed Friday that a bipartisan panel be formed to develop a new 
policy toward the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's high time for cooler heads to prevail on U.S. policy toward Haiti," Dole 
(R-Kan.) said in a Senate floor speech."The Administration appears to be 
lurching toward the use of military force in Haiti without thoroughly 
considering the consequences of such action and the history of U.S. involvement 
in Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 The comments came hours after U.S. officials denied that a huge mock invasion 
this week that involved 44,000 military personnel had anything to do with a 
Haitian invasion scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that happens in this hemisphere, whether it be a troop movement or 
an exercise, people are trying to tie to reports of a Haiti invasion. It's just 
not valid," said Air Force Maj. Jamie Roach, a spokeswoman for the U.S. 
Atlantic Command. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said Congress should authorize any deployment of military forces in 
Haiti. He proposed the establishment of a bipartisan fact-finding commission 
whose recommendations could form the basis of a new Haiti policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The press has been full of invasion rumors. On Wednesday, the Pentagon and the 
White House strongly denied a Los Angeles Times report that the United States 
was planning a military operation with the aim of "purging" the Haitian army, 
which overthrew Haiti's elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Friday, military officials sought to knock down a story in the Boston 
Globe on the invasion exercise.

 This nation's ruling party took a historic step toward opening the Mexican 
political system by participating in the first nationwide televised debate 
among presidential candidates -- and found Friday that the move was costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash polls showed that the Thursday night debate trimmed up to seven points 
from the impressive lead of Ernesto Zedillo, the candidate of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, or PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Yale-educated economist remained in first place, with 38% of those 
questioned saying they would make him president, according to polls conducted 
immediately after the 90-minute encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the reticent candidate of the leftist Democratic 
Revolutionary Party, or PRD, appeared to have suffered the most. He dropped 
from second to third place in flash voter polls in major cities. Cardenas, who 
refused to wear makeup for the cameras, is known for a deadpan style that 
appeals to rural voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, candidate of the right-wing National Action 
Party, or PAN, clearly won the debate, up to two-thirds of those questioned in 
four polls said. Viewers said they found him clear, convincing, knowledgeable 
and realistic. He was also responsible for the debate's few moments of humor, 
such as when he told Zedillo, "You are a good boy with high grades, but in 
democracy, you flunked." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, who gained a reputation as a debater when in the Mexican Congress, 
more than doubled his support, moving from third place to a solid second in the 
presidential race, based on a poll conducted by the independent newspaper 
Reforma. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper surveyed a focus group, not the electorate at large. And its 
quick results, like those of all flash polls, contain significant margins of 
error, especially since the election is still months away, analysts cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday's debate offered the most visible sign of the nascent democratic 
reforms that are growing increasingly evident here as Mexico approaches its 
Aug. 21 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The debate . . . is a great step forward in Mexico's democratic life and 
reflects the new political culture that our great nation is experiencing," 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said. "This change . . . is also the 
product of the electoral reforms that have been achieved through dialogue with 
the various political factions in our great country." 
</P>
<P>
 Reforms providing for citizen observers at voter precincts and turning control 
of the Federal Electoral Commission, which runs elections, over to citizens 
from the political parties were passed by Congress late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The government this week also asked the United Nations to advise Mexican 
election observers and to issue a report on the computerized electoral system. 
Citizens have been invited to audit voter rolls and to inspect the computer 
center where ballots will be counted. 
</P>
<P>
 All these measures are a clear attempt to avoid charges of fraud that marred 
the 1988 presidential election and many other votes before and since. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's televised candidate confrontation played an important role in 
promoting a democratic image for Mexico. "The debate had the enormous challenge 
of restoring confidence in the political system, which it succeeded in doing," 
media analyst Raul Trejo said. "It exceeded expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez and Cardenas, who many Mexicans believe was cheated out of a victory 
in the 1988 presidential election, attacked 65 years of rule by a single party, 
the PRI. While Cardenas largely ignored Fernandez, the PAN candidate 
energetically criticized Cardenas, a former PRI governor, who he said is 
obsessed with becoming president. "You have one face in the opposition and 
another in the government," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez promised an end to the near-dictatorial powers of the presidency by 
strengthening the judicial and legislative branches of the federal government 
as well as state and municipal governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas, meantime, took a page from former President Ronald Reagan's debate 
book, charging, "No one is better off than in 1988." He promised an economic 
policy that takes people into account and a convention to revise the 
much-amended Mexican constitution. Analysts said that in trying to counteract a 
radical image, Cardenas looked as if he lacked fervor; he lost support as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo, a former education minister, emphasized his campaign promises of 
turning economic growth into jobs, improving schools and reforming the criminal 
justice system to eliminate corruption and insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate took place in an atmosphere of increasing political awareness among 
Mexicans. More than 90% of the voting-age population -- 43 million people -- 
have registered to vote and picked up their photo identification. 
</P>
<P>
 That awareness is expected to increase as a result of the debate, which an 
estimated 30 million television viewers saw, besides Mexicans who listened on 
the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "The debate is . . . very important," said Jose Angel Gurria, PRI's secretary 
of international affairs. "It will have the salutary effect of interesting 
people in the process."

ISRAEL LOWERS ITS FLAG, RELINQUISHES JERICHO TO THE PLO; MIDEAST: PALESTINIANS 
CELEBRATE WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS AFTER 27 YEARS OF OCCUPATION. 
</P>

<P>
 Israel ended its 27 years of occupation of this West Bank town Friday and 
handed the area over to the Palestine Liberation Organization, the first step 
in what is meant to become a broader withdrawal from the region as it becomes 
self-governing. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli soldiers somberly lowered and folded their country's blue-and-white 
flag with its Star of David from building after building -- the police station, 
government offices, military headquarters -- where it had flown so assertively 
for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 To the cheers of hundreds of townspeople, Palestinian police hoisted in its 
place the Palestinian flag -- stripes of black, white and green, intersected by 
a red triangle -- and it waved briskly in the desert wind. 
</P>
<P>
 People sang "Biladi, Biladi," the Palestinian anthem, and danced in the 
streets. Jericho quickly took on a festive air it has rarely known for a 
generation. The center of the ancient town, believed to be the world's oldest 
inhabited city, was filled with the celebrating crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just any other day," said Israeli Brig. Gen. Gadi Zohar, military 
governor of the occupied portions of the West Bank. "We hope, both us and the 
Palestinians, that it is the beginning of a new era, an era of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Although beset with delays over the last week, the transfer of power from 
Israel to the PLO went smoothly here Friday when 500 more men from the 
Palestine Liberation Army, reconstituted as the Palestine National Security 
Force, arrived from Jordan as the vanguard of the new Palestinian 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after dawn, Israeli authorities turned over the police station to the 
Palestinians to begin the transition; by 10 a.m., Israeli officials had handed 
over control of all 20 government departments; at 11 a.m., Israeli troops 
forced the remaining 50 Jewish settlers to leave an old synagogue in the city; 
by 2 p.m., the last Israeli soldiers had climbed into their patrol vehicles and 
left town. 
</P>
<P>
 Joint Israeli-Palestinian security patrols, flying both Israeli and 
Palestinian flags and the orange banner of the Israel-PLO liaison committee, 
soon began operation -- with dozens of local cars following in a sort of peace 
parade in and around the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moment was moving," said Maj. Gen. Ilan Biran, the Israeli commander of 
West Bank forces, after greeting the incoming Palestinians at the Allenby 
Bridge over the Jordan River. "We wished each other good luck. . . . We will 
see in the coming days if things are fully realized. The promises are many, but 
reality is a bit more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish settlers protested the transition, attempting to sit in at Jericho's 
1,400-year-old Peace Upon Israel Synagogue. But Israeli soldiers forced them 
out. Biran later barred all Israelis from the town on security grounds. He 
promised to allow their return next week so they can pray at the synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "To our embarrassment, they took down the Israeli flag (at the synagogue), and 
I am afraid they will fly a Palestinian flag there," said Uri Ariel, secretary 
of the Council of Jewish Communities of Judea, Samaria and Gaza. "I felt 
something choking in my throat at the sight of Palestinian policemen carrying 
Kalashnikov rifles at the synagogue. This is a difficult day." 
</P>
<P>
 But Biran said he believed that Jewish settlers around Jericho and in the 
Jordan Valley will come to accept the changes as part of the peace process, 
although much would depend on how the autonomy agreement is implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hitches are expected, mostly from misunderstanding," Biran said. "They must 
be prevented, brought down to a minimum." 
</P>
<P>
 Jericho's peaceful transition from Israeli to Palestinian control was 
tragically marred when a 9-year-old boy was killed and a young girl wounded by 
stray bullets fired by Palestinians during the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 With the additional transfer of much of the southern Gaza Strip, Palestinian 
police -- about 1,500 altogether -- were deployed Friday in more than half the 
area that will constitute the region of Palestinian autonomy. Israel captured 
both territories -- the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza from Egypt -- in the 
1967 Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have mixed feelings, to be honest with you," said Saeb Erekat, one of PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat's appointees to the Palestinian Authority, the council 
that will run Jericho and the Gaza Strip prior to autumn elections. "On the one 
hand, it really is a good feeling to see that the Palestinian flag is flying in 
the skies of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 "But at the same time you have to keep in mind what we are beginning -- the 
road ahead is really a difficult one. There are enormous challenges facing us. 
It is time to plant rather than to harvest. . . . What happened here is a step 
of just one centimeter in a journey that will be a hundred kilometers long." 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing for a personal reflection, Erekat added: "It is a very nice feeling to 
see the soldiers leave the building where I was jailed. Jericho is Palestinian 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom had come to Jericho shortly after dawn, and the town's 15,000 
residents awoke to find the police station, long a symbol of the Israeli 
occupation, with a giant Palestinian flag draped over the side of the stone 
building. Palestinian police, in khaki uniforms and green berets, were smiling 
down from its watchtower and roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "We woke up to freedom," said Ibrahim Aker, 33, a pharmacist. "It was a 
wonderful feeling. For people my age, who have only known the occupation, this 
is something we have been waiting for our entire lives. And after all the 
delays, all the negotiations, all the problems, it is hard to believe that, 
finally, Palestinians will be the masters of their home. It is not 
independence, but that is coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Nuzha Aboulhawa, 47, a social worker among Palestinian refugees, was 
celebrating too but was more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israelis wanted to get out of Gaza, and the price the PLO demanded and 
got was Jericho," she said. "Don't read more into the agreement than that. I 
hope and pray we will get all of the West Bank back, but there is no timetable 
for that. Nor is there agreement on the return of our people from refugee camps 
in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, on the future of Jerusalem and on the removal of 
these settlers from our midst. Appreciate what we have gained, but understand 
that it is far from everything."

<TEXT>
<P>
 A tornado carved a wide path through this central Texas city Friday, ripping 
off roofs, uprooting trees and damaging buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the city's 4,000 residents were without electricity after the tornado 
appeared about noon, sweeping off the roofs of a supermarket and other 
buildings and knocking over the wall of a manufacturing plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The were no reports of major injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of roofs off, trees are uprooted, there's a lot of damage," 
said Donna Klaeger, executive vice president of the local Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Tornadoes were also reported Friday in rural areas southwest and north of 
Austin, about 50 miles from Marble Falls. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service reported that torrential rains, accumulating at 
up to three inches an hour in some areas, fell throughout central Texas from 
late Thursday through Friday.

FDA FAULTS DRUG TESTERS IN PATIENT-DEATH PROBE; MEDICINE: SCIENTISTS, DRUG 
COMPANIES ARE ACCUSED OF FAILING TO FULLY DISCLOSE POTENTIAL RISKS OF 
HEPATITIS-B TREATMENT. FIVE PEOPLE DIED DURING TRIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal investigation into the deaths of five patients during a test of an 
experimental hepatitis-B drug has concluded that scientists and drug companies 
failed to fully disclose the drug's potential risks. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers in the 15-person, government-sponsored trial were also blinded 
by misplaced optimism in the drug and failed to recognize its ominous side 
effects, the investigation found. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, the researchers neither reduced nor halted use of the 
medication -- even after patients complained about its seeming ill effects, 
according to Food and Drug Administration documents released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a pattern here, a series of lapses both with regard to the 
reporting and the following of protocol," Dr. Roger Williams, associate 
director of the FDA's Center for Drugs Evaluation and Research, said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's documents leave unanswered the question of whether the deaths 
were preventable and Williams declined to comment on that aspect of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Hepatitis-B, which is caused by a virus, affects as many as 300 million people 
globally. In the United States, about 300,000 new cases are reported each year, 
while from 4,000 to 5,000 Americans die from the chronic effects of the 
infection -- cirrhosis of the liver, liver failure and liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have been eager to find a cure for the disease and were hoping that 
it would lie in the new drug, which is no longer being used. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulatory agency said the head of the study, Dr. Jay H. Hoofnagle, a 
government scientist, neglected to tell participants that a key purpose of the 
study was to determine the drug's safety and that he failed to adequately 
describe the drug's "foreseeable risks," such as toxicity to the central 
nervous system and liver. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA also directed scathing criticism at other investigators and at Eli 
Lilly & Co., which licensed the compound for the drug on trial, fialuridine, or 
FIAU, from Oclassen Pharmaceuticals Inc. of San Rafael, Calif., another target 
for criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA said the pattern of minimizing FIAU's potential risks began long 
before the drug trial in question and was established during the early years of 
its development. In 1991, for example, AIDS researchers began seeing toxic side 
effects from the drug but the FDA did not learn of them, in one case, until a 
year after a patient's death. The failure to communicate about the problems 
gave rise to an unjustified sense of hope for the drug and ultimately 
contributed to the fatalities, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation's conclusions come as another blow to the biomedical 
research world, which is still reeling from recent disclosures of outright 
fraud in a massive, international study of treatment options for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The FIAU study, which began in March, 1993, was halted in June but not in time 
to avert the five deaths. Three other patients had to undergo liver transplants 
as a result of the drug's toxic side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 In November as a result of the failed trial, the FDA adopted new drug-testing 
regulations that were proposed by an internal review task force. The new rules 
require researchers to gather and report more data on potentially adverse 
effects of trial drugs and to assume that any medical problems in patients may 
be caused by the test drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force also found that FIAU researchers missed important warning 
signals indicating the drug might be dangerous and dismissed patients' medical 
problems as the effects of other medications or prior medical conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoofnagle, the lead FIAU investigator, was out of town Friday and could not be 
reached for comment on the FDA's conclusion that he had committed "significant 
violations" of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Hoofnagle is a division 
director in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the parent National Institutes of Health said Hoofnagle will 
comply with the FDA's requirement that he respond within 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The NIH also has convened an independent panel to review the incident. Its 
report is scheduled for release June 2. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1993 interview with The Times, Hoofnagle said that certain symptoms among 
his patients had gone unrecognized because, he contended, some of FIAU's toxic 
effects mimicked the symptoms of chronic hepatitis-B itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA also said that Hoofnagle violated protocol by "not immediately 
reporting by telephone serious, unexpected or alarming adverse experiences" 
among the study subjects. Hoofnagle also neglected to report the 
hospitalization of subjects in writing to the drug companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA documents are rife with bureaucratic and biomedical research jargon, 
but occasional passages captured the agency's case against Hoofnagle. Referring 
to "Subject 06," for instance, the FDA listed a series of the patient's 
complaints and then concluded: 
</P>
<P>
 "Moderate fatigue on May 5, 1993; moderate fatigue and mild liver tenderness 
on May 5, 1993; moderate abdominal pain on May 25, 1993; moderate fatigue and a 
3-week history of right upper quadrant squeezing pain (liver) on June 2, 1993; 
yet you failed to reduce dosage. The subject decided to stop FIAU on June 15, 
1993, due to nausea and vomiting. The subject died on Aug. 31, 1993." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Lilly and Oclassen denied any wrongdoing Friday, saying that they 
would respond in detail to the FDA after examining the agency's letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA's "warning letters" require recipients to reply, Williams said, "and 
the response has to be satisfactory to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Possible follow-up actions by the agency include extracting certain assurances 
for future tests, conducting follow-up inspections or, in the worst-case 
scenario, disqualifying a scientist from participation in drug trials, Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recipients of FDA letters were researchers at the Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center in San Diego, the Children's Hospital in Seattle and the 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md. They 
were involved in the clinical trials involving a closely related forerunner of 
FIAU.

 An elementary school was evacuated and dozens of people taken to hospitals 
Friday after a student dropped a jar containing a powdered dye in the school's 
cafeteria, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 When a custodian at Riverview Elementary School used water to clean up the 
substance, a gas cloud formed, a spokesman for the Baltimore County Fire 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 students and adults were taken to Sinai Hospital in Baltimore for 
observation, a spokeswoman said. One of the adults complained of difficulty 
breathing, but none of the others was expected to be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 An unknown number of students were taken to other area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the spilled substance was dichloroindophenol, a dye used in 
laboratories. It was not clear what the student was doing with it on campus.

HIJACKERS ROB NORWEGIANS ON MIAMI HOTEL BUS

<P>
 A hotel shuttle bus carrying five Norwegian tourists was hijacked Friday by 
two men who robbed the passengers of their jewelry and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the hijackers, two "very well-dressed" black men in their 20s, 
boarded the bus with the Norwegians at Miami International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bus left the airport, one of the men pulled a gun and ordered the 
driver to head east on a nearby highway. The other man then robbed the 
tourists, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the robbers punched a woman in the face, police Detective Marie 
Duboulay said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did suffer minor injuries and she is OK," Duboulay said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair fled after ordering the driver to pull off the highway at the first 
exit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norwegian consul in Miami said the visitors were robbed of jewelry, cash 
and some luggage. Two also lost their passports. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a singular incident," said Metro-Dade Police spokesman Steve Ellison. 
"We haven't seen anything like this. It's new to us totally, and we are taking 
measures at this point to try and counter it as best as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting with police, the Norwegians later boarded a ship for a Caribbean 
cruise as planned.

ILLINOIS GOVERNOR SETS FREE FOUR WOMEN WHO KILLED ABUSIVE MATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The governor of Illinois has freed four women who were imprisoned for killing 
their abusive husbands or boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 "In each case, the battered women syndrome was an extraordinarily compelling 
reason for granting clemency," said Diane Ford, a lawyer for Gov. Jim Edgar. 
</P>
<P>
 Velma Taylor, Christine Popp, Mary Young and Betty Jordan were granted 
clemency Thursday and released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it at first," Popp said Friday. "I was excited, I was 
overwhelmed. I guess I had mixed feelings. It's kind of scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Popp, 46, shot her husband in 1987. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison. 
Generally, prisoners in Illinois who behave well in custody must serve half of 
their sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been given so much, and I want to be able to give some back in some 
way," Popp said. "I want to help women." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, 43, had been hospitalized repeatedly because of her live-in 
boyfriend's abuse. She stabbed him to death in 1990 and was sentenced to 14 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, 44, who stabbed her abusive boyfriend to death in 1991, was sentenced 
to six years. Jordan, 33, was sentenced to 10 years for shooting her boyfriend 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Illinois Clemency Project petitioned the state last month to release 12 
women convicted of murder. Edgar said only four cases met the standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cook County attorney's office condemned Edgar's decision.

SEC FREEZES ANAHEIM-BASED TIFFANY ESCROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the unwitting victims of the First Pension Corp. collapse, you can count 
Jeff Cleveland and his escrow company. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland is secretary and chief financial officer of Anaheim-based Tiffany 
Escrow Co., which has the misfortune of having been owned by Terri Cooper, the 
wife of First Pension Corp. principal William E. Cooper. But she sold the firm 
two years ago and it has operated independently ever since, Cleveland says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday 
requested and received a federal court injunction freezing the assets of 
Cooper, his partners and his firms, Tiffany Escrow was caught in the net. The 
SEC listed Tiffany as a subject firm and had its assets frozen too. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has hit me cold," Cleveland said late Friday afternoon, about an hour 
after he received word that his firm was financially immobilized. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the SEC had moved deliberately without informing the targets -- in 
order to keep them from moving assets out of its reach -- he only learned about 
it when a customer tried to wire funds into Tiffany's account at Monarch Bank 
in Laguna Niguel. The bank told the customer that it could accept no 
transactions involving the account. By then Cleveland's lawyer was out of reach 
and the chances of getting the freeze lifted before the weekend were dim. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will just put me out of business," Cleveland said, noting that his firm 
was handling about 150 to 200 escrows, most of them on Orange County 
residential property. He could not say how much money was at stake, or whether 
escrows in Tiffany's hands can close before the freeze is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Cooper remained on the management roster of the company, listed as 
president, until recently though her real involvement with the firm ended last 
year. Tiffany agreed to list her as an officer as long as deals she had brought 
in remained alive, Cleveland said. It was only when First Pension declared 
bankruptcy April 22 and its problems surfaced that he took immediate steps to 
excise her from the list, Cleveland said.

WOMAN LINKS COMPLAINING TO CLINTON, FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Meeting President Clinton was the most exciting day of Catherine Rosen's life. 
And now, she says, she is paying a price. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen says she was fired from her bookkeeping job Tuesday, a day after she 
discussed her health and insurance problems with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "They found out I had a problem and fired me," she said Friday. Lorrie McHugh, 
an Administration spokeswoman on health care matters, said the White House was 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton called Rosen on Friday evening and "expressed his concern and sent his 
best wishes and said he hopes all would be well," McHugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen's former employer, Peter Sharp & Co., said in a statement it had no 
knowledge of her medical condition or the substance of her meeting with Clinton 
when it decided to let her go. The Manhattan real estate company said she was 
fired for unspecified "valid business reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen had written to First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in support of the 
President's health care reform efforts. She was one of three women invited to 
meet with Clinton after he gave a health care speech in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen told the President that she had discovered a "potentially 
life-threatening" breast lump two months ago. The doctor advised that she 
needed surgery to determine whether it was cancerous, she said, but she could 
not afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 She had lost her health insurance when she changed jobs, and the real estate 
company's health policy required her to wait 11 months for coverage of a 
pre-existing condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen said the day after she met Clinton, fellow workers chatted up the new 
celebrity in their midst. But none of the bosses asked her what it was like to 
meet the President. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4 p.m., one of the bosses said she should stop in his office before she 
left for the day. At 5 p.m., she said, she was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 The boss told Rosen that she was "not living up to their expectations" after 
six weeks on the job. It was the first complaint she'd heard about her work, 
she said.

A TALE OF FOUR SCHOOLS; AT DALTON, 'YOU DON'T JUST LISTEN TO THE TEACHER, YOU 
FIND IT FOR YOURSELF' 
</P>

<P>
 When thoughtfully integrated into a curriculum, multimedia technology can be a 
powerful educational tool. 
</P>
<P>
 The elite Dalton School in Manhattan received a $3-million, three-year grant 
from the Tishman real estate family for computer education. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton's sixth-graders use advanced Apple Macintoshes to "excavate" objects 
from a simulated archeological site. Dubbed "Archaeotype," the computer 
simulation grew out of a third-grade game in which students dig in a sandbox 
for objects and analyze them. On the computer, they drag a mouse to do the 
digging, find a full-color picture of the object and then weigh and measure it 
using special software tools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more fun," said Daniel Ruch, a precocious 12-year-old. "You don't 
just listen to the teacher; you find it for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton has shared the program with a school in Chula Vista, south of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at Dalton, a big gap exists in evaluating the effectiveness of computers. 
Bill Waldman, director of the school's technology program, said, "You can just 
tell by looking at the kids' faces" that they are getting a lot out of 
Archaeotype and other computer programs. Still, the school is working to 
develop new assessment tools. JONATHAN WEBER

A TALE OF FOUR SCHOOLS; AT DRAKE, NEW ENTHUSIASM FOR WRITING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Writing turns out to be one of the areas in which computers can make a big 
difference in education. 
</P>
<P>
 In the business world, word processing was long considered an underuse of a 
$2,000 to $3,000 machine, but it nonetheless became one of the most important 
computer applications.In the classroom, teachers have discovered that children 
write more and better when they can easily edit their compositions and then see 
a clean printout. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sir Francis Drake Elementary School in an impoverished section of San 
Francisco, the computer lab is a simple affair, with old Apple II computers as 
standard equipment. The children are enthusiastic, especially about writing -- 
and especially about a project in which they fax letters to business executives 
in faraway places. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way of relating to what the rest of the world is doing," said Ray 
Porter, computer consultant for the city's public schools. JONATHAN WEBER

A TALE OF FOUR SCHOOLS; AT MARTIN LUTHER KING JR., FINAL VERDICT IS NOT IN

<P>
 Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School, where about 70% of the students are 
black and the rest Latino or Cambodian, is in many ways typical of schools that 
have opted for federally funded integrated learning systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Two ILS labs manufactured by Jostens Learning Corp. are linked to computers in 
classrooms throughout the building. The computer programs walk students through 
practice math problems or help them build vocabulary and spelling skills 
through picture identification. 
</P>
<P>
 A roomful of second-graders sit attentively at their machines, headphones in 
place, working through the day's lesson and practicing their writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This class has grown a lot. Most of the kids are reading at their grade 
level, which is amazing," said Julia McPhail, a second-grade teacher. "They 
like being on the computer, almost too much. It's quick-paced, colorful and 
gives them instant feedback. But sometimes after they've been sitting a long 
time they get bored; 50 minutes is a little long." 
</P>
<P>
 Another teacher said the sessions were sometimes "too much like a testing 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The final verdict is not in. Principal Claude Jenkins is pleased with the 
system -- but it is too early to see the results on standardized tests.

A TALE OF FOUR SCHOOLS; AT VISTA VERDE, ON THE INTERNET 'IT'S MORE FUN THAN 
PLAYING NINTENDO'

 Sixth-grader R.J. Marshall and eighth-grader Yousuf Dalal are taking turns at 
the keyboard of an Apple PowerBook portable computer, sending messages across 
Internet to a student in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, Marshall and Dalal hardly were computer literate. But last 
fall, they took a class taught by Principal Bruce Terry at the public Vista 
Verde Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they know more than most adults about the global Internet that links 
20,000 computer networks and 20 million users. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom was pretty impressed," says Dalal, 13. "It's more fun than playing 
Nintendo." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides keeping in touch with a pen pal in Adelaide, the boys send messages to 
President Clinton, research class reports and spend hours roaming cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry and Jim Soderberg, a fourth- and fifth-grade teacher, pushed the school 
into the Information Age seven years ago. They bought two computers, primitive 
by today's standards, and learned to use them. Then they shared their knowledge 
with Vista Verde's 25 teachers, hoping to make the school a model for computer 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Vista Verde spends about 1% of its annual budget, up to $20,000, on computer 
equipment and software. It receives help from a cadre of graduate students in 
the computer science department at UC Irvine, which gives the school access to 
Internet. Local high-tech companies donate equipment, parents donate money and 
the school holds fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the results: The school's achievement test scores have climbed steadily. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't use technology for technology's sake," Soderberg said. "We want 
programs that enhance what we're already doing. I look at the computer as 
having another aide in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-graders learn to touch-type in a lab with 32 Apple IIe and IIgs 
computers -- models from the early days of the personal computer revolution. 
Eight computers are used to teach English to immigrant children. 
</P>
<P>
 August Lobato assigns his fourth-graders to look at a picture of a California 
mission on a laser disc and then do research. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get so excited they can't wait for me," he said. "When you design these 
projects, you make them open-ended so the students can take it as far as they 
want. The next big thing is to get them to do multimedia presentations. By the 
time this generation of kids enters the business world, they'll be carrying 
their hand-held computers."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; WILSON AD SPARKS CHARGES OF IMMIGRANT-BASHING; 
POLITICS: COMMERCIAL DESCRIBES HIS EFFORTS TO GET U.S. TO PAY FOR STATE 
SERVICES TO FOREIGNERS. BUT CRITICS SAY IT COULD INFLAME ETHNIC TENSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a new campaign commercial that immediately prompted charges of 
immigrant-bashing, Gov. Pete Wilson uses footage of illegal immigrants 
scurrying across the border to dramatize a problem that the governor has put at 
the top of his political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The advertisement, which began airing Friday, describes the pressure Wilson 
has put on the federal government to tighten border enforcement and reimburse 
California for the costs of services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep coming," an announcer intones as the ad opens with black-and-white 
video of about a dozen Latino immigrants dodging cars at the border in San 
Ysidro. "Two-million illegal immigrants in California. The federal government 
won't stop them at the border, yet requires us to pay billions to take care of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The pictures and the words carry an ominous message that Wilson's critics said 
could inflame ethnic tensions, an allegation the governor's spokesmen denied. 
Several compared the ad to the famous 1988 George Bush commercial featuring 
Willie Horton, the black murderer furloughed by Massachusetts during the 
Administration of Gov. Michael Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson has found that immigrants can be used the way Willie Horton was 
used, and to some degree he's right," said Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles). 
"How many immigrants can vote? None. How many do you find contributing massive 
amounts of money to campaigns? None. It's a no-lose strategy for him." 
</P>
<P>
 With the image of foreigners streaming into California to take things that 
legal California residents consider their own -- jobs, services and tax dollars 
-- the commercial represents the Wilson campaign's latest effort to capitalize 
on the public's concern over illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 That concern has risen during Wilson's term as hundreds of thousands of 
Californians have lost their jobs in the worst economic downturn since the 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson at times has said he admires the courage of immigrants who flee poverty 
for a better life in the United States. But none of that admiration is on 
display in this ad. Instead, viewers see Wilson assuring them he is doing all 
he can to tackle the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 He is doing it, Wilson says in the ad, "for Californians who work hard, pay 
taxes and obey the laws." 
</P>
<P>
 The phrase "They keep coming" that opens Wilson's ad applies in this case to 
illegal immigrants. But it is broad enough, Wilson's opponents said, to include 
everyone who is different from California's dwindling but politically dominant 
white majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word they is obviously a veiled reference to a specific group of people 
who tend to be perceived as having certain attributes in common," said Darry 
Sragow, campaign director for Democrat John Garamendi. "One of those 
attributes, of course, is that if they are illegal, they don't belong in this 
country. But in the perception of most voters, these people also are not white 
and don't speak English as a first language." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who is also seeking the Democratic 
nomination, said Wilson's ad uses the "language of scapegoating." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden added: "It's as if some kind of alien 'them' is the primary cause of 
our education and unemployment and environmental problems." 
</P>
<P>
 In the ad, Wilson says that he wants to deny state services to illegal 
immigrants. But Wilson supports providing emergency health care to illegal 
immigrants, and he has not committed to trying to remove immigrants from public 
schools. He also vetoed a bill that would have required the deportation of 
illegal immigrants convicted of felonies and serving time in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Wilson wants the federal government to give California another $2.5 
billion a year for education, health and prison programs and has led a 
bipartisan effort by California lawmakers to wrest that money from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also mentions the lawsuit he filed last month against the Clinton 
Administration and says that he has "sent the National Guard to help the Border 
Patrol." It does not also say that the federal government is paying most of the 
expenses for the 176 soldiers through a program meant to check international 
drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is trying to change the focus from his failed economic record to blaming 
immigrants for his reelection problems," said John Whitehurst, a spokesman for 
Democratic candidate Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 All three Democratic candidates also criticized Wilson for failing in eight 
years as a U.S. senator to do anything to curb immigration and pointed out that 
Wilson sponsored legislation to make it easier for immigrant farm workers to 
enter the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 George Gorton, Wilson's campaign manager, said the commercial simply focuses 
on a problem about which the public already is concerned and tells the voters 
how the governor is addressing it. He denied that the ad has racial overtones 
or was designed to kindle fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what you call a real commercial about real issues and it's exactly 
what a campaign ought to be about," Gorton said. "You don't create problems in 
politics. Problems are either there or they're not there. Picturing them is 
what you do." 
</P>
<P>
 The footage, Gorton said, understates the problem. "There are 2 million 
illegal aliens in California," he said. "That shows a few people." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, federal officials at a recent conference in Sacramento put the 
number of illegal immigrants in the state at 1.3 million to 1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson press secretary Dan Schnur said the ad will run for about two weeks at 
a cost of about $1 million.

WILSON URGES INQUIRY INTO FAILED $44-MILLION DMV COMPUTER SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson joined the Legislature on Friday in asking the state auditor 
to investigate the Department of Motor Vehicles' expenditure of $44 million on 
a computer system that never worked. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking the investigation, Wilson sought to distance his Administration of 
the DMV from that of his predecessor, Gov. George Deukmejian.Wilson took office 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson contended that $33 million of the amount spent on the project occurred 
before his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, DMV officials acknowledged to the Legislature that $44 million had 
been spent on a major database revision during the past seven years, but that 
the project had no hope of working. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Zolin, who succeeded A. Del Pierce as department director in 1991, said 
he ordered the project abandoned several months ago rather than pour more money 
into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, now director of the California Lottery, said in an interview that the 
computer project was "progressing satisfactorily" when Zolin succeeded him in 
1991.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; DANNEMEYER TV AD PAINTS RIVAL HUFFINGTON AS

 Hoping to boost his struggling campaign for the Republican U.S. Senate 
nomination, candidate William E. Dannemeyer began broadcasting a television 
commercial this week attacking his major opponent, Michael Huffington, as a 
liberal who cannot beat Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer's campaign is short on cash and he will not be able to compete on 
television at the same level as the other major statewide candidates this year, 
especially Huffington, a Santa Barbara congressman who has contributed more 
than $4 million of his personal fortune to the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer's campaign declined to reveal how much it would pay for television 
ads, but officials said the candidate would use some of his own money and they 
promised to broadcast commercials throughout the state, including on network 
stations in Los Angeles.

 Even with few commercials, Dannemeyer hopes to be effective by aiming his ads 
for conservative Republicans, who play a significant role in GOP primaries. To 
reach those voters, campaign officials said, the ads will air during 
conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh's television program and on stations in 
GOP-rich areas such as San Diego and Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 One commercial says Huffington could not beat Feinstein, the Democratic 
incumbent, because the two are so politically similar that voters would have 
little reason to replace Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial complains about four votes Huffington cast in Congress, 
including his support for gays in the military, funding for the National 
Endowment for the Arts and President Clinton's Family Leave Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the opposite of congressman Huffington on these issues," Dannemeyer says 
in the ad. "If we Republicans hope to defeat liberal Dianne Feinstein, we have 
to nominate a conservative alternative, not a liberal like Michael Huffington." 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer's other two commercials highlight his recognition as a 
congressional tax-fighter in 1992 and his warning about erosion of the 
Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer has struggled throughout the spring to gain credibility for his 
second consecutive Senate campaign. Most California Republican leaders believe 
Huffington will win the primary because they expect him to outspend his 
opponents by at least 10 to 1. Huffington has essentially ignored Dannemeyer, 
focusing instead on the general election against Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Among conservatives, Dannemeyer also has been forced to share some support 
with Riverside attorney Kate Squires, a political newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Dannemeyer held a news conference in Sacramento to generate some 
interest in his effort. He facetiously declared that he will file a missing 
person's report for Huffington, because he has not seen his opponent since the 
two appeared together in February. 
</P>
<P>
 He also called attention to the fact that Huffington only moved to California 
from Houston in 1991. Dannemeyer suggested that police searching for the 
missing candidate might check into luggage stores where Huffington might have 
gone to repair his carpetbag. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has rejected Dannemeyer's call for debates in the primary.

<P>
 "It's amazing when you realize some of the knucklehead laws that still remain 
on the law books in California," O'Connell said, adding that he hopes other 
legislators will come up with additional statutes that are no longer needed and 
should be repealed.

GEYSER AWAKENS AFTER 4.6 QUAKE AT YELLOWSTONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A geyser that has not been active for more than 80 years has begun erupting 
again and three other geysers and a number of hot springs have shown 
significant changes in activity since a March 26 earthquake in Yellowstone 
National Park, a park scientist reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4.6 magnitude quake near the Norris Geyser Basin was not of a particularly 
uncommon strength for Yellowstone, the site of a 600,000-year-old volcanic 
caldera. But it has had unusual effects, said Rick Hutchinson, a research 
geologist with the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarch Geyser, which used to send water shooting up close to 200 feet but 
had not erupted since 1913, has become active, periodically expelling rocks, 
mud and water to a height of about 15 feet, Hutchinson said. The temperature of 
the water now often is at the boiling point. 
</P>
<P>
 Also stirring to life after 15 years of inactivity has been the Ledge Geyser, 
which has begun shooting water up to 130 feet high at a 30-degree angle every 
week or 10 days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The geologist said that the Steamboat Geyser, the park's tallest, shooting 
water nearly 400 feet high, has had a decrease in some of its side splashing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the earthquake, the amount of splashing has diminished in frequency and 
intensity," Hutchinson said. "Now, there's virtually no runoff, whatsoever, 
whereas in the past it occurred every two to five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Monarch, Ledge and Steamboat are in the Norris Basin about 30 miles north of 
Old Faithful Geyser, the park's most famous, which was not affected by the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-week resurgence of activity was also noted at the Morning Geyser, in the 
Fountain Paintpot area of the Lower Geyser Basin, just eight miles from Old 
Faithful, Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientist said that the water level suddenly dropped after the earthquake 
in some hot springs, while temperatures rose in others. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the geysers with changed activity are within easy walking distance of 
paved roads and accessible to park visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, Yellowstone has between 200 and 250 active geysers in any given 
year. Magma or lava deeply underlying the park is believed to heat water 
through a vast underground plumbing system, causing the activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchinson said that the last earthquake activity to cause noticeable changes 
in Yellowstone geysers and hot springs was "sympathetic" temblors that followed 
the 1992 Landers earthquake in California, hundreds of miles away.

JUDGE ORDERS TRIAL IN POLLY KLAAS SLAYING; COURTS: CHARGES AGAINST RICHARD 
DAVIS, ACCUSED OF KIDNAPING AND KILLING THE SEVENTH-GRADER, COULD LEAD TO THE 
DEATH PENALTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Allen Davis was ordered Friday to stand trial in the abduction and 
murder of Polly Klaas, the shy seventh-grader whose kidnaping last fall 
terrified parents everywhere and spawned an extraordinary search by volunteers 
to find her. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing from 24 witnesses during a three-day preliminary hearing, Sonoma 
County Municipal Judge Robert P. Dale said the evidence created a strong 
suspicion that Davis snatched Polly from her Petaluma bedroom at knifepoint and 
strangled her. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Davis faces 11 criminal charges, including murder, kidnaping, false 
imprisonment and assault with intent to commit a lewd act on a child. The 
murder charge carries four special circumstances. If any of those special 
circumstances are proved at trial, Davis could be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual move that hushed the courtroom, Dale delivered a harsh, 
five-minute monologue summing up his feelings about the notorious case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case leaves many gnawing questions," Dale said. Among them are when and 
how Polly died and whether she was still alive when two sheriff's deputies 
questioned Davis shortly after the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know (the answers)," Dale said. "I don't think any of us knows, 
except for one person. Polly Klaas can't tell us." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale also called Davis' assertion that he kidnaped Polly in a drug-induced 
haze "absurd and totally without credence." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a person who is intoxicated, this is not a person who is 
confused," the judge said, referring to evidence alleging that Davis brought 
pre-cut strips of fabric into Polly's home to bind and gag her and two friends. 
"This is a person who has a plan . . . and continued to carry it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Polly's father, Marc Klaas, sat with his head bowed during Friday's brief 
hearing. After the judge's ruling, he clasped hands with Petaluma Police Sgt. 
Mike Meese, the lead detective in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a shaken Klaas said the week's testimony had been "absolutely awful" to 
listen to. "If I could turn back time I would turn back time, but it's 
impossible to do that," Klaas said. "Polly is dead . . . and nothing will ever 
bring my heart back or fill the emptiness that I feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 39, sat passively through the week's testimony. His attorney, Deputy 
Public Defender Barry Collins, said he was not surprised by the judge's 
findings because the standard of proof that prosecutors must meet at a 
preliminary hearing is low. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said he would consider a plea agreement if the district attorney would 
drop efforts to obtain a death sentence for his client. Prosecutors have said 
that is not an option. 
</P>
<P>
 Polly was kidnaped Oct. 1 from her Petaluma bedroom, where she was hosting a 
sleep-over for two schoolmates. Her body was found two months later after 
Davis, a repeat felon who committed his first crime at the age of 12, was 
arrested and confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 In key testimony this week, Polly's friends identified Davis as the intruder, 
and four other witnesses said a man resembling Davis was outside the Klaas home 
in the hours before the crime. FBI forensics experts linked fibers from Polly's 
clothing and bedroom carpet to those found in Davis' car.

O.C. STUDY SAYS LUMPECTOMIES, MASTECTOMIES EQUALLY EFFECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Hoag Hospital said Friday that its own 10-year study of those with breast 
cancer confirms a UC Irvine study that showed lumpectomy, in which only a 
cancerous tumor is removed, is just as safe and effective as a mastectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoag's study, analyzing the cases of 875 patients between 1980 and 1990, found 
a recurrence of breast cancer in less than 1% of the women in the 10 years 
after lumpectomies with radiation and with mastectomies, in which the entire 
breast is removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Russell Hafer, director of radiation oncology at Hoag Cancer Center, said 
the study also showed that the likelihood that cancer would appear later in 
another part of the body was the same after both surgical procedures, with 89% 
of the women disease-free at five years and 80% disease-free at 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some surgeons have been reluctant to adopt breast-conservation techniques 
because they were skeptical the same results could be achieved as with 
mastectomy," Hafer said.  
</P>
<P>
 The study results have been forwarded to the hospital's general surgical 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCI study, released last month, studied 6,000 Orange County women.

CAMP HOUSING PAROLED RAPIST LOSES FOREST SERVICE PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Forest Service, bending to public pressure, ordered California 
officials Friday to eject paroled serial rapist Melvin Carter and an inmate 
camp from federal forest property in Modoc County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Forest Service revoked the state's permit to use the Modoc National Forest 
land after state officials refused to remove Carter, a notorious parolee whose 
presence at the camp has created an uproar in the nearby community of Alturas, 
in the state's northeast corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extreme action, but Melvin Carter is an extreme criminal," said 
Rep. Wally Herger (R-Rio Oso), who worked with the community to oust Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, 49, has confessed to attacking more than 100 women. When he was 
paroled to the Devil's Garden Conservation Camp in March, nearby residents 
threatened to kill him and a judge tried to banish him. 
</P>
<P>
 The state now has 30 days to remove Carter and 90 days to tear down the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said they will not consider removing Carter until they have 
exhausted administrative appeals. Department of Corrections spokesman Tip 
Kindel said the state has 10 days to seek a stay of the revocation and 45 days 
to appeal to Jack Ward Thomas, head of the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is absolutely nothing in the use permit that restricts anybody from 
being there," Kindel said. " . . . Once we get it into an environment that is 
not so emotionally charged, we will have a better chance of having the issue 
resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Alturas residents said Friday they dread losing business from camp employees 
but still want Carter out of their community. "It is not a matter of getting 
rid of him as much as who are they going to bring in next," said Heather Chase, 
owner of Alturas' Sports Hut. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal permit is held by the state Department of Forestry and Fire 
Protection, and the camp is run by forestry and corrections officials. It has 
about 75 low-risk inmates who clear trails and fight fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter lives there as an employee of the Department of Corrections. Kindel 
said he works about two hours a day repairing radios and telecommunications 
equipment and earning $5 to $20 a month after costs for his food and other 
necessities are deducted.

5 ALLEGED MOLEST VICTIMS, CHURCH REACH SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five men who claimed to have been sexually molested as children by the pastor 
of the Assemblies of God church in Carlsbad have reached an out-of-court 
settlement with the larger church organization for $1.75 million, the 
plaintiff's attorneys said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs filed suit against Rev. Dalton Webber Sr., the former pastor of 
Good Shepherd Assemblies of God Worship Center in Carlsbad, accusing him of 
molesting them on hundreds of occasions between 1976 and 1984.The suit also 
named the Assemblies of God Inc. Church, which the plaintiffs alleged had erred 
in knowingly hiring a pedophile. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his home in Siloan Springs, Ark., Webber declined to comment on the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the Southern California District Council of the Assemblies of 
God Church, based in Costa Mesa, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The five men, two of whom recalled the molestations while in counseling, said 
Webber made them perform various sex acts in his home, his car and at overnight 
youth activities.

SYBERT WAR CHEST FILLED WITH HIS OWN CASH; POLITICS: FORMER WILSON AIDE LENDS 
HIS CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN $430,000 TO BREAK AWAY FROM REPUBLICAN PRIMARY 
RIVALS IN FUND RAISING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Relying heavily on his own funds, businessman Richard Sybert is financially 
overwhelming his opponents in the race for the Republican nomination for the 
politically competitive seat held by U.S. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland 
Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, a former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson who moved to Woodland Hills last 
year, has loaned his campaign $430,000 of the $473,080 that he has raised for 
the June 7 primary, according to campaign reports filed with the Federal 
Election Commission. These records reflect activity through March 31, the close 
of the most recent reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert's closest fund-raising competitor in the 24th District is Robert K. 
Hammer, a Newbury Park investment-banking consultant who had garnered $70,367. 
He loaned himself $61,160 of that total. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have necessarily had to pay some attention to my primary opposition, but I 
don't consider it substantial and I do expect to win the primary," Sybert said. 
"I see my major opponent as Mr. Beilenson in the general election." 
</P>
<P>
 In other San Fernando Valley-area contests, incumbents are running far ahead 
of their would-be challengers in available cash. And few of the lawmakers have 
done much serious fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Democrat Doug Kahn, an Altadena businessman planning a second bid against 
Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), has made headway. He had $93,734 on hand; 
he has loaned his campaign $62,027. But Moorhead has $386,141 in his war chest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of the Southern California recession and pervasive earthquake 
damage, this appears to be the year of the self-financed (and generally 
underfinanced) challenger. It could also be the year of the rematch in three 
Valley-area districts. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, none of the challengers to Reps. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama 
City), Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) or Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles) has shown financial muscle. All three lawmakers are strongly favored 
to win reelection in districts filled with their party's partisans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican race in the 24th Congressional District, which runs from 
Sherman Oaks through the western Valley, out to Malibu and up to Thousand Oaks, 
is the most closely watched. Five Republicans, none especially well-known, are 
squaring off in a low-key contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, who was Wilson's director of planning and research and is now 
president of a small Santa Barbara toy company, has racked up many endorsements 
as well as pumped large sums of his own money into his first-time bid. He said 
he plans to spend $200,000 to $300,000 on numerous campaign mailings and, 
perhaps, radio and cable television advertising as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the Republican primary, commercial real estate broker Emery Shane of 
Woodland Hills reported raising $48,631 this year, including $37,436 that he 
has loaned his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Boos Benhard of Woodland Hills, who owns a media-relations firm, reported 
raising $7,081 this year. He loaned his campaign $10,000 in December and 
another $500 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his own largess, Sybert's fund-raising has been modest as well. He 
brought in $8,000 from political action committees, including $3,000 from a PAC 
representing car dealers nationwide and $2,000 from the Lockheed Employees PAC 
in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park businessman Sang Korman, who poured more than $800,000 of his own 
funds into three previous unsuccessful Republican congressional bids, did not 
file a report. Korman is not waging an active campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two-thirds of Sybert's 43 individual contributions and funds have come 
from outside the district, according to a review of his campaign reports. This 
includes money from the wealthy enclaves of Pasadena, San Marino and Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert spent $150,165 during the first quarter of the year. The largest 
expenditures were made to consultants, particularly the Sacramento firm of 
McNally, Temple & Associates, which handled advertising and mailing costs as 
well as general consulting. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert emphasizes his fund-raising success relative to the record of his 
opponents and insists that many of his contributions came from the 24th 
District. And he said that he had delayed some fund-raising initiatives in the 
wake of the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he acknowledged, "between the earthquake and the new higher tax rates 
that have really dried up a lot of discretionary income and the Southern 
California economy, fund-raising is like pulling teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson cast Sybert's efforts in a less charitable light. "He's failed 
utterly thus far to show he has any real support other than his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer raised only $7,320 in the first three months of 1994. He spent $41,540 
during that period. He reported $10,177 on hand as of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never enough money. Never enough time. Never enough resources," said 
Hammer, who touted his volunteer supporters. "We have made great gains with the 
resources we have. I think that's what people are looking for, not someone 
who's going to buy an election." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has not sought any PAC money because candidates should not accept 
contributions from groups whose interests they may vote on. He said that his 
many years residing in the district -- in contrast to Sybert, who moved there 
last year to launch his candidacy -- and activism in Republican circles will 
overcome his spending disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get into six figures, I think you'll have a credible campaign," Hammer 
said. He predicted he'll be "close to or over that when all is said and done." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, meanwhile, did little fund-raising during the first three months of 
this year. He faces a nominal primary challenge from Scott Gaulke, a Sherman 
Oaks businessman who has run previously as a follower of political extremist 
Lyndon LaRouche. No report was available for Gaulke; candidates who raise or 
spend less than $5,000 are not required to file. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, a nine-term lawmaker, reported that he had $62,142 available. His 
campaign owes him $50,000, which he said he doesn't expect to be repaid. In 
addition, he said he has raised nearly $40,000 since the March 31 reporting 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, the third-ranking Democrat on the influential Rules Committee, 
spent $753,415 to win 56% of the vote in 1992 -- the first time he ran in the 
newly drawn "swing" district. He said he was uncertain how much he'll need for 
the fall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on who wins the Republican primary," Beilenson said. "It depends 
on how much he is likely to have. I tend to be responsive." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, who does not take PAC money, raised a surprisingly large total of 
$786,463 in 1992. The general election campaign is expected to attract a 
considerable flow of contributions as a nationally targeted race. Sybert has 
said he would need to spend $1 million to oust Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead also faces a poorly financed primary challenge. The 10-term lawmaker 
reported that he spent $57,160 during the first three months of the year and 
had nearly seven times that much on hand. Republican Elizabeth Michael, a 
Pasadena businesswoman, reported that she raised $7,227 in the first three 
months of the year. She had loaned her campaign $15,184. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead's contributions included $1,000 each from PACs representing home 
builders, Philip Morris, Sunkist, Viacom International, Transamerica Insurance 
and Anheuser-Busch. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn, who faces two little-known opponents in the Democratic primary, raised 
$24,060 during the first quarter and spent $5,795. Reports were not available 
for Democrats Roger A. Kulpa, a Burbank accounting business owner, and Daniel 
I. Hurst, a Glendale systems analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead outspent Kahn by a lopsided margin of $705,814 to $167,898 in 1992 
yet won only 50% of the vote. He is the senior Republican on the powerful 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, a former Santa Clarita mayor seeking a second term, also faces a 
possible rematch with Democrat James H. Gilmartin, a Saugus attorney who 
received 33% of the vote in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, who ended his initial election campaign owing himself about $200,000, 
reported that he reduced the debt to $130,000 and had $10,742 on hand. He faces 
Sandra Tully, a Lancaster manager/technician, in the Republican primary. No 
campaign report was available for Tully. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon received $3,250 from PACs and $815 from individuals during the first 
three months of the year. He took in $1,000 each from the American Dental PAC 
and the Federal Express PAC. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmartin reported raising $6,017 this year, spending $3,070 and ending the 
first quarter with $2,947 available. He is opposed in the Democratic primary by 
William H. Horning, a Lancaster clerk. No report was available for Horning. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman, who chairs a Foreign Affairs subcommittee, had $126,613 available. His 
contributions include $1,000 from Anheuser-Busch PAC and $500 from the 
Television & Radio PAC. 
</P>
<P>
 His Democratic primary opponents are G. C. (Brodie) Broderson, a Los Angeles 
businessman who previously ran against Berman as a Republican, and Jose P. 
Galvan, a Sylmar librarian and community activist. Fund-raising reports were 
not available for either. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Gary E. Forsch, a Sun Valley businessman who opposed Berman in 
1992, faces primary opposition from Bill Glass, a Sherman Oaks accountant, and 
John A. Furutani, a Los Angeles attorney. Forsch reported that he raised $750 
in 1993, loaned his campaign $13,203 and had $8,151 on hand. His 1994 report 
was not available. 
</P>
<P>
 No reports were on file for the other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman, who chairs the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and 
environment, had $398,244 available. He has a Democratic primary opponent, Jon 
Rappoport, a Los Angeles journalist. Rappoport reported raising $9,172 and had 
$4,800 on hand as of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican primary, Paul Stepanek, a Los Angeles businessman, is 
running against Patrick Regan, a Santa Monica filmmaker. Stepanek raised $5,172 
during the first three months of the year and had $1,040 on hand. No report was 
on file for Regan.

HUNDREDS OF DEAD TURTLES FOUND IN VAN; ANIMALS: AUTHORITIES SAY THE REPTILES 
MAY HAVE BEEN LEFT FOR SEVERAL DAYS. THE VEHICLE'S OWNER SAYS THE CREATURES 
WERE TO HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS IN SANTA BARBARA TO BE EATEN.

<P>
 It was like any other vehicle parked in a West Hills apartment complex. Except 
for the stench. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried and suspicious neighbors Friday asked two workmen on grounds to check 
out the foul smell coming from a white van with a Mexican license plate. 
</P>
<P>
 When the workers opened the unlocked vehicle, they discovered an estimated 
1,000 turtles packed in burlap sacks -- about half of them dead and many others 
suffering from dehydration, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were called to the scene and an investigating team from the Los Angeles 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Southern California 
Humane Society were investigating the reason the reptiles were left in the van. 
Authorities speculate that the turtles may have been left in the vehicle for 
several days because of the presence of flies and maggots.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some are alive, some are dead, some are decomposed. Some heads, arms and legs 
fell off," said SPCA Executive Director Madeline Bernstein, as she helped 
remove the turtles from the van. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the vehicle, Mark Osterholt, said the turtles were left in the 
vehicle for about eight hours while he waited for a driver to come by and 
deliver them to customers in Santa Barbara, where the turtles would eventually 
have been eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Osterholt, who stood by and watched as authorities removed the reptiles from 
his car, was identified by police, but refused to give his name to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the shipment of turtles, believed to be red-eared sliders, was 
delivered to him at his wholesale business in Westminster in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Osterholt refused to disclose where the reptiles came from, other 
than that he had purchased them from farmers in Southern states. The owner 
placed the value of the turtles at $7,000 to $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, this was not the first time the owner has brought turtles to the 
apartment complex. A neighbor who would only identify herself as Ruth said on 
several occasions as she walked her dog, she saw Osterholt running water over 
sacks of reptiles stored in his garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor said that she also had seen a U-Haul truck picking up turtles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein said that SPCA veterinarians will examine the live turtles to 
determine their medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, she said that the SPCA will impound the turtles until officials 
complete their investigation to determine if Osterholt will be charged with 
cruelty to animals or violating laws concerning transporting live animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Osterholt was not arrested or cited, Bernstein said.

RACE ISSUE HEATS UP AT SCHOOL; YOUTH: AT CANYON HIGH, DEPUTIES HAVE BEEN 
BROUGHT IN AFTER CLASHES THAT MAY BE RELATED TO WHITE SUPREMACY. EVENTS LEAD TO 
INTROSPECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The petite girl raised her hand. She had decided to speak out about racism at 
her school, Canyon High in Santa Clarita, where sheriff's deputies were 
summoned this week to calm tensions between white and Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," she said, biting her upper lip. "I don't see any racism here, 
I just don't. Am I really that naive, or what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty junior and senior students -- black, white, Latino and Asian -- who had 
packed into Gary Mast's second-period sociology class to talk about the subject 
gave the full-throated answer in no uncertain terms: 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon High is a school like most other Los Angeles schools: Its student 
parking lot is chock full of speed bumps. On any weekday, the sound of badly 
played wind instruments wafts from the orchestra's practice room. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's something else here that catches the eye and the ear: The 
occasional Confederate flag displayed on student-owned pickup trucks, a 
misguided symbol of white supremacy. And racial slurs uttered in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In a muted suburban throwback to the unrest of the 1960s, the area surrounding 
this placid, tree-lined campus became the scene Wednesday of uniformed deputies 
called in by frustrated school officials to keep the peace. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Friday morning, two white students were suspended after they began 
fighting on school grounds in a racially motivated incident that officials said 
began when one accused the other of consorting with white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
 This predominantly white bedroom community has recently witnessed tense 
standoffs between minority students and a small group of young white 
supremacists, creating a distinct racial fault line that has caused students to 
question their own attitudes toward racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students have chosen to ignore off-campus scuffles Tuesday in which car 
windshields were broken. The violence precipitated a move by sheriff's deputies 
Wednesday to comb streets surrounding the school for groups of students they 
say could signal yet more trouble ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 In a community with a place called Friendly Valley and a street named 
Shangri-La, students say the recent ethnic fireworks have been blown out of 
proportion, representing a decided minority in the way locals look at race. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say the tensions at school mirror the outside community, composed of 
numerous "white-flight" families who have fled the urban and racial hassles of 
the big city. 
</P>
<P>
 Racism bred at home, they say, is brought to campus -- along with skateboards 
and schoolbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Clarita is bigoted, conservative and homophobic," one female student 
told the sociology class. "It's not a nice place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the backdrop of posters lambasting censorship, abortion and suicide, some 
students complained that ethnic slurs were too frequently allowed to go 
unquestioned by teachers at 2,225-student Canyon High School, which is 75% 
white, 20% Latino and 2% black. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the classroom, they say students fall into clearly defined cliques of 
blacks, whites and Latinos. While not entirely exclusive, the blacks hang out 
near a big tree on campus and the Latinos near the entrance to the library -- 
leaving the rest of the campus to the whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other schools, kids hang out together because of the clothes they wear, or 
their hobbies, like skateboarding," one student observed. "But here at Canyon, 
they hang out because of people's skin color." 
</P>
<P>
 Added another: "All the time, in conversations, you hear 'this white guy' or 
'that Mexican girl.' Why can't it just be that guy or that girl?" 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other high schools across the region, and even the country, racial 
tensions are not new to Canyon. Three years ago, a student was stabbed near 
school grounds in what was termed a racial incident. In the past, concerned 
parents have besieged school officials, demanding that steps be taken to ease 
racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the school requires incoming freshman to attend tolerance training 
seminars in which they discuss issues of racism and discrimination, classes 
taught by teacher Gary Mast. 
</P>
<P>
 Mast said Friday that the recent disturbances were not isolated incidents and 
that the entire community needs to deal with the problem through tolerance and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 With a sigh, he added that Santa Clarita was becoming a target for white 
supremacists. "It seems that the white supremacist movement sees this community 
as a place to recruit sympathy," he said. "You see it in the flyers and 
leaflets on campus. They weren't made here. They came from someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
 Mast and students this week fought that propaganda with some of their own, 
creating a large poster they hung at school denouncing racism. Mast said there 
were plans to bring the banner to an upcoming City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the school ground has become a tense place. Michael Onori, a white 
student with blue-dyed hair, said he was recently beaten by a white football 
player who accused him of circulating anti-white supremacy literature on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old sophomore named Bill agreed that students bring to school 
lessons learned at the dinner table. His stepfather, he said, often angers him 
with racist comments thinly veiled as jokes. But he says he doesn't listen to a 
word of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still," he added, "there's some things that bug me. Black people think that 
we whites owe them something. Like, we can create an all-black college but not 
an all-white one, because that would be considered racist. 
</P>
<P>
 "And blacks can come to our neighborhood any time they want. But we can't go 
to South-Central or we'd get killed. It's a double standard." 
</P>
<P>
 School Principal Michael Allmandinger said officials there were troubled by 
the recent violence, but he defended the decision to bring in sheriff's 
deputies as an extra security measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this is a terrible thing," he said of the violence. "It comes out of 
ignorance and intolerance of other people's differences. Kids have to learn 
that they have to get along without fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would hope they learn that lesson by the time they're in high school. 
But, apparently, that's not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Allmandinger said the campus, like others, has seen a growing presence of 
security to keep the peace. "It used to be that we teachers and administrators 
could play security guard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's not possible anymore. We now have seven people who work solely as 
security guards, and that's mostly to keep people off campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Allmandinger said that with discussions of racism taking place in every corner 
of the campus, perhaps the message will get through. 
</P>
<P>
 "But like the drug problem, it comes from home," he said. "Here at school, we 
don't sell drugs and we don't spread racial hatred. We inherit it." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, as she hurried to a first-period class, a white student in blue jeans 
insisted that her school was completely free of racial tension. 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked if she had any black, Asian or Latino friends, she silently 
shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, she was asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because they don't like me. They don't like me because I'm white." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the bell sounded and, running late, she scurried off toward her class.

CHARGES SOUGHT AGAINST GOLDTHWAIT FOR TV STUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire officials are seeking charges against comedian Bobcat Goldthwait, 
alleging he committed misdemeanors when he unexpectedly set his chair on fire 
during a May 6 taping of "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno." 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, there was no permit," said Capt. Bob Reinhardt of the Burbank 
Fire Department. "No one knew he was going to do this. Jay Leno and the other 
guest, Lauren Hutton, could have been seriously injured." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait, a stand-up comedian who played a deranged cop in some of the 
"Police Academy" movies, was being interviewed by Leno when he suddenly stood 
up and set his chair afire using lighter fluid and a long-handled lighter. 
</P>
<P>
 A startled Leno and Hutton threw cups of water on the fire, and Goldthwait sat 
back down on the soaked chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a stupid thing to do," Leno said in an interview Friday before leaving 
for New York, where "The Tonight Show" will be taped next week. "I don't think 
he meant any malice by it. I spoke to him afterward and he was very sorry. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did not understand the magnitude of what he'd done. It was something 
inappropriate getting out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 The show, including the incident, was aired the same night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing something about this because, normally, when we have a program 
with an audience of over 450 people and we have an open-flame device, we have 
stringent controls," Reinhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after setting the chair afire, Reinhardt said, the comedian walked 
toward the audience with an open can of lighter fluid, but he slipped and fell 
before reaching them. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials are seeking two misdemeanor charges against Goldthwait for 
unlawfully causing a fire of property and possessing a flammable device with 
the intent to burn. 
</P>
<P>
 A videotape of the show was submitted as evidence to the district attorney's 
office in Glendale Friday. Deputy Dist. Atty. Barbara Murphy said the case is 
still under investigation and charges, if any, will be filed by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait has pulled unscripted stunts on late-night television shows before. 
</P>
<P>
 A week before his "Tonight Show" appearance, the New York-born comedian 
trashed the set of Arsenio Hall's talk show and spray-painted the set's 
backdrop with the words "Paramount Sucks" in a protest of the cancellation of 
Hall's show. 
</P>
<P>
 Best known for his manic delivery and rasping intake of breath after each 
sentence, Goldthwait angered clowns nationwide with his 1992 movie "Shakes the 
Clown." 
</P>
<P>
 Once, he appeared on stage in Oakland wearing nothing but angel wings, 
sneakers and a fur hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait has declined to discuss "The Tonight Show" stunt, said Tim Anctil, 
a manager for the entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very sorry," Anctil said. "Bobcat never meant to hurt anyone. He was 
trying to be funny. It's not his way to be destructive and harmful. He felt he 
had to outdo what he did on the Arsenio Hall show." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno said Friday that the incident would not keep him from inviting Goldthwait 
back to "The Tonight Show."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; VOLUNTEERS PUT A HOUSE BACK IN ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arriving early and ready to work on their day off, a group of employees from 
Home Depot in Canoga Park repaired a Reseda house damaged in the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first joint effort, Home Depot and Habitat for Humanity, an 
international organization that builds low-income housing, will repair four 
residences in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The first -- a three-bedroom house on Zelzah Avenue that was yellow-tagged 
after the Northridge quake -- was repaired Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Kay Davenport, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and is in a 
wheelchair, said she was thrilled with the repairs. "I think it is marvelous," 
Davenport, 56, said. "It is very difficult for me to ask for help, but when I 
did, all these volunteers didn't make me feel ashamed. If you ask me, that is 
real charity." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees of the giant home-improvement store are donating the labor to repair 
earthquake damage for people in need, while the store is donating building 
materials and the organization is coordinating construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are repairing homes that are unlivable and need to be remodeled," said 
Janice Hayward, spokeswoman for Home Depot. "And it is up to the individual 
employee to donate the time they want, but they really enjoy working on the 
homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport, who gets by on $700 a month in Social Security and disability 
payments, said she would not have been able to pay for the repairs, estimated 
at $72,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I have no money left at the end of the month for groceries and 
prescriptions," Davenport said. 
</P>
<P>
 The house was built during World War II by a building contractor for his 
family. Only quality materials were used, Davenport said, including 
hand-painted light fixtures and woodworking along the ceiling and the kitchen 
cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Depot employees replaced broken windows, tore away 50-year-old pine 
paneling and sealed a gap in the wall where the fireplace used to be. They also 
plan to build a wheelchair ramp for the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the guys' day off and they are here," volunteer Tommy Ahern said. "That 
says it all." 
</P>
<P>
 A wooden fence was recently erected where a cinder-block wall stood alongside 
the house Davenport has lived in for more than 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing off her new wooden fence, Davenport said: "My fancy new fence is just 
beautiful. To me, it is like a work of art. I like to come out and just stare 
at it." JEANNETTE REGALADO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; PLANNERS CONSIDER EXPANSION OF PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After hearing comments for and against the proposal this week, the Calabasas 
Planning Commission is expected to decide June 2 whether to allow the expansion 
of a planned office and retail center to include a cinema complex and more 
shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of division in the community over this," said Planning 
Commissioner Allan Cooper."Some people would like to be able to walk to the 
shops and restaurants, and others are worried about the traffic and other

 About 40 residents testified about the Calabasas Park Centre project at the 
Planning Commission meeting Thursday night. The meeting was moved from City 
Hall to the A. E. Wright Middle School gymnasium to accommodate about 200 
spectators, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 As approved by Los Angeles County supervisors in 1989, the 
1.5-million-square-foot Ahmanson/Kilroy project south of Calabasas Road between 
Park Granada and Parkway Calabasas would include up to 50,000 square feet of 
retail space. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago, faced with sluggish demand for office space, the developer 
asked the city of Calabasas to allow 150,000 square feet of shops and 
restaurants and possibly a cinema complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will hold another public hearing on the project June 2 
before considering a recommendation, said Planning Director Steve Harris. After 
that, the City Council will hold its own hearings on the matter. KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; FIRED PRINCIPAL FILES CIVIL RIGHTS LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Burbank High School Principal Keiko Hentell has filed suit in U.S. 
District Court, charging that the Burbank School District, Board of Education 
and superintendent violated her civil rights when she was removed from her job 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit filed Thursday, Hentell claims she was demoted and transferred 
from the school because she is Japanese American and encouraged minority groups 
on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always denied that was any consideration," Burbank school board 
President Elena Hubbell said Friday, after hearing of the suit. "We've never 
made any decision based on race or gender." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleges the board's 
decision in February not to renew her contract, which was due to expire at the 
end of June, was racially motivated. She also charges that Supt. Arthur Pierce 
reassigned her to other duties at the beginning of March because she refused to 
stop a Latino group from having access to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentell is asking for her principal's job back and an undetermined amount in 
damages from the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce referred all questions about the lawsuit to Richard Currier, attorney 
for the school district. Currier did not return phone calls Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we are on very solid ground," said Hubbell, who denied allegations 
that Hentell lost her job as principal because she is a Japanese-American 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a working woman. I would never allow something like that to happen," said 
Hubbell, a local realtor. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit cites a memo by Pierce that Hentell's work with minority and 
ethnic groups on campus and in the community had "caused some members of your 
staff, some members of the Board of Education, and some members of the 
community at large, to be concerned that the traditional population served by 
Burbank High School is being overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hubbell also denied that the action against Hentell had anything to do 
with her work with minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always said many of those groups were there before she came," Hubbell 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've never discouraged them -- we encouraged them. I've always said that if 
the students initiate it and the kids have an interest in it, I don't have a 
problem with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hentell's removal from her job as principal prompted protests during school 
board meetings and at a Burbank High School rally. Letters of objection were 
also written by representatives of several local human rights and ethnic 
groups. ED BOND

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PIONEER RECREATION AREA STAFFER RETIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first National Park Service employee in the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation Area retired this month, 15 years after he helped establish 
a park that stretches from Griffith Park to Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 William Webb, 60, who served as assistant superintendent of the recreation 
area, said the toughest part of his job was the first park's initial few months 
in 1979, when he and former Supt. Robert Chandler faced opposition from many 
residents of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came into a place where a lot of people didn't understand the intent of a 
park," Webb said. "They thought we were coming in to buy up all the homes. We 
had to talk to a lot of people and let them know that we looked at them as good 
neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the arrival in 1979 of Webb and Chandler, who left several years after 
the park was established, the park staff has grown from two to about 80 and the 
National Park Service has bought 21,000 acres of land for public use. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said some of his most cherished moments in the park include the visits of 
children from East and South-Central Los Angeles. Some of the youngsters had 
never left their neighborhoods before. 
</P>
<P>
 "The excitement that comes across the faces of those schoolkids is something," 
Webb said. "A lot of them would not have the opportunity to go to larger parks. 
So this is their Yosemite or their Sequoia." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb retired on May 3, after 30 years in the National Park Service. His tenure 
included a post as general superintendent for the Virgin Islands National Park 
Group. He plans to move to Kentucky in September with his wife, Caroleen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hate losing this man," said National Park Service spokeswoman Jean Bray. 
"Not only was he the continuity from the first days of the recreation area, but 
he was involved with all the outside organizations and added good character to 
the park." KURT PITZER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; CONCERT TO AID CHURCH HIT BY EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a musical show of Christian solidarity, members of a Shadow Hills church 
will gather to sing and raise money for another congregation, whose North 
Hollywood sanctuary was shaken to its foundations by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage from the Jan. 17 temblor left the main worship hall of the First 
Presbyterian Church a shambles, and the small congregation, about 140 of whom 
attend services on an average Sunday, facing a $1-million bill to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 A May 22 benefit concert of original Christian music by the group All God's 
Children will not generate enough money to shore up the church's sagging roof 
and repair cracked walls, but the musicians hope to offer moral support while 
raising some funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that it (music) is a gift that we've been given, and we like to give 
it back," said group member Carol Browning, who attends the Shadow Hills 
Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctuary was red-tagged after the quake, but then inspectors decided it 
might be repairable, said the church's pastor, the Rev. John Moody. But a 
repair job looks as if it would carry a price tag as high as replacement, Moody 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another cheaper -- but still costly -- option would be to tear down the 
sanctuary and remodel another building on the church's small campus to take the 
place of the main sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've received money from congregations throughout the United States," Moody 
said, but other small churches are not rich either.  
</P>
<P>
 The donations so far total about $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked how his congregation would raise the necessary funds, Moody said, 
"I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The church belongs to the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America, 
an umbrella organization that sometimes offers congregations low-interest 
loans, but Moody said he didn't know if the larger body would underwrite a 
$1-million loan for such a small congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, though, he's concerning himself with the planned evening of 
music and the fellowship offered by another church. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit concert, featuring musicians Browning, Pamela Brownlee and Bob 
Marlowe, will be presented at 7 p.m. at Caldwell Hall on the damaged church's 
campus, 11640 Hesby St., North Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 Admission is $10, $5 for those 18 and under, and a maximum of $25 per family.

<P>
 Responding to an increase in case filings throughout Los Angeles County, the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Court is opening a court facility in the San Fernando Valley, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new branch, scheduled to open in 1995 at a yet-to-be determined location, 
will handle the area between Kern County to the north, Malibu and Studio City 
to the south, Palmdale and North Hollywood to the east, and Ventura County to 
the west, said spokeswoman Wendy Webster. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Bankruptcy Court Judges Arthur Greenwald, Geraldine Mund, Kathleen 
Lax and their staff have already begun handling cases in the area, Webster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The site will be the fifth bankruptcy court in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court's 
Central District of California, which handles more filings than any other 
district in the nation. The other four branches are in Santa Barbara, Downtown 
Los Angeles, Santa Ana and San Bernardino. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

 A 13-year-old Walter Reed Middle School student placed second out of 224 
contestants in a national math competition in Washington, D.C., Friday, winning 
a $6,000 scholarship for college. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Shulman, an eighth-grader from Valley Village, competed against 
students from all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, 
Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the annual MATHCOUNTS competition.More than 
350,000 students nationwide participated in the contest, which is sponsored by 
CNA Insurance Cos. 
</P>
<P>
 The contestants, who advance to the national competition by winning local and 
state competitions, must answer questions individually and with their teams, 
both orally and on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael took first place on the written round, where students must solve 30 
problems in 40 minutes using algebra, geometry and probability. "It's a 
wonderful honor," he said. "I feel tired, energetic, confused and exhilarated. 
I've never had people from the press ganging up on me like this." SUSAN BYRNES

 The hospitals will operate under a two-campus structure, with the San Fernando 
facility, 700 Chatsworth Drive, specializing in psychiatric care, and the 
Panorama City facility, 14850 Roscoe Blvd., providing full primary health care. 
</P>

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; RESIDENTS OPPOSE BRIDGE-WIDENING

<P>
 A homeowners group is opposing the proposed widening of the Tujunga Avenue 
bridge over the Los Angeles River, saying that it will increase traffic, 
encourage speeders and change the pedestrian-friendly character of the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is in dire financial straits," said Tony Lucente, president of the 
Studio City Residents Assn."They don't need to be spending money on this."  
</P>
<P>
 In a letter faxed Friday to the Los Angeles Department of Public Works, 
Lucente challenged a city report's finding that the project is necessary and 
would not worsen the area's traffic situation. City environmental associate 
John Berg said he will include residents' comments -- and address them -- in 
the environmental impact report that he will present to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Public Works wants to widen the bridge from two to four 
lanes to relieve traffic bottlenecks it says are now occurring at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lucente said there is no congestion at the bridge, and that downzoning of 
Tujunga Avenue between the Ventura Freeway and Ventura Boulevard indicates that 
traffic will not significantly worsen in the future. KAY HWANGBO

 A Glendale man was killed and two others were seriously injured when his car 
crashed into a car making a left turn into a driveway, authorities said Friday.

<P>
 Eric Nikoian, 25, died Thursday at the scene of the 9:50 p.m. accident in the

 Nikoian was a passenger in a car driven by 18-year-old Nazaret Abovian of

 Another passenger, Lyla Bennett, 21, of Glendale, also remained hospitalized 
at North Hollywood Medical Center, where she was treated for a fractured right 
wrist and broken legs, said a hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car making the left turn, Guadalupe Jose Gutierrez, 26, of 
North Hollywood, was not hurt in the collision. He was not cited. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that Gutierrez was driving northbound on Whitsett Avenue near 
Vanowen Street when he made a left turn into a driveway. A southbound car 
rammed into Gutierrez's car and crashed into two parked vehicles. CHAU LAM

COUPLE SUE INSURER OVER ART DAMAGE; COURTS: GARY AND DONNA FREEDMAN CLAIM 
ENCINO FIRM SOLD THEM ALL-RISK POLICY BUT REFUSES TO PAY $2.5-MILLION 
EARTHQUAKE CLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Santa Monica couple who thought they had insured their multimillion-dollar 
art collection have filed a lawsuit against an Encino insurance agency and a 
giant insurer for failing to pay a $2.5-million claim for earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary and Donna Freedman filed the suit in Los Angeles Superior Court last week 
alleging that American Business Insurance Brokers Los Angeles Inc. sold them an 
all-risk policy for their collection of paintings and ceramics through 
Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., which has refused their claim. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether the policy excluded earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fireman's Fund and American Business officials declined to comment on the 
lawsuit this week. Both companies are defendants in the suit, which alleges 
negligence, bad faith and breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedmans said they were surprised when Fireman's Fund denied their claim 
to cover 15 pieces of their collection, including a $2.3-million Roy 
Lichtenstein oil painting titled "Expressionist Head." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Freedman, a Santa Monica attorney, said the five-by-six-foot painting 
suffered several scrapes and damage to its canvas when the wire it was hanging 
from on their living room wall broke during the Northridge earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Freedman said he was shocked when an insurance adjuster from Fireman's Fund 
said he had no coverage.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible for me to express the feeling I had on that Saturday when 
they told me I had no coverage," Freedman said. "It's outrageous to me what 
they've done." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, Freedman called his broker at American Business and 
was told that his policy did not exclude earthquake damage. The agency sent a 
letter to Fireman's Fund stating as much. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, on March 1, Fireman's Fund denied the claim, the lawsuit states. 
Freedman said he was told by the company that an amendment had been added to 
his policy excluding earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedman said American Business apparently discovered a copy of the amendment 
to the 1992 policy in their files when the dispute erupted. Freedman contended 
he had never been told it existed until after he filed his claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have such an exclusion in our copy of the policy and even if we did, 
one was never issued with the 1994 policy," said Bruce A. Friedman, an attorney 
representing the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said the couple switched insurers in 1992 from Lloyd's of London 
after an agent from American Business told them they could acquire a better 
policy through Fireman's Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedmans describe the conduct by Fireman's Fund in their lawsuit as 
despicable, malicious, fraudulent, oppressive and outrageous for failing to pay 
on their claim. They accuse American Business of negligence for selling them a 
policy that was substantially different then their previous policy with Lloyd's 
of London, which covered quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedmans are seeking $2.5 million plus an unspecified amount of punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Freedman said he and his wife purchased the Lichtenstein painting from a 
New York art dealer for $75,000 in 1980, when it first came out and they were 
starting their art collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years the painting's value grew, as have many pieces by Lichtenstein, 
whose works have been auctioned for as much as $6 million. Freedman said he has 
had the painting, which he describes as the centerpiece of his $3.2-million art 
collection, insured for the last 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Freedman said his premiums through Fireman's Fund for the 
collection were quoted at $6,400, but he said he is now shopping for a new 
insurer to avoid a repeat of the situation he and his wife find themselves in. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're thinking, thank goodness I have insurance for my valuable possession," 
Freedman said. "Then to be told that you don't . . . it's a big loss."

MAN RECEIVES 128-YEAR TERM IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD RAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Noting the viciousness of the crimes, a judge sentenced a man to more than 128 
years in prison Friday for raping two neighbors who were attacked on 
consecutive nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Daniel Artamenko, 24, was convicted last month on 19 felony counts -- 
including rape, anal penetration and forced oral copulation -- stemming from 
attacks on June 30 and July 1 in a North Hollywood apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the bad guys got put away, and that's a good thing," the second victim 
said after the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 That woman, who is now 30, read an emotional statement that detailed her 
recovery after the assault and her inability to get over the fear that has 
gripped her. The only thing she hasn't been able to understand is why he 
attacked her, the woman said, looking directly at Artamenko. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Darlene Schempp allowed the defendant to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why," a shackled Artamenko said. "I was just sick in my head. . 
. . I can only say I'm sorry. I would take it all back if I could." 
</P>
<P>
 "Shame on you," the victim said. "You can go to hell." 
</P>
<P>
 The first woman who was attacked, now 44, was emotionally unable to attend 
Friday's sentencing, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven J. Ipsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking almost an hour to detail each of the 19 counts, Schempp acknowledged 
that Artamenko suffered from emotional problems, but she said the lengthy 
prison term was warranted by his "violent conduct, indicating he is a danger to 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 The total sentence handed down was 128 years and 8 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Patricia A. Andreoni-Alcazar said Artamenko never intended to 
hurt anyone -- even though he was convicted of using a knife during the second 
assault. She said alcohol was a contributing factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Artamenko was arrested after the first victim heard screams coming from a 
neighboring apartment and summoned police. The woman who was attacked on the 
first night identified Artamenko as her assailant, and authorities found keys 
from the first victim's apartment in a pair of jeans found near the second 
woman's apartment.

MINORITIES, WOMEN GET MOST QUAKE CONTRACTS; BUSINESS: PUBLIC WORKS REPORT SHOWS 
SUCH COMPANIES HAVE RECEIVED 63% OF CITY SPENDING ON DEBRIS-CLEANUP JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A majority of the debris cleanup and building demolition work contracted out 
by the city of Los Angeles since the Northridge quake has been done by minority 
and women-run companies, according to a city report released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the city's Public Works Department said the cleanup program has 
paid out about $10.2 million in contracts, or 63% of the total spent so far, to 
companies owned by minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, 78% of the quake cleanup money has gone to firms based in Los 
Angeles County, according to the report. Nearly half of the contract money went 
to companies within the city of Los Angeles, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was drafted by Public Works officials partly in response to 
criticism by some city officials, who predicted the city-managed cleanup 
program would not employ enough local minority and female-owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Richard Alarcon, Richard Alatorre and Mike Hernandez voted against 
putting the cleanup program under city management primarily because they 
believed private firms could manage the program at a lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also argued that because of complex contracting guidelines, the city 
would probably employ fewer local and minority-run contractors than would 
private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Friday's report did not seem to appease the program's critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, who represents the northeast San Fernando Valley, said he was not 
impressed, pointing out that minority firms received an even larger percentage 
of the cleanup contracts after the 1992 riots. That cleanup program was managed 
by private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 90% of the demolition and cleanup work done after the riots was 
awarded to minority and women-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alarcon added that he was pleased to learn that 78% of the quake debris 
business went to local companies. 
</P>
<P>
 At Alarcon's request, the City Council approved a proposal last week to 
consider letting private firms oversee portions of the cleanup program. Alarcon 
said that if adopted, the proposal would show whether private firms could 
manage the program more cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
 When Alatorre was shown the Public Works report on the cleanup program, he 
simply said, "We could have done better under the other way" and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Charles Dickerson III, president of the Public Works Board of 
Commissioners, said he was pleased with the numbers. "I think we have done an 
exemplary job at hiring minority firms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager of the city's cleanup program, Andres Santamaria, said he is 
trying to hire as many local and minority contractors as possible. But, he 
added, the number of minority and women-owned firms that qualify for the 
cleanup program are limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hiring as many minority firms as are applying," Santamaria said. "I'm 
not excluding anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city must abide by federal and local guidelines that prohibit the 
city from hiring only firms based within the city of Los Angeles and only firms 
owned by women or minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether those same guidelines would have been set for private consultants 
remains unclear, according to Santamaria. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Works report said the city has spent $16.1 million on contracts for 
debris cleanup as well as fencing and demolition of severely damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The contracts have been paid out in the following percentages: 
</P>
<P>
 *36.9% to firms owned by white males; 
</P>
<P>
 *27.6% to firms owned by African American males; 
</P>
<P>
 *12.9% to firms owned by Latino males; 
</P>
<P>
 *10% to firms owned by white females; 
</P>
<P>
 *12.6% to firms owned by Native Americans, Asians, Portuguese and Pacific 
Islanders.

ROGAN'S 2 GOP RIVALS ABANDON BIDS; POLITICS: PETER REPOVICH AND JULIA WU PULL 
OUT OF THE RACE AGAINST THE NEW REPUBLICAN ASSEMBLYMAN, WHO SUCCEEDED PAT 
NOLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two GOP candidates disclosed Friday they will suspend their campaigns against 
fellow Republican James Rogan who was elected only 10 days ago to fill the 
state Assembly seat held by Pat Nolan until he resigned in February. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the two, Los Angeles Police Officer Peter Repovich, who raised $350,000 
to run, not only suspended his campaign but also endorsed Rogan and retracted 
several of the criticisms he had made about his rival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not wish to be a spoiler or hurt our cause," Repovich said at a news 
conference with Rogan on Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan was elected in a May 3 special election to serve out the seven months 
remaining in Nolan's term. Nolan resigned Feb. 18 after pleading guilty to one 
count of racketeering and is currently serving a jail term. 
</P>
<P>
 Also bowing out of the June 7 primary election is Republican Julia Wu, a 
member of the Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees. A dejected Wu, 
however, said she was not yet ready to take the next step and endorse Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I've had a setback and I'm very disappointed," Wu 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wu and Repovich were contacted in recent days by GOP state Assembly 
leader Jim Brulte of San Bernardino and urged to drop out of the race to ensure 
party unity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't persuade them to do anything," Brulte said Friday. "Both Julia Wu 
and Peter Repovich are dedicated Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 The decisions by Repovich and Wu leave Rogan, a former Glendale Municipal 
Court judge, facing a suddenly dramatically weakened field of challengers in 
the June 7 GOP primary for the 43rd Assembly District seat. Repovich was the 
best-financed of Rogan's rivals and Wu the best-known. 
</P>
<P>
 Now instead of five challengers, Rogan will effectively face only three, David 
Wallis, Joseph Pietroforte and Louis Morelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan was sworn in Monday to serve out the rest of Nolan's term, which expires 
Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Repovich and Wu are taking themselves out of that contest, their 
names will remain on the ballot. County election officials said the ballots 
have been printed and cannot be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 At Friday's news conference, Repovich, a Hollywood-based community relations 
officer with the LAPD, said he would do whatever he could to promote Rogan's 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 During Friday's briefing, Repovich had to backpedal on his previous charges 
that Rogan's Republican credentials were dubious because he had only converted 
to the GOP in 1988 after being a Democratic Party activist for many years and 
that Rogan's conservative Christian values would jeopardize the ability of 
Republicans to hold on to the 43rd District seat against a moderate Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Jim Rogan is the best man to beat the Democrats in November," said 
Repovich, who characterized his prior criticisms as typical statements made in 
the "heat of the battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan said he was extremely pleased with Repovich's decision and welcomed his 
support. He had no comment on Wu's decision. "I haven't spoken with her about 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the sudden show of GOP unity looked to be a setback of sorts to the 
chances of a Democrat winning the 43rd District seat in November. Consultants 
for former assistant U. S. Atty. Adam Schiff, who is the likely Democratic 
nominee, had previously said it was hoped that a divisive GOP primary would 
soften up the Republican candidate in November. Now that divisiveness appears 
to have evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Schiff on Friday was putting another interpretation on the latest 
events. "I'm just glad I won't have to face the possibility of running against 
Repovich in November," Schiff said. "Rogan will make a much better opponent for 
me than Repovich, who was a moderate, pro-choice Republican." 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff claims that Repovich's moderate positions would have cut into his own 
base, while Rogan, who has some strongly held conservative views, will give him 
a chance to exclusively woo the middle-of-the-road voter. Rogan, for example, 
opposes abortion and gun controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff on Friday also began turning up the heat by attacking Rogan's 
acceptance of the recently enacted 37% pay hike for legislators. "That was a 
very inauspicious start," the Democratic candidate said. "The timing is 
especially bad when we don't have a balanced budget and our schools are 
underfunded." Schiff said he would not have accepted the raise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrat also charged that Rogan's acceptance of the increase signaled a 
flip-flop of sorts. During the special election campaign, Rogan had noted that 
going from a judge to the Assembly would entail a financial sacrifice because 
-- at the time -- the salary for a Municipal Court judge was $95,000, while the 
pay for an Assembly member averaged about $75,000, including a $52,000 fixed 
salary and a $101-a-day stipend for each day the Legislature is in session. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the 37% pay hike, granted by an independent panel a week ago, the pay 
for lawmakers will hit about $100,000. "It's very ironic that after Rogan made 
such a great fanfare about the financial sacrifice he'd be making in going to 
Sacramento when, in fact, he's gotten a pay increase," Schiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan scoffed at the notion of refusing to accept the pay. "I suspect that the 
people of the 43rd District would prefer that I spent the money to feed myself 
and my family rather than turning it over to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown," 
Rogan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman said it is his understanding that the pay hike funds, if they 
are not accepted by the members, will not be returned to the state's General 
Fund, but to a fund overseen by the Assembly Rules Committee, which Brown 
controls.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; $500,000 IN JEWELRY STOLEN FROM SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four men robbed an Antelope Valley jewelry store Friday of diamond rings, 
bracelets and necklaces worth $500,000, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, two of them armed with handguns, stole more than 800 items from 
Barry's Jewelers in the Target Plaza on West Avenue K about 11:30 a.m., said 
Deputy Will Roemermann of the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The jewelry was taken along with $200 in cash, he said. The men drove off in a 
white Jeep Cherokee with Arizona license plates, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 No employees were hurt in the robbery and no customers were in the store, 
Roemermann said. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness wrote down the car's license plate number and gave it to police, he 
said, but no suspects have been arrested.

 Two of the four people suspected of being involved in a five-month 
smash-and-grab crime wave that hit about 80 Newhall businesses pleaded guilty 
to burglary-related charges this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Allen Pitchford, 28, of Newhall, pleaded guilty Thursday to two counts 
of burglary and is expected to be sentenced to a three-year term on May 26, 
according to the district attorney's office in Newhall.The action came two days 
after Gilbert Noriega, 38, of Newhall, pleaded guilty to similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Thursday, Javier Noriega, 27, also of Newhall, was charged with four 
counts of burglary and one charge of attempted burglary. He is scheduled to be 
arraigned on May 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say $50,000 worth of cash and property was taken and $30,000 in 
damage was caused between December and April in the crime wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Burglars used rocks, bricks or chunks of concrete to break the glass doors or 
windows of 80 Newhall businesses and took money, merchandise and sometimes cash 
registers. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing is scheduled for June 15 for the fourth suspect in the case, 
Adrianne Donna Myers, 27, of Valencia, authorities said. DOUGLAS ALGER

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN ON TRIAL FOR SETTING WOMAN AFLAME

<P>
 Testimony began Friday in the trial of a Val Verde man accused of setting his 
ex-girlfriend on fire after pouring gasoline on her, with attorneys focusing on 
his state of mind during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for both sides agree that Johnny Mack Finney, 39, emptied a two-liter 
plastic bottle of gasoline on Janice Johnson, 31, at her Val Verde home Aug. 1, 
1993, and used a cigarette lighter to ignite the gas in front of her three 
children. But the prosecution claims that Finney intended to kill her, while 
Deputy Public Defender Howard Waco describes Finney as a troubled person who 
let an argument get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "His intent was to fill a need . . . to control her -- to gain her respect, to 
frighten her -- but not to kill her," Waco told jurors during his opening 
statement in Superior Court in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Finney abused drugs and alcohol, making his thinking unclear during the 
attack, Waco said.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Jonas brought Johnson before jurors during his opening 
argument to show the massive scarring inflicted to her upper body by the 
flames, which consumed most of her right ear and has left her with restricted 
use of her right arm. She suffered life-threatening second- and third-degree 
burns over about 25% of her body. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted her to suffer," Jonas said. "You will hear lots of testimony about 
comments and threats he made in the two weeks prior to this incident." 
</P>
<P>
 Finney abused Johnson during much of the four years they dated, Jonas said. 
The couple has two children who were 2 years and 10 months old at the time of 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonas also introduced the jury to Johnson's 15-year-old son, Roderick Spencer, 
who witnessed the attack. The prosecutor said he hopes to make Johnson and her 
son feel more at ease when they testify -- and keep jurors from being 
distracted by Johnson's injuries -- but Waco condemned the tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district attorney calls this an insidious crime," he said. "The only 
thing I find insidious is displaying a 14- or 15-year-old boy and a woman like 
she's a sideshow freak. . . . I'm not disputing that she suffered grievous 
injury." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, in an interview outside the courtroom, said she believes jealousy 
over her ending the couple's four-year relationship caused the attack. "He told 
me if I couldn't belong to him, than I couldn't belong to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was on welfare and worked part-time as a house cleaner before the 
attack, but is now disabled and unable to work. She has moved from Val Verde 
since the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution's first witness, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Douglas 
Schoenborn, testified that he and two other people in his patrol car spotted 
Finney about two miles away from Johnson's house soon after the attack. Finney 
surrendered immediately, saying, "I wanted to kill myself, too," as deputies 
recovered a dull knife he had apparently used to inflict minor stab wounds to 
his neck, stomach and hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Finney is in custody in lieu of $1 million bail on charges of attempted 
murder, assault with a deadly weapon and spousal abuse. He faces life in prison 
if convicted.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; SAN FERNANDO MISSION MONSIGNOR A FAN OF FAREWELLS SET IN 
STONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was distressing for an acquaintance who happened upon the gravestone of 
Msgr. Francis J. Weber, who, the last she knew, was alive and well and working 
at San Fernando Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The grave marker on a grassy knoll at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City bears 
Weber's name and this data: 
</P>
<P>
 Born 1933, Ordained 1959. Priest-Archivist-Historian.  
</P>
<P>
 The nun who telephoned Weber was pleasantly surprised to learn that he is 
alive, but she was confused.  
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't see a death date, did you?" Weber teased. 
</P>
<P>
 The wry denizen of San Fernando Mission insists he's not trying to learn what 
people really think of him before he dies. 
</P>
<P>
 He just wanted to write his own epitaph. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides an obituary in the local newspaper, about the only monument left on 
planet Earth by the great majority of people is a flat, rectangular gravestone 
marking the location of their burial," Weber said. At 61, Weber, who celebrates 
Masses daily at the mission and writes a weekly column for the Los Angeles 
archdiocesan newspaper, hardly has one foot in the grave. 
</P>
<P>
 But he does set foot in a lot of graveyards. "Whenever I go to a new place, I 
always check out the local cemetery," Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since he worked summers as a gravedigger in Los Angeles to finance his 
education in the 1950s, Weber has been drawn to tombstones in older communities 
around the country and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can learn a lot about the history of an area just by reading the 
tombstones," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a hobby, Weber began collecting the more interesting epitaphs, especially 
those marking the decedent's passing with wit and whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Boot Hill in Tombstone, Ariz., is famous for its clever grave markers. One of 
Weber's favorites is: 
</P>
<P>
 Here lies Lester Moore.  
</P>
<P>
 Four slugs from a .44.  
</P>
<P>
 No Les. No Moore.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of death inspired other epitaphs as well, Weber said. One stone in 
Schenectady,Y., explained: "He got a fish-bone in his throat, And then he sang 
an angel's note."  
</P>
<P>
 In Medway, Mass., an epitaph read: 
</P>
<P>
 Under this stone, this piece of clay  
</P>
<P>
 Lies Uncle Peter Daniels  
</P>
<P>
 Who too early in the month of May  
</P>
<P>
 Took off his winter flannels  
</P>
<P>
 Anne Hopewell was remembered thusly in Enosburg, Vt.: 
</P>
<P>
 Here lies the body of beloved Anna  
</P>
<P>
 Done to death by a fresh banana  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the fruit that laid her low  
</P>
<P>
 But the skin of the thing that made her go.  
</P>
<P>
 But the pronouncement on a gravestone could also give critics their final 
shot, Weber said. For instance, a granite slab in Hatfield, Mass., read: 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath this stone a lump of clay  
</P>
<P>
 Lies Arabella Young  
</P>
<P>
 Who on the 21st of May  
</P>
<P>
 Began to hold her tongue.  
</P>
<P>
 In the churchyard in Woolwich, England, Weber said, "is a very beautifully 
carved marker" with a crushing farewell: 
</P>
<P>
 Sacred to the memory of Major James Brush, Royal Artillery, who was killed by 
the accidental discharge of a pistol by his orderly, 14th April, 1831. Well 
done, good and faithful servant.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The comments sometimes pertained to the community as much as to the person in 
the grave, Weber said -- such as one he found in Aberdeen, Scotland: 
</P>
<P>
 Here lies the bones of Elizabeth Charlotte  
</P>
<P>
 Born a virgin, died a harlot  
</P>
<P>
 She was a virgin at seventeen  
</P>
<P>
 A remarkable thing in Aberdeen.  
</P>
<P>
 The priest said that today's smaller grave markers have made epitaphs a thing 
of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen any epitaphs on tombstones that date within the last 50 or 60 
years," Weber said. "They list mostly the birth and death dates, and maybe the 
names of the mother and father." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he said, leaving the marker's wording to relatives or others can 
result in inaccurate or inappropriate inscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber, interviewed as he stood over his future grave, admitted that his small 
marker has little room to squeeze in any more information -- such as the year 
of death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody cares when you died," he commented, perhaps allowing modesty to 
contradict his calling as an archivist-historian. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what old-style epitaph he might choose if space permitted, Weber said he 
would probably quote Father Junipero Serra, the mission pioneer: 
</P>
<P>
 In California is my life and there, God willing, I hope to die.  
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, father. How about something on the order of: 
</P>
<P>
 Here lies a history-loving priest  
</P>
<P>
 Roamed graveyards often to say the least  
</P>
<P>
 Wrote his own marker, hardly a wonder  
</P>
<P>
 Writer gets last word while six feet under.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 3.2% IN HART DISTRICT CHOOSE NEW SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One in every 31 students attending high school or junior high here this fall 
has chosen to go to a different campus under the state's new open enrollment 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 About 355 of the 11,000 students enrolled at William S. Hart Union High School 
District's eight campuses have asked to go to different schools. The district 
includes all of Santa Clarita's public high schools and junior high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 California open enrollment allows students to attend any campus in a public 
school district they want. The program begins with the 1994-95 school year and 
coincides with Hart district officials redrawing their attendance boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students will attend new campuses because the district has redrawn its 
attendance boundaries with the opening of Valencia High School in Valencia and 
La Mesa Junior High School in Canyon Country. Only students in the lower grades 
will attend the new schools in September -- seventh-graders at the junior high 
and ninth- and 10th-graders at the high school. 
</P>
<P>
 More students asked to switch campuses -- about 3.2% of the population -- than 
school officials had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students who would not have attended new schools this fall because of the 
change in the district's attendance boundaries elected to switch under open 
enrollment. Others who would have attended a different school because of the 
boundary change elected to stay where they were because the school was closer 
to home.  
</P>
<P>
 The number of students who decided to switch campuses is "probably a little 
higher than other places that are implementing school choice for the first 
time, although I consider it low overall," Supt. Walt Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the transfers -- 288 high school students and 67 junior high students 
-- have been accommodated, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 92 students who would have attended a more distant school 
because of the boundary change have elected to transfer back to their old 
campus. School officials gave these students priority in choosing schools over 
those taking advantage of the open enrollment plan. Although changing school 
attendance boundaries is invariably controversial, some parental concerns were 
eased with open enrollment available as an extra option. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hart district planned to conduct a lottery if too many students had asked 
to transfer. More coverage of the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys appears on 
B12, 13.

EXPERIENCE NECESSARY TO LAKERS; PRO BASKETBALL: AFTER DECADES OF HIRING ROOKIE 
COACHES, THEY FILL THEIR LATEST VACANCY WITH HARRIS, 56. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Dunleavy didn't want it. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Pfund couldn't keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson didn't need it. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for the fourth time in four years, the Lakers have a new coach in the job 
once considered among the most highly coveted in sports. After going with 
rookie coaches as they have back to the days of Bill Sharman, on Friday the 
Lakers tied their future to a white-haired, 56-year-old veteran, Del Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, who has eight years of head-coaching experience in the NBA, was signed 
to a multiyear deal, believed to be for three years for a total of $1.5 million 
to $2 million. No decision has been made on assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson announced at the end of the season that his 16-game flirtation with 
the job had been nothing more than that, that he wouldn't be back. Rick Pitino 
of Kentucky, Roy Williams of Kansas and Gary Williams of Maryland were all 
prominently mentioned. But Laker owner Jerry Buss insists it was Harris from 
the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "Del has been our first choice for coach for a very long time," Buss said. "My 
feeling was, we should leave no stone unturned. We should go through everyone 
we thought conceivably might be a candidate. But quite honestly, our thoughts 
have been on Del for many months now. . . . We wanted to keep an open mind, 
(but) in the back of our mind, we always wanted Del Harris." 
</P>
<P>
 The choice, however, seems to present as many questions as it does answers. 
</P>
<P>
 With a young, struggling team that had trouble relating to a superstar such as 
Johnson, himself only three years removed from the league, what chance does 
Harris have? 
</P>
<P>
 With upper management that has long been devoted to the wide-open, running 
style of Showtime, why hire a coach who specializes in defense and the 
half-court game? 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was not fazed by either question at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 He was quick to point out that his teams can run with the best of them when 
the opportunity presents itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made my reputation as a college coach by having teams that scored 100 
points a game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The master of Showtime was Pat Riley, the last Laker coach of the glory years 
-- he was a rookie, too, when he took the job -- but Harris said it was the 
circumstances as much as the man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat Riley became categorized as a Showtime kind of coach," Harris said. "Now, 
he's doing just the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, indeed, has built the New York Knicks into a title contender with a 
tough, bruising, defense-minded style. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe a master coach must find a way to win with his particular talent," 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did Harris seem fazed by the problems Johnson encountered in trying to 
motivate a squad he saw lacking in the work ethic he and his teammates of the 
1980s lived by. 
</P>
<P>
 "Respect comes when you know what you're doing and the people that you're 
working with perceive that," Harris said. "I don't think it comes because you 
go out and try to seek it. If your goal is to go out and get respect, you 
probably won't find it." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris didn't see the age gap as a problem, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a young 56," he said. "I have a 4-year-old son (Dominic). I know some 
guys who are 50 and have cashed it in. They're dead. My father-in-law is 80 and 
he's one of the most active guys I know. He even has a girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to coach forever." 
</P>
<P>
 It sometimes seems as if he has. 
</P>
<P>
 After starting as head coach at Earlham College in Indiana in 1965, Harris 
became an NBA head coach with the Houston Rockets in 1979, after first serving 
as an assistant there under Tom Nissalke. Harris was 127-119 in his first three 
years in Houston, getting the Rockets into the playoffs in each of those 
seasons, and all the way to the finals in 1981, when his squad lost to the 
Boston Celtics. Harris left Houston after four years with a 141-187 record, 
including a 14-68 season after star center Moses Malone left for Philadelphia. 
He also coached the Bucks for a four-year span beginning in the 1987-88 season 
-- he was fired after an 8-9 start in 1991 -- and has an overall NBA record of 
332-341 and seven playoff appearances in eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He remained with the Bucks in the front office until 1992, then spent the last 
season writing a book, "Winning Defense," and serving as a consultant to the 
Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, however, had not given up his dream of returning to coaching and 
pursuing the goal that has always eluded him -- an NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 So, after Laker General Manager Jerry West, a good friend for more than two 
decades, called, they met last Tuesday and hammered out the basic points of a 
contract. The final touches were put on the deal Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 What impressed West the most, he said, was that Harris' first question wasn't, 
"How much does the job pay?" That, said West, made him stand out from other 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris has been knocked for being bland. Several columnists have referred to 
him as "Dull" Harris for years. 
</P>
<P>
 But those close to him insist that is not the case. Beneath that peaceful 
exterior, it is said, is a taskmaster who won't put up with the poor work ethic 
Johnson found. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris didn't seem dull at the news conference. When long-time announcer Chick 
Hearn asked what Harris felt the team required, the new coach answered with a 
smile, "I think we need a new broadcaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the early 1980s, when he was coaching Houston, Harris said, he decided 
at one point to get to know Malone a little better. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did you do during the summer?" Harris asked Malone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swimming pool," replied Malone, never one to waste words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, you built yourself a swimming pool?" Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Went swimming. Shot pool," Malone replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Communication between players and coaches was no better then than it is now. 
But Harris did fine with Malone, his favorite player. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers are counting on his doing as well now. Tough Acts to Follow 
</P>

<P>
 Oh, no. They hired Leslie Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Harris, who once wandered too far onto the court and got run down by a 
Denver Nugget. (True story.) Del Harris, who once went fishing and cast his 
pole right into the lake. (True story.) Del Harris, who upon being welcomed 
Friday to Los Angeles said what a genuine pleasure it was to be "here in New 
York." (True story.) 
</P>
<P>
 Del Harris, who once inspired a "Del Harris Look-alike Contest" that brought 
out every white-haired guy in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Harris, the Midwestern barber's son who, at least so far doesn't go in for 
that Forum wet-head look. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Harris, who once bumped into the real Leslie Nielsen at a basketball game 
in Chicago and spontaneously asked him to go inside Milwaukee's locker room and 
pretend to be the real Del Harris, which the actor promptly did, screaming at 
the Bucks to play harder and stop dribbling and act like men for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I can be his body double in the next 'Airplane!' or 'Naked Gun,' " 
Harris says. 
</P>
<P>
 Del does Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, I should take the hiring of Del Harris more seriously, and my 
apologies for calling you Shirley. After all, the Lakers finally chose somebody 
with NBA head-coaching experience. Magic Johnson had none. Randy Pfund had 
none. Mike Dunleavy had none. Pat Riley had none. Paul Westhead had none. Jack 
McKinney had none. Jerry West had none. When the Los Angeles Lakers put "no 
experience necessary" in a want ad, they ain't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Not this time, though. Harris has been around. Harris has coached 673 
honest-to-goodness, regular-season NBA games and 52 more in the playoffs. His 
1981 Houston team nearly succeeded the Lakers as NBA champion. He's a smart 
coach who could even communicate with Moses Malone. And he hardly ever gets run 
over by Nuggets anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I was just showin' the guys how to take a charge," Harris says. 
</P>
<P>
 Del has even been in demand. Four clubs, the new Laker coach volunteered, had 
contacted him during this last week. The Lakers actually had to beat other 
teams to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Harris, a guy with an NBA lifetime winning percentage of .493. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, at least the man has actually coached in the league. At least he doesn't 
have to learn on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Buss calls it "the best job in sports." His new coach calls it "what 
Jerry Buss properly called it, the top sports franchise in the country, in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 But this is the first time the Lakers have actually seen an applicant's 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 I had breakfast with Harris during the Final Four at Charlotte, back when ol' 
Doc Buss and the Lakers were mercifully about to end this very special season 
of Fun & Magic. At the time, I remember telling Harris that this Laker team was 
so bad, it didn't need Dr. Buss, it needed Dr. Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris in turn said, "The Lakers ever offer me a job, I'd come back from the 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Live, from the Inglewood Improv, let's have a big Laker hello for Mr. Del 
Harris, ladies and gentlemen. Some days, the guy is Leslie Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and is our new silver-domed coach ready for Showtime? Can he still cut the 
mustard at his age? 
</P>
<P>
 Let me put it this way: 
</P>
<P>
 He has a son who is 30 and another who is 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaching," Del Harris says, "is the most exciting thing you can do legally." 
</P>
<P>
 Nice having him here in New York.

PROBLEMS MOUNT FOR MCNALL; FINANCE: BANKS CLAIMING TO BE OWED NEARLY $162 
MILLION BY KING OWNER SEEK TO LIQUIDATE HIS ASSETS AND FORCE HIM INTO PERSONAL 
BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three banks claiming to be owed nearly $162 million by King owner Bruce McNall 
moved late Friday to force the sports mogul into personal bankruptcy 
proceedings, an action that threatens to scuttle his deal to sell a majority of 
his hockey team, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The three banks are the French bank Credit Lyonnais, Dutch-owned European 
American Bank and IBJ Schroder, a unit of the Industrial Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The three are seeking to have McNall's assets liquidated under Chapter 7 of 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Credit Lyonnais is by far the largest creditor, 
listing $121 million in loans to a movie producing operation, horse racing 
businesses and a coin firm. European American listed $31.4 million in a loan to 
McNall, and IBJ listed $9.2 million owed for loans on McNall's horse racing 
interests. The loans are largely unsecured. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement on behalf of the three creditors, a Credit Lyonnais spokesman 
said: "We have had protracted negotiations with McNall that have not produced a 
satisfactory resolution for all creditors. The purpose of this action is to 
make sure that all assets of McNall's are available to his creditors on an 
equitable basis." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall can legally contest the filing for involuntary bankruptcy, and a 
bankruptcy judge must accept the petition. But experts said that acceptance is 
likely to be only a formality. Should the Kings and other McNall operations be 
placed under bankruptcy proceedings, it would mark the first time such a thing 
has happened to a major Los Angeles sports franchise. It also would be the 
first time since the 1970s that an NHL team would be involved in bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, an attorney for McNall called the filing "precipitous and 
uncalled for." The lawyer added that McNall "has been exerting herculean 
efforts to maximize the value of his assets for his creditors' benefit" and 
that he "intends to continue his efforts to maximize repayment to his 
creditors, which has always been his primary objective."  
</P>
<P>
 The filing clearly throws into doubt the sale of the Kings, which all of the 
parties involved were aiming to close as early as Monday. As previously 
reported, McNall is trying to sell a 72% interest in the team for $60 million 
to telecommunications executive Jeffrey P. Sudikoff and entertainment executive 
Joseph M. Cohen as part of a plan to rid McNall of a $92-million loan owed Bank 
of America. McNall's remaining 28% would be put into a trust, with a percentage 
of cash generated by the Kings used to pay off some other creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that Bank of America -- which is financing the transaction 
temporarily -- could still use its leverage as a secured creditor to push for 
the sale regardless of the petition, although Credit Lyonnais and the other 
banks could seek a court order to stop it.  
</P>
<P>
 A Bank of America spokesman declined comment. Prospective buyer Sudikoff also 
declined to comment on the impact of the filing.  
</P>
<P>
 There are several immediate concerns should the sale remain in limbo for any 
length of time. Sudikoff and Cohen already spent more than $4 million covering 
the Kings' payroll during the season. The next payroll is due on Monday but 
appears to be covered through monies due the team from the Forum's Senate Seat 
program, sources told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last pay period -- in which the club was late in issuing paychecks 
by two days -- Cohen said he approached Laker and Forum owner Jerry Buss and 
received the Senate Seat money to cover payroll. "He didn't have to do it, he 
was a gentleman about it," Cohen said of Buss. "If he hadn't done it, we would 
have met payroll ourselves." Front-office staff, coaches and players that are 
paid all year, rather than seasonally, were affected. One prominent player 
confirmed that he was paid late but requested anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Wayne Gretzky's new contract calls for seven-figure payments at 
the end of June and the end of August. Gretzky had offered to defer his 
payments, so that he could be paid out of playoff revenue, thereby lessening 
the cash-flow problems during the season. But the Kings did not make the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another pressing matter is the refund of money due fans for playoff tickets. 
Approximately $4 million was collected from fans who wanted playoff tickets. 
Season ticket-holders traditionally have the option of a refund or rolling the 
money over toward the purchase of 1994-95 season tickets.  
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' season ended April 14. There is no NHL policy regarding the 
handling of playoff refunds or deadlines for that to be done, and different 
teams have different policies. For instance, the Mighty Ducks and the Tampa Bay 
Lightning did not send out invoices for playoff money during the season.  
</P>
<P>
 In late January, the Kings sent out a letter requesting a 75% payment on or 
before Feb. 25. The delay in refunds has been a point of contention for fans, 
who have been told they will receive their money once the sale of the Kings 
closes. Now, that close could be a long time coming. 
</P>
<P>
 As previously reported, McNall's financial condition -- hurt by such factors 
as a large debt and a soft rare coin market -- has been deteriorating rapidly. 
In addition, a McNall lawyer has confirmed that McNall is under investigation 
by a federal grand jury for allegedly falsifying loan documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with McNall's finances told The Times Friday that his overall 
debt is as much as $330 million. McNall has disputed his liability on some of 
that amount, in particular $96 million owed to Credit Lyonnais by Gladden 
Entertainment, a movie production company he jointly owned with longtime 
Hollywood executive David Begelman. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall says he owns only 10% of Gladden. A source close to Credit Lyonnais, 
however, said the bank maintains that McNall entered into an earlier agreement 
that would make him responsible for the debt.  
</P>
<P>
 The filing comes amid tense negotiations between creditors and McNall. Sources 
close to the negotiations cited two reasons for the filing Friday: growing 
frustration in getting details from McNall's advisers and a feeling that 
favoritism was being shown some smaller creditors. McNall, for example, reached 
an agreement in February to settle a lawsuit filed by his partners in Beverly 
Hills-based Superior Stamp and Coin who had accused him of misusing company 
funds.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was urgent. It was partly because of the sale, but it was just time. There 
was a need to get control of the process," one creditor said.  
</P>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman had little to say about the development Friday 
night. Said Bettman: "My understanding is that this is a personal financial 
condition relating to Bruce. This isn't about the Kings. I'm not overly 
concerned about it affecting the Kings. I hope he (McNall) can sort it out." 
The McNall Saga: 
</P>
<P>
 * Latest Action: Three banks move to force McNall into personal bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Why: To try to recover some of the nearly $162 million they claim McNall 
owes them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Impact: The action could threaten McNall's effort to sell a majority 
interest in the Kings.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Litke of the Associated Press doubts that soccer will catch on as a 
popular sport in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five weeks before the World Cup arrives on these shores, there is little to 
suggest that the same game Americans ranked behind log rolling in a survey last 
year has a better foothold now than it did then," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott LeTellier, chief operating officer for World Cup USA 1994, has a 
different opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer is definitely being talked about in circles where it was not being 
talked about before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Litke, "We think otherwise, unfortunately, judging by the circles we run 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What is the NBA playoff record for most points scored in the 
fourth quarter?

they didn't have a good spread (of food) in the clubhouse, I wouldn't survive."

 Don't feel too sorry for him. The major league minimum salary is $109,000 per 
year.

 Do you understand?Detroit Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson empathizes with Tony 
La Russa, manager of the floundering Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what the guy in the other dugout is feeling because I've been there 
myself," Anderson told Tom Gage of the Detroit News. "My God, what an awful 
feeling it is. I understand that. But understanding is something you'll never 
truly understand."

 Forget it: Art Spander of the San Francisco Examiner on Charles Barkley 
scoring 56 points against Golden State in an NBA first-round playoff game:

 Call of the wild: Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post on the upsurge in NBA 
trash talk: "You don't hear woofin' like this at the Iditarod."

 "Be magnanimous. In interviews -- and even in timeout huddles -- refer to your 
teammates as 'my supporting cast,' just in case some of them don't realize how 
insignificant they really are." 
</P>
<P>
 Sort of spooky: Raymond Floyd describing the "zone" he gets into on a golf 
course: "I feel like I'm going half speed. I'm not hitting the ground very hard 
when I walk. I'm aware there are people around but I don't see them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might talk to the player I'm walking with, but I don't know it. I'm alone 
and at ease."

 Depressing division: Bob Kravitz of the Rocky Mountain News: "If the Dallas 
Mavericks played in the American League West, they'd be in second place."

COACHING PEERS PRAISE HARRIS' HIRING; PRO BASKETBALL: MANY, INCLUDING DALY AND 
NELSON, THINK HE HAS QUALITIES REQUIRED TO RESTORE LAKER PRIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coaches he once worked for love him. Coaches he has preceded in NBA jobs rave 
about him. Coaches who know him only as an opponent marvel at his knowledge of 
the game and welcome his return to their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers' announcement Friday that they have hired Del Harris to be their 
coach set off a cascade of compliments from his peers. Grim though the Lakers' 
prospects seem after a 33-49 record that kept them out of the playoffs for the 
first time in 18 seasons, the consensus among NBA coaches was that if anyone 
can guide the Lakers back toward their former glory, Harris can. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely pleased for Del Harris," New Jersey Coach Chuck Daly said. "He 
is one of the outstanding coaches I have played against, and I am very 
confident he will help restore the pride in the Laker organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State Coach Don Nelson, who was the Milwaukee Bucks' coach and director 
of player personnel in 1983 when he hired Harris as a scout, agreed Harris has 
the record, reputation and motivational skills to turn the Lakers around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Lakers made an excellent choice in hiring Del Harris. He's worked 
with me as my assistant and competed against me as a head coach and I think 
he's one of the finest guys in basketball," said Nelson, who made Harris his 
top assistant in Milwaukee in June of 1986. Harris succeeded Nelson as the 
Bucks' coach a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I commend the Lakers on their selection. I think he's going to do a great 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, whose relationship with Harris goes back more than 20 years, said one 
of Harris' strengths is his ability to communicate with players. That's no easy 
task, as Magic Johnson discovered during his 16-game term as coach after Randy 
Pfund was fired.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson cited players' lack of diligence in practice and in games as his 
biggest frustration. Nelson said he expects Harris, known as a disciplinarian, 
to be firm enough to cope with players who become complacent once they have the 
security of a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll do as good a job as anybody is capable of doing," Nelson said. "He's an 
excellent teacher, very perceptive and very patient and a good judge of 
character. There isn't a situation that will come up that Del won't be able to 
handle." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Dunleavy, who gave up the Laker coaching job in May of 1992 to succeed 
Harris as the Bucks' coach and vice president of basketball operations, is 
another member of Harris' fan club. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunleavy also predicted Harris will instill a solid work ethic among his 
high-paid players and will create a much-needed atmosphere of calm on a team 
that has gone through two coaches in less than a season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think first of all Del will give the situation some stability," Dunleavy 
said. "Also, he's one of the hardest-working coaches I've been around and one 
of the smartest as far as X's and O's. He understands the game as well as 
anybody, and I think he's going to do a great job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game has changed in that regard (encouraging young players with lucrative 
contracts to work harder). The way the money structure has changed within the 
last couple of years has changed things a great deal, as far as players coming 
into this league making the kind of money they do and knowing their future is 
secure, instead of establishing themselves like the players of old. You carried 
bags, and you carried the 24-second clock. Now it's 'If I don't like it, I'm 
going to take my ball and go home.' "I think everybody is trying to figure that 
out. Instead of fining, coaches are going to have to go to suspending. I think 
Del is a really bright person. He's going to know how to handle whatever 
situations might come up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers face many key personnel decisions, such as whether to buy out James 
Worthy's contract, where -- and if -- Doug Christie will play and whether they 
can afford to sign the "go-to" player they have lacked in recent years. The 
strong friendship between Harris and Laker General Manager Jerry West is likely 
to carry over to their working relationship, Dunleavy said, making such 
decisions easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at that team and I think there's a certain level of competence," 
Dunleavy said. "There are some good players. The pieces are there. In some 
cases, they've got to figure out what roles this guy will play. I think Jerry 
as general manager and Del as coach are going to have to get together and 
figure out who fits and where those players fit. They have two great minds, two 
guys who are very good at what they do."

 Reliever Jim Gott's earned-run average going into tonight's game is 5.71, he 
has walked 11 batters in 17 innings, and he has already given up three home 
runs. So Gott can only shrug and smile when he is asked what it's like to pitch 
so raggedly and still wind up with a 4-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just the way game is," he said. "There's been plenty of times in my 
career when I've thought I've pitched pretty good for a stretch and instead of 
4-1, I'm 1-4. Things kind of even out, you've got to keep that steady flow 
through everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when he was thrust into the closer role after Todd Worrell was 
injured, Gott saved 25 games, walked only 17 in 77 2/3 innings and had a 
career-low 2.32 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 This year? With the emergence of rookie Darren Dreifort, he has had several 
appearances as a set-up man and several games in which he has entered with 
leads and given up tying runs only to have the Dodgers rally for victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "They began the season calling me Pedro Martinez (last year's mostly 
successful set-up man), and it's gone to 'the Vulture.' Because it's obvious, 
guys like Orel Hershiser, he should be 6-1, 6-0, they way he's been pitching -- 
but I'm going in there, giving up runs, then getting the win. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, I've been trying too hard to get out there and kind of 
re-establish what I did last year. You just can't look back to the past and 
expect to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying to throw my pitches early, and the hitters have been smart 
-- they're not swinging and I'm getting behind in the count."

 In the first inning Friday night, second baseman Delino DeShields was caught 
trying to steal for the first time this season. DeShields, who had been 
successful on his first 12 attempts -- tying a career high for consecutive 
steals -- was thrown out at second by Padre catcher Brad Ausmus. TIM KAWAKAMI

 There will be no celebration of the event, and quite frankly, the five-year 
anniversary won't be recognized in three weeks in the Kingdome. But you ask 
Angel second baseman Harold Reynolds about that June 5, 1989 evening, and it's 
a feat that, he says, that will never be forgotten as long as he lives. "You 
know, I look back on it now," Reynolds said, "and it's still hard for me to 
believe it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 It will forever be remembered in Bo Jackson folklore as "the Throw." Reynolds, 
playing in a 3-3 tie in the 10th inning, took off for second base on a 
hit-and-run when Scott Bradley lined a ball into the left field corner. 
Reynolds was already around third by the time Jackson, playing for Kansas City, 
caught the ball off of the wall at the warning track, 310 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing flat-footed, with one foot on the track and the other on the turf, 
Jackson turned and threw the ball home without taking a stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw the ball go into the corner," Reynolds said, "I said, 'The game's 
over. It's all over.' But I was still coming on hard, anyway. I'm about to 
slide, and I see the ball in (catcher) Bob Boone's mitt. "I just said, 'You've 
got to be kidding me.' He threw the ball on the fly. People can tell all the 
stories they want about Bo," Reynolds said, "but believe me, nothing will ever 
top that one."

 Angel broadcaster Ken Brett was given a wooden cutout of former manager Casey 
Stengel that he plans to display prominently in his home. "Did you ever play 
for him?" Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett: "No, but I named my kid after him."

<P>
 It's believed Johnny Ray in 1987 was the last Angel to have back-to-back 
four-hit games, and now Tim Salmon has had two successive four-hit games 
followed by Friday's five-for-five performance.

 Felix Fermin remains the Mariners' starting shortstop, he can't help but look 
over his shoulder at the blur coming his way. Alex Rodriguez, the first pick in 
the 1993 draft, is batting .344 with 11 homers and 33 runs batted in in the 
first 32 games at Class-A Appleton. He's expected to be promoted to double-A 
next week, and join the Mariners after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, he'll be here," Mariner Manager Lou Piniella said, "and he'll be 
here a long, long time." BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Reynolds, who played four years in Seattle, also tells his favorite story 
about Ken Griffey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey didn't make an out in an organized baseball game until he was 15 years 
old, the way Reynolds tells it, and when he finally did, he spots his mom in 
the stands and tells her that he might quit baseball for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what you're so upset about," Albert Griffey said. "Your dad 
makes outs all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Griffey: "I'm not my dad. I don't make outs." 
</P>
<P>
 "True story," Reynolds said.

JEFFIRES CHANGES HIS MIND ABOUT THE RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: WIDE RECEIVER DOES AN 
ABOUT-FACE AND AGREES TO TERMS FOR RETURNING TO THE OILERS. 
</P>

 A day after the Rams announced that Haywood Jeffires had agreed to terms on a 
one-year deal, the three-time Pro Bowl receiver said Friday that he would 
re-sign with the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires agreed to terms with the Oilers Friday on a one-year, $1.25-million 
contract with an option year valued at $1.9 million.He expects to sign by 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was one of the scariest moments anyone could dream of," Jeffires said. 
"It's like fighting a war. But I feel good about what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Believing they had a deal done Thursday, the Rams sent assistant coaches Joe 
Vitt and Steve Moore to Jeffires' home in Greensboro, N.C., to meet with the 
player and his agent, Fred Joseph. After a series of meetings Friday, Jeffires 
chose Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believed they had accepted our contract proposal," said Jay Zygmunt, Ram 
senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires rejected the Rams' original three-year, $3.9-million offer on April 
15 because he wanted more money, and the Rams tried unsuccessfully to trade for 
Dallas' Alvin Harper on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never wanted to leave the Oilers," Jeffires said. "Because there has always 
been a special place in my heart for Houston. Now I can concentrate on 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Ram receivers are Flipper Anderson, newly signed free agents Greg 
McMurtry and Nate Lewis, Ernie Jones, Sean LaChapelle and injured Todd Kinchen. 
 
</P>
<P>
 They also selected two receivers in the April draft -- Isaac Bruce of Memphis 
State and Chris Brantley of Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams announced the signing of defensive end Robert Young to a three-year 
deal worth $3.6 million.

HIS OWN MAN; JARET WRIGHT IS PROUD TO BE CLYDE'S SON BUT READY TO ESTABLISH A 
SEPARATE IDENTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jaret Wright wiped the sweat from his brow, stood upright and inhaled the 
deepest breath of his young life as the firing squad took aim last August in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting was the annual Area Code Games, an event designed to help 
professional scouts and college recruiters in their search for young baseball 
talent. Wright was an especially hot item during the four-day window-shopping 
extravaganza in which the top players in the class of 1994 showcased their 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Talent evaluators raised their radar guns in unison each time the Katella High 
pitcher prepared to throw. And like any good salesman, Wright continually made 
the right pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 He dazzled the crowd at San Diego State's Smith Field and forced the baseball 
experts -- men not easily wowed -- to do double takes at their speed guns' 
numbers.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Wright unleashed a crackling fastball that traveled consistently at 
94 m.p.h. So impressive was Wright that many of the guys with the guns believe 
he might head the class of high school pitchers selected in the June amateur 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the way he planned it. Ah, well, sort of anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so nervous," Wright said. "I've never been in a situation like that 
before -- tons of scouts, tons of coaches and your destiny in your own hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "There must have been 30 or 40 scouts behind the plate watching me. It was 
like a must-win situation, and walking away knowing you did your job is a great 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 The son of former Angel pitcher Clyde Wright, Jaret possesses tools that might 
help him become a pitching force in his own right. He hopes his blazing 
fastball will help him light a path out from behind his father's long shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Wright traveled as swiftly as one of his pitches.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jaret is one of the best pitchers in high school this year," said Joe 
Ingalls, an area scout for the Chicago White Sox. "He throws real hard, and not 
many kids throw hard these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Esperanza Coach Mike Curran believes Wright has as much raw talent as 
any high school pitcher he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember anybody who threw as hard as he does with the curveball that 
he's got," Curran said. "And none of the other guys were the athlete he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Based in large part on his smashing audition in San Diego, and because of the 
praise of those who witnessed the performance, Baseball America ranks Wright as 
the fourth-best high school prospect in the nation. Agents, recruiters and 
scouts have the Wrights' home phone number on speed-dial lists. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that everyone wants a piece of the action. Even Sports Illustrated 
came calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaret was pictured in the magazine's "Faces in the Crowd" section May 2. He 
was all smiles of course, just the expression one would expect from someone who 
at 18 seemingly has the world hanging on every flick of his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that Sports Illustrated came out, it was really kind of amazing," Wright 
said. "I mean, this is a national magazine that you're in as high school 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been looking at that thing for so long, so it's strange actually 
thinking you're now in one." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the path to celebrity, Wright has been the focus of good-natured barbs 
from coaches and teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Sports Illustrated thing came out, Coach (Tim McMenamin) said, 'He's 
big-time now,' " Wright said. "My buddies say stuff like, 'Can I have your 
autograph?' 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's all been playful. Everybody has a good time with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Such scrutiny and time demands can be taxing for most families. For the 
Wrights, however, it's commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not unusual around here," said Vicki Wright, mother of five children. 
"It's really nice that this is happening with Jaret because I'm so used to 
dealing with this with Clyde." 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde is one of the Angels' all-time pitching leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 He signed with the Angels in 1965 and reached the big leagues a season later. 
Clyde pitched for the Angels until 1973, and is fifth on the club in career 
victories (87). 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde had his best season in 1970, finishing 22-12 with a 2.83 earned-run 
average. He is one of only five Angel 20-game winners, joining Nolan Ryan, who 
accomplished the feat twice, Dean Chance, Andy Messersmith and Bill Singer. 
</P>
<P>
 He pitched for Milwaukee in 1974, Texas the next season and in Japan for three 
seasons (1976-78) before retiring with a major league record of 100-111 and a 
3.50 ERA. Clyde works for the Angels in community relations and runs a pitching 
school in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde and Jaret are a father-and-son no-hitter tandem -- albeit their feat is 
separated by more than two decades and several levels of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 As an Angel in 1970, Clyde no-hit Oakland in a 4-0 victory. Jaret no-hit 
Laguna Hills in a 7-1 victory March 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching his son's development brings to mind fond memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he realizes exactly where he's sitting," Clyde said. "He's got 
good mechanics and he throws pretty darn hard. That's something a lot of people 
are looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny thing is, though, Jaret wasn't sure he had it in him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaret said the velocity on his pitches had not been measured until the Area 
Code Games. Of course, he figured he threw hard -- just not that hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea," he said. "I never thought about that stuff. I don't stand (on 
the pitching mound) and think, 'What did this scout say, or what was (the 
reading on) the gun.' 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as you say, 'I'm going to try and throw this hard, or do this to 
impress this guy,' is when you have problems. If you keep focused on the game, 
all that other stuff will come." 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde said Jaret's arm strength did not come from his father's genes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He must have got that from his mother's side," Clyde said, jokingly. "Heck, I 
never got it up there at more than maybe 85, 87 (m.p.h.)." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaret credits his father, God and football for his velocity. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde did not break out the radar gun during his tutoring of Jaret, instead 
opting to focus on the technical points of his son's delivery. Also, Jaret 
participated diligently in an intense weight-training regimen during his four 
seasons in Katella's football program. Jaret was the starting quarterback on 
the varsity the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 2 and 220 pounds, Jaret said he can bench press 250 pounds. The work 
in football paid off in increased arm strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also have to thank God for giving me the gift of a strong arm," Jaret said. 
"If it was just something you could teach, then everybody would have one." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaret credits his father for not turning baseball into something unhealthy. He 
said Clyde was the antithesis of those "Little League fathers" who push their 
kids so much they come to hate the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is enough pressure from school and playing baseball, so not having to 
come home and worry about what my dad would think really helped," Wright said. 
"When I was doing something bad, I knew I could ask for help. Instead of 
yelling at me from the stands, my dad was always there for me." 
</P>
<P>
 However, for all the help Clyde provides, he is also a source of frustration 
for Jaret. Being the son of a former major leaguer does not come without its 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having your dad looked at as a public figure in baseball and then you come up 
having some baseball talent makes people expect things," Wright said. "I've had 
stories about me in the paper during football season that said, 'Jaret Wright, 
the son of . . .' I mean, my dad never even played football. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I've just had to learn to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde has counseled Jaret on how to change the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I'm going to be his father until I die, and he's going to be my 
son until he dies," Clyde said. "So what he has to do is get good enough so 
people start saying, 'Look, there goes Jaret Wright's father.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The process is in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 A co-captain for the Knights, Wright finished the regular season 7-2 with a 
2.98 ERA. He pitched Katella to a share of the Empire League championship -- 
its first baseball title since 1981 -- by shutting out Cypress, 5-0, in the 
regular-season finale Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, he struck out 13 batters to reach 100 (in 75 innings) and lead 
the county in that category. Wright is skilled at the plate, too. Third in the 
Knights' lineup, Wright batted .430 with seven home runs and 32 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Wright's first on the varsity, he was 4-3 with a 3.01 ERA and 80 
strikeouts. He hit .451 with seven home runs and 26 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 While his pitching numbers are less than prodigious, people who make baseball 
decisions are unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't matter," said Chuck Menzhuber, an area scout for the St. Louis 
Cardinals. "When you're looking at guys, you have to project how they will be 
three or four years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to picture them at 20 or 21 and try to figure how good they'll be 
then. He's far along in terms of how hard you need to throw." 
</P>
<P>
 College recruiters are of the same mind-set. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright has scholarship offers to play baseball at BYU and UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 But if he is a high draft choice, he can expect an immediate financial 
windfall. Just like dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I signed for $10,000 in 1965, and I was on top of the mountain," Clyde said. 
"I thought I had all the money in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Signing bonus money, of course, is a little better today. 
</P>
<P>
 First-round draft choices last season signed for between $355,000 and $1.3 
million. The first high school pitcher selected in the 1993 draft, Kirk 
Presley, was taken by the Mets with the eighth overall pick and signed for 
$900,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The money that players are offered depends on numerous variables, such as how 
high they are selected, by whom and if they have the added bargaining leverage 
of college scholarship offers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wrights have not discussed how much money it would take for Jaret to head 
for the minor leagues. No matter the course he takes, his mom believes one 
thing has changed for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've spent a big part of my life being Clyde Wright's wife," Vicki said. "And 
now it looks like I'm getting ready to be Jaret Wright's mom."

OPPONENTS SEE DOUBLE WITH SADDLEBACK'S LETE TWINS ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't be embarrassed if you can't tell the Lete brothers apart. Hardly anybody 
can. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Knapp, Saddleback High School's track and field coach, thought he was 
speaking with Matt after the Sea View League championships last week, but later 
discovered he had been talking with his twin brother Mel. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think that after four years of having them around, I would be able 
to tell the difference between the two," said Knapp, who has headed the 
Roadrunners' program for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As Knapp is quick to point out, it doesn't much matter which Lete is in a 
race. Either is capable of showing up the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel is faster, but Matt has more endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unusual, but Matt's a little stronger, and Mel seems to have more 
energy, which makes him the fastest," Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Never have the Lete brothers played a more formidable role for Saddleback than 
in the league finals May 6, when they helped account for 54 of Saddleback's 87 
points. The Roadrunners nearly dethroned two-time defending champion 
Woodbridge, which won by a point. 
</P>
<P>
 To open the evening, Mel ran the second leg on the 400-meter relay, then 
watched his brother anchor the team to a season's-best time and third-place 
finish, qualifying it for today's Southern Section Division II preliminaries. 
Matt then won the 400 meters in a personal-best 49.09 seconds, and Mel followed 
by finishing third in the 100 in 11.29. They finished first and second in the 
300 intermediate hurdles, then helped the 1,600-relay team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without them, we're nothing," Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't as if Knapp hadn't seen it before. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two weeks earlier, the brothers obliterated the field in the 300 
intermediate hurdles at the Orange County Championships. Mel led the way, 
winning in a then county-leading time of 38.52, with Matt close behind at 
39.16. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't matter who won or who got second, but (a sweep) was the plan," said 
Mel, who qualified for last spring's State meet in the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Matt: "That had never happened to us before in that big of a meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it appears hurdling is the Letes' niche, they are two of the busiest 
athletes at Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 They got a lot of playing time on offense and defense for the Roadrunners' 
football team, despite weighing only 140 pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the fact that they stand only 5 feet 7, Mel was a starting guard 
on the basketball team and Matt was a key reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Their favorite sports? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we both like track first, and basketball is second," said Matt, 
adding that he and his brother can easily dunk a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we weren't going to get a look from college coaches in football," 
said Mel, explaining their dedication to track. 
</P>
<P>
 Knapp says the twins' constant smiles make them unique. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's a real high because I enjoy working with kids who are having a 
good time," Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today it's the section preliminaries and next week the finals. After that, the 
Masters meet and then State. The latter is the ultimate goal for the Letes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to get them both there," said Knapp, who has had an athlete 
in the State finals each of the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mel: "I am going to have to get my time down into the 37s if I want to 
get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Matt: "Every time I run the quarter, I get faster. So we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 Some might think the competition would create a rift between the brothers. Not 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are so close," Knapp said. "They are really two loving brothers. They 
are the kind of boys, that if you were a dad, you'd want them as your sons."

SAFETY MEASURES TAKEN BY FORMULA ONE BODY; AUTO RACING: SWIFT ACTION DESIGNED 
PRIMARILY TO REDUCE SPEEDS IN WAKE OF TRAGEDIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 With two racers dead and a third in a coma, the organization that runs Formula 
One auto racing took drastic measures Friday to make the sport safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Overriding its agreement with Formula One teams, the International Automobile 
Federation (FIA) unilaterally imposed measures designed primarily to reduce 
speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that needs to be done -- anything that we think usefully can be done 
-- will be done," FIA President Max Mosley said. "We don't have any choice." 
</P>
<P>
 FIA has been pressured to act since the deaths of three-time world champion 
Ayrton Senna of Brazil and Roland Ratzenberger of Austria in high-speed crashes 
during the San Marino Grand Prix two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Thursday, the first day of racing since Senna's death, Karl Wendlinger 
of Austria crashed during a warm-up before the opening qualifying session of 
the Monaco Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of FIA's new regulations are to take effect immediately after Sunday's 
race. The new regulations will reduce cars' downforce, increase minimum weight 
limits and improve protection for the driver in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 The action is an apparent violation of the Concorde Agreement, which 
stipulates that the teams and the governing body must agree on any major 
changes to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time has come, because of the gravity of the situation and the force of 
public opinion, to push aside such considerations and do what is right in the 
general interest of the sport," Mosley said. "What we want to put forward does 
not meet with everyone's approval." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at Saint Roch Hospital in Nice, France, said Wendlinger was being kept 
in an artificial coma on a respirator to lighten the load on a brain bruise. 
His team said Friday it would not race Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Australia, 1980 Formula One champion Alan Jones said the Monte 
Carlo course is unsafe because it does not have enough escape areas for cars in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the modern Formula One cars have outgrown the circuit," Jones 
said. "It's dangerous in a lot of places, but at the same time it's difficult 
to shift seven-story buildings to create more run-off (areas). 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it's Monaco, the drivers continue to race there."

TRACY'S CRASH NO BOOST FOR PENSKE TEAM; INDIANAPOLIS 500: THE PLAN IS TO PUT 
THREE DRIVERS IN THE FRONT ROW, BUT DOCTORS HAVE LAST SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most pressing question in years at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway will be 
answered today, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 The question: Have Roger Penske's three drivers -- Emerson Fittipaldi, Paul 
Tracy and Al Unser Jr. -- been sandbagging during practice for the Indy 500 by 
not showing all the horsepower available from the new Mercedes-Benz push-rod 
engine? 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everyone within the sound of the 220-m.p.h. Indy cars going around the 
Speedway's 2 1/2-mile rectangular oval insists that they are. Expectations were 
for the Penske trio to line up in the front row for the race May 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy dimmed that prospect Friday, at least slightly, when his Penske-Mercedes 
slid out of control through the infield coming off the third turn, hit the 
outside wall twice and then spun back across the track before coming to a stop 
against the inside guard rail in the fourth turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian driver suffered a concussion and a bruised left foot. He was 
taken to Methodist Hospital for X-rays and overnight observation. Doctors will 
decide this morning if he can try to qualify his backup car when time trials 
begin at 11 a.m. (CDT). 
</P>
<P>
 The Penske forces, who have been wearing happy faces because of the 
performance of the controversial engine, nevertheless insist that today's 
four-lap time trials will be more than a one-team show. They claim that 
conventional Ford and Ilmor overhead cam engines will be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigel Mansell, who came from England last year as the Formula One champion and 
added the American Indy car championship to his trophy room, has been the most 
vocal of the crowd charging the Penske team with holding back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Penskes are using only about 50 inches of boost and saving five inches of 
boost for Saturday," he said after watching Fittipaldi and Tracy run better 
than 230 m.p.h. in practice. "I'm not a betting man, but if I were, I would 
know who to bet on for the pole." 
</P>
<P>
 Said car owner Dick Simon, who has six car-driver combinations ready for 
qualifying: "It looked to me like they were lifting (getting off the throttle) 
going down the back straightaway, like they were holding something back." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States Auto Club, which sanctions the 500, permits push-rod, or 
stock block, engines 55 inches of manifold pressure, called boost. Penske's 
Mercedes and some reworked Buicks get the 55 inches. The overhead cam engines, 
built specifically for racing and used by most of the other drivers, are 
allowed only 45 inches of boost. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule has been in the USAC book for three years, but until Penske and Ilmor 
engineers Mario Illien and Paul Morgan -- with financial backing from 
Mercedes-Benz -- set out to build their own, no one noticed. Buicks had gone 
fast in the past, but were seldom a factor on race day.  
</P>
<P>
 When the project was announced last month, there were rumors that Unser had 
tested at 238 m.p.h. -- a rumor Penske adamantly denies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be qualifying for the second or third row," said Mansell, who 
drives a Ford-powered Lola. "It's just ludicrous to think the Mercedes won't be 
in the front row with 10 more inches of boost than the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi, whose lap of 230.438 m.p.h. has been the fastest in practice, said 
the Penskes were still having teething problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't seem to realize it, but there is no advantage to sandbagging, so 
why should we do it?" the defending Indy 500 winner asked. "We are still 
working out the marriage of the engine and the chassis. I don't know how much 
horsepower the engineers are getting, but for sure, more horsepower doesn't do 
you any good if you can't get it around the corners." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy can attest to that. He had been lapping at better than 228 when the 
right rear end got loose and he didn't make the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Whichever way the question is answered today, pole qualifying will be like a 
race within itself. The winner will receive $100,000 from PPG and a Ford custom 
van valued at $30,000 -- richer prizes than the winners receive at some Indy 
car races.

INDIANAPOLIS 500 / DAILY REPORT; DRIVERS PREDICT IT WILL TAKE SPEED OF 226 TO 
234 M.P.H. TO WIN POLE 
</P>

<P>
 Between practice laps while preparing for today's Indy 500 qualifying, drivers 
predicted that a speed of 226 to 234 m.p.h. will be needed to win the pole. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Mauricio Gugelmin, a former Formula One driver from Brazil, picked the 
highest average speed, 234.598 for four laps. Another rookie, Mark Smith, 
predicted the lowest, 226.340. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson Fittipaldi, last year's race winner, was right in the middle with a 
prediction of 230.500. That is almost exactly what he ran as the fastest 
practice lap so far, 230.438. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight drivers predicted that Roberto Guerrero's 1992 record of 232.482 would 
be broken. Guerrero also holds the one-lap record of 232.618. The veteran 
driver from San Juan Capistrano will try to qualify today in the same '92 
Lola-Buick V-6 he drove to the record. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Smith woke up Friday, he realized it was Friday the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not superstitious, but I knew I wouldn't get through the day without 
something happening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the day, he brushed the wall in the third turn and damaged the car. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Simon, not content with trying to get six cars into the Indy 500, is 
planning to field a Ford Thunderbird in the Brickyard 400, the Aug. 6 NASCAR 
stock car race that will be the first non-Indy car race ever held at the 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver is expected to be either P.J. Jones or Joe Ruttman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Andretti, in his final year of Indy car racing, was asked what he felt 
was the most significant change at Indianapolis since he began racing at the 
track in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allowing women in the pits," he answered. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, the first woman in either the pits or garages was admitted in 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parnelli Jones, the 1963 winner, will drive this year's pace car, a Ford 
Mustang Cobra. He is the 11th former winner to do the honors. Others were Bobby 
Unser, Jim Rathmann, Johnnie Parsons, Rodger Ward, Mauri Rose, Sam Hanks, 
Wilbur Shaw, Tommy Milton, Ralph DePalma and Joe Dawson. SHAV GLICK

<P>
 Holy Bull, the beaten favorite in the Kentucky Derby, won't run in the 
Preakness because of minor physical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The gray colt's blood count was off and he was being treated with antibiotics, 
owner-trainer Jimmy Croll said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a couple of things wrong," Croll said from his base at Monmouth 
Park. "Nothing drastic, but the vet said it would be better to give him seven 
or eight extra days (of rest.)." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull finished 12th in the Derby after being bumped badly at the start and 
slammed again in the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Croll said Holy Bull will be pointed to the one-mile Metropolitan Handicap at 
Belmont Park May 30, 12 days before the 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes, the final 
race of the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Derby starters who appear set for the 1 3/16-mile Preakness next Saturday at 
Pimlico are Derby winner Go For Gin; Blumin Affair, third; Tabasco Cat, sixth; 
Powis Castle, ninth, and Ulises, last in the 14-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 Other probables are Kandaly, the Louisiana Derby winner scratched from the 
Kentucky Derby because of the sloppy track; Numerous, winner of the Derby 
Trial; Concern, the Arkansas Derby winner; Polar Expedition, winner of the Jim 
Beam but last in the Illinois Derby, and Silver Goblin, third in the Arkansas 
Derby.

PREP NOTES; DICK HILL TO GET ANOTHER CHANCE TO ADD TO RECORD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dick Hill, Orange County's winningest high school football coach, was named 
head coach at Orange High, Panther Athletic Director Dave Zirkle said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 65, replaces Buddy Bland, who resigned this week to take a coaching and 
teaching job in Federal Way, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always exciting to take over a new job," Hill said. "It's like being a 
little kid again. At my age, that's a pretty exciting thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 196-87-3 as a coach, had applied for coaching positions at Ocean View, 
Buena Park and Brethren Christian last year, but spent last season as a junior 
varsity coach at Savanna. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes over an Orange program that finished 2-8 and 0-5 in the Century 
League last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very ecstatic to replace somebody as good as Buddy Bland with somebody 
of Dick Hill's caliber," Zirkle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill set the county record for victories in 1991, surpassing the mark of 191 
set by Loara's Herb Hill. Dick Hill was fired in 1992 after eight seasons as 
Santa Ana's coach because he was retiring as a teacher and the school wanted a 
full-time teacher as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the 1992 season as an assistant to Tom Meiss at Foothill. MIKE

<P>
 Mike Scyphers, Simi Valley High's suspended baseball coach, filed a grievance 
Friday with the Simi Valley Unified School District, claiming he was suspended 
without proper notice, Scyphers' attorney Brian O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, 41, was suspended May 3, pending police and district investigations 
into possible financial and disciplinary improprieties.The district has 
maintained that Scyphers' right to five days' notice does not apply because he 
was suspended from his job as coach, not as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill said it is now up to the district to resolve the matter or it will go 
to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a time-consuming process," O'Neill said. "It's unlikely this issue is 
going to be resolved during this school year."

FELONY WEAPONS CHARGE FILED AGAINST VAN BUREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors filed a felony weapons charge Friday against Leodes 
Van Buren of Newbury Park High, but the All-State football player maintains he 
is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren declined comment Friday other than to repeat his claim that it was a 
companion who fired a single shot from a handgun into his girlfriend's home in 
Newbury Park last month. 
</P>
<P>
 After twice requesting arraignment postponements to investigate his 
statements, prosecutors charged Van Buren, 18, with one count of shooting into 
an inhabited dwelling, a charge that carries a maximum penalty of seven years 
in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge stems from Van Buren's April 8 arrest on suspicion of firing a shot 
through the back door of Marcie James' home that morning after he reportedly 
engaged in an argument with James. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren promptly reported the incident to a 911 emergency operator and said 
he fired the shot. James called her mother and told her the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next day, Van Buren denied pulling the trigger, saying a companion did 
it. James corroborated his story. James, 19, the mother of Van Buren's 
2-year-old daughter and a pitcher on the Moorpark College softball team, has 
since reversed herself and said that Van Buren fired the shot, according to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has more or less come around to her first story again," said Jim Grunert, 
a Ventura County deputy district attorney. "The fact that she went and recanted 
with Leodes (the day after the shooting), we'll have to deal with that in 
trial." 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 26 in Ventura Superior Court. An 
early disposition conference is scheduled for Friday, at which time Van Buren 
could plead guilty to a lesser charge.  
</P>
<P>
 The status of Van Buren's football scholarship to attend Colorado is 
uncertain, pending the outcome of the case. Van Buren, a 6-foot-1, 190-pound 
wide receiver, led Newbury Park to the Southern Section Division III 
championship last fall. He is the state's all-time leader in receptions and 
receiving yardage.

 The Moorpark College men's track and field team hopes to ride the broad 
shoulders of Isaiah Mustafa and Sean McKeown to a top-five finish in the 
Southern California junior college championships at UC San Diego today. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other Moorpark athletes have qualified for the meet, but Coach Doni 
Green admits that the multitalented Mustafa and McKeown must turn in solid 
performances if the Raiders are to finish in the top five for the third 
consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark enters today's competition with 11 points in the team standings as a 
result of second- and sixth-place finishes by Mustafa and Kevin Kephart in the 
Southern California decathlon championships last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa will compete in the high jump, long jump and 1,600-meter relay. 
McKeown will see triple duty in the shotput, discus and hammer throw. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Gurman (1,500), Mike Esparza (3,000 steeplechase), Brady Mertes (shotput 
and discus) and Manfred Wagner (hammer) also have qualified in individual 
events for Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The top four finishers in the relays and in each race up to 800 meters 
automatically qualify for next week's state championships at Cerritos College.  
</P>
<P>
 The fastest fifth-place finisher in those events from either the Southern and 
Northern California championships also will advance. 
</P>
<P>
 The top six finishers will advance in races measuring 1,500 meters or farther 
and in the field events. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top local performers in the men's meet are Isaac Turner (800) and Jeremy 
Gump (pole vault) of Glendale, Rob Landtiser (400 intermediate hurdles) of 
Canyons, and Jesse Polsten (hammer throw) of Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading local entrants in the women's competition are Antelope Valley's 
Teresa Santana (3,000), Susan Doddridge (discus) and Debra Gifford (javelin), 
Ventura's Amy Blackburn (discus) and Josephina Sanchez (3,000), and Glendale's 
Auria Roberto (3,000) and Margarita Reinteria (1,500). 
</P>
<P>
 The field events will start at noon, followed by the running events at 2 p.m.

PIERCE FACES ROUGH ROAD; NO PICNIC FOR MISSION AT HOME

 Mission and Pierce colleges face stiff competition in the Southern California 
junior college baseball Southern regional today and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission (26-15), seeded seventh, will play host to defending state champion 
Rancho Santiago (33-10), and Pierce (26-15) will travel to Harbor (29-12) in a 
pair of best-of-three series.The games today start at noon and doubleheaders -- 
if necessary -- are scheduled for 11 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen teams will play in the first round. This weekend's eight winners will 
advance to the second round on May 21-22 and the four survivors will qualify 
for the eight-team state championships May 28-30 at Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Spirit won the Southern California Athletic Conference title and set 
a school record for victories. However, the team got no favors from the seeding 
committee, drawing No. 10 Rancho Santiago. The Dons lost only two nonconference 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission will pitch right-hander Ray Rivera (12-2, 2.38 earned-run average) 
today. The Dons are expected to counter with right-hander Brandon Hoalton 
(11-2, 2.73). 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, seeded 15th, has to visit Harbor for the second consecutive year in 
the first round. The Seahawks, seeded second, eliminated Pierce in three games 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Seahawk players have committed to Division I schools. One of them is 
right-hander Mark Chavez (9-2, 2.70), who will attend Cal State Fullerton next 
season. He will face Brahma left-hander Adam West (10-4, 2.95) today. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor will be without preseason All-American catcher Jeff Poor, who is 
recovering from stab wounds suffered in a fight at a party, Coach Tony 
Bloomfield said.

INVESTIGATORS CLEAR, ADMONISH CSF; JURISPRUDENCE: PANEL FINDS NO EVIDENCE OF 
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST 15 FORMER TITAN FOOTBALL PLAYERS. SCHOOL TOLD BE MORE 
SENSITIVE TO THEIR NEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A human relations panel investigating complaints of 15 former Cal State 
Fullerton football players found no evidence of discriminatory treatment, the 
school announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But a summary of the 11-member panel's findings said the school needed to be 
more sensitive to student-athletes' needs, particularly when athletic programs 
are discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said charges of racial or ethnic discrimination were "not supported 
by the evidence" but that football players suffered because of a lack of 
communication and the loss of direction and support when football was dropped 
after the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly not surprised," said Bill Shumard, who announced last week that 
he will resign as Titan athletic director effective May 31. "I expected good 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very appreciative of the (panel's) work. Obviously, it's an inexact 
science when you have to drop a sport, a learning curve. Hopefully, we'll all 
learn from this." 
</P>
<P>
 But Matt Pearson, a former Titan linebacker from Oxnard, said the findings of 
the panel weren't valid because of the limitations of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "That group never had the power to investigate anything," he said. "They only 
had the power to hear our side of the story and their side of the story. They 
couldn't investigate the charges and substantiate them." 
</P>
<P>
 The report said it found no evidence to support charges that football players 
were subjected to racial harassment by members of the athletic department or 
provided with inadequate treatment for injuries after the program was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Pearson said, "When a man says something in front of 50 witnesses, that's 
a fact." 
</P>
<P>
 The report also said communication problems were mostly responsible for 
continuing disputes over financial aid between the players and the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson said the players now intend to take the matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is we're being denied financial aid we're entitled to," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To address the problems the panel said it discovered, the report recommended 
development of: 
</P>
<P>
 * A written plan to help students from a discontinued program make the 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
 * A handbook for student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 * A coaches manual or checklist involving issues including recruiting, 
contracts, scholarships, deadlines and academic progress. 
</P>
<P>
 * Multicultural awareness and communication training for athletic department 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 * A system in which student-athletes are encouraged to become more involved 
with the university and all its resources rather than just the athletic 
department. CRAIG STANKE

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (34-10) are led by starting pitchers Aaron France (10-3), Matt 
Hendren (9-2) and Josh Belvosky (7-1). Andy Gonzales, the most valuable player 
in the the conference, was 2-2 with four saves in relief. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

THESE FRIENDS RUNNING IN A PACK AGAIN; BASEBALL: DRIZOS IS DOING FINE AT 
NEVADA, WHERE HE HAS BEEN REUNITED WITH SADDLEBACK COLLEGE TEAMMATE GARCIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Justin Drizos and Neil Garcia were good friends when they played baseball for 
Saddleback College for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They appeared to be going their separate ways last fall, however. Garcia had 
signed with Nevada and Drizos was headed to Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Drizos had hoped it would be different. "I wanted to go to Reno to start with, 
but they took Neil and passed on me," Drizos said. "I think they thought they 
had their first baseman at the time and that was clearly my position." 
</P>
<P>
 Then some things started to happen. When Drizos arrived in Laramie, he learned 
he was missing a half-unit needed to transfer to a four-year school, and would 
have to pick it up at a community college. He did that, but the scholarship 
help he had been expecting wasn't available there. He also spent enough time at 
Wyoming's fall practices to know that he wasn't sold on the program. And then 
there was the brutal winter weather. While the Californian shivered in the 
cold, he stewed emotionally. "It was so cold you couldn't go outside very much 
and I got cabin fever," Drizos said.  
</P>
<P>
 After a few phone calls to his old buddy Garcia, Drizos was asking the Nevada 
coaches if they could somehow find a spot for him with the Wolf Pack. They did, 
and they've been delighted with that decision all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Drizos, who played at Woodbridge, is one of the hottest hitters on the 
team. He's batting .371 with four home runs and 36 runs batted in. Drizos, 6 
feet 3 and 200 pounds, also is playing superbly at first base. And Nevada 
(36-10) is ranked 14th in the nation, in the running for the Big West 
Conference championship and setting its sights on the NCAA playoffs. Cal State 
Fullerton regained first place in the Big West with its three-game sweep of New 
Mexico State. Nevada and Long Beach State are tied for second in the conference 
at 13-5 behind the Titans (15-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who played for Foothill, also has been a big part of that success, 
even though he was out several weeks with a torn muscle in his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Drizos ranks fifth in the conference in hitting, and he has been the key 
figure since Garcia was injured. Through a 12-game stretch, Drizos had 27 hits 
in 49 at bats. He hit safely in 14 of the team's last 16 games before Nevada 
opened a three-game series Friday at Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "We liked Justin when he was at the junior college, but we were limited in 
scholarship money at that point," Nevada Coach Gary Powers said. "You can't 
recruit everybody, and we felt one of the returning players could move into the 
first base position. We knew we had a need there, though. Then we had some 
scholarship money open up in the summer when two of our players who had been 
injured decided not to return. When Justin expressed an interest, it worked out 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
 That brought Drizos and Garcia together again. 
</P>
<P>
 And Powers couldn't wait to get them back in the batting order at the same 
time. Garcia returned to the lineup as a designated hitter in the May 8 
doubleheader and had four hits in eight trips to the plate as Nevada took two 
games against San Jose State after a loss May 7. Drizos had two doubles and a 
homer in the doubleheader to go with Garcia's four hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's .414 batting average is the best in the Big West, 10 points ahead of 
second-place Jeff Ferguson of Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need Neil in the lineup to be the team we're really capable of being," 
Powers said. "He's a guy you want up there with runners on base. And Justin has 
really been consistent lately. He got off to a slow start since he didn't play 
in the fall and he had to get his timing back." 
</P>
<P>
 Drizos particularly was pleased that he had a good showing in a homecoming of 
sorts when Nevada played at Fullerton two weeks ago. Drizos' two hits and two 
runs batted in helped Nevada win the opener, 5-2. He came back with two more 
hits and two RBIs in the 7-2 second-game victory. Drizos also managed one of 
only three hits given up by Fullerton's Dan Ricabal in the series finale the 
Titans won, 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put a lot of pressure on myself for that series," Drizos said. "I had 10 
people there, either family members or close friends, so I really wanted to do 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Drizos says a couple of changes have helped his hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Powers had me open my stance and back off the plate a little because I 
was getting jammed a lot on the inside pitches," Drizos said. "This way I have 
more time to turn on the inside pitch and I was able to hit to all fields 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earlier in the season, I was hitting in the low .300s, but I was striking out 
a lot. I was letting too many of the corner pitches go. From that standpoint, I 
went back to my Saddleback days. When I thought a pitch was close, I went for 
it. I had been walking a lot, but I was being too selective." 
</P>
<P>
 Powers is as pleased about Drizos' play in the field as he is with his 
hitting. "Sometimes what gets overlooked about Justin is that he's a tremendous 
defensive first baseman," he said. "He's made plays all year that have really 
helped us. That makes him even more valuable to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Drizos and Garcia are roommates, and Drizos says that being back around Garcia 
has helped him become more focused. "Neil eats and sleeps baseball," Drizos 
said. "He's always going 100%, and, frankly, I know I can slip below that at 
times. We talk baseball all the time and that helps me stay in the right frame 
of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Drizos says that might have been the knock on him from some college 
recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been told that some people thought I lacked desire," Drizos said. "I 
guess I do look relaxed in the field, but defense always has come easy to me. I 
don't know anything else I can do, other than keep my uniform a little 
dirtier." 
</P>
<P>
 At this stage, he feels he has proved himself to anyone who might have doubted 
his chances of being successful in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the Big West has some of the best pitchers in the nation," he said, 
"and everything became easier for me once I saw that I could hit this 
pitching."

 Forgotten Riddle?: The widow of musician Nelson Riddle sued Electra Records, 
saying that label has refused to credit her husband as the original arranger of 
the song "Unforgettable." In a suit filed in Manhattan federal court seeking 
unspecified damages, Naomi Riddle alleges that the company has refused to 
credit her husband for a version of the Nat King Cole ballad recorded by Cole's 
daughter Natalie in 1991. Riddle was listed as the arranger on Nat King Cole's 
1953 version of the song.

 * First Fan: Barbra Streisand said she wanted her concert in Landover, Md., to 
be distinctly "nonpartisan," even though she was playing to an audience that 
included the country's top Democrat -- President Clinton. Clinton nodded to the 
music and flashed a thumbs-up toward the stage Thursday, seeming especially 
taken with Streisand's rendition of "Happy Days Are Here Again," which was 
accompanied by video footage of headlines touting some of his Administration's 
biggest accomplishments. Clinton and the First Lady were surrounded at the 
concert by an entourage of Cabinet members and other high-ranking officials so 
large that a bus was added to the presidential motorcade.

 * Goodby, Norma Jean: The estate of Marilyn Monroe won a temporary restraining 
order blocking the auction of more than 60 items that belonged to the star. The 
estate questioned the ownership of the items, which would have been sold by 
Odyssey Auctions. Included: Monroe's personal address book and a letter that 
contains a reference to a possible relationship between her and Robert Kennedy. 
The auction will still take place today in Hollywood, with other Hollywood and 
rock 'n' roll memorabilia on the block. MOVIES

 Cat's Meows: The voices of Natalie Cole, Scott Bakula, Kathy Najimy, Ed Asner, 
Hal Holbrook and Don Knotts will be featured in an upcoming animated movie, 
"Cats Don't Dance." Described in Friday's announcement as a 1930s-style 
Hollywood musical, it will feature songs by Randy Newman and choreography by 
Gene Kelly. The film is planned for a 1996 release, and will be the second 
animated film from Turner Pictures and David Kirschner Productions. The first, 
called "Pagemaster," is due Christmastime.

 * Thailand Makes 'List': Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List" will premiere 
in Bangkok today, after a reversal by Thailand's Police Censorship Board, which 
had originally objected to the scene with nudity in the Academy Award-winning 
film. The board approved the film for viewing after an appeal by the film's 
distributor, which is bound by Spielberg's demand that the film be shown either 
in its entirety or not at all. Earlier this week, Spielberg's production 
company said it would withdraw all its films from distribution in Malaysia, 
whose censors had refused to show "Schindler's List" unless several cuts were 
made. THE ARTS

 Schedule Changes: The Old Globe Theatre in San Diego has announced two changes 
in its summer schedule. William Congreve's "The Way of the World" will take the 
Aug. 31-Oct. 2 outdoor slot, previously set aside for a compilation of 
Shakespeare's "Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2" -- which will be slated for the 
theater's 60th anniversary season next year. And a revival of David Storey's 
"Home" will play the Cassius Carter Centre Stage Sept. 14-Oct. 23.

 Chicago Pulls Picasso Show: Claiming that key works of art are unavailable for 
loan, the Art Institute of Chicago has canceled plans to present the L.A. 
County Museum of Art's popular exhibition "Picasso and the Weeping Women: The 
Years of Marie-Therese Walter and Dora Maar." The Institute declined to specify 
which loans had fallen through or if the works would be included at other sites 
presenting "Weeping Women." The show -- which opens June 12 at the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art in New York -- was a hit this spring at LACMA, where it was the 
12th best attended exhibition in the museum's 29-year history. QUICK TAKES

 NBC rolled the dice in a big way Friday, ousting its Top 10 freshman hit 
"Frasier" from its potent Thursday lineup and scheduling the show head-on 
against "Roseanne" as the network announced its new fall prime-time schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 In a further breakup of the Thursday lineup, NBC also moved another hit, 
"Wings," scheduling it against "Full House." Both "Roseanne" and "Full House" 
are major, established successes for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 A third show of NBC's vaunted Thursday lineup, "L.A. Law," was previously 
canceled and will broadcast its final original episode next week. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC, once king of prime time but now third in the ratings behind CBS and ABC, 
has been trying to rebuild and is apparently attempting to be aggressive by its 
direct challenge to the two ABC situation comedies. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, NBC has also taken heat in the last year for its decision 
allowing David Letterman to get away to CBS, where he now is No. 1 in 
late-night. And several seasons ago, NBC took further criticism for unloading 
"The Golden Girls," "Matlock," "In the Heat of the Night" and "Night Court" in 
its ongoing rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its attempt to recall past glory, NBC has brought back Bill Cosby, 
once the king of TV comedy whose series was the primary show making the network 
No. 1 in the 1980s. This fall, however, he will star in a one-hour drama, "The 
Cosby Mysteries," as a fellow who solves crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC will also add -- starting this June but continuing as part of the fall 
schedule -- a second weekly edition of its newsmagazine "Dateline NBC." The new 
magazine is called "Dateline NBC II" and will also be anchored by Jane Pauley 
and Stone Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, NBC's new fall series included four comedies, four dramas and 
"Dateline NBC II" -- another of the less expensive, network-owned newsmagazines 
that increasingly are replacing dramas such as "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Bochco, co-creator of "L.A. Law," recently suggested that one of the 
reasons the much-honored, 8-year-old series is being canceled is that it is not 
owned by NBC, which therefore cannot make money from it in syndication or 
foreign sales. "L.A. Law's" production cost has also reportedly risen to about 
$1.6 million per episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, however, the most startling aspect of the fall NBC schedule was the 
breakup of the formidable tandem of "Seinfeld" -- which remains on Thursday -- 
and "Frasier," which was the network's top-rated new series, ranked seventh 
among all shows this season and earned favorable reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 A spinoff of "Cheers," another series that NBC lost last season, "Frasier" 
stars Kelsey Grammer as a radio host who dispenses personal advice on his show. 
NBC may think the show is young, fresh and strong enough to loosen the ratings 
hold of the long-running "Roseanne." It is, nonetheless, a hefty burden to 
place on a series that has had only one season to develop a following. 
</P>
<P>
 Inheriting the choice slot following "Seinfeld" in the fall will be a new 
sitcom, "Madman of the People," which stars Dabney Coleman ("Buffalo Bill," 
"The Slap Maxwell Story") as an irreverent columnist whose new boss at a 
magazine is his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, inheriting the "Wings" slot following "Mad About You" on Thursday 
nights will be another new sitcom, "Friends." It comes from the producers of 
the admired cable series "Dream On" and stars Courtney Cox ("Family Ties") as 
one of "six young adults who are trying to make it in Manhattan." 
</P>
<P>
 With so much at stake for NBC in these two new Thursday comedies, James 
Burrows -- who co-produced "Cheers" and was a major factor in the first year of 
"Frasier" -- was recruited to direct the pilots of both "Madman of the People" 
and "Friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing "L.A. Law" on the Thursday schedule will be a new drama, "E.R.," 
written and produced by author Michael Crichton ("Jurassic Park," "Rising Sun") 
and concerning "a group of young residents who work in the chaotic emergency 
room of a mammoth Chicago general hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, CBS tried a situation comedy with the same title, "E/R," which 
also focused on a hospital emergency room and starred Elliott Gould, but the 
show failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another "Jurassic Park" principal, Steven Spielberg, also fared well on NBC's 
schedule. Despite the disappointing ratings of his new series "seaQuest DSV" -- 
which ranked 81st among 128 shows this season -- that show will return, and he 
is getting a new one to boot, "Earth 2," a futuristic drama. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Earth 2," says the network, the Earth's "population is forced to live in 
gigantic orbiting space stations. (A scientist) organizes a covert expedition 
to a distant planet that she believes could offer a more livable future for all 
humankind." 
</P>
<P>
 Other new NBC series include: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Martin Short Show," a sitcom in which the performer plays a husband and 
father who stars in a TV variety program. Short serves as a writer and 
executive producer. Catherine Hicks portrays his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Young at Heart," a sitcom with Gene Wilder as "a late-in-life father who is 
learning how to cope with raising twin sons." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sweet Justice," an hour drama with Melissa Gilbert and Cicely Tyson as "a 
pair of Southern lawyers determined to champion the underdog." 
</P>
<P>
 The much-praised new drama "Homicide: Life on the Street" also made it back on 
the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC shows from this season that will not return also include: "Against the 
Grain," "Viper," "The NBC Friday Night Mystery," "The Mommies," "Cafe 
Americain," "Nurses," "Winnetka Road," "Getting By," "I Witness Video," 
"Someone Like Me," "Saved by the Bell: The College Years," "The Second Half" 
and "The Good Life." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is NBC's night-by-night lineup for fall: 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday: "Earth 2," "seaQuest DSV," "NBC Sunday Night Movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday: "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," "Blossom," "NBC Monday Night Movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday: "Wings," "The Martin Short Show," "Frasier," "The John Larroquette 
Show," "Dateline NBC." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday: "The Cosby Mysteries," "Now With Tom Brokaw & Katie Couric," "Law & 
Order." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday: "Mad About You," "Friends," "Seinfeld," "Madman of the People," 
"E.R." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday: "Unsolved Mysteries," "Dateline NBC II," "Homicide: Life on the 
Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday: "Young at Heart," "Empty Nest," "Sweet Justice," "Sisters."

POP BEAT: WITH A NEW LABEL AND LINEUP, IT'S NEW TIMES FOR FEMMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Add it up: 12 years, seven albums now, No. 1 on the list of KROQ listeners' 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
 It equals Violent Femmes, the enduring post-punk trio that has exerted a huge 
influence on younger bands, even though nobody else really sounds like them 
(new artists seem to admire their longevity and independence), and that 
headlines concerts over groups that sell many more records (credit their 
reputation for putting on great live shows). 
</P>
<P>
 Now founding Femmes Gordon Gano and Brian Ritchie are learning subtraction and 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 In the band's first personnel change, drummer Victor DeLorenzo left the group 
last year and was replaced by ex-BoDean Guy Hoffman. The new lineup will appear 
at the KROQ "Weenie Roast" on June 11 at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, playing 
to listeners who recently voted the early anthem "Add It Up" their favorite 
all-time song. 
</P>
<P>
 And after six albums with the Warner Bros.-distributed Slash Records, the 
Femmes have moved to Elektra, which will release their album "New Times" next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a pretty parting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slash had basically shut us down and weren't allowing us to make any more 
music," said Gano, the group's singer and primary songwriter, during a recent 
video-shooting visit to Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "They asked us to make demos," explained bassist Ritchie. "So we did and they 
said that the songs weren't good enough. They said, 'Back to the drawing 
board,' and we said, ' Wrong .' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Slash's president and founder Bob Biggs in a separate interview, "They 
were on a descending ladder (commercially) and we were all trying to figure out 
what to do. It wasn't that we were passing judgment on whether the songs were 
good or bad in some sort of universal sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't just Slash, it was Warners, there was input from producers, and no 
one wanted to do the songs. It just disintegrated in a descending way that 
didn't add to good feelings on anyone's part." 
</P>
<P>
 While the lawyers negotiated a settlement, Gano, Ritchie and Hoffman put up 
their own money, went into a Milwaukee studio and came up with the most 
free-form album in this free-form band's career. 
</P>
<P>
 "New Times" offers a familiar taste of the Femmes' jittery, folk-ish rock, but 
also features long improvisations, songs in a post-modern cabaret style, and 
even two musical theater-like selections using lyrics from a 1930s piece by 
German Dadaist Walter Mehring. 
</P>
<P>
 Gano and Ritchie attribute the adventurousness to the record's producers -- 
Gano and Ritchie. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always found that producers either had a net negative input or neutral 
input, so we didn't think it really made any sense to use a producer," said 
Ritchie.  
</P>
<P>
 "A so-called producer is really usually a baby-sitter for the record company," 
added Gano. "The record company's not interested in having the group make 
strange music, they're interested in the pop side of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "So not having a producer probably encouraged us to let out our greater 
eccentricities -- the streak that runs real deep through the band of being what 
negatively would be called self-indulgent. That's just a part of who we are and 
how we play." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent disruptions weren't the first the Femmes have experienced. In the 
mid-1980s, "business and personal" issues led to a two-year parting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most bands would not have ever gotten back together," said Gano. "Why 
we're here, I think, is that at a certain point we put a priority on the music 
that we were making together and the special sound that the band had. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word, which I'm hesitating to use because it sounds sappy, is 
forgiveness. To be able to forgive some of the hates and problems that come out 
in a certain situation and be able to focus on the music and move forward with 
it."

LAUGHING FOR LETTERMAN; HOW DAVE'S SCOUTS HIT THE CLUBS LOOKING FOR 'LATE SHOW' 
COMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's pretty much been funny business as usual this week for David Letterman, 
with an L.A. twist. Having relocated to Television City for a week's run, Dave 
was heard more than once saying "dude." He and Michael Keaton took a dip in the 
temporary set's shimmering pool. And Lakers great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar took the 
shape of a begoggled (and befuddled) Calvert De Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 It was definitely not business as usual Wednesday night at the Laugh Factory, 
when members of Letterman's staff witnessed a showcase of 16 comics, all of 
whom were putting their best laughs forward at the Sunset Strip club in an 
attempt to win a stand-up slot on a future "Late Show." 
</P>
<P>
 "You get used to all kinds of clubs and all kinds of auditions," comedian Todd 
Glass said after performing, "but this was absolutely nerve-racking. You don't 
want to change what you do too much, but I definitely tried to use the bits 
that I thought Dave would enjoy the most." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though neither Letterman nor "Late Show" executive producer Robert Morton was 
present at the showcase, segment producer Daniel Kellison, the show's chief 
comedy scout, served as their eyes and ears for the night. From a perch in the 
club's balcony, he followed each comic's allotted seven-minute set intently, 
keeping joke-by-joke notes on a legal pad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are a lot of smart comics out there," Kellison explained, "and 
that's basically what we're looking for -- people with a unique sense of humor 
that work above the belt. One of my principal concerns is to stay true to 
Dave's sensibility and the sensibility of the show. The comics have to reflect 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The comics at this showcase represented a range of styles, material and 
experience. The evening moved along quickly, with the packed room responding 
equally well to the brash observations of Blake Clark, the crafty wit of Larry 
Miller and the wilder antics of Eddie Griffin. Chris Rock of "Saturday Night 
Live" fame scored big laughs, along with several lesser-known performers. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Late Show" staffers were not just watching the fun with a cool 
professional eye -- they laughed it up as much as anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Fogel got a roar when he said, "I got stopped for driving alone in a 
car-pool lane. I told the cop that I have no friends and my family doesn't like 
me. I think that should be a valid excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie McFadden had a hit with his descriptions of his asthmatic father trying 
to listen in on his teen phone conversations.  
</P>
<P>
 Young comic Harland Williams broke them up when he talked about finding out 
what he was worth by running his head over a checkout scanner: "Apparently I'm 
worth half a dozen eggs." 
</P>
<P>
 Kellison's laughter isn't enough to guarantee a comic a "Late Show" 
appearance: "There are plenty of times when I may find certain comics very 
funny," he says, "but I also know that there's no way they're going to be right 
for the show." That's because one of his challenges is to find comics whose 
material will entertain Letterman's broader 11:30 p.m. audience, said Kellison, 
who worked on the old NBC show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely trying to appeal to a wider audience, and we're taking into 
account that not everyone's going to appreciate some of the old show's humor. 
Our hope is that the music, guests and comedy will be more accessible. The most 
important thing for the comedy is that it's sharp, clever and clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Comics aren't instantly selected or rejected on the strength of one showcase. 
If Kellison sees potential, he'll work with a comic over a period of time to 
get a perfectly tailored "Late Show" set put together. Morton and Letterman 
then make the final decisions on who gets booked. 
</P>
<P>
 One stand-up vet trying to make the cut at the Laugh Factory was notoriously 
off-color comic Robert Schimmel. "This is the first time I ever tried out for 
Dave's show, and I decided to work clean just to see if I could do it. It felt 
great. I could kill club crowds doing blue material 365 nights a year, but more 
people would see me on Letterman in one night. That's worth being clean for 
seven minutes."  
</P>
<P>
 One of Schimmel's bits included the fine points of fending off a shark attack: 
"They say you're supposed to punch him in the nose, and if that doesn't work, 
poke him in the eye. What if he was just swimming by? He says, 'Ow! Why'd you 
hit me? Look, I wasn't going to eat you, but now I have to. The other sharks 
are watching and it doesn't look good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Club owner Jamie Masada said the high-stakes showcase brought a decidedly 
different mood to the club. "The comics had tremendous energy on-stage and 
tremendous nervousness off-stage. Usually there's a lot of kidding around, but 
tonight was total concentration. I was a nervous wreck myself, hoping that 
everything went well. It was an exciting night."  
</P>
<P>
 Harland Williams said he somehow managed to keep his cool. "I felt like an 
underdog, and I guess that helped me stay relaxed. I played to the audience 
rather than to 'The Letterman People.' I just did what I do and managed not to 
turn into a puddle of gravy." 
</P>
<P>
 Kellison and other "Late Show" staffers liked a lot of what they saw at the 
Laugh Factory, and at a similar showcase last Sunday at the Improv.  
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a crazy week, but it's been fruitful," Kellison said. "I saw 25 
or 30 comics, a lot of whom I've been watching for a while, and several are 
definitely ready for the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Some comics weren't taking any chances. As Todd Glass finished his strong, 
fast-paced set, he squinted up at the balcony. "Watch for me on the Letterman 
show?" he asked with a hopeful grin.

Q&A; TAKING ANOTHER TRIP DOWN THE ISLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been 30 years since the S.S. Minnow ran aground on a piece of Pacific 
landscape known as "Gilligan's Island." And in many ways it and its followers 
are still stuck there.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1964-67 television series created by Sherwood Schwartz has outlived 30 
years of critical abuse to become a pop-culture icon of sorts , a classic study 
of life and profits after prime time.  
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz says he never envisioned anything more than a season or two when he 
developed the show as an escape from writing "The Red Skelton Show." Yet 
"Gilligan's Island" has had as many reincarnations as "The Brady Bunch," 
another creation from Schwartz (who was also the producer of two television 
forgettables, "Big John, Little John" and "Dusty's Trail").  
</P>
<P>
 "Gilligan" has been in nonstop syndication since 1967, is in home video and 
has been the subject of several books. Its story will soon become a feature 
movie and is the basis of a new musical play. "There might even be a laser disc 
of 'Gilligan' somewhere," Schwartz said from San Diego, where he is overseeing 
production of "Gilligan's Island, the Musical," now at The Theatre in Old Town. 
 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How many "Gilligans" have you had? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Your guess is as good as mine. Originally there were 99 episodes over 
three years, and as soon as the show was off the network they went into 
syndication. Then we had two cartoons. There were also three two-hour TV 
specials. "Rescue From Gilligan's Island" was the first of the so-called 
reunion shows on the networks, getting a 54 share. With numbers like that, 
everybody else started to have reunion shows. Five books have come out about 
the show. And the entire three years are on home video. 
</P>
<P>
 Then coming up is a movie for Turner Pictures and a stage musical. It's been a 
cottage industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A musical "Gilligan's Island"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, at The Theatre in Old Town in San Diego. I wrote the book with my son 
Lloyd. My daughter Hope and her husband, Laurence Juber, wrote the lyrics and 
music for our musical. Like I said, it's a cottage industry. In my cottage. We 
are doing the first original stage musical based on a television series. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Wasn't "The Brady Bunch" also a play? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. I was creator and executive producer of "The Brady Bunch" on TV. The 
stage version was done by others, but it was a repeat of the old scripts. The 
"Gilligan" musical is a completely original work with all seven characters and 
18 original songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your "Gilligan" movie had been making the studio rounds for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 A: We could have been the first one out with a movie based upon a television 
series if things had run smoothly. My original script was written 4 1/2 years 
ago. The copyright belongs to the Phil Silvers estate and to Ted Turner. First, 
we had to sell them, and since Ted Turner didn't have a film operation, we went 
first to Disney. Disney finally decided against it. Then we almost had a deal 
at Columbia. Then Paramount got interested, but Columbia threatened to sue, so 
Paramount bowed out. Then Columbia bowed out. The script traveled so much, I 
almost put wheels on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now with the new Turner Pictures company we have the best of all worlds. He 
owns the studio and half the copyright. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You don't own "Gilligan"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I own all the characters I created, thanks to the Writers Guild, so nobody 
can do anything without me. The way it works is: If the copyright owners 
instigate a project, like the movie, then I get a fee as creator. If I 
instigate a project, like the musical, I pay a percentage to the copyright 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: "Gilligan's Island" has never been a favorite of critics. But interest in 
the show is still around. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know about the critics, but the show is a family show, which is 
important to me. Family values mean something, just like they do on my other 
show, "The Brady Bunch." That's what I do, family entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 If you study both "Gilligan" and "Brady," you will see they are based on a 
similar philosophy: that it's possible for different kinds of people to learn 
to live together, either in a family or stuck on an island with no escape. 
</P>
<P>
 I took seven radically different people, a captain, his first mate, a movie 
star, a farm girl, a scientist, a billionaire and his wife and put them on an 
island where they could learn to compromise and live together. It's like the 
world, with its poor nations and rich nations learning to live together. It's 
the same in families where people have to learn how to live together. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did it all start? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I was Red Skelton's head writer for seven years, and I was tired of doing 
Freddie the Freeloader and Clem Kadiddlehopper, so I decided in 1963 to develop 
my own property. When I did my agent made one phone call to CBS. We made a 
presentation and the network bought it. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS wanted Phil Silvers to do another series after "Sergeant Bilko" ("You'll 
Never Get Rich") and gave him a deal to form his own production company, which 
took on my show, "Gilligan's Island." United Artists was a partner with 
Silvers. When Turner bought MGM and United Artists, he got half of "Gilligan's 
Island," and he held onto it when he sold UA. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was "The Brady Bunch" as easy to sell as "Gilligan"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. I wrote the pilot five years after "Gilligan." Then it took 3 1/2 years 
to sell it to ABC. I own that show's characters, too.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did the musical "Gilligan" come about? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I've been working on it for the past 16 years after I saw "Annie" on 
Broadway. Why, I wondered, did that show run so long? The answer was easy: 
three generations of kids growing up with the comic strip. The same thing was 
happening with "Gilligan" through syndication. So I decided to do a musical and 
started working on it with my son, Lloyd. Five years ago, we did a stage 
reading of our script in North Hollywood with just a piano and the actors. A 
director friend of mine saw it and said I should take it to a theater in the 
South that was looking for new musicals. So about two years ago, we staged it 
at the Flat Rock State Theater in North Carolina. Then we took it to Chicago 
for four months. The Theatre in Old Town approached us, and I went there to see 
what was being done there. It's scheduled for a month, and then we'll decide if 
it stays or moves on. We have some interest from two New York producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Besides the musical, you have some movie projects. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Two movies. My son, Lloyd, and I have written and will produce "Gilligan's 
Island" for Turner. And we'll do the same with the feature version of "The 
Brady Bunch" for Paramount. "Brady" is more advanced than "Gilligan." It starts 
production in July. The script is finished, and it's in rewrite. This will be a 
different "Brady." It will show the Bradys with all of their traditional values 
but in the '90s. They remain staunch to their beliefs, even if everyone else 
thinks they're freaks. Guess who wins? 
</P>
<P>
 The "Gilligan" movie will be different from the TV series because of the size 
of the production, and it will have seven major stars. But that won't be ready 
until next year. I also have a reissued book out now from St. Martin's Press, 
"Inside Gilligan's Island," on how the series developed. It brings everything

SUKAY FINDS BRIDGE INTO THE ANDES; MUSIC: ON ALBUMS SUCH AS 'RETURN OF THE 
INCA,' THE GROUP COMBINES TRADITIONAL COMPOSITIONS AND NEW WORKS. 
</P>

<P>
 Quentin Howard was born in Brooklyn and raised on Elvis and the Beatles. She 
was working as a graphic artist when she went to a folk festival in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on my way out when I heard this sound," she recalls. "Immediately I 
said to myself, 'That is the most beautiful music I have ever heard.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She invited the musicians who'd been playing the music to her house for 
dinner; they ended up staying the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "They left me a flute. I didn't know what end to blow in. But when you get 
that feeling about something, that kind of joy, you know it's your path. I was 
a shy person, but the day I went on stage to perform this music I was . . . 
anything but shy." 
</P>
<P>
 That was 20 years ago. She began playing the kena, or notched flute, in an 
Andean duo soon after, and in 1978 she founded Sukay, a group that plays 
tonight at the San Juan Capistrano Regional Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Flexibility has been one of the band's earmarks, in terms of both personnel 
and format. Recent CDs such as "Return of the Inca" (one of nine the band has 
released) combine traditional music with newly composed works. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like any project that continues over a decade or two, whether it's marriage 
or a music group, you survive with changes," Howard said, "with shocks that 
come at precise moments when things begin to get mechanical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sukay began as a group dedicated to traditional music, like 
ethnomusicologists. And we performed like ethnomusicologists. That went on for 
years, but because it was many Americans' first exposure to this music, it was 
exciting for them. We played twice in Lincoln Center. We played in Carnegie 
Hall.  
</P>
<P>
 "But we came to an impasse. The traditional music goes so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Sukay in 1989 and breathing new life into the group were Eddy Navia, 
formerly with the Bolivian group Savia Andina, and celebrated Argentine 
guitarist Enrique Coria, who'd been involved with more than 100 recordings in 
his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Navia, now Sukay's artistic director, composes what Howard calls "neo-folk" 
music. He also performs on charango , a string instrument traditionally made 
from an armadillo shell; zamponas or pan pipes, and a two-neck charango- guitar 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Howard plays kenas , zamponas , drums including bombos and wangaras , and 
sings. Brothers Mario and Greg Torrico will play zamponas and other wind 
instruments in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that most members of Sukay were born in South America, Howard found that 
some education was in order when they started playing Andean music. "I didn't 
even speak Spanish! I went for a year and a half to the Andes." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, she felt disappointed and lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my conceptions and romantic imaginings were dispelled. It's hard to 
understand the indigenous people. You find a kind of stoic silence. They're not 
conversationalists. I was born in New York City; we're used to relating in a 
certain way. These people are still sensitive to the movements of the earth. 
They are in touch with inner essences. We have evolved another part of 
ourselves to adapt to our fast pace city world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music was the bridge that brought me close. In the words of Joseph Campbell, 
'It opened doors where there were no doors.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She found that in the Andes it's not common for a woman to perform in a band. 
She was accepted, she said, because she came from another culture and because 
the Andeans were honored that anyone from another culture, man or woman, 
appreciated their music. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers asking an Andean woman why there weren't more women players. 
"She said, 'In our culture the women don't have time to play.' But I did my own 
study. They think if a woman plays she won't have any milk for babies. I think 
it's because men like to get together with men. They get together every night 
before the festivals begin. They make new instruments every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard contrasted the ways that music is made here and in the Andes. "The 
magic is that when these people play at their fiestas, they play music that is 
just right for that festival, that unlocks a feeling in which everyone 
collectively participates, and in which the musicians lose their identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, virtuosos pride themselves on their name and fame. There, you get the 
feeling that people pick up an instrument not to say 'look at me' but to lose 
themselves, to somehow enter into other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard -- who refers often to the wild quality of Andean music -- told a story 
that reflected another way that music-making is different there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I left for South America, I was learning the music by listening to 
ethnomusicological recordings. One recording of music from Peru had a rhythm 
I'd never heard before. I asked some more experienced musicians if they could 
tell me what was happening. They said, 'It begins in 4/4, then it goes to 6/8. 
It's very puzzling and very complicated.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I happened to go to the little village where the recording was made. The 
recording had included a photo, and I happened to see the same group 
performing. This is it , I thought. But they played in perfect 4/4 through 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of the festival, however, people had been drinking and drinking, 
and now the (group members) were leaning against the wall of the church. . . . 
they were playing exactly as they'd sounded on the recording." 
</P>
<P>
 * Sukay plays music of the Andes today at 7 and 9 p.m. in the courtyard of the 
San Juan Capistrano Regional Library, 31495 El Camino Real, San Juan 
Capistrano. $3. (714) 493-1752.

THEATER REVIEW; CASTAWAYS KEEP 'GILLIGAN' AFLOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They don't make sitcoms like "Gilligan's Island" anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is a reason, and it's aptly demonstrated by "Gilligan's Island: The 
Musical," now in its West Coast premiere at The Theatre in Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just, well, goofy. Silly. A comic version of "No Exit" mixed with a 
child's-eye view of the American melting pot. From 1964 to '67, while the 
country was tearing itself apart over the Vietnam War, seven castaways from 
varied walks of life -- rich, poor, stupid, smart, sexy and naive -- spent 99 
episodes sparring, bonding and trying to get off a desert island. 
</P>
<P>
 In all that time their hair never got mussed, their clothes (particularly the 
evening gowns) never showed wear, their grass huts appeared as if by magic, and 
the makeup, the food and the jokes never ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 For those of you who were on a desert island for those years, the castaways 
are, as the sitcom's theme-song goes: "Gilligan, the Skipper, too / The 
Millionaire, and His Wife / The Movie Star / The Professor and Mary Ann." 
</P>
<P>
 If you are a "Gilligan's Island" fan or simply want to relive a slice of 
Americana, you are in luck. The production and performances at The Theatre in 
Old Town couldn't be sharper. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the "Gilligan's Island" cookbook, written by Dawn Wells, the 
original Mary Ann, are being sold in the lobby. And series creator Sherwood 
Schwartz, who hopes to take this show off-Broadway, also is reportedly at work 
on "Gilligan's Island: The Movie." 
</P>
<P>
 If, however, you never worshiped at the Gilligan shrine, this won't convert 
you. Despite some mild attempts at self-parody, it is ultimately an 
affectionate re-creation of a simple show with new but simple songs (by 
Laurence Juber, a former lead guitarist of Paul McCartney's band Wings, and his 
wife, Hope, who also happens to be Schwartz's daughter). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The whole thing is held together by a simple view of humor -- the comedy of 
opposites with the requisite stupid jokes, rich jokes, egghead jokes, sexpot 
jokes, each directed at the appropriate one-note character. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz wrote the book with his son and frequent collaborator, Lloyd J. 
Schwartz. It's essentially a two-hour Gilligan episode complete with a creature 
from outer space. 
</P>
<P>
 While their strong presence can be felt here (they and their fellow 
collaborators all attended opening night), much credit for the silky smoothness 
of the show goes to the deft hand of director Paula Kalustian. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalustian, the artistic director of The Theatre in Old Town, elicits 
picture-perfect performances from her Equity cast, which doesn't have a weak 
link. 
</P>
<P>
 As millionaire Thurston Howell III, company regular Steve Anthony, who did the 
witty choreography with wife Jill K. Anthony, has the mannerisms of his TV 
series predecessor, Jim Backus, down pat. He and Ginger Prince as Mrs. Howell, 
milk the Juber song "It's Good to Be Rich" for every comic nuance. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen Sudduth oozes sex as Ginger in "Natural Phenomenon," drawing out a 
truly inspired reaction from Tom Hafner, who gets his own brilliant comic solo 
as the Professor with "The Professor's Lament." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Rosen offers some first-rate physical stumbling as the hapless Gilligan. 
Paul James Kruse provides a strong voice and comic foil as Skipper. Tracy 
Venner, a big voice in a little body, bears the same cross as the original Mary 
Ann -- always the straight man, never the comic -- but handles it with sweet 
grace. 
</P>
<P>
 The set design by Nick Reid -- painted cutout palms, plastic jungle leaves and 
the inevitable "Hut Sweet Hut" fit the mood perfectly. The bright, bold and 
basic costume designs by Ardith Gray similarly evoke those in the original. And 
Terry O'Donnell's musical direction does about as well as it can with the 
limitations of the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Can "Gilligan's Island: The Musical" make it in New York? Probably not if you 
depend on the kindness of New York critics. But if "Gilligan's Island: The 
Musical" has a good chance at flourishing with anyone, it should be with 
audiences who can't wait for the movie version of "The Flintstones." 
</P>

'WALKER' MARKS A YEAR OF FIGHTING INJUSTICE ON CBS; TELEVISION: DESPITE 
CONTROVERSY OVER TV VIOLENCE, CHUCK NORRIS' ACTION SERIES BEAT THE COMPETITION 
IN ITS TIME SLOT AND HELPS THE NETWORK ENSURE ITS TOP SPOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The star seemed a natural for television popularity, but the timing appeared 
touchy when Chuck Norris' one-hour series, "Walker, Texas Ranger," was launched 
on CBS last year. 
</P>
<P>
 An action series headlining the karate and film veteran, the show arrived on 
the network just as a national furor was building over TV violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure did," Norris acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the actor drew a sizable audience in his 10 p.m. time slot on 
Saturday, normally the weakest night for network TV. "Walker, Texas Ranger" 
ranked 47th among 128 prime-time network series this season, earning a solid 
21% share of the viewing audience and beating out its head-on competition, 
ABC's "The Commish" and NBC's "Sisters." 
</P>
<P>
 The Norris series, which deals with a modern-day Texas Ranger whose 
crime-solving techniques are -- in CBS' words -- "in the rugged traditions of 
the Old West," helped the network secure a lock on Saturdays, paired with 
another tradition-oriented program, Jane Seymour's "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman." 
 
</P>
<P>
 By suddenly turning Saturday night back into a viable viewing entity, CBS also 
helped ensure its third consecutive year as the ratings leader, based mainly on 
a four-day stretch each week -- Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays. It is 
during these days that the network airs such hits as "60 Minutes," "Murder, She 
Wrote," "Murphy Brown," "Northern Exposure," "Rescue 911" and the weekly Sunday 
and Tuesday movies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ratings success of "Walker, Texas Ranger" amid the controversy over TV 
violence -- with the government issuing threats to the industry about 
programming -- is no surprise to Norris. This season, at least, both he and CBS 
-- which has an older and probably more conservative prime-time audience -- may 
well have tapped into mainstream concern about crime and dealing with it 
directly. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris doesn't think his show is violent. He speaks of "justifiable force" to 
combat injustice. And if there is a surprise about the series to those who 
thought it might provoke anti-violence protests, it is that "Walker, Texas 
Ranger" hasn't caused much controversy at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the show's action, Norris, who has a home in Tarzana and a ranch in 
Navasota, Tex. -- about three hours from Dallas, where the show is filmed -- 
says: "It's how it's done. I don't advocate violence for violence's sake. What 
Walker does is fight injustice. What people hang on to is that the good guy 
wins in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "There haven't been a lot of action shows on, like 'Magnum, P.I.,' in a long 
time. But people want to see good win out over evil. If you're walking out of a 
restaurant and you're accosted, you'd love to have the ability to deal with the 
situation if you had to." 
</P>
<P>
 Norris, who was born Carlos Ray in Ryan, Okla., the son of an Irish-English 
mother and Cherokee father, moved to Torrance with his family when he was 12. 
Nowadays, with his main home in Texas, he focuses much of his attention on his 
Kick Drugs Out of America Foundation, which he set up in 1990 and which focuses 
on youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now (involved in) 12 schools and have had about 1,500 kids in our first 
three years. We teach the martial arts during physical education. We found that 
kids start veering one way or the other when they're about 11, 12 or 13, so we 
began focusing on sixth, seventh and eighth grade kids to give them an 
alternative to gang involvement. It's about 40% girls and 60% boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teaching martial arts teaches them the discipline that many kids are lacking 
today. You see shows in prime time, like 'Cops,' that show reality on the 
streets. And there are others that I think are not healthy for kids to see on 
the air. Lots of times you see what the bad guy does, but you don't see him 
getting his due. It's important that kids today realize they can't get away 
with things. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I thought that 'Walker' had any kind of devastating effect, especially on 
kids, I wouldn't do this series. I don't need this series. I make more money on 
films than on TV. I've turned down five films so far during the show. And in a 
film, I work just eight weeks instead of nine months." 
</P>
<P>
 Then why did he take on the series? 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps me closer to my home and my foundation." 
</P>
<P>
 Did he get any warnings from CBS prohibiting potential violence on the show? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They never said anything to me. I told them, 'If I can't do it the way I feel 
it's right, I don't want to do the series.' I've been in this business for 20 
years. They left me alone. They didn't bother me. I talked with (CBS 
executives) Peter Tortorici and Jeff Sagansky, and they said, 'Go for it.' They 
backed me all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I got letters saying the show was violent, I'd have toned it down, but I 
don't get those kinds of letters. There is a difference between action and 
violence. The characters I play portray their skills only as a last resort." 
</P>
<P>
 While "Walker" is distinctly traditional rather than hip or trendy, Norris 
maintains it is also "a positive form of entertainment that doesn't leave you 
depressed at the end. That's what people are looking for. Why are comedies so 
big?" 
</P>
<P>
 But "to be truthful," he says, he rarely watches episodic television, 
preferring to tune in the news. Besides, he says, he is getting involved in 
various business ventures, here and abroad, capitalizing on his name, his 
martial arts skills and international reputation. For instance? 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to Moscow about two years ago. I got invited to a kick-boxing event 
and saw great opportunities there. We're in the middle of (attempting) a 
casino-nightclub combination." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he says, his projects include possibilities in interactive TV, 
games and martial arts stores around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are," Norris says, "other things I want to do rather than sit in front 
of a TV set." 
</P>
<P>
 * Tonight's "Walker, Texas Ranger" is a two-hour episode that begins an hour 
earlier than usual, at 9 p.m. on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).  
</P>
<P>
 'If I got letters saying the show was violent, I'd have toned it down, but I 
don't get those kinds of letters. There is a difference between action and 
violence. The characters I play portray their skills only as a last resort.'

2 ARTISTS WHO ARE QUICK ON THEIR FEAT; JAZZ: FAST REACTIONS ARE NOTHING NEW FOR 
SINGER SUE RANEY AND PIANIST-BANDLEADER JOE MASSIMINO, WHO WILL GIVE A CONCERT 
TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME, TONIGHT AT ORANGE COAST COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Sue Raney and Joe Massimino appear tonight at Orange Coast College, the 
singer and the pianist-bandleader will have only known each other, musically 
speaking, for about seven hours. Their first rehearsal for the concert takes 
place today at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Raney admits that she's not completely at ease with the situation. "It should 
be fun, but there is that anticipation when you work with someone for the first 
time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the short preparation time will probably have little or no effect on 
these two veteran pros. That's because both Raney and Massimino, who will lead 
his Big Band tonight, are highly skilled artists who have a good deal of 
respect for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw Sue at Orange Coast College a couple of years ago, and I was 
impressed," Massimino said over the phone from his home in Tustin. "I have a 
great admiration for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Raney has never heard Massimino play, but she's heard about him. "I've been 
told he's wonderful," said the singer, reached at her home in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Raney and Massimino know about having to work quickly. As a teen-ager, 
Raney sang on the "Jack Carson Show" on CBS radio. Then, after a stint as a pop 
vocalist, she worked in Los Angeles TV studios as a jingle composer and singer. 
These occupations call for the ability to react quickly to sudden changes in 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 For 14 years, Massimino was musical director for "The Mike Douglas Show," the 
syndicated TV variety program that went off the air in 1982. "Usually, someone 
like Ben Vereen would come in at 10 a.m., we'd select some material, I'd go and 
arrange it, we'd rehearse," and then they'd go on the air that afternoon, 
Massimo recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, he'd have to work even faster. "An act might drop out an hour 
before airtime, and I'd have to write an arrangement of a medley of songs for 
Mike to sing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how Raney and Massimino will prep for tonight's affair: At 1 p.m., the 
two will "talk over material, run over intros and endings, and any other 
intricate stuff," Massimino explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to make sure we know what each other is doing," Raney added. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 3:30 p.m. run-through with Massimino's Big Band, the headliners will 
be ready. "We'll have it down," Massimino said confidently. "It's a long day, 
but I want it to be right." 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino, who brings along such stellar talent as guitarist Ron Eschete, 
bassist Luther Hughes, drummer Chuck Flores, trombonist Alex Iles and reedman 
Ray Pizzi, will open the show with a quartet (members to be announced), then 
spotlight his Big Band. Raney then steps up, singing such classics as 
"Bluesette" (arranged by Bill Holman) and "You Must Believe in Spring" 
(arranged by Peter Matz). 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why she stuck with standards, Raney said: "When I first started to 
record, I wasn't able to sing these kinds of songs. The record companies wanted 
me to have a hit record, so I did bubble-gum pop, country, a little rock, tunes 
with mass appeal. Later, when I recorded for Albert Marx at Discovery, I got 
(the) chance" to do classic material. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Massimino and Raney have busy schedules. Raney, who sings May 24 with 
Bill Watrous' Big Band at the Moonlight Tango Cafe in Sherman Oaks, stays 
active in the studios. She supplied a vocal track for actress Kathy Baker, who 
plays a singer in the Showtime movie "Lush Life," which will air Friday. "I 
helped her learn to lip-sync the part," Raney said. This fall, the singer 
travels to Israel to appear with Michel LeGrand's orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino, besides working in his Sierra Digital recording studio in Tustin, 
now performs solo piano Mondays and Tuesdays at 21 Oceanfront in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play everything from Broadway tunes to be-bop," he said. "People come up 
and request stuff. It's sort of like 'Stump the Piano Player.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Raney and the Joe Massimino quartet and Big Band appear tonight at 8 in 
the Robert B. Moore Theatre, Orange Coast College, 2701 Fairview Road, Costa 
Mesa. Tickets, $13-$15. Information: (714) 432-5880.

FAMILY; 'WHEN I GROW UP' DAZZLES THE CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 It's loud -- the amplification of sibilants on the prerecorded soundtrack 
nears wince level. It's modest but glitzy -- the lights onstage could probably 
illuminate a small town. And, out in the lobby, Elmo flashlights, Big Bird 
pennants, T-shirts, posters, buttons and more are raking in the bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the elegant Pasadena Civic Auditorium, one of four local stops for the 
latest "Sesame Street Live!" musical for children, the gentle, more altruistic 
spirit of the TV show shines through as Big Bird, Elmo, Grover, Cookie Monster 
et al put on a "When I Grow Up" pageant about Muppet career aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 Charming song-and-dance numbers range from "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" 
(Telly wants to play baseball) to "Teddy Bear's Picnic" (Bert and Ernie want to 
be forest rangers). Oscar and Grundgetta flounce in tutus to "The Nutcracker" 
and Cookie Monster's rousing '50s rock number, "Shakes, Burgers and Fries," is 
a show-stopper. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar's "I Love Trash" and the "Sesame Street" theme song are obvious 
favorites and audience participation -- from parents too -- is a big part of 
the show, from sing-alongs to marching in place to tooting like a train 
whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 The show has an affirming message, naturally. Elmo wants to be everything and 
that's OK. Big Bird, the show's Everykid, can't come up with anything to be, 
and that's OK too. Besides, he's been such a big help to his friends that they 
couldn't do the show without him. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you think about watching adults in Muppet guise cavort on stage, 
there's no denying the thrill for children who greet the entrance of each 
familiar character with roars of delighted recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 * "When I Grow Up," today and Sunday at Pasadena Civic Auditorium, 300 E. 
Green St. Thursday through May 22 at the Anaheim Pond, 2695 E. Katella Ave. May

TV REVIEW; A FLAWLESS PERFORMANCE IN MEDICAL SAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No misery is dire enough that it cannot be mined for a "fact-based" TV movie, 
but once in a while a true-life experience makes it to the small screen 
compellingly rendered and untarnished by the stain of exploitation. If you miss 
"My Breast," starring Meredith Baxter in a flawless performance, you miss one 
of TV's rare triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on writer-reporter Joyce Wadler's book, a forthright chronicle of her 
own experience with breast cancer, the well-made film, written by Wadler and 
directed by Betty Thomas, draws viewers into a life changed but not defeated by 
illness -- without saintly heroics or funereal hush. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wadler, whose roller-coaster ride through diagnosis of a malignant breast 
tumor, surgery and recovery led to a fortunately happy resolution, Baxter gives 
a transcendent performance. 
</P>
<P>
 By turns vulnerable, sensual, humorous, angry and frightened, Baxter submerges 
one of TV's most recognizable celebrities in a visceral, intimate complexity of 
genuine emotion. Her ache-in-the-throat restraint, the stillness of fear and 
tension-breaking wisecracks -- this could be you, your sister or your best 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter even comes close to making Wadler's frustrating fragile neediness for a 
philandering boyfriend understandable. Jamey Sheridan does a good job with the 
thankless role. Others in the fine supporting cast are Barbara Barrie as 
Wadler's feisty mom, and Sara Botsford and James Sutorius as Wadler's close 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching this frank two hours, women may find themselves pondering their 
own priorities. It's a certainty that many not only will be spurred to begin 
regular breast exams but also will find themselves giving uneasy thought to 
health-care options. Wadler had security that most women do not: A writer for 
People magazine when her cancer was diagnosed, she was given sick leave with 
full pay and full insurance coverage.

 Campaign funds -- Based on errors in campaign finance reports, The Times in 
its May 10 editions incorrectly stated the amount a candidate for state 
superintendent of public instruction had loaned to her campaign. Of the 
approximately $67,000 Gloria Matta Tuchman had raised by the mid-March 
reporting deadline, $19,350 was in loans from herself and her husband.

 W.R. Lazard -- A story Friday about the death of Wall Street investment banker 
Wardell Lazard contained incorrect details about a pending investigation of his 
firm, W.R. Lazard & Co.The probe by the Manhattan district attorney's office 
centers on several transactions involving the New York state Job Development 
Authority in which the firm appeared to have received unusually large 
commissions for the type of work performed. In one transaction involving 
interest rate swaps, the firm received a commission of about $540,000, 
according to Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the district attorney's office. 
Officials of the firm declined to comment.

 Maurice Martine's tables and lamps are not just your ordinary boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, they are precision-engineered cubes that are funky, functional and 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Martine, who has been an Orange County resident for 47 years, says the secret 
to his success lies squarely on his three-way mitered joint system. 
</P>
<P>
 With this system, Martine developed Cube Concepts -- a collection of 
lightweight sturdy cubes made of medium-density fiberboard in which all six 
sides are finished. The open- or closed-framed cubes, which have weighted 
bottoms, come in an array of color combinations and can be laminated. 
</P>
<P>
 And by varying one dimension, Martine can customize the surface of a table 
cube or add drawers to make an end table or modular system. Among the unusual 
-- and, it turns out, popular -- variations of Martine's cube is the toilet 
paper dispenser. The top of the cube serves as a small table, and on one side 
is the tissue dispenser; an opening on top provides a handhold that makes the 
cube easy to move around. 
</P>
<P>
 Cube tables cost $275 to $395; the tissue holder is $295. Cube table lamps are 
$275 to $325. Martine sells the cubes at his South Laguna studio. Call (714) 
499-9931. Fighting Weeds 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling weeds from your landscaping and garden can be a tedious process, not 
to mention torture on your back. BioBlock and Weedblock by Easy Gardener Inc. 
in Waco, Tex., are products designed to control weed growth from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 BioBlock, made from 100% recycled fibers, is a biodegradable barrier that 
never needs to be removed. It also helps conserve moisture in the soil with 
"micro channels" that allow air and water to pass through its roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Weedblock is made of continuously spun and woven fibers that have "micro 
funnels" that taper at the bottom to block out more than 95% of the light that 
weeds need to thrive, while allowing air and water to pass through. Weedblock 
can also be used under walkways, patios, trees and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
 BioBlock (3 foot by 25 foot for $5) and Weedblock (4 by 50 for $20, 4 by 100 
for $40 and 6 by 50 for $30) are available at home and garden centers 
throughout Orange County. Pillow Talk 
</P>
<P>
 Silk, velvet, Ultrasuede. 
</P>
<P>
 These soft, sensuous fabrics provide the foundation for the Ann Gish 
collection of decorative pillows. 
</P>
<P>
 Gish, of Newbury Park, imports fine fabrics for her 3-year-old collection, 
which includes table linens, lounge wear and bedroom ensembles that have a 
flair for the dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 New in her spring line is the Sea Flower pillow, which exudes a flowing effect 
through texture and shape. Created to look like an anemone in full bloom, the 
fabrics are spiraled in folds, and they move like a flower underwater. 
</P>
<P>
 The pillows (16- or 20-inch sizes for $120 and $160) are available in crushed 
dupioni, a combination of smooth and textured silks, or crushed Charmeuse, a 
satiny lightweight silk. And they're washable, too. 
</P>
<P>
 They can be purchased in Orange County at Between the Sheets, Appointments at 
Newport and I. Magnin in Fashion Island Newport Beach, S. Michael David in 
Laguna Niguel and Barneys New York at South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa.
