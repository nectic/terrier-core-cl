 The streak resumes: Don't know if you heard but, a 21-year-old UCLA student 
was arrested for streaking Saturday evening during the Bruins' football game 
with Tennessee in usually staid Pasadena. The nudenik, identified as Gabor 
Fabian, said he was paying homage to the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, young readers may be shocked to find out that many of the oldsters and 
middle-agesters of today were caught up in an epidemic of streaking in the 
early months of 1974 as a sort of spontaneous revolt against winter. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 6 of that year, for instance, a wire service reported that "thousands 
of nude students romped across the nation's campuses. . . ." A man streaked the 
California Angels opener in 37-degree weather in Chicago. A reader wrote to The 
Times that he had been streaking every morning for years because his newspaper 
delivery man rarely threw the paper near his door.

 Three students who gamboled in their birthday suits at Ambassador College were 
sentenced to probation by a judge who recited an old English saying: "Do

<P>
 The fad reached its peak during the 1974 Academy Award ceremonies, when an 
artist named Robert Opel appeared briefly on stage in the nude, violating the 
black-tie dress standard. After Opel vanished, Academy Award presenter David 
Niven got in the last word. Niven said the streaker had revealed nothing but 
"his shortcomings."

FEDERAL RESERVE AND JOBLESS RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Fed's Decision Tied to 'Natural' 6% Jobless Rate," Aug. 29: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure every member of the 120-million-plus American work force is heartened 
that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's policy is that the economy 
must maintain at least 8 million American workers unemployed in order to be 
"natural." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, when interest rates were 
closer to 3% and inflation about 1.5%, it was considered that "natural" 
unemployment was 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican "natural" rate of 6% is aimed at controlling the power of labor 
unions and giving Republicans greater opportunity to criticize welfare, which 
is caused by unemployment. "Kill two birds with one stone," so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 BRYAN W. STEVENS 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * There is nothing natural about unemployment. Rather, it is the creation of 
our capitalist social system. To accept our current rate of unemployment as the 
best we can do is to essentially write off the components of that unemployment 
rate, including the 10% unemployment rate of Los Angeles and the 20%-plus rate 
of South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if we move beyond the economic stagnation of California to look at the 
national picture, economists who see us at the precipice of dramatically high 
inflation really haven't paid much attention to labor markets recently. The 
only workers whose pay goes up regardless of unemployment (and profits) seem to 
be CEOs. Most working Americans' wages have not kept up with inflation for the 
past 20 years! As our manufacturing job base has diminished, those with high 
school educations have seen their pay fall the most. However, in recent years 
we now realize that even the college educated are finding the job market tough. 
</P>
<P>
 These difficulties demonstrate that the private sector is increasingly 
incapable of providing quality jobs. Very few workers are in a position to 
leverage employers into doing so. As a result, only those wearing 
hallucinogenic spectacles like Greenspan can see inflation on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * Typically, economists focus on part of the picture and ignore the rest.  
</P>
<P>
 The 6% statistical unemployment figure represents an actual unemployment rate 
of 10% or more. These theorists are proposing that over 10% of our population 
should support themselves by government programs or criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Not too long ago, economists were wringing their hands over the budget 
deficits and the national debt. If they accept 25 million people on welfare, 
unemployment, or committing crimes, doesn't that make the debt and deficit 
continue their upward spiral? 
</P>
<P>
 In the Aug. 29 Times Business section, James Flanigan states that the cost of 
a single individual who turns to crime instead of earning wages is "millions" 
over a lifetime. The total cost to the taxpayer of an individual choosing a 
life of crime over honest labor is thus far greater than the money he needs for 
subsistence. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a strange world when important public officials believe that people 
having good jobs is more of a threat to our national well-being than poverty 
and crime.  
</P>
<P>
 DAVID S. ROBINSON

their realm of virtual reality into the ranks of the 6%.

 * It does not surprise me (although it does sadden me) that the oligarchs on 
the Federal Reserve Board have given up the battle to keep Americans employed. 
After all, they have jobs. It's natural that they should be more concerned 
about inflation than employment. But I doubt that the people of this country 
will look away as blithely as the Fed when almost one of 15 citizens has no 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unconscionable that an unelected body that must answer to neither the 
President nor the Congress has so much control over our economy. It is time the 
American people took that control back from the Federal Reserve.

 * Re "Fed Hikes Interest Rates Again; Blow to Recovery Feared," Aug. 17: 
</P>
<P>
 It's a shame when the Federal Reserve Board thinks it's more important to 
control prices than it is to let as many people as possible work. Is it better 
for everyone to pay a little more for something, or for some people not to be 
able to afford to buy anything at all? The choice should be obvious. Once 
again, it's a case of the haves versus the have-nots, the rich getting richer, 
and the poor getting poorer. 
</P>
<P>
 It also shows how crime and economic issues are intertwined. Is it a crime 
when the have-nots strike back, or is it a crime what old Mr. Greed-span is 
doing? It's a shame.

ARCO FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Due to lower oil prices and other factors related to the long-term future of 
our business, Arco is cutting back. We're reducing expenses and staff 
throughout our operations worldwide. But we are not withdrawing from our strong 
community involvement in cities such as Los Angeles. Nothing could be further 
from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Since our grant-making budget is tied to our profits and therefore 
considerably diminished in recent years, we decided that the community affairs 
staff, including those assigned to the Arco Foundation, could be reduced with 
minimal impact on our ability to make intelligent grants that provide needed 
help to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Our confidence rested on the fact that the Arco Foundation, while an important 
program, is only part of a much broader community affairs effort. We also make 
direct corporate contributions and have heavy volunteer involvement by senior 
executives and many other employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, as your editorial (July 23) and other coverage indicated, our 
announcement triggered deep alarm in the philanthropic community. If Arco, 
historically a leader in corporate giving, was drawing back, would other 
companies follow? 
</P>
<P>
 We were surprised by the reaction. Arco has deliberately chosen a high 
community profile since we relocated to Los Angeles in 1972. And although much 
has changed in the oil business over the past 22 years, especially in terms of 
oil prices and profits, the key to our thinking continues to be a balance 
between the requirements of our shareholders and the needs of communities where 
our employees live and work. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, we continue to believe deeply in our obligations to society. 
We are not trying to distance ourselves from the problems challenging L.A.'s 
future. That's hardly possible. We're involved, after all, in everything from 
air quality issues to the causes of civil unrest that gutted our neighborhoods 
not many months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Today we have a highly skilled, though somewhat smaller Foundation staff. They 
have the total backing of Arco senior management, and I have a feeling they 
will do well as they continue to invest in solutions to our deep social 
problems, particularly with respect to young people in the inner city. In this 
and other ways, we will continue to emphasize and encourage Arco's social 
commitments.

CAMPAIGN FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding George Skelton's column of Aug. 22, referring to political 
contributions and the 20th anniversary of Proposition 9: The focus of the 
article is the still-continuing need to reform political contributions from 
public interest groups and special interest lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 The "liberals," synonym for socialists (Democrats), want public financing 
(another synonym, this time for taxpayer financing) as the sole source for 
funding of political campaigns.Republicans, according to the article, tend to 
favor limiting the size of contributions. The reality is that political 
campaign spending has run amok. Only an absolute, across-the-board cap on 
candidates' campaign spending within a specific, shortened campaign time span 
is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 With respect to special interest lobbyists, seven out of 10 American voters 
belong to at least one association; one in four belongs to four or more. 
Special interest politics is no longer "special." It is a mass movement.

HOLLYWOOD SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Jeers to the members of the Hollywood Sign Trust (Aug. 24). They are missing 
a good bet. In the article describing the increased security measures being 
taken to protect the sign is a mention of the fact that most people coming up 
to the sign are simply curious tourists, not vandals, and that the "path" which 
seems to beckon them up to the sign is going to be planted over. 
</P>
<P>
 What a waste -- for everyone! Why not simply improve the path, put a gate 
across it and charge admission. They could also install an information and gift 
booth at the top. This way they could earn money for upkeep and maintenance and 
to pacify any grumbly homeowners who feel their privacy is being challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 This way they could enhance both the fame of the sign and of Hollywood itself.

TROUBLE IN WATER PARADISE; WEEKEND FATALITIES SUGGEST STATE LEGISLATORS SHOULD 
CONSIDER TIGHTER BOATING REGULATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To many recreational boaters, California's expanse of ocean and abundance of 
picturesque lakes and rivers surely give the impression of unlimited space and 
freedom. But boaters must recognize that more vessels are taking to the state's 
waters every year, demanding ever-greater safety consciousness on their part, 
plus tighter regulations to encourage responsible conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer number of boats -- more than 825,000 are registered in California -- 
has significantly increased the potential for accidents. So have greater power 
and speed: Some boats now can exceed 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent decades, tougher laws, more aggressive enforcement and better boater 
education programs have helped to decrease boating-related fatalities across 
the nation. However, California, along with some other states, still has a way 
to go.  
</P>
<P>
 Deaths occurred in two separate incidents in Southern California over the 
Labor Day weekend. On Sunday a 24-foot motorboat carrying 19 -- 14 of them 
children -- capsized just outside Los Angeles Harbor. One boy drowned and an 
infant girl was hospitalized later in critical condition. Coast Guard officials 
are investigating whether the boat was overloaded and whether drinking was 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Sunday, at Castaic Lake a man on a jet ski was fatally injured when he 
was struck, apparently by another jet skier who fled. No state law regulates 
use of jet skis, although they have been prohibited in a number of California 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 One factor cited by authorities in many water-related accidents is alcohol. 
Last year, the Orange County Harbor Patrol arrested 11 people on charges of 
boating while intoxicated -- more than double the number of arrests in 1992. 
Boating while intoxicated is a federal offense, subject to a $5,000 fine and a 
year in prison. It's obvious that drinking and driving don't mix, either on the 
highway or on the water. But less obvious safety matters -- carrying proper 
flares and checking fuel lines and batteries before leaving the dock -- also 
deserve greater attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed laws requiring licensing, education and safety classes as a condition 
for operating water craft have been rejected by the Legislature. As the 
weekend's tragedies suggest, it's time to revisit the issue.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE MTA; SHIFT THE SPENDING TO BUSES; THE RATE INCREASE MAY NOT 
BE DISCRIMINATION, BUT IT IS AT LEAST A MISREPRESENTATION OF THE EFFICACY OF 
RAIL TRANSIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES E. MOORE II, James E. Moore II, USC associate professor of urban and 
regional planning and civil engineering, co-directs USC's Center for Advanced 
Transportation Technologies. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U. S. District Judge Terry Hatter's decision to respond to the Labor/Community 
Strategy Center by freezing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 
bus-fare increase does more than focus public attention on one of Southern 
California's wealthiest, most influential bureaucracies. Even if the MTA 
persuades the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse Hatter, the rules of 
the transit game won't ever be the same. From a public-policy point of view, 
Hatter's restraining order creates new incentives for public agencies to remain 
accountable for the quality of their decisions. It is a new experience for the 
MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Few circumstances more clearly demonstrate the differences between public- and 
private-sector decisions. The fundamental priorities of all organizations, 
public or private, are survival and growth. Private-sector organizations 
accomplish this by providing a competitive product at a market price. If they 
are unsuccessful, the organization does not survive and the firm's resources 
are freed for other enterprises. For private firms, inferior decisions mean 
economic death. 
</P>
<P>
 Public agencies must follow more complicated rules, using costs to justify 
short-term funding requirements and the political process to justify new 
projects. The sales taxes imposed by Los Angeles County Propositions A (1980) 
and C (1990) deliver between $700 million and $800 million per year to the MTA, 
which uses this local-funding commitment to justify its requests for public 
revenue from other sources. The authority returns 25% of Proposition A funds 
and 20% of Proposition C funds to local governments for transit-related 
projects, providing the MTA with considerable control over local transportation 
agendas. It is no surprise that local governments have been quick to endorse 
MTA positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Such consummate command of non-market procedures has provided the MTA with 
more than 10 years of rapid growth and an annual budget in the neighborhood of 
$3.7 billion. Unfortunately, the MTA has no real incentive to control costs or 
to structure transit services to serve those most in need. The large subsidies 
and budgets associated with inefficient projects like rail systems provide very 
perverse temptations for upwardly mobile, growth-minded bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The university research community has been blowing its little ivory whistle 
over such outcomes for 30 years, with no substantive effect. Hatter's action 
may prove much more important. The relevant body of law favors the authority, 
but the scrutiny needed to resolve the suit that prompted Hatter's ruling will 
also serve to pierce the MTA's political smoke screen. 
</P>
<P>
 A close look at the MTA's activities will reveal a thorough disregard for 
external research, a chilling political sophistication and a casual willingness 
to misrepresent the efficacy of rail-transit systems to the electorate; but it 
will not reveal a conscious intention to discriminate in a way that violates 
the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. It is unlikely that the plaintiffs will 
be able to demonstrate that the MTA proceeded with the purpose of 
discriminating against any group. The MTA finds itself in an ironic position. 
The equity argument usually serves the MTA well, allowing the agency to explain 
away impressive inefficiencies in the name of fairness. The special twist in 
this case is that the MTA's standard refrain offers the agency no shelter in 
the case of increased bus fares. Higher bus fares hurt the poor most, and now 
the poor have banded together to hire attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest irony is that the suit, Hatter's stay and the MTA's appeal are 
all unnecessary from a fiscal perspective. The MTA has painted itself partway 
into a rail corner, but the agency still has more spending flexibility than it 
professes. Fully 40% of the revenues generated by Propositions A and C may be 
spent at the MTA's discretion. This is on top of the funds returned to local 
government. The MTA has the latitude to immediately shift some of its rail 
expenditures to the bus system, particularly buses that run on highways. 
</P>
<P>
 As this case suggests, Los Angeles is less likely than most communities to 
tolerate gracefully the mobility squeeze imposed by the bus/rail trade-off. The 
MTA should be much more reluctant than it is to increase the gap between the 
city's haves and have-nots. If the MTA expects to retain its legal monopoly on 
transit services, then the agency will have to scale back its rail projects and 
fund buses and the roads they run on. In the best case, Hatter's restraining 
order will give the agency sufficient political incentive to revisit its 
mission. The alternatives are bleak, including a long-term mobility crisis even 
the resilient citizens of Los Angeles are unprepared to face.

THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT JACKPOT; RIDICULOUS LEGAL AWARDS AND BAD LAWS WON'T FILL 
IN FOR SOCIETAL RESTRAINTS. WOMEN SHOULD SPEAK UP FOR THEMSELVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Of all the legal jargon we've recently created in an attempt to compensate for 
the moral principles jettisoned over the last 30 years, no term is more absurd 
than sexual harassment. People, just like other members of the animal kingdom, 
are attracted to one another to ensure perpetuation of the species. Since 
sexual attraction is such a powerful drive, civilizations have evolved cultural 
norms to modulate it, and these norms are flouted only at great risk. To put it 
another way, sex is fun, but it can have some unanticipated results, and 
societies must come up with taboos to minimize their occurrence. In days of 
yore, a guy had to be ready to put unanticipated results through college or at 
least to teach them the family business before he indulged. Girls didn't get 
off easily either. They were instructed to wear appropriate clothing to avoid 
"leading a guy on" and to eschew excessive indulgence in certain beverages lest 
their innate modesty be washed away. Most people played by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the sexual revolution. Equality demanded that women be free to have 
sex whenever and with whomever they wished. Men no longer felt responsibility 
because women had all the tools to prevent any unintended results of the sex 
act. All of this new freedom was heady except for one thing: Women were 
perceived as having surrendered their moral right to societal protection. 
Overstepping the boundaries was no longer possible; there were no boundaries. 
So women sought protection from unwanted sexual intrusions through the courts. 
And thus was born the term sexual harassment.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, I don't believe anyone, male or female, should have to tolerate behavior 
that makes them uncomfortable. Good manners demand that all of us try to 
respect one another's feelings. But we do seem to be overdoing it a little when 
it comes to taking offense from certain words, gestures and touches. (Rape is a 
crime of a totally different dimension and is certainly not to be considered in 
the same arena as sexual harassment.) Take the case of the 40-year-old San 
Francisco secretary who just hit the jackpot in her suit against a lawyer 
alleged to have inappropriately touched her and to have made lewd comments. 
This lady was able to extract from her touchy boss and all 1,700 of his legal 
associates $7.1 million in punitive damages. I suspect that most of those 
associates had no desire to similarly grope her and were guilty of only the 
remotest of associations with the defendant. Yet all were punished. This case, 
if upheld, could establish a legal precedent with the force of law.  
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of laws, one sits on the desk of Gov. Pete Wilson at this very 
moment. Apparently groups like the National Organization for Women, California 
Women Lawyers and others feel that there is little recourse when people other 
than one's employer grope or make lewd comments. Infliction of emotional 
distress being a hard thing to prove, they've opted to push for a law making 
actionable unwelcome sexual comments uttered in the course of a professional 
relationship such as dentist-patient or collection service-debtor, if the 
plaintiff has requested that these comments cease. Note that no groping need 
take place. The clear implication in this law is a sexist one, namely that 
males are the professionals and females the clients. In point of fact, most 
women doctors in a recent study reported instances of "sexual harassment" by 
one or more of their patients. According to this law, these physicians could 
sue their patients for three times the financial loss they incur through this 
harassment. But who would be sued? The patient's managed-care plan? Blue 
Cross/Blue Shield? Medicare? Badly written laws that attempt to make up for the 
shortcomings of a society that has thrown away its natural decorum concerning 
sexual matters can only do more harm than good. They make people vulnerable to 
false accusations, present the risk that misinterpretation of a casual comment 
may result in litigation and promote the Victorian image of women as frail and 
fragile flowers who swoon when four-letter words are in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's fight the battle that needs to be fought, for equality of opportunity. 
But let's not get sidetracked in the process. If you're lucky enough to elicit 
admiration from the opposite sex but find this admiration unwelcome, well, 
you've got a tongue! If things get physical, there already are laws to protect 
you. And lest I be justly accused of chauvinism, let me add that you buff guys 
who silently suffer the unladylike stares and comments of female escrow loan 
officers and financial planners have recourse even if Sen. Tom Hayden's bill 
escapes Wilson's pen, as do those undergoing same-sex "harassment." Lets all 
treat each other with respect and common sense and cease this legal 
demonization of those whose chromosomes may be a little different from our own.

O.C. THEATER REVIEW; IT'S A PROPERLY PROPER 'STORY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Style is everything in a revival of a Philip Barry play. His era was that of 
black tie at dinner, a champagne glass in every hand and a firm denial that the 
Great Depression was going on outside the theater. It also was the period of 
stylish acting, and light comedy that floated like a summer zephyr across the 
footlights. 
</P>
<P>
 As directed by Gary Krinke at the Vanguard Theatre, Barry's "Philadelphia 
Story" is stylish as stylish can be. Krinke has brought out Barry's gossamer 
sense of humor, and has imbued the play's cast with an old-line-money aura of 
ease and complacency, even when a possible scandal might turn the Lord 
household upside down and absolutely ruin daughter Tracy's imminent wedding. 
These Lords seem to breathe the same air that the characters breathed when they 
were created almost 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Placing the action in the Vanguard's postage stamp-sized space makes the play 
seem even bigger than it is. Krinke's choreography of the prenuptial busy-ness 
at the Lord estate is intricate and true to place, period and genre, and his 
stage pictures, under Terry Gunkel's gentle and evocative lighting design, are 
classy. 
</P>
<P>
 The director's success is especially evident in his actors. It is particularly 
important to have a proper Tracy, the impetuous daughter who is approaching her 
second marriage with less than total enthusiasm -- especially after the arrival 
of Mike Connor, a writer assigned to get an inside story on the high jinks of 
the rich (and of Tracy's first husband, the dashing, glib, charming C.K. Dexter 
Haven). Debbie Grattan is a bubbling, impish whirlwind of a Tracy, snappy yet 
vulnerable in a sparkling gem of a performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perfectly matched is Robert Shaun Kilburn's masterfully manic Dexter, subtle 
in detail and charm, a playboy to the core with a warmth and affection Tracy 
can't resist. Damian Papahronis' contained, thoughtful Connor has just the 
right weight to attract Tracy's intellectual curiosity, along with a gentle 
humor to set her at her ease during a drunken late-night romantic peccadillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Joni Higginbotham is bright and delectably funny as Tracy's giddily conniving 
younger sister, and Joyce Eriksen and Stuart Eriksen are excellent as the 
upper-crust parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Masters is super as Tracy's brother Sandy, full of charm and high spirits 
as he puts all the speed bumps in the family's path and then removes them just 
in time. He looks (despite an anachronistic haircut) and acts very much like a 
rich kid honestly trying to make his way in the workaday world. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Godfrey's Liz Imbrie, the photographer who accompanies Connor, is 
gracious and witty; Michael John McKay, as the man Tracy doesn't really want to 
marry, is a perfectly and properly attractive cluck, and Bob Sessions is funny 
as Tracy's tippling Uncle Willy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lynda Blais' costumes are (except for Connor's modern striped tux jacket) just 
right for the time, and Michael Keith Allen's settings easily turn the small 
space into the Lords' expansive drawing room and summer gazebo.

 MTV Surprise? So who's likely to generate the most attention at Thursday's 
1994 MTV Video Music Awards? Sources say it won't be host Roseanne or even the 
first-rate slate of performers, which includes the likes of Bruce Springsteen, 
the Rolling Stones and Aerosmith. Expected on the show, in their first onstage 
appearance together, are none other than Michael Jackson and his new bride, 
Lisa Marie Presley. Look for the duo early on in the show, in a role similar to 
a then-embattled Pee Wee Herman's surprise appearance in which he opened the 
program a couple of years ago. The show airs on cable's MTV Thursday night at 
8.

THEATER REVIEWS; 'HATFUL OF RAIN' KEEPS ITS SHAPE; 1955 DRAMA STILL PULLS 
AUDIENCE IN WITH ITS LOOK AT DRUG ADDICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Junkie" was a scary label in the '50s, when "A Hatful of Rain" premiered in 
New York City. Just the mention of the word, usually in a whisper, was enough 
to evoke demons, danger, shame and loathing. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Hatful," when Johnny says the word in a writhing confession, it's supposed 
to rip the lid off a problem that has been ignored for years -- which indeed 
was the effect in 1955 when this was one of the first dramas to explore drug 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, we may not be more tolerant but we are more desensitized; as a 
nation, we still don't like dope but its familiarity has left many of us blase. 
To a modern audience, Michael V. Gazzo's play can seem dated, a throwback. But 
that doesn't stop the Ensemble Theatre's revival from drawing us in. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Roosevelt Blankenship Jr. has decided against updating the story of 
Johnny, a war hero who becomes hooked and threatens his family's stability. 
There is no contemporary street garb, no talk of crackheads. 
</P>
<P>
 By sticking with the '50s feel, he has given us a period piece; he and his 
cast are offering the type of melodrama (i.e. often overheated) that marked 
much of the consciousness-raising theater of its time. This staging is likewise 
fidgety, hyperbolic and quaint, but it also is appealingly vivid. 
</P>
<P>
 We first meet Johnny as he is having dinner with his wife, Celia, and his 
father. There is tension around the table, which tells us something about the 
uneasy relationships shared there, especially between father and son. As it 
becomes clear that Johnny is an addict, the struggles intensify. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only person who knows about Johnny is Polo, his younger brother. Before 
the play ends, everybody finds out: It's difficult keeping this sort of thing 
quiet, especially when your pusher shows up, ready to kill you over the money 
you owe. And that's just part of Johnny's problem: He needs a fix, and the cops 
have shut down the local drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching Johnny descend is disturbing, mainly because David Boreanaz is so 
adept at conveying the character's desperation. While hardly an understated 
performance -- Boreanaz twitches and shakes like all the junkies we've ever 
seen in the movies -- it is an affecting one. Boreanaz seems in genuine pain. 
</P>
<P>
 There are solid supporting performances. Paul Barbosa projects the goodness in 
Polo and Wisconsin Sturm reveals Celia's confusion and love. There is substance 
to these characterizations. But Paul Connelly doesn't show much more than anger 
as Johnny's father. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Darne, Arturo M. Ransom and James Manley Green are edgy and frightening 
as the thugs who come to collect Johnny's debts and Autumn Hafenfeld makes a 
brief but amusing appearance as a stoned socialite slumming in Johnny's 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ensemble Theatre, a tiny playhouse obviously working on a small budget, 
also scores with the set, which Blankenship designed. Johnny's tenement 
apartment is sad and worn, much like the people who live there.

THEATER REVIEWS; 'CHORUS LINE' GETS A KICK FROM ACTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "A Chorus Line" has its small charms, in spite of a pretty dull score (music 
by Marvin Hamlisch) and not much plot or suspense. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Michael Bennett, who conceived it, taped dancers telling their 
stories of struggle, and the tapes became the basis of the show. They're pretty 
ordinary tales, of the sort glorified as long ago as "Stage Door" and "A Star 
Is Born." When the show works, it usually works because of its energy and 
through the strengths of individual performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The production at the La Habra Depot Theatre comes to life when the company 
dances Nicki Peek's energetic choreography. Even though Brad A. Steward's 
musical direction doesn't sparkle, the cast members enjoy themselves and their 
sense of fun overflows into the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 With some exceptions, the dialogue sections tend to drag under Larry Watts' 
direction, although some of the very large cast stands out. Rick Watson is very 
capable as the auditioning choreographer, Zach. Denise Hadland's over-the-hill 
Sheila, Bill Walters' small-town boy Mark, and Ryan Black's upper-crust snot 
Bobby also give the show a shot in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Alison Boole has the pivotal role of Cassie, the ex-chorus girl who got a few 
breaks but now has to start over. She is fine in the dialogue sections with her 
ex-lover Zach. But she is not the dancer Cassie is supposed to be, nor does she 
have the aura that would get her grabbed out of a chorus for a featured role. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, Nicki Peek's Val is a firecracker during "Dance: Ten; Looks: 
Three." In the show's most persuasive number, "What I Did for Love," the 
powerful and riveting Adrianna Sanchez wrenches the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 But the potentially most touching segment -- when Paul (Ruben Rodriguez) tells 
of his teen years as a drag queen and of the startling moment when his parents 
found out -- is, in spite of Rodriguez' efforts, mostly lost as a result of the 
staging, which has him almost whispering the story to nearby Zach.

 With the longest single engagement in the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center's eight-year history, "The Phantom of the Opera" grossed a record $7.3 
million, playing to 149,354 during the six weeks from July 22 through 
Saturday.A center official said Tuesday that paid attendance averaged 97.3% of 
capacity for the 54 performances (the potential gross was $7.45 million). In 
its final week, "Phantom" set a one-week record of $1.1 million with paid 
attendance of 99.9%. The previous record-holder was "Les Miserables," which 
grossed $954,779 during one week in September 1992.

'MEDITATIONS' GOES BEYOND RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A wag once said that in our time if you want to be famous, the best thing to 
be is a rock star, but if you want to be a failure the best thing to be is an 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this century the artistic impulse is not always the same thing as a lusting 
after fame. On the contrary, the calling is often a way of fulfilling a 
creative urge while remaining largely anonymous. Artists of this stamp come 
second only to poets in obdurate determination to do their thing while 
protecting their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is made by "Three Meditations" at the Armory Center for the Arts in 
Pasadena. It consists of installations by a trio of artists each more 
interested in contemplation than recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Harden held his first solo show in 1967 at La Cienega's lovably 
rear-guard Ceeje Gallery. It produced a larger crop of honorably obscure 
artists than any interesting gallery before or since. About the only one to 
float more-or-less accidentally to larger recognition was Charles Garabedian.  
</P>
<P>
 Harden, from the beginning, made work so introspective it could barely be 
seen. He painted or drew very small cows or horses on relatively large formats. 
About the only embellishment he allowed himself were poetic, slightly wistful 
titles. In the ensuing decades he confined himself to studios in rural 
locations, declined to define his art in written statements and never made an 
issue of the fact he is an African American. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only changes in his work consisted of its growing ever smaller; 
witness the prints and paintings on view. None is larger than about 3-by-7 
inches. All depict a single bird nearly invisible against its background. All 
paintings are titled with the same brief verse: 
</P>
<P>
 songs sung 
</P>
<P>
 (with grace) 
</P>
<P>
 of an inward place, 
</P>
<P>
 in a stillness, sweet, 
</P>
<P>
 in morning, mourning 
</P>
<P>
 in evening, even. 
</P>
<P>
 He has made his pictures more sumptuous over time. Each frame is marbled gold. 
Mats are a close match to his images, often rendered in lush texture with 
metallic pigment. Clearly, however, the intent of all this is to create an 
atmosphere rather than an impression. Images seem to exist as objects hovering 
on the brink of disembodiment. They are like the first rays of dawn or the last 
of dusk. 
</P>
<P>
 MacRae Wylde is almost literally unknown. Just 30, he's held only four 
exhibitions in venues each more modest than the last. He's hiked around from 
the Central American rain forest to the natural American outback on both 
coasts. He collects earth and rock that he grinds into painting pigment. 
</P>
<P>
 His installation is called "Four Places." Each wall of a small pavilion in 
mid-gallery bears a number of thick, nearly square paintings, groups of which 
are in one solid earth hue -- siennas, ochres and grays. Evidently grouped 
according to the source of the pigment materials, the work brings to mind 
severely minimal artists from Malevich to Judd but it doesn't matter much. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything is unimportant here, it is the usual citing of influences evident 
in the artists' work. To whatever extent this group has paid attention to other 
artists, it has only been with a view to translating other ideas into their 
private languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Wylde's most interesting piece is "Slocum River." Two of its large gray 
compositions cantilever vertically from the wall on their edges, becoming 
virtually architectural. The artist seems to muse on the primal moment when 
humans began to apply rational process to the primal ooze. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wylde is intuitively involved in philosophy, the remaining meditator 
reaches to cosmology. 
</P>
<P>
 She goes by the pseudonym "Madame X," upping the obscurity ante. She explores 
"Eternal Culture" in various mandala drawings bearing the usual diagrammatic 
vortexes, whorls and cryptic writing. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is nothing scholarly or archeological here. Madame X goes about this 
like autobiography. "In the year 0000 Madame X journeyed into the sphere of 
eternal history, becoming the first to observe its eternal order," she writes 
in one mandala. 
</P>
<P>
 One wall displays a group of "Little Spirits" -- sculpture that look like an 
abstract distillation of votive folk carving. An inner sanctum nook encloses a 
"Model of Time" that is a beautifully formed hinged wooden cone covered with 
decorative glyphs and containing a double spinning top. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a whiff of camp about both Mme. X's persona and her work, but where is 
it written an occult seer can't have a sense of humor? 
</P>
<P>
 Her art harks back the adventurous spirit of the late '50s, the art of Wallace 
Berman and George Herms and the films of Kenneth Anger. It's both apt and 
bracing to find this happening in a coercively conformist decade that makes the 
Eisenhower years look like a bacchanal.

TV REVIEW; A HOPEFUL 'HIGH SCHOOL II' VALUES CRITICAL THINKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frederick Wiseman makes films in which patterns and meanings gradually emerge. 
But a pattern is also emerging in Wiseman's career, and his latest work, "High 
School II," confirms it. 
</P>
<P>
 The early Wiseman films, while seemingly removed from their subjects, were 
considerable social critiques of institutions, from mental hospitals and the 
welfare system to the meat industry -- and public schools, which came off 
rather badly in Wiseman's 1968 "High School," about Philadelphia's Northeast 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wiseman grows older, he seems to grow more hopeful. His recent "Near 
Death," "Central Park" and "Zoo" showed mostly good people doing good work 
(yes, even in zoos). "High School II" documents success in an East Harlem 
public school, Central Park East Secondary, where drug use is as rare as 
dropouts and where 67% of the graduates attend private colleges. The old rules 
that dominated in the first "High School" -- silent classes dominated by a 
yammering teacher, bureaucratic mini-dictators, few visible parents, rampant 
boredom -- are tossed out in the new "High School." 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast immediately hits you. Students confer with teachers in one-on-one 
discussions, co-principals Paul Schwartz and Deborah Meier appear to be 
constantly available for individual meetings with students and their families, 
and intellectual rigor in a lab-like atmosphere is so dominant that it's like 
breathing. Only at the end of the nearly 4-hour film does Meier sum up what 
we've been watching: A pedagogy that blends kindergarten's sense of active play 
with the Oxford-Cambridge tradition of a student setting his or her academic 
course with a tutor. 
</P>
<P>
 For a good stretch of "High School II," all we know is that we're not in the 
typical public school anymore. The school's full name and neighborhood are 
never mentioned, and its academic program of doctoral-style papers in lieu of 
standard tests is never articulated. Wiseman's adherence to a cine ma ve rite 
that resists factoids doesn't help him here. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, though, cleverly plays on viewer presumptions of both what a public 
school looks and sounds like, and what a school with predominantly minorities 
should be. Where are the rigid audiences of students impassively staring at a 
lecturing teacher? Where are the drugs, the guns, the gangs? 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere, out on the street, but not in here. Here, Central Park East kids 
sit in small groups, puzzling through engineering or math or literary problems, 
prodded by friendly but very serious teachers -- and deeply concerned parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The guiding ethic at Central Park East is what Schwartz and Meier call five 
"habits of mind": Show evidence, analyze whose point of view is being 
expressed, examine alternative solutions, show how ideas are connected to each 
other and prove their relevancy. But the umbrella value above this school's 
"habits" is that endangered species, critical thinking. Wiseman has found it 
alive and well and living in East Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
 * "High School II" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and at noon 
Saturday on KPBS-TV Channel 15.

 BUS RIDERS: Cars dominate the culture, but Los Angeles and the Valley have 
their share of daily bus riders -- 1.2 million, to be exact. Most passengers 
don't earn much, don't own a car, belong to a minority group -- and are more 
than 30 years old (above). . . . Still, if the MTA has its way, fares will go 
up by 25 cents. A federal judge may rule next week whether hike would penalize 
low-income riders (B5). 
</P>
<P>
 SMALLER FAIR: Randy Travis and Clint Black drew a crowd, and wrestling was a 
big hit. But unofficial total attendance at the Antelope Valley Fair, which 
ended Monday, dropped to 231,610 from last year's 243,201, spokeswoman Denise 
Fisher said. . . . She blamed it on the hot weather, sub-par economy and two 
concert showings. "Hank Williams Jr. and the Smothers Brothers didn't do well," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 SAVE THE POOL: Goodby summer. Hello Santa Claus. That's the story of the West 
Valley Family YMCA swimming pool in Reseda. Damaged by the quake, it barely 
survived the popular summer season with broken pipes and problems in its filter 
system. . . . Then came Taco Bell to the rescue. The company, which set up 
quake collections at restaurants nationwide, has donated $40,850 that will be 
used to make repairs when the pool closes in December. 
</P>
<P>
 TOURISM: There is good news and bad news about the tourism business in 
Southern California (D1). Despite the quake, people still came to see the 
sights, including the Valley's Universal Studios. . . . But most came from a 
short distance away; there was a big drop in out-of-state and international 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 ON A MISSION: The Mission League is moving up in the world, from Division IV 
to Division III, and that's a pretty big step for any prep football program. 
"It will be tougher," Chaminade Coach Rich Lawson said. "We used to play easier 
teams in the playoffs." . . . In another preview of the new high school season, 
Valley Sports (C15) takes a look at what the new alignment means. Who Rides 
MTA?

 BACK IN GEAR: So what if the new countywide VISTA bus service is off to a slow 
start (B4)? The beach bus is back. . . . Four months after Oxnard officials 
voted to eliminate bus service to area beaches, VISTA has resurrected the bus 
route. . . . "There were a lot of people out there who simply could not get 
around without bus service," said Mary Travis, spokeswoman for the Ventura 
County Transportation Commission. "We are getting a lot of positive response." 
</P>
<P>
 LOTTO FEVER: James and Roberta Stevens of Newbury Park marched into a 
management meeting Tuesday and quit their jobs (A1). Who needs work when you've 
just hit the $33.7-million SuperLotto jackpot? . . . The couple retired early 
from Litton Industries in Woodland Hills after winning the Lottery bonanza. 
They will receive $1.2 million a year, after taxes, for the next 20 years. . . 
. By Tuesday, the couple had bought a new car and were looking into a larger 
motor home. "We're going to enjoy life and help our children," James Stevens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 SCHOOL DAYS: Speaking of the Lottery, remember the old slogan: "Our schools 
win too." Lottery revenue funneled to public education apparently doesn't go 
far. . . . Take Tierra Linda School in Camarillo, one of several Ventura County 
schools that opened for business Tuesday (B1). The new school has posted a wish 
list for supplies and equipment. . . . "We get some," Principal Dianne 
Quinby-Anders said of Lottery revenue, "but at the same time, the state is 
giving us less money." 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE JOB: It has been 26 years since the Rev. Luther McCurtis founded a 
small but ambitious no-fee employment service in Ventura. This week, the 
62-year-old pastor will be honored for putting the unemployed to work. . . . 
McCurtis' Employment Aptitude & Placement Assn. was born out of a simple 
philosophy: "My thought was that food and clothing was just a Band-Aid," 
McCurtis said. "I thought that the permanent cure to poverty was a permanent 
job and a paycheck."

DANA PARSONS : TO BUILD A NEW COUNTY HERITAGE, IT'S RIGHT IN THE BALLPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have seen the future, and it's 347 feet down the left-field line, 350 to 
right and 415 to straightaway center. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a view of the downtown skyline from the concourse behind home plate and 
of the Rocky Mountains over the outfield wall. 
</P>
<P>
 It's 2,100 seats in the "Rockpile" that will go on sale every day for a dollar 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking about Coors Field, the new baseball park in Denver, but if you 
think it's irrelevant to Orange County, you just whiffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rest assured that Angel executives are well aware of Coors Field. They're also 
painfully aware their Angels play in the midst of an affluent metropolis of 2.4 
million people, with perfect weather every day, and yet can't get 25,000 people 
to a ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Denver people are saying straight-faced that they expect Coors 
Field, which will seat 50,000, to be sold out every game for at least the first 
two years of its existence. Those are the kind of numbers baseball executives 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 So, yes, the Angels know all about Coors Field. That's why they want one of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gleason is a former aide to presidential candidate Gary Hart, but now is 
deputy director of something called the Denver Metropolitan Major League 
Stadium Baseball District. While I vacationed in Denver the last couple weeks, 
Gleason gave me a tour of the still-under-construction ballpark in lower 
downtown Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the current strike doesn't kill baseball forever, Denver played into 
the wave of baseball nostalgia with its new park. From the outside, it reminds 
people of old Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Inside, foul territory will be small, 
giving spectators a feeling of being on top of the action. And, with only 4,600 
available public parking spots on the site, people will be encouraged to take 
public transportation and walk to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, going to the ballgame will be an experience that going to Anaheim 
Stadium isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "This location and design have some magic together," Gleason said. "It's like 
the old-time ballparks that were shoe-horned into existing neighborhoods. It's 
a ballpark that looks like it could have been there for a hundred years. If you 
put this same thing in the vast expanses of the south part of the (Denver) 
metro area, you wouldn't have the same reaction. It's probably an emotional 
thing as much as anything. I wouldn't say it's the same as building a 
basketball arena or hockey arena or even a football stadium. There's a trend 
toward nostalgia in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Gleason acknowledged that some "financial consulting" people from Orange 
County have talked to him "within the last month or two" about the financing 
for Coors Field. He would only say the consultants weren't representing either 
the Angels or the city of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Coors Field is everything Anaheim Stadium is not. The question is, can 
Orange County build a new ballpark that will capture fans' interest? 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Santee is a senior vice president of HOK Sports in Kansas City, the 
architectural firm that designed Coors Field, as well as new ballparks in 
Baltimore, Chicago and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot to learn on those projects," he said by telephone from company 
offices Tuesday, "but what we essentially learned was that places like Ebbets 
Field and Shibe Park (in Philadelphia) became symbols and icons for baseball in 
their communities. Through our working with the Orioles and White Sox and 
Indians and Rockies, we found that each of them were in search of something 
like that, a symbol of the team and city and community that they could package 
in such a fashion to cause them to believe it was theirs, that they owned it." 
</P>
<P>
 That would seem to be the $64,000 question for Orange County. We joke about 
the lack of heritage in newly emerging metropolises like Orange County, but 
it's no laughing matter when it potentially factors in to the success of a 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Orange County, Santee talked in generalities about "controlling your 
own destiny." He said his company tries "to create districts where, once you've 
arrived within six to eight blocks, you're in the ballpark district. That might 
mean you do something different in Southern California that represents that, 
and it doesn't mean you have to have a red-brick building, but the image and 
identity make it clear that you've arrived at the site." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm in the camp that's convinced an intimate new ballpark in Orange County 
would be a smashing success, even with the crummy team the Angels have been 
fielding. A baseball park should include aesthetic pleasures (See: Dodger 
Stadium) that a football stadium doesn't have to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 So, yes, let's build the Angels a new park. Let's give it Orange County's own 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
 Which leads to that perplexing first hurdle: 
</P>
<P>
 Um, exactly what does our signature look like? 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: EL TORO TOO VITAL, EXPENSIVE TO CLOSE; GLOBAL HOT SPOTS, 
NEW MEMBERS OF BASE-CLOSURE PANEL, HIGH COSTS OF MOVING CAN STILL AFFECT 
FACILITY'S FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GIL FERGUSON, Gil Ferguson is a Republican state assemblyman from Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pitched battle is underway over the future of the El Toro Marine base as we 
near a vote in November on the airport initiative. "New" options and players 
have entered the fray. While nobody pretends to know what the future portends, 
all the competing factions do appear convinced about one thing: shutting down 
El Toro is a "done deal." But is it? 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances, at least for now, seem to indicate as much. After all, El 
Toro is included on the official list prepared by the federal Base Closure 
Commission and is slated to close by the year 2000. And, even Congress and the 
President can't delete a base on the list without starting all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 As compelling as all this sounds, there's more to it than that -- much more. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Congress will appoint a new, 1995 Base Closure and Realignment 
Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 The new commission can, at the urging of the secretary of defense, remove any 
base from the current list due to strategic need, or whose shutdown and 
relocation costs would exceed any long-term saving from closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Navy has recently written to the commanders of the Marine bases on 
the list, offering them the opportunity to request reconsideration, based on 
those strategic and cost terms. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the State Base Closure Task Force, I have written to the 
secretary of defense. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never believed that El Toro should be shut down. It's simply too vital 
to our national security and too expensive to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not advocating or opposing a regional airport, commercialization or 
"joint use" of the base.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the possibility that El Toro may be closed has created a dramatic 
economic opportunity.  
</P>
<P>
 But our foremost concern should be America's fundamental security.  
</P>
<P>
 And this is what I believe was not addressed adequately by the last federal 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything I've experienced and know -- after having served in World War II, 
Korea and Vietnam, and observing the permanent reality of international 
conflict and threats to our security -- tell me it would be a tragic mistake to 
abandon El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't a question of "accepting" that the Cold War is over; it is! We 
clearly don't need all the military installations we now have.  
</P>
<P>
 But we must maintain those that are strategically important to accommodate our 
restructured military. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not our military is downsized to the extent sought by Bill Clinton 
and the Democratic leaders in Congress, the fact is that America has determined 
we will never again need large land armies.  
</P>
<P>
 We will fight future conflicts with small, balanced rapid deployment forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Bases that are no longer needed for this new national defense strategy should 
be shut down, in order to reduce federal spending. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no doubt that many of the units and squadrons based at El Toro could 
be relocated most anywhere in the United States without any strategic loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Transferring those troops and aircraft might well free up a significant 
portion of the base for commercialization, or to accommodate an airport if 
voters so decide. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one special function that can only be performed there or 
someplace nearby, and that is to provide the means to launch our infantry/tank 
teams at Camp Pendleton and our artillery/rocket forces at Twentynine Palms. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro has proven its strategic location, time and again: from the Cuban 
missile crisis, through Vietnam and to the Persian Gulf and the other hot spots 
that continue to emerge around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Then too there are the cost considerations. According to the Marine Corps, it 
would cost $1.6 billion to close El Toro, 30 times the annual cost to keep it 
open. That doesn't even include the huge outlay needed to relocate and house 
4,600 military families at San Diego's Miramar base, as currently planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramar has virtually no housing for enlisted personnel, the lowest paid. 
These men and women, and their families, could be forced onto the expensive 
civilian economy.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, they have been overlooked in the government's attempt to "cut costs." 
</P>
<P>
 This could be one more unconscionable byproduct of a shortsighted decision 
that gambles away our nation's defense while providing little or no effective 
relief to the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there is still the possibility that the basic strategic function 
served by El Toro will remain there or be met in equal terms elsewhere, nearby. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans group leaders all over California, who share this concern as well as 
the concern for taxpayers and our enlisted personnel, are joining in pressing 
the secretary of defense and our congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 It's imperative that each of these concerns be revisited and squarely 
addressed by the new commission.

SAMPRAS SLAMS INTO THE WALL IN 5-SET NEW YORK MARATHON; TENNIS: THE TOP-RANKED 
PLAYER GIVES HIS ALL IN A SHOCKING LOSS TO NO. 23 JAIME YZAGA OF PERU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a real-life drama, played out not far off Broadway, the unsinkable Pete 
Sampras sagged and sank here Tuesday in the U.S. Open tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an upset of epic proportions, an 8.0 on the Richter scale of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded-and-ranked Sampras, winner of four of the last five Grand Slam 
events and 35 of his last 36 Grand Slam matches, lost to the 23rd-ranked Jaime 
Yzaga of Peru. The five-set match, won by the 26-year-old Yzaga in 3 hours 38 
minutes, ended with Yzaga stepping up and cracking Sampras' high-kicking 
94-m.p.h. first serve with a backhand that zipped cross court and cleanly past 
a charging Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that, the 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 struggle was over. A 
tournament that had appeared to be all ecstasy for Sampras had turned into 
nearly four hours of agony on the Stadium court. He had given all he had, had 
carried on through the last four games purely on the energy flowing from the 
crowd of 20,000. And Yzaga had had more. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sampras: "I just hit the wall today." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Yzaga: "I congratulate him because he never really gave up, and 
obviously, he wasn't feeling well. But that's what makes a champion. He kept 
fighting until the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Although three years younger than Yzaga, Sampras was nowhere near as fit. 
Until the start of this tournament, he hadn't played a competitive match since 
the Davis Cup on July 17. He rested a left ankle that had developed calcium 
deposits, and his run through the early rounds of the U.S. Open had been, as it 
turns out, misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just not in great shape now," he said. "And I acknowledge the fact that 
I've taken five weeks off and not really played many matches. At the end, I 
just didn't have anything left." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, about the only thing that didn't break down on Sampras' body was 
the notorious left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got blisters on my feet -- my feet are raw," he said. "Everything is just 
sore. My whole body." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he could have played had he somehow gotten past Yzaga, he nodded, 
then added, "With a day off, and with rest, and maybe 20 hours of massages." 
</P>
<P>
 The drama that played out was high theater. Once Sampras failed to knock Yzaga 
out in a fourth-set tiebreaker, he was in deep trouble. But like a game boxer, 
he kept getting off his stool and coming out for the next round, only to return 
more bloodied than before. 
</P>
<P>
 With the late afternoon shadows creeping longer over the court, Yzaga got up a 
service break in the fifth and ran that out to a 5-2 lead. Sampras, looking 
like a winded NBA player along the lane during free throws, kept bending over, 
hands on knees, stealing every moment between points for every breath of air he 
could find. Continuing to play had to be agony. Watching it certainly was. 
</P>
<P>
 But somehow, with the wildly nationalistic American crowd frantically urging 
him on, Sampras reached back and held at 3-5, then battled Yzaga from the 
baseline until the Peruvian clay-court specialist finally missed a forehand 
inches long for break-back and 4-5. Sampras held for 5-5, then Yzaga held to 
send Sampras back out to serve at 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
 With the match-time clock moving toward 3 3/4 hours, and with the stadium 
atmosphere resembling a Davis Cup match in Paraguay, Sampras sent a running 
cross-court forehand wide and Yzaga had match point. Sampras sent his big 
kicker at Yzaga's backhand, and Yzaga answered with the shot heard 'round the 
tennis world. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got one of the better backhands on the tour," Sampras said. "I just felt 
I needed to come in, hit a three-quarter speed serve and put the pressure on 
him. But he came up with a good shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras left the court quickly, managing a feeble wave as he was escorted by 
trainers and medical people. And after much speculation about stomach ailments 
and food poisoning, two doctors met with the press, followed closely by 
Sampras. The diagnosis from all was simple, and very un-medical sounding: Pete 
Sampras was dead tired. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras said, "I can look back on this year and say that once you win a Grand 
Slam, it's a good year; if you win two, it's a great year. But I'm so 
disappointed, being out the whole summer and not preparing well, and all that 
just kind of halted a good year I'll get over this, I mean, I wanted to come 
down and talk to you guys and tell you guys how I'm feeling. That's important 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras also said he hadn't decided whether he will play Davis Cup later this 
month against Sweden, and that, at this point, the U.S. Open looks like Andre 
Agassi's show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's got a really good shot," Sampras said. "The way he's playing, I 
think he's got as good a chance as anybody." U.S. Open Notes 
</P>

 No. 4 Michael Stich of Germany completed the quarterfinal field, emerging as 
the top remaining seeded player in the field when he beat No. 14 Yevgeny

Sweden, with the rest of the men's quarterfinals pitting Yzaga against Karel

</P>
<P>
 On the women's side, second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain gained a 
semifinal berth by easily handling No. 5 Kimiko Date of Japan, 6-3, 6-0. She 
will play No. 8 Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, who ousted the last remaining 
American woman, unseeded Gigi Fernandez, 6-2, 7-5. . . . Today's quarterfinals 
match No. 1 Steffi Graf of Germany against No. 11 Amanda Coetzer of South

<TEXT>
<P>
 Center Pat LaFontaine of the Buffalo Sabres, the NHL's No. 2 scorer two 
seasons ago but injured most of last season, has agreed to a contract that will 
reportedly make him one of the highest-paid players in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Vice President Gerry Meehan said the Sabres have agreed in principle 
with LaFontaine on a contract extension, but the team is trying to insure the 
deal in case he is hurt again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo News reported that the Sabres will pay LaFontaine $22.5 million 
over five years, making him the fourth highest-paid player in the league behind 
only Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux and Eric Lindros.

 Cam Neely, one of the NHL's top goal-scorers despite a succession of serious 
injuries, ended his holdout by agreeing to a one-year contract with the Boston 
Bruins. . . . Mark Osborne, who played for the New York Rangers for 3 1/2 
seasons in the mid-1980s, has re-signed with the Stanley Cup champions as an 
unrestricted free agent. Osborne, 33, played for the Toronto Maple Leafs last 
season. . . . Defenseman Yan Golubovsky, the Detroit Red Wings' top draft pick 
in the June NHL draft, signed a multiyear contract. Jurisprudence

 Former Pro Bowl guard Carlton Haselrig of the Pittsburgh Steelers was located 
in a budget motel in suburban Pittsburgh as police acted on a missing person's 
report filed by his wife. 
</P>

 Haselrig appeared to be in good health and good spirits and agreed to meet 
with his wife after he was discovered, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempe, Ariz., police are planning to interview boxer Michael Carbajal about 
his alleged involvement in weekend gunfire, but were downplaying speculation 
that he's a gang member. Police said the interview was delayed because 
Carbajal, a former WBC and IBF flyweight champion, didn't have a criminal 
attorney. Miscellany

 Bill Walsh, Stanford's football coach, is optimistic about his team this 
season, saying that the Cardinal may have the best talent since the John 
Ralston era in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot depends on the conference," Walsh told Glenn Dickey of the San 
Francisco Chronicle. "If there is a great team out there, well, we can't 
compete with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if the standard is UCLA, a team we probably should have beaten last year, 
well, we can compete with them."

<P>
 Q: Are left-handed batsmen inherently elegant or is it merely an illusion 
prompted by their relative exoticism? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A right-arm-over-the-wicket bowler is likely to leave the southpaw more 
room outside the off-stump to play off and cover drives. If he straightens his 
line a little, he is apt to find the ball whistling past midwicket.

WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY; IOC TAKES STRAIGHT AND ARROW IN EASTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the wall outside U.S. Olympic Committee Executive Director Harvey 
Schiller's office in Colorado Springs, Colo., is a display of arrows donated by 
Jim Easton, president of archery's international federation. 
</P>
<P>
 When Easton was elected Monday in Paris as one of two International Olympic 
Committee members from the United States, it must have felt to Schiller as if 
one of those arrows had pierced his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Several candidates had been mentioned for the position since Robert Helmick 
resigned in 1991, but no one pursued it as aggressively as Schiller. 
</P>
<P>
 The IOC is often suspicious of those with so much ambition, wondering whether 
they are more interested in promoting themselves than the Olympic movement. As 
one member said, when a campaign is perceived as one, it is doomed to failure. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if there is no reason to suspect that Schiller's motives were 
anything but the purest, he was never considered a serious candidate because of 
his philosophical and personal differences with the senior member of the IOC 
from the United States, Anita DeFrantz. 
</P>
<P>
 DeFrantz has been an IOC member for eight years and gained admission into the 
inner circle, the executive board, two years ago. If she was not comfortable 
with Schiller as a potential member, then neither was IOC President Juan 
Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller underestimated DeFrantz's influence. Even though she, as an IOC 
member, sits on the USOC's executive committee, she sometimes is treated as an 
outsider there. Now that Schiller is leaving on Oct. 1 to become president of 
TBS Sports, perhaps there will be an improvement in the relationship between 
the USOC and DeFrantz. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is little question that DeFrantz can work with Easton. Both are from Los 
Angeles, both were officials with the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee 
and both are actively involved in the Amateur Athletic Foundation, DeFrantz as 
president and Easton as a member of the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Easton's election also helps fulfill Samaranch's goal of giving international 
sports federations more representation within the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
 But Samaranch is relaxing on his promise to do the same for women. All of the 
12 new members named Monday are men. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the IOC's evaluation commission were asked to name its final four 
candidates for the 2002 Winter Olympics today instead of next January, insiders 
say that the survivors would be Salt Lake City, Oestersund, Sweden; Sion, 
Switzerland, and Graz, Austria. And if the final vote by the IOC were today 
instead of next June, they say that the clear winner would be Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 So, naturally, the most nervous of the nine bid committees formally presenting 
their candidacies before the start of last week's IOC Congress in Paris was the 
one from Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of that city's committee are aware that at least three considerations 
-- their second-place finish to Nagano, Japan, by only three votes in the 
bidding for 1998; their firm financial position and, with the recent start of 
construction on a bobsled and luge track and a speedskating oval, their 
November, 1995, target date for completion of all venues -- have placed them in 
an unenviable position as the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 The IOC tends to get bored with favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salt Lake City also could be vulnerable if Quebec City, Canada, is among the 
four cities selected to appear before the IOC voters on June 16 in Budapest, 
Hungary.  
</P>
<P>
 Although many IOC members concede that Salt Lake City's bid for 1998 was 
technically better than Nagano's, they were reluctant to vote for another U.S. 
city so soon after awarding the 1996 Summer Olympics to Atlanta. They could 
decide in Budapest that 2002 would be a good time to return the Winter Games to 
North America -- as long as it is not to a U.S. city. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec City supporters already are aiming at Salt Lake City. Richard Pound, an 
IOC executive board member from Montreal, said last week that the Canadian 
Olympic Assn. did not designate Calgary as its official candidate because the 
world is not ready for another Winter Olympics in the Rocky Mountains so soon 
after the 1988 Games in that city. Salt Lake City, of course, is also located 
amid the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Pound was merely retaliating for recent remarks by the U.S. Olympic 
Committee's interim executive director, John Krimsky, who said that Quebec City 
underestimated costs in announcing a proposed operating budget of $540 million. 
That is $260 million less than Salt Lake City's forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canada made that mistake in 1976 in Montreal," Krimsky said, referring to the 
gigantic deficit left behind by the Summer Olympics. "The Olympic movement in 
North America and the world cannot afford another city to make that kind of 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why does any city want to stage the Winter Olympics? 
</P>
<P>
 Lillehammer, Norway, which took on that responsibility in February, reaped a 
$58-million surplus, 500 new jobs and such favorable publicity worldwide that 
it broke all of its tourism records this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano officials thought they had gone above and beyond the call of duty by 
agreeing to accept curling and women's ice hockey in their program, but 
Samaranch surprised them by asking if they believed snowboarding might be 
another valuable addition. They told him that they have never given the sport 
much thought but promised that they will now.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rocket Ismail-to-tailback campaign continues. . . . I'm not advocating a 
heavy work load for a 180-pounder who might not be durable. . . . Just give the 
ball to the Rocket a dozen times a game and watch the Raider rushing attack 
take off. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it can't get any worse. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' leading rusher against San Francisco on Monday night was fullback 
Tom Rathman with 12 yards. Tailbacks Ty Montgomery and Harvey Williams combined 
for 12. The net was 34 yards in 20 carries for a 1.7 average. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ismail, who rushed four times for the Raiders last year, would be the 
equivalent of a rookie running back. But that's the position where rookies make 
the biggest impact. Look at Marshall Faulk. Last year, it was Jerome Bettis. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Raiders' other problems Monday night probably can be corrected 
without personnel changes, although linebacker might remain a weakness. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Not having to face Jerry Rice again during the regular season will be a plus. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to ABC for showing the replay of Napoleon McCallum's ugly knee 
injury only twice. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Before guaranteeing a victory over the Rams, Atlanta wide receiver Andre Rison 
had to ask the interviewer what team the Falcons were playing this week. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Based on 1993 won-lost records, Kansas City has the toughest schedule in the 
NFL and Tampa Bay the easiest. The Raiders have the fourth-toughest among the 
28 teams and the Rams the 11th-toughest. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 San Diego will have to travel the most for exhibition and regular-season 
games, 41,712 miles, and Detroit the least -- 10,832 miles. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NFL coaches are gambling more on short-yardage, fourth-down plays because of a 
new rule that puts the ball at the spot of the kick instead of the line of 
scrimmage after a missed field-goal attempt. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There were some prolific passing performances Sunday and Monday, but nobody 
threatened the opening-day record of 554 yards set by Norm Van Brocklin of the 
Rams against the New York Yanks in 1951. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Minnesota Vikings must have made some kind of history when they cut two 
Heisman Trophy winning quarterbacks, Gino Torretta and Andre Ware, during the 
exhibition season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 ABC commentator Bob Griese, on UCLA wide receivers J.J. Stokes and Kevin 
Jordan: "The fun part is watching them run after they catch the ball." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: Bruin freshman fullback Greg Ford and Jean Claude Van Damme. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm still waiting for the Big Ten, which has 11 teams, to change its name. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky told it like it is when he said this would be a horrendous time 
to have an NHL strike. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What would you have thought a couple of years ago if someone had told you 
9,000 fans would show up for a hockey scrimmage in Anaheim on Labor Day of 
1994? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Clipper ticket packages for seven games at Anaheim Arena are going a lot 
faster than for the rest of the home schedule at the Sports Arena. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among the 32 nominees for the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame are Nolan 
Ryan, Eric Dickerson, Clyde Wright and Steve Scott. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Maddox will be in action next week at Anaheim Stadium -- on Tuesday he 
will be guest speaker at the Orange County Sports Assn.'s newsmakers' luncheon. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dan Crowley, who died last week at 87, coached the Crowley All-Stars against 
the USC varsity baseball team 62 consecutive years. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among those who played for Crowley were Len Dykstra, Joe Gordon, Bobby Grich, 
Ralph Kiner, Bob Lemon, Gene Mauch and Darryl Strawberry. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Where They Are Now? Former USC assistant and Cal State Northridge coach Rod 
Humenuik is defensive line coach at Kansas State. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Valdez, who was a terrific young jockey on the Southern California major 
league circuit two decades ago before having weight problems, is riding on the 
Northern California fair circuit. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jim Healy used to say that Ike Williams, the former lightweight champion who 
died the other day at 71, was the best all-round fighter he had ever seen. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams was a rarity, a slick boxer with enough punching power to knock out 
60 of his 153 opponents. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He beat one of Los Angeles' all-time favorite fighters, Enrique Bolanos, three 
times here, in 1946, 1948 and 1949. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Soft spoken and gracious, Williams was a regular at the Forum and Grand 
Olympic fights recently. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Baseball update: Negotiators have met three times during the strike that is in 
its 27th day.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; WASHINGTON NO SECRET TO PATERNO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Penn State Coach Joe Paterno was asked Tuesday about USC freshman tailback 
Delon Washington, who ran for 109 yards in his debut against Washington on 
Saturday. USC plays at Penn State on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know all about him," Paterno said. "Some people said last year he was the 
best high school running back in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington played for Kimball High in Dallas last season, rushing for 1,579 
yards and scoring 15 touchdowns.  
</P>
<P>
 USC's starting tailback is sophomore Shawn Walters, of Lamar High in nearby 
Arlington, Tex. While Walters and Washington were gaining 200 yards against 
Washington, Lamar beat Kimball before 25,000 at the Cotton Bowl Saturday 
afternoon, 27-7. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC came out of the Washington game with no new major injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 Backup tailback Leonard Green and linebacker Gerald Caruthers, who didn't play 
against the Huskies, are both listed as possible for Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson said Green will play against Penn State, as will freshman 
wide receiver Larry Parker. USC is thin at wide receiver, with both Keyshawn 
Johnson and Ed Hervey slowed by injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson also said he will find playing time for freshman tailback Rodney 
Sermons, who didn't play Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson blamed quarterback Rob Johnson's six sacks against Washington 
Saturday on a mix of injured wide receivers, coaching and Johnson's own 
reluctance to throw the ball away on failed pass plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob will not turn the ball loose unless he knows where it's going," Robinson 
said. "We need him to dump it a bit more, but we also need our receivers 
healthy and for them not to leave him hanging in there, too." EARL GUSTKEY

 Redshirt sophomore quarterback Chris Walsh has withdrawn from Miami, Coach

 "Where he is going to transfer, I don't know," Erickson said. "I didn't want 
him to leave, but I wanted him to do what he thinks is best."

 Walsh, brother of former Miami All-American Steve Walsh, returned to his home 
in St. Paul, Minn., according to Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 After redshirting his first year with the program, Walsh played one game in 
1993, serving as a backup to Frank Costa and Ryan Collins.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; AYERS BOOSTS RUNNING GAME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Derek Ayers is back, taking his turn in the UCLA backfield and trying to make 
up for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayers, a sophomore, had never been in better shape as two-a-day practices 
began in August. He had gained nine pounds over the summer, maintained his 
speed and was ready to challenge Sharmon Shah for the starting spot at 
tailback. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, he was on the sideline, wearing the red jersey of the injured and 
watching because of a sprained knee ligament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football is fun, but that's no fun at all," he said Tuesday, his 
rehabilitation complete. "You feel a little out of things. You're still a part 
of the team. You go to meetings and watch what's going on, but you're not a 
part of it because you can't play." 
</P>
<P>
 His return bolsters depth at running back, seemingly the Bruins' deepest 
position until injuries cropped up in the weeks before the season opener 
against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to do anything," Ayers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything includes taking a turn at tailback and spending time at receiver in 
the Bruins' four-wide receiver offensive sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anywhere they'll give me a chance," Ayers said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Methodist is 4-0 against UCLA, but the teams haven't met in 47 years. 
In 1947, the Mustangs won, 7-0, when Doak Walker, a Football Hall of Fame 
member, scored on a one-yard touchdown and kicked the extra point at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the SMU team's first chartered airplane trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The game took a bizarre twist when play stopped and SMU players got on hands 
and knees to look for a bridge that had fallen from the mouth of teammate 
Raleigh Blakely. 
</P>
<P>
 SMU has played in the Rose Bowl, losing to Stanford, 7-0, in 1935. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Long snapper Chris Anderson, a walk-on for three seasons, has been given a 
scholarship. . . . Former UCLA kicker Louis Perez spent Tuesday working with 
senior Martin Melius and freshman Morgan Janger, who were two people recruited 
from the student body, rather than from the team, to evaluate their ability to 
serve as backups to Bruin kicker Bjorn Merten.

 One of college football's longest team records was broken by Washington 
State's Mark Fields, who returned a fumble 71 yards in the Cougars' 10-9 
victory over Illinois last week. The old record, 70 yards, was set by Elmer 
Brown in 1899 against Idaho. JIM HODGES

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: IT HAS BEEN A WHALE OF A SUMMER OFF SANTA BARBARA 
COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What a summer it has been off the Santa Barbara coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue whales moved into the channel to feed several weeks ago, providing 
whale-watchers a rare opportunity to view the world's largest creatures up 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed the leviathans would never leave, but they appeared to have had 
enough a week or so ago when killer whales moved into the channel and started 
harassing their larger cousins, providing whale-watchers an even rarer 
opportunity.  
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't attacking them, but they were chasing them down and running 
after them," said Fred Benko, skipper of the Condor, which has been taking 
passengers to the whales from its port at Santa Barbara Sea Landing. "They were 
relentless, just bullying the blues." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Benko says, the killer whales, or orcas, have left and the blue 
whales have returned, at times swimming alongside Benko's boat with dozens of 
smaller humpback whales. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a week of pretty poor sightings, and some irate passengers during that 
week," Benko said. "But now it seems there are more whales than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
 The whales are feeding on krill, tiny shrimp-like creatures that have flooded 
the channel in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Divers have been reporting strange happenings off the Central California coast 
near Point Lobos: low-frequency sounds they say they can feel through their 
wetsuits.

<P>
 Officials with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary have been 
investigating the source of the sounds, which one diver said were "loud enough 
to rattle your lungs," but nobody has been able to explain the phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Naval postgraduate school in Monterey said it has not been conducting 
any tests in the area, which might have explained the source of the short 
bursts of sound -- occurring at depths to 90 feet at six-second intervals.  
</P>
<P>
 One theory is that the noises are the mating calls of a small fish commonly 
called midshipmen because of their skins' resemblance to navy garb. The 
courting fish have been known to keep local houseboat owners awake at night 
with their low-frequency calls. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the sounds have been occurring during the day so experts are puzzled. 
"We're trying, but we haven't been able to track it down yet," Aaron King, a 
spokesman for the sanctuary, said Tuesday. 
</P>

 Aside from the waves that have been pounding the south shore of Oahu, it has 
been a relatively uneventful summer in Hawaii. Tiger sharks have been no 
problem. "It's been unusually quiet," said John Naughton, a Honolulu biologist 
for the National Marine Fisheries Service. "For nothing at all to happen is 
really quite unusual."  
</P>
<P>
 Only a year ago, Oahu was embroiled in a full-blown shark scare, as claims of 
shark sightings flooded the state almost daily. The scare may have stemmed from 
a series of attacks the previous winter on the north shore of the island, which 
led to a series of shark hunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Naughton credits the hunts -- which led to the killing of dozens of large 
tiger sharks -- for the lack of attacks and sightings around Oahu this year. 
And the shark issue was all but forgotten until Monday, when an 8-year-old girl 
suffered lacerations after she was bitten by something while swimming off 
Makaha on Oahu's west shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Naughton, however, termed the attack a "nothing event" and said it had yet to 
be determined if it was even a shark that bit the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been a small shark, or it could have been a moray eel for all 
we know," he said. Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 HUNTING -- Thunderstorms scattered the birds at times, but some hunters were 
able to shoot their 10-dove limits on opening day last Thursday. The best 
hunting was apparently in the Niland area of Imperial County and the area 
around Winterhaven near Yuma, Ariz. Hunters reported concentrations of birds in 
both areas. In the San Joaquin Valley, limits were more difficult to come by. 
Lowell Kolb, 60, of Seal Beach reported an average of about five birds per 
hunter during the first two days of the season -- the first half of which 
closes Sept. 15. "Some did better than others and limited out," Kolb said. "But 
we hunted in three different places, but hardly saw anything at all. We ended 
up walking through the vineyards and had to scare up the birds. It wasn't bad 
as it was in the worst years but it was not very good." 
</P>
<P>
 FISHING -- Local waters are thick with bonito, with boats averaging 50-60 a 
day, and fishermen at Catalina and off the Palos Verdes Peninsula are enjoying 
an excellent calico bass bite as well. Marlin fishing has picked up offshore, 
and Avalon Seafood had weighed 43 fish as of Tuesday morning. Yellowtail are 
reportedly abundant at the oil rigs off Huntington Beach, but the fish refuse 
to bite. Top catch: a 10-pound king salmon that somehow strayed down the coast. 
It was picked up Sunday by an angler aboard the City of Redondo.  
</P>
<P>
 San Diego long-range: Skippers of overnight boats are hoping that, for once, 
the fish will remain in a feeding mood. The fleet reported impressive counts of 
yellowfin tuna, yellowtail and dorado for the first time in weeks on Monday and 
on Tuesday boated nothing but yellowfin -- 142 of them for 42 passengers, which 
isn't bad considering the poor counts in recent weeks. Farther down the Baja 
California coast, the fish are more cooperative as anglers on four-day trips 
are putting hundreds of yellowfin tuna and yellowtail on the decks.  
</P>
<P>
 Cabo San Lucas: What few people are visiting Land's End are suffering heat and 
humidity but enjoying outstanding fishing for blue marlin, tuna and dorado. The 
Picses Fleet reported one angler catching and releasing a blue marlin, then 
catching 14 yellowfin tuna and 11 dorado. The blue marlin are not huge, but 
they are plentiful. The tuna are mostly in the 10- to 25-pound class, but the 
Gaviota Fleet weighed in one at 171 pounds. The dorado are mostly 15-40 pounds. 
Fishing remains steady up the gulf side of the peninsula to and beyond the East 
Cape. At Loreto, dorado are abundant but small, averaging about 10 pounds. 
Sailfish averaging 85 pounds are abundant as well. 
</P>
<P>
 CALENDAR -- Baja California fishing expert Neil Kelly will give a seminar on 
the subject Thursday from 7-9 p.m. at Discover Baja Travel Club's San Diego 
office. Details: (619) 275-4225. . . . Hal Jannsen, an expert on still-water 
fly fishing for trout, is making the rounds at the local clubs, giving 
presentations Sept. 13 at the Downey Fly Fishers' meeting, (310) 425-7936; 
Sept. 14 at the Pasadena Casting Club, (818) 449-1152, and Sept. 15 at the 
Conejo Valley Fly Fishers, (805) 496-7332.

FISHING REPORT: HUGE STRIPER TAKES BAIT AT SILVERWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of the thousands of fish to come out of Southland reservoirs this past week, 
one fish stands out: a 48-pound 13-ounce striped bass pulled from Silverwood 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Harleman of Norco fooled the fish with an anchovy while fishing aboard 
his boat at about 5 p.m. last Friday. The striper, a lake record, measured 47 
1/4 inches and had a 32 1/2-inch girth.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: SEASON PROMISES TO BE NOTABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some thoughts on the coming football season:  
</P>
<P>
 Postgame handshakes should not only be allowed, they should be mandatory. 
Players need to recognize that what they are involved in is a rivalry, not a 
war. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sportsmanship seems to have gone out the window in recent years. Now, more 
then ever, it needs a comeback. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Although the Southern Section has restructured its leagues and divisions this 
year, more changes are on the horizon. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is expected to form its own section next year, and Commissioner 
Dean Crowley wants to regionalize what remains of the Southern Section. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, we would have four regions that would have their own championships, 
with winners advancing to a final four format," said Crowley, who received a 
vote of confidence and a pay raise from the Executive Committee in July. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 All of this means the Southern Section's top football division might never be 
this strong again. Defending champion Rialto Eisenhower must contend with such 
powers as La Puente Bishop Amat, Santa Ana Mater Dei, Loyola and Los Alamitos, 
among others. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Expectations are high at Bishop Amat, where rookie Coach Tom Salter inherits a 
team loaded with talent. The Lancers, however, have a reputation for choking in 
the playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Salter, 32, appears to be in a win-win situation. If Bishop Amat wins the 
title, he is a hero. If it does not, he can say it was only his first year. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter replaced Mark Paredes, who left the high-profile program after eight 
seasons to take over at Riverside North. Watch for North to be an instant 
contender. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat may be the Southland's top-rated team, but Los Alamitos cannot be 
counted out. The Griffins have not lost in a title game the last three years. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 The move up to Division I should prove an interesting challenge for Los 
Alamitos Coach John Barnes, whose team has the state's longest unbeaten streak 
at 35 games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We're a finesse team," said Barnes. "We have to find other ways to win. 
Honestly, I go into every game thinking, 'How in the world are we going to beat 
these guys?' " . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is also home to the state's longest winless streak. Ocean View 
of Huntington Beach is 0-29 the last three seasons. Los Angeles Jordan is 0-26 
during that time. . . It will be a rebuilding year for Eisenhower, which 
finished 14-0 last season after routing Mater Dei in the Southern Section 
Division I title game, 56-3. The Eagles have a young and inexperienced team. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Harry Welch recently ended an eventful run as coach at Canyon Country Canyon, 
but he hints he may soon return to the game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Carson and Taft are early favorites to battle for the City Section's Division 
4-A title. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Carson defeated Dorsey in last year's 4-A championship game, 26-0, for a 
record ninth title. The Colts, who have made 18 appearances in the final, 
should be just as strong this season with several key returning starters. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Taft Coach Troy Starr was nearly fired last spring for questionable recruiting 
techniques but was given a second chance by Principal Ron Berz. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Starr has plenty of talent to work with. Running back Jerry Brown, who rushed 
for 1,761 yards last season, is the half-brother of USC Heisman Trophy winner 
Charles White. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The City Section has a new playoff format this season, with its top 16 teams 
in the 4-A bracket and the next 16 in the 3-A. This makes the 3-A title almost 
meaningless. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the Southland will be one of the most heavily recruited areas in 
the nation. College coaches cite the favorable climate and large population as 
main reasons for so many quality programs. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most years, there are not many quarterback prospects. But recruiters 
will have plenty of wide receivers, linebackers and defensive backs to choose 
from. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The top prospect is Daylon McCutcheon of Bishop Amat. The 5-foot-10, 175-pound 
senior plays in both the offensive and defensive backfields and returns kicks 
and punts. He is the son of former Ram running back Lawrence McCutcheon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He may not get many scholarship offers because of his size, but running back 
Jermaine Lewis of Antelope Valley is fun to watch. Lewis, 5-6 and 150, gained 
1,541 yards last season and is expected to break 2,000 this season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A sad sign of the times: The season will be considered a success if no games 
are interrupted by drive-by shootings or bench-clearing brawls.

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON: LONG BEACH FOCUSES ON PRESENT AS IT 
SHOOTS FOR ANOTHER TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Gimmillaro, coach of the Long Beach State women's volleyball team, 
recently tried to convince a group of reporters that the past is all but 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Long Beach won the national championship last season, when it 
finished 32-2 and won a share of its third consecutive Big West Conference 
title. And forget about Danielle Scott, who dominated the sport last year 
before completing her eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gimmillaro, that's ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, there are some things I am very disciplined about and some things I 
am not, and one of the things that I have always been very disciplined about is 
that I can only see this team," Gimmillaro said. "I have good focus on this 
team, what we do and what we need to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The first order of business is trying to replace Scott, the 1993 national 
player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 With the departure of Scott, a 6-foot-2 middle blocker, the spotlight will 
fall on Nichelle Burton, a senior outside hitter. Burton has always played in 
the shadows of great players -- before Scott, the 49ers were led by Antoinnette 
White, the 1991 national player of the year -- but this should be Burton's 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 There seems little doubt she is ready for the challenge. Last season, she had 
a career-high 28 kills in the NCAA final against Penn State. In their season 
opener last Thursday, Burton led the 49ers with 21 kills in a 15-6, 14-16, 
15-11, 15-6 victory over Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burton can't carry the team alone. The task of replacing Scott at middle 
blocker falls on the young shoulders of Nique Crump, a 6-1 freshman from Mesa, 
Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Crump stumbled out of the gate at Long Beach, injuring her Achilles' tendon on 
the first day of practice. She was further hindered when the NCAA denied her 
eligibility because her high school transcript was not properly stamped. Crump 
sat out a match against the Long Beach alumni on Aug. 27 but was cleared to 
play last Thursday and had four kills and two solo blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Crump will be joined at middle blocker by returning starter Traci Dahl. Other 
returning starters are Brita Schwerm, an outside hitter, and Prentice Perkins, 
a defensive specialist. Kristin Harris, a freshman outside hitter from San 
Jose, also is expected to start. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Price, a freshman from Tempe, Ariz., and Heather Hofmans, a sophomore who 
was a reserve last season, will compete for the setter spot, which was left 
vacant when Joy McKienzie finished her eligibility last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (1-1) is ranked eighth in the American Volleyball Coaches Assn. 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one thing everybody wants to know about the 49ers, and Gimmillaro 
answered the big question before it could be asked: 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we going to contend (for the national championship)? Not yet, but 
possibly (later)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Banachowski, UCLA coach, echoed that sentiment about his own team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins finished 30-2 last season and won their second consecutive Pacific 
10 Conference championship. They were disappointed, however, when they lost on 
their home court to BYU in the West Regional final and failed to advance to the 
NCAA Final Four for the first time since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (3-0), ranked second behind Stanford (3-0), has four starters back from 
last season, including All-American Annett Buckner, a senior outside hitter. 
The Bruins' biggest loss is at setter, where All-American Julie Bremner 
finished her eligibility last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we started out the year with question marks at the hitting 
position and solid at the setting (position), and I think the shoe is just 
reversed this year," Banachowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Flannigan, a sophomore who was a reserve last season, will start at 
setter. Kim Coleman, a freshman who led Corona del Mar High to national No. 1 
rankings in 1992 and 1993, will also compete for playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like a ship without a keel, USC will lurch ahead this season without Katie 
Haller, a four-year starter at outside hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Haller was the only All-American on last year's team, which was 22-9 overall 
and finished fourth in the Pac-10. USC has no one who can play at Haller's 
level, although Whitney Casey, a reserve last season, probably will try. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Lisa Love is hoping that what No. 15 USC (2-1) lacks in quality, it will 
compensate for with quantity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is, any way you slice it, we are very, very deep," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meika Wagner, a 6-0 senior middle blocker, will lead the Trojans. Wagner led 
the Pac-10 last season with a .329 hitting percentage and is a two-time 
all-conference selection. Other returning starters are Kelly Kuebler, an 
outside hitter, and Lauri Yust, a middle blocker. 
</P>
<P>
 Returners Capi Irato, Bonny Brunst and Kilee Hughes all had playing time last 
season at outside hitter and will compete for starting spots this year. Monika 
Cavaliere and Laurie Hill will battle for the starting setter spot, left vacant 
when Missy McCaw completed her eligibility last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount figures to challenge for the West Coast Conference title and 
Pepperdine hopes to improve on its fourth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions have all six starters back from last season, when they were 23-7 
overall and finished a game behind conference champion Santa Clara in the WCC. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (0-2) will be led by a pair of junior middle blockers, Mardell Wrensch 
and Julie Greer, who were both first-team all-conference selections last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine was 11-16 in 1993, its second consecutive losing season. This 
season, the Waves (1-2) will count on returning starters Tara Kroesch at 
outside hitter and Lauren Agajanian at setter.

FORMER DOLPHIN MATHESON DIES OF HODGKIN'S DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Matheson, a member of the "No-Name" defense that led the Miami Dolphins to 
three consecutive Super Bowls in the early 1970s, died after a long battle with 
Hodgkin's disease. He was 49. 
</P>
<P>
 Matheson died Monday at Duke University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-team All-American for Duke in 1966, Matheson was a first-round draft 
pick of the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the Dolphins in 1971 and was a key member of the "53 Defense" -- 
named for his uniform number -- that helped Miami finish 17-0 in the 1972 
season, the only perfect season in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that people really understood or understand now how important 
he was to that Dolphin defense," former teammate Nick Buoniconti said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins also won the Super Bowl the next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "His talents enabled us to do something new and unique with the '53' defense, 
which became one of our trademarks," Miami's Don Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
 Matheson stayed with Miami through the 1979 season, then returned to Duke as 
an assistant to Coach Red Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued coaching after he was found to have cancer, working for John 
Gutekunst at Minnesota from 1988 to 1990, but returned to Durham to work for 
the cancer research center there.

 Housing Completions Decline: The number of new homes finished and ready for 
occupancy fell for a second straight month in July, adding to signs that 
housing activity is leveling off, the Commerce Department said. Completions 
fell 4.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.27 million after a revised 
drop of 7.8% in June, previously reported as an 8.2% decline. The government's 
monthly measure of housing completions is not as closely watched as its report 
on construction starts, but it is useful as a monitor of overall activity in 
the home building industry.

 Blue chips stocks snapped a three-session losing streak Tuesday in quiet 
trading, while long-term interest rates rose and the dollar weakened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, the market's best-known barometer, rose 
13.12 points to 3,898.70, buoyed in part by American Express, General Motors 
and Eastman Kodak. Those shares rose amid company news. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other major market indicators edged higher, declining issues 
outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board 
volume fell to 199.86 million, the lowest on the NYSE since July 5, the day 
after the long Independence Day weekend. On Friday, 216.15 million shares 
changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks 
rose 0.87 point to 471.86, while the NYSE composite index rose 0.18 point to 
260.11. The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.25 point to 759.48, while at the 
American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.46 point to 456.00. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little news to move stock prices in either direction following Labor 
Day on Monday and Rosh Hashanah on Tuesday, said David Holt, director of 
technical research at Wedbush Morgan Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is a lack of buyers rather than an abundance of sellers," Holt 
said. "It's difficult to come back from a three-day holiday and start doing 
anything immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields, meanwhile, rose in light trading Tuesday, weakened by a further 
selloff in the dollar and renewed investor worries about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield rose to 7.53% from 7.49% on Friday, 
pushing its price, which moves in the opposite direction, down half a point, or 
$5 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of short-term maturities were between 3/32 point and 5/32 point lower, 
and intermediate maturities ranged from 9/32 point to 11/32 point lower, the 
Telerate Inc. financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency market, the dollar weakened further against key currencies, 
extending last week's selloff, on rising demand for German marks and pessimism 
about U.S.-Japanese trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading volume was light, which exaggerated the extent of the dollar's moves. 
But U.S. foreign exchange traders returning from the three-day weekend said the 
underlying selling pressure on the dollar was strong. They foresaw little 
reason to buy dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 The greenback closed in New York at 1.543 German marks, down from its 1.556 
closing level Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It also weakened to 98.64 Japanese yen, down from Friday's 99.12. 
</P>
<P>
 Weak stock prices abroad also helped depress the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican shares closed sharply higher after reversing earlier losses in a 
technical rebound late in the session, analysts said. The Bolsa index gained 
38.04 points to close at a session high of 2,704.07, after earlier falling as 
low as 2,642.72. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the Financial Times 100-share average was hit by the weakness of 
bonds and closed down 36.1 points, or 1.11%, at 3,205.4. Frankfurt's 30-share 
DAX average ended down 8.62 points at 2,165.90, while Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei 
average fell 15.20 points to 20,393.98. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stocks giving the Dow average a boost, American Express rose 1 3/8 
to 30 3/8 after the company launched a credit card it says is a better deal for 
users who don't pay off balances right away. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Motors jumped 2 1/8 to 52 1/4, rising with the issues of other auto 
makers as they released good data on August car sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hilton Hotels rose 5 5/8 to 64 3/8 amid rumors the company might be 
acquired. Hilton denied it was considering any offers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nextel Communications rose 7/8 to 23 3/8. J.P. Morgan Securities lowered a 
rating on the stock saying the previous, higher rating was made because of the 
Nextel-MCI deal, which fell apart last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kodak will sell its Clinical Diagnostics unit to Johnson & Johnson for 
$1.008 billion in cash, the two companies said. Kodak rose 1 1/8 to 51 1/4; 
Johnson & Johnson dipped 1/8 to 50. 
</P>
<P>
 * Acclaim Entertainment gained 1/2 to 20 5/8. The company said last week that 
its "motion-capture" technology is being used by Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 * AST rose 5/16 to 13 9/16 in dividend-related trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * Echo Bay Mines gained 3/8 to 13 1/4 as gold stocks rose with the precious 
metal amid concern about inflation prompted in part by Friday's August 
employment report. Many investors buy gold as a hedge against cost-of-living 
increases. Sunshine Mining rose 1/8 to 2 1/8 and American Barrick jumped 3/8 to 
23 1/2.

UFW STEPS UP ORGANIZING EFFORTS IN AREA; LABOR: THE DRIVE IS THE MOST INTENSIVE 
ACTIVITY IN THE COUNTY SINCE 1990. THE FOCUS IS ON TWO FIRMS IN OXNARD AND 
MOORPARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cesar Chavez's son-in-law, national president of the United Farm Workers, is 
working the fields in Ventura County in the most intensive farm labor 
organizing activity here since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Rodriguez has been working in the county for a month, solidifying union 
membership and lobbying growers and packers for better contracts -- 
concentrating on Moorpark's Muranaka Farms and Dole Food Co.'s Oxnard 
subsidiary as part of a statewide campaign to reinvigorate the beleaguered 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is most definitely a decision to refocus attention on Ventura," union 
negotiator Mario Brito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a stronghold of support with more than 4,000 union members, United Farm 
Worker membership in Ventura County reflects a statewide decline and now has 
dropped to just 500. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the local union office had only one representative, Brito said. 
Now, along with negotiator Brito, there are five local representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time is right for organizing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was in Fresno during the Labor Day weekend for the union's first 
national convention since the death of Cesar Chavez in the spring of 1993. He 
will meet today in Moorpark with lawyers from Muranaka Farms to discuss health 
benefits and pay increases for the company's 150 workers, who have been without 
a contract since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Brito joined other union members who picketed the Muranaka Farms 
packinghouse on Los Angeles Avenue in Moorpark. Brito said the union was 
prepared to take further action and would not rule out a strike if negotiations 
did not progress at a faster pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez is also helping local organizers prepare for a fight over union 
representation at Dole's Oceanview Produce. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first vote for representation at a county company since 1990, workers 
in recent months voted 298 to 278 in favor of union representation. The victory 
was one in a recent series of seven the union has achieved across the state, 
but it was short-lived. The company contested the vote, laying off 450 
strawberry workers the day the final results were released. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said the union election had no bearing on the timing of the 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a business decision that we made long before the outcome of the 
election was known," said Thomas Pernice, a Los Angeles-based spokesman for the 
Dole Food Co. Inc. "Harvesting strawberries is no longer profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Pernice said the union was targeting Dole because of its high profile. "We 
certainly can see that they have intensified their efforts recently," he said. 
"I think they selected Dole because people recognize the name and (the union) 
sees a good opportunity to get publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 A representative from the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board, which is 
reviewing the election and actions by both Dole and the union in the election 
aftermath, said the dispute is "going to get messy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here a long time and it seems like things are heating up again," 
said Norma Turner, the acting executive secretary for the Agricultural Labor 
Relations Board in Sacramento. "Week by week we are seeing an increase of 
activity -- from more election petitions to complaints. The numbers have been 
growing." 
</P>
<P>
 The board has scheduled a Monday hearing in Oxnard to review complaints by 
Dole that the union intimidated workers before the election. The board also 
plans to review union complaints against the company, but a date for that 
hearing has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite indications of growing union activism, including reports the union has 
signed 10,000 new members nationwide this year alone, local critics of the 
organization are saying the union is still on the decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aware of the rhetoric, but their activity is extremely limited," said Rex 
Laird, executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. "They pick up some 
headlines with some of their bravado, but in terms of what's measurable or 
quantifiable those are the only two things I've heard about locally."

LOW RIDERSHIP PLAGUES VISTA BUSES; TRANSIT: TO QUALIFY FOR STATE MONEY WHEN A 
TWO-YEAR FEDERAL GRANT RUNS OUT, THE FOUR LUXURY LINES NEED A LOT MORE 
PASSENGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Traffic was heavy as bus driver Ralph Lopez steered his empty VISTA coach to 
an unoccupied Simi Valley bus stop Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Engine running, air conditioning blasting, Lopez leaned back and waited as 
cars whizzed past the bus at the corner of Madera Road and Los Angeles Avenue. 
Ten minutes later, he revved the engine of his still-empty coach and headed 
north to Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 If ridership tallies for July and the first half of August are any indication, 
Lopez would be lucky to pick up half a dozen passengers on his hourly run 
between Moorpark, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Passenger counts for the first month and a half of the countywide service show 
a less than enthusiastic response for the Ventura Intercity Service Transit 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 From July 5 to Aug. 19, the most popular route between Ventura, Santa Paula 
and Fillmore carried a daily average of 146 riders. 
</P>
<P>
 About 139 riders a day rode VISTA buses between Ventura and Thousand Oaks, 
while buses between Oxnard and Camarillo carried a daily average of 62 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 VISTA buses between Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Moorpark shuttled about 60 
passengers a day, barely enough to fill one of the 19 buses traversing the 
route from 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Since VISTA began in early July as a two-year, $3.8-million trial service 
funded largely with federal dollars, the buses have traveled to each of the 
county's 10 cites, providing unprecedented countywide public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for state funding when the two-year federal grant runs out, a 
minimum of 200 to 400 passengers a day will have to ride each of the four VISTA 
lines, transportation officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Travis, transit coordinator for the Ventura County Transportation 
Commission, said initial low ridership is expected in launching a new public 
transportation service. Once residents learn about the service, however, they 
will be more willing to try it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new service uses luxury coaches with restrooms, costs only $1 for a 
typical adult ticket and provides far more connections than ever before 
available in Ventura County, linking city-run bus systems and stopping at 
Metrolink train stations in Moorpark and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis said she expects an advertising blitz timed to coincide with the start 
of the school year, to boost ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are less optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Councilman Bill Davis, who serves on the commission, said he 
doesn't expect ridership to increase substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not happy with these numbers," Davis said. "I don't really see any 
improvement unless we can attract some of the students." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard, chairwoman of the commission, said unless more 
residents use public transportation, the county will have a difficult time 
reducing pollution to levels that will comply with federal mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not anticipate that this would be a roaring success right from the 
start, and I'm not sure it will ever be a roaring success," she said. "But we 
have to make sure people know that with (federal pollution control mandates) 
we're going to have to work hard to cut down on the chief polluter, which is 
our cars." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 VISTA buses run Mondays through Fridays from about 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Some 
routes offer hourly service, while others offer service every half-hour. There 
is no weekend service. Fares are $1 for adults, 75 cents for students and 50 
cents for senior citizens. Passengers must have exact fare. Monthly passes, 
which can be purchased by phone or at any city hall in the county, are $34 for 
adults, $26 for students and $15 for seniors. Passes may also be used on city 
buses throughout the county. For information, call (800) 438-1112.

DEVELOPER ORDERED TO HALT LAGOON PUMPING; ORMOND BEACH: BALDWIN CO. FACES UP TO 
$6,000 PER DAY IN FINES IF IT CONTINUES TO REMOVE WATER FROM ITS PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A state agency Tuesday ordered an Ormond Beach landowner and developer to stop 
pumping water from a natural lagoon where endangered species live, or face 
fines of up to $6,000 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baldwin Co.'s pumping of the lagoon to reduce flooding on its property at 
Ormond Beach appears to be a violation of the California Coastal Act, the 
California Coastal Commission said in a "stop-work" order faxed to the 
developer late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, all 20 to 30 acres of inundated Baldwin property have been designated a 
wetlands partly because the parcel has flooded periodically for decades, state 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears from our investigation that not only are they draining the system, 
but they put a dike in one of the canals to prevent water from migrating onto 
their property," said Christopher Price, a Coastal Commission analyst. "That 
requires a permit." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is also investigating whether a federal 
permit for pumping is required as well, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin officials, who want to build 5,000 residences on the beachfront 
property just north of Port Hueneme and south of the Southern California Edison 
Ormond Beach generating plant, said they would check with attorneys before 
complying with the order. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the Coastal Commission is misinformed and a little confused," 
company owner James Baldwin said. "They indicated we have built dirt dikes, but 
we haven't built any dirt dikes. We have done limited sandbagging to protect 
our property, and we have pumped some water." 
</P>
<P>
 The flooding occurred when the J Street and E Street canals that drain gutters 
and ditches in the city of Oxnard emptied into the lagoon, which this year has 
no outlet to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Water in the J Street Canal is also pumped from Bubbling Springs Creek by the 
county Flood Control District to prevent flooding on nearby Hueneme Road. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, the flood-control district has breached a sandbar each spring 
to drain the lagoon. But last year the flood-control district agreed to suspend 
the practice while endangered least terns nested and their young matured. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in March the endangered tidewater goby fish was also found in the J 
Street Canal. Regulatory agencies notified the flood-control district that it 
needed a permit to drain the lagoon again. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baldwin, which wants the lagoon flooding stopped immediately, has 
threatened to sue the district for illegally taking its land if the county does 
not stop pumping water from the springs to the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the company's land is now vacant, and there are no existing permits 
to develop it, owner Baldwin said he is acting partly to establish a precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our concern is that if we allow water to be pumped onto our property now, 
that we'll never get them to stop," he said. "A lot of people would like to 
call land that is not a wetland, a wetland. We feel there is a concerted effort 
to cause this (flooding) to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But the flood-control district cannot stop pumping water from Bubbling Springs 
without flooding public streets, district head Alex Sheydayi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't even examined that possibility because it's not negotiable," 
Sheydayi said. 
</P>
<P>
 To both avert a possible Baldwin lawsuit and clear outlets from Bubbling 
Springs, the district applied for permission Tuesday from the Army Corps of 
Engineers to begin its own pumping of the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 According to its application, the district would pump water from the 
six-foot-deep lagoon over the sandbar and into the ocean, lowering the water 
level by up to 2 1/2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping to be out there doing something (next) Monday," Sheydayi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps has not determined whether the pumping will be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The pumping will have to be evaluated for its effect on the animals and 
wetlands, said David Castanon, the corps' local chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, what looks like a small project can have big impacts," he said. He 
said if all the concerns of agencies such as the California Department of Fish 
and Game and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service are met it is possible a permit 
could be issued this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Price of the Coastal Commission said the flood-control district also needs a 
state permit to begin pumping. But Sheydayi said the city of Oxnard could also 
issue such a permit and was preparing a city application Tuesday.

RINGING IN SCHOOL YEAR; CLASS SEARCH, HOMEWORK GREET WEST COUNTY STUDENTS ON 
THEIR RETURN

 Posted on the door of Michelle Townsley's sixth-grade classroom at El Rio 
School in Oxnard is a sign that reads: "Free knowledge Monday through Friday. 
Bring your own container." 
</P>
<P>
 It is, the teacher said, an offer that applies to each of her 30 or so 
sixth-graders, who joined thousands of children in west Ventura County 
returning to school Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping they might get the subtle informal message that if they bring 
their brain, it will get filled," said Townsley, who put her students to work 
right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will definitely have homework," she said. "It'll probably be 
journal-writing, but not about summer vacation. Everybody does that." 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of Ventura County's 119,000 schoolchildren made their way to 
classes Tuesday, as school opened for high school students in Oxnard and 
Camarillo and for elementary school students in Camarillo, Somis and El Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes in Ventura, Santa Paula and Ojai resume today, while students in 
Thousand Oaks, Moorpark and Simi Valley begin their fall schedules Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elementary students in the Oxnard School District and schools in Fillmore 
operate on year-round calendars. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer's unofficial end came abruptly for 15-year-old Diana Briceno, who was 
waiting in line early Tuesday morning for her schedule of classes at Oxnard's 
Channel Islands High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little bit nervous," the sophomore said. "It's a big change from ninth 
grade to 10th grade. It's going to be a lot harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Allan Estivitz is not worried about his full schedule of classes, which 
includes oceanography, English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be easier because I'm used to school," said Estivitz, who plans 
to attend Ventura College next year. "But it goes by real quick. It seems like 
just yesterday I was a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time Tuesday, the Oxnard Police Department assigned three 
full-time officers to the neighborhoods surrounding the high schools to help 
prevent gang-related or illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our effort to address stuff going on at the beginning of school," 
Assistant Chief Jim Latimer said. "We wanted to try something different this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands Principal John Triolo said attendance was up slightly from a 
year ago at the south Oxnard high school. Minutes after the 8 a.m. bell, dozens 
of students were still lined up, waiting to enroll in courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "First period is always a little shaky on the first day of school," Triolo 
said. "But after that, the school runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students wandered around the Channel Islands campus Tuesday, looking for 
a room number on maps or asking one of 10 campus supervisors how to get to 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to chase everybody into the classrooms," said Moa Saipale, one of the 
hall monitors. "It's really busy because of the new freshmen. None of them know 
where to go." 
</P>
<P>
 In Camarillo, vandals broke four classroom windows at Tierra Linda School, the 
Pleasant Valley School District's new elementary campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Dianne Quinby-Anders said someone smashed the windows late Monday or 
early Tuesday. By class time, however, cardboard boxes were placed into the 
window frames of Stephanie D'Andrea's first-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinby-Anders said the opening day of school went smoothly, even though more 
children showed up than the 713 spaces the school was designed for. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already pushed it to the max," the principal said. "(But) there's so 
much growth in the area and we have no funds for another school." 
</P>
<P>
 Registration is based on a first-come, first-served basis for students who 
live in the Mission Oaks neighborhoods of Camarillo, Quinby-Anders said. The 
additional students will be bused to another nearby school, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Oxnard High School, students are looking forward to vacating the run-down, 
graffiti-scarred campus next spring, when work on the new Gonzales Road campus 
is finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is really gross. It's dirty and there's lots of graffiti," 
16-year-old junior Erin Stanfield said. "When students are going to a place 
like this they don't have any pride in their school."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; DISTRICT HONORS RIO MESA TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Rio Mesa High School teacher who stresses to her students the value of 
cultural diversity has been named Teacher of the Year in the Oxnard Union High 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Pecht, a 42-year-old English teacher, received the honor at an employee 
awards assembly last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely flattered," Pecht said Friday. "I've been on cloud nine." 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to Rio Mesa in Camarillo about 12 years ago, Pecht taught at 
Camarillo High and at private Santa Clara High School in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she will teach only English classes this fall, Pecht said she has 
spent most of her career teaching both English and art. In all her classes, 
Pecht said she strives to help her students recognize their individual gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to see students as each having a talent of their own, their own 
personal gift and try to bring that out," she said. "I just look for something 
they do that's special." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pecht said she has always tried to nurture students' special gifts, 
she fully realized the importance of such individual attention after her own 
son, Ben, became a student at Rio Mesa several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me realize that every kid is somebody's child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way that Pecht seeks to instill pride in her students is to help them 
value their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa draws students from low-income La Colonia in Oxnard and plush Las 
Posas Estates outside Camarillo. Pecht has had some students in her classes who 
do not know a word of English. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Rio Mesa students graduate to Ivy League schools, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She deliberately teaches literature from various cultures and encourages 
discussion about cultural differences, Pecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to celebrate diversity." MAIA DAVIS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SYMPHONY-MUSICIAN TALKS AT STANDSTILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Contract negotiations between the Ventura County Symphony Assn. and its 
musicians have reached a standstill, with both sides accusing the other of 
stalling the process and jeopardizing the concert season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been threatening us with cancellations since the end of last season," 
said bassoonist Steven Thiroux, a member of the musicians' negotiating team."I 
feel we've negotiated in good faith (and) prepared a comprehensive proposal and 
they could not, or were unable, to respond to it in a timely manner." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mike Robbins, an attorney representing the symphony, said the union's 
chief negotiator has refused to meet with him for a one-on-one conference to 
discuss the biggest differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations mark the first time the musicians union has sought a contract 
with the 30-year-old community orchestra. The symphony agreed to bargain with 
the union last spring after the musicians threatened to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides have met four times, and no additional negotiating sessions are 
scheduled. The symphony is scheduled to kick off its season Oct. 8 with a 
concert in the Oxnard Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiroux accused the symphony's directors of jeopardizing the group's musical 
identity by only offering contracts to 20 musicians in an initial proposal. The 
symphony is normally composed of 30 to 60 musicians, depending on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't go in front of our members and say, 'Here's the proposal, and it's 
for 20 musicians,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robbins said the symphony's initial offer of 20 contracts was only a 
starting point in negotiations. It was a counteroffer to the union's demand 
that about 70 musicians be offered full-season contracts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it's true we initially proposed 20, and frankly we expected to be 
negotiating up to some degree," he said. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HOLIDAY WEEKEND SAFEST IN YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What Ventura County law enforcement officials had feared might be a deadly 
Labor Day holiday ended up being one of the quietest in recent years, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 No fatal traffic accidents were reported on county roads and highways during 
the three-day weekend, drunk-driving arrests were down appreciably, and 
visitors to the mountains and beaches were well-behaved for the most part, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, for the last two or three years, we have seen a decrease 
in (drunk-driving-related) accidents, and we've also seen a decrease in the 
number of (drunk-driving) arrests," California Highway Patrol Capt. Mike 
Porrazzo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county, the CHP arrested 28 motorists on suspicion of drunk driving 
over the three-day weekend, down from 45 arrests last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the CHP made 1,702 drunk-driving arrests over the holiday, 
contrasted with 2,070 last year, said CHP Lt. Greg Manuel in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Porrazzo, the CHP's area commander for Ventura County, attributed the decrease 
to heavy enforcement, stiffer penalties and more aggressive education 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the CHP, most other law enforcement agencies in the county reported a 
drop in drunk-driving arrests over the weekend. There were none reported in 
Fillmore, eight in Thousand Oaks, and two each in Ventura, Ojai, Simi Valley 
and Santa Paula. Only Port Hueneme, with five arrests, and Oxnard, with 18, 
reported more drunk-driving arrests this year than last. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Oxnard Police Cmdr. Jamie Skeeters said his department's figures were 
up because of a sobriety checkpoint Friday night at Oxnard Boulevard and 2nd 
Street, during which 1,100 vehicles were stopped. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MARKET FACES LOSS OF LIQUOR LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control will ask a judge next month 
to revoke the license of an Oxnard liquor store that has allegedly been selling 
beer and wine to minors for years. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC officials have filed a disciplinary action against the owner of the Stop 
N' Save Market at 1037 Ventura Road after an investigation uncovered numerous 
license violations, said Ed Macias, supervisor at the Santa Barbara ABC office. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynrose Dimalanta, the store's owner, has been cited 11 times since February 
for selling liquor to minors, authorities said. Before that, her father, T. 
Roman Paras, was cited nine times for the same offense, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimalanta could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC officials were trying to revoke Paras' license when he canceled it, and 
his daughter subsequently obtained a permit to sell alcohol at the same store. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in the process of being revoked on his own merits, but he canceled, 
and his daughter obtained a license based on her own moral character," Macias 
said. "We had no reason legally to condemn the daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 A trial date has been tentatively set for October. If Dimalanta's license is 
revoked, she will never be able to obtain another one and no one will be 
permitted to sell alcohol from the site for one year. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

LIBRARY APPRECIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for your article on Ventura County's libraries on Aug. 28. It was 
the most logical and thought-provoking story on local public libraries that I 
have seen.Those of us who work in the county library have felt very frustrated 
in recent years. We are trained to give service to the public, and we are aware 
of the needs of our communities, but we currently lack sufficient tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Public library service is a composite of many parts. Excellent service 
requires convenient and extensive operating hours. All service requires a safe, 
maintained building. Productive service requires a trained, dedicated and 
experienced staff to circulate books, help people find information and 
recreational material, and interact with kids in story times. Effective service 
requires sufficient informational and recreational materials that are regularly 
updated and augmented. 
</P>
<P>
 Practical service requires a central support staff to maintain library 
buildings, acquire and train new staff and volunteers, maintain the library's 
automated circulation system and other electronic equipment, select, purchase, 
process and transport materials to all libraries and integrate the service of 
individual libraries into an efficient, cooperative whole. All are necessary 
components. Each component has its own costs. 
</P>
<P>
 As funding decreased for the county library in the past few years, 
administrators made cuts in areas with the least public service impact, and 
actively sought more volunteers. Last year's deep financial cuts, however, 
reduced each component to little more than a skeleton holding together the 
framework of a public library system. Only the financial help of some cities 
and some other non-county entities has mitigated the effect on some 
communities.  
</P>
<P>
 Public libraries cannot exist to provide public benefit without public support 
and funding.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER HOME BUYER LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council tonight will consider setting up a $10-million fund 
to provide low-interest loans to first-time home buyers.  
</P>
<P>
 Using its authority as the city's Redevelopment Agency, the board can request 
a portion of a state bond that would cover the cost of the program, said 
Richard Hare, assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program is approved by the council and the state approves the request, 
loans would be available to first-time buyers in the city, Hare said. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, applicants cannot earn more than the median income in the county. 
For instance, a single person or couple cannot earn more than $57,900 to be 
eligible. The highest price of housing that could be purchased under the 
program is $231,120. SCOTT HADLY

VOTED CONSCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'd like to commend Congressman Elton Gallegly for his vote in support of the 
crime bill.This was not an easy decision and knowing Elton, it was not a 
decision he took lightly. It was a vote against crime and for the residents of 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 I would remind Elton's supporters of one of President Reagan's favorite 
sayings; "If you agree with someone 95% of the time, he is a 95% friend, not a 
5% enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 Elton never gets to vote on a bill be supports 100%. He fought the pork and 
social programs in the crime bill, got a lot of them removed and voted his 
conscience.

VOLUNTEER MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A host of newspaper articles recently about happenings in Thousand Oaks that 
are prompted by the advent of the new Civic Arts Plaza, urges me to speak out 
against misinformation that gives rise to erroneous conclusions.  
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley Art Museum is a nonprofit corporation founded in 1978 by 
approximately 20 educators, business persons and artists, to promote the 
talents of our artists and to present to the community the contributions being 
made to the visual arts in our time.It is not city-owned, operated or supported 
in any manner by the city. It is still an organization operated by volunteers, 
headed by the volunteer president, Maria Dessornes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that the Conejo Valley Art Museum is now actively searching for a 
permanent location, but not because our city leaders or the construction of the 
Civic Arts Plaza fostered it. It is because a private collector -- a friend and 
past board member -- has promised to donate his extensive collection of art, 
valued at more than $5 million, to the museum once the museum has a permanent 
home.  
</P>
<P>
 And lastly, I do not believe that the Conejo Valley Art Museum has ever stated 
that it is "tired of having its works hidden in a corner of the Janss Mall, 
where there is little foot traffic," as you reported Aug. 14. On the contrary, 
the museum owes considerable gratitude to the Janss family for its generosity 
over the years in supporting the work of the museum and providing a rent-free 
space for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 I do hope that this will help to avoid erroneous conclusions that people might 
have because of the flurry of activity that seems to have excited some 
imaginations.

LANDING ON DEAF EARS

 I have a question for all the proponents of a civilian airport at Point Mugu 
who think Ventura County businesses will profit by such a venture: How many 
times have you stopped and made a significant purchase on your way to or from 
LAX or Burbank? I have made hundreds of trips to LAX and about 20 to Burbank in 
the more than 28 years we have lived in Camarillo, and I have yet to stop and 
purchase anything but gas. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll tell you what you will get if the airlines start using Point Mugu: more 
surface traffic, more air pollution, more surface and air congestion, and lots 
more noise.

KOCHEL QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teachers and school administrators are mandated reporters of child abuse, 
sexual molestation and neglect. The Welfare and Institutions Code requires them 
to report all suspected instances. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ventura School District officials are claiming they did not have evidence, 
then they violated the law by not reporting the case of Coach Harvey Kochel 
case when they admit they warned him. Why is the school district hiring 
teacher/coaches with predatory, macho attitudes toward students rather than 
being protective and responsible? 
</P>
<P>
 The Times in each article written on this issue has described what went on as 
"an affair," "fooling around," or a "sex scandal." When are the newspapers 
going to accept the responsibility for calling a teacher's predation of a child 
what it is, sexual abuse and exploitation?

COMPLAINT DERIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ethel Sulkis' complaint (Letter to the Editor, Aug. 16) that various forces 
have lined up to deny her the opportunity to vote for the Weldon Canyon 
Landfill ballot initiative is not only ludicrous, it completely ignores the 
truth behind the entire landfill initiative charade. 
</P>
<P>
 This initiative would actually direct the county to nullify the constitutional 
protection of many laws and agencies.In simplest terms, if the courts 
ultimately do eliminate this initiative from the November ballot, thus 
preventing Ms. Sulkis from voting on it, numerous safeguards that attempt to 
preserve a good measure of our quality of life will have been preserved.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, I can't believe that voting for this particularly 
destructive ballot initiative, and therefore obliterating these same vital 
safeguards, is what Ms. Sulkis (or anyone conned into signing the initiative) 
was aware of or even wants for the county.

THE RIGHT TO VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, the voters will be denied the opportunity to democratically decide 
an issue for themselves. Removing the Weldon Canyon issue from the ballot is a 
triumph of technical lawyering over justice, and it is symptomatic of the 
problems facing America today. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears the judge somehow felt that it was not a valid land-use issue, but 
instead was designated to further the economic goals of a private business. 
Well, as an elected council member and mayor, I've been voting on land-use 
decisions now for 15 years. Virtually all of the requests are based on economic 
reasons. The proponent of a proposed land use wants to make better economic 
return. That's the way a free enterprise economy works. Opponents feel that the 
use directly impacts the desirability of their neighborhood, may negatively 
impact the overall community, or even degrade their quality of life. All of 
this impacts the livability of an area, and thus the value of their property. 
</P>
<P>
 All sides to these issues have legitimate concerns, and it is the purpose of 
government to balance these two competing positions. Land-use planning by the 
ballot box is a routine occurrence. Just recently, the voters of Simi Valley 
rejected a discount retailer next to our regional mall site. The referendum has 
been an important tool used by the voters to maintain a community perspective 
on projects. 
</P>
<P>
 My main concern on this issue is not the correctness of the proposed land use, 
the intent of the proponents, or even the goals of the opponents. I am 
concerned about the laws that put the judiciary into the untenable position of 
having to interfere with the rights of the people to vote. In past cases the 
courts have shown remarkable restraint in refusing to intervene except in the 
most flagrant of violations. Gray areas and minor technicalities were left to 
the voters to sort out. Now we see cases where legal minutia are being used to 
remove propositions and candidates from the ballot. This is just more law and 
less justice, a worrying trend. 
</P>
<P>
 It just isn't fair to the judges. The Legislature must change the election 
laws so that the courts are forced to decide pre-election legal challenges only 
where based on clear, objective grounds. The more complicated technical 
challenges and constitutional issues can be held after the public has had its 
say.

THANKS TO BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An article on Aug. 1 regarding the Ventura County Symphony Assn.'s recent 
deficit stated that the Discovery Artists concert "lack(ed) a major sponsor." 
Not true.The Bank of A. Levy generously contributed a grant of $10,000 to 
support the concert. That contribution, plus the $4,000 in ticket sales, 
allowed the event to lose only $15,000. Without the bank's support, the concert 
would not have been considered. 
</P>
<P>
 We're proud of the support we've received from the Bank of A. Levy and the 
Achille Levy Foundation over the past years. We're going to miss them 
tremendously. We offer our sincere thanks to the Bank of A. Levy, Marshall 
Milligan, president, for making this inaugural Discovery Artists concert 
possible.

SIMI VALLEY SCHOOL BOARD WILL RECONSIDER FEE FOR BUS PASSES; EDUCATION: ONLY 
300 OF THE $300-A-YEAR PASSES HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY TUESDAY. BOARD DEBATES 
WHETHER TO LOWER THE CHARGE. 
</P>

<P>
 Two days before the start of school, the Simi Valley school board decided 
Tuesday to reconsider its decision to charge families up to $300 a student for 
busing. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to an outcry by angry parents, many of whom had decided not to buy 
the yearly student bus passes, the board of the Simi Valley Unified School 
District brought back the issue for further discussion.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think this board acted prematurely by instating the fees," said board 
member Debbie Sandland, to loud applause from an audience of nearly 100 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Sandland cast the lone opposing vote in the board's 4-1 decision to 
charge parents for bus transportation. The move was an effort to save the 
district about $190,000 this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members were debating late Tuesday whether to lower the fees or pursue 
other alternatives to charging parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Collins recommended reducing the charges for one semester to give the 
board time to study other options. "I have wrestled with this for the last few 
days -- my heart really goes out to the parents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have projected that ridership would decline 60% this school 
year, compared to last year. The district had hoped about 925 students would 
ride the bus this year, but only about 300 passes had been purchased by Tuesday 
afternoon, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is lower than anticipated," Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said. "I felt that 
there would be considerable falloff at the beginning of the year. . . . 
However, I don't expect we will reach the anticipated figure by the first day 
of school." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Diane Collins and Sandland urged the board to overturn its June 
decision, saying the financial burden was too much for parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I for one would like to rescind that action," Sandland said Tuesday before 
the meeting. "I say we have discussed it -- what is left to be discussed?" 
</P>
<P>
 But in a letter to Wolford sent Tuesday, Simi Valley resident Don Otto alleged 
that Sandland's push to rescind the transportation fee represents a conflict of 
interest. Sandland, the only school board member with a child attending school 
in the district, would benefit if officials decide not to charge the fee, 
Otto's letter charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandland called the allegation "absurd and asinine. . . . That is not the 
reason I am against home-to-school bus fees." 
</P>
<P>
 In opposing the fees, Sandland has argued that it is unfair to ask parents to 
pay for school busing during hard economic times, particularly in the wake of 
the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simi Valley parents cannot afford to pay that kind of money, so that puts our 
children on the street," grandparent Pat Joyner told the board Tuesday. "We 
have our dollars stretched as far as they will go." 
</P>
<P>
 Placing his 4-year-old son, Joey, on the speaker's podium, Benjamin Sikkens 
said he worried about Joey walking across busy Simi Valley streets when he 
starts kindergarten next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern sits right here," Sikkens said. "He deserves free busing." 
</P>
<P>
 At the district's transportation office Tuesday afternoon, parent Martha 
Ponticelli filled out forms for low-income residents seeking exemptions from 
the bus fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am divorced, I have two children, I don't have work right now," she said. 
"It is too much." 
</P>
<P>
 The fee structure changes for families with more than one child. Parents would 
be charged $500 a year for two children, $600 for three and then $50 for each 
additional child. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Pamela Knight is also seeking assistance to help pay the $500 fee for 
her two children, who will be bused to Valley View Junior High this year.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know economically it is kind of rough," Knight said of the district's 
financial woes. "But to charge that kind of money. . . . That is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Some school board members said they had no choice but to impose the fees, 
given the district's $2.5-million deficit last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a community where the traditional yellow school bus is something they 
have come to expect at no cost," board member Doug Crosse said. "(But) we are 
almost to the bare-bones operational mode. Anything we do now is going to have 
a greater and greater impact on the classroom."

TAKING SIDES; BASEBALL GAME WOULD PIT GIRLS VERSUS BOYS CHAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the 13-year-old boys on a Thousand Oaks baseball team got all the glory 
-- and the lion's share of media coverage -- for their World Series 
championship last month, their female counterparts in Newbury Park didn't just 
get mad. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls, who had just won Bobby Sox softball's national title, vowed to get 
even. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they may get their chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents from both youth leagues have given tentative approval to a matchup 
between the Junior League boys and the 12- to 15-year-old girls. The game is 
already splitting Conejo Valley fans along gender lines even though no decision 
has been made about what kind of ball to use or which size diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our girls will win," said Joseph Joyce, president of Newbury Park's 
Bobby Sox softball league. "They play a very disciplined and strong game. Girls 
can compete very well, given the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce Singleton, president of the Thousand Oaks Little League, said the 
proposed matchup reminds him of the fate of the Silver Bullets, an all-female 
professional baseball team that got clobbered in competition with male 
minor-league baseball players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The games are totally different," Singleton said. "If we were to play these 
girls on a field with 90-foot base paths, they've never played on anything 
beyond 60 feet. And that is a world of difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Singleton paused a second, then added: "However, at that age, girls are pretty 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 While leaders from both leagues are reluctant to call it a grudge match, 
others say the game reminds them of another fabled battle of the sexes from 
years past. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be sort of a Billie Jean King-Bobby Riggs thing, wouldn't it," said 
Patrick Murphy, an Agoura Hills attorney, referring to the much-hyped 1973 
tennis match that the younger King won decisively. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's 12-year-old daughter, Jessica, played Bobby Sox softball this year 
and went all the way to the state finals, he said. Like many parents of Bobby 
Sox players, Murphy said he was incensed by the expansive coverage given the 
Junior League boys' victory in the World Series, because the reporting on the 
girls' national title was paltry by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 If the faceoff game helps raise the public's awareness about girls softball 
and brings increased coverage to the sport, he is all for it, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the purpose is to draw attention to the issue of balanced 
reporting in girls sports rather than to create more tensions among the kids," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The details of the proposed matchup are still being worked out. But Joyce said 
the game would have to be played within the next two weeks because the players 
will be busy with school and winter sports after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Angel, a deejay at KNJO radio in Westlake Village, began talking about 
the possibility of a boys-versus-girls competition after parents of softball 
players called the station to complain that the girls were being overlooked in 
sports reports, Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel called Joyce and Singleton to ask if they were interested. Both league 
presidents said they would be willing, as long as the game is played for fun 
and proceeds go to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Players from both leagues will participate on a voluntary basis, the men said. 
Joyce said besides fielding a team of older girls, he would also like the Bobby 
Sox league's younger division, for girls ages 9 through 11 years, to play the 
9- and 10-year-old Little League boys. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Joyce and Singleton are enthusiastic about the proposed match, the 
13-year-old boys Little League manager, Ed Kitchen, said he does not know how a 
game could be played fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball is played on a diamond with 90-foot base paths and the small, hard 
balls are thrown overhand by a pitcher. In softball, the game is played on a 
more compact field with a larger and softer ball that is pitched underhand, 
Kitchen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like asking ice hockey players to play street hockey," Kitchen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Kitchen said that holding up the coverage of the girls' victory 
to the boys' title is not an apples-to-apples comparison. The boys won a world 
series, beating out teams from other countries, while the girls brought home a 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 And, like it or not, there is an echelon in sports coverage, Kitchen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Northridge Little League team got 100 times more coverage than we did," 
Kitchen said, referring to the team of 12-year-olds whose Little League World 
Series title game was televised nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we got a lot more coverage than the Bobby Sox league did," he said. "That 
might change in 10 years from now, but right now that's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What about the players? Do they like the idea of a competition? 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda Marino, a 15-year-old Bobby Sox catcher, said she is excited about 
playing the boys. And she is confident about the girls' athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will probably be a close game, but I think we'll end up winning," Amanda 
said. "We will show the community that girls can beat boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Heyne, a 13-year-old right fielder, was also ready for the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls that play softball are usually pretty good," he said. "They'd be 
good competition."

2 GET PROBATION IN ABDUCTION PLOT; CRIME: TEXAS PAIR WERE FOUND GUILTY OF 
PLANNING TO KIDNAP A CAMARILLO ATTORNEY AND HOLD HIM FOR RANSOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling the crime "one of the most lunatic ventures I have seen in a long, 
long time," a judge gave probation Tuesday to two Texans who planned to abduct 
a Camarillo tax attorney and hold him for ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele placed Norman Rudy Demshar, 47, and Rose 
Marie Lovings, 35, each on five years probation for trying to abduct the lawyer 
whom they believed knew the location of millions of dollars missing in a 
federal fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele called the case bizarre, saying that the defendants traveled to Ventura 
County on an unfounded belief that attorney Russell Smith III knew the 
whereabouts of as much as $10 million from an unrelated fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
 In a quirk in state law, Steele had two options Tuesday: sentencing them to 
life in prison or placing them on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge chose probation, saying the crime was serious, but not so severe 
that it warranted a life prison term. Steele said after reading police reports, 
he expected the defendants to be hardened criminals. He said he was shocked to 
find them to be churchgoing parents with no criminal histories. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I read these reports I thought we were going to get some pretty tough 
people in here who we were going to have to have shackled," Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Steele handed out the same sentence of probation to a third defendant 
in the case, Phillip Duane Dowell, 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Demshar was the mastermind of the abduction plot, and was given a suspended 
life sentence to be served only in the event he violates probation. 
</P>
<P>
 All three defendants pleaded no contest to conspiracy to commit robbery for 
the purpose of ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they drove a rented van from Texas to Ventura County in May, 
1993, and planned to abduct Smith, who has since moved out of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim G. Gibbons, who argued that probation was too lenient 
for the defendants, said outside of court that he understood the judge's 
actions. "It's just a weird thing where a person can be sentenced only to life 
in prison or receive probation," Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Joseph Lax declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began in April, 1993, when an informant told a retired police officer 
in Texas about the plot against Smith, who was on probation after serving a 
short federal prison term in connection with a $70-million fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
 Demshar and Smith were personal friends and members of the Mormon church, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks after authorities learned of the abduction plot, the defendants 
were arrested in Oxnard after staking out Smith's home. Police found several 
handguns, gauze, tape, earplugs, rubber gloves, handcuffs and a homemade billy 
club in their possession. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The case languished in the court system for more than a year before Dowell 
entered his plea last spring and was sentenced to probation in June. Shortly 
after Dowell's plea, Demshar, of Woodlands, Tex., and Lovings, of Houston, also 
entered their pleas. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday, told authorities that 
Demshar believes he has millions of dollars from the fraud case hidden in 
secret bank accounts in the Cayman Islands, according to court records and 
Gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is a mystery to me, just as it was to Judge Steele," Gibbons 
said. "Why these guys thought they were going to get away with this, I don't 
know. It's also just pure speculation that this guy (Smith) had money."

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; MASTER OF THE RADIO BROADCAST STANDS OUT ON PAPER, 
TOO; NORMAN CORWIN'S LETTERS EDITED BY A.J. LANGGUTH ; BARRICADE BOOKS $29.95, 
467 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Norman Corwin is probably best known as the dean of the radio dramatists of 
the so-called Golden Age, a man who understood how to use the medium of 
broadcasting to create a veritable symphony of human voices. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as we discover in "Norman Corwin's Letters," Corwin's radio scripts are 
not his only handiwork. He has written poems, plays, essays and books; he 
composes word puzzles and off-color limericks. Above all, Corwin was (and is) a 
prodigious and often passionate letter-writer whose personal archives contain 
some 10,000 letters, a vast collection of correspondence that amounts to 
eyewitness testimony to a half-decade of American politics and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 So lively is Corwin's mind, so probing his curiosity, that Corwin's 
correspondence amounts to a spotlight that sweeps across the historical 
landscape and pauses now and then to illuminate some intriguing sight. As we 
read through these hundreds of letters, long and short, we see him pause on a 
poem by Robert Frost, an encounter with a future victim of the Stalinist 
purges, a scene from the Six-Day War, and a sojourn in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The first cut from Corwin's vast collection of letters was made by Corwin 
himself. A.J. (Jack) Langguth, an accomplished journalist, historian and 
biographer, made the final selection. The result is an intriguing work of 
history and biography in the form of highly intimate correspondence that spans 
more than 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipients of Corwin's letters, whose names are prominently displayed on 
the dust jacket, include many luminaries of American popular culture, ranging 
from Bette Davis and Groucho Marx to Leonard Bernstein and Orson Welles. A good 
many, however, are addressed to Corwin's various relatives -- and we are given 
only Corwin's side of the correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 The very first letter in the book is a sentimental note to his parents on the 
occasion of their 25th wedding anniversary: "Be mindful, on this day, that the 
best is yet to be! " writes the young Corwin with the pluck and good cheer that 
characterizes his personality and his politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Corwin reports on his health, his love life, his finances, even the bargains 
that he has found: "Just now bought a new silent Corona portable, which retails 
for $67.50, for $54.67." He offers up a bit of doggerel, including a 
flirtatious little poem to the actress Dorothy Maguire: "Not even I/Can 
understand why/A girl so ostensibly shy/Should wear, in full view of the public 
eye,/A dress with an open fly." 
</P>
<P>
 His otherwise high spirits tend to flag in the '50s, when so many of his 
colleagues in the media fell under the cloud of McCarthyism. Corwin is not 
merely gallant but downright courageous in offering work to Judy Holliday when 
she fell afoul of the blacklist: "I am distressed to hear that the goons are 
still at it," he wrote. "Even the Christian martyrs had a chance to kick a lion 
in the nose before being clawed by the mighty paws." 
</P>
<P>
 The letters tend toward chattiness and intimacy, especially when he is writing 
to his family. Only rarely does Corwin work himself up to the certain grandeur 
of language that is reminiscent of his radio scripts: 
</P>
<P>
 "And because Wisdom is a rare radium," he wrote in one letter, praising the 
company of the night before, "buried under tons of shale and clay and 
disintegrating granite, it is wonderful to pass through a triple concentration 
of its rays all in one evening." 
</P>
<P>
 More often, though, a wry and sometimes sly sense of humor pervades Corwin's 
correspondence, as when he banters with his editor at Simon & Schuster about 
the sexual allure of mountain goats: "Once, in a moment of passion, I cried out 
to a shapely Angora, 'Tell me you love me!' " Corwin joked. "Not a twitch from 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 His earliest letters show Corwin to be a born showman with a hunger for praise 
and applause, and yet he was also an earnest teacher who believed that he had 
something of value to say to the public. When he was still a young newspaper 
reporter, he described a speech that he had given at a local high school -- and 
he specified exactly how long the clapping lasted. 
</P>
<P>
 "My formula was merely to give them something they could understand, 
appreciate and find amusing," he wrote at the age of 24, neatly summing up a 
credo that has lasted a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of "Norman Corwin's Letters," we see that Corwin -- who has 
outlived many of his colleagues and contemporaries -- is tending to write what 
can only be described as fan letters. (Indeed, he wrote a great many such 
letters to various editors and reporters for The Times.) But even his most 
casual notes ring with Corwin's endearing charm and verve. 
</P>
<P>
 "There could be no greater symmetry between two people unless they were 
twins," Corwin wrote to Ray Bradbury in 1988, "or were named Yo Yo Ma and Yo Yo 
Pa.' 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, if Corwin is sometimes sentimental and even corny, the collected 
letters confirm that Corwin is what Langguth calls "an honest liberal." They 
also show how Corwin's stubborn belief in humankind's better nature survived 
even the worst excesses of his century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corwin has celebrated a country he found splendid in its idealism and valor," 
Langguth concludes. "We know that Norman Corwin's America exists because 
Jefferson, Lincoln, Thoreau and Whitman have lived there before him." 
</P>
<P>
 The last letter in "Norman Corwin's Letters" is dated only six months ago, and 
we must assume that Corwin, a vigorous 85, is still writing. But Langguth 
reports that Corwin has abandoned his own efforts at autobiography, and so 
"Norman Corwin's Letters" will have to serve as the definitive account of his 
life. Happily, it does.

DAUGHTER OF PIONEER VALLEY RESIDENT DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Louise Weddington Carson, the last surviving child of San Fernando Valley 
pioneer Guy Weddington, has died at a Studio City convalescent home. She was 
88. 
</P>
<P>
 A lifelong North Hollywood resident, Mrs. Carson died Sunday of complications 
of Alzheimer's disease, said her son, Guy Weddington McCreary. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Weddington was born in the home of her grandfather, Wilson C. 
Weddington, in 1905. At the time, the family owned much of what was then the 
community of Lankershim. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Mrs. Carson's recollections of her early childhood in the rural 
southeast Valley were published in "Universal City -- North Hollywood: A 
Centennial Portrait" by author Tom Link. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, Lankershim was a one-horse-shay town," she was quoted as 
saying. "We lived on a farm, and we had more fun than the people in the cities. 
. . . Nobody knows that nice, open feeling anymore. I liked that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Carson's grandfather served as Lankershim's first postmaster from 1893 to 
1915. Her father, Guy Weddington, operated the community's general store with 
his brother Fred for many years, and later served as president of the North 
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce in the late 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first marriage, to Tom McCreary, ended in divorce. She married her second 
husband, city engineer Luther B. Carson, in 1950. He died in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, the split-level, ranch-style house Carson had designed for the couple 
became immortalized as the residence of television's "Brady Bunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Carson was also recruited by Valley College in the 1980s to record her 
early memories of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really the end of an era," McCreary said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her son, Mrs. Carson is survived by a grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 A graveside service will be held at 2 p.m. Friday at Hollywood Memorial Park, 
6000 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood. J.T. Oswald Mortuary in North Hollywood is 
handling the arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to any charity benefiting 
Alzheimer's research, McCreary said.

SHELL: NOT AS BAD AS IT LOOKED; PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER 44-14 ROUT, COACH SAYS 
RAIDERS SIMPLY DIDN'T RISE TO THE 49ERS' CHALLENGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Throughout the exhibition season, the Raiders pointed to their Monday night 
season opener against San Francisco as an opportunity to show the nation that 
they were as good as their hype. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider fans could not wait until Labor Day to see their team's talents 
unleashed on the 49ers in a Super Bowl preview. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened? 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't as bad as we looked," Raider Coach Art Shell said Tuesday, in the 
wake of a 44-14 loss. "We just didn't rise to the occasion. When you play great 
teams, you have to meet the challenge. It's not that we didn't want to, but we 
just didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Against the 49ers, the Raiders were hammered in almost every area imaginable, 
suffering their worst opening-day loss since Houston beat them, 47-17, in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider defense was almost nonexistent, San Francisco rolling up 448 yards 
and 24 first downs. The 49ers scored every time they needed to as they went the 
first half without a punt, while picking up first downs on three fourth-down 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the run, the Raiders did slow Ricky Watters, limiting him to 37 yards 
in 18 carries, but quarterback Steve Young scrambled for 51 yards in five 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't dissect our football team and I won't get into any particular area," 
Shell said. "It's tough to pick out anyone or any position when you don't play 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 One area that didn't get the job done was the Raiders' pass defense. Jerry 
Rice and Young put themselves on highlight films all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Lionel Washington and Patrick Bates had their chance when they chased Rice on 
a 69-yard touchdown pass play in the first quarter. Albert Lewis and Eddie 
Anderson then had their turn in the fourth quarter when Rice set an NFL record 
with his record-setting 127th touchdown on a 38-yard catch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders could make excuses by claiming that their secondary was not at 
full strength as Washington played with an injured hamstring and Bates was 
playing only because starter Derrick Hoskins was sidelined because of a knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, would be wrong because no matter who was on the field, the 
Raiders played like a team still waiting for the season to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just seemed a little bit out of sync for whatever reason," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the Raiders struggled on defense, their offense played at an even lower 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 The running game was virtually nonexistent, 20 carries netting only 34 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't so much of what they were doing," San Francisco linebacker Ricky 
Jackson said. "It was just that we have a defense full of Pro Bowlers. It's 
like we have an all-star team out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who played with New Orleans last season, Richard Dent, Ken Norton 
Jr., Gary Plummer and Toi Cook are all new to the 49er defense, which seemed to 
catch the Raiders off guard with its aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 By staying in the rushing lanes, San Francisco's defensive front gave 
quarterback Jeff Hostetler problems by restricting his scrambling and keeping 
someone in his face for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 This tactic was effective, since the 49ers were determined not to give up deep 
passes to the Raiders' speedy receivers, Tim Brown, Alexander Wright, James 
Jett and Rocket Ismail. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see those guys running by people, you have to try and keep them in front 
of you," 49er safety Tim McDonald said. "You want to make them try and beat you 
by running routes and not just going long." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders did not help themselves by dropping some passes when the game was 
still on the line. First fullback Tom Rathman dropped a screen pass on the 
Raiders' first possession, then Wright dropped one on a deep out pattern, and 
Brown was stripped on another pass on the second drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was about as bad a game as the Raiders have played," said Brown, who 
caught five passes for 42 yards. "We didn't do enough things right. You've got 
to give them credit for taking away the deep pass." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will have a lot of work to do with a shorter than normal work week 
before playing the Seattle Seahwaks in their home opener Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that we didn't play well, but there's sunshine today . . . it's not 
the end of the world," Shell said. "We just have to do better the next time 
out, and I'm sure that we will."

EDWARDS FINDS A NICHE AMONG UCLA DEFENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donnie Edwards is the square peg that defies going into a square hole. Or a 
round hole. Or any hole. He just doesn't fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you tell him he can't. 
</P>
<P>
 He's like nobody else, and that's the way he wants it. A psychologist might 
call it a defense mechanism. Fair enough. Edwards can play some defense. 
</P>
<P>
 He's an outside linebacker at UCLA, charged with being at the right place at 
the right time. He was Saturday night at the Rose Bowl when he intercepted a 
fourth-quarter pass by Todd Helton that turned back Tennessee in the Bruins' 
season-opening 25-23 victory. It was Edwards, playing strong safety, but they 
call him a linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hybrid position," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He has had a hybrid life. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards grew up south of San Diego, in National City. He doesn't know his 
father and says he doesn't want to. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me life, and I thank him for that, but I have no respect for him," 
Edwards says. "I guess I've seen him a couple of times, but if he walked down 
the street, I wouldn't know him." 
</P>
<P>
 The house was full, with two brothers, six sisters and an occasional 
stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a diamond in the rough, a kid from the wrong side of the tracks, when 
he came to us," says George Obnesorgen, Edwards' coach at Chula Vista High. 
Beverly Edwards had decided her son should be bused the seven miles from 
National City to Chula Vista, where opportunity lay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was poor," Edwards says matter-of-factly. "Mom didn't give me any money. I 
wanted to buy candy, get clothes and stuff, but all the little kids got 
everything. The older kids got what was left over. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 12, I got a paper route. Then I worked at the Pizza Hut. I bought 
my own clothes when I was 13, 14, my own car when I was 15, because my stepdad 
told me I was old enough to pay for my own stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 What he really wanted, though, was a niche. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was kind of in and out with the gangs," Obnesorgen says. "There just 
wasn't much stability at home. His sister moved out to go to school (when 
Edwards was 12), and he became more or less a father figure for the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took a job to help the family, and he hung around with some kids here, but 
he wouldn't tell the kids about himself. He would hide his grades, because they 
thought it wasn't cool to be too smart and he had good grades. Then he would go 
home and there would be the kids on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had to put on two or three different faces. I think it was only on the 
football field that he found a stable family life." 
</P>
<P>
 Off the field, he sought a father figure of his own. His girlfriend was Joey, 
and Joey's dad showed up for occasional practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my ex-girlfriend's family, there was a lot of affection," he says. "It's 
kind of ironic that I would hug and kiss her parents and feel comfortable about 
it, but at the same time, I would feel uncomfortable doing it with my mom. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ex-girlfriend, when we broke up, it was a shock because she was the only 
one who knew me." 
</P>
<P>
 Through various relationships with others and frequent associations with 
coaches, who are often cast in the role of surrogate parent, Edwards hasn't 
changed. He still looks in the mirror for counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm independent, self-reliant," he says. "When adversity hits, most people 
call Mom and Dad. I turn inward and I try to get it accomplished, instead of 
asking somebody else for help. That's the way I've been for a long time. I'm 
pretty closed. . . . I don't let a lot of people in. Not even my mom. She's not 
really in. I guess, growing up independent like that, you tend not to trust 
people. Only my ex-girlfriend knew me." 
</P>
<P>
 No one else has been allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Edwards turned to accomplishments. The way out was education, and the 
way to education was football, but for a 200-pound linebacker, opportunities 
were limited. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State wanted him. So did Colorado State and most of the schools in 
the Western Athletic Conference. Among Pacific 10 Conference schools, only UCLA 
sought him. 
</P>
<P>
 WAC coaches pressed their bids by expounding on limitations they said would 
hamper him in the Pac-10. It was the wrong sales approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'You're too small, not strong enough,' " Edwards says. "I used it 
as a motivational tool. I decided to say, 'Watch me.' 
</P>
<P>
 "If you tell me I can't do something, it's all I need to hear. If you say, 
'Jump over that wall,' I'm going to jump over the wall. I have so much pride 
that it's coming out of my ears. If anybody else can do something, I can do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 After a redshirt season at UCLA, Edwards became a starter in the sixth game of 
his freshman season and has been ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a junior now and finds himself ahead of the academic game. He will get 
his degree in political science after the winter quarter, and plans to go to 
graduate school during his senior season. Law school is in his future, he says, 
though not the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The juris doctor is power," he says. "When you have it, you can do pretty 
much what you want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 It's football, and it's education. They are clear. Everything else is pretty 
confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 It goes back to stereotypes. He defies them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm part black, part Mexican, part Cherokee Indian, so I'm all mixed up," he 
says. "I never knew what my identity was, growing up. I was just Donnie, 
hanging out with the guys. . . .. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have dark skin, so most people think I'm black, but I'm not cultured black. 
Black members of the team have tried to teach me, but I began to think, 'There 
are so many groups. Why can't they just get together?' " 
</P>
<P>
 His faith helps, but even that is taken on his own terms. He is Rastafarian, 
with "Jah," the Rastas' term for God, on his cap bill over "Reggae," the 
Rastas' music. But some of the Rastas' beliefs collide with his Catholic 
upbringing, so his worship is a hybrid. He is trying to grow the dreadlocks 
they embrace but says he refuses to smoke the marijuana that they believe makes 
them more open to God. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ethnicity is mixed," he says. "My religion is mixed. It's all mixed up, so 
when I hang out with people, I'm just myself. I don't try to conform with 
anybody -- whites, blacks, Latinos, anybody. I'm Donnie. This is how I am."

JIM MURRAY: THIS RERUN COULD PLAY FOR USC'S ENTIRE SEASON

<P>
 Some years ago, in the course of a tight pennant race, a paper printed a story 
singing the praises of the New York Yankees' stout defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresco Thompson, vice president of the Dodgers, was unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Yankees start talking of beating you with the glove, they are in 
trouble," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, a boxing expert was noting that former champion Ezzard Charles 
was working on a new left jab for his fight with Rocky Marciano. The Rock's 
trainer, Charlie Goldman, was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ain't gonna beat no Marciano with no jab," he advised.  
</P>
<P>
 That's why a lot of us were surprised to read before the season that USC's 
hopes for a Heisman Trophy and a Rose Bowl bid resided in the strong right arm 
of quarterback Rob Johnson. As Fresco Thompson might note, when the Trojans 
start talking of beating you with the arm, they are in trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans do not go over you. They go through you. They do not jab, they 
throw the right. 
</P>
<P>
 This, after all, is the school of the Thundering Herd. This is Tailback U. 
Student Body Right. Not "Everybody out for a long one!" The Trojans punish you, 
they don't flimflam you. Passes are for Yale and Stanford, not SC and Ohio 
State.  
</P>
<P>
 Trojans are fast. But they are physical. This is not light horse cavalry 
swooping down from the hills. This is the main army smashing through where you 
are weakest.  
</P>
<P>
 It goes back to Howard Jones. The Headman. Jones disdained trickery. A pass 
was considered sissy football, a court of last resort, strategy of desperation. 
But you have to remember, in those days a passer had to be five yards behind 
the line of scrimmage. And two consecutive incomplete passes resulted in a 
penalty. And a pass incomplete in the end zone meant the ball went over to the 
other team -- on its 20-yard line.  
</P>
<P>
 The pass was so suspect to Trojan brain trusts that, as late as 1955 they were 
putting the ball in the air only 152 times all season. Last year, Rob Johnson 
alone put the ball up 449 times. Passing yardage, only 723 with two touchdowns 
in 1950, was 3,829 last year with 31 touchdowns.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1929, Howard Jones' team rolled up 492 points in 12 games, including a 
47-14 Rose Bowl victory. Now, that was herd mentality! 
</P>
<P>
 The Thundering Herd has looked more like a flock of sheep at times in its 
recent past. But in the opener Saturday, there were signs that the herd had 
only been frozen in time and was beginning to thaw back into its old mode. 
</P>
<P>
 SC was behind in the third quarter, 17-10. The Trojans had the ball on their 
30. Washington was keying on their tailback, Shawn Walters, and he had to make 
hard yardage under a canopy of purple enemy tacklers.  
</P>
<P>
 That's when Delon Washington entered the equation. It's probably as unknown as 
Delon will ever be. He blew his cover. He rolled for 12 yards, then he rocked 
for nine. Then he took off for 34. He put the Trojans on the Washington 16. Two 
plays later they were in the end zone.  
</P>
<P>
 Washington beat Washington. The Red Shirts were coming.  
</P>
<P>
 Is it, move over Marcus Allen? Get out of the way, O.J.? Look out, Pacific 10? 
Is Morley Drury reincarnated? Is Howard Jones nodding contentedly some place 
today? Is Coach John Robinson no longer Bo-Peep?  
</P>
<P>
 This Washington, Delon, that is, may be the father of his country -- Trojan 
country. One game doesn't make him Cotton Warburton or Charlie White. One game 
doesn't get you a Heisman vote.  
</P>
<P>
 Delon has a lot more on his mind than being the latest Trojan horse. He comes 
from a point in time that brought into the language some of the most dreaded 
words it can have this side of leukemia -- drive - by shooting and gang 
related. The plagues of the '90s.  
</P>
<P>
 Delon is at USC because a much-beloved older brother died in a drive-by 
shooting at a car wash in Dallas. Delon had also lost an uncle, three cousins 
and three friends to the violence of the New West that is making Tombstone and 
Dodge City look like church picnics. 
</P>
<P>
 No one ever thought of the USC backfield as a hide-out before but it was the 
place Delon's brother had always urged him to go to get as far away from the 
'hood as he could get. Was it a problem smuggling his Olympic speed, 10.3 in 
the 100, his 29 touchdowns one year at Dallas' Kimball High past the bird dogs 
for the universities of Texas, Texas A& M, Baylor and Houston? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was mad at Texas -- they didn't make me all-state," Washington says, 
grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 18, he has a lot to get even with. He doesn't see it that way, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother is with me," he says sincerely. "I'm doing what he wants, what he 
would have done." 
</P>
<P>
 He's also doing what the Trojan alumni want. The Trojans beat you with the 
foot, not the arm. The game is not armball or airball. It's football. Jones 
ball. The old-time Trojans figured if they wanted you to throw the ball, they 
would have put up a net, right?

U.S. SEEKS RESPECT, NOT CASH, AT WEMBLEY; SOCCER: AMERICANS, INSULTED BY BONUS 
OFFER, ARE HONORED TO BE THERE. ENGLISH WANT REVENGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Striding briskly up the dark ramp, which smelled faintly of the greyhounds 
that race here on other days, the coach of the U.S. national soccer team 
unclasped his hands from behind his back and raised them to the cloudy heavens 
as he entered the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like a dream," he said, twirling, taking in the 360-degree view of 
the stadium's soccer tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 In his reverence, Bora Milutinovic failed only to genuflect. After all, this 
was Wembley Stadium, soccer's cathedral, and the occasion was his team's 
arrival Tuesday evening to practice in preparation for an international match 
against England tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. players have been steeped in the lore of Wembley since they arrived 
last week, getting a crash course on the stadium's hallowed status. They got 
their first look at the north London stadium Tuesday. As they jogged on the 
putting-green field, many stole glances at the stadium's partially covered 
stands and a dark sky. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team's presence here signals its kinship with the international 
soccer family has grown less remote, a hoped-for windfall from its recent role 
as World Cup host and the team's advance beyond the tournament's first round. 
England is itself the host of the sport's next major event, the European 
Championships in 1996, and like the United States with the World Cup, the hosts 
don't have to go through qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Casting about for competition, the English invited the American team, as much 
for its value as a curiosity as for its respect as a soccer entity. Some U.S. 
players are already familiar to the English, six of them playing for 
professional teams in this country. Two -- midfielder John Harkes and 
goalkeeper Juergen Sommer -- have even played at Wembley. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other American players play elsewhere in Europe and are gaining 
reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 Respect appears to be the operative word surrounding this game. The U.S. 
players have told reporters how honored they are to be playing England -- 
Thomas Dooley said a victory over England would mean more than beating Italy or 
Brazil. And most of the players have all but drooled at the sight of Wembley, 
much less the thought of playing in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes, who is not expected to play because of a muscle strain in his left 
calf, said he would do almost anything to be able to play again in Wembley, 
this time in a U.S. uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, none of this has translated into reciprocal respect. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains a mystery just what it might take for the U.S. team, or even any 
American players, to gain the respect of English soccer pundits. The U.S. 
presence in the World Cup is explained as the gift given to the tournament 
host. England's absence from the World Cup is blamed on former national coach 
Graham Taylor, reviled as incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the matter of the $25,000. It is the amount of the "bonus" 
offered by the English Football Assn. should the U.S. win. The FA explained the 
unorthodox bonus was meant to ensure that the Americans field a competitive 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the FA's idea to put a bit of an edge to the game," FA spokesman 
David Bloomfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the reaction of the U.S. players, the offer of $25,000 might as well have 
been delivered with a slap in the face. Their incentive to win the game is now 
to stuff the money down the throats of their critics, rather than financial 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the motive, the bonus has had its intended effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an insult," said Harkes, who plays for Derby County in the English First 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes said the attitude is born of English arrogance about the game they 
brought to the world. "They don't think anyone else can play the game. They 
haven't forgotten we beat them. Never (will). This is the killer revenge game." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has beaten England. It is the most under-reported statistic 
in English newspapers this week. It happened during the U.S. Cup in June 1993, 
at Foxboro Stadium outside Boston. No one thought the United States had a 
chance. Before the game, the confident English media called the prospect that 
England might lose, "the end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team won, 2-0, which shocked the world but failed to end it. Both 
players who scored in that game -- Dooley and Alexi Lalas -- are here with this 
team, a team long on resolve but still short on international experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's game, which the United States again is not expected to win, is not for 
the money, it's for respect.

FRIDAY'S DEADLINE IS DISPUTED BY UNION OFFICIAL; BASEBALL: ORZA SAYS A 
SETTLEMENT BY SEPT. 17 WOULD STILL ALLOW TIME FOR THE SEASON TO RESUME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gene Orza, associate general counsel of the baseball players ' union, said 
Tuesday it is "patently absurd" to cancel the rest of the season, including 
playoffs and World Series, as early as Friday, a tentative deadline set by 
acting commissioner Bud Selig if there is no bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that you couldn't be playing on Sept. 24 because the season was 
canceled two weeks before that is ludicrous," Orza said on Day 26 of the 
players ' strike. "The idea that you couldn't play the World Series because the 
season had been canceled before it needed to be is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Orza said a settlement could be reached as late as Sept. 17, preserving enough 
of the season -- a week of conditioning and a week of games -- to make the 
playoffs and World Series meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the union believes that Friday is a soft deadline at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig said: "I really think Friday is the appropriate ( termination ) date, 
but we wouldn't be foolish about it if we were close to a deal. It's just that 
we're not close, and I'm not optimistic that we will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig will discuss the termination date with Donald Fehr, the union's 
executive director, again today. There are no bargaining sessions scheduled 
through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The union filed a grievance with the National Labor Relations Board, 
charging owners with unfair labor practice in refusing to make a $7.8-million 
pension and welfare payment due on Aug. 1 from All-Star game receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig said the owners were no longer obligated because the pension agreement 
had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter could ultimately be decided by an administrative law judge if the 
NLRB agrees with the union's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Selig continued to insist that not one club has suggested altering the 
salary-cap proposal, denying a rumor that the high-revenue clubs would be 
willing to dissolve the link between a salary cap and increased sharing with 
the small markets if it produced a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Informal contacts -- "the only thing we have going right now," one club 
official said -- between the union and some owners continued. Orza said the 
"sidebar discussions" have been constructive to the point that "if we save the 
World Series it will be because of them," but the owners continue to stress the 
need for a salary cap or equivalent mechanism, preventing progress. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sources said the union may be preparing a substantive proposal that 
addresses removal of the salary cap, increased revenue sharing among the clubs 
and modifications of existing systems, such as arbitration and free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The union's executive board, made up of the 28 player representatives, will 
meet in New York on Monday and Tuesday.

SWIMMING / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; VAN ALMSICK AND DOLAN SET RECORDS AS CHINESE 
SETTLE FOR SILVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two world records were set on the second day of swimming's World 
Championships, and because neither was by a Chinese woman, the water in the 
Foro Italico pool seemed a lot calmer Tuesday than it had the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean the Chinese disappeared. They added two silver medals to the 
three golds and a silver they had won Monday and have already equaled their 
medal total in the 1991 World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least for one day, they were in the shadows of Germany's Franziska van 
Almsick and the United States' Tom Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolan, a part-time disc jockey when he is not swimming or studying at the 
University of Michigan, swam the 400-meter individual medley in 4 minutes 12.30 
seconds, beating the previous record of 4:12.36 set two years ago by Hungary's 
Tamas Darnyi. Considering the four-time world and Olympic champion Darnyi's 
stature, eclipsing one of his records is impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some grander description, however, is required for van Almsick's 200-meter 
freestyle time of 1:56.78. Perhaps already, at 16, the richest swimmer in the 
sport's history, she now has proven herself one of the fastest, beating German 
Heike Friedrich's eight-year-old record of 1:57.55 by more than three-quarters 
of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 After reporters had interrogated China's Le Jingyi, when she broke the 
100-meter freestyle record Monday by almost a half-second, about alleged drug 
use among her country's athletes, it was only fair that they should ask van 
Almsick about her training regimen. But although the questions were asked, they 
did not have the same zing.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, as Chinese officials often suggest, that was the result of cultural 
bias by the primarily Western reporters who cover swimming. Or perhaps it was 
because they were more interested in discovering the details of a day that is 
bound to remain memorable for van Almsick.  
</P>
<P>
 Tired after winning bronze and silver medals Monday night in the 100 freestyle 
and the 800-meter relay, van Almsick tried to conserve energy in the 200 
freestyle preliminaries little more than 12 hours later. She conserved too 
much. Although she was second in her heat, her time of 2:01.55 was the 
ninth-fastest overall. Only eight advance to the final. 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth qualifier, however, was van Almsick's teammate, Dagmar Hase. Their 
coaches met after the preliminaries and, recognizing that van Almsick had a 
better chance to win a medal, agreed that van Almsick should replace Hase in 
the final. Still, van Almsick had to be convinced that she was doing the right 
thing.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it was her desire to erase any doubt that propelled her to the world 
record. Just as likely, it was the competition from China's Lu Bin, whose 
second-place time of 1:56.89 also beat the previous world record. Costa Rica's 
Claudia Poll finished third in 1:57.61. Far behind in fourth and fifth were the 
United States' Cristina Teuscher in 2:00.18 and Olympic champion Nicole 
Haislett in 2:00.30. 
</P>
<P>
 There was speculation within the German media that Hase was paid to step 
aside, which van Almsick vigorously denied. But if it were true, she would 
never miss the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Already a star in Germany after winning four Olympic medals at 14 two years 
ago in the Barcelona Games, van Almsick's popularity reached heights previously 
reserved only for Steffi Graf by winning seven more -- six golds -- in last 
year's European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Photogenic, personable and, according to Der Spiegel magazine, the first 
successful athlete in half a century to be embraced by all of Germany -- not 
just the East or the West -- she has signed sponsorship deals reportedly worth 
$10 million over four years. For one with a Swiss chocolate manufacturer, she 
replaced super model Claudia Schiffer as spokeswoman.  
</P>
<P>
 Van Almsick's mother was an East Berlin speedskating and rhythmic gymnastics 
coach who has been exposed as a former informer for the government's secret 
police, the Stasi. Among East Germans, that is hardly a unique distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 But van Almsick was barely touched by the fall of the Berlin Wall, which 
occurred when she was 11. She recalls that day primarily because she was able 
to walk into West Berlin for ice cream. Her special sports school closed, but 
she has continued to train with her coach. Their first separation will occur 
this fall. Van Almsick plans to attend high school in Coral Gables, Fla., for 
three months so that she can improve her English. 
</P>
<P>
 The other world record-setter Tuesday was not even the most famous individual 
medley swimmer in his home pool at Ann Arbor, Mich. That distinction belongs to 
Eric Namesnik, who finished second to Darnyi in the 400 IM at the 1991 World 
Championships and 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone seemed likely to beat Darnyi's record, it was Namesnik. But he was 
no match for Dolan, finishing third in 4:15.69. Finland's Jani Sievinen was 
second in 4:13.29. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolan qualified for the U.S. team in last month's national championships at 
Indianapolis despite an asthma attack that forced him into the hospital for 
observation. 
</P>
<P>
 A more apparent, but less distressing, physical problem in Indianapolis was a 
goatee that was not the same color as the hair on his head because they were 
touched by differing amounts of chlorine and sun. 
</P>
<P>
 When he shaved and tapered for this meet, the first thing to go was the 
goatee. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell the truth, I got kind of sick of it," he said. "So did my parents."

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; MCCALLUM HAS KNEE SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Running back Napoleon McCallum was expected to be sidelined for the season 
after surgery to replace a ruptured artery in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum was injured early in third quarter of the Raiders' 44-14 loss to the 
San Francisco 49ers on Monday night when he severely hyperextended his knee 
while being tackled by Ken Norton Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum, who was down on the field for about seven minutes, was carried off 
on a stretcher after evoking images of the broken leg Washington quarterback 
Joe Theismann suffered when he was tackled by New York Giant linebacker 
Lawrence Taylor on a Monday night telecast in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "His foot got caught up under a tackler," Coach Art Shell said Tuesday of 
McCallum, who also suffered ligament damage of an undetermined severity. "He 
broke a blood vessel. The surgery came out fine and he's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum, who rushed for five yards in three carries, had scored the Raiders' 
second touchdown of the game to cut their deficit to 20-14. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disheartening because Napoleon is well loved by everyone on the football 
team," Shell said. "He's a guy who has just worked so hard. Hopefully, he gets 
healthy as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other than McCallum's injury, the Raiders walked away from Monday's game 
without any other major injuries. Safety Derrick Hoskins, who was replaced by 
Patrick Bates in the starting lineup after suffering a knee injury in the final 
exhibition game at Houston, will practice this week and is expected to play 
Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made the decision on Sunday to hold Hoskins," Shell said. "I'd didn't want 
him out there for a whole game. So, I gave him an extra week to get healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Greg Biekert and Bates gained their first NFL starts against the 
49ers and Shell said both played well at times. Biekert, who was replaced by 
No. 1 draft choice Rob Fredrickson in the second half, had a first-half 
interception off a deflection by Terry McDaniel and finished with two tackles. 
Bates, who was a step slow on a first-quarter Jerry Rice touchdown pass play, 
had five unassisted tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the 49ers had at least six runs of more than 10 yards and finished with 
156 yards rushing, the Raiders' longest run was seven yards by Tom Rathman. 
</P>
<P>
 A major concern for Shell? 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't run the ball well and that's obvious," Shell said. "But, I'm 
concerned about our whole football team, not just one area. We lost a big 
game." LONNIE WHITE

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; KINCHEN RELEASED; HENLEY TO SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams released wide receiver Todd Kinchen to make room for cornerback 
Darryl Henley on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley reported to Rams Park, met with Coach Chuck Knox, but left without 
signing a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect it to be done," said John Shaw, Ram president. "We're just waiting 
for some documents detailing the financial terms (of Henley's $2-million 
bail)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were told they would have those documents at noon Tuesday, but 
Henley's agent, Marvin Demoff, had not delivered the paper work by the end of 
the business day. The team would like to have Henley signed today to practice 
in preparation for Sunday's game against the Falcons at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley has been indicted for cocaine possession and distribution and awaits a 
January trial. However, he has received permission from the NFL to play, and a 
federal judge ruled he can travel with the team if he, or a responsible third 
party, secures a $2-million bond.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kinchen, the team's No. 3 draft pick in 1992, has undergone surgery on both 
knees in the last year and has been battling back from a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Team trainers cleared him to start practicing today, but his $375,000 salary 
became a tradeoff for the $350,000 the Rams are expected to pay Henley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a numbers situation," Knox said. "While we think he's an outstanding 
talent, we had a hard time keeping him on the field." T.J. SIMERS

WELL WORTH HER WEIGHT; ROSIE CADMAN HAS THE ONLY OFFICIAL SCALE IN THE TOWN OF 
AVALON, AND HER HEART IS AS BIG AS SOME OF THE MARLIN AND OTHER FISH SHE HAS 
HOISTED IN MORE THAN 30 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Rosie Cadman had hoisted much bigger critters onto the scale at the end of the 
pier, but none so precious as the one she weighed on a recent warm and breezy 
morning, long before the tourists had flocked to the beaches to soak up the 
Catalina sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 Megan Marie Fullmer, born Aug. 11 at 4:30 a.m., tipped Rosie's scale at 7 
pounds 9 ounces and measured 20 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rosie, it was grandchild No. 9, all provided by her 35-year-old daughter, 
Janet Fullmer, one of four of Rosie's children still living on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Janet) squirts them out like little melon seeds," says Kay Spurgeon, an 
Avalon resident and longtime friend, stopping by the pier to congratulate 
Rosie. "She doesn't even go to the hospital anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 There are so many of the Cadman clan running around Avalon, it would be hard 
to walk a city block without bumping into one of them. But then there are only 
so many city blocks, Avalon proper covering only one square mile. The permanent 
population is 2,700. And all of them know Rosie Cadman, who has been weighing 
and selling fish here for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosie Cadman, a petite, salt-and-pepper haired, energetic 69-year-old, is 
known around town -- and on the mainland, for that matter -- for more than her 
ability to operate a scale. Practically everyone she meets becomes an immediate 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catalina Islander, one of a few newspapers on the island, once dubbed 
Rosie "the Grand Dame of Pleasure Pier," saying she had "the largest heart of 
anybody in Avalon." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Macklin, 45, a Newport Beach fisherman and member of Avalon's prestigious 
Tuna Club, says: "Rosie knows everybody on the island by their first name and 
they all know her. Rosie's always there for you, which is really nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Nice, because Rosie operates the only official scale in town, which every year 
puts her in contact with hundreds of fishermen who ply the productive waters 
around Catalina. Many of them belong to clubs, either here or on the mainland, 
and all rely on Rosie to weigh and record their catches. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rosie rarely lets them down. She can be found at the end of the pier from 
sunrise to sunset, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The green pier and Rosie go together," says Robbie Ford, 44, a longtime 
family friend visiting for the summer. "Everybody knows it. All the old 
fishermen that come here every year -- they want to see Rosie." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosie came to Catalina with her husband, Earl, in 1946, and they have lived 
here since, Earl working first as a fisherman and then with the Harbor 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, the couple took over Avalon Seafood at the end of Pleasure Pier and, 
as a courtesy to the city, claimed the title of official weighmasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Cadman, 77, retired years ago, but Rosie still walks out to the end of 
the pier every morning, and with the help of a few of her grandchildren -- she 
has five working for her -- and two sons, she opens the restaurant and prepares 
for her visitors, many of them friends who walk out to the pier every day to 
check on Rosie. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if we don't see them, we call and check on them, " Rosie says. "I get 
worried if I don't see them. I really do." 
</P>
<P>
 The pier is indeed a busy place during the summer, with people strolling out 
to book trips aboard the glass-bottomed boat or merely for some of Rosie's fish 
and chips. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the cannon sounds, the pier becomes a madhouse. People march to 
Rosie's like an army of ants. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the cannon goes off, we know it's either a marlin or a murder," says 
Roger Cadman, 45, one of Rosie's sons. 
</P>
<P>
 When Macklin brought in the season's first marlin on July 31, he found himself 
surrounded by a virtual sea of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't count them all," he recalls. "There were hundreds. They had the 
place roped off." 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle was Rosie, who still lowers the pulley to the boat, ties the 
billfish by the tail, tapes its mouth shut, hoists it up and over the rail, and 
displays it in front of her restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 She usually lets some of the more curious children guess the weight of the 
fish before putting it on the scale. She then ventures a guess herself. And 
more often than not, Rosie wins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sugar, you get lucky sometimes," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck has nothing to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosie has seen more marlin than most of the old men of the sea.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know in my mind I've weighed over 5,000 marlin," she says, sipping a 
lemonade outside her restaurant, waving at friends as they pass by. "The most I 
weighed in a season was 320 and the least I weighed was 27. That was an easy 
summer, that 27." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest Rosie has had to deal with was a 339-pound striped marlin -- still 
a state record -- caught by Gary Jasper in 1985. The fish is mounted on a wall 
inside Catalina's waterfront museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, a 700-pound blue marlin was brought to the pier, but Rosie was 
on a rare trip to the mainland because of a medical emergency and her two sons 
were also away, leaving no one capable of operating the hoist and scale. 
</P>
<P>
 The fisherman had to haul the marlin to the mainland to have it weighed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so upset we missed that fish," Rosie says, shaking her head. 
</P>
<P>
 But she hasn't missed many. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosie weighs everything from sea bass to swordfish. There is only one fish she 
refuses to haul onto the pier, the one wearing a gray suit and flashing a 
dangerous smile: the shark. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would see that thing hanging there and start screaming, 'Where's my 
baby?' " Rosie says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosie remembers an incident several year ago involving a great white shark and 
a city official.  
</P>
<P>
 "They drug it 10 miles and had shot it several times and brought it here and 
wanted to hoist it up," Rosie says of the shark. "I said, 'No way.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But the city official said, 'Go ahead, hoist it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The fish was winched over the rail of the pier and hung high for everyone to 
see, its teeth seemingly biting into the wooden slats of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 People were in awe of the beast, but there was concern as well. The city was 
deluged with inquiries regarding the safety of the beaches.  
</P>
<P>
 There has been no such excitement at the scales this summer, as marlin season 
has been slow to take off. Only a few dozen marlin and a couple of swordfish 
have been brought to the scales. 
</P>
<P>
 And as far as Rosie is concerned, only one day really stands out, the day she 
weighed in a little melon seed named Megan Marie.

 The Times' lineman of the year, Tony Gonzalez, led Huntington Beach to its 
first Southern Section title game since 1935, but the Oilers lost to Los 
Alamitos, 39-21. Gonzalez led the Oilers in touchdowns, tackles and receptions, 
and he earned a scholarship to play football and basketball at California. 
Edison finished second in league, losing, 10-7, to Huntington Beach in the 
league opener. The Chargers got a boost when running back Michael Graham 
transferred from Mater Dei at midseason, but Los Alamitos eliminated Edison in 
the Division II quarterfinals, 34-8. Fountain Valley finished third in league 
and narrowly lost to Huntington Beach, 14-10. The Barons were also eliminated 
by Los Alamitos, 42-21, in the playoff semifinals. Although Fountain Valley 
boasted future Division I college players quarterback Scott Bertoni (Nevada) 
and offensive lineman Ken Foersch (Fresno State), Edison defeated Fountain 
Valley, 27-14, to win the victory bell game. Graham rushed for 189 yards and 
two touchdowns in a matchup marred by a postgame melee. With an offense led by 
quarterback Travis Anderson and a defense led by safety Tom Keim, Marina 
finished fourth in the league by defeating Ocean View, Santa Ana, Servite and 
Westminster.

 After a first-round exit from the Division II playoffs last season, a strong 
core of returners makes the Aztecs a title contender in the tough Sunset 
League. All-league cornerbacks Clark and Hector return in the secondary and 
Jalandoni, an all-league linebacker, was the team's fourth-leading tackler last 
season. Bryant returns on the defensive line after starting as a sophomore. 
All-league running back Footman, who rushed for 721 yards, and quarterback 
Stretch, a part-time starter, will be key offensive players. Lopez, a college 
prospect at 6 feet 3, 275 pounds, anchors the offensive line. SCHEDULE

DIGEST: THOUSAND OAKS RUNNERS TO TRAVEL TO TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks High, the No. 2-ranked boys' team in The Harrier magazine's 
national preseason poll, is expected to meet top-ranked Kingwood, Tex., in the 
Southwestern University Invitational in Georgetown, Tex., on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jack Farrell, who guided the Lancers to the State Division I title and a 
No. 3 national ranking last year, decided to make the trek to Texas after 
learning that Kingwood is ranked ahead of Thousand Oaks in the preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids just want a shot at them," Farrell said. "If they're better than us, 
and they beat us in that meet, then fine. But we just want a chance to run 
against them and see how we stack up. . . . I'd hate to see us finish second in 
the national rankings because we started out the season behind them and never 
raced." 
</P>
<P>
 Five of Thousand Oaks' top seven runners return from last year's team, led by 
seniors Jeff Fischer and Kevin Marsden, who finished third and fifth, 
respectively, in the State championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingwood will be led by senior twins Brad and Brent Hauser and junior Lewis 
Jones. The trio finished 1-2-3 in last year's Texas State 5-A Division 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Fairley, who guided Palmdale High to a sixth-place finish in last year's 
State Division I boys' championships, has moved to Folsom and is teaching 
science at Oak Ridge High in El Dorado Hills and El Dorado High in Placerville. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairley, 36, has continued to fax workouts to members of the Palmdale High 
team, but he expects the school to name a replacement for him soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairley was Palmdale's boys' cross-country coach for the past eight seasons 
and the boys' track coach for the last four. 
</P>
<P>
 He guided the Falcons to the Golden League cross-country championship in 1992 
and '93 and to the track title in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Turner, the boys' cross-country and track coach at Oxnard High for the 
past six years, has been hired as the men's and women's cross-country coach at 
Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, 32, replaces Steve Hawkins as men's coach and Hector Nieves as women's 
coach. Turner's wife, Melissa, the girls' cross-country and track coach at 
Oxnard High for the past five seasons, will be his assistant at Cal Lutheran. 
Football  
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin and defensive tackle Oscar 
Wilson have been chosen to the Division I-AA preseason All-American team by 
College Football Preview Magazine. O'Laughlin, a 6-foot-3 senior, was honorable 
mention last season in the American West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, 6-3, 282 pounds, was a second-team all-conference choice who had eight 
sacks last season. The Matadors open the 1994 season Saturday at Boise State. 
Soccer  
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge men's soccer team defeated Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
3-0, and Gonzaga, 2-1, in its opening matches over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Rosenberg, taking over the forward spot vacated by former Matador 
All-American Armando Valdivia, scored two goals against Dominguez Hills on 
Saturday. Mathew Davis added the other goal and assisted on Rosenberg's scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Against surprisingly tough Gonzaga on Monday, a goal by Steven Faggiolly in 
the 81st minute broke a 1-1 tie. Mustapha Sesay also scored for Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors play Loyola Marymount in a nonconference match at North Campus 
Stadium on Sunday at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Janho scored 28 minutes into overtime, lifting The Master's to a 2-1 
victory over Southern California College in its season opener at Costa Mesa. 
Paul Smith scored Master's first goal early in the first half.

A RANGE OF DEBATE; THE SCENIC SLOPES OF MT. SHASTA HAVE SPARKED A BATTLE AMONG 
RESIDENTS WHO COUNT ON IT TO FEED THEIR BODIES AND SOULS; WHEN I FIRST CAUGHT 
SIGHT OF SHASTA, I WAS 50 MILES AWAY AND AFOOT, ALONE AND WEARY. YET MY BLOOD 
TURNED TO WINE, AND I HAVE NOT BEEN WEARY SINCE. -- JOHN MUIR, 1874

<P>
 Mt. Shasta is a wonderland of sounds: the wind refreshing the pine and cedar 
trees and a particularly sweet, palpable silence. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Native American women are cloistered in the shifting quiet, 
pondering a move to higher ground. But a Shasta nation medicine woman asks them 
to stay put at a low-elevation campground. She treks higher only on spirit 
quests, she says, and has stood at tree line only seven times. "To look upon 
our creator," Mary Carpelan says, "one stands at a distance." 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Gomes, a Wintu Shasta member, raises her arms as if to encompass the 
trees, the wildflowers, the distant ranges. "This is our church, all of it," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The women have gathered on a midsummer's day to discuss the campaign to list 
Mt. Shasta on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its 
religious and cultural value to Native Americans. The Keeper of the Register 
granted eligibility status to the mountain in March, and opponents of the 
designation have geared up for a fight before the decision becomes final. 
</P>
<P>
 An avalanche that wrecked a ski park in 1978 was Shasta's answer to insult, 
the women say. The federal designation would ensure that a worse desecration 
never comes to pass: a proposed 1,690-acre ski resort at Shasta's upper 
reaches, bringing parking lots and sewage systems as well as a payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The women believe the quiescent volcano is already aggrieved and angered. "I 
don't think anybody would appreciate putting an outhouse on an altar," Carpelan 
says. "If they continue, she's gonna blow." 
</P>
<P>
 Shasta, a 14,162-foot, double-cone volcano near the Oregon border, is the 
dominant landmark of Northern California. It rises like a lonely sentinel at 
the southern brink of the Cascades, the youngest link in the Ring of Fire that 
includes Mt. St. Helens. Religious traditions spanning ageless Native American 
to upstart New Age consider Shasta holy. Environmentalists honor it as a 
wilderness shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mt. Shasta is one of the sacred mountains of the world, similar to Mt. Fuji, 
the Himalayas, Kilimanjaro," says Mt. Shasta City resident Michelle 
Berditchevsky. "People come here and they feel something special. Sometimes 
they can't put their finger on what it is or what to call it because our 
society doesn't have names for those things, it doesn't recognize that some 
things are sacred." 
</P>
<P>
 Shasta is also arguably the most awesome peak within strolling distance of a 
major interstate. Highway 5 makes it an easy excursion for pilgrims, and they 
have come. Tourists, developers, lawsuits and the Department of Corrections -- 
civilization itself -- have come as well. 
</P>
<P>
 A state proposal to build a prison near Weed, nine miles up the road in 
Siskiyou County, has combined with the historic district debate to hone a vague 
sense of discord among townspeople already divided by culture, generation and 
class. The old-timers have shrunk to a minority, supplanted by urban refugees 
and New Agers. Galleries and upscale restaurants are the beachheads of a slow 
gentrification. As the logging economy withers, visions for the future diverge. 
Suspended in this gulf is the question of what the mountain is for. 
</P>
<P>
 Even preservationists recognize that Shasta is what draws visitors to this 
tourism-dependent town. But they believe that vigorous, ecologically sound 
businesses can be built around an intact mountain. The more traditional bloc 
worries that if the environmentalists and Native Americans gain more ground, 
their stranglehold will ensure economic despair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that this place is about creating a certain quality of life that 
has been paved over elsewhere," says Berditchevsky, a former L.A. college 
teacher who coordinates the Save Mt. Shasta citizen's group. "Rivers, meadows, 
mountains are useful, but they are also an expression of the Earth as a living 
being." 
</P>
<P>
 She and others envision a community of small businesses that enhance rather 
than corrupt the area's beauty. The town should put its energy into the arts, 
healing and retreat facilities. Already, there are plans for a Mt. Shasta 
Health Consortium and a botanical "theme park" that would refine visitors' 
understanding of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we go toward quality of life and healing and local ownership, we will 
really have something unique," Berditchevsky says. "If we gear our efforts 
toward skiing and prisons, we'll be just like anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Jerry White leads the charge to overturn the mountain's 
listing. Sifting through a stack of documents and building his argument as a 
lawyer might, he says the Keeper's decision was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 He launches a litany of criticism: It violates the separation of church and 
state. It relies upon suspect assertions of the Native Americans' historical 
use. It abuses the rights of private property owners in the designated area. 
And above all, the mountain "belongs to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 White, who has been known to wear cowboy hats and Texas-size belt buckles, 
shoots from the hip. He calls the campaign behind the historic district an 
"environmentalist land grab" achieved by "consensual manipulation" of the 
Native Americans. With the two groups allied, where will it end? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a power device to control all of the federal lands in the U.S.," he 
says. "What isn't sacred to Native Americans? How about Yellowstone, how about 
the Grand Canyon? Let's say I would like to have Mt. Eddy or the Marble 
Mountains as my church. Would you give it to me?" 
</P>
<P>
 White worked as an engineer and planning commissioner in Santa Cruz County 
before moving to Mt. Shasta in 1990 and knows the territory where politics and 
the environment meet. He sees his calling as defending the rights of the 
loggers and "sons of the pioneers," the townsfolk innocent to the ways of 
lawsuit-crazed urban America. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of what they had is gone, he says, done in largely by environmental 
laws. Young residents have no prospects to keep them here. If the historic 
district is established, he says, dwindling tourism would deal another blow to 
the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're closing the gate," he says of the newcomers and environmentalists. 
"Basically, they will shut the mountain down. There is a significant effort to 
make Siskiyou County a wilderness museum." 
</P>
<P>
 He's had enough of it. So too have fellow members of the newly formed Enraged 
Natives Opposed to Underhanded Government Hanky-panky (ENOUGH). They want 
property rights respected, they want their entitlement to public lands. And 
they want their mountain back. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Thom, a Kuruk elder, tells a story about the contested mountain, about 
sitting in the sacred Panther Meadows and being "volunteered" to do battle in 
Washington, D.C., and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The mountain started shaking, he recalls. "Then Coyote comes, he runs on past 
me up the hill, as if saying, 'Come on, let's go up the hill.' I followed 
Coyote up that hill, and I've been with Coyote ever since. Coyote turned me 
loose 19 years ago to protect this mountain." 
</P>
<P>
 Panther Meadows, its golden-green slope giving way to a view of Mt. Lassen, is 
adjacent to the proposed ski resort site. 
</P>
<P>
 Thom's husky voice adds raucous verse to the soft percussion of a subterranean 
spring. "You can't put a multimillion-dollar project up here and shave all 
these trees like my whiskers, and bring alcohol up this mountain and 
prostitution. It ain't right. Look at Aspen, Colo. They chased all the poor 
people out of there and the wealth came in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure the designation of Mt. Shasta is gonna stick because you can't 
overrule the spirit law of the mountain. You can't overrule nature's law." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Long ago, the Great Spirit created the mountain we know as Shasta by bringing 
down snow and ice from the skies and turning a vast stone round and round. He 
made it a wigwam for his home and built a fire at its center for his comfort, 
and from there he made the animals, the land and the seas. During a fierce 
storm he sent his most beautiful daughter to the summit to appeal to the winds 
for gentleness, but she was blown tumbling down the slope. A wizened mother 
grizzly took the child in and reared her, and she married the old mother's 
eldest son. They were very happy and had many children. These were the first 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 As the most prominent features of the natural landscape, their broad mass 
jutting skyward, mountains have long been seen as a channel to heaven, the 
divine, another world. The gods lived on Olympus, Moses received knowledge on 
Sinai. Many legends surround Shasta -- a conglomerate of empires is hidden 
within. Many people come to simply be near it. The mountain is a teacher, they 
say. Its energy helps people understand their role in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowena Pattee Kryder's 42 acres are reached by a gravel road rising into the 
Eddy range, about 15 miles west of Mt. Shasta City. Her dwelling is a 
California version of the outback monastery: ornate and spiritually eclectic. 
Its 12 intricately patterned sides were inspired chiefly by the zodiac. There's 
no bedroom; Kryder sleeps by the Temple of the Mother of the World, an altar 
constructed largely of rose quartz to manifest the essence of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 A sturdy, plum-cheeked woman of 58, she is a New Age priestess of sorts, as 
well as a doctor of religious studies. Her role in this life, she says, is 
teacher and visionary. What she teaches is the path to what she envisions: the 
Celestial Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Her talents are broad but of a piece. She performs rituals in the shamanic 
guise of the Egret Woman. She leads retreats to accelerate spiritual growth, 
under the aegis of her Creative Harmonics Institute. She writes books such as 
"Sacred Ground to Sacred Space." 
</P>
<P>
 Kryder moved to Shasta seven years ago, after creating a temple in Point Reyes 
and teaching sacred art and world mythology in San Francisco. "This is more of 
a visionary place, a spacious place. People come to Shasta either for a 
retreat, for healing or, in my case, for innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come here," she says, pointing to the floor, "to learn, in a kind of 
self-made training. My job is to assist and support that, because I really feel 
that if people are living who they are, the world's problems would take care of 
themselves. But that is not a small matter -- to live who you are."  
</P>
<P>
 Raised on an Indiana potato farm, Kryder's family values are strong, if you 
consider that the family is all of creation and the head of household is the 
intelligent cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been a nature mystic all my life, even as a child," she says. "It's 
been a slow process of learning who I am and what I'm supposed to do in the 
midst of a world that is very confused. Many people think I'm eccentric but in 
reality, I'm centric, I'm very centered. Sometimes you can be centered but seen 
as eccentric because they don't know how to recognize it." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Keys pursues his own vision of the universal family from his home down 
a quiet street in town. Much of his adult life had been spent leading 
organizations dedicated to peace and globalism. At the U.N., he wrote speeches 
for Secretary General U Thant and other diplomats. A prolific writer, Keys' 
books include "Earth at Omega" and "Disarmament: The Human Factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the erudite gentleman's perspective is, to say the least, cosmic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new frontier is inner and outer space, and they're both populated. Inner 
space are the dimensions we don't see with our eyes. Outer space is the 
populated universe at the physical level, including Earth.  
</P>
<P>
 "So here," he pauses, starting to smile, "we're in outer space." 
</P>
<P>
 His corner of the universe is comfortable, orderly, even generic except for 
such details as a tabletop crystal garden and a mounted photograph -- not a 
drawing, apparently -- of a flying saucer in the Swiss Alps. The caption: 
"Pleiadian Variation 4." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pleiadians are more than visitors, he explains. They are friends, if not 
saviors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have colonized Earth a number of times and they're trying to assist us 
in our civilization. A lot of them are very concerned about the current state 
of human evolution because we are right on the edge between Earth disaster or 
nuclear catastrophe and some form of transcendence. The ones who care about us 
are trying to give us a push in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Should they reveal themselves, Mt. Shasta, the cosmic portal, may play a role. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of what we might call subtle energies, Mt. Shasta is a very powerful 
place, it's like a beacon in space. In the words of an old text, a place where 
cosmic deep sounds unto cosmic deep, and that sound travels a long, long way. 
Consequently, it's a very good place to come in." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, down the interstate from Mt. Shasta City and up a chain of pitted 
logging roads, the Rainbow Family has gathered for its annual reunion.  
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the moxie to make the trip, there are no requirements to join this 
congregation. As one member famously put it: "Anybody with a belly button can 
be part of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Campsites ring a broad meadow ruled by dragonflies. The midday sun casts a 
glow onto the pristine sky. It's just another day to play in the meadow, the 
forest and the lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the play is hushed and languorous. The sound of anything as mechanical as 
a zipper would foil the "transcendental dreaming" that John Muir thought to be 
the most sensible activity in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 One bare-chested young man sits under a tree, darning his socks. He's slight 
though tautly muscled, his long dreadlocks shot through with colorful 
stick-like hairpins. Rings and pins pierce his ears, nose and lower lip. An 
upper arm is burned into a field of dotted welts, in the manner of decorative 
self-mutilation. 
</P>
<P>
 He thumbed down to the gathering from some be-in near Eugene, Ore. He's not 
altogether blissed out because rootlessness and poverty have taken their toll, 
although the alternative seems unnatural and in fact a form of bondage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not very motivated by material things," he says, gathering his dirty 
blankets into a ball. "What I'm looking for is something dealing with my mind 
and with my spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how close you want to be to God or Jah or whatever the name is, you 
can't get close to him. His expressions are all a part of nature, so to get 
closer to him you have to get closer to things that aren't man-made. A rock 
isn't man-made, a tree isn't man-made." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Everything about Rena and Frank is spic and span and in its place. The two 
retirees, who declined to give their last names, pass a lot of time on her 
front porch, watching the town change as slowly and steadily as the traffic 
goes by on Mt. Shasta Boulevard. The happily-ever-after little house was built 
in 1934 and Rena was raised in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place has grown within the last 10 years due to the fact that we have 
real estate agents here now that fed the people Down South a big line, and they 
came up here and found out it was the truth!" says Frank, who made his living 
in a lumber-treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Us old-timers, we're a minority now," he says. "Everybody else is from down 
below, been up here for five or 10 years. In the olden days you never locked 
your doors. It's not that way anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's changed a lot the last few years, changed a lot," adds Rena, a former 
waitress. "New people. You've been here for years and years, and you don't know 
anybody anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Exiles from urban California cities have become well-known although not 
necessarily well-loved in the vast, scenic territory sometimes called Superior 
California. In Shasta, the influx is accompanied by the departure and passing 
on of veteran families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The town of Mt. Shasta is divided. Cultures are cohabiting, but not too 
well," says Councilman White. "There are many people here whose history goes 
back to 1850 and there's the get-out-of-the-Bay Area group, like myself. They 
measure you by the redness of your neck, how far left or right you are." 
</P>
<P>
 The new arrivals are drawn by a combination of blessings. The mountain is the 
central fact of life here, and it is seemingly regarded by all as an object of 
beauty, if not a wonder. The other and more tangible factor is quality of life 
in Mt. Shasta City, population 3,600, located in one of the state's largest but 
least populated counties. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two stoplights and no movie theaters. There are no parking meters 
and no heavy industry, essentially no litter and no noise. Since the region 
offers few opportunities to strike it rich, the town tends to draw people of 
independent means, and nurtures artists and innovators. 
</P>
<P>
 The newcomers have widened the cultural gap between Mt. Shasta City and the 
rest of Siskiyou County. Walking down Mt. Shasta Boulevard, you'll pass Indian 
mannequins in the windows of the Black Bear Gallery and the New Life Health 
Institute, which offers chiropractic, oxegenetics and Reichian therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll pass Lily's, a restaurant that could hold its own with upscale eateries 
on L.A.'s Westside, and a charming bed-and-breakfast called the Strawberry 
Valley Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 If the urban expatriates have made an impact, so has the burgeoning spiritual 
community. Even the Chamber of Commerce makes room for them in its profile of 
the town: "Alternative religions and New Age thought draws visitors from around 
the world seeking spiritual insight." A panel judging slogans for a tourism 
campaign gave the nod to "Mt. Shasta City: Where Heaven and Earth Meet" but 
awarded a commendation for creativity to "Mt. Shasta City: Choo Choo to Woo 
Woo." 
</P>
<P>
 "The outside world is waking up to Shasta as a center, recognizing it as an 
important and powerful place," says Darlene Moss, editor of the Mt. Shasta 
Herald. The watershed event, she says, was 1987's Harmonic Convergence, which 
brought thousands here to share in a worldwide meditation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents believe the spiritual community has founded an oasis of 
generosity and respect, a model of humanity's better future. Some are appalled 
that their town is a magnet for "cults." Like any other, this subculture has 
its commercial dimension. Flyers for channelers, purifiers and retreats crowd 
bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Shasta's newer residents, religious or otherwise, tend to share a 
preservationist agenda. They say there are other ways to stay afloat besides 
bringing in a ski resort, a prison or even a Burger King.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people who moved here recently have come for the pristine 
environment," Moss says. "They are well-versed in environmental law and 
politics, EIRs (environmental impact reports) and the rest. They fought five 
years to keep Burger King out, but it finally came. So developers know that 
building in Mt. Shasta could mean five years of lawsuits." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has carried its share of the litigation burden. Recently, it raised 
sewer rates to defend against a suit over the system's expansion. With a touch 
of exaggeration, White says the tiny town's general plan has gotten so complex 
that "it would suit Sacramento. Anyone can sue a small town. All you have to do 
is keep litigation going and you can bankrupt 'em like that," he says, snapping 
his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 The backlash is gaining steam, stoked by the battle over the historic district 
on the mountain. Virtually the entire cast of elected officials in Mt. Shasta 
City and Siskiyou County, including the area's Republican congressman, are 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Keeper of the Register, Jerry Rogers, came to the hamlet for a 
town meeting and was assailed as a tyrant by hundreds of angry residents. Going 
by the book after the ordeal, he promised to take public comment for another 60 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the lawsuits and the earth-goddess worshipers, life here had a tranquil 
consistency. The mountain was wild and towered above controversy. But 
Berditchevsky sees a grim chain reaction looming, an ironic one for the area's 
tiny Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be good for the health of the community if they opened their minds 
up to new ways of doing things economically," she says. "I think that a big 
resort and the prison would be such large powers in such a small community that 
they would dominate the area. We would lose our autonomy, even the present 
power structure would be subjugated to these large interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Polarization is a new fact of life that White laments but accepts. He has a 
similar down-to-earth attitude about the scourge of civilization around the 
lofty peak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be preferable to go back to the turn of the century, when everybody 
had a lot of space. It's still such a great place to be and that's why folks 
want to close the gate and enjoy it. Unfortunately, it's just not something 
that's realistic."

 Using their personal spotlights to focus public interest on the plight of 
children in the United States, the celebrity ambassadors of the Children's 
Action Network have done a lot with a second here and a second there. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, the network's National Immunization Campaign has helped 
protect more than 175,000 children and educated millions of parents nationwide 
about the need for vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Its supporters have crusaded for better access to health care for children and 
pregnant women, and they have given children who were caught up in the 1992 Los 
Angeles riots a televised forum to air their grievances against the dangerous 
world they live in. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the nonprofit group is preparing an all-out media assault on the myth that 
no one goes hungry anymore in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to imagine that some 5 million children go hungry in this country 
every month," Winkler says, "but it's the truth and it demands our immediate 
attention." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Including his high-top sneakers and Ninja Turtle sweat shirt, 4-year-old 
Darnell Brown weighs in at a slim 34 pounds -- not bad for his height and age. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, he will probably get a blood test before preschool begins to make 
sure he has enough iron. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I going to get a shot in the butt?" he asks nurse practitioner Dolores 
Collins at the Charles Drew Head Start Medical Clinic in Compton. "Not today, 
honey, not today." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid we're seeing a fair share -- at least 10% -- of our children with 
low iron in their blood. Anemia like that means they aren't getting enough of 
the right foods," says Collins, who hands out vitamins free to families who 
need them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Drew clinic is the only preschool program of its kind with an on-site 
clinic. Because every child it serves is living below the poverty level, it was 
adopted by the children's network, which recently directed a $250,000 grant its 
way from the Mattel Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're funded to serve 1,774 children ages 3 to 5. But with the grant," says 
Martha Johnson, health coordinator, "we are able to screen and immunize another 
410 kids, the little brothers and sisters." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the children playing on the floor of the clinic waiting room don't 
recognize the names Spielberg or Winkler, but they know Big Bird and they know 
Barbie and Ken. And, after her recent appearance on behalf of the children's 
network, they know actress Demi Moore as "a nice mommy," as one child put it. 
</P>
<P>
 "With help from people who love children, we can sound the alarm for the 
specific plights of children," says Jennifer Perry, the network's executive 
director. "Once we've found the issue where our efforts might make a 
difference, we turn up the volume." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Children need a voice," actress Capshaw says. "And I can be very loud." 
</P>
<P>
 Capshaw and husband Spielberg were among the six high-profile Hollywood 
families who in 1990 founded the nonprofit Children's Action Network to exploit 
their personal fame and contacts for the good of kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us are parents and all have a solid history of work on behalf of 
children," says Winkler, whose wife, Stacey, is a founder of the Los Angeles 
Children's Services Commission. The Children's Action Network has nothing to do 
with television networks -- except for spreading the message of children in 
crisis. This is a network in the most active sense of the verb. 
</P>
<P>
 Its founders and family of friends reads like a Who's Who of Hollywood social 
activism: Norman and Lyn Lear, Edward James Olmos, "Family Ties" Gary Goldberg, 
Rhea Perlman and Danny DeVito, Robin Williams, Richard and Lili Fini Zanuck, 
Whoopi Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA President Sidney Sheinberg says his actress-wife, Lorraine Gary Sheinberg, 
and children's activist Lezlie Johnson saw an opportunity for such a coalition 
in meetings with Los Angeles children's groups years ago. "And the network 
still works best at building more coalitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not all celebrities," Sheinberg says. "It is not an exclusive club. But 
we do have access to certain people -- politicians or makers of TV programs or 
movies, people who can help us amplify the voices of children." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's highly visible -- and highly successful -- alliance with the 
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to vaccinate American 
children capitalized on the network's media access. 
</P>
<P>
 E.T. look-alikes were sent to immunization centers, Jimmy Smits and Williams 
produced public service announcements, Bugs Bunny escorted Capshaw to clinic 
openings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a similar stable of stars is being mobilized for the upcoming hunger 
campaign. And people such as Oscar Lemus at St. Joseph Center Family Assistance 
Program is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are hungry, there is no question about it," says Lemus, whose Venice 
food bank is often out of food by noon. He introduces a visitor to Reina 
Chinchilla, 30, and her 10-year-old son, Brian. "We come here every week for 
groceries, fresh vegetables, butter sometimes and cereal, when it's here. My 
boys love cereal. The food helps us very, very much." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most food banks, supplies are low in the summer and fall. "We need more 
awareness year-round that little children are not getting enough to eat, to 
grow, to learn in school. When well-known people put their spotlight on our 
work, it is a true gift," Lemus says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why people pay more attention to the voices of celebrities than to, say, those 
of children is a mystery to actress Perlman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many people out there talking about so many things, it seems 
you've got to have a gimmick to get the message across. So, hey," Perlman says, 
"we're the gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are plenty of people who may be more educated on the subject than we 
are, but people would rather go some place when one of us guys is there." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has made promotional appearances for the children's network's 
immunization campaign, she has been helped as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic change of venue for the former "Cheers" barmaid, the children's 
network recently arranged a behind-the-scenes court tour for Perlman to give 
her a taste of a real custody case drama before she dramatizes one for TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "We jump at the chance to give writers and producers resources for background 
and viewpoint for their shows," says network director Perry, whose research and 
special tours have made for more graphic and accurate depictions of issues such 
as foster care, runaways and child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to get face to face with the issues," she says. "Once you see 
a need up close, it's pretty hard not to want to do something about it."

'90S FAMILY; THE FAMILY HOUR; KIDS TAKE TO COMPUTERS LIKE FISH TO WATER. NEW 
MAGAZINES HELP TAP THAT INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In 1990, when Jake Winebaum was senior vice president of U.S. News & World 
Report and his wife was pregnant with their first child, he considered buying a 
financially troubled windsurfing magazine. He decided against it, but while he 
was throwing away some old issues, inspiration struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "A cover caught my eye of a guy windsurfing with his daughter," says Winebaum, 
34, for whom the image and headline -- "Fun" -- made a connection. "I said, 
'There's a magazine idea: family fun.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Conceiving a slick, advice-driven monthly that would offer suggestions for 
family "quality time" activities, Winebaum launched FamilyFun in 1991 using 
mostly his own money. Disney Magazine Publishing bought it after the second 
issue, but while the magazine caught on with the time-starved mothers and 
fathers of the '90s, Winebaum soon noticed the irony of a magazine about family 
leisure time often forcing him to work late. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked Disney for a computer so he could bring work home, and his daughter 
Jenna's reaction to his Macintosh Centris gave him the idea for his newest 
magazine, FamilyPC, which arrived on newsstands last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Jenna) at that time was about 20 months old. Instantly, she took to (the 
computer). She figured out with a little help from me that moving the mouse 
moved the cursor around the page," he says. "Within a day, she could basically 
navigate kids' programs." 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing friends' children perform similar feats, he decided the time was 
right for a new magazine targeting families with home computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Winebaum took his idea to Disney and computer magazinepublisher Ziff-Davis, 
which agreed to publish it as a joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
 The first issue, dated September/October, offers suggestions in plain English 
for families on choosing and using computers. The issue rates multimedia 
computer systems and color printers, evaluates educational programs and 
multimedia encyclopedias in a family testing lab, and gives practical 
instructions for such home computing activities as high-tech Halloween parties 
and electronic pen-palling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computer is this immensely powerful device that can do anything, (and) 
people are just figuring out how to harness this power for the home," says 
Winebaum, editor and publisher of FamilyPC as well as president and editor in 
chief of FamilyFun. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's multimedia-ready computers often come equipped with such features as 
fax modems and photo CD capability, Winebaum says, and many families don't take 
full advantage of those capabilities. "What do you do with a fax modem at home? 
I guarantee we will be able to come up with 10 of the coolest things to do with 
a fax at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from his magazines' editorial offices in Northampton, Mass., Winebaum 
sounds so enthusiastic it's easy to believe he might come up with seven of 
those ideas by himself. Some of the ideas in FamilyFun have grown out of 
activities Winebaum has tried with his family, says the magazine's editor, 
Alexandra Kennedy, and his family computer activities could provide similar 
fodder for FamilyPC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jenna and I did a (computer) project last week -- 'cause I do live the life," 
Winebaum says. "We had a bunch of photographs (of Jenna's introduction to her 
baby sister, Tess). I had a photo CD of them made (and) I took a program called 
'Kid's Studio,' a multimedia authoring program for 6-year-olds, and took the 
photo CDs and created a little story with Jenna that she narrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, such family projects require certain types of computer hardware and 
software, and FamilyPC provides activity ideas as well as buying guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute I told anybody at a dinner party or at work that I was working on 
this magazine, they'd pin me in the corner and say, 'Write down what computer I 
should buy,' " Winebaum says. "(It) is one of the most considered purchases." 
</P>
<P>
 Families nervous about buying the multimedia equivalent of a Betamax VCR 
certainly may need that buying advice, but Winebaum's magazine isn't the only 
one giving it. Home PC, launched earlier this year by CMP Publications, targets 
a broader audience of home computer users, and in October, Scholastic Inc. will 
reintroduce Family Computing, delivering it directly to some readers of Parent 
& Child and Home Office Computing. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the combined marketing expertise of Ziff-Davis and Disney gives 
FamilyPC plenty of clout, and Winebaum's magazine instincts are well regarded. 
"He's got a sterling track record," says Anne Russell, editor-in-chief of 
Folio, a trade publication for the magazine business. "The thing that's 
interesting about Winebaum's formula is it's participatory . . . it's for the 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Winebaum's work sometimes keeps him away from the Manhattan home he shares 
with his wife, Cindy, and their daughters. The launch of FamilyPC has forced 
him to do some extra business travel, and he usually spends at least two days a 
week in his magazines' Northampton offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the enormous time commitment involved, "it's sort of ironic to start a 
start-up magazine about families," he says by phone while driving from 
Northampton to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always juggling everything," Kennedy says. Still, "There's any number of 
times he's tearing out of the office saying, 'I've got to go home and put Jenna 
to bed.' "

'90S FAMILY; BABY BOOKS GROW UP AND MEET THE '90S; TODAY'S GUIDELINES SPEAK TO 
BOTH PARENTS. AND WHILE SOME ADVICE REMAINS THE SAME, THOSE OLD RULES ABOUT 
ALCOHOL, SMOKING AND MOMS WORKING OUTSIDE THE HOME SURE HAVE CHANGED.

<P>
 Once upon a time, before amniocentesis, ultrasound and fetal monitoring, 
pregnancy was full of uncertainties. Women listened closely to their mothers 
and doctors, and perhaps read a good baby book. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 25 years, conventional wisdom on prenatal and child care has been 
changed more times than a newborn's diaper. And, to keep up, baby books have 
grown up. 
</P>
<P>
 What was once a guide for new mothers is now a book for moms and dads, who 
both are likely to work outside the home and share child-care duties. 
</P>
<P>
 A comparison of the "Better Homes and Gardens Baby Book" from 1969 and the 
updated 1991 printing reveals some funny yet startling changes that have 
occurred since many of today's moms were babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the basic old advice holds true, such as the importance of maintaining 
a healthful diet, but much of what was permitted is now on a long list of 
no-nos. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a heavy smoker," the 1969 version says, "doctors advise that you 
cut down to a great extent, but you needn't quit entirely, unless your doctor 
recommends it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, women who smoke are warned that they run an increased risk of having an 
underweight baby. Heavy smokers increase their risk of stillbirth. Even 
exposure to secondhand smoke is seen as a threat to the unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcohol was once considered a danger only to a woman's waistline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alcoholic beverages contain between 70 and 160 calories," the old edition 
warns, "and might be worth eliminating from your diet if the doctor suggests 
cutting down on your caloric intake." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, studies have shown that babies born to alcoholic mothers commonly suffer 
from fetal alcohol syndrome. These children are undersized, have a 
characteristic facial appearance and low IQs. Moderate drinking is also thought 
to affect the unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the growing number of restrictions, the rules concerning women working 
outside the home have relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1969 version says: "Unless it is absolutely necessary for you to work, 
think it over carefully before you leave your baby in the care of someone else 
every day. He needs you!" 
</P>
<P>
 Women who worked during pregnancy were advised to stop when they began showing 
in the fifth month. And, certainly they should stop after the seventh month. 
Now, many doctors consider working during pregnancy vital to a woman's 
emotional health.

 FAIRING WELL: The tons of debris left in downtown Orange Sunday night after 
the annual Labor Day weekend fair told the story: For three days, the place was 
humming with hungry people. Fair officials estimate the crowd at a record

minor arrests. Says fair spokesman Marshall Feduk: "If anything stood out, it 
was the sheer pleasure of being safe." The fair already has 80 organizations on 
a waiting list for booths next year.

 The Tutsi-led government sent about 150 soldiers to begin taking control of 
southwestern Rwanda, where half a million Hutus have sought U.N. protection 
against feared reprisals for massacres during the country's devastating civil 
war. The new government, trying to consolidate its July victory, has promised 
it will not tolerate reprisals against Hutus for the slaughter of at least 
500,000 people, mostly civilians from Rwanda's Tutsi minority. Shaharyar Khan, 
the U.N. special representative for Rwanda, said the transition from U.N. to 
government control will take two to four weeks.

 Scott served as curator at the Claremont library from 1970 until his death, 
building one of the most renowned research collections on Scandinavia in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Cambridge, Mass., and brought up in Yankton, S.D., Scott earned his 
undergraduate degree at the University of Chicago and his doctorate at Harvard 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott is survived by a daughter, Karin Scott Gunn of Gloucester, Mass., a 
sister, Lavinia Scott of Claremont, and two granddaughters. His wife, Helen 
Giddings Scott, died in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Franklin D. 
Scott Fund for Migration Research, Department of History, Northwestern

CAPSIZED BOAT CARRIED TWICE ITS LOAD LIMIT; TRAGEDY: DESIGNED FOR 10, IT WAS 
CARRYING 19 PASSENGERS WHEN IT OVERTURNED, KILLING A 3-YEAR-OLD. THE OWNER MAY 
HAVE BEEN UNAWARE OF SAFE CAPACITY.

<P>
 A 24-foot-long pleasure boat that capsized Sunday outside Los Angeles Harbor, 
killing a 3-year-old child and injuring several others, was carrying twice the 
number of passengers considered safe by boating standards, experts said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The vessel -- crammed with 19 passengers, most of them children -- should have 
been carrying no more than 10 people, according to Coast Guard safety officials 
and local boating experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all talking about it today," said Mike Mutter of Dick Sherrer Marine 
in Norwalk. "That boat was awfully overloaded." 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard officials, however, have yet to state that the number of 
passengers was the main cause of the capsizing, saying their investigation is 
still under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Romero of La Puente, who had owned the craft for more than a year, may 
not have known its passenger limits because there was no capacity information 
displayed inside, officials said. Under federal law, boat manufacturers were 
not required to post such signs until 1982. Romero's boat was built in 1973, 
Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Peter Rennard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way for the operator to know," Rennard said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the boat, carrying three families on a fishing trip, 
took on water after it was slammed by a wave, possibly from a larger vessel 
passing by. 
</P>
<P>
 The water flooded the boat's hull through holes for electrical cables in the 
deck. That, coupled with the frantic movement of the passengers, may have 
overturned the vessel, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was water coming in, and there were people moving around," said 
Rennard. "The vessel rolled over with very little advance notice to the 
passengers." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Romero, 3, who was trapped in the boat's submerged cabin, was killed. 
Three other children required medical treatment for hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, one of the young victims was released from Long Beach Memorial 
Medical Center. A 4-year-old girl and a 10-month-old girl remained hospitalized 
at St. Mary's Medical Center. The older child was listed in fair condition and 
the baby was in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors, five adults and 13 children, were in the 65-degree water more 
than five hours Sunday night before they were rescued by the Coast Guard. The 
adults protected the children by placing them on the overturned hull of the 
boat. All of the youngsters were wearing life jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although limits vary according to the type of boat and the weight of the 
passengers, nine or 10 adults is usually the maximum for a 24-foot vessel 
similar to Romero's, said Anthony Sederstrom, a Coast Guard chief warrant 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty-four-feet is not a real large boat," Sederstrom said. "Nineteen people 
is a lot of people, granted a lot of them were children. It was pretty 
crowded." 
</P>
<P>
 Sederstrom said the Coast Guard boarded Romero's boat in February during a 
routine at-sea safety check and found no violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Coast Guard were to have boarded the boat (on Sunday), we would have 
probably escorted it back to the dock and terminated its use for unsafe 
conditions," Sederstrom said. "From the information I have, it was overloaded."

SYMBOLS OF THE SLAUGHTER; WEARY OF THE VIOLENCE, PEOPLE ARE SENDING SHOES TO 
WASHINGTON TO SPOTLIGHT THE 35,000 KILLED BY GUNS ANNUALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lorna Hawkins is sending four pairs of shoes to the cause, two for her sons 
who were gunned down, two more for the surviving sons of those sons. 
</P>
<P>
 The shoes will be a reminder of the dead and those who must go on. And when 
the thousands of shoes are finally brought together in Washington from around 
the nation this month -- an expected 35,000 pairs in all -- they will be used 
to show in grim fashion how many American lives gun violence has claimed in the 
course of a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The mountain of shoes will be piled beside the capital's Reflecting Pool on 
Sept. 20 to draw attention to the staggering number of people killed by guns 
each year in the United States. California, with an estimated 5,000 annual 
deaths by gun, accounts for nearly 15% of the nation's gun-related homicides, 
suicides and fatal accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hawkins, founder of the Los Angeles public access cable TV program 
"Drive-by Agony," two pairs will represent sons Joe, who was 21 when he was 
gunned down six years ago, and Gerald, who was 20 when he was shot to death the 
day before Thanksgiving in 1992. The other two pairs will be for grandsons 
Joevon and Gerald Jr., both now 5, both without fathers. "The awareness has to 
get out there about crime and the effect it has on families and the 
communities," she said. "I think anything that brings awareness is effective." 
</P>
<P>
 The use of shoes to depict the number of dead is an idea borrowed from the 
Holocaust Museum in Washington, where a display of about 4,000 shoes seized 
from victims of the Maidanek concentration camp bespeaks those terrible days. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun control advocates borrowed that technique for the first time last year. 
When Sen. Joseph D'Amato (R-N.Y.) would not meet with the group New Yorkers for 
Gun Control, members piled up about 250 pairs of shoes of gunshot victims on 
his office doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Katina Johnstone of Staten Island, N.Y., who came to believe that shoes 
could be an effective way of making gun violence a national issue. Johnstone 
has reason to champion the cause. Her husband, David, was gunned down in 1992 
as he was walking through a quiet neighborhood in San Francisco. He died a 
month later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only do these homicides shame me, but so does the silence when it is 
children being killed by guns," she said in a recent interview. "There is no 
public outcry." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnstone said the idea for a nationwide drive stemmed from discussions about 
how attention could be called to the gun issue without asking thousands of 
people to descend on Washington for a march. The upshot was the shoe campaign, 
which ran short notices in a number of magazines that target women and 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the campaign is being run by Women Against Gun Violence, 
formed last year and overseen by former Los Angeles Police Commissioner Ann 
Reiss Lane. She said people who donate shoes are being asked to include a short 
statement about how guns have affected them. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign has attracted the likes of Hawkins, who vividly remembers both 
moments when she learned that her sons had been killed. In the case of Joe, she 
recalls finding out that he was not the intended target. The people who told 
her this, she said, were the gang members who did the shooting. They went to 
the hospital to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came to the hospital and said they were looking for someone else," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Ann Taylor has joined the campaign as well. Her 17-year-old son, Willie, 
was shot and killed March 15, 1993, at Vermont Avenue and Imperial Highway. Two 
men, brandishing AK-47 machine guns, sprayed what was later estimated as 34 
shots into the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't appear anyone was being singled out," she said. "As my son reached 
the door of his friend's house, one bullet hit him in the back." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said her son's death opened her eyes to how dangerous the world of 
children is today -- how, for many, leaving their front porch is like embarking 
on a perilous journey. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't even ride the bus from one part of town to another," she said. 
"Even the innocent ones are carrying guns because they're scared. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to make some noise," she said. "And we're going to make it a 
woman's issue, since no one else wants to touch it." 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Turner, too, has joined the fight. Her son, Hank, was 19 when he was shot 
in the street five years ago. She said she never got the full story about why 
he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The hurt from his death was compounded by the fact that a gunfight between 
rival gang members broke out during the funeral. She lay on the ground, hoping 
she would not be hit as the two sides fought it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want his death to not mean anything," she said. "They have to see 
that these shoes belonged to someone out there, that they represent a life." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Korean Youth and Community Center, one of six places in Los Angeles 
where shoes are being collected, coordinator Kris Choi led the way to a small 
room. There were no more than 50 pairs, because the campaign had only begun. 
</P>
<P>
 One package had been sent by mail and in a short letter a teen-ager bemoaned 
the death of a classmate named Ochari D'Aiello, killed by a friend during an 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "The murderer had just picked up his mom's gun on the way out that night," the 
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another note, tucked in a pair of tennis shoes, said simply: "I pray that 
something will end all the violence before we lose all our children." 
</P>
<P>
 There were also the shoes of Shin Dal Kang, delivered to the center by his 
wife.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the lack of police protection at the time of the (1992) riot, my 
husband and our family lost all our personal and business savings," the note 
inside the shoes said. "We're now without a home. Crime must be punished and 
hard-working people like us must be protected. My husband committed suicide 
because criminals had more rights and benefits than he could obtain after the 
riot. This is truly a travesty of justice." 
</P>
<P>
 The six collection points are:  
</P>
<P>
 The Korean Youth and Community Center, 680 S. Wilton Place; Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, 4182 Southwestern Ave.; Drive-by Agony, 2555 Industry 
Way, Suite D, Lynwood; Mothers and Men Against Gangs, 1107 Papeet St., 
Wilmington; Venice Family Clinic, 604 Rose Ave., Venice, and the office of 
state Sen. Charles Calderon, 400 N. Montebello Blvd., Montebello.

WINNERS OF $33-MILLION JACKPOT READY TO BLAZE SOME NEW TRAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has become a cliche. Right after carrying off the pot of gold at the end of 
the state Lotto rainbow, the new multimillionaires announce that they will hang 
on to their humdrum jobs, maybe re-tile the bathroom and buy mom a swell 
present, but other than that remain the same old plain-living folks they always 
were. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that for James and Roberta Stevens of Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Living out the fantasies of millions of Lotto players statewide, the Stevenses 
-- whose $33.7-million jackpot is the third biggest one-player win in Lotto 
history -- picked up a new Lincoln lickety-split. Then they marched into work 
at Litton Industries in Woodland Hills on Tuesday and interrupted a senior 
management meeting to tell their bosses: Hasta la vista, baby. 
</P>
<P>
 And apparently to avoid tipping off any "long-lost relatives" or make new 
friends with worthy causes to support, they then clammed up and refused to hold 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "After winning such a large amount of money some people want a certain degree 
of privacy," explained lottery spokesman Bob Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement distributed by the lottery, James Stevens, 51, who until 
Tuesday morning was a data processing manager at Litton, said: "This is the 
greatest day of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stevenses will receive $1.68 million a year before taxes for 20 years. 
With withholding by the lottery administration of 28%, their check will be 
$1,213,200, and they will still owe the remainder of a probable federal tax 
rate of 39%. Lottery winnings are exempt from state income taxes. Their first 
check is expected in about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Taylor, James Stevens usually played five sets of favorite 
numbers in each of the twice-weekly Super Lotto drawings. On Saturday, during a 
visit with their daughter and son-in-law in Palmdale, he bought an additional 
$10 of tickets, this time allowing the Lotto computer to pick the numbers at 
random. 
</P>
<P>
 While visiting friends in Riverside on Sunday, Stevens checked the winning 
numbers in the newspaper and realized that he was holding the winning 
combination: 3, 4, 10, 30, 33 and 40. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell on the floor," Stevens said in the statement that lottery officials 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were yelling and screaming," said Roberta Stevens, 57, who until Tuesday 
was an accounting manager at Litton. 
</P>
<P>
 When they got back to their home in Newbury Park, they placed the winning 
ticket in the refrigerator. "I figured that if the house burned down that would 
be the safest place," James Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall Monday, they had acquired a new Lincoln, James Stevens said, and 
they are looking for a bigger motor home than their current 27-footer, because 
now that they don't have to work they plan to do a lot of traveling with their 
winnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to enjoy life and help our children," he said. Together they have 
five children from previous marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning ticket was purchased at the Desert View Superette in Palmdale. 
Store owner Sam Hawara will receive a 0.5% bonus for selling the winning 
ticket, $168,500 before taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great," Hawara said in an interview Tuesday. "I had never sold a 
winning jackpot ticket, but I was waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stevenses are the largest single winners in Ventura County, Taylor said. 
The previous high was a $17.1-million jackpot in February, 1990. Among single 
winners statewide, the Stevenses place third behind a $51.6-million jackpot in 
June, 1994, and a $43.3-million prize in December, 1990.

RIORDAN DECLARES AIDS EMERGENCY IN L.A.; HEALTH: ACTION IS DESIGNED TO STOP 
POLICE INTERFERENCE IN DISTRIBUTION OF CLEAN NEEDLES TO DRUG USERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that AIDS has reached epidemic proportions, Mayor Richard Riordan on 
Tuesday declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles in an effort to sidestep 
state law and allow the distribution of clean needles to drug users to continue 
without police interference. 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of the City Council, Riordan directed the city attorney and 
Police Department to avoid needless investigations of the needle exchanges that 
have been occurring throughout the city for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "With his signing this declaration, the mayor acknowledged the needs of IV 
drug users, their sexual partners and their families," said Rene Edgington, who 
runs Clean Needles Now in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Needle exchanges -- designed to reduce the transmission of AIDS through 
contaminated syringes -- have had the tacit approval of many city officials. 
Clean Needles Now recently received a $50,000 city grant, although the money 
must be used for AIDS education and not the purchase of syringes. 
</P>
<P>
 There are exchange programs in Hollywood, South-Central and Downtown, and 
activists are planning distribution in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy developed this year when complaints by Hollywood residents 
prompted the police to issue a citation to Edgington and seize many of her 
group's needles. To prevent future crackdowns, Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg 
urged the mayor to declare the state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the exchanges say giving out clean needles to intravenous drug 
users is a necessary way to limit the spread of AIDS. But the programs have 
prompted a flurry of criticism among those who argue that the exchanges condone 
illegal drug use and attract derelicts to the distribution sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan recognized those complaints and concerns in announcing the state of 
emergency. "These programs should be conducted . . . in stable, secure 
locations developed in consultation with residents of the community, business 
owners and other social service agencies," the mayor said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgington said she is worried about what Riordan's comments portend for her 
group, which sets up its operations on streets where drug users gather.  
</P>
<P>
 The state Legislature has twice voted to legalize needle exchanges, but both 
measures were vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson, who said in his veto message: "If we 
are going to demand that young people exercise personal responsibility, if we 
say that they must suffer the consequences of their personal choices, what are 
they to think when in the next breath we give formal sanction to a project 
which facilitates drug use?" 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's declaration will take effect next week when approved by the 
council. It will not legalize the possession of a hypodermic needle -- a 
violation of the state Business and Professional Code -- but will direct law 
enforcement officials to make citations a low priority. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley and several Northern 
California counties have used similar declarations as a way to combat the 
spread of AIDS. Los Angeles County is considering a similar move.

PROPOSED BURBANK AIRPORT TERMINAL DEBATED; TRANSIT: OFFICIALS CITE ECONOMIC 
BENEFITS AT PUBLIC SESSION. RESIDENTS COMPLAIN ABOUT NOISE PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A public meeting on the future of Burbank Airport became a debate Tuesday 
night over the relative merits of dollars and din, the airport's financial 
contribution to the city weighed against the annoyance it causes some 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 A televised joint session of the Burbank City Council and the 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority on plans to build a larger airport 
terminal drew a standing-room only crowd, which heard airport administrators 
detail its economic importance. 
</P>
<P>
 Using charts to underscore their points, they said the 435-acre facility 
generates $725,000 annually in property taxes, $300,000 each year in sales 
taxes and about 3,000 jobs directly linked to airport operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here. We provide to the economic tax base. We are not an economic 
deadbeat," said airport Controller Dios Marrero. "We, as an airport, expect to 
be the next boost in the arm for Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for many people living in the 2,000 homes directly impacted by airplane 
noise -- by airport administrators' count -- the airport has become more of a 
pain in the neck than a shot in the arm, especially with plans to quadruple the 
size of the terminal to 670,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans to construct a larger terminal have been the subject of heated 
debate for years, with critics accusing airport administrators of minimizing 
potential environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 A recently updated environmental impact study indicates that the larger new 
terminal would generate a number of adverse environmental effects, but would 
not significantly increase aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman who telephoned her comments to Tuesday night's meeting complained 
that airplane noise forces her to watch television "with a remote control in 
one hand to turn up the volume" and "my TV with captions on," referring to the 
optional subtitles for those with hearing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Another caller said: "I don't think we should shoot for being a secondary LAX 
just because there is the potential for business." 
</P>
<P>
 The airport administration must replace its current terminal to comply with 
FAA regulations; the building, constructed over 60 years ago, is too close to 
runways to meet modern safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials have said that the larger $185-million terminal is needed to 
accommodate an expected increase in passengers over the next 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials have said that they expect that after the new terminal is 
built, it will handle about 150 flight departures per day, about double the 
current number. 
</P>
<P>
 But airport officials say noise impacts will be lessened by quieter commercial 
planes in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials say the present 163,000-square-foot facility will serve at 
least 4.7 million passengers this year, compared to 4.3 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Susan Spanos asked whether the increased passenger demand has 
been influenced by the marketing efforts of airport officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Marrero responded: "Well, maybe a little bit." But, he added, low-fare 
carriers such as Southwest Airlines are the principal driving force behind 
increased passenger counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few people in attendance supported the airport's expansion plan, a 
larger number spoke against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have opposed the airport expansion, and nothing we heard tonight has 
changed our mind one bit," said Ted McConkey, president of the Burbank Rancho 
Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council has "absolutely no control over that airport," he 
told the council members. "Airport commissioners don't report to you. So give 
us a break." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the new terminal have been slowed in part by a court order that 
requires airport officials to re-examine the potential for noise, traffic and 
air pollution that a new terminal might bring. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city of Los Angeles has sued the airport's governing board, 
charging that the board failed to adequately address those issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Expansion of the Burbank Airport terminal has been a hot topic since 1975, 
when neighbors of the facility accused Burbank city officials of acquiring the 
facility solely for the sake of expanding its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint powers agreement among Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena that created 
the airport's governing board in the late 1970s prohibited runway expansion and 
required that the airport make every effort to mitigate noise. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the Burbank Airport has grown increasingly popular as a more 
convenient alternative to Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating revenues for the 1994-95 fiscal year are projected to be $56.4 
million, more than double those of the past two years. NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 The next step in the debate over the possible construction of a larger 
terminal at Burbank Airport takes place Sept. 23, when a court hearing will be 
held in Los Angeles. Airport officials will be required to show a Superior 
Court judge an updated environmental study of the project before any further 
steps can be taken. The court date may be pushed back, however, airport and Los 
Angeles city officials say. In addition, airport officials are waiting for the 
Lockheed Corp. to finish cleanup work on 120 acres where they plan to locate 
the new terminal. It is not clear how much longer the work will take, hindering 
the expansion plans.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; MTA 
TO RESUME SELLING MONTHLY BUS PASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monthly bus passes, which appeared to be headed for oblivion under a bus fare 
increase, will be made available again beginning Friday, the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA spokeswoman Andrea Greene said the popular monthly passes will be on sale 
Friday and Saturday at all the MTA's 460 token sales outlets, at the regular 
price of $42.After Sept. 10, she said, passengers will be able to purchase a 
$23 pass that will be good for the rest of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Multilingual brochures will also be made available early Friday alerting 
passengers to the resumption of sales, Greene said, and commercials regarding 
the changes will be broadcast beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "For now, we're back to how things were prior to the new fare structure," 
Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came in the wake of a federal court order last week that 
temporarily blocked an MTA fare restructuring. The MTA is hoping that a federal 
appeals court today will lift the court order issued Thursday that prevented 
the transit agency from raising the bus fare from $1.10 to $1.35 and 
eliminating the monthly passes. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. set a hearing Monday on claims that 
the fare increase discriminates against mostly poor and minority bus riders. 
</P>
<P>
 In court papers, the MTA has complained that the court order would create 
"administrative problems and confusion among MTA's patrons because the monthly 
pass will start in the second week of the month and could terminate on Sept. 12 
if a preliminary injunction is not granted." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Greene said it is unclear what will happen to pass holders should the 
court side with the MTA before the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're only dealing with complying with the federal court order," 
she said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; FIRM PUTS STOCK IN HIRING DEAF FILM EDITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Film & Video Stock Shots, a small North Hollywood company, is giving deaf and 
hearing-impaired film editors their own shot at making it in the entertainment 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The company assembles snippets of film and video used in movies, television 
and industrial films.  
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Siebert, president, started hiring deaf and hard-of-hearing people 
at the beginning of this year as a challenge to herself and her industry. 
Siebert said she had never met a deaf or hearing-impaired person who worked in 
the entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
 Since all the footage that Stock Shots provides for motion pictures is silent, 
editors don't need to be able to hear.  
</P>
<P>
 "You have to set out to commit to hiring people with a specific need," said 
Siebert, who went to the National Center on Deafness at Cal State Northridge 
and the Greater Los Angeles Assn. for the Deaf in search of potential 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Siebert made her office deaf-friendly by installing a Teletype machine and a 
smoke alarm that flashes a strobe light when it goes off as well as sounding a 
buzzer. She also put a closed-captioned television in the lunchroom. 
</P>
<P>
 All the hearing employees in the office, including Siebert, have taken one 
class in American Sign Language and plan to take a second one next month, she 
said. And everyone at the company tries to use signing as often as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But just in case of a breakdown in communications, everybody in the office has 
an erasable board for writing down more complicated conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the company has one hearing-impaired employee and two deaf 
employees. Over the past nine months, other employees with hearing impairments 
have gone on to become script writers and script readers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of deaf and hard-of-hearing people interested in the 
(entertainment) industry," Siebert said, "but they don't have a good toehold on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 At Stock Shots, hearing-impaired employees are gradually trained to work in 
every aspect of the stock footage business, from filing film clips to finding 
the perfect shot a director has requested of a black Volvo exploding as it 
zooms off a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Kasaus, who is hard of hearing, has been working at Stock Shots for 
nine months. Her editing job, she said, is something she has dreamed of doing 
since college. A 1978 graduate of Cal State Northridge with a major in radio, 
television and film, this is Kasaus' first job in the movie business. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to use sound. It's very visual," Kasaus said of film editing. 
</P>
<P>
 It can also involve editors in some strange projects. Kasaus said she recently 
edited footage of a live X-ray shot of food being digested for a music video by 
the rock group The Offspring. MAKI BECKER

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; LAPD TAKING BLUSH 
OUT OF BEING SWINDLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many are fleeced but few are complaining. They are just too embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the victims of street scams, who are afraid to talk because they 
think they will look naive -- at least in the Latino community, where half of 
such crimes occur citywide, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes con games one of the most underreported crimes in the city -- with 
probably 80% of victims simply keeping quiet about what happened to them, say 
Los Angeles Police Department bunco detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in a move to remove the stigma that victims feel, police now say that if 
you report such a crime, they won't tell anyone -- not even your wife -- 
although the district attorney may want you to testify in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no guns or violence are used, con games can still have deadly 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, for example, a Los Angeles man in his 60s who lost $14,000 in a scam 
was so devastated, police said, that he didn't tell his family. Soon after, he 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to him on the telephone one day and he was supposed to come in to 
see some pictures (of suspects), and when I called him the next day, the police 
were already there" to handle his suicide, said Detective Robert Ramos of the 
LAPD bunco squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have such mental anguish," Ramos said about the victims.  
</P>
<P>
 There are several ways for the unsuspecting to lose their money -- or whatever 
else they have. 
</P>
<P>
 Swindles that target Latinos, conducted in Spanish, go by names such as Latin 
Lotto, the Charity Scheme, and the Gold Bar, sometimes called the Diamond 
Scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say a typical ruse, which usually nets the criminals about $3,500 to 
$5,000 per scam, works like this: 
</P>
<P>
 In the Diamond or Gold Bar Scheme, the con artist poses as a poor person who 
has found "diamonds" or "a gold bar" which he says fell from a vehicle or was 
accidentally dropped during an immigration raid. 
</P>
<P>
 The con artist approaches a victim and says he doesn't know what the valuables 
are worth. Enter an accomplice, pretending to be another stranger, who 
convinces the victim that the deal is too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 The first swindler offers to sell the valuables to the victim for a price far 
less than their supposed value. When the victim hands over the cash, the con 
artists disappear, leaving their pigeon with a brass bar or a handful of 
diamond-like zircons. 
</P>
<P>
 The other ruses are similar: in the end you are out your money. 
</P>
<P>
 Con artists target other Spanish speakers from Woodland Hills to Pacoima, at 
banks, Social Security offices and parking lots. If an ATM is nearby or a place 
where senior citizens gather, Ramos said, you are likely to find swindlers 
there, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like fishing for these people, they find their favorite spot and fish 
again," said Ramos, adding that one spot is targeted for a few months and then 
the hustlers will move on.  
</P>
<P>
 Ramos knows a lot about the bad guys, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The swindlers are following a rich tradition, employing scams passed on by 
older con artists to younger criminals, hand-picked to carry on a legacy of 
thievery. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is honor among these thieves," Ramos said. "They look for (apprentices) 
who are very trustworthy, someone who can play the role and has the gift of 
gab." They learn to act naive, lost or very poor, eliciting either sympathy or 
greed on the part of the victim.  
</P>
<P>
 These new recruits go through a "screening process," said Ramos, and must have 
previous criminal experience and prove they can handle police if questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past six years, Morris Dondick, 70, has taught English as a Second 
Language in Pacoima. Each year, he noticed, students reported being swindled in 
street scams. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of them bought what was supposed to be gold bars for $7,000 on the 
street" from a con artist and accomplice, Dondick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told them she wanted to talk to her husband first," Dondick said. "They 
sort of intimidated her into going to the bank right then." 
</P>
<P>
 Dondick wanted to do something about it and added a lesson in street smarts 
for his ESL course, the main lesson being "if it is too good to be true, it 
probably isn't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, I asked the class if any of them had been victims of (con 
games) and a lot of them just sort of looked down with wry smiles," Dondick 
said. "They are very reluctant to talk about it."

DESERT FLORA; HOW THEY SURVIVE THE HARSH CONDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life in the high desert hinterlands can be cruel. High temperatures in the 
summer, little water and sparse shade make it hard on animals and people. But 
several members of the plant world have adapted to these harsh conditions and 
even thrive in them. Their superficial root systems, water storage capabilities 
and waxy leaves allow them to survive through high and low extremes. In 
Lancaster, for example, the average high temperature is 98 degrees in July. In 
January, the average low is 29 degrees. Here's a look at some of the plants in 
and around the Antelope Valley, that make their home in the western Mojave 
Desert. Beavertail Cactus ( Opuntia basilaris )  
</P>
<P>
 Only one of two native cacti to the western Mojave Desert, the beavertail 
cactus -- with its distinctive magenta or white flowers -- gets its name from 
the shape of its pads. Water is stored in the pads and it reproduces with 
seeds. The stomata, surface pores which carry out photosynthesis, open only at 
night when humidity is higher and the plant is less likely to lose precious 
water. Its skin is waxy to reduce water loss, but fleshy inside. Instead of 
long needles or leaves, the beavertail has small bunches of short spines that 
reduce water loss. It grows 6 to 12 inches high and 1 to 6 feet in diameter. 
Joshua Tree ( Yucca brevifolia )  
</P>
<P>
 Rigid leaves covered by a waxy surface help the Joshua tree survive in the 
desert by being able to resist wilting and water loss. Its widespread roots are 
about 3 feet deep. Water is stored in its trunk and leaves. The plant is 
pollinated mainly by the yucca moth and reproduction of the plant occurs when 
its black, flat seeds are scattered in the wind or when underground stems 
sprout near the parent tree. Joshua trees don't flower every spring. This 
flowering is also tied to weather. Joshua trees produce few flowers after a 
warm winter, more after a cold one. A large Joshua will be about 30 feet tall, 
although there is one 58 feet tall in Lancaster that is estimated to be 1,000 
years old. Bigelow's Coreopsis ( Coreopsis bigelovii ) 
</P>
<P>
 While Joshua trees and cacti grow very slowly, this wildflower survives in the 
desert by growing quickly. The reason: Its leaves can only store small amounts 
of water. An annual, it germinates in the fall, blooms in the spring and dies 
off in summer, sitting out the hottest months. Some years are better than 
others for the Bigelow's coreopsis. The seeds will only germinate when soil 
temperatures are low and moisture content of the soil is high. Found more 
commonly in the western Mojave Desert, they grow 6 inches to 2 feet tall. Rain 
Catchers 
</P>
<P>
 When it doesn't rain very often, water doesn't have a chance to soak deep into 
the soil. As a result, cacti have shallow, wide-ranging root systems allow them 
to grab as much rainfall as possible. The roots have tiny hairs that help them 
collect water. The plants often grow spaced out because of stiff water 
competition below the surface.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; BOY SHOT IN FACE IS IN STABLE CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victor Tamayo, a Van Nuys 14-year-old shot in the face by a 12-year-old friend 
Friday, was reported in "stable and improving" condition Tuesday at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor was critically injured when he and his friend, Roberto Ortiz Jr., were 
playing with a loaded .38-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 They were playing with the weapon in the living room of Roberto's Van Nuys 
apartment when the gun went off, striking Victor in the left upper cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after Friday's shooting, Roberto told police he and Victor found the 
handgun a week ago in Van Nuys near the baseball diamond at Delano Park, where 
the boys play on the same baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and later released to 
his father's custody. Although he originally told police that Victor had 
accidentally shot himself, Roberto admitted after further questioning that he 
himself accidentally pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Ryder, deputy district attorney for Los Angeles County, is reviewing the 
case and expects to make a final decision today. ALICIA DOYLE

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PIGEON ERADICATION PROPOSALS REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five proposals to eradicate thousands of pigeons from downtown Glendale were 
rejected by the City Council on Tuesday as being either too expensive or too 
inhumane. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, city officials will rely on two measures to curb the overwhelming 
number of pigeons: an ordinance banning pigeon feeding in public areas, and an 
education program that includes posting signs warning residents not to feed the 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the City Council had agreed to contract with Los Angeles County to 
catch and kill the birds. But when it turned out that the county's plan was to 
kill the pigeons by placing them in bags and tying them to an automobile 
tailpipe, city officials began looking at other alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Five firms recently proposed ideas, two of which were to trap the pigeons and 
set them free in the Mojave Desert or near Bakersfield. The other suggestions 
were to use a gluey substance that would stick to the birds' feet when they 
land on it, add a potentially fatal chemical to the bird's food and stretch a 
coil along all landing surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Still another resident made this recommendation Tuesday: "They must be shot 
at. . . . They have got to realize they better be afraid of humans," said Gene 
Blankenship, 77. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; FEDERAL 
JURY FINDS MAN GUILTY IN PRISON SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ex-Maywood man was convicted Tuesday of strangling a fellow inmate to get 
into the Aryan Brotherhood -- a prison gang whose members are notorious for 
committing murders and selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal jury found that Richard Glenn Filkins, 35, used a garrote made of 
bedsheets to kill Avra Lee Ray, 36, as he lay on his cell bed in a 
heroin-induced stupor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aug. 9, 1989, killing took place at the Lompoc federal penitentiary.  
</P>
<P>
 Filkins testified that he was friendly with the inmate known as Baby Ray and 
did not kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and Filkins' alleged accomplice, Thomas (Buzz) Miller, told the 
jury that Filkins, serving time for several bank robberies in Los Angeles, 
carried out an order from the Aryan Brotherhood leaders who believed that Ray 
violated gang rules.  
</P>
<P>
 Ray apparently broke several gang rules by getting involved with a homosexual 
romance and refusing to share his drugs with an elder gang member, prosecutors 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who stood guard outside Ray's cell while Filkins was inside, pleaded 
guilty to aiding and abetting the murder. He faces life in prison without 
parole when he is sentenced.  
</P>
<P>
 Filkins will be sentenced Nov. 21.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JURY URGES 
LIFE TERM FOR MAN CONVICTED OF MURDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury recommended life without parole Tuesday for one of two men convicted of 
stabbing two Antelope Valley teen-agers to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Orona, 22, of Palmdale was found guilty of first-degree murder, 
conspiracy and the special circumstance allegations of murder while lying in 
wait and multiple murder for the 1992 killings of David Benjamin Scott and 
Daniel Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
 Orona is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 28 by Superior Court Judge Robert 
Perry.  
</P>
<P>
 Joe Orcasitas, 21, also was convicted of the crimes. The same jury was still 
deliberating between a recommendation of life without parole and the death 
penalty for Orcasitas.  
</P>
<P>
 The partially decomposed bodies of Scott, 14, and Kufeldt, 15, were found June 
22, 1992, beside a desolate road near Llano. The boys had been missing for 
nearly a month.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Smalstig said Orcasitas fatally stabbed the teen-agers 
as part of a plan he had worked out with Orona. The prosecutor said the 
defendants believed that Scott had told authorities that Orcasitas and Orona 
were involved in a string of burglaries.  
</P>
<P>
 Orona and Orcasitas drove off with the boys, tricking them into believing they 
were going to burglarize a nearby home, Smalstig said.

GUARD DELIVERING CASH KILLED IN HOLDUP AT BEVERLY HILLS BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gunman shot and killed a Brinks armored car guard Tuesday as he delivered a 
bag of money to a Manufacturers Bank branch in Beverly Hills, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness told a television station that the guard was shot in the head at 
close range.Authorities identified him as Dennie Plese, 60, of Valencia. The 
gunman apparently lay in wait, ambushing Plese about 8:40 a.m., before the bank 
opened, the witness said. Plese died in the lobby of the building at 9701 
Wilshire Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman escaped with an undisclosed amount of cash, Lt. Frank Salcido said. 
Plese's partner remained in the truck and was unaware of the shooting until 
told by the witness, the lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salcido described the suspect as white, in his early 30s, between 5 feet, 9 
inches and 5 feet, 10 inches tall, with black hair and a black mustache. The 
gunman has a long, narrow face, a medium build and was wearing a dress shirt, 
tie and dark pants, Salcido said. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness told a television station that he opened the lobby door, "and 
there's a guy with a bullet hole in the back of his head and blood all around. 
It looked professionally done . . . close range, right in the back of the 
head."  
</P>
<P>
 The witness said he had always felt safe in Beverly Hills, but Tuesday's 
killing "just throws off your world."

JURORS MAY LOSE ANONYMITY IN TWO JUDGES' COURTROOMS; LEGAL SYSTEM: APPEALS 
COURT SIGNALS THAT IT MAY HALT PRACTICE OF MUNICIPAL COURT JURISTS IN 
BELLFLOWER AND DOWNEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two Municipal Court judges who have created controversy by keeping secret the 
names of all jurors in their criminal cases have received a strong signal from 
an appeals court that their practices might be halted. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting independently of each other in two cases, two judges from the Superior 
Court's appellate department issued notices saying they "may" grant defense 
motions demanding the release of jurors' names in cases before Judges Philip K. 
Mautino in Bellflower and David Lord in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers and judges familiar with the Superior Court's appellate department, 
which resolves disputes in Municipal Court, say the notices are issued only 
when judges are inclined to grant what is requested and seek to give the 
potentially losing party the chance to persuade them otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The county counsel's office, which is defending the Municipal Court judges' 
right to use anonymous juries in all criminal cases, and the Los Angeles County 
public defender's office, which seeks to halt the practice, have until Sept. 13 
and Sept. 19, respectively, to file additional written arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very strong signal that they are inclined to stop judges from 
having anonymous juries in these two cases, where there is no showing of a need 
for it," said Alex Ricciardulli, who is handling the appeals for the public 
defender's office.  
</P>
<P>
 The public defender has decided to challenge any judge who grants automatic 
anonymity to all jurors in criminal cases instead of evaluating the need for 
anonymity on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate department is likely to decide the issue before the Sept. 30 
trial date set in the Downey case. But because the Bellflower case is set for 
trial today, Ricciardulli on Tuesday asked the appellate judge in that case, 
Barbara Jean Johnson, to decide the issue immediately. She declined to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bellflower case may be postponed or dismissed for other reasons. But if it 
is held with an anonymous jury and the appellate department later decides that 
that was improper, the public defender can ask that the case be retried. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Superior Court judges make their rulings, they will apply only to the 
two cases at hand: the Downey case of Dennis Jansen, who is accused of 
violating a restraining order, and the Bellflower case of Patrick Chesney, who 
is charged with battery and annoying a child for allegedly touching a young 
boy's buttocks at a public pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cases before the appellate court are the first to be appealed; other 
cases will be appealed until a state appeals court -- whose rulings are binding 
on all California courts -- decides the issue, said Steve Lund, deputy public 
defender in Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
 When told Tuesday of the appellate department's inclinations, Mautino and Lord 
said that if they lose in Superior Court, they plan to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mautino, who is the presiding judge of Los Cerritos Municipal Court in 
Bellflower, and Lord, presiding judge of Downey Municipal Court, both said they 
would reveal jurors' names in the Chesney and Jansen cases if ordered to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 In their other cases, Lord said the chances are "very high" that he would 
continue to use nameless panels until a higher court stopped him. Mautino said 
he would "continue to follow a policy of anonymity in every criminal case until 
ordered to do otherwise. I don't intend to back down." 
</P>
<P>
 Lord and one other judge in his courthouse withhold the names of jurors in all 
criminal cases. Mautino's policy goes further: It extends to all five 
courtrooms in the courthouse he heads. Both judges began the policy this year 
to better implement, in their view, a section of the California Code of Civil 
Procedure that offers jurors anonymity at the end of a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Both judges reasoned that if that section is aimed at protecting jurors from 
threats and harassment, it is meaningless unless anonymity is offered at the 
beginning of a trial. Mautino also believed that people are becoming 
increasingly nervous about jury duty and that having their names withheld might 
make them more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 But some legal scholars and defense attorneys criticized such blanket 
anonymity, saying it deprives defendants of public trials by shrouding the 
jurors in secrecy, and injects bias into cases by implying that defendants are 
dangerous because jurors need protection from them.

MAN CLEARED IN ASSAULTS BY PHONY INS AGENT; INVESTIGATION: FOUR VICTIMS WHO 
WERE SHOWN A NEW PHOTO OF THE SUSPECT SAY HE DID NOT SEXUALLY ATTACK THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Christopher Aguayo was surprisingly good-natured Tuesday about the more than 
four days he spent in jail for assaults on women that he didn't commit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good experience," Aguayo said in an interview in his San Gabriel 
apartment. "Being in jail for five days gave me time to think about what kind 
of person I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, El Monte police treated him well. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, they treated him even better. They let Aguayo go, saying that 
although he bore a strong resemblance to the attacker, he is not a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguayo, a 22-year-old unemployed waiter, was suspected of posing as an 
immigration officer to gain entry to homes, then sexually assaulting 24 
Spanish-speaking women. He was arrested Thursday night and held on $5-million 
bail before his release Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that the real attacker is still at large. "I'm going to get 
this guy," El Monte Police Detective John Fentress said. "But I'm going to get 
the right guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The man is suspected of assaulting 21 women in El Monte, two in San Gabriel 
and one in Temple City between November, 1993, and Aug. 10.  
</P>
<P>
 A man who said he was an immigration officer gained entry to the women's 
apartments, telling victims he needed to search them for weapons. He often 
fondled his victims' breasts and genital areas and sometimes told them their 
families would be deported if they did not cooperate, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 9, the man sexually assaulted a 13-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguayo was arrested after police received an anonymous call from a woman who 
said she suspected he was the impostor. Six victims picked Aguayo's mug shot 
from a folder containing six black and white photographs of different men, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 But because Aguayo has no prior criminal record, the only photograph the 
police could get of Aguayo was a faxed copy of a 1993 DMV photograph.  
</P>
<P>
 While Aguayo was in jail, police took color photographs of him and went back 
to five of the six women and showed them the recent photos. Four of the five 
said Aguayo was not the man who assaulted them. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are looking for a white man or a light-complexioned Latino between 5 
feet 10 inches and 6 feet tall and weighing 170 to 200 pounds. The impostor 
spoke little Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguayo said he had no hard feelings toward police. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the guy out there looks exactly like me," he said. "I'm a Gemini. I 
have a twin somewhere."

COUNTY TO DO ITS OWN FILM PERMITTING; HOLLYWOOD: SUPERVISORS WILL SEVER 
CONTRACT WITH COMPANY THAT PROVOKED CRITICISM. DIRECTOR FIRED BY FIRM WILL FILL 
NEW POST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Moving to resolve a brewing controversy that threatened to undermine relations 
with the powerful movie and television industry, the Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously approved a plan to reclaim control of 
film permitting operations and hire Stephanie H. Liner as the new industry 
go-between. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's vote means the county will sever its contract with the private, 
nonprofit Economic Development Corp., which it hired in 1990 to issue location 
shooting permits, collect fees and promote the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The film office now will become part of the Department of Regional Planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The county will create a new film liaison position to be filled by Liner, 
whose dismissal by the Economic Development Corp. as film office director last 
month provoked a storm of protest among industry heavyweights and propelled the 
doings of the little-known film branch into the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Stephanie's return serves as a signal to the industry that we mean business 
in retaining industry jobs in Los Angeles County," Supervisor Mike Antonovich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the transition from private to public control, few changes are 
expected in the overall operation of the film permitting office. Regional 
Planning Director Jim Hartl said his department already has ties with many film 
representatives and that he will seek to strengthen those relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to do film permits before the film office was created and already 
control land use permits, so I think it's a natural fit," Hartl said. "We 
intend to launch an outreach program with the industry to assure them services 
will not drop, and will be looking for input on what their needs are. Our 
message to the industry is that we're here to support and to help and we will 
do what we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The board's action was seen by many observers as recognition of the importance 
of the multibillion-dollar film industry and is expected to quicken efforts to 
merge the county's film office with that of the city of Los Angeles, a 
consolidation that Liner has championed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides acting as a problem solver and seeing to the day-to-day needs of 
producers and film crews, one of Liner's key concerns will be shepherding to 
completion the proposed merger, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also ordered Hartl to report within 30 days on what steps must be 
taken to consolidate city and county film permit operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials applauded the board's actions and said they are encouraged 
that consolidation will move more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors has agreed on the concept. Although Mayor Richard 
Riordan has indicated support, the City Council must still approve the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think with the city watching the county move at lightning speed, it has 
been given an incentive to move as quickly as it can," said Gini Barrett, vice 
president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.

PAROLE IN 'ONION FIELD' CASE DENIED; PRISONS: PANEL SAYS KILLER OF LAPD OFFICER 
IS UNSUITABLE FOR RELEASE. IT CITES HIS FAILURE TO TAKE PART IN COUNSELING AND 
THE NATURE OF THE 1963 CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gregory Powell, whose point-blank murder of a Los Angeles police officer 
inspired the book and movie "The Onion Field," was turned down Tuesday in his 
bid for parole. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-member panel of the state Board of Prison Terms said Powell, 60, was 
unsuitable for release because of his failure to participate in prison 
counseling and vocational programs, and because of the nature of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which said Powell could apply again for release in two years, also 
noted that he was on parole when the 1963 murder occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell is incarcerated at the Deuel Vocational Institution, about 60 miles 
east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "His prior criminal record, social factors and the fact that he earlier had 
three prison terms and was on parole when he committed the murder" also played 
a part in the board's decision, spokeswoman Liz Tanaka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith were convicted and sentenced to death in the March, 
1963, kidnap-murder of Officer Ian Campbell, who was abducted at night from a 
Hollywood street with his partner and driven to an onion field 30 miles 
southwest of Bakersfield, where Powell shot him to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell also fired at the partner, Officer Karl Hettinger, who managed to 
escape into the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime and prolonged trial were the subject of Joseph Wambaugh's 1973 book 
"The Onion Field," later made into a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The death sentence was thrown out in the 1970s when the state Supreme Court 
determined that California's death penalty law was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who was paroled in 1982, has been in and out of trouble over the years, 
including a prison sentence on heroin charges in 1986.  
</P>
<P>
 Hettinger left the police force in 1972 and returned to Bakersfield, where he 
served on the Kern County Board of Supervisors. He died in May at age 59.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: NEIGHBORS TELL CONCERNS OVER CITYWALK SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two brawls in as many months and what some say is an increasing gang 
presence in and around Universal CityWalk, some neighbors are questioning the 
safety of an attraction touted as a highly stylized version of Los Angeles -- 
but without the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having a cup of coffee and reading a book at one of these lovely bookstores 
no longer seems possible," said Tony Lucente, president of the Studio City 
Residents Assn. "We're concerned about what seems to be an increasing number of 
incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest incident took place Saturday outside the nearby Universal 
Amphitheater after a Mexican rock concert. Police arrested eight people -- most 
on misdemeanor charges of battery, one for allegedly punching a police 
officer's horse -- after cordoning off the area to keep the fight from 
spreading into the neon-lighted CityWalk. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the first such altercation, despite what CityWalk officials say is 
an orderly environment where even wearing a baseball cap backward -- gang-style 
-- can get one tossed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department records indicate numerous crimes 
around Universal Studios -- from a stabbing inside a movie theater a year ago 
to a chair-throwing gang fight in August. And after just more than a year in 
business, CityWalk is earning a reputation of disorder with some neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was to be like a shopping area, nice restaurants, UCLA Extension 
classes," Studio City activist Polly Ward said. "What's happened . . . is 
frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Hanson, vice president of corporate communications for MCA, said 
crime figures at Universal are not above the norm for an entertainment complex 
that can lure tens of thousands of people on a single night. With massive 
numbers in a small place, she said, occasional problems are bound to arise. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a small incident . . . that can happen walking down any street," she 
said of the recent fight, adding that both private security guards and deputies 
from an on-site sheriff's substation patrol the walkways and have quickly 
quelled most altercations. 
</P>
<P>
 Many area residents said they are concerned that crime at CityWalk and its 
nearby attractions may migrate to their neighborhoods when the lights at 
Universal are switched off each night. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the residents association plan to meet with Los Angeles Police 
Department officials within the next week. They will go over crime statistics 
in the area to see if the attractions seem to be luring criminals along with 
sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens up there is their problem. But what happens down here is our 
problem," said Patty Kirby, who heads up the residents association's Partners 
Against Crime committee. 
</P>
<P>
 As plans evolve for expansion of CityWalk, Hanson said security measures would 
be "constantly re-evaluated." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have every intention of . . . helping to ensure that we all have a nice 
neighborhood to live in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucente said those in Studio City feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The debate is really starting to come to a head," he said. ERIC SLATER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 1 FATALITY REPORTED IN SANTA CLARITA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One person died in a Santa Clarita Valley traffic accident during Labor Day 
weekend, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The individual died in Newhall, CHP Officer Pablo Torres said.Overall, 13 
people died in traffic accidents in Los Angeles County, an increase from three 
fatalities last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, fatal traffic accidents over the Labor Day holiday fell 44%, to 38 
from 68 last year.  
</P>
<P>
 The local increase in fatal traffic accidents occurred even though CHP 
officers stepped up their patrols over the busy weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we increased our visibility, there are always people out there 
who will drink and drive or drive hazardously," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP arrested 75 people suspected of driving drunk in the San Fernando, 
Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys between 6 p.m. Friday and midnight Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, 41 arrests were made in the West Valley, 26 in the Newhall area and 
eight in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 346 drunk-driving arrests were made throughout Los Angeles County, 
down 31% from 503 arrests over the Labor Day weekend last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrol officers made 1,702 arrests statewide, an 18% decline, compared with 
the 2,070 arrests they made during the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department reported one traffic fatality in Encino and 
four fatalities in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures on the number of Labor Day traffic accidents handled by the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department were not available Tuesday. ALICIA DOYLE

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: GOVERNOR GETS BILL ON QUAKE TAX BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bill that would give earthquake victims a big tax break has passed the state 
Legislature and now goes to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, SB 561, would allow victims of the Jan. 17 temblor to deduct all 
uninsured losses exceeding $100 on their state income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say the bill would provide tax relief to thousands of Southern 
Californians who are struggling to repair or rebuild homes damaged by last 
January's disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), the bill's sponsor, stressed 
that it is important that California's congressional delegation work to enact 
the federal companion bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal bill would allow quake victims to deduct all uninsured losses on 
their federal income taxes and individuals could choose to take the deduction 
in either the 1993 or 1994 tax year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Arredondo , a spokesman for the governor's office, said that the 
governor is reviewing the bill. Wilson has until Sept. 30 to decide whether or 
not to sign it. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; CULINARY EVENT GIVES SCHOOLS SUSTENANCE

<P>
 It's almost that time again, to pig out on pizza, savor fine wine and gobble 
rich desserts without a twinge of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, chowing down at the seventh annual Taste of Encino is actually 
something to feel good about. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you eat goes right back into the community," said Daniel Weidman, a 
spokesman for the event, which every year raises about $16,000 for local 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 About 34 San Fernando Valley restaurants will offer low-priced samples of 
their fare Sept. 17 and 18 at the Courtyard Shops of Encino on Ventura 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Encino Chamber of Commerce, the event drew 25,000 people last 
year and raised $16,000 for area schools. About that much also went to the 
chamber for community projects such as graffiti removal. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Birmingham High School, Taft High School, Zane Grey High School, 
Emelita Street Elementary, Encino Elementary, Nestle Avenue Elementary and 
Mulholland Middle School will benefit from the event. 
</P>
<P>
 With the proceeds, the chamber purchases supplies, including pens, pencils and 
computer equipment, that schools have requested and donates them directly to 
the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Courtyard Shops of Encino is at 17401 Ventura Blvd. The event runs from 11 
a.m. to 6 p.m. both days. Daily admission is $2 for the general public, $1 for 
senior citizens and free for children under 5. SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; COMPOSTING PLANT GRAND OPENING SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Final preparations are under way for the dedication later this month of the 
new Rancho Las Virgenes composting facility, one of the first in the United 
States to recycle nearly all of the water and solids from the sewage it 
collects. 
</P>
<P>
 The $50-million plant turns sewer sludge into garden fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand opening is scheduled for Sept. 28 at the $50-million facility at 
3700 Las Virgenes Road. Reservations are required, according to Steve Witbeck, 
reclamation supervisor for Las Virgenes Municipal Water District, which built 
the facility. Anyone interested should call 880-4110 by Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The event includes self-guided tours and a talk by Dr. Alan Rubin, senior 
scientist of the Water Environment Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant was fully operational in May, Witbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the final product can be used as fertilizer, it must be documented 
safe, Witbeck said. District customers will be offered the product free. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which serves 20,000 homes, already purifies waste water it 
receives and uses most of that to irrigate farmland.  
</P>
<P>
 The new facility works like this: Sewer solids are brought by pipe from the 
Tapia water reclamation facility, about two miles away. The sludge is kept in 
tanks in the new facility for about two months, to allow microscopic bugs to 
feed on harmful bacteria.  
</P>
<P>
 The sludge is then spun dry and pushed by conveyor belt to another building, 
where it is mixed with sawdust and baked for another month. The entire facility 
is enclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas City Manager Charles Cate said Tuesday that the city is hoping to 
eventually be able to use some of its green waste in the processing of sludge 
at the facility. That would help the city comply with a state law that requires 
the city to reduce the amount of solid waste that it takes to landfills by 25% 
in 1995 and 50% by the year 2000. FRANK MANNING

13 TRAFFIC DEATHS OCCUR IN COUNTY OVER WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirteen people died in traffic accidents in Los Angeles County over the Labor 
Day weekend, compared to three during the same period last year, the California 
Highway Patrol reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the number of fatalities declined dramatically, from 68 last year 
to 38 for the 78-hour period that ended at midnight Monday, said CHP Officer 
Tito Gomez. He said the figures could change.  
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, 346 motorists were arrested on suspicion of driving 
under the influence of drugs or alcohol, compared to 503 last year. Statewide, 
there were 1,702 such arrests over the weekend, compared to 2,070 last year.

VALLEY BRIEFING: FARE WARS; HOW PROPOSED BUS HIKES WOULD WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Thursday, just hours after higher bus fares went into effect, a federal 
judge temporarily blocked the fare hike by the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority, saying that the 25-cent increase could unfairly burden poor and 
minority residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision stunned the MTA, which had counted on the first fare hike in six 
years to help bridge an operating deficit of $126 million. The agency has 
appealed for a stay of U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr.'s temporary 
restraining order, contending that it is losing tens of thousands of dollars 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter has set a hearing for Monday to decide whether the MTA has effectively 
penalized its mostly low-income bus riders by pursuing costly rail projects 
that benefit mostly affluent white customers, as a coalition of grass-roots 
organizations has alleged. * Changes If the MTA is allowed to implement its new 
fare structure, the following changes would take place: The basic fare would 
rise from $1.10 to $1.35. * Transfers would stay the same after 25 cents. * 
Tokens would stay the same at 90 cents apiece. * Regular monthly passes would 
be eliminated. * Monthly passes for senior citizens and the disabled, including 
blind passengers, who previously traveled for free, would increase to $12 from 
$10. * Monthly passes for college and vocational school students would increase 
to $30 from $25. * Monthly passes for schoolchildren would increase to $20 from 
$18, but would be good for for weekend travel. * Zone surcharges of 50 cents 
would apply on express bus lines and the Blue Line trolley. * The System 
Riders: 1.2 million daily, about half of whom held passes of some kind as of 
Aug. 31. * Fleet: 1,900 buses. * Bus drivers: 4,100 full-and part-time. Impact 
of Far Hike MTA officials predict a 5% drop in ridership, or about 60,000 
passengers daily, if the fare hike is allowed to go forward. * Token 
Information Bus tokens cost 90 cents and can be purchased in bags of 10 for $9. 
There are 460 token outlets in the region. For information on outlet locations, 
call (213) 972-6235. The information line is open from 8 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. 
Monday through Friday. * Who Rides the Bus? * Household Income Under $15,000: 
61.5% $15,000-$30,000: 23.2% $31,000-$50,000: 10.4% Over $50,000: 4.9% * Autos 
in Household No cars: 51% 1 car: 30.7% 2 cars: 13.1% 3 or more: 5.2% * 
Ethnicity Latino: 46.7% Black: 22.7% White: 19.1% Asian: 8.5% Other*: 3% * 
Includes Native American * Age Under 18: 13.9% 19-29: 27.1% 30-39: 23.7% 40-49:

SERBIAN GOOD FAITH? DON'T COUNT ON IT; A RECKLESS LIFTING OF SANCTIONS COULD 
HAVE DIRE EFFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina seceded from a disintegrating 
Yugoslavia in 1991, Serbia invaded, using the Bosnian Serb minority as local 
allies. The undisguised goal of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was to 
keep as much of the original Yugoslavia as possible under Serb control and to 
"cleanse" captured territory of non-Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 As the war has gone on, however, the independence of the Bosnian Serbs has 
grown. Just as Milosevic has easily distinguished his goal of Serb unification 
and expansion from his support for Bosnian Serb leaders, they, as time went, 
have returned the favor. For the Bosnian Serbs, union with Serbia in a 
reconstituted Yugoslavia has remained a goal; support for Milosevic is another 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1992, Milosevic announced that the official Yugoslav army had 
withdrawn from Bosnia, though supply lines remained open and public support by 
Milosevic for Radovan Karadzic, president of one of the two self-declared 
Bosnian Serb states, remained high. However, when the Bosnian Serbs rejected a 
U.N.-sponsored plan for an internal partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Milosevic 
ostentatiously announced that his support for them was at an end. 
</P>
<P>
 There was never any reason to believe that if the Bosnian Serbs had accepted 
the U.N. peace plan either they or the Serbian Serbs would have observed its 
terms: The record of past scorned agreements makes that clear. Nonetheless, the 
Bosnian Serbs clearly departed from Milosevic's script by formally rejecting 
the peace plan. And the result of that rejection has been that U.N.-imposed 
sanctions barring trade with Yugoslavia have remained in place and may even be 
tightened. Milosevic obviously hoped that his well-orchestrated break with 
Karadzic would lead to a quick and complete lifting of the sanctions, but it 
has not had that effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Should it? We do not think so. Five major powers -- Britain, France, the 
United States, Russia and Germany -- are continuing a meeting in Berlin today 
to discuss this question. Russia will demand an immediate end to the sanctions. 
The United States and Germany may well support an easing -- not a complete 
lifting -- of sanctions if Yugoslavia will permit the stationing of 
international monitors along its supply routes to the Bosnian Serbs. Yugoslavia 
has rejected this option unless the monitors can come from the two nations, 
Russia and Greece, that blatantly disregarded the sanctions all along.  
</P>
<P>
 Monitoring by Russians and Greeks may be defended by some as a compromise 
between no monitoring and no change whatever in the sanctions, but this move 
should really be seen as a capitulation. A progressive easing of sanctions 
could be defensible, given strict monitoring and the certainty that any 
violation would lead to immediate reimposition. But the good faith of the 
Yugoslav Serbs is not to be naively presumed. According to widespread reports, 
supplies have continued to flow from Yugoslavia to the Bosnian Serbs, who in 
recent days have returned to large-scale "ethnic cleansing" in northeast Bosnia 
and commenced a shelling of Sarajevo that Tuesday prompted a prudent Pope John 
Paul II to cancel his scheduled visit. 
</P>
<P>
 We believe that President Clinton should, even now, lift the U.S. arms embargo 
on Bosnia-Herzegovina unilaterally. But even those who disagree must recognize, 
at the very least, that any reckless lifting of the Yugoslav economic sanctions 
will make the Bosnian arms embargo virtually impossible to maintain.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WOMAN'S LEG SEVERED AS CAR CRASHES AT REST 
AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Part of a woman's leg was severed when a car crashed into a picnic area at Six 
Flags Magic Mountain, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Emily Robison, 42, an elementary schoolteacher's aide from Bakersfield, was 
sitting at a picnic table in a rest area in the Magic Mountain parking lot 
Monday, said her husband, Allen.They were with about a dozen friends and family 
members who scattered as the car smashed into the table, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I barely got out of the way of the car," he said. "She didn't have time to." 
</P>
<P>
 The car was driven by Geraldine Starkey, 42, of Lakeside, who lost control 
after her boyfriend, Jeremy Zahorik, pushed the vehicle so that the engine 
would start, said Wendy Moore of the California Highway Patrol. She said she 
did not know how fast the car was traveling when it crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Starkey and two other people in the picnic area were also hospitalized with 
injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emily Robison's leg was amputated just below the knee in the accident, and she 
was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia, her husband 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robison said his wife is expected to remain at the hospital for about a week, 
after which her family hopes to bring her home or to a hospital in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Starkey was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills with a broken 
leg, Moore said. Two Bakersfield residents in the picnic area, Pamela Moore, 
39, and Stephen Moore, 12, were treated for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests or citations resulted, but the accident remains under 
investigation, the CHP's Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident is the first in the park's picnic area, and there are no plans to 
close the area as a result, Six Flags spokesman Palmer Moody said.

KINCHEN CUT TO CLEAR SPOT FOR HENLEY; RAMS: RECEIVER ADMITS HE HAS HAD INJURY 
PROBLEMS, BUT SAYS RELEASE WAS DUE IN PART TO HIS SPIRITUAL BELIEFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wide receiver Todd Kinchen, suggesting that his Christian philosophy might 
have damaged his standing with the Rams, was released Tuesday to make room for 
cornerback Darryl Henley, who has been indicted for cocaine possession and 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid paying an additional week's salary, the Rams had to cut Kinchen, who 
was due to earn $375,000 this season, by 1 p.m. Tuesday, although Henley had 
yet to sign a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely enough, the Rams' training staff had cleared Kinchen earlier Tuesday 
to begin practicing today. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a good guy, bad guy thing because we don't even know if Darryl is 
guilty and I don't want to talk about that," Kinchen said. "But it's just the 
way society is going as a whole. Society is losing the good morals, the 
clean-living lifestyle and our boundaries are getting wider and wider." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams say they released Kinchen because they no longer could depend on him 
being healthy and ready to play. Kinchen does not disagree, but he wonders if 
his Christian beliefs made him appear to the team less tough, less committed 
and less willing to come back quickly from his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously they feel they can't continue to invest in somebody who is not 
producing," Kinchen said. "But I find the timing surprising. The injury report 
had me down for a full go to practice, but still they released me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a Christian is what my life is all about and football is a secondary 
thing. That's how I'm able to keep it in focus. A lot of people here have said 
that's part of my problem. They haven't liked the fact that off the field I 
don't come across being a lover of football." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams wondered at times about Kinchen's life off the field, but only 
because he had so much trouble making it to meetings on time. A club official 
said he was fined more than $20,000 his rookie season for being late. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a life off the football field," Kinchen said. "I think people have 
kind of misread that about me being a player, that I haven't loved football as 
much as I really do. It's kind of a shame people don't know me better than 
that. I think Coach (Chuck) Knox is the exception, but people haven't seen my 
football personality enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might have thought I wasn't coming back from the injuries because of 
that, but that's crazy. I wasn't 100% last year, and I was out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said he was aware of Kinchen's religious convictions, but added that 
Kinchen never suggested he was being treated differently. Knox said Kinchen's 
religious convictions had no influence whatsoever in the team's decision not to 
keep him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a numbers situation," Knox said. "While we think he's an outstanding 
talent, we had a hard time keeping him on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinchen, a third-round pick in 1992, tied an NFL record his rookie season 
returning two punts for a touchdown in a game. Pegged to be the team's No. 3 
receiver a year ago, he reported to mini-camp complaining about a knee he had 
injured in an off-season pickup basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Team physicians discovered a cracked bone in his knee and performed surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "This FCA (Fellowship of Christian Athletes) team needed another player for a 
basketball game," Kinchen said. "I've replayed that game over and over in my 
mind, every shot, every jump and I don't remember hurting myself. I just 
remember being sore." 
</P>
<P>
 That basketball game, however, began his downfall with the Rams. Although 
surgery repaired his knee, he returned before he was ready to play, and after 
catching eight passes in five games, he tore a ligament in his other knee. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned this summer, practiced on a limited basis in training camp, and 
appeared to recover fully near the end of the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
 And then he pulled a hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously they don't think I'm worth the patience of waiting one or two 
games," Kinchen said. "I'll go home tonight and think what the hell were the 
coaches thinking today. Of all people -- I'm a very good talent. I got a (sore) 
hamstring, but I'll be ready next week. What the hell were they thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll think about that briefly and then I will throw it out the window because 
there are things in life you can not understand." 
</P>
<P>
 When healthy, Kinchen flashed the speed and receiving ability to make him a 
prime contributor. But can he stay healthy? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a dark cloud overhead, but I've been blessed, too," Kinchen said. 
"You can't allow something like this to drag you down. There are much worse 
things going on; someone probably just died from hunger while we're sitting 
here talking. That's a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 If a team puts in a claim for Kinchen today, they will have to pick up his 
$375,000 salary. More likely he will clear waivers, and have to start trying 
out for teams, while waiting for injuries to take their toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll start at the bottom again, and when I get on a team they'll see I'm a 
good player," Kinchen said. "I'm young, my knee ordeal is over and I know I'm a 
good player. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened today is a disappointment because of the time, the money and 
the patience the coaches have put into me. It's a disappointment because I 
wasn't able to be more dependable than I was. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if I never play in the NFL again, I would have still set an NFL record, 
and that's something most people never do. I have that, and if I never play 
again, I know this: I was a good receiver. It's just God's will."

 Cornerback Darryl Henley reported to Rams Park on Tuesday, met with Coach 
Chuck Knox, but left without signing a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect it to be done," said John Shaw, Ram president."We're just waiting 
for some documents detailing the financial terms (of Henley's $2 million 
bail)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were told they would have those documents at noon Tuesday, but 
Henley's agent, Marvin Demoff, had not delivered the completed paperwork by the 
end of the business day. 
</P>
<P>
 The team would like to have Henley signed today so he can practice in 
preparation for Sunday's game in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley has been indicted for cocaine possession and distribution and awaits a 
January trial. However, he has received permission from the NFL to play, and a 
federal judge ruled he may travel with the team if he, or a responsible third 
party, secures a $2 million bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram officials expressed no alarm at Tuesday's delay in getting Henley's 
signature on a contract. They said they were only being cautious in awaiting 
the arrival of pertinent documents that will allow him to travel. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Knox, who has had a history of quietly helping various charitable efforts, has 
told team officials to take $2,000 raised in fines from players weighing in 
overweight, and direct it toward the feeding of the hungry in Rwanda. T.J.

 Damian Raibon, a 6-foot-4 forward from St. Margaret's High, made an oral 
commitment to San Francisco, St. Margaret's boys' basketball coach Garrett 
Ohara said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Raibon averaged 24 points and 12 rebounds for the Tartans last season. Raibon, 
a Times second-team all-county selection last season, will most likely sign a 
letter of intent with USF during the early signing period in November, Ohara 
said. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

PREP FOOTBALL '94 / SUNSET LEAGUE; A LITTLE MEANS A LOT TO SPUNKY MARINA; 
FOOTBALL: KEIM MUST PLAY A LARGER DEFENSIVE ROLE IN THE VIKINGS' BID TO WIN THE 
LEAGUE.

<P>
 Most fans outside of the Sunset League don't know about Tom Keim, Marina's 
little big man. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 feet 11, 175 pounds, Keim enjoys his anonymity. And if Marina Coach Dave 
Thompson and assistant Larry Doyle have their way, opposing offenses won't be 
able to find Keim this season . . . until it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Keim, a second-team all-league selection at safety last season, has moved to 
linebacker to spearhead the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Keim, who led the team with 81 tackles last season, admitted he wasn't 
completely comfortable with his new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I wasn't too fond of playing linebacker," Keim said. "I wasn't 
positive that I could make the switch, but I've been practicing there for the 
whole off-season, and I think I can handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news for the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a big gamble moving him to linebacker," Doyle said. "He has a skinny 
frame and you might laugh when you look at him knowing he's a linebacker for 
us.  
</P>
<P>
 "But he can find the football and knock people down. I hope we can hide him 
enough so he's able to hold up for a whole season." 
</P>
<P>
 Keim's physique won't intimidate many in the re-aligned Sunset League, 
regarded as one of the county's most physical leagues.  
</P>
<P>
 Linebackers Bill Nix of Fountain Valley (6-3, 220) and Chris Jalandoni (6-1, 
210) of Esperanza, both all-league selections last season, are more typical 
examples of the league's top linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys will look at me and think, 'He might not be much of a challenge,' so 
that actually helps me," Keim said. "But I don't think the size matters at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has always looked at me and said that I'm too small to play 
football. It makes me play harder. I've held up OK and when you've been knocked 
down, you've got to learn how to get right back up." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Keim also enjoyed a solid junior season, college recruiters are not 
beating down his door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't received one letter," Keim said. "But that hasn't bothered me 
either way. I'm happy being able to play and not worry about trying to impress 
people. There's no pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 That low-key profile -- the little team in the big, bad league -- is something 
the Vikings hope will allow them to sneak up on the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need some breaks," Doyle said. "We're not big for the Sunset League, but 
everyone on our defense runs well. Our defense will have to hit-and-run . . . 
hit, get off the block, then run and make the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "But looking at the teams coming into this league, I picked us fifth." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos, which has won three consecutive Southern Section championships, 
joins the league after dominating the Empire League with Esperanza, also a new 
Sunset member. Esperanza tied Los Alamitos for the Division II championship in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 And the three other holdovers from last season's Sunset League -- Huntington 
Beach, Edison and Fountain Valley -- finished ahead of fourth-place Marina, 
which missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to develop an offense that can control the ball and score," Thompson 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The running game could be productive with Josh Cormany (6-2, 270), Richard 
Bustamante (6-0, 285) and Tim Cardona (6-2, 240) paving the way for the running 
backs, including last season's leading rusher, Micah Harrison (87 carries, 469 
yards). 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Mike Williams will add punch after rushing for 990 yards in five 
sophomore games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Keim: "Hopefully, we'll make some noise this season. We've never had the 
size, and we don't have it on defense this year. But we have the heart."

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW; CHANGE IN ALIGNMENT PRODUCES VARYING DEGREES OF 
APPEAL; TRI-VALLEY LEAGUE: SCHOOLS' PROTEST OVER CONFIGURATION PRODUCES 
TENTATIVE DIVISION STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Maybe it is too early to be thinking about playoffs. But why wait until the 
last minute? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Tri-Valley League coaches would like to know. 
</P>
<P>
 With the season's first snap only a day away, members of the five-team league 
must wait until the season's eighth week before learning in which division the 
league's postseason representatives will compete. That's when the Southern 
Section playoff groupings committee is expected to decide whether Tri-Valley 
League qualifiers will enter the Division IX or Division X playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 For coaches, that means holding the phone as far as contacting possible 
playoff opponents about the exchange of game films. At least, until the matter 
is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite a mess," Oak Park Coach Dick Billingsley said. "We usually start 
scouting teams we might play by the third week." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of goofy," Carpinteria Coach Ben Hallock added. "It would be nice 
to know who is in our division so we can keep track of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, the Southern Section proposed playoff groupings for all 
divisions. But the proposal was met with an unexpected number of appeals, 
including one from the Tri-Valley League. The section surveys all leagues for 
their recommendations every four years (every two years prior to 1994) before 
making the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal called for the Tri-Valley League to remain in Division IX. The 
league's appeal requested either dropping to Division X or moving the powerful 
Los Padres League out of Division IX. 
</P>
<P>
 League coaches are not optimistic. "I really don't believe they're going to 
change things," Bishop Diego Coach Norris Fletcher said. "And at this point, I 
really don't care if we play the bigger schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, league coaches will have to wait until a meeting Oct. 20 to find 
out who they will play. That's the soonest the league's appeal can be heard, 
said Bill Clark, Southern Section administrator in charge of football. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 14 appeals to deal with," Clark said. "Historically, we have closure 
on this in the spring. But we've had to meet with everybody and listen to the 
appeals. With 14 appeals, we ran out of time and had to carry it over to this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Tri-Valley officials argue that the average enrollment of its five schools 
(about 600) is closer to the average enrollment of schools in Division X (540) 
than Division IX (875). Moreover, the Tri-Valley League is the smallest in 
Division IX, based on enrollment, and is dwarfed by the Los Padres (1,135) and 
Frontier (1,050) leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, that translates to a tough go come playoff time. And in years 
ahead, the road to the division title likely will include a playoff stop 
against a member from the Los Padres League. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Paso Robles, a member of the Los Padres League with an enrollment 
of more than 1,400, defeated Oak Park, 28-18, in a playoff opener. In 1990, 
Beaumont, a member of the Division IX Skyline League, whipped Oak Park, 34-7, 
in a second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpinteria has enjoyed success in Division IX. The Warriors reached the 
section final five times between 1986 and '91, winning championships in '87, 
'89 and '91. 
</P>
<P>
 But since realignment in 1992 grouped the Tri-Valley and Los Padres leagues 
into the same division, Carpinteria has lost in the playoffs to Paso Robles in 
1992 and Santa Ynez in '93. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carpinteria and Bishop Diego have done OK," Billingsley said. "But most of 
the time, our schools are pretty much handled." 
</P>
<P>
 Billingsley, whose team likely will battle Carpinteria for the league title, 
said he gives approval "a 50-50 chance." 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends," Billingsley said, "on whether they want to listen to us."

TRAVELING A BUMPY ROAD IN SEARCH OF ACCEPTANCE; MOTOR RACING: SIDECAR MOTOCROSS 
RACERS SAY THEY ARE NOT CRAZY. COMPETITORS PREDICT THAT THE SPORT WILL ENJOY A 
REVIVAL IN THE UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It happens whenever members of the Southern California-based Leading Links 
Motorcycle Club roll up to the starting gate at the beginning of a race. 
Uninitiated fans shake their heads in disbelief, muttering something to the 
effect of "Those guys must be crazy, racing sidecars on a motocross track." 
</P>
<P>
 The racers insist that's a bum rap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leading Links, a group of about 30 who take their name from the front 
suspension necessary on sidecar rigs, run a schedule of 12 to 15 races per year 
at tracks in California and Arizona. Sidehacks, as motocross sidecar rigs are 
called, have enjoyed success in Europe for more than 30 years and were popular 
in America between 1978 and 1985 before dwindling interest nearly killed off 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Leading Links, more than half of whom have ties to the area, insist 
the public will respond once again to their off-beat sport. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent California Racing Club event at Los Angeles County Raceway in 
Palmdale, it took less than half-a-lap of a five-lap race to win over the 
crowd. With drivers navigating the hills and bumps and passengers flopping 
themselves strategically in the sidecar to keep the rigs upright, the 
participants resemble a crew of an unstable ship battling tempestuous seas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a crazy hobby? Insurance companies think so. Although race tracks 
routinely find willing insurance companies, the major provider of motocross 
insurance wants no part of the sidehacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen L'Heureux, 23, of Valencia and Scott Gregory, 33, of Canyon Country are 
two recent converts to the sport, catching sidehack fever after watching a race 
in '92 in Adelanto, where Gregory was racing vintage motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 L'Heureux, a technical writer for a defense industry firm and an accomplished 
bicycle racer, had seen sidehacks at Indian Dunes as a child but had no idea 
that the sport was still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 When L'Heureux told Gregory he wanted to be a sidecar passenger, Gregory 
questioned his friend's sanity. But within two weeks, Gregory was looking for 
parts to build a sidehack. A year later, the two became a racing team, albeit a 
rag-tag looking twosome. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors took one look at Gregory and L'Heureux's home-built creation and 
immediately dubbed it "Hackzilla." But in their second start, they earned a 
second-place trophy -- winners earn prize money only at selected events -- and 
became hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole sidehack group is the most enjoyable crowd I've ever run into," 
L'Heureux said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Anders, a 35-year-old engineer from Saugus, and his 52-year-old 
passenger, Paul Stimson, an Oxnard firefighter, are the current points leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Stimson, who has been riding motorcycles for 30 years and surfs nearly every 
day, considers himself an inspiration to the younger riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these guys look at what we do and think it's going to be a piece of 
cake," Stimson said. "Then they get out there, and after one or two laps it's 
all that they can do to hang on, because the passenger's position is so 
important to keeping the machine on course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff shifts gears and turns the bike, while my job is to be where I'm 
supposed to be every second we're out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many passengers, Stimson said a successful team requires strength, 
intelligence and teamwork. Still, passengers have not shaken an unwanted 
nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 "People see us out there and they call us monkeys, yet they don't know 
anything about us, or what we do," said Barry Bryant, a 27-year-old electrician 
from Burbank who has been a passenger on long-time friend David Hersey's rig 
for the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they don't know is that we're all regular guys who have to be at work on 
Monday mornings, just like they do, and we have every intention of going home 
to our families and going to work after the race, just like they do," Bryant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The term "monkey" originated in the early days because the passenger's 
platform resembled a playground-style monkey's playhouse and because the 
sidecar rider's gyrations resemble a monkey climbing a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo's Scott Whitney became a passenger at 13, enlisted into the sport 
by his father. Whitney, who has raced at various times with his father and each 
of his three brothers, including a six-week stint in Europe in 1985, chafes at 
the insanity image. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Our sport) may be a little riskier than driving a car without an air bag," 
he said. "If you are a professional, on a closed course, with proper equipment, 
the risk is minimized." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney reports no broken bones in 20 years of racing, and Bryant asserts that 
he has seen more solo racers injured than sidecar racers in his two years of 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney is not the only racer to get his start with a family member. Mike 
Burns, 30, of Eagle Rock was a passenger on his father's bike as a 9-year-old. 
"That would probably be considered child endangerment these days," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Doherty, 32, of Santa Clarita is another second-generation sidehack 
racer. His father competed in the early '60s, stopping the year his son was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
 Doherty, who works as a movie grip for Warner Brothers, rediscovered the sport 
almost four years ago through his childhood friend Hersey, but didn't start 
competing until 1992. His father declined an invitation to form a team, but 
attends his son's races faithfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Barbacovi, an area motocross promoter for the past 22 years, cites the 
unusual nature of the sport and positive fan reaction as reasons why he tries 
to spur interest. 
</P>
<P>
 He has included sidehacks in his programs since the 1970s, but this year is 
the first time he has promoted them as a separate entity. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is currently scheduled to race in the Viewfinders Grand Prix near 
Castaic Lake in November and the Prospectors Grand Prix in California City in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 The racers urge would-be spectators and participants not to beg off, thinking 
they have temporary insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 "My advice to those who want to get involved is to follow through with your 
initial thought," L'Heureux said. "Don't let it be a passing fancy."

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW; CHANGE IN ALIGNMENT PRODUCES VARYING DEGREES OF 
APPEAL; MISSION LEAGUE: SERRA COACH EXPECTS TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER TEAMS 
MOVING UP TO DIVISION III. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mission League coaches say they're taking quite a step this season with the 
league's move from Division IV to Division III. 
</P>
<P>
 Come playoff time, defending league champion Notre Dame High might find itself 
matched against Ventura instead of Villa Park. Chaminade could take on Royal 
rather than Irvine. And St. Francis, which promises to be much improved in its 
second season under Coach Bill Redell, might be rewarded with a game against 
Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be tougher," Chaminade Coach Rich Lawson said. "We used to play 
easier teams in the playoffs. It'll be a big step up." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's only a small stride compared to the giant leap Serra has taken. For 
first-year Coach Charles Nash, whose team jumped six divisions to join the 
Mission League this season, the step up was a doozy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're telling me," Nash said. "I would have liked to have gone to, maybe, 
Division V or so." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Serra replaces Harvard-Westlake, which, in turn, takes Serra's place 
in the Division IX Camino Real League. The move should favor Harvard-Westlake, 
which last season was 0-5 in league play and was trounced by Notre Dame, 42-3, 
Chaminade, 28-7, and St. Francis, 21-3. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect Serra, a coeducational parochial school with 450 students, to 
take Harvard's place in the Mission League cellar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we'll have our hands full, but we'll be competitive with every team 
in this league," Nash said. "We hope some of them are thinking they're getting 
a doormat. They'll find out soon enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, Serra, a perennial power in divisions VII and IX, not only should be 
sure-footed in its new surroundings. The Cavaliers, some coaches say, are a 
legitimate contender to win the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten starters return for Serra, which finished 7-4 last season and reached the 
second round of the playoffs. Running backs Ricky Boyer and Ademole Turner, who 
teamed on one of the Southern Section's top relay teams, arguably are the 
league's best backfield tandem, if not the fastest. Both are being heavily 
recruited, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've always been good and they've always been dominant in that league," 
Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney said. "We don't really know about them except for 
those fast guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Rooney, whose team has only four returning starters, is the only league coach 
to have battled Serra in recent years. In 1989, Serra defeated Notre Dame, 
10-3, in a Division VII semifinal en route to winning a Southern Section 
championship. Serra exits the Camino Real League after having won eight 
consecutive league titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the playoffs. The first step is getting through the league 
schedule. And getting past Serra. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to have athletes and they're going to be able to win," Lawson 
said. "I think they bring a little more competition into this league." Mission

AGAINST USC, CSUN HOPING TO SUSTAIN ITS MOMENTUM

<P>
 The Cal State Northridge women's volleyball team, winner of the UC Irvine 
tournament over the weekend, will play USC in its first home match of the 
season at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge opened its first season under Coach Lian Kang Lu with victories 
over Fresno State, UC Irvine and Southwest Missouri State in the Irvine 
tournament, but tonight's match against the 15th-ranked Trojans (2-1) is 
expected to be its toughest yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors are 1-15 against USC, including an 0-5 mark since moving to the 
NCAA Division I level in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans opened the season with a 16-14, 15-13, 15-13 victory over Fresno 
State last Thursday, but fifth-ranked Ohio State beat them, 15-12, 15-4, 15-13, 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 USC defeated Loyola Marymount, 15-11, 15-7, 15-10, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Missy Clements, Aimee Stone and Heather Anderson led Northridge in the 
Irvine tournament.

UCI POLL SEES TROUBLE FOR WILSON, HUFFINGTON; POLITICS: GOVERNOR, SENATE 
CANDIDATES BELOW MARGINS NEEDED IN O.C. TO OFFSET DEMOCRAT EDGE IN STATE. 
SUPPORT STRONG FOR IMMIGRANT, CRIME MEASURES.

<P>
 Even though they are leading in Orange County, Gov. Pete Wilson and Republican 
U.S. Senate nominee Mike Huffington face "an uphill fight" here, with voter 
support below the 2-to-1 ratios they would need on Election Day to offset 
Democratic strongholds elsewhere in the state, according to UC Irvine poll 
results released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll showed that Wilson, with 50% support, has failed to increase his 
popularity in this Republican-rich county since the June primary, and that he 
and his Democratic challenger, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, have only "tepid 
support" from local voters. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson, the only good news in the poll is that he is leading Brown in 
Orange County by 18 points among all registered voters (22 points among likely 
voters). 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, meanwhile, is running below the 52% GOP voter registration in 
Orange County, according to the poll conducted by Mark Baldassare, chairman of 
urban and regional planning at the UCI School of Social Ecology, and research 
associate Cheryl Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll showed Huffington, the Santa Barbara congressman, with 49% support, 
compared to 36% for incumbent U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and 11% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good news for Feinstein, who very well may have enough momentum 
statewide to get reelected if Huffington receives less than the majority vote 
in Orange County," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrating that voters this year are more focused on issues than on the 
candidates or political parties, the poll also showed that both Democrats and 
Republicans enthusiastically support two initiatives on the Nov. 8 general 
election dealing with crime and immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 184, the "three strikes" sentencing law for convicted felons, was 
backed by 84% of the voters. Proposition 187, which would deny public services, 
such as education and non-emergency health care, to illegal immigrants received 
a 65% approval rating. Support for Proposition 187 dropped to 54% among 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone poll of 812 registered voters was conducted from Aug. 19 to Aug. 
29 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%. The poll, part of UCI's 
1994 Orange County Annual Survey, was touted as a "special report" on the 
upcoming November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldassare said he was somewhat surprised by Wilson's showing in the poll 
because he expected that the governor would have recovered his standing by now 
after giving up 43% of the Orange County Republican vote to political neophyte 
Ron Unz in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, Wilson is no better off now than he was at this same point 
in the 1990 campaign, and the governor will have to work hard to get the large 
vote margin that he needs in Orange County to offset Democratic strongholds in 
Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tells me he has an uphill fight in Orange County," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
 One out of every five Democrats said they would vote for Wilson, while 13% of 
the Republicans said they would support Brown. Independents were evenly divided 
between the two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Huffington-Feinstein race, each candidate lost one out of every five 
voters to the opposite party, with independents also equally divided between 
both camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous years, independent voters can no longer be expected to vote 
Republican because they are becoming more issues-oriented, Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can partly thank (1992 independent presidential candidate) Ross Perot for 
those trends. He freed up independents and a certain number of voters to view 
both parties with greater skepticism," the pollster said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's a lot of enthusiasm for either gubernatorial candidate 
in Orange County," Baldassare concluded. "That means the outcome of this 
election may very well come down to how the candidates deal with the voters' 
top concerns -- crime and illegal immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that barometer, the Wilson campaign claims an advantage over Brown 
because of her personal objection to the death penalty -- which she has vowed 
to carry out if elected governor -- and her opposition to Proposition 187, the 
anti-illegal immigration measure, on the Nov. 8 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The battleground is slowly shifting for the independent voters and swing 
voters," said Dan Schnur, the Wilson campaign spokesman. "The more they learn 
about the two records, the more they are going to support Pete Wilson. She can 
pretend she's just as tough as Pete Wilson on both of those issues, but when 
push comes to shove and the dust is cleared, she's (former Gov.) Jerry Brown's 
sister and she's against the death penalty and she's against SOS (the so-called 
'Save Our State' initiative)." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur downplayed the UCI poll results, adding that the Wilson campaign's own 
numbers in Orange County show the governor with a slightly higher approval 
rating among "likely voters," and with conservatives providing the foundation 
of the support. 
</P>
<P>
 But by its own action, the Wilson campaign has shown the importance of the 
Orange County vote in the upcoming election. During August alone, Wilson held 
four public events and two fund-raisers here, with his wife, Gayle, also making 
campaign appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why Wilson is having to fight for political territory that would 
normally be the Republican nominee's stronghold, Schnur replied: "These are 
voters with very high expectations. It's very difficult to penetrate the L.A. 
media market -- and the Orange County media market in particular -- from 
Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's campaign, meanwhile, was ecstatic over the UCI poll, even though it 
showed Brown with only 32% support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great news for Kathleen Brown," said John Whitehurst, her campaign 
spokesman. "We are already farther ahead than Feinstein was in 1990." In the 
1990 gubernatorial election, Feinstein took 31% of the Orange County vote while 
Wilson racked up 63%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilson does not have his base intact. His job rating continues to be in the 
toilet; he does not have the support of independents that he had in 1990," 
Whitehurst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing out that Wilson needs 64% support from Orange County voters to 
overcome the expected Democratic lead elsewhere, Whitehurst concluded: "These 
results show that Wilson is in deep trouble in Orange County and in deep 
trouble statewide." 
</P>
<P>
 While crime and immigration continue to be the foremost issues among voters, 
Wilson's embracement of those issues has not directly resulted in increased 
popularity, Whitehurst added. Wilson's Vote Margin 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Gov. Pete Wilson has a wide margin over Democrat Kathleen Brown in 
Orange County, but it may not be enough for him to offset a large Demcratic 
turnout elsewhere in the state. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's edge here may not be enough to cancel the traditional big 
Democratic majorities in Los Angeles and San Francisco counties. In the Senate 
race, Rep. Mike Huffington's lead over incumbent Dianne Feinstein is somewhat

 PROPOSITIONS WIN BIG

<P>
 Two controversial initiatives have widespread support in Orange County. A

 Proposition 187 would make illegal immigrants ineligible for public social

PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ARREST 60 MILITANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a showdown with powerful Muslim fundamentalists, the Palestinian police 
Tuesday arrested more than 60 members of the militant Islamic Jihad in 
connection with a weekend attack on an Israeli army patrol in which one Israeli 
soldier was killed and two were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 In daylong raids throughout the Gaza Strip, special internal security units 
pulled the men from their homes, from cafes and stores, and from several 
mosques that serve as their bases, Palestinian officials said. The sweep was 
the biggest the Palestinian police have carried out. For Palestine Liberation 
Organization leader Yasser Arafat, who ordered the arrests, the roundup was an 
assertion of his authority, a demonstration of his power and willingness to use 
it. It also was a warning to the militants, members of leftist as well as 
Islamic groups, that he will not tolerate further anti-Israeli attacks lest 
they jeopardize the extension of Palestinian self-rule to the occupied West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with stern Israeli warnings that the Palestinian Authority had to act, 
Arafat had little choice, according to Palestinian observers, for not only 
expansion of Palestinian self-government but Palestinian autonomy itself was at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Yossi Beilin, Israel's deputy foreign minister, praised the action as an 
important step toward fulfilling Palestinian obligations under the autonomy 
agreement with Israel and perhaps, in doing so, constituting a turning point in 
the Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the real test will come when Palestinian officials decide whether to 
prosecute those arrested. In the past two months, Palestinian police have 
arrested a number of Islamic militants but released virtually all without 
charge. None has been turned over to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those arrested Tuesday were Sheik Abdullah Shami, 39, the most prominent 
Islamic Jihad leader in Gaza, and Taher Mohammed Lulu, 32, the group's 
principal ideologist. All the Islamic Jihad members were described as having 
been jailed in the past by Israeli military authorities. More arrests are 
expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian police also arrested about 10 members of the radical Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, whose members fired on an Israeli 
settler's car here last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Islamic Jihad had declared that its militia carried out the Sunday night 
ambush of an Israeli patrol guarding Morag, a Jewish settlement of about 70 
people in the southern Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which vehemently opposes the peace agreement between Israel and the 
PLO, declared that the Palestinian leadership "knows perfectly this (roundup) 
of some symbols and supporters of Islamic Jihad will not make the movement 
change its clear strategy to struggle against and to tear out criminal Zionist 
roots from our beloved (Gaza) Strip." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, who has sought to win over the Islamic militants to the peace accord 
without open conflict, had denounced the continuing attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know we are against it," Arafat said Monday. "We are in search of these 
people who are trying to act against the security of the whole area. . . . They 
are getting their orders from outside Palestine, from far away." 
</P>
<P>
 Brig. Gen. Ghazi Jabali of the police said that a man arrested earlier had 
also been linked to the killing and would be prosecuted. Israeli sources said a 
Palestinian injured in the shootout had led police to some of the Islamic Jihad 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned Arafat this week that the 
continuing attacks were endangering the peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The absence of firm and effective action by the Palestinian Authority to halt 
the terror of the extremists opposed to the peace process will create problems 
on Israel's part in continuing the agreement," Rabin said following Sunday's 
attack. Although such attacks have been less numerous than anticipated by 
Israeli security specialists when the agreement was signed, Rabin said the 
militants were "nearing the limit" of what Israel could tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not making any effort to deal with these terror groups," he told 
Israel Television on Tuesday. "In the future, if this continues, it raises a 
big question about the ability to continue with the implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles signed in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin was referring to the accord on Palestinian autonomy, signed at the White 
House on Sept. 13, 1993, that set a timetable for self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin complained that the Palestinian police have done nothing to track down 
two Muslim fundamentalists suspected of killing two Israeli construction 
workers near Tel Aviv last month. Israel has given the Palestinian police the 
names of the two suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Israelis have been killed and 12 injured in attacks in the Gaza Strip 
since the Palestinian Authority assumed control in May.

ABORTION ACCORD GAINS SUPPORT; POPULATION: COMPROMISE AT U.N. CONFERENCE CALLS 
ON NATIONS TO DEAL WITH RISKS OF PROCEDURE BUT DOESN'T PROMOTE IT AS FAMILY 
PLANNING TOOL. VATICAN IS HOLDOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nations of the world rallied Tuesday around a compromise on abortion at 
the population conference here, lending substantial support to a measure 
calling for governments to deal forthrightly with the health risks of illegal 
abortion while not promoting the procedure as a family planning tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Legalization of abortion would be up to each nation to decide for itself under 
an emerging compromise that won substantial endorsement in principle from 
members of the U.N. committee seeking to finalize a new, 20-year plan for 
global population. The measure won support from nations as diverse as Pakistan 
and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Vatican dashed all hope of a unanimous agreement Tuesday night when it 
opposed the compromise language, and the drafting committee delayed a final 
decision pending new deliberations this morning, when Nicaragua and several 
other Latin American states are scheduled to weigh in. 
</P>
<P>
 Most conference officials predicted the abortion amendment would finally be 
agreed on over the objections of the Roman Catholic Church, which has opposed 
all global population plans over the past 20 years. But delegates were clearly 
frustrated that the Holy See had failed to sign on to the carefully drawn 
abortion provisions, designed to avert the church's fears of creating an 
international right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with other compromises nearly complete on adolescent sexuality and 
non-traditional relationships, conference officials said they were well on the 
way to overcoming some of the most divisive issues on world population. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a powerful movement on the chapter . . . related to abortion, and a 
strong consensus. There was an overwhelming number of countries who said (the 
compromise paragraph) as it appears in the draft was the basis for the 
consensus," a Clinton Administration official said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The paragraph no longer contains a reference to "sexual health education" or a 
plea to governments to review their abortion laws and policies. And a call to 
consider women's health "rather than relying on criminal codes and punitive 
measures" was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore appeared to reach agreement with the Vatican on the 
issue of adolescent sexuality after meeting with the Holy See's chief delegate, 
said Timothy E. Wirth, U.S. undersecretary of state for global affairs and head 
of the U.S. delegation to the conference. Wirth reported that the Vatican 
representative called the latest compromise under discussion "a concluded 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration official said the proposed compromise draws on language from 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which notes the role and right of 
parents in providing guidance to adolescents in matters of reproductive health. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore also clarified with the Vatican proposed language on non-traditional 
families, which the church feared could be seen as an endorsement of homosexual 
relationships. The clarifications preserve the original intent, which was to 
satisfy the request from several Caribbean and African nations to sanction 
relationships such as common-law marriage that are outside the scope of 
traditional marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The first important signs of an overall agreement came early in the day when 
Benin, Malta and Ivory Coast, which earlier had backed the Vatican's opposition 
to the abortion provisions, signed on to the compromise along with several 
Muslim states. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when an informal working group met to finalize the details, 10 
additional nations, including Norway and Pakistan, endorsed the wording. 
Norway, with one of the most liberal abortion policies in the world, has 
endorsed worldwide decriminalization of abortion, while Pakistan, a 
predominantly Muslim nation, has shared the Islamic bloc's reservations on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus their endorsement was seen as something of a bellwether, indicating the 
Vatican may be left nearly alone in its opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holy See, in an official statement issued earlier in the day, reiterated 
its stand against abortion and artificial contraception, which has fueled much 
of the controversy behind the 1994 International Conference on Population and 
Development. The conference proposes to curb Earth's growth explosion by aiming 
for a global population of 7.2 billion in 20 years. There are currently 5.6 
billion people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican acknowledged that the draft plan contains "many positive points," 
lauding its focus on education and health care services for women and children. 
But it said the church could not give "explicit or implicit support to those 
points of the document regarding abortion, the weakening of several 
family-related terminologies, the effective encouragement among adolescents of 
a liberal sexual lifestyle free of parental rights, with no reference to 
ethical values -- all of which in the long term can only bring damage to 
individuals and society." 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Holy See implied it was prepared to quietly agree to disagree 
on the issue of contraception as long as it is specifically stated that family 
planning programs do not include abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal voices also expressed reservations about the emerging compromise, 
arguing that it does not go far enough to protect women against the dangers of 
unsafe illegal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still view it as a compromise," said Jacqueline Jackson, chairwoman of the 
International Planned Parenthood Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Planned Parenthood, which operates family planning clinics around the 
world and sits as an observer at this week's U.N. meeting, was of the view that 
the abortion language as it was emerging Tuesday does not provide enough focus 
on women, does not adequately address the quality of care for women, is not 
"proactive enough" and still provides "the opportunity for people to view 
abortion as a legal issue, rather than a health care issue." 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said most opposition to the abortion issue had been overcome even 
from Muslim nations, many of which had initially shared the Vatican's concerns. 
Most Islamic scholars have ruled abortion illegal except to protect the health 
of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of countries felt there still needed to be some work, but as of this 
morning, the majority of countries were supporting the alternate language 
replacement," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative language under discussion, which still could be revised 
somewhat during refinement talks, contains these elements: 
</P>
<P>
 * In no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning. 
</P>
<P>
 * All governments and non-governmental organizations are urged to deal openly 
and forthrightly with unsafe abortion as a major public health concern. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given the highest 
priority, and all attempts should be made to eliminate the need for abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 * In circumstances in which abortion is legal, women who wish to terminate 
their pregnancies should have ready access to reliable information and 
compassionate counseling, and such abortion should be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Any measures to provide for safe and legal abortion within the health system 
can only be determined at the national level through policy changes and 
legislative processes that reflect the diversity of views on the issue of 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Several nations were still lobbying Tuesday night for minor wording changes, 
additions and deletions, some as conditions for signatures on the final 
document. For example, some want to say abortion should not be "encouraged" as 
a method of family planning, rather than "promoted." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. delegation had suggested providing post-abortion family planning 
counseling and education services to prevent repeat abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 Wirth, in a meeting with reporters, reiterated the U.S. position that abortion 
should be "safe, legal and rare."

SINN FEIN LEADER, IRISH PREMIER IN 1ST MEETING; ULSTER: HISTORIC TALKS FOCUS ON 
IRA CEASE-FIRE. LONDON PARLEY BETWEEN MAJOR, PROTESTANT MILITANT ENDS IN ANGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gerry Adams, the militant republican leader, had an unprecedented meeting 
Tuesday with Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds in Dublin to discuss the 
current cease-fire of the Irish Republican Army. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time a head of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA, had 
ever met with an Irish prime minister, and the contact provoked expressions of 
outrage among Protestant unionists. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, which John Hume, a Northern Irish Roman Catholic moderate, 
also attended, the participants said they believed the cease-fire announced 
last Wednesday by the IRA will continue to hold. The three also committed 
themselves to resolving the 25-year sectarian war in Northern Ireland by 
peaceful means. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds defended his meeting with Adams, at which he shook the former 
revolutionary's hand, by declaring that no time should be wasted in maintaining 
the momentum toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, insisting that the current peace is holding, asked in the meeting that 
the British "demilitarize" Northern Ireland by removing some or all of their 
17,000 troops on duty in the province. 
</P>
<P>
 As the two were conferring in the Irish capital, Protestant militant Ian 
Paisley saw British Prime Minister John Major at No. 10 Downing St. in London 
-- but the meeting broke up in unusually rancorous terms after only a few 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Paisley, a member of the British Parliament who leads the hard-line Democratic 
Unionist Party, insisted on reading to Major a series of questions concerning 
the cease-fire -- and the British position on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Major asked Paisley whether he believed the British government's assertions 
that it had not made a secret peace deal with the IRA. When Paisley refused to 
answer, the prime minister dismissed him, suggesting he was not welcome at No. 
10 unless he could accept Major's word. 
</P>
<P>
 Paisley told reporters afterward that Major told him: "I'll never talk to you 
again until you declare your belief that I speak the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Major insisted that he would abide by the language of the Downing Street 
Declaration, which he and Reynolds signed in December, calling for all-party 
talks on a settlement in Northern Ireland after a three-month cease-fire by the 
IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord says that the future of Northern Ireland will be determined by a 
majority of voters inside the province -- a majority that is currently formed 
by the 57% Protestant unionists, who want to remain under British rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Major's treatment of Paisley is sure to unsettle the Protestant militants in 
Ulster, the Protestants' favored word for Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Paisley, like more moderate unionists, has been suspicious of the IRA 
cease-fire, believing that secret promises have been made to the Irish 
republican militants that could compromise the unionists' hold on the province. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are leery of any contacts between Britain, the Irish government and 
the IRA before a three-month cease-fire period is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, David Trimble, deputy leader of the moderate Ulster Unionist 
Party, said the Dublin conference was held in "indecent, obscene haste." 
</P>
<P>
 The British government, worried that it does not have a firm enough commitment 
to a "permanent" cessation of violence by the IRA, has been cautious about 
contacts with Sinn Fein. Reynolds opened a gap between Dublin and London on 
this issue by meeting with Adams on Tuesday but defended his act, saying: "Why 
so soon? It is never too soon to save a life." 
</P>
<P>
 When an opportunity exists, negotiators must take advantage of it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, for his part, called the Dublin meeting a "historic day, the beginning 
of a new era." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Major needed to "grasp this opportunity" for peace and not stand on 
ceremony or worry that the word "permanent" was not mentioned in last 
Wednesday's cease-fire statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRA has observed the armistice since the cease-fire was declared, but the 
Protestant Ulster Volunteer Force, an outlawed paramilitary group, admitted 
killing one Northern Ireland Catholic man and exploding a bomb in front of the 
Sinn Fein press office in West Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams has said the IRA would not retaliate and instead hold to its promise of 
an indefinite cease-fire.

SAFETY CONCERNS FORCE POPE TO CALL OFF SARAJEVO TRIP; BOSNIA: A TERSE VATICAN 
STATEMENT CITES WORRIES ABOUT CAPITAL'S RESIDENTS. PONTIFF FINALLY GAVE IN TO 
ADVISERS. 
</P>

<P>
 It started with papal resolve to carry an offering of peace and reconciliation 
to a city racked by war. But the gesture quickly lapsed into a nasty game of 
brinkmanship, and on Tuesday it was Pope John Paul II who blinked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be with you," the Pope promised the people of tortured Sarajevo 
earlier this year. "We will be ever more with you." 
</P>
<P>
 But only in spirit. A prayed-for one-day papal visit to the battle-scarred 
Bosnian capital scheduled for Thursday died aborning Tuesday: too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 A terse Vatican statement Tuesday night said the Pope had called off the trip 
because of his concern for the safety of the residents of Sarajevo. It was the 
same reason given for scrapping a planned visit last spring to Lebanon, another 
vortex of ethnic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's statement said the Pope had always insisted on "sufficient 
guarantees for the safety of the population" but that "unfortunately so far 
there aren't such guarantees, despite numerous contacts with all sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Abandonment pleased the Bosnian Serbs, who vigorously opposed the trip, and 
came as welcome relief to beleaguered U.N. forces, who persuasively insisted 
that they could not guarantee the safety of the pontiff or the crowds he would 
draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Duels between Muslim and Serbian gunners drowned out the hammers of carpenters 
building an altar at a Sarajevo ice rink Tuesday afternoon as John Paul met 
with key aides at the papal summer retreat of Castel Gandolfo south of Rome. 
There were almost continuous artillery exchanges around Sarajevo airport, and 
two relief flights were hit by small-arms fire, U.N. officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Sebastien Pasquier, a spokesman for U.N. peacekeepers, said Serbs on 
Monday fired on French peacekeepers protecting the airport, possibly in an 
attempt to intimidate U.N. troops prior to the Pope's scheduled visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The mounting violence strengthened fears that even a brief visit by the Pope 
could trigger a blood bath. In recent days, Vatican sources said the Pope 
stubbornly rebuffed don't-go advice that flooded him with rare unanimity from 
officials of his Curia, members of his household and lifelong friends visiting 
from Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 Clerics who had made their careers saying yes to one of the world's last 
authoritarian rulers suddenly found themselves pleading with an obstinate 
pontiff to scrap Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 To no avail. Since the city fell hostage to ethnic slaughter 29 months ago, 
John Paul has developed an abiding preoccupation with Sarajevo, praying 
publicly and repeatedly for a city ravaged by the "ferocity of people who have 
forgotten their humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul had hoped to visit local dignitaries, pray at the cathedral and say 
a public Mass in a Bosnian echo of pastoral visits he has made to more than 100 
countries worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not coming despite the danger, he is coming because of it," Bishop Pero 
Sudar had told the city's 30,000 minority Roman Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, the 74-year-old pontiff, still limping from a broken hip, told 
worshipers at Castel Gandolfo: "I truly hope, if there are sufficient 
guarantees for the security of the local population, to be able to go to that 
city which has been battered -- and which is so dear to me -- as a pilgrim of 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put this trip in the hands of the Virgin Mother and ask her to ensure that 
all goes ahead without danger to the population," the pontiff added. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, tension has ratcheted up almost hourly: sniping, artillery 
exchanges, the inconclusive rustle of diplomats, Bosnian Serb officials saying 
privately the visit would be "highly undesirable" and U.N. officers saying 
anonymously that the Pope would be risking his life, that of everybody around 
him, and that of the faithful who came to see him. 
</P>
<P>
 Days ago the Vatican was convinced to postpone the trip. Only the Pope held 
out, Vatican sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 While he delayed a final decision, preparations continued. People in Sarajevo 
risked snipers to clean streets, hang up banners, paint the podium. The 
Popemobile went to Sarajevo by military aircraft Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Vatican, officials scrambled to accommodate worsening conditions. The 
visit would not be nine hours, but four or five. The Mass would not be outside 
but in. The Pope would not take that route but another; riding inside an 
armored vehicle perhaps. No schedule was ever announced because none could be 
assured. 
</P>
<P>
 Papal trips are normally scripted to the last psalm months in advance, but 
Sarajevo suddenly became free-form. Vatican reporters accustomed to traveling 
with the Pope, most of them eminent Italians of a certain age, were told to 
make their own arrangements for Sarajevo via U.N. flights from Ancona on 
Italy's Adriatic coast. Thus did dozens fearlessly venture forth, balding pates 
firmly notched in blue helmets, eminent paunches stuffed inside U.N.-demanded 
flak jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday afternoon, John Paul reluctantly surrendered, a decision he will 
probably explain at a public audience for pilgrims in St. Peter's Square today.

COLUMN ONE; IRAQ'S PLAN: FAITH, HOPE AND DEALS; AS SANCTIONS' BITE DEEPENS, 
BAGHDAD OFFERS TRADE PACTS AND USES RELIGION TO SEND A MESSAGE -- LIFT THE 
EMBARGO OR RISK MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALISM. FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE WORLD SEEMS

 It will rise from a lake formed by the waters of the immortal Tigris River, a 
huge, white dome suspended among eight rocket-like minarets. To be built on one 
of the airports bombed by the United States during the Persian Gulf War, it 
looks like a floating space station. 
</P>
<P>
 Its destination: paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, we flew out of this airport to visit the world in jet planes. 
Tomorrow, we will fly from this place on a journey the modern jet cannot reach. 
It is a journey of the soul to its creator," say the architects of "A Mosque 
That Floats On Water," envisioned as the largest mosque on Earth and Saddam 
Hussein's rocket ship to destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iraqi president drew the design himself and two months ago imposed a ban 
on private building, to free materials for the imminent seven-year construction 
of the mosque and other government projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In Iraq, struggling under the most severe international economic sanctions in 
modern history -- sanctions whose bite after four years is beginning to draw 
blood -- a grand new mosque would seem an odd investment in a future well 
beyond the reach of United Nations resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Baghdad's message to the world these days -- as its envoys jet around the 
globe offering compromise, cooperation and even the unusual prospect of Iraq 
joining the Middle East peace process with Israel -- comes with a subtle 
reminder. The Iraqi president, who has outlasted an American president 
(children play hopscotch on George Bush's grimacing tile face on the floor of 
the Rashid Hotel), a British prime minister and countless other allied leaders, 
may be demolishing his missiles and drawing in his belt, but he still has the 
God card -- and the world's second-largest oil reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 All over the Iraqi capital, billboards portray the president in full military 
dress, kneeling on a prayer rug with his hands raised in supplication. 
Government television breaks for prayers five times a day and features long 
lectures by religious sheiks. In recent weeks, public alcohol sales have been 
banned, and the government has implemented strict Islamic punishments -- for 
thieves sentences range from hand amputations to death for repeat offenders -- 
specified in the holy Koran. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral is only too clear: Lift the embargo and Iraq is more ready to be a 
player than at any time since its disastrous invasion of Kuwait four years ago. 
Leave it and risk pushing Iraq, for years a wall against the march of radical 
Islam from neighboring Iran, into the arms of Muslim fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a carefully calculated strategy in a country where the rise of any 
opposition, religious or secular, is quickly quashed. But for the first time, 
and perhaps for reasons of its own, the world seems ready to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade delegations -- from France, Canada, Britain, Switzerland, Italy, 
Germany, Brazil, Austria, Turkey, Asia, all over the world -- are flooding into 
Baghdad at the rate of two a month. Even U.S. companies, banned by American law 
from any business dealings in Baghdad, are sending feelers, drawn by the lure 
of multibillion-dollar deals Iraq is offering for signature now to those who 
support lifting the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The memoranda of agreement, some of which are worth $1 billion each, according 
to the Iraqi trade minister, will bind Iraq to signing contracts once the 
sanctions are lifted. U.S. companies, he said, are bidding for a share of Iraqi 
business through European or Middle Eastern branches to get around the U.S. 
trade ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last month, Jordan and Turkey joined in a public call for immediate 
lifting of the embargo -- whose effects have ravaged their own economies -- and 
France, China and Russia, a majority of the permanent members of the U.N. 
Security Council, are leaning toward a review of Iraq's case. Then, Turkey 
quietly reopened its border with northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day or another, these sanctions will go," Iraq's information minister, 
Hamad Youssef Hammadi, said in an interview. "Because there is a lot of 
pressure now on the American Administration. The American Administration does 
not want to admit failure, but it is cornered." 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq, whose senior diplomats have spent the last several weeks on a whirlwind 
tour of Arab, European and Asian capitals, has emerged confident that the back 
of the embargo will be broken by spring: if not by Security Council action, 
then by simple non-observance, like water pouring over a shaky dam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if it comes to the worst case, a vote in the Security Council, and the 
U.S. uses the veto, the others will not comply. Politically, maybe. But not 
technically," Hammadi said. "If the U.S. uses the veto, the British or the 
French or the Russians will say, 'This embargo is not a council action, it is 
an American action.' They will deal with Iraq, even if there is an American 
boycott." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has repeatedly expressed opposition to any easing of the 
sanctions, noting that Iraq still has not accepted its border with Kuwait, nor 
has it eased its human rights violations, especially against Shiite Muslims in 
the south, who are seeing their villages burned and their leaders arrested in a 
government campaign to wipe out the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, U.S. officials ask why the sanctions should be lifted just when they 
are beginning to work. America's ambassador to the U.N., Madeleine Albright, 
has repeatedly expressed fears that Iraq will simply resume its building of 
illegal weapons once the embargo is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the sudden rush of international economic interest in Iraq, it is 
hard to find anyone outside the United States and Britain, which has supported 
the U.S. stand though somewhat less enthusiastically, who seriously disagrees 
with Iraq's upbeat expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saddam now, even though his circles are drawn in much closer and tighter, is 
probably more secure than he's been in the last three years," said one Western 
diplomat. "These sanctions tend to be more and more of an American policy. 
They're a knee-jerk reaction where it makes it look to the domestic 
constituency like Washington is doing something, but they really don't achieve 
their intended purpose. . . . There's no way you can keep down for long a 
country of 18 million people with the second-largest oil reserves on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all its bravado, Baghdad is a wounded capital. And the rest of the 
country is even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The planning minister was fired recently after he officially estimated annual 
inflation at 24,000%, but the reality is that the Iraqi dinar only four years 
ago bought $3. Now, $1 is worth more than 600 dinars, and about 7 million 
Baghdadis who live on fixed incomes are trying to make it on their old 
salaries. A typical schoolteacher can buy two chickens with his or her monthly 
earnings. An engineer can buy a tray of 30 eggs and have 25 dinars left over. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has kept the country alive by offering a ration package of 
rice, flour, oil, sugar, tea, soap, toothpaste, baby formula, razor blades and 
matches to every family for next to nothing. But beyond this subsistence, life 
becomes impossible for all but the rich who can buy on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers, disgusted with low government price supports, quit growing tomatoes; 
they disappeared from the market until two weeks ago, when subsidies were 
raised. So did potatoes. Cucumbers are a rare delicacy except in well-to-do 
homes and luxury hotels, where for $200 a night, foreign guests must plead for 
toilet paper, sugar and milk for tea (poured out grudgingly and then snatched 
away). 
</P>
<P>
 Butter? No. The vinaigrette the menu advertises with the seasonal salad? No. 
Tomatoes for the salad? No. Aspirin? Sorry. A telephone call to neighboring 
Jordan? Possibly tomorrow. To Egypt? No. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the international sanctions allow food and medicine to be shipped 
freely into Iraq. Yet with billions of dollars frozen in overseas bank accounts 
and no way of selling its oil, the government says it doesn't have enough money 
to buy food and medicine. The ration program alone is costing about $1 billion 
a year. Foreign diplomats say Iraq undoubtedly has billions of dollars in 
hidden assets it could still tap, but even those, many say, appear to be 
draining -- or the government is simply choosing not to spend them. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, life in Baghdad is a depressing grind for almost everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friday morning flea market downtown has stretched to cover an entire 
street and two adjacent thoroughfares. Old trousers, china dug out from the 
dining room, mixers, sunglasses and old telephones cover the makeshift stalls 
-- anything anybody found in a closet to help buy food for the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Hadija Jamaam sits grimly on the sidewalk, leaning on the family television 
set. It is the only thing the family has to sell. "I don't have any money. If I 
had money, I wouldn't sell my TV set," she says. "I have eight children; what 
can we do? We eat tomatoes (when they are available) and bread. Please, can't 
someone break these sanctions and tell people that we are suffering?" But then 
she sighs. "God will help," she predicts. "God will never leave his Muslim 
believers in such a situation for long." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Qadissiyah Hospital in Saddam City -- a suburb to which many residents 
fled after two wars in Basra -- 10-year-old Rana Naji lies on a dirty bed in 
the emergency room, her eyes rolled back into her head. She has been 
unconscious for more than a day, and her mother sits hunched on the floor 
beside her bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was eating lunch yesterday and fainted for no reason. She hasn't woken up 
since," said the woman, Sadia Kata. "She was eating rice and salt, nothing 
more. The doctors have seen her and think there is blood poisoning, but there 
is no medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Iraqi officials estimate that the child mortality rate has quadrupled since 
the sanctions began in August, 1990, with about 400,000 children dead of 
malnutrition and disease. An estimated 12,300 Iraqis have died in the past two 
months as a result of food and medicine shortages, including 9,434 children 
younger than 5 who were victims of diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition-related 
diseases, according to a Health Ministry report issued last month. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no way of verifying the government's claims, but a visit to the 
Qadissiyah Hospital pharmacy is telling. Its entire stock on a recent day 
consisted of a plastic tray divided into sections, several of them empty. 
Today, there is medicine for nausea and treatment of dust allergies and a few 
other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two vials of hydrocortisone. There is no medicine for other 
allergies, asthma, diarrhea or nerves. (The Valium disappears fast). There are 
no antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daily we face many difficulties in our duties toward the patient, from the 
door of the hospital to this room, and day after day, the difficulties 
increase," said Dr. Nassir Zubaydi, head of the cardiac care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the charts for any of these patients, you will see a 
prescription and the notation, 'Drug is absent.' We force ourselves to change 
the types of medication, and instead of using the best or the second best, we 
use the fourth or the fifth best. The site of humanity is the hospital, but we 
find ourselves in a position to do nothing for them, and finally we discharge 
them to die." 
</P>
<P>
 The city is becoming more dangerous. The crime rate has doubled since the end 
of the Gulf War, and not only among the populace. The government recently had 
to rein in the secret police, who were conducting random house searches and 
seizing whatever caught their fancy. Police and officials of the ruling Baath 
Party were visiting shop owners, seeking protection money. New punishments 
under Islamic law imposing death on repeat robbers have encouraged some thieves 
to simply slaughter all witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few months ago, something started happening we couldn't understand," said a 
young Baghdad mother. "A child, anywhere from 3 to 6, would be kidnaped, and 
then someone would call and say, 'If you want your child back, bring 10,000 
dinars to this place.' They would go to the place with the money, and they 
would find only a bag, with a string on top. Inside it would be the child's 
head, his legs, his arms. This happened three or four times." 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnapers didn't show up for the money? "No," she said, shaking her head. 
Why not? She shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 In times like these, is it any wonder that more people are going to the 
mosques? That more women are wearing Islamic head scarves? That fundamentalist 
groups such as the Shiite Al Dawaa, and even a few Saudi-sponsored Wahabi 
Islamic groups, are again being heard from? 
</P>
<P>
 The government's overwhelmingly pious response over the past two months is 
officially designated the National Religious Belief Campaign. Privately, 
officials admit that its basics -- banning public consumption of alcohol, 
adopting Sharia (Islamic law) punishments (four thieving hands were amputated 
in the past month), displaying Hussein in various postures of worship, the 
Grand State Mosque -- are intended to nip in the bud any wave of Islamic 
fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The National Religious Belief Campaign concentrates on the main concepts of 
religious belief, but not on the fundamentalism. This has made both sects (of 
Iraqi Muslims) surprised, because they cannot understand this campaign, which 
concentrates not on the political concepts, but on the concepts of belief," 
said a senior Iraqi official. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts here believe the new religious campaign is very much political 
and that its audience is as much the international community as the Muslims of 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're using it both as propaganda and leverage," said one foreign diplomat. 
"See what sanctions are doing to us? We are coming closer and closer to 
fundamentalism. Cornering us, you will achieve another Iran." 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker of Iraq's Parliament, Saadi Mahdi Saleh, said encouraging religion 
in Iraq is a way of feeding the public's patience and readiness for sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hard or difficult circumstances make man seek God's help," he said. "You in 
the West are driving the region toward this kind of practice, because when 
unjust pressure is put upon societies, those societies cannot answer back the 
way they would like to, and then they will go to God and pray. When unjust 
pressure comes, religion becomes stronger, and as a conclusion it would end up 
declaring jihad against those who are practicing these unjust deeds."

RUSSIA LIVID OVER ALLEGED SPYING BY U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The former KGB is mad as hell about aggressive Western spying on Russia and 
its patience is running out, says an article in the official Russian government 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual article, which was published in Saturday's editions of Rossiskaya 
Gazeta and was written by a senior Russian counterintelligence official, names 
three U.S. diplomats whom Russia accuses of spying. 
</P>
<P>
 It alleges that Malibu-based Pepperdine University collected Russian defense 
industry secrets under cover of a U.S. government-funded program to encourage 
defense conversion. And it charges that the CIA has stepped up recruitment of 
Russian citizens with the goal of penetrating and undermining Russia's 
military-industrial complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The author, Col. Sergei G. Gorlenko of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service, hinted Tuesday that expulsions of U.S. diplomats from Russia may be 
forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview in his office in the KGB successor agency's Lubyanka 
headquarters, under a portrait of the founder of the Soviet secret police, 
Gorlenko said the counterintelligence service has extensive information "about 
not-quite-diplomatic activities of the U.S. diplomats I mentioned in my story 
and some others too." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working hard and we have a lot of facts, believe me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorlenko, 45, said he joined the KGB in 1971, and was a longtime operative 
before joining the public relations department of the KGB successor agency. He 
said he and his superiors decided to publish the article now because the 
hemorrhage of defense secrets has become "intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA and other U.S. agencies, as well as private American companies, "will 
use any means to obtain the last remaining secrets of the Russian 
military-industrial complex," Gorlenko said. "We are losing everything. We are 
losing our economic and military potential." 
</P>
<P>
 The attack took U.S. officials by surprise. Relations with Russia seemed to 
have stabilized in the wake of the Aldrich H. Ames spying case, which led to 
tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats in February. On Sunday, U.S. and Russian 
troops began their first joint peacekeeping exercises in the Russian heartland, 
at the Totsk military base in the Ural Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Russian officials have never stopped grumbling about Western 
spying. In July, the director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, 
Sergei V. Stepashin, said that Russia was especially concerned about spying by 
North Korea and the United States and that he had raised the issue with U.S. 
Ambassador to Russia Thomas Pickering. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Embassy spokespersons refused to comment on the article, or on any 
complaints made to Pickering, in keeping with their policy never to discuss 
intelligence matters. In Washington, the State Department said it had no 
comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the three U.S. diplomats named have already left Moscow. Gorlenko 
charges that Donald Gibson Plants, who worked in the embassy's environment, 
science and technology section before leaving sometime this summer, was a 
"career intelligence officer" who tried to ferret out Russian military secrets 
under the cover of working on defense conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 The article also names Kelly Ann Hamilton, a former third secretary at the 
embassy, who departed Moscow at least a year ago. Hamilton has been accused in 
other Russian press articles of encouraging Russian informants who offered to 
provide details of the latest, top-secret Russian T-82 tank manufactured in the 
city of Nizhny Tagil. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named is a "vice consul of the U.S. General Consulate in St. Petersburg 
Geoffrey Giles," but no such person is included on the U.S. diplomatic list in 
Moscow or St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
 "The article sounds like a combination of some possible truths mixed with a 
big dose of paranoia," said Washington-based espionage expert Jeffrey T. 
Richelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the CIA office in Moscow is still operating, but I'd be suspicious 
of calling Pepperdine University questionnaires a cover for espionage," 
Richelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas P. Kemp, who heads the Pepperdine University Russian Conversion 
Program, called the spying charges "nonsense" and "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, funded by $1.7 million in grants from the U.S. Agency for 
International Development, has brought about 80 Russian defense plant 
executives to America over the past two years, Kemp said. It offers management 
training, helps develop a peacetime business plan for converting defense 
industries, introduces Russian executives to potential American business 
partners, and even tries to help them get start-up capital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's a great program and are absolutely dumbfounded by the notion 
that it is some secret plot," Kemp said. "I thought the Cold War was over." 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the Cold War has not diminished the West's desire for reliable 
information about the status of Russia's still-giant nuclear arsenal and its 
troubled nuclear research facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the recent plutonium-smuggling cases, and the potential for nuclear 
materials from the former Soviet Union to fall into the hands of terrorists, 
the United States has every motive for trying to plumb Russia's nuclear 
secrets, Richelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you could recruit an agent in MinAtom (the Russian atomic energy 
ministry), no government in its right mind would say no," Richelson said. "It's 
too much of a threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorlenko said that last year, the counterintelligence agency nabbed about 20 
Russian citizens who were spying for the West, and has exposed five more agents 
so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the surveillance continues to cut both ways. Earlier this month, 
Sweden filed a formal protest after learning that Russia had harbored and 
employed an escaped Swedish spy as recently as one year ago.

DIRECTOR CREDITED WITH REVIVING CHILDREN'S AGENCY; SOCIAL WORK: PETER DIGRE HAS 
IMPROVED RESPONSIVENESS AND RECORD-KEEPING. BUT HE HAS A LONG WAY TO GO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The call came to the county child-abuse hot line from a neighbor concerned 
about the sound of a wailing baby. Something in her gut said the child was in 
trouble, and she didn't know what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the call probably would have been given a low priority, 
meaning that it might have been as long as 10 days before it was checked out. 
Even today, that is probably how it would be handled in other counties that 
adhere to the state's minimum guidelines for so-called low priority cases. 
</P>
<P>
 But ever since Peter Digre took over as director of the Los Angeles County 
Department of Children's Services in 1991 -- when the agency was on the brink 
of oblivion and under pressure from the state to shape up or shut down -- all 
hot-line calls concerning children 4 or younger must be investigated before the 
end of a social worker's shift. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, that policy may well have saved the infant's life. A social 
worker and a police officer went to the house and found the child stuffed into 
a plastic bag, hidden behind a couch, but still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how many kids we save" with the more aggressive policies, said 
Bill Garcia, who runs the hot line. "We'll never know. But the director says, 
"How do you know nothing is going on until you go out and see the child? " 
</P>
<P>
 Basic concepts such as that have been at the heart of Digre's increasingly 
successful efforts to transform the county agency from a laggard to a leader 
and from an embarrassing liability into a source of pride. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old administrator, known as a passionate advocate for children, 
said the philosophy underlying his agenda is simple: 
</P>
<P>
 Foster kids need to see doctors, and records should be kept of their ailments 
as well as their immunizations and checkups. They should have school records. 
When they turn 18 and leave the system, they ought to have a place to live and 
a means of support. Kids should not be sent to live with relatives who are 
habitual criminals or child abusers. And parents ought to know what it will 
take to have their children come home. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Pete's sake," Digre said, using a characteristic phrase, "we're the only 
parent some of these kids have, and it's really crucial that we are following 
up on what they need." 
</P>
<P>
 Those procedures were being followed only sporadically when he arrived from 
Florida, where he was deputy secretary of the state's Department of Health and 
Rehabilitative Services, but are now standard practice. Robert L. Chaffee, 
Digre's predecessor in the agency that serves 50,000 abused and neglected 
children a month, was a social services administrator who had never been a 
children's social worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made some real substantial steps in the right direction," Digre said. 
"But we've got a lot to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Making the job more difficult has been an explosion in the demand for the 
agency's services, brought about in part by an increase in the welfare rolls of 
a million cases over the past four years. Because poverty contributes to 
neglect, the number of child-abuse cases rose by nearly a quarter from 1992 to 
1993. A large percentage involved homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in abuse has led to a shortage of foster and group homes, causing 
social workers, many of whom are still saddled with overwhelming caseloads, to 
question how much progress has truly occurred during Digre's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Digre said the job has been easier than he expected, largely because 
of the help that he has gotten from unions, the county Board of Supervisors and 
the county Commission on Children's Services in lobbying for funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Peter came on board we . . . finally got a professional with the 
background and experience and passion for doing the job he was hired to do -- 
help abused children, help families, and find a way to serve them better," said 
Nancy Daly, a longtime member of the commission, which monitors the 
department's performance and played a key role in forcing Chaffee's departure 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't solved the problems that are out there," she said, "but we have 
the kind of leadership we were looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Los Angeles is home to 35% to 40% of the state's foster children, 
whatever it does in caring for youngsters gets attention. Now Digre and his 
ideas are gaining influence as well, said Eloise Anderson, the director of the 
state Department of Social Services, the agency that four years ago threatened 
to take over the county department. "I listen to him because he's very 
instrumental in the state," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Anderson cited Digre's creation of an ombudsman's office to 
investigate complaints, and the unique approach he has brought to the 
department's efforts to preserve families and head off abuse through such 
services as drug treatment, day care, housing assistance and parenting classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Using mostly nonprofit and private agencies, the relatively new programs have 
achieved a 20% reduction in the number of children removed from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's positive . . . is that there is a vision for this agency and there was 
not before," said Carole Shauffer, a San Francisco lawyer who in 1988 helped 
file the widely known "Timothy J" class-action lawsuit against the department 
to force it to visit children in its care more often. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of fighting against the agency, Shauffer is working with it to improve 
services for children. She recently assisted the department in developing a 
"bill of rights" to give children assigned to long-term group homes more 
control over their circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the department has shown an openness to change on behalf of children 
and their families. "They've gone from being last in the state to being people 
that the state looks at as innovators." 
</P>
<P>
 Digre's reputation for innovation has spread beyond Los Angeles and the state. 
Last month, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's wife, Matilda, a children's advocate, 
took a daylong tour of the agency's facilities with Digre for a firsthand look 
at the department's turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems facing Digre when he arrived went back to the agency's creation 
in 1984, when children's advocates convinced the county Board of Supervisors 
that an independent agency could serve children better. But independence did 
not come easily, and Chaffee, who had been with the county welfare department, 
took over in 1985 to take care of such simple problems as paying bills on time 
and arranging for enough desks and office supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Digre's task, according to one administrator, has been to take the 
bureaucratic shell and furnish it with the elements of a functional 
child-welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the department's failure to respond when a child was in imminent 
danger topped the list of 27 shortcomings cited in the state's 1990 notice of 
noncompliance with its standards. Now, internal audits show, social workers 
comply with the rules 96% of the time. Such statistics caused the dark cloud of 
state oversight to be lifted in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Rino Patti, the dean of USC's School of Social Work, has worked closely with 
Digre and admires the progress that he has made. Still, he said, much more 
remains to be done. "It's one thing to say that you have visited so many 
families on a timely basis, but it's another thing to say that you're doing 
something good for them." 
</P>
<P>
 It is more likely that social workers will accomplish something positive if 
they have more time, said Phil Ansell, an official with the social workers 
union. He said caseloads as high as 80 or 90 per worker were one of the most 
important causes of the agency's past failures. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, the agency will pass an important milestone when it completes the 
hiring of about 300 new social workers, enabling the agency for the first time 
in its 10-year history to measure up to state "yardsticks" for manageable 
caseloads -- generally about 40. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Ansell said, "we're light years ahead of where we were" and 
"children are getting better service and protection." 
</P>
<P>
 To secure the resources necessary to pursue what he sees as his obligation to 
provide more services, Digre spends several days each month in Sacramento and 
Washington hunting down funds, including some for which the county had not 
previously applied. State and federal programs provide nearly 90% of his 
agency's $800-million budget, which is up by $300 million since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work the federal titles every way we can," Digre said. "It's like a 
football player dodging tacklers; we have dozens of options to try. My job is 
to get the resources to the staff to take care of the kids, and I'm going to 
keep on pushing." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after he started, he persuaded the state to apply for a federal program 
never before used in California to set up a training consortium linking the 
department to social work schools at USC, UCLA and Cal State Long Beach. Now in 
its third year, the consortium has a $5.4-million annual budget to provide 
classes for department veterans as well as eight weeks of training for all 
newly hired social workers. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar consortium is being set up to serve other children's departments in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 One view of Digre's impact can be seen at the hot line, which receives an 
average of 14,500 reports of child abuse or neglect a month from police 
officers, teachers, doctors and concerned citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, when he arrived, hot-line operators wrote out the details of abuse 
allegations by hand, while computers gathered dust on their desks. They asked 
callers only nine basic questions and faxed often illegible reports to outlying 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the hot line, like the department, is more businesslike: The computers 
are running, meaning that taking a report is quicker and the result is more 
readable. The operators ask a list of questions that fill seven computer 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
 And each worker has a list of 17 "mandatories" that require an immediate 
visit. For example, a social worker must visit every baby born with drugs in 
its system before its release from the hospital. In other counties, social 
workers visit the family's home days later to find out if the mother is still 
using drugs and breast-feeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, it was left to our discretion, but now it is codified," said John 
Riggles, a licensed psychotherapist who takes calls on the hot line. "I feel 
real positive about it. In the past, where I would want to make it an 
'immediate response' case, my supervisors would say, 'It's not that dangerous' 
and overrule me." 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers at the hot line, and elsewhere in the department, said Digre is 
obsessed with paperwork and record-keeping to ensure compliance with his 
policies. Indeed, the department conducts monthly and bimonthly audits to make 
sure that visits are being made and criminal background checks are being done. 
</P>
<P>
 And some of the agency's more than 2,500 social workers said middle managers 
use the audits to terrorize workers into working faster. "There's an 'I'll get 
you mentality,' " said Arlene Thomas, who was an emergency response worker 
attached to the hot line before she quit recently. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the years of disarray and the demands of the cases have left many of 
the agency's social workers burned out and ineffective. Although Digre's "heart 
is in the right place," she said, "the children are still not being attended to 
the way they should be." 
</P>
<P>
 Some foster parents said the department has not been supportive and is now 
trying to take away funds that are paid to them to take care of children with 
special needs. 
</P>
<P>
 It is "difficult to find out how extensive these problems are," said Margarita 
Mendez, who chairs the children's services commission. "There have been good 
specialized programs developed, but I'm not so sure what is happening with the 
core of the kids, the ones that get once-a-month visits and who see four social 
workers at the beginning of the process." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, Digre is open to hearing about such issues. "I can go in and 
complain and he listens and he tries to change things." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she and others said, the agency is huge, one of the country's largest, 
and it's going to take time to turn it around. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a little change, however, is refreshing, said Beverly Muench, a deputy 
director of the department who was responsible for preparing the corrective 
action plan that got the state to give up its control last year. In the past, 
she said, she was ashamed to admit that she worked at the agency. Now, she's 
proud. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've finally mastered the basics," she said. "We've got a long way to go, 
but we're headed in the right direction." Measuring Improvement 
</P>
<P>
 Since Gerald Peter Digre, a career social worker and administrator, became 
director of the Los Angeles Department of Children's Services in 1991, the 
agency's budget has increased to about $800 million and the number of 
children's social workers has gone up by 550. Calls of abuse and neglect to the 
agency's hot line have increased to 14,500 per month. Here are some other 
indicators of change the agency has reported: 03,41,09,08 1991 1994 Child abuse 
allegations investigated 68% 96% in a timely manner Compliance with state rules 
74% 95% covering foster child visitations Compliance with 54 state 26% 92%

MEXICAN FIRM'S DIRECTOR A FUGITIVE IN BANK SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN and CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This nation's fast-expanding private banking industry was rocked Tuesday when 
the government seized Mexico's fifth-largest financial group and issued an 
arrest warrant for its dynamic chairman, Carlos Cabal Peniche. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second scandal to hit Mexico's recently privatized investment 
houses in three months, and officials said it might imperil a major deal 
involving California-based Del Monte Foods Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabal, 38, a cutting-edge symbol of Mexico's new generation of 1990s-style 
entrepreneurs, was widely suspected to have left the country. 
</P>
<P>
 He and several directors of Mexico City-based Grupo Financiero Union 
masterminded a self-lending scheme that siphoned assets from the group's two 
major banks "with the sole purpose of making resources available to Mr. Cabal 
Peniche," Finance Minister Pedro Aspe Armella asserted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The government made no official statement on Cabal's whereabouts. But late 
Tuesday, the attorney general's office announced that it had arrested nine key 
officers of the group and its subsidiaries and that Cabal was not among them. 
The Mexican judiciary confirmed that Cabal and three key directors were still 
at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican Treasury officials said at a news conference Tuesday that National 
Banking Commission investigators documented the funneling of at least $200 
million from assets of the group's Banco Union and Banca Cremi via "grave 
irregularities" to provide Cabal with "resources from the bank to acquire 
shares of various companies." 
</P>
<P>
 One senior official estimated that the alleged fraud ultimately could run up 
to $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabal is considered one of Mexico's wealthiest industrialists, with far-flung 
interests in agriculture, timber, newspapers and hotels in addition to the two 
banks. But controversy has sometimes followed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabal was touched by the BCCI bank scandal when it became known that he had 
repaid a $60-million loan from a Bank of Credit and Commerce International 
affiliate with $30 million in cash and stock from one of his companies. In 
June, a Cabal spokesman denied reports that he was being investigated by the 
Manhattan district attorney's office for his BCCI involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with his father's lumber, farming and retail businesses based in his 
native Merida in the Yucatan Peninsula, Cabal over the past 15 years built an 
empire that encompassed two of Mexico's largest banks, vast agricultural 
operations and a piece of the Camino Real luxury hotel chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior government official indicated that the action against Cabal and his 
group probably would affect their plans to buy Del Monte Foods of San 
Francisco, one of the world's leading processors of fruits and vegetables, with 
$1.6 billion in sales and 13,500 employees worldwide. The attempted purchase 
was seen at the time as a bid to exploit the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabal and a group of international investors were to pay $277 million in cash 
and assume almost $700 million worth of Del Monte's debt under the deal, which 
wasn't completed. A Del Monte spokeswoman declined comment Tuesday except to 
say the company will for the time being remain the possession of its owners, an 
investment partnership headed by Merrill Lynch and Citicorp. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Cabal acquired a different entity, Del Monte Fresh Produce of Coral 
Gables, Fla., for $500 million. Del Monte Fresh Produce is the world's largest 
pineapple grower and third-largest banana producer. The firm has 400 U.S. 
employees and grows cantaloupe and honeydew melons in California. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Del Monte Fresh Produce in Coral Gables said the events in 
Mexico had caught the company by surprise but that it was conducting business 
as usual. Both Del Monte units were once parts of the RJR Nabisco conglomerate 
sold off piecemeal after the company's $25-billion management buyout in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's developments, Mexico's second major investment scandal in three 
months, were briefly noted by this nation's volatile investment markets, but 
after an early drop the Mexican stock exchange finished the day up 38 points, 
or 1.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a generalized situation. I doubt that these practices have been 
followed by the rest of the big Mexican banks," said Jose A. Garcia-Cantera, 
Latin American bank analyst with Salomon Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia-Cantera said he expects the government to sell the banks to a Mexican 
group, an international buyer or to the previous owners of Banca Cremi. Aspe 
late Tuesday confirmed that the government will try this. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading in Banca Cremi, Mexico's fourth-largest bank and Grupo Financiero 
Union's only publicly traded subsidiary, was suspended at the start of business 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, which launched a bold program to privatize the banking 
industry three years ago under the radical economic reform policies of 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, had sought to minimize the effect of its 
move against Grupo Financiero Union from the moment it made the action public 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the seizure of the two banks and the group's six other major 
financial subsidiaries, and the judicial arrest warrants for Cabal and three 
other leading directors, Finance Minister Aspe said he was taking extreme 
action to protect investors, shareholders and depositors. 
</P>
<P>
 He also stressed that Grupo Financiero was the only institution in which 
government investigators had uncovered such serious irregularities after an 
exhaustive audit of the banking sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a consequence (of the seizure), savers, depositors and creditors of Banca 
Cremi and Banco Union will not suffer a loss," Aspe declared in his brief 
statement Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the group will now be administered, under government supervision, by 
Carlos Aguilar Villalobos, general accountant of the nation's second-largest 
financial group, Grupo Financiero Bancomer. 
</P>
<P>
 This is similar to the arrangement the government made in late May, when it 
seized Grupo Havre amid official charges that the financial group had 
improperly altered its books and provided false information to Treasury 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking administrative control of Havre, Treasury officials reported 
uncovering more irregularities, similar to those discovered at Grupo Financiero 
Union. Regulators specifically cited its advancing under-collateralized loans 
to "ghost" companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday the senior Treasury official on the government team overseeing 
the privatizing of the banking and investment industries made it clear the 
government was determined to prosecute Cabal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabal's whereabouts were unknown Tuesday. There were widespread reports that 
he had fled Mexico, and Treasury officials said that, if that were true, they 
would try to extradite him to answer charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Fineman reported from Mexico City, Kraul from San Diego.

SUSPECTS IN CROSS-COUNTRY SERIES OF KILLINGS SEIZED IN NEW MEXICO; CRIME: 
POLICE FIND THE TWO ASLEEP IN A CULVERT NEAR SANTA FE. THEY ARE SUSPECTED OF 
MURDERING FOUR PEOPLE IN THREE STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HAEDERLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two suspects in a weeklong odyssey of murder and robbery were captured in the 
desert near Santa Fe, N.M., Tuesday morning, 1,500 miles from home. 
</P>
<P>
 State police officers, acting on a tip from a local man, surprised Lewis 
Gilbert, 22, and Eric Elliot, 16, as they slept in a concrete culvert not far 
from the city's airport. Two rifles, a shotgun and a handgun lay nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The two did not resist the half-dozen arresting officers, state Police Lt. 
David Osuna said. Soon afterward, a search helicopter found a silver Dodge 
pickup similar to one taken from an Oklahoma woman who was shot to death 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert and Elliot, both of Newcomerstown, Ohio, are suspected of killing four 
people in Ohio, Missouri and Oklahoma, in each case stealing their vehicles to 
travel to the next crime. 
</P>
<P>
 They were charged in U.S. District Court Tuesday with unlawful flight to avoid 
prosecution, based on criminal counts of kidnaping and aggravated burglary 
filed in Ohio. Unlawful-flight charges typically are used as a device to hold a 
suspect until state charges are filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday afternoon, each suspect appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Lorenzo 
Garcia in Albuquerque. Elliot's hearing was closed because he is a juvenile; 
Gilbert appeared in a packed courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a black T-shirt, black jeans and basketball shoes, he appeared 
sunburned, tired and disheveled, his wavy blond hair matted. Speaking in a low 
voice, Gilbert said he understood the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Garcia asked whether Gilbert wanted to have an attorney appointed for 
him, he answered, "No, sir." Garcia said he would not allow Gilbert to waive 
his right to an attorney without first discussing the matter with a 
court-appointed attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing to decide whether probable cause exists to hold the pair 
is scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an affidavit filed in federal court by Peter A. Christ, an FBI 
special agent in Canton, Ohio, the crime rampage began with the abduction Aug. 
29 of Ruth Lucille Loader from her Port Washington, Ohio, home. Loader, who was 
79 and recovering from cancer surgery, has not been seen since. Her 1980 Buick 
Skylark was found last Wednesday near Fulton, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Christ said Elliot reportedly had been seen at a truck stop about a mile from 
where Loader's car was found. The next day, the bodies of William Brewer, 86, 
and his wife, Flossie, 76, were found in their home 150 yards from where 
Loader's car ended up. Each had been shot three times, and their 1981 
Oldsmobile Cutlass was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, agents learned, Elliot and Gilbert had turned up at the home of 
Gilbert's mother, Yvonne Rowan, in Tahlequah, Okla., driving a car similar to 
the Brewers'. The pair told Rowan that the car belonged to a friend and that 
they were headed to California, Texas or Florida. They left Rowan's home Friday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, police found the body of Roxie Ruddel, a 37-year-old security 
guard, at a marina near Oklahoma City. Her pickup truck had been stolen. The 
Brewers' Oldsmobile was found nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspecting that Gilbert and Elliot were headed to California, where Elliot's 
mother lives, police issued a nationwide alert. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two people called the New Mexico State Police on Tuesday morning to 
report encounters with the pair. One, a man from Lamy, N.M., a small town about 
12 miles southeast of Santa Fe, said two men drove to his home Monday afternoon 
and asked for gasoline. He gave it to them, but became suspicious after talking 
to co-workers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The other caller, a Santa Fe man, said he had given the pair a lift into town 
Monday evening, then returned them to where their pickup truck was stuck in an 
arroyo near the Santa Fe Downs racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Within half an hour, officers converging on the area found and arrested 
Gilbert and Elliot. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot's stepmother, Judy Elliot, said in a telephone interview Tuesday that 
reports of the crimes were a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't believe it," she said. "We feel it's a nightmare going on. We don't 
think he committed any of the murders. We believe he was forced to go with this 
guy."

QUAKE READINESS STUDY RAISES CONCERNS; EMERGENCIES: POLL OF VOTERS FINDS THAT 
MANY WERE UNSURE WHICH SAFETY MEASURE TO TAKE FIRST DURING A MAJOR TEMBLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A survey of 600 California voters conducted for the state Office of Emergency 
Services indicates that a majority do not know what safety step to take first 
during a big earthquake and that 31% believe it is useless to prepare for a 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The director of the office, the state's principal disaster agency, expressed 
concern at the findings Monday, saying that every study has shown that death 
and injury can be minimized if people make preparations and act properly once a 
quake begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Richard Andrews said he was particularly concerned by a finding that 
only 19% of those surveyed -- when asked what they would do first if a quake 
struck -- answered that they would get under a table, while 40% said they would 
get in a doorway and 11% would run outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the doorway is often considered the strongest part of a room, a more 
effective action is to 'duck, cover and hold' under the nearest sturdy table or 
desk," Andrews said. "Despite what about 1 in 10 survey respondents believe, 
running outside during an earthquake is not advisable." 
</P>
<P>
 When the question was narrowed to give respondents a choice between a table, a 
door and going outside, 57% chose the table, indicating that when prompted to 
think more about it, most people came to the right answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the survey by Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin & Associates included only 
voters, the sample was not representative of the state's population. For 
instance, only about 8% of the respondents were Latino while the state's 
population is about 25% Latino. A survey that only includes voters also 
frequently understates the numbers of poor and young. 
</P>
<P>
 An emergency services spokesman, Tom Mullins, said that to save money, the 
poll questions were tacked onto a political survey of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those surveyed, 17% said they believed that the next major earthquake would 
occur in their area in the next year, 27% said in the next one to five years 
and 11% in the next six to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% said they were not that worried about earthquakes, while 30% said 
they were somewhat worried, 5% very worried and 4% extremely worried, while 1% 
said they didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found that 70% said they had been through a major earthquake, while 
30% said they had not. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that many people keep safety equipment close by in case a 
quake strikes. For instance, 96% said they had a working flashlight, 92% had a 
portable radio, 85% had extra batteries, 84% had a wrench to turn off the gas, 
70% kept shoes next to the bed while they slept, 67% had a well-stocked first 
aid kit, and 64% had a charged fire extinguisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, 55% said they had a week's supply of food for their pets.

ON CALIFORNIA: A SEASONAL RITE: SNIPING FROM THE GUTTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greetings from the California suburbs, where your correspondent spent Labor 
Day weekend roofside, engaged in the hopeful and melancholy task of cleaning 
rain gutters. Hopeful because to muck out a rain gutter is to ignore the 
empirical truth that California has entered a new Dry Age. Melancholy because 
this is a seasonal rite, an acknowledgment that another summer has sprinted by, 
and soon will come the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 It occurred to me, dangling over the roof edge, elbow deep in gunk, that a 
good Californian probably would let the gutters go this year. Nature does have 
a perverse streak. It's possible a clogged rain gutter -- not unlike a freshly 
washed car -- might somehow trigger a downpour. Like most good thinking, 
unfortunately, this mild brainstorm came too late. I already was on the roof -- 
committed, as they say, to the task. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing like cleaning out a rain gutter to draw the attention of 
neighbors. "Good for you!" they shout up heartily from the street. "Need to do 
that myself!" What they say is not what they mean. Life in suburbia is full of 
subtext -- go reread your John Cheever -- and these cheery expressions masked 
darker sentiments, like: 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks, jerk. For making us look bad. For laying on the guilt trip. Now, to 
keep up, we'll spend next Saturday hanging upside down, getting ready for rains 
that won't come . Thanks. Jerk.  
</P>
<P>
 At least this is how I preferred to interpret the Saturday salutations. Up 
there on the roof. Dangling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Certain chores aside, fall is my favorite season. Perhaps this comes from 
growing up in Fresno, where it meant harvest festivals and Pop Warner football 
and the sweet smell of scalped lawns covered with steer manure. In California, 
autumn cannot be marked by temperature or turning leaves. True, there's a faint 
dew on the grass, and the palm trees shed, but mainly fall arrives as a change 
in light. The bleach is rinsed from the sky. The afternoon sunlight turns 
almost amber. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what the almanac says, fall begins over Labor Day weekend -- an 
observance as relevant as rain gutters. Let us celebrate our working men and 
working women. Whose real wages have been frozen since the 1960s. Whose union 
membership has declined to something like 10%. Whose CEOs bound into corporate 
headquarters every day with a glint in their eye and a red pen in their pocket: 
How many jobs can I whack today, ho ho? Just how vertical can this economy get? 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, like most American holidays, Labor Day is about shopping. The 
gimmicks are fall fashion and back to school, and never mind that for most 
California kids the flannel season runs about two weeks, sometime in January. 
My own daughter was taken shopping for school clothes last weekend. She picked 
out a raincoat at the Gap. It was marked down to $3.99. The free market 
economy, like nature, can be a wondrous mechanism to behold. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Labor Day served as the traditional start of the political 
season. This, too, is an outdated concept. The guns of politics have been 
roaring full bore across California since July. The major candidates have spent 
a bundle on television ads. So far, the collective strategy behind their 
eye-poppingly negative spots has been simply to get voters to start paying 
attention. So all right, we are listening. Now, dear politicians, do you have 
anything meaningful to say? Hello? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One seasonal sound is absent this September. With baseball gone, Vin Scully's 
distinctive voice no longer resonates across Southern California backyards. 
This, many of my Los Angeles friends have observed, is about the only thing 
they miss as a result of the baseball strike. Otherwise, the baseball blackout 
has been perfectly enjoyable, like a late afternoon nap. There are simply too 
many sports. We needed a break. 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, now there is football again, and later this fall the O.J. 
Simpson trial. Television sets everywhere are snapping back to life. The 
political candidates are concerned about the Simpson case. They fear 
Californians won't concentrate properly on the campaign rhetoric. Imagine that. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it occurred to me this weekend, while on the roof, that this 
political fretting is exactly backward. For the O.J. trial has the potential to 
produce what every advertiser, campaigns included, should want -- a huge and 
captive audience. Thus, the smart politician might consider gouging the moneyed 
interests now for sufficient contributions to secure live air time at every 
trial break: That was riveting testimony on genetic fingerprints, folks, and it 
reminds me of my views on family values . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I liked that idea on Saturday a lot more than I do now. Could it be that 
dangling upside down from a roof is bad for the brain? Next fall I don't think 
I should risk it. Next fall I should just let those rain gutters go. Hello?

L.A. GAINS CONCESSION ON ANTI-SMOG RULES; POLLUTION: AQMD PROPOSES TO REMOVE 
STRINGENT MEASURES FOR AIRPLANES, TRUCKS, TRAINS AND SHIPS FROM PLAN TO BE 
SUBMITTED TO U.S. ACTION IS DESIGNED TO BUY TIME TO SEEK MORE ECONOMICAL 
ALTERNATIVES. 
</P>

<P>
 In a major concession to Los Angeles, regional air quality officials devised a 
proposal Tuesday that would remove stringent anti-smog measures for airplanes, 
trucks, trains and ships from a sweeping clean-air plan to be submitted to the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal presented by Henry Wedaa, chairman of the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District, the expensive and highly controversial measures 
targeting diesel engines would remain in the Los Angeles region's 20-year smog 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But they would not be included in the version sent to the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency for approval, which means the AQMD is not committing to 
implement them. That flexibility would give the AQMD and the city of Los 
Angeles a few more years to search for more economical alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher O'Donnell, a city legislative analyst, endorsed the compromise, 
calling it "the best way to expedite the issue at this time." While it would 
allow Southern California to meet a federal deadline for its smog plan, the 
compromise would not commit the area to measures that would have "a disastrous 
impact on the region's economy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD board will meet Friday to decide the fate of the sweeping smog plan. 
Last month, the board unanimously postponed a decision until then so that an 
eleventh-hour strategy by Mayor Richard Riordan's staff could be hastily 
analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD plan, designed to meet health standards in Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties by 2010, includes more than 100 proposed 
transportation and industrial measures. It is the AQMD's third update, required 
under federal law, in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Friday, the AQMD board will tackle an extraordinary proposal from 
local elected officials at the Southern California Assn. of Governments. The 
group has recommended that the AQMD incorporate in its plan a tax on motorists 
that would amount to 3 to 5 cents per mile driven -- equivalent to about $1 per 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Sherwood, SCAG director of forecasting, said the tax would have to be 
set by the Legislature and would replace current gasoline taxes that amount to 
about 2.5 cents per mile. He said it would bring in about $5 billion a year to 
fund mass transit and other transportation improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa, however, predicted Tuesday that his board would never push for such a 
tax and that "it's obvious that the Legislature would never do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the proposed compromise strategy with the mayor is much less 
aggressive in reducing nitrogen oxides, a pollutant mostly from diesel-powered 
vehicles that contributes to the basin's notorious ozone pollution, its brown 
haze and its particulates, which are small pieces of carbon soot and dust that 
lodge in lungs and cause respiratory disease. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake are measures that would eliminate about 270 tons of nitrogen oxides, 
or NOx, each day. Under the mayor's strategy, 50% of NOx would be removed from 
the region's air -- or 540 tons a day -- compared to 79% under the AQMD's 
original plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the city wants much less stringent rules for the region's 
airports, trains, ships and heavy-duty trucks. The trucking and airline 
industries have been vocal opponents of the rules, saying they would be forced 
to slash flights and the hauling of goods to and from the region. Riordan and 
local business leaders say the measures would drive up costs so much that 
shippers and other interstate commerce would move business to other major 
cities and ports such as Seattle and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Implementing the AQMD's entire plan would cost business and consumers in the 
four counties $5.4 billion a year through 2010, according to the AQMD's 
economic report. The mayor's office says its strategy could cut that loss by 
$3.2 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members have suggested that instead of tough controls on the urban 
transportation sources, particulates could be tackled in future years by 
looking for additional ways to eliminate natural dust that blows into the air 
from unpaved roads and lots, particularly in San Bernardino County. That has 
upset many Inland Empire officials, who say that Los Angeles is trying to shift 
the burden of controlling particulates to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Wedaa's strategy, the AQMD would promise to the federal government that 
it would reduce enough NOx to achieve federal standards for ozone, the main 
ingredient of smog. But it would take up to two more years allowed under 
federal law to come up with additional measures to tackle particulates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're probably just delaying the pain," Wedaa said in an interview. "But 
we're doing it because we have a lack of upfront information. I object to 
strong rules until we know more." 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa said he will convene two conferences of experts to try to devise more 
economical ways to reduce particulates. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Wallerstein, AQMD deputy executive officer, originally was opposed to 
the mayor's strategy. But he said Tuesday that deferring the diesel proposals 
in the version submitted to the EPA will not harm public health because they 
will remain in the AQMD's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists disagree. They say that without a commitment to the EPA, 
the measures would carry no weight and would be put on the back burner by the 
AQMD as well as by the EPA, which is to formulate its own backup clean-air plan 
for the region by February. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's real motivation was to send something less aggressive to the EPA," 
said Denny Zane of the Coalition for Clean Air. "Now there won't be a strong 
target for the EPA." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's aides, however, say the AQMD plan is unworkable, since it relies on 
technology for clean-burning heavy-duty engines that is yet to be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 State Air Resources Board staff members agree. ARB officials said there is no 
current way to eliminate three-quarters of the NOx in the basin by 2010, as the 
AQMD proposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clean Air Act, the AQMD and state board have until Nov. 15 to submit 
a final plan to the EPA that outlines how the Southland will meet health 
standards for ozone, the main ingredient of smog. If the deadline is missed, 
the EPA could impose sanctions on the region next year, including a freeze on 
federal highway funds and bans on new polluting businesses.

SUIT SEEKS TO REDIRECT USE OF TOBACCO TAX; HEALTH: PLAINTIFFS SAY MONEY 
INTENDED FOR SMOKING RESEARCH AND EDUCATION WAS ILLEGALLY DIVERTED TO BALANCE 
THE STATE BUDGET. THE WILSON ADMINISTRATION CONTENDS THE FUNDS WERE ALLOTTED 
PROPERLY.

 Charging that the governor and Legislature illegally diverted $129 million 
intended for tobacco research and education programs in order to balance the 
state budget, the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Assn. filed 
suit Tuesday to restore the money to its original purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 The two nonprofit health groups, joined in their suit by four legislators and 
four private citizens, contended that legislative leaders and Gov. Pete Wilson 
"in a back room deal" violated the terms of Proposition 99, the anti-smoking 
ballot measure that raised the tax on a pack of cigarettes by 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 That 1988 initiative specified that 20% of the added revenues go to 
anti-smoking education efforts and 5% to research on tobacco-related disease. 
</P>
<P>
 But in order to fill a $5-billion gap that was facing the state this year, 
Wilson and the lawmakers cut deeply into the Proposition 99 programs to pay for 
a variety of health programs for California's poor, including health checkups 
for youngsters, examinations for pregnant women and infants and medical 
services for physically handicapped children and those with inherited diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit particularly hard was the special tobacco research account, which provides 
funding for research into smoking-related diseases and for studies of ways to 
prevent or stop smoking. The budget deal provided $8 million for research over 
the next two years while diverting $56 million to health care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Sacramento County Superior Court, asks that the state's top 
financial officers -- Wilson, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Controller 
Gray Davis -- be ordered immediately to halt all payments from research and 
health education accounts for health care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is whether the legislators and the governor are above the law and 
can appropriate taxpayers' monies to purposes to which they were never 
intended," said Paul Knepprath, a spokesman for the American Lung Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, two other groups, the Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights and 
Say No to Tobacco Dough, asked the court to return $166 million in cigarette 
tax money they claim was illegally diverted to health care programs in earlier 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's press secretary, Sean Walsh, contended that the Proposition 99 money 
has been appropriated properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento), who wrote the bill that divided 
up the Proposition 99 tobacco tax revenue, argued that the use of money was 
permissible. 
</P>
<P>
 Isenberg agreed that the last-minute compromise could be characterized as a 
political "back room deal." But he argued that the divvying up of the tobacco 
tax revenues was a political compromise from the time the initiative's various 
sponsors -- including health groups, doctors, hospitals and environmentalists 
-- "first sat down and said, 'Let's raise the tax on cigarettes,' and decided 
how the money should be spent." 
</P>
<P>
 Isenberg pointed out that at no time was all the added tobacco tax revenue 
targeted for anti-smoking purposes. The proposition, for example, provided for 
5% for wildlife habitat protection. 
</P>
<P>
 But the health groups that filed suit contend that the Legislature cannot 
tamper with the 5% set aside for research and the 20% for anti-smoking 
education. The groups say that the budget compromise provides only 0.8% for 
research and 13% for education. 
</P>
<P>
 Knepprath said that the parties to the suit would push for a speedy resolution 
of the case but said any action would require a full-fledged court hearing. 
"It's unclear how quickly the courts will be able to act on this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the shrinkage in spending on education and research programs has 
already had an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Local health officials throughout the state have been forced to cut back on 
education programs aimed at discouraging smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact on the scientific research has been even more dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been tremendous damage in the continuing delay in funding for 
important research," said Charles L. Gruder, director of the University of 
California's Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program. Under Gruder, the 
university has established an elaborate system for evaluating and funding 
Proposition 99 grants to public and private research facilities throughout the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes tremendous time and energy to launch research projects and sustain 
them," Gruder said. Uncertainty about funding for tobacco research will 
inevitably force the best researchers in the field to consider directing their 
work to other areas, he said. "The whole idea of Proposition 99 is to redirect 
attention to smoking-related disease. . . . If the money is so ephemeral, if 
there's no permanence at all, they may go on to study other things." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those researchers is Dr. David Burns, a lung specialist at UC San 
Diego. Burns has been conducting a detailed statistical study designed to 
determine why some smokers develop lung cancer and others do not. African 
American smokers are 50% more likely to die of lung cancer than are white 
smokers, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns argues that uncovering the reason behind those differences may provide a 
new understanding not only of lung cancer but of how cancer develops in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Proposition 99 research cut has brought a halt to the $85,000-a-year 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns has already been forced to lay off the full-time statistician who was 
working with him on the project. If it is ever funded again he will have to 
find and train someone new, which could take several months. 
</P>
<P>
 And Burns' own university salary was partly paid for by the state grant. He 
must now look for other grants to make up the difference.

BOARD BOOSTS PLAN TO DEVELOP SENSITIVE LAND NEAR FOREST; ENVIRONMENT: SWANK 
HOMES AND A PRIVATE GOLF COURSE ARE PROPOSED FOR THE PROPERTY. OPPONENTS 
DENOUNCE SUPERVISORS' ACTION. 
</P>

<P>
 County officials Tuesday kept alive a controversial proposal by a financially 
beleaguered developer to construct a swank residential neighborhood and private 
golf course on ecologically sensitive land at the edge of the San Bernardino 
National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is an attempt by Landmark Land Co., which is under the 
conservatorship of the federal Resolution Trust Corp., to substantially 
increase the value of the property before the government sells it at auction. 
Other government agencies have argued that it would better serve the public as 
an undeveloped ecological preserve unique in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Bernardino County Planning Commission previously rejected the 
development proposal as too vague and ecologically insensitive, and sent it 
back for more basic negotiations. Landmark successfully appealed some aspects 
of that rejection to the County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite stinging criticism of the project by opponents, ranging from state and 
federal wildlife officials and private environmental groups to local school 
officials and Native Americans who say the land is sacred, the supervisors 
ordered the Planning Department to discuss the project again with Landmark. The 
vote was 4 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
 Board Chairman Jon D. Mikels, who four years ago received a $1,000 campaign 
contribution from Landmark and another $1,000 from one of its officers, said he 
wanted the project -- including plans for the golf course -- back to his board 
before the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels indicated his concerns about some aspects of the project, especially 
involving how Landmark could address key environmental concerns. But, he said, 
"a major redesign of this project is not required." 
</P>
<P>
 By negotiating aspects of the project with the Planning Commission instead of 
with the county's development review committee, Landmark essentially will be 
able to skirt scrutiny of the proposal at lower staff levels, where it has run 
into strong opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Mikels nor the other three supervisors responded to a parade of 
speakers who denounced the project during an acrimonious, two-hour public 
hearing. Two audience members were ejected for their outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels immediately left the meeting without talking to reporters, and he did 
not return phone calls placed later to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, he had said "there's nothing special about the property" and 
argued that its development would be a "net plus" for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 To many observers, Tuesday's action contributes to the presumption that the 
project will be approved by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project appears to be a done deal," said Dan Silver, coordinator of the 
Endangered Habitats League. "This board is pro-development and will do whatever 
Mikels wants, and he sent out a clear message to Landmark that he'll shepherd 
their project through to approval. In the end, Landmark will get what it wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason to approve this project is madness," Silver said. "This shows 
the corruption of government by the development industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Rocha, chief of the Gabrielino-Shoshone Nation of Indians, which 
considers the land sacred and historically has used rare white sage found there 
for ceremonial purposes, promised that opposition to the project would not end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't find anything in their language to describe how low they are," she 
said of the supervisors. "These are the kind of people who have no respect for 
themselves, so how can they have respect for other cultures?" 
</P>
<P>
 The 762-acre site, known as Oak Summit and situated just north of Rancho 
Cucamonga, is in a flood plain and brush-fire zone at the confluence of three 
earthquake faults. The property includes one of the state's last stands of a 
threatened flora and may support at least two endangered animal species. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the land's ecological significance and opposition from other 
governmental agencies, the RTC and Landmark are aggressively pressing plans for 
approval of the residential and golf course project. By increasing the 
property's worth, the RTC has held, the federal government's savings and loan 
bailout agency would recoup more of Landmark's losses incurred when it became 
insolvent in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC has allowed Landmark -- which has developed a number of other 
championship golf courses, including La Quinta and PGA West near Palm Springs 
-- to continue to manage the local property. 
</P>
<P>
 Unclear is what role Landmark would continue to have when the acreage is 
auctioned, and when the auction would occur. It is scheduled for Tuesday but 
may be delayed, given the uncertainty over Oak Summit's ultimate fate.

LAYOFFS BASED ON RACE ONLY ARE BACKED BY JUSTICE DEPT.; DIVERSITY: THE STAND 
REVERSES A POSITION BY BUSH ADMINISTRATION. THE CASE INVOLVES A WHITE TEACHER 
WHO WAS DISMISSED WHILE A BLACK TEACHER WAS KEPT. 
</P>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration, in a switch from the government's earlier 
position, said Tuesday that an employer can lay off a white worker and retain 
an equally qualified black worker to preserve the "diversity" of its work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 In a legal brief filed in a federal appeals court, the Justice Department came 
to the defense of a New Jersey school district that had used that reasoning in 
1989 when it dismissed a white high school teacher while preserving the job of 
a black teacher. The two teachers had been hired on the same day nine years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interest of the United States is integrating the work force," said 
Assistant Atty. Gen. Deval Patrick, who heads the Justice Department's civil 
rights division. "We do not support quotas, (but) affirmative action is a 
different animal." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the Supreme Court has said that public employers can use 
affirmative action for hiring and promotions but not for layoffs and 
dismissals. But the court has not yet ruled on whether race can figure in a 
layoff decision among equally qualified workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The court has given private employers somewhat more leeway in using racial and 
ethnic preferences in making all employment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick said that the New Jersey case presents a "quite narrow" legal question 
but that the issue nonetheless could prove politically explosive. Last week, 
when the Justice Department signaled it would change sides from the George Bush 
Administration view and support the black teacher over the white one, 
conservatives lambasted the new civil rights chief as a "quota king" in the 
Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Clint Bolick, a former Ronald Reagan Administration lawyer, accused the 
Clinton Administration of seeking a clear change in the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court has never accepted diversity as a justification for outright racial 
preferences. This could be the beginning of a whole new rationale" for 
affirmative action, Bolick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, civil rights division lawyers in the Bush Administration filed 
a lawsuit on behalf of the white teacher, Sharon Taxman, contending that she 
was wrongly fired based on her race. They argued that employers may not use 
race in layoffs except to remedy past discrimination or to cure a "manifest 
imbalance" in the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a federal judge in Newark agreed with the government's argument and 
awarded Taxman $123,000 in back pay and $10,000 in damages for pain and 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 In her opinion, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry said that it was "impermissible" 
for a school district to use race in its layoff decisions if it had never 
discriminated in the past. Moreover, she said, the Piscataway school system had 
a higher percentage of black teachers on its staff than the percentage of 
qualified black teachers available in the local work force. 
</P>
<P>
 She also cited a 1986 ruling in which the Supreme Court, on a 5-4 vote, said 
that a Michigan school district violated the rights of veteran white teachers 
when it laid them off and retained less senior black teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 How then should a school board decide on whom to dismiss among the two equally 
qualified teachers? Flip a coin, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Piscataway school board voted to appeal that ruling to the U.S. appeals 
court in Philadelphia. Now, to its surprise, the board finds the Justice 
Department on its side. The new government brief said that Judge Barry's 
decision should be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen E. Klausner, Taxman's attorney, said he was "piqued" by the 
government's switch and "outraged" by Patrick seeking a 30-day extension to 
file his brief without telling him that it was at least "flirting" with the 
idea of reversing position. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick, who did not take over the civil rights division until last April, 
said that the case came before him "in the normal course for a decision about 
what position we should take on appeal." If the previous position were allowed 
to stand, "it could significantly curtail employers from implementing voluntary 
affirmative action plans," department lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the asserted narrowness of their position -- that it affects only 
voluntary plans where the employees have identical seniority, qualifications 
and performance -- senior Justice Department officials went to unusual lengths 
Tuesday to emphasize that the case is not about "quotas" and to correct what 
they said had been "misleading and incomplete reporting." 
</P>
<P>
 They took the rare step of calling a news conference on the filing of their 
brief, complete with a two-page sheet describing Justice Department actions in 
the case in addition to the 38-page brief. Patrick was joined by Associate 
Atty. Gen. John Schmidt, the department's No. 3 official.

SPY'S SUIT PAINTS DRINKING, WOMANIZING AT CIA; GOVERNMENT: A SENIOR ESPIONAGE 
CHIEF SAYS THE BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN IGNORED. AGENCY IS NEGOTIATING A SETTLEMENT 
NOW IN A LARGER GENDER BIAS CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal lawsuit filed by one of the CIA's senior female spies portrays the 
agency as rife with womanizing and drinking and says that this conduct has been 
ignored for years by internal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges are contained in previously confidential court filings made public 
Tuesday by the career spy, who has been protected by her pseudonym, "Jane Doe 
Thompson." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thompson complaint partly surfaced in July when a federal judge in 
Alexandria, Va., allowed some legal motions to be made public but kept the 
lawsuit itself under wraps. However, the court now has made public a 140-page 
amended complaint filed by Thompson's attorney, former Justice Department 
official Victoria Toensing, which paints a bleak picture for women employees of 
the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drinking and sexual prowess by agency males in high positions are well known, 
often countenanced and, if addressed at all, engender medical, not 
disciplinary, treatment," the brief contends. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has not been a station to which plaintiff has been assigned where 
senior male officers did not drink and womanize and create an adverse work 
environment for women." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thompson lawsuit, which claims unfair treatment based on her gender, was 
filed earlier this year, and, because of her senior status, it has helped prod 
the agency to begin negotiating an administrative settlement in a larger case. 
That case is a class-action discrimination complaint brought in 1991 by women 
employed in the CIA's operations directorate, the division that handles foreign 
espionage and covert actions, in which Thompson also works. 
</P>
<P>
 The new court papers allege that "plaintiff is aware of two current married 
directorate of operations division chiefs who have had affairs with 
subordinates; one was in fact found in flagrante delicto on his couch in his 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also charges that a former high-ranking official "announced openly at 
an agency meeting that he had been drunk the evening before while meeting with 
foreign liaison officials and could not recall whether he had revealed to these 
officials highly sensitive information. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, at a party at her home overseas, Thompson stated that "a drunken 
division chief tripped over a cocktail table while grabbing for a female 
guest," while another official was regularly "too hung over to come to work in 
the mornings." 
</P>
<P>
 CIA officials have declined to comment on the merits of Thompson's allegations 
on grounds that the complaint is in the hands of agency lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the complaint, none of the unnamed CIA officials who engaged in 
womanizing or heavy social drinking were ever subjected to an inquiry by the 
agency's inspector general, although Thompson offered to provide their names to 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The court papers said that Thompson was chief of a CIA station in the 
Caribbean in 1989 when her troubles began after she reported a male deputy "for 
beating his wife to the point of strangulation." It was soon after, she said, 
that she "became the target of an inspector general investigation initiated by 
the male deputy" and several other employees she had disciplined for other 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, women now hold about 12% of the CIA's senior operations, analysis and 
administrative posts, which is up from only 6% five years ago, according to the 
agency's figures.

PORTRAYALS OF LATINOS ON TV REGRESSING; MEDIA: STUDY FINDS THE GROUP'S 
REPRESENTATION IN PRIME-TIME SHOWS IS 1%, COMPARED TO 3% IN THE '50S. AND MANY 
OF THE ROLES ARE NEGATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the nation's growing Latino population, portrayals of Latinos in 
prime-time television entertainment shows have regressed -- declining to only 
1% of all characters between 1955 and 1992, according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hollywood has cracked open the door to black concerns while letting Hispanics 
serve as window dressing," says the report by the Center for Media and Public 
Affairs, an independent media research firm in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Council of La Raza, a Latino advocacy organization that 
commissioned the study, has scheduled a news conference today in Washington to 
discuss the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, "Distorted Reality: Hispanic Characters in TV Entertainment," says 
that the number of Latinos in prime-time network shows dropped from 3% in 1955 
to 1% in the 1992-93 season. Latinos make up an estimated 10% of the nation's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the study says, black representation in TV shows rose from 
0.5% to 17%. Blacks comprise about 12% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, said his 
organization's release of the report is not intended to cause a breach between 
Latinos and blacks. He said Latinos can draw a lesson from the fact that "the 
black community has made (media representation) an issue, a priority, has been 
vocal about it and gotten results." 
</P>
<P>
 The report charged that TV's portrayals of Latinos "have not improved markedly 
since the days of Jose Jimenez and Frito Bandito. . . . While Latinos have been 
slowly climbing into professional ranks . . . out of 63 Hispanic characters in 
the 1992 sample, only one was a business manager or executive." 
</P>
<P>
 "Latinos also continued to portray criminals more frequently than other 
groups. Hispanic characters were four times more likely to commit a crime than 
were either whites or blacks (16% vs. 4% apiece)." 
</P>
<P>
 The study says that reality-based programs, such as "Cops" and "America's Most 
Wanted," "cast an even more negative image of Latinos. . . . A stunning 45% of 
Latinos portrayed in these shows committed crimes, compared to 10% of whites 
who were shown. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the only program format in which blacks fared even worse than 
Hispanics. Half of all black characters featured in these shows committed a 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 In a "report card" for the 1992-93 network season, La Raza gave both Fox and 
ABC an F. The graded factors included the percentage of Latino characters and 
those portrayed in a "negative/criminal role." CBS did best with only a C-, and 
NBC rated a D. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the best recent shows, according to the study, was the canceled "L.A. 
Law" because of the character of litigator Daniel Morales, played by A 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recent series given approval by La Raza included "The John Larroquette 
Show," "NYPD Blue," "Beverly Hills, 90210," "Hotel Malibu" and "Nurses." 
</P>
<P>
 Those that got thumbs down included "Cops," "America's Most Wanted," "seaQuest 
DSV" and the syndicated series "The Untouchables," "Baywatch" and "Acapulco 
H.E.A.T." 
</P>
<P>
 The study cited such positive past shows with Latinos as "Chico and the Man," 
with the late Freddie Prinze, and "The Man and the City," with Anthony Quinn as 
a Southwest mayor. But overall, the study said, "the cultural diversity within 
the Latino community is almost completely absent from prime time." TV's Ethnic 
Portrayals 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of Latinos in prime-time entertainment shows actually has 
dropped in the last 30 years, a study found. 1955-64 Whites: 95% Blacks: 3% 
Latinos: .5% 1992* Whites: 75% Blacks: 17% Latinos: 1% * Excluding 
reality-based syndicated series

NIGERIAN MILITARY LEADER MOVES TO CONSOLIDATE POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flexing his muscles after defeating a pro-democracy strike, Nigeria's army 
ruler on Tuesday banned three newspaper groups, made it easier to keep 
opponents jailed and decreed that his regime has absolute power. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Nigerian oil workers ended a two-month strike Monday, caving in 
to the military government of Gen. Sani Abacha. 
</P>
<P>
 They went on strike to demand Abacha surrender power to Moshood K.O. Abiola, 
widely believed to have won the annulled 1993 presidential election. Abiola is 
in jail awaiting trial on treason charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Abacha closed three newspaper and magazine groups, including the most 
influential, the Guardian of Lagos. The others are Concord, which Abiola owns, 
and Punch. 
</P>
<P>
 One decree sets Abacha above the courts, denying them any jurisdiction over 
his military government. 
</P>
<P>
 Another decree allows people to be detained for three months without being 
charged. Abacha appears intent on keeping jailed the dozens of human rights 
activists, labor leaders and pro-democracy politicians arrested in the past few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical Assn. of Nigeria said Abiola, who was arrested June 23, is 
critically ill, and threatened to take "exceptional measures" if he is not 
freed by Saturday.

 A regional leader of Mexico's opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) 
was shot to death in the troubled southern state of Chiapas, government and PRD 
officials said.Roberto Hernandez Paniagua, the center-left party's head in the 
town of Jaltenango de la Paz, was shot several times as he bicycled to a school 
where he was a teacher. The incident followed several days of unrest in 
Chiapas, where PRD supporters have blocked highways and taken over government 
buildings to protest the results of the Aug. 21 state gubernatorial election. 
The PRD claims the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party was given the 
victory only because of massive fraud.

 The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has begun recruiting Haitian exiles to train 
them as the core of a new police force in a democratic Haiti, officials 
said.The Mounties will go to Haiti to monitor the creation of the new police 
force if a U.S.-led military invasion were to restore exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, they said. The RCMP signed a memorandum of 
understanding last week with officials of the Aristide government to train up 
to 100 Haitian expatriates as police officers, a spokesman said. The Clinton 
Administration has tried to persuade Canada to join a multinational invasion 
force to oust Haiti's military leaders, but Ottawa has refused, a Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said.

GERMAN UNDERCOVER POLICE ARE OFFERED PLUTONIUM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 German undercover police have been offered illegal plutonium in what could be 
the fifth case of nuclear smuggling in as many months, Bavarian authorities 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A state Interior Ministry spokeswoman in Bavaria, where police seized illegal 
plutonium at the Munich airport last month, declined to give details of the 
latest case. 
</P>

 She told reporters only that police posing as buyers were offered plutonium 
last week. She did not say where the offer was made or how much nuclear 
contraband was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 10, Bavarian police seized 10.6 ounces of plutonium-239 that could be 
used for bomb-making.

 Two Spaniards and a Colombian were held as suspected couriers.

 It was the biggest of four seizures since May of plutonium and uranium, which 
Bonn officials say may have come from nuclear sites in Russia or other parts of 
the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow has said the source of the deadly contraband remains to be established. 
The two countries signed an agreement last month to swap intelligence and 
coordinate police action against black-market nuclear trading.

 More than 2,000 Bosnian Muslims were driven from their homes by ethnic Serbs 
in the worst two-day episode of "ethnic cleansing" in recent months, U.N. 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The forcible expulsions raised to 5,580 the number of Muslims who have fled 
the Banja Luka and Bijeljina regions of north-central and northeastern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina since mid-July, said Christiane Berthiaume, a spokeswoman in 
Geneva for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees have told U.N. officials that Bosnian Serb forces are pressing Muslim 
men into forced labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Berthiaume repeated U.N. concerns that the Serbs apparently plan to clear out 
all Muslims remaining in the northern regions.

CUBAN REPLY TO U.S. VISA PROPOSAL INCHES TALKS FORWARD; MIGRATION: ALTHOUGH AN 
AGREEMENT ON THE REFUGEE CRISIS STILL APPEARS ELUSIVE, THE RESPONSE IS CALLED 
'A SERIOUS PAPER.' EVENTUAL PACT IS EXPECTED.

 Cuba offered a few new concessions Tuesday in the migration talks with the 
United States, but agreement remained out of reach -- even though U.S. 
officials expect to settle the dispute eventually because it is in the interest 
of both countries to end the chaotic raft flotilla in the Florida Straits. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Cuban delegate Ricardo Alarcon presented Havana's written reply to the 
latest U.S. proposal, which involved an increase in its initial offer to grant 
more than 20,000 immigrant visas a year. After a 45-minute meeting, the two 
sides agreed to meet again today, indicating some progress in the delicate and 
protracted talks, which Washington had intended to end after Tuesday if Cuba's 
position was intractable. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior State Department official said that the Cuban response, apparently 
approved at the highest levels in Havana, "was more focused in on immigration 
issues, but it still has some things that we couldn't accept," a clear 
reference to Cuba's attempt to broaden the negotiations to cover issues such as 
Washington's three-decade-old economic embargo that the Clinton Administration 
is unwilling to discuss. Cuba has argued that the embargo is responsible for 
the island's deplorable economic condition, which, in turn, is the cause of the 
flood of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Another U.S. official said: "It is a serious paper. It is a basis for 
discussion." He said that the U.S. delegation will try to find out during 
today's meeting whether the Cubans are interested in an agreement limited to 
ways of ending the current refugee crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials are convinced that Cuban President Fidel Castro eventually will 
cut a deal to stop the daily spectacle of desperate rafters risking death to 
escape his island. These officials said that an orderly system of emigration 
will serve Castro's purposes far better than the disorganized flood of 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, officials conceded, the United States needs a settlement far 
more urgently than Cuba does, permitting Castro to drag out the negotiations, 
both to irritate Washington and to allow him to make sure that he gets the best 
deal the Administration is willing to make. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Coast Guard and Navy rescuing an average of 1,000 or more Cubans a 
day, the space in internment camps at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, 
Cuba, and in Panama will soon be overwhelmed. U.S. officials said that the 
Administration can continue to cope with the refugees for a while longer but 
not indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard picked up 649 Cubans by 10 p.m. EDT Tuesday after rescuing 
1,129 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to outlast them (Cuban government) and figure out what it takes to 
outlast them," one State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials believe that Castro is reaching for more than Washington is 
willing to give to resolve the crisis. "He is overplaying the very thin hand 
that he's got," one Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other government analysts said that they believe Castro is playing his 
cards skillfully. He can export his dissidents and malcontents either through 
legal emigration or on rafts, they said. Although an orderly departure system 
would allow Castro to regain complete control of who is leaving, he need not 
rush to reach that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that the exchange of proposals Monday and 
Tuesday has rekindled hope that an agreement is possible. The ceiling now on 
legal immigration from Cuba is 27,845 a year, but only about 3,000 Cubans a 
year have been able to meet the stiff U.S. visa requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 From Castro's standpoint, a legal migration agreement provides several 
important advantages. For instance, Cubans awaiting legal visas would have to 
be on their best behavior to avoid losing their chance to go. And if 
substantial numbers of dissidents were leaving legally, Cuban security police 
would no longer have to look the other way when rafters put to sea in violation 
of Cuban law, albeit a law that Castro has chosen not to enforce since early 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, an Administration official said that the Cubans seem to be 
enjoying the present round of talks in which Washington implicitly is forced to 
deal with Havana on the basis of equality, long an objective of Castro's 
diplomacy.

CAYMAN ISLANDS TO RETURN CUBANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Gore, the governor of this island nation, said Tuesday that the 
government will start repatriating Cuban refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement followed failed negotiations aimed at getting a U.S. 
detention center at Guantanamo Bay or in Panama to accept 395 Cuban refugees 
from this upscale British territory in the western Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the number of Cuban migrants now approaching 400 and more arriving daily 
. . . Cayman cannot continue to accommodate such migrants," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 400 refugees, 369 have arrived in the last month, swelling Cayman's 
tent city and territorial prison beyond capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington gave its approval to send the Cubans back, a statement by Gore 
said. It gave no indication of when repatriation would begin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last four years, about 500 Cubans have reached this three-island 
territory from Cuba, about 120 miles away. Several Cubans contacted at the tent 
city Monday said they would take to the seas again rather than return to Cuba.

 Six people were injured and four were arrested Tuesday after strikers outside 
a Dunlop Tire Corp. plant hurled rocks, bottles and concrete blocks at passing 
vehicles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The objects damaged 69 vehicles owned by Dunlop and its employees and 16 owned 
by Intergraph Corp., an unrelated company. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Dunlop employees and two Intergraph workers were injured badly enough to 
require hospitalization. A police officer and an ambulance attendant were 
slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Ronnie Fudge said law enforcement officials were forced to use 
tear gas after some of several hundred unionized rubber workers and their 
supporters sat in the middle of the road, defying a police order to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 Strikers, including some armed with sticks, began throwing debris at police. A 
Molotov cocktail also was thrown. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of United Rubber Workers Local 915 have been on strike for 11 weeks, 
rejecting a tentative deal on a new contract last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arrested were charged with disorderly conduct or resisting arrest. All 
four suspects were free on bail later in the day.

SOCIAL SECURITY TO SPEED DISABILITY CLAIMS PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Social Security Administration is moving to end long waits for disability 
benefits that have cost some Americans their health or their savings. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency will announce plans this week to speed up and overhaul the process. 
By redesigning the way it decides applications for benefits for the first time 
since the 1950s, Social Security promises to eliminate the "excessive delays, 
endless paper shuffling and bewildering procedures" that now confront millions 
of disabled people who seek the agency's help. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Shirley Chater was expected to announce the reforms today. Some 
changes can be implemented immediately, but others will require congressional 
action, revisions in federal regulations and extensive research. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said the $148-million blueprint will not change the definition of 
disability, something advocates had warned that Social Security was attempting 
under the rubric of reform when it first proposed the overhaul in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Chater said the plan, completed after several months of public comment, merely 
begins the research needed to determine how to simplify the decades-old 
standard used to decide who is disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 The streamlining comes as Social Security, its work force cut by one-fifth, 
wrestles with a record number of requests for disability benefits. Nearly 1.2 
million Americans have claims pending and another 2.9 million are expected to 
file applications next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency acknowledges it is failing sick and injured Americans at a time 
when they most need a monthly income and the federal health insurance that 
comes with a Social Security check. Long delays for benefits have left some 
applicants homeless, others have died, attempted suicide or seen their health 
deteriorate while waiting for a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Social Security says it cannot count on additional federal dollars to 
solve those service problems, in this era of tight budgets and competing social 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need is radical change -- to rebuild the procedures from the ground 
up -- in order to produce dramatic improvement in customer service," Chater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It reduces the number of employees required to handle a disability claim from 
25 to eight, while trimming the time it takes to process a claim from 155 days 
to no more than 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Claims that are rejected and appealed now require 45 employees and can take as 
long as two years to decide.

MINORITIES, WOMEN LAG ON MEDICAL EXAMS; RESEARCH: STUDY SAYS GAPS ARE LINKED TO 
STUDENTS' EDUCATION, NOT RACE OR SEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although ethnic minorities and women do worse than white males on the 
so-called medical boards -- standardized national exams taken by second-year 
medical students -- the results are related more to undergraduate educational 
achievement than to race or sex, researchers report today. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first look at the achievement of such groups on the medical boards, 
researchers found Asian Americans scored 15 to 20 points lower than white 
males, Latinos scored 60 points lower and African Americans scored 100 to 120 
points lower, while women scored an average of 30 points lower than males of 
the same ethnic group. The mean score is 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Those results are being published today in the Journal of the American Medical 
Assn. by a team from the National Board of Medical Examiners, which administers 
the test, and Southern Illinois University. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass rates on the test were 88% for whites, 84% for Asian Americans, 66% for 
Latinos and 49% for African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Achievement on the test could, in general, be predicted from the students' 
grade-point averages as undergraduates, the number of science courses they took 
and their scores on the Medical College Admission Test, independently of race. 
The two exceptions were Asian Americans and women, both of whom scored lower on 
the boards than would have been predicted from undergraduate data, said 
biostatistician Beth Dawson of Southern Illinois University, the paper's 
primary author. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who do poorly on the test do not graduate from medical school or 
become practicing physicians. The exam is given two years before graduation to 
determine placement in residencies and whether the student should remain in 
medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Dawson added, "We really do not know at this point how well these 
exams are related to performance as physicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lonnie E. Fuller, dean of the historically black Morehouse School of 
Medicine in Atlanta, noted that most of the minorities do much better the 
second or third time they take the boards, "substantially closing the gap" 
between them and whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "What concerns educators is that objective types of measures (such as the 
boards) may sometimes not reflect nonobjective measurements . . . that we think 
measure competence and the ability to get things done," Fuller said. "The 
skills that you need to be competent are often data gathering and assessment 
skills" that are not measured by multiple-choice questions, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is that those who pass the exam have a substantial 
knowledge base and turn out to be good doctors, regardless of which (ethnic 
group) they come from," said Dr. Tom Bowles, president of the National Board of 
Medical Examiners. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some critics had suspected that ethnic disparities exist, the issue 
had never been studied before because neither the application forms for the 
boards nor the tests themselves included ethnic information. Dawson and her 
colleagues were able to circumvent that difficulty by comparing data from the 
boards with that from the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), which does 
collect such information. The team studied all students who took the board 
exam, formally known as the National Board of Medical Examiners Part I 
examination, for the first time in June of 1986, 1987 and 1988, a total of 
about 48,000 students. That test has subsequently been revised and is now 
called the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination, but Bowles believes that the 
findings apply to it as well, "although we don't have enough data to publish 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller said the results were not particularly surprising. He said educators 
have long known that while high MCAT scores are predictive of success in 
medical school, low scores are less useful. A low score is very predictive of 
failure among whites, he said, but is less significant among blacks. That is, 
blacks with a low MCAT score are more likely to succeed than whites with a 
similar score. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that ethnic minorities are doing as well as anyone could 
expect them to do based on their preparation when they came in," Dawson said. 
Examining the Exams 
</P>
<P>
 Minorities and women generally do worse than white males on "medical boards," 
exams taken after the second year of medical school, a new three-year study 
finds. But educational achievement as an undergraduate is a bigger factor than 
the medical student's race or sex, the study concludes. Here are the mean 
scores and percentages in each group who passed. 03,26,12,11 WOMEN MEAN SCORE 
PASSING % * Overall women 455 79.4% * White 467 84.1% * Latina 386 55.8% *

MOTHER SAYS MARINE SON, FIANCEE DIED IN AIR CRASH

<P>
 One of four victims who died when a single-engine Cessna crashed on takeoff 
was identified Tuesday as Vincent M. Correal, a Marine stationed at the Tustin 
Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Correal, a Marine pilot, was from Carlisle, Pa., and was identified by his 
mother, Paula Correal. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the other three victims who died in Monday's crash included Correal's 
fiancee, but she did not disclose her name. The couple had planned to marry 
Dec. 31, she said. The identities of the others could not be determined by late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada County Sheriff's Department dispatcher Karen Vierra said authorities 
are withholding the identities of all victims pending autopsies by the medical 
examiner's office. Investigators said the plane was registered in Southern 
California, and all of the victims were believed to be in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots who witnessed the takeoff attempt said they heard the engine sputtering 
just before the four-passenger craft crashed into a brush-covered field, about 
700 feet beyond the end of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 The witnesses saw flames erupt in the engine area and spread to the fuselage, 
engulfing the plane and nearby brush, burning about a quarter of an acre. Parts 
of the plane were melted by the intense heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cessna 172RG apparently hit the ground nose first and bounced, landing 
upside-down about 10 feet from its initial point of impact, said Jim Woods, a 
Federal Aviation Administration safety inspector. He said it resembled a 
charred wad of crumpled paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary reports suggest that the plane may have stalled during takeoff, 
meaning its wings were not properly angled to achieve lift, Woods said.

NEVADA GOVERNOR WINS RENOMINATION IN PRIMARY 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic Gov. Bob Miller easily won renomination to a second term in 
Tuesday's primary while a state assemblyman was leading the Nevada secretary of 
state for the GOP gubernatorial nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 In the GOP Senate primary, political consultant Hal Furman defeated 
millionaire businessman Charles Woods and four others for the right to run 
against Democratic Sen. Richard Bryan, who was unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had 18,888 votes (62%) to 8,500 votes (28%) for his closest challenger, 
Las Vegas Mayor Jan Jones, with 20% of precincts reporting. Four others 
trailed, including a perennial candidate who has changed his name to Rhinestone 
Cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
 On the GOP side, state Assemblyman Jim Gibbons had 13,158 votes (52%) to 8,347 
votes (33%) for Nevada Secretary of State Cheryl Lau, with 17% of precincts 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Jones attacked Miller as part of an entrenched "good old 
boy" political system. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller raised $2 million in campaign contributions, nearly two-thirds of it 
from casino interests. Jones raised $1.3 million, just over a quarter of it 
from the gaming industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller campaigned on his record. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1986, 
became acting governor in 1989 when then-Gov. Bryan moved to the Senate, and 
won a four-year term in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Lau, who in 1990 became the first Asian American to win statewide elective 
office, attacked Gibbons for voting for a big pension increase for lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gibbons' campaign picked up momentum by focusing on his November ballot 
proposal to restrict tax increases in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 In the GOP Senate race, Furman had 13,440 votes (49 %) to 7,128 votes (26%) 
for Woods, with 20% of precincts reporting. Three others trailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods previously has run for a variety of offices in several states, always as 
a Democrat.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge who wants to become the foster father of a 16-year-old 
girl he sentenced has been moved from Juvenile Court to Civil Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Leonard Sprinkles is attempting to 
become a foster parent for the teen-ager, who he said comes from "an 
inappropriate family situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I wanted to help her out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the action was not without controversy. Dennis Handis, the county's chief 
probation officer, had said his department could not recommend placing the girl 
with the judge.

 On Tuesday, Sprinkles was moved from the juvenile division to the civil 
division, said his attorney, Albie Jachimowicz. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkles, 49, placed the girl in a county ranch eight months ago for a crime 
that he would not disclose because of her age. She is to be released in a 
couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge had said he saw no conflict because he had disqualified himself from 
any possible cases involving the youngster.

SHORING UP; NOW THAT THE SUMMER BEACH PARTY IS OVER, IT'S TIME FOR RENOVATION 
AND REPAIR 
</P>

 Like party hosts cleaning up on the day after, Orange County lifeguards and 
officials in beach cities began adding up the recent summer's visitors Tuesday 
and turned their attention to planned off-season repairs all along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 As giant combing machines raked up trash from the Labor Day weekend that 
unofficially closed summer, the small armies of lifeguards were reduced to 
skeleton wintertime crews, and beaches started closing earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're ready for the beaches to be inhabited by only sea gulls again," said 
Mike Dwinell, lifeguard manager in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials turned their attention to beach renovations that can only be done 
once the throngs have gone home. In Seal Beach, the list of things to do 
includes permanent repairs to the city's fire-damaged pier and finding 
thousands of truckloads of sand to replace its slowly disappearing beach. Work 
crews will resurface a bicycle and jogging path at Huntington State Beach, and 
the city of Huntington Beach will begin a five-year, $4-million project to 
replace restrooms and add a second beach path to ease congestion on the single 
path now shared by bicyclists and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 While summer attendance figures were not yet totaled, officials said the 
beaches saw bigger crowds than they did the year before. Hot weather may have 
played a part -- and cheaper parking may have too. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1 million people were estimated to have visited Huntington State 
Beach and Bolsa Chica State Beach, where officials had sought to boost 
attendance by dropping the daily parking fee by a dollar, to $5. The number of 
cars parked in the lots -- 272,853 -- was higher than last year's total, but by 
an amount still being figured, said Don Ito, park superintendent for the two 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The damaged Seal Beach Pier, a stretch of which burned in May and was patched 
up for summer, will need four new crossbeams and about 80 feet of decking, City 
Manager Jerry L. Bankston said. Officials also plan to replace two concrete 
pilings along the charred section that were damaged in the 1992 Landers 
earthquake. The cost is expected to be from $300,000 to $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankston also said the city hopes to find a new source of replacement sand. 
Plans to use sand excavated during the Santa Ana River rechanneling project 
were set back because there wasn't enough of the grainy stuff, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguard towers will be lonely places now that beefed-up summertime crews 
have gone back to school or other jobs. Only 11 of the 29 towers at Laguna 
Beach will be staffed and the lifeguard crew will be dropped from 44 to 16 per 
day, Dwinell said. The year-round lifeguards have plenty of repair work and 
training to keep them busy for the winter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the excitement of the summer, you're ready for a break," he said. 
"(Then) you're ready for summer again."

LAGUNA BEACH GETS HELP WITH PERMIT PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So many victims of last October's devastating fire in Laguna Beach are now 
seeking permits to rebuild their homes that City Hall has had to get help from 
an outside planning firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are attempting to maintain a five-day turnaround for the plan check 
portion of our application process," Kyle Butterwick, community development 
director, said Tuesday. "So, we are referring those plans to a consulting firm 
in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
 As of Sept. 2, victims had filed 179 applications to rebuild homes, and of 
those, 89 are in the final plan check review stage, according to Butterwick. 
Already, 54 building permits have been issued and two homes have been 
reconstructed. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm, Esgil Inc. of San Diego, has done occasional consulting for the city 
for eight years, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the fire, city officials had promised to streamline the 
application process so homeowners could more promptly rebuild their dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 27, blaze roared over more than 16,000 acres and damaged or destroyed 
more than 400 homes in Laguna Beach, Canyon Acres, Emerald Bay and El Morro 
Beach Mobile Home Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ann Christoph said Tuesday that the city staff is committed to helping 
the fire victims, even if it means working on weekends to speed the application 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know they're committed to the short turnaround and trying to get everything 
done," Christoph said. "As a matter of fact, when I visited City Hall a few 
weekends ago, they were working. I saw four or five people there and I asked 
them why were they there. They said they were trying to complete their work 
within the turnaround time." 
</P>
<P>
 Butterwick said the city staff accepts the applications and decides any zoning 
issues while the outside firm reviews the actual rebuilding plans, which go 
back to the city for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have used Esgil over the years and we're using them as an added 
safeguard," Butterwick said. "As a result, we're issuing more and more building 
permits as the property owners complete the review process." 
</P>
<P>
 Esgil's spokesman said the corporation had been asked in May to work on the 
plan checks. Butterwick said the firm averages about two plan checks a week.

TEST OF WILLS OVER SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: JIMMY PETERS, 6, BARRED LAST SPRING FROM 
A HUNTINGTON BEACH CAMPUS BECAUSE OF HIS BEHAVIOR, IS WELCOMED THERE. HIS 
FATHER WANTS TO ENROLL HIM ELSEWHERE IN THE DISTRICT OVER OFFICIALS' 
OBJECTIONS.

<P>
 When class begins in Room 1 at Circle View Elementary School this morning, 
school officials expect to enroll Jimmy Peters, a 6-year-old who has been at 
the center of a legal battle over mainstreaming special-education students. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jimmy's father has other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Ocean View school district spent $5,000 this summer training a 
special teacher and preparing the classroom for first-grader Jimmy, who 
district officials say is prone to violent outbursts, Jim Peters on Tuesday 
told them he wants his son to go to Golden View Elementary School instead. 
Their preparations, he said, weren't sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 After the three-hour meeting, which was attended by attorneys for Peters and 
the district, both sides said they would stand firm in their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm determined not to stick Jimmy in a situation where it will be harmful to 
him," Peters said. "This district must know that I will be relentless in my 
efforts to ensure that Jimmy has an appropriate educational program." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said that after their preparation and expense, the 
last-minute request to have Jimmy attend another school was "unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 "The district has trained staff at Circle View. It is ironic that despite Mr. 
Peters' previous demands for staff training, he insists on sending Jimmy to 
Golden View, where the staff has not yet been trained," said Ronald D. Wenkart, 
attorney for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators tried to remove Jimmy from his kindergarten class last spring, 
contending he was constantly disruptive and had several violent outbursts. But 
Jimmy's father refused to put him in a special class. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district then took the locally unprecedented step of filing a 
lawsuit against Jimmy after he bit his teacher in May, sending her home on 
stress leave. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district's last-ditch effort failed when a judge sent Jimmy back for 
the final days of school amid protests from parents of his classmates, some of 
whom pulled their children out of school when he returned. 
</P>
<P>
 During summer vacation, Supt. James R. Tarwater said, the district "made 
adequate preparation for the child. To make a move now would be a real 
detriment in terms of being prepared to provide a safe environment for him." 
</P>
<P>
 But Peters said a transfer would not be a major inconvenience since the two 
specialists who would work with his son are not based at a single school.  
</P>
<P>
 Peters said he also is concerned about parents who don't want Jimmy at Circle 
View and who protested his presence there last year. In addition, he is upset 
that the district has refused to hire the boy's baby-sitter as an instructional 
aide to be in the classroom, hiring someone else instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The father also requested that the district replace a window in the classroom 
with a two-way mirror so Jimmy and others in the classroom could be observed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school district is not providing for Jimmy's safety," Peters said. "They 
have all these parents who were complaining and picketing, coming into class 
and taking notes on my son. They have done nothing to change policies to ensure 
that the same thing that happened last year does not happen this year." 
</P>
<P>
 If he returns to Circle View this year, Jimmy would be one of 18 first-graders 
in the class, which also will have 10 kindergartners, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters, who is divorced and has full custody of Jimmy, also is a candidate in 
the November election for a seat on the Ocean View school board.  
</P>
<P>
 He was among the parents who attended an orientation at the school Wednesday 
morning where Jimmy's situation was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had no parents request that their child be taken out of the class at 
this time," Tarwater said. "These parents are aware. At (Golden View), none of 
that preparation has taken place." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials, who said they tried to compromise with Peters, were 
angry and disappointed after Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The staff has made an effort to get ready for Jimmy," Wenkart said. "For 
(Peters) at the last minute to pull the plug is unreasonable and not in the 
best interests of Jimmy Peters' education." 
</P>
<P>
 Wenkart said that if Peters tries to enroll Jimmy at Golden View, he will be 
asked to take the child to Circle View. If he refuses, Wenkart said, the matter 
would be placed before a state hearing officer. Under the state's "stay put" 
rule, Jimmy would attend classes at Circle View until the matter is resolved, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters accused the district of being "vindictive" and said it appears to be 
gearing up for another legal fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to go back to court, and I want my son to have an educational 
program," he said. "That's the problem. They have spent a lot of money trying 
to oust Jimmy Peters, and now they are crossing the line in denying him his 
basic right to go to his local school."

PET LOVERS GATHERING IN A PAC; POLITICS: GROUP WILL CAMPAIGN TO RETAIN CITY'S 
NEW ANIMAL SHELTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just call them the Mission Viejo Dog PAC. 
</P>
<P>
 Pet lovers have organized into a formal political action committee to protect 
the city's new $2.1-million animal shelter from City Council candidates who 
have spoken about dumping it if they're elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few months, about 100 members of the Families for a Quality 
Mission Viejo will staff phone banks and walk precincts to save the 
state-of-the-art facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In their sights are three candidates in the November election who are using 
the shelter as a big target in their campaign against purported city fiscal 
irresponsibility and waste. The three, Larry Smith, Larry Gilbert and Neil 
Lonzinger, have said that, if elected, they would look at having the county's 
Animal Control and Animal Shelter Services or a private group operate the 
shelter.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are clearly two camps in this campaign, and one would undo everything 
that's been accomplished by the city," said Council member Sharon Cody, the 
guiding force behind the shelter and chief architect of the political 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would probably sell our parks if they could get away with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three seats are open in the city election, but only two candidates have to win 
to form a majority on taking a new look at the shelter because Councilman 
William S. Craycraft, a holdover, also favors changing how the shelter is run.  
</P>
<P>
 The group backing the shelter as it stands now is supporting Mayor Susan 
Withrow, who seeks reelection, and Planning Commissioner Sherri Butterfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The PAC also criticizes the anti-shelter candidates' stand against a proposed 
$5-million library, fearing the project will be scaled down. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were gathering support for the animal shelter, we found that many 
(shelter sympathizers) were also worried about the library," Cody said. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been a group of supporters who are "really a broad spectrum of 
this community," Cody said. "We're the same people who are feeding senior 
citizens, who are on the library foundation, as well as shelter people." 
</P>
<P>
 But candidates who have been attacking city spending say the group's bark is 
probably worse than its bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Cody "told me she has 300 people in her group," said Smith, one of the three 
candidates under fire by the shelter supporters. "I guess the number keeps 
changing. I'm not disregarding them as a voice, but they're not going to make 
or break my candidacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lonzinger: "I wouldn't resort to these kind of tactics to save the 
shelter."  
</P>
<P>
 Lonzinger has no official position on the shelter, but "from the people I've 
talked to, I can't think of one person who thought the animal shelter was a 
good deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The former air freight executive said he won't be pressured into changing his 
feelings about the shelter. "I've worked for multibillion-dollar companies 
where I've been pressed and pressured before. This doesn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said if elected, he would call for a financial analysis to determine the 
fate of the shelter. Gilbert could not be reached for comment, but he has also 
favored a financial study of the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Kankar, listed as treasurer of the committee, which was formalized 
two weeks ago, said the group plans to keep its political activities clean.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never buy products when one company bad-mouths another," she said. "You can 
be for one issue or person without trashing somebody else. We don't need dirty 
politics."

 The city's Economic Development Department is ready to launch a marketing 
campaign selling Orange as a great place to live, work and start a business. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it needs an image. 
</P>
<P>
 Several businesses have agreed to sponsor a photo contest to make sure the 
city's marketers have a wide range of images to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand-prize photographer in the "Slice of Life in Orange" photo contest 
will win $500. Three others will win $250 each in the categories of business, 
lifestyle/recreation and campus life. Eight photographers each will be given an 
honorable mention and $50 in U.S. savings bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Entries can depict just about any aspect of life in Orange -- work, play or 
study, said business development officer Victoria Cleary. The photos will 
illustrate brochures and other marketing materials used to sell Orange to 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving forward with more aggressive business retention and attraction 
efforts," City Manager David F. Dixon said. "This contest is only the 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Contest rules and entry forms are available at the Orange Mall, Orange City 
News, Nextel Communications, Toyota of Orange and the Economic Development 
Department at 230 E. Chapman Ave. Residents can have forms mailed to them by

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; FIRE PREVENTION UNIT HEAD NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buena Park's chief fire investigator will become the head of the newly created 
fire prevention division of the Westminster Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald C. Tully, who has been the fire marshal at Buena Park since 1986, will 
assume his new job Sept. 19, according to Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr., who 
announced Tully's appointment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 An assistant fire chief and another division chief who will be responsible for 
administration are expected to be appointed later this month under the 
controversial City Council authorized reorganization that spawned a recall 
drive against four city officials in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Westminster firefighters union have opposed the 
reorganization and have said it would be costly to taxpayers because of the 
high salaries of new managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The assistant fire chief will earn more than $80,000 and the division chiefs 
will earn about $70,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The council authorized the department's reorganization last year as part of 
the effort to control the department's increasing expenses, particularly in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that the changes will make the 63-person department more 
efficient, make senior officials more accountable and allow the department to 
respond better to emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tully, who teaches fire technology at Rancho Santiago College, will be 
responsible for fire prevention, including educating the public on fire safety 
and handling of hazardous materials. He also will be in charge of arson 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's well-known (among firefighters) throughout Orange County and is 
well-respected," DeMonaco said. "We're lucky to be taking him." BERT ELJERA

<P>
 Stickers bearing the number are on public telephones at the district's middle 
and high schools, and signs are posted in school offices. Notices regarding the 
hot line have also been sent to parents, district spokeswoman Diane Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Callers may remain anonymous. The phone is answered by district employees

 Although weapons station officials say there is no imminent threat of closure, 
Mayor George Brown says there is a very real threat of development on the 
environmentally sensitive land now occupied by the Navy, should the 5,000-acre 
weapons station close. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of this is a wildlife sanctuary and it's supposed to be protected, but 
when the developers come along you just never know," Brown said. "They would 
just have a field day trying to develop that." 
</P>
<P>
 A new list of military bases targeted for closure or modification from the 
federal Base Realignment and Closure Commission is not expected until January. 
But two years ago, when the last list was issued, Brown said the weapons 
station was targeted for realignment. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapons station's current work force of more than 700 military and 
civilian employees will shrink to about 600 on Nov. 18 because of defense cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always go on the list," said weapons station spokesman Joe Davidson. "But 
the weapons station has never been considered for closure because of our 
mission here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seal Beach base supplies the Navy's Pacific fleet with weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Frank Laszlo says there has been talk of closing one of the 
Navy's five weapons stations in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard conflicting reports as to the potential of the (Seal Beach) 
weapons station closing," Laszlo said. "If any are closed, it will be either 
Concord or Seal Beach. There's always the potential of base closure." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's seven-member ad hoc committee, to include council members and two 
community representatives, also will monitor the Los Alamitos Armed Forces 
Reserve Center and the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. RUSS LOAR

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; SMOKE-FREE LAW MAY REDUCE BINGO INCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The twice-weekly bingo games sponsored by the Irvine Unified School District 
that raise nearly $50,000 a year for music programs, band uniforms and 
instruments are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal law requiring all public schools to be smoke-free by the end of the 
year has bingo operators warning that attendance will plummet if bingo players 
are not allowed to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be very difficult for them to continue the operation if they 
don't allow smoking," school district Supt. David E. Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals from the U.S. Department of Education's Goals 2000 program, signed 
into law on March 31 by President Clinton, require all public schools, public 
libraries and public health facilities to be smoke-free as of Dec. 26. Public 
school teachers will have to leave campus if they want to smoke, according to 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents from music booster groups at the district's three high schools help 
run the bingo games, which meet Wednesday and Saturday nights at Rancho San 
Joaquin Middle School. At Irvine High School alone, district officials estimate 
between $15,000 and $30,000 is raised each year from bingo for underfunded 
instrumental music programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This money is what makes the difference in having special programs like 
marching band and jazz band at Irvine High," said school board President 
Michael B. Regele, a bingo volunteer whose son plays trombone in the high 
school marching band. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members are expected to meet with parents from high school music 
booster clubs to seek a way to keep the income flowing from the year-round 
bingo games. But Regele says he does not see any possibility in obtaining an 
exemption from the smoke-free law to allow smoking at local schools. "It's a 
federal law," he said. "We have no control over that." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Unified fine arts coordinator Stan Steele said the only solution may be 
to move the bingo games away from local schools. But the cost of leasing 
another location could seriously erode bingo profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of bingo players has declined in recent years, but school district 
officials say the majority of them smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of bingo money, officials say, would still have a dramatic effect on 
high school instrumental music programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The instruments are all getting older, and there isn't any other source of 
money to buy new instruments," Steele said. "We'd be concerned about a 
significant cutback in the instrumental music programs without this money."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; ADULT HEALTH CARE CENTER TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An adult health care center will open Thursday to provide health, therapeutic 
and social services to frail, elderly, physically or mentally impaired adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harbor Adult Health Care will be open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through 
Friday inside the Rea Community Center, 661 W. Hamilton St. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley residents are also welcome to the health 
services, said Beverly Daniels, the program director of the nonprofit 
organization, which is certified by the Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real need in the community for a health care center like this 
one," Daniels said. "This is specifically geared for a special population that 
is having medical problems. An average healthy senior citizen would not come to 
something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 A registered nurse, a certified social worker, a psychologist, an activity 
coordinator and a consulting doctor will assess the individual's health needs 
at the center, then offer a variety of services, including nutritional and 
psychological counseling, physical therapy, blood pressure readings and insulin 
injections. 
</P>
<P>
 Information on diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's will be available, 
along with a list of the symptoms. The registered nurse will be able to 
administer medication. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients rebounding from strokes can also receive help at the center, whether 
it is learning how to walk or talk or use their limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the goal of the center, Daniels said, is to prevent placing the 
elderly in convalescent homes by dealing with their health problems in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Dances and sing-alongs are a few activities that will take place at the center 
for those who are able. Exercise classes will be held, and current events will 
be talked about. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees may be covered through health insurance, managed care programs, medical 
benefits or private pay. Programs are available for those who cannot afford the 
services. 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; WATCHDOG GROUP PLANS MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Huntington Beach man has formed a watchdog group to monitor what it 
considers excessive or unnecessary government spending. 
</P>
<P>
 It is called Committees of Correspondence, named after Samuel Adams' 
Revolutionary War citizens' groups, founder Bill Mello said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objectives are the same as Samuel Adams'. Their objective was to 
communicate with all the other colonies, and they wanted to unite and have a 
common front against King George III of Britain," Mello said. "We're trying to 
fight oppressive taxes and acts of tyranny by the government." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 Committees of Correspondence consists of residents of 17 Orange 
County cities, Mello said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group formed in April, after Mello spoke at a City Council meeting and 
complained about the controversial issue of city employees inflating their 
pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello said others shared his views, and today the group has 120 members who 
plan to investigate other issues affecting taxpayers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Committees of Correspondence will meet Thursday at the Orange City Council 
chambers, 300 E. Chapman Ave. The public is invited to attend the 7 p.m. 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers will include Mello and representatives from like-minded groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello said the goal is "to communicate with the different communities to let 
them know what is happening in our local government and the methods they can 
use to combat excessive taxes and abuses by city government." 
</P>
<P>
 Mello said that representatives of the groups involved will meet monthly to 
discuss issues and strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve White, vice president of Anaheim HOME, a citizens group formed in 1987 
with a membership of about 1,600, said the groups "could be a mutual benefit to 
each other" in building a countywide coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 His group's major concern today, he said, is Disneyland's plans to expand the 
theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Walters, president of the 381-member Orange Taxpayers Assn., formed in 
1986 to monitor city spending, support property rights and fight taxes, also 
agreed that uniting groups is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get together with different groups, you hear about what's going on 
in their city, and it gives you ideas on what to watch for in your city," 
Walters said. "We can help each other, and we can get information." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; MERGER AT CAL STATE UNDER NEW STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's criminal justice and political science departments, 
which merged two years ago, are re-evaluating the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Some professors, alumni and students want the criminal justice department, 
which has been growing in popularity for years, to be independent again. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite two votes by faculty members last year to keep the departments 
together, a committee has been formed to re-examine the merger, said Sandra 
Sutphen, chairwoman of the joint division. 
</P>
<P>
 She said it is possible the committee will recommend dissolving the union. 
Sutphen said, however, she thinks that would be unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recommendations that could be considered include keeping the departments 
together or consolidating them so the criminal justice department would no 
longer be offered as a major. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Lasley, a professor in the criminal justice department, said students who 
want to concentrate their studies on criminal justice will suffer if the 
department disappears. He says the political science department is trying to 
force criminal justice students to take political science courses because the 
department has had problems attracting students to the major. 
</P>
<P>
 The political science department "is trying to stay alive," Lasley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last semester, there were 608 criminal justice majors and 397 political 
science majors, according to Donald Castro, dean of the School of Humanities 
and Social Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Mitzner, an Alumni Assn. member and former Associated Students president, 
graduated from Cal State Fullerton with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice 
before the division was created.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he chose the university and its criminal justice program because of 
its reputation for producing top graduates, many of whom have become police 
chiefs, politicians, attorneys and high-ranking officers in the criminal 
justice field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the merger is a done deal, criminal justice virtually disappears," 
Mitzner said. "It will fall under political science, and students will no 
longer be able to major in criminal justice. . . . The professors are having 
debates over that, expressing a moral dilemma. If the professors aren't happy, 
then that will affect the education of the students." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutphen said the departments were combined administratively only on a trial 
basis in an effort to save money but that students can still major in either 
criminal justice or political science. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro said he does not believe a problem exists. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it is highly unlikely that the newly formed committee will recommend 
separating the two departments or dropping the criminal justice major. 
</P>
<P>
 "To spread the rumor that this is a move to make criminal justice disappear is 
so way off the mark that it's ridiculous," Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 W. Garrett Capune, a criminal justice professor, said he believes the 
committee will fairly evaluate the merger and try to find ways to improve it.

<P>
 At the suggestion of Mayor R. Craig Scott, the city's Parks and Recreation 
Department is considering the possibility of staging recreational events at 
some private parks to increase participation by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott has asked the department to look into the feasibility of sponsoring 
summer concerts or day camps for youths in the private parks at Nellie Gail 
Ranch and Moulton Ranch housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who lives in Nellie Gail Ranch, says many of his neighbors don't turn 
out for city-sponsored events because the public parks are too far from their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will be more likely to participate if events are in their 
neighborhood," Scott said. "I would like to see the fine services of parks and 
recreation available to all the citizens of Laguna Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks and Recreation Director Dave Lewis said it will be several months before 
officials decide whether to begin sponsoring events at the private parks. LYNN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; POSSIBLE DONORS OF BONE MARROW SOUGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Red Cross is marking National Bone Marrow Donor Awareness Week by 
asking residents to be tested as possible donors. 
</P>
<P>
 A bone marrow drive will take place Sept. 15 from 9:30 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. at 
the Hewlett Packard building, 1421 S. Manhattan St. in Fullerton.A second drive 
will take place Sept. 14 at Ingram Micro, 1600 E. St. Andrews Place in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60,000 local residents have been tested and placed on a national donor 
registry. About 1.3 million people nationwide are on the list, and more than 
2,600 marrow transplants have taken place in the United States so far this 
year. Twenty-nine local residents donated marrow in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross officials said that patients generally have the best chance of 
benefiting from marrow donated by family members. But when family marrow is not 
available, doctor can often use marrow from unrelated donors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross is especially eager in finding donors from minority groups such 
as African Americans, Latinos, Asians and Native Americans. Only 18% of the 
donors on the national registry are nonwhite. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors must be between ages of 18 and 55 and be in good health. 
</P>

JEWISH PARENTS PROTEST SCHOOL START DATE; EDUCATION: SEVERAL ADULTS SAY IT WAS 
INSENSITIVE TO BEGIN CLASSES ON ROSH HASHANAH AT SIX ANAHEIM CAMPUSES. DISTRICT 
ASSURES THEM IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

 Classes at six Anaheim schools started Tuesday, even though it was one of the 
holiest days of the year for Jews. But Jewish parents should rest assured: It 
won't happen again, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned our lesson," Anaheim City School District Supt. Meliton Lopez 
said. "We should have worked harder to accommodate this holiday." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Jewish parents protested the district's decision in May to start 
classes on Rosh Hashanah, which marks the beginning of the Jewish new year. 
Lopez said he got two calls from parents last week, and people protested at a 
school board meeting last spring when school calendars were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't move our holidays, but they can move the day their school begins," 
said Sandra Blumenkranz, a congregant at Fullerton-based Temple Beth Tikvah of 
North Orange County, which has various activities just for children during High 
Holy Days. 
</P>
<P>
 "When this happens to a Jew, it happens to all Jews," said Blumenkranz, who 
noted that other Jewish parents were similarly upset. "What's important is, 
this should not happen again. They should know the importance of showing 
respect to a minority." 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the 21 schools in the year-round Anaheim district started Tuesday. 
About 4,000 students attend those six schools. The other 15 schools began class 
in July.

 Officials had no estimate of how many Jewish children were held from school to 
attend synagogue on the first full day of the celebratory holiday, which began 
at sundown Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to tell, but it doesn't seem to be affecting attendance," Lopez 
said. "There are two teachers we know of who did not come to work, and that's 
typical -- they take High Holy Days off."  
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said district officials knew in advance that class would begin on the 
holiday but had little choice in starting on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we're being insensitive -- we knew about it," Lopez said. "It's 
just the first time it's been an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said that when district administrators realized in May that the first 
day of classes for the six non-year-round schools would fall on Rosh Hashanah, 
they wanted to renegotiate the September start date with the Anaheim Elementary 
Education Assn., which represents the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the association did not want to renegotiate the start date without 
renegotiating the entire year-round school calendar, Lopez said. District 
officials did not want to revise the calendar because that would have meant 
changing school dates about a month before classes were scheduled to start for 
the district's 15 year-round schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the future, we'll just insist that if a Jewish holiday falls on the first 
day of school, we negotiate at the table until we arrive at agreement," Lopez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blumenkranz said her two children started classes at a school in the Brea 
Olinda Unified School District last week. She kept her children out of school 
Tuesday, and she said she would have asked parents to call or write letters of 
protest to other school districts if classes had begun on Rosh Hashanah, as 
they did in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either start (class) before the holiday or after," Blumenkranz said. "But not 
on the day. You'd think they could have adjusted the schedule somehow."

MARINE IDENTIFIED AS AIR CRASH VICTIM; ACCIDENT: THE TUSTIN PILOT'S MOTHER SAYS 
HE AND HIS FIANCEE WERE AMONG THE FOUR WHO DIED WHEN THE SMALL PLANE WENT DOWN 
ON TAKEOFF FROM TRUCKEE.

<P>
 One of four victims who died when a single-engine Cessna crashed on takeoff 
was identified Tuesday as Vincent M. Correal, a Marine pilot stationed at the 
Tustin Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Correal, originally from Carlisle, Pa., was identified by his mother, Paula 
Correal, who is Carlisle justice of the peace. 
</P>
<P>
 She said one of the other three people who died in Monday's crash was 
Correal's fiancee. The couple had planned to marry Dec. 31, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The identities of the other two are unknown.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevada County sheriff's dispatcher Karen Vierra said authorities are 
withholding the identities of all the victims pending autopsies by the medical 
examiner's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the plane was registered in Southern California and all of 
the victims were believed to be in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots who witnessed the takeoff attempt said they heard the engine sputtering 
just before the four-passenger plane crashed into a brush-covered field, about 
700 feet beyond the end of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 The witnesses saw flames erupt in the engine area and spread to the fuselage, 
engulfing the plane and nearby brush, burning about one-quarter of an acre. 
Parts of the plane melted in the intense heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Resembling a charred wad of crumpled paper, the Cessna 172RG apparently hit 
the ground nose first and bounced, landing upside-down about 10 feet from its 
initial point of impact, said Federal Aviation Administration safety inspector 
Jim Woods, who was investigating the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary reports suggest the plane may have stalled during takeoff, meaning 
its wings were not properly angled to achieve lift, Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor that may have contributed to the accident is density altitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying it was a factor in this one, but it's usually a factor in the 
summer at these (mountain) airports," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because air at high altitude is thinner than air at sea level, plane engines 
operate at reduced power. When temperatures warm the air, it becomes even 
thinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, although Truckee is at 5,900 feet, planes frequently perform as if 
they are flying at 7,500 feet or more.

CHARGES DENIED IN KILLINGS OF MOTHER, INFANT; COURTS: WIFE OF TAIWANESE 
EXECUTIVE PLEADS NOT GUILTY OF FATALLY STABBING HER HUSBAND'S LOVER AND 
SUFFOCATING THE WOMAN'S 5-MONTH-OLD SON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The wife of a wealthy Taiwanese businessman pleaded not guilty Tuesday to 
charges of first-degree murder in the slayings of her husband's lover and a 
5-month-old child allegedly produced by the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Li-Yun (Lisa) Peng, 44, of Rancho Santa Margarita, entered her plea in Orange 
County Superior Court, where she has been ordered to stand trial in the Aug. 
18, 1993, fatal stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say Peng stabbed Ranbing (Jennifer) Ji 18 times in Ji's Mission 
Viejo apartment. Also killed was Ji's son, Kevin, who authorities say was 
suffocated in his crib. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contend that Peng killed the mother and son because she was 
jealous of the victim's relationship with Peng's husband, Tseng Peng, 51. He is 
chief executive officer of San Diego-based Ranger Communications, one of the 
world's largest manufacturers of citizens band radios. 
</P>
<P>
 Peng could face the death penalty if convicted of killing Ji and her son, but 
Orange County prosecutors have not decided whether they will seek the maximum 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Genetic fingerprinting is expected to play a major role in the case. Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Robert Molko argued during a preliminary hearing that DNA evidence 
links Peng to saliva found in a bite mark on Ji's left arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Peng's preliminary hearing spanned three months to allow Municipal Judge 
Arthur Koelle to read volumes of DNA research presented by both sides. Koelle 
ruled last month that the DNA evidence was admissible and ordered Peng to stand 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Marshall M. Schulman, however, has denounced the high-tech 
testing as unreliable "voodoo." Schulman said in court that there is evidence 
that Ji attacked Lisa Peng with a knife on the day of the murder, a factor 
Schulman said could clear his client of first-degree murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 He also claimed there was no evidence linking Peng to the baby's death.

PROGRESS ON 'YOUTH ACTION PLAN' SATISFIES ORGANIZERS; CHURCHES: GRASS-ROOTS 
GROUP CITES COOPERATIVE SPIRIT AFTER MEETING WITH SANTA ANA OFFICIALS ON 
PROGRAMS TO HELP TROUBLED YOUTHS AND MAKE NEIGHBORHOODS SAFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A grass-roots group representing 15 church congregations countywide left a 
meeting with city and school officials Tuesday satisfied that a youth plan 
drafted by the group in May will come to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a real good spirit of cooperation in the meeting. Overall it was 
very positive," Andy Saavedra, a co-chairman of the Orange County Congregation 
Community Organization, said after the gathering with Mayor Daniel H. Young, 
the city manager and other officials of the city and school district. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization first released its "youth action plan" at a May meeting that 
packed St. Anne Catholic Church with 1,000 residents. Group leaders called on 
the school district and city to help create job opportunities, after-school 
programs and family support for troubled youths and increase safety in troubled 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Saavedra said the group learned that Santa Ana police had juggled 
shifts to provide a greater presence outside schools at busy times and that a 
city-funded anti-gang program will receive more staffing and better equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just really happy with the continuing cooperative effort," said Tory 
Tomberlin, an organization member. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen community organizers from churches throughout Santa Ana attended 
the meeting, which offered them a chance to press city and school officials for 
firm commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Paul M. Walters agreed to meet with the group within three weeks 
to discuss community policing, and city staff members discussed plans for 
spending $150,000 recently added to Project PRIDE, the city's anti-gang 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will go to expand the program's curriculum, start a Friday night 
event for teen-agers and launch more PRIDE clubs in which parents can 
participate, said Lorraine Lazarine, the city's council services manager. It 
also will go to buy cellular phones for staff members who run the PRIDE clubs, 
held at intermediate schools after hours, because members of the Congregation 
Community Organization are concerned about security at the sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Other private businesses and public agencies have come forward in recent 
months to contribute to the youth action plan: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orange County Bar Assn. has volunteered to work with the organization to 
set up summer job internships with local law firms. The program, dubbed SELF 
for Summer Employment With Law Firms, is modeled on one in St. Louis, said 
Donna Fouste, bar association executive director. It will begin next summer and 
be open to students entering their junior and senior years of high school.  
</P>
<P>
 * The Santa Ana Unified School District has applied for a $25,000 grant to 
expand homework centers at four elementary schools, open them to children from 
parochial schools and hire tutors, said John Bennett, an assistant 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 * City officials have been facilitating meetings between the county and the 
Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange to find a building for Taller San Jose (St. 
Joseph's Workshop), an educational and vocational training center for troubled 
youth scheduled to open in 1995. City officials and Taller San Jose organizers 
said Tuesday that the group is on the verge of signing an agreement with the 
county to lease a building at Broadway and Civic Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The program hopes to begin serving 50 teen-agers by early 1995, offering 
everything from a high school education to help filling out job applications 
and tips on neatness and interviewing, said Judy Gorsuch, administrative 
assistant for Taller San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is for kids that really have been disconnected from existing support 
systems," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Catholic Charities has vowed to work with Congregation Community 
Organization in implementing support services for families of troubled youths, 
and ultimately hopes to set up a family support center in Santa Ana, said Judy 
Mader, director of Catholic Charities' outreach program. Mader said Catholic 
Charities just hired a parent outreach coordinator who will attend parent 
education classes at five Santa Ana parishes and offer additional counseling to 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization drafted the four-part youth action plan after sending surveys 
to more than 10,000 families.

RELATIONSHIPS / ORANGE COUNTY: REMODELING? PUT PATIENCE IN THE BLUEPRINTS; WHEN 
WALLS COME DOWN, TEMPERS CAN FLARE UP AND TEST EVEN THE MOST SOLID OF FAMILY 
FOUNDATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 If Sharon and Bob Gordon needed a warning about what a big home remodeling 
project could do to a family, they only had to look out the front door. A 
neighboring couple tore down their old house and were in the process of 
rebuilding it when they divorced. The skeleton-like, unfinished frame was a 
reminder of how the stress of construction can lead to a family's 
deconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 But in October, 1992, the Gordons went ahead with a yearlong project to add a 
den and bedroom to their Orange Park Acres house, just as they brought their 
new baby daughter home from the hospital. "It was a little frightening, but we 
felt it was something we needed to do," says Sharon Gordon. "During that year 
there were some tough moments, but we needed the added space, so we just tried 
to focus on the light at the end of the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting through a remodel with your family intact takes planning, patience 
and, probably, a little luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "During a stressful living situation, any flaws in a relationship are going to 
be tested," says Jane Van Wagoner, a marriage, family and child counselor in 
Fullerton. "It's often hard to communicate clearly when under stress, which 
leads to problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve and Marcia Schechter of Fountain Valley had planned the remodeling of 
their home in three phases. In the first year's project, they remodeled the 
kitchen and expanded the family room. The following year, in a less taxing 
project, they had their master bedroom redone. But this year they decided not 
to knock down any more walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just felt that we're not ready for this again," says Marcia Schechter. "We 
went through two years of construction, and now we need a break." 
</P>
<P>
 The Schechters had to deal with one of the most common causes of remodeling 
stress -- delays. "Our contractor estimated that it would take two months to 
redo the kitchen and family room. By the time it was finished, nine months had 
passed," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems with kitchen cabinets, which had to be returned to the factory 
several times before they fit, took the most time. "When they were delivered 
the second time and I saw that they still weren't right, I could feel my 
stomach tie up in knots. We were trying to live in this house that was all torn 
up, and it just felt that it would never be right." 
</P>
<P>
 The delays created some tense moments for the Schechters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like 'Here we go again,' another delay. But we knew that this was a 
project we were committed to. If we both didn't have the same desire to 
continue the remodel, it wasn't worth the trouble. If it had been either of us 
who pushed the other person along into doing it, there would have been problems 
between us," says Marcia Schechter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed a good sense of humor to survive," says Steve Schechter. "You need 
to be able to laugh while you're writing big checks and waiting for your house 
to be livable again." 
</P>
<P>
 Having both partners involved in a remodeling project can help relieve 
tension. "Part of the planning stage should be spent learning about each of 
your expectations," says Barbara Kreedman, a psychologist based in Santa Ana. 
"Define your roles. If one person gets stuck with the majority of the work, 
resentment can grow." 
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen is not just a place to prepare and eat food, it's where a family 
interacts much of the time. Good planning helped the Schechters adjust to life 
without a kitchen. Marcia was able to cook the favorites she, Steve and their 
teen-age daughter, Ann, enjoyed when they had plumbing and a real stove. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had prepared meals and kept them in our deep freeze in the garage. We had 
set up a microwave and coffee-maker in other rooms, and we were able to eat 
well for a while," Marcia Schechter says. "I also did some gourmet cooking and 
was amazed at what one can do without a kitchen. It meant cutting up a salad in 
the bathroom sometimes, but it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Schechters decided to tough it out and remain in their house during 
their remodeling, that's not always possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert and Debra Navarro of Tustin had two bedrooms and a bath added, making 
their single-level home a two-story one this summer. "When you're having a new 
story built, it just becomes too much of a mess to live in," says Debra 
Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they thought they could tough it out themselves, their two young 
daughters couldn't, so Debra Navarro and the girls moved in with her parents 
for most of the construction. "They were bothered by the noise and having their 
home torn up. And our oldest, who is 6, has asthma, so we didn't want to take a 
chance with all the dust that was flying around," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert Navarro, who runs his computer design business from home, decided to 
stay put. "I set up an office in the garage, which wasn't easy since it's not 
air conditioned. But eventually I got into a routine where I wasn't working 
during afternoons when it got too hot in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they were separated by only a few miles, having Gilbert Navarro 
stay at the house and Debra and the girls at her parents' made for a sometimes 
difficult summer. "There were times when we'd both be tired and tempers were 
short," says Debra Navarro. "We just had to vent sometimes. The separation 
wasn't easy, but we frequently took off by ourselves just to talk. When we were 
together though, we usually ended talking about the house." 
</P>
<P>
 The Navarros tried to shield their daughters from as much project-related 
stress as possible. "We couldn't just take them from their house, from their 
own rooms, make them share a bed for a couple of months and expect them to be 
perfectly behaved," Gilbert Navarro says. "They acted out a lot, and that was 
hard on me. I didn't want to see them affected." 
</P>
<P>
 Says psychologist Kreedman: "Children need to have consistency in their lives 
to feel secure. They need to see that although a remodeling project might 
change their room, it's the same room they've had." 
</P>
<P>
 By sharing the project with the entire family so that no one feels left out, 
children can see the turmoil in a positive way. "If they feel like they're a 
part of the project, they're not as likely to feel anger toward it for 
disrupting their lives," Kreedman says. 
</P>
<P>
 She says children commonly resent a remodeling disruption when they see their 
parents arguing over it. "They associate the project as bad, especially if 
their parents spend time away from them working on it. They need to be assured 
that the project is good." 
</P>
<P>
 Although an older child will understand the work being done to their house, 
they may not like it. "It's important to be honest with them, show that you 
care about their concerns about the project and (that) you're interested in 
what they have to say," says counselor Van Wagoner. "If and when problems 
develop with the project, don't keep things from them. When they see their 
parents on edge, it's important for them to know that they're not the cause." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gordons, who spent a year living in a half-built house with a new baby, 
found that much of the strain was caused by trying to keep at least part of 
their home normal. "We were very conscious about keeping out the dust in our 
living areas, but it wasn't easy. We were constantly laying out paper on the 
carpeting and cleaning, but it never seemed enough," says Sharon Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the worst part of remodeling for some people," says psychologist 
Kreedman. "Someone with obsessive-compulsive tendencies who likes order might 
feel completely out of control. Being aware of these tendencies within you can 
help you through this." 
</P>
<P>
 The key to remodeling and keeping the family together appears to be planning.

 "Try to picture how you'll get along in a huge mess and what added 
responsibilities each person will have," Van Wagoner says. "Try to be creative 
and keep as much continuity to the house as possible. But also be aware that no 
matter how prepared you are, some things are going to go wrong, and there's 
bound to be friction. You'll need an attitude of 'We're in this together.' "

CONSERVING PAINTINGS AND A MUSEUM'S ROLE; ART: LACMA OFFICIALS SAY ITS 
EXHIBITION FOCUSING ON RESTORATION OF TWO 15TH-CENTURY WORKS PROVIDES A CONTEXT 
FOR ART HISTORY AND AN INSTITUTION'S RESPONSIBILITY.

 "From Aragon and Castile: The Restoration of Two Spanish Paintings From the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Art" is one of the smallest exhibitions ever 
mounted at LACMA. Installed for only 15 days through Sept. 18, it is also one 
of the shortest. But, according to the museum's staff, this comparative view of 
two paintings is both big and long in terms of effort and educational value. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizing a window of opportunity -- between major exhibitions of Korean and 
Indian art -- the museum's departments of conservation and European paintings 
and sculpture have collaborated to unite "The Last Supper" (circa 1490) by 
Pedro Berruguete and an unknown artist's "Triptych With Scenes From the Life of 
Saint George" (1425-50). The Berruguete, which was purchased in 1990 with funds 
from the Ahmanson Foundation and put on view the next year, is already familiar 
to LACMA aficionados, whereas the anonymous triptych is making what amounts to 
a debut. Curators say the painting has been exhibited in the past but that it 
has mostly languished in storage since 1950, when LACMA received it as part of 
a bequest from William Randolph Hearst. 
</P>
<P>
 Although painted in the same country and century, the two 15th-Century Spanish 
works appear to have more differences than similarities. But that's the point, 
according to curator J. Patrice Marandel and paintings conservator Joseph 
Fronek. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pairing two paintings that differ greatly in technique, style and subject 
provides a context to explore art historical issues and to demonstrate the 
responsibility we have to the works we acquire," Marandel says. "This is a 
behind-the-scenes show" and "it's the wave of the future," he says, noting that 
museums are making better use of their collections in these days of reduced 
budgets and fewer imported blockbusters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors learn -- from text panels and a brochure -- that the Saint George 
legend is portrayed in a retablo, or altarpiece, probably created near Zaragoza 
in Aragon. Working in egg tempera and gold and silver leaf on wood panels, the 
unknown artist employed an impressive array of techniques to create illusions 
of floral designs on brocade costumes, reptilian textures and dry landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Last Supper," on the other hand, is a sarga, the Spanish term for a 
painting executed in a water-and-glue-base paint on linen. With its dry 
surface, broad strokes and vast (6 feet by 10 feet) dimensions, Berruguete's 
work resembles a fresco. It is thought to have been created for a monastery's 
refectory in Castile, northwest of Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
 Both works have an Italian connection. Berruguete's fresco-like work emulates 
a method of painting on plaster frequently used in Italy. And many scholars 
believe that "The Last Supper" was inspired by Andrea del Castagno's painting 
of the same subject in the refectory of Sant'Apollonia in Florence. As for 
"Saint George," the painting techniques bear similarities to gold ground 
pictures of the Italian Renaissance, but the composition of stacked vignettes 
depicting the saint's mythical life follows Spanish tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Fronek faced completely different challenges in restoring the two paintings. 
In "The Last Supper," he had to remove discolored adhesives that had been 
infused into the linen to attach flaking pigment in a previous restoration 
effort. To patch torn side sections, he added new fabric that he covered with a 
putty-like substance, textured to match the original linen. In keeping with 
current conservation practices, all restorations are applied with the same 
synthetic medium for easy detection and removal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saint George" was a more straightforward job. While restoring the triptych as 
closely as possible to its original luster, Fronek removed several decades of 
grime along with past restorations that had become discolored. The rewards are 
obvious, he says, pointing out exquisite details that have endured for more 
than 500 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as Marandel says, "you don't just get out some cotton and Ajax to clean 
a painting." 
</P>
<P>
 And that is part of the exhibition's message. "We want the public to know how 
much care goes into the maintenance of the collection," he says.

KCOP TAKES A 'RISKY' PATH IN LATE-NIGHT TV; PROGRAMMING: CHANNEL 13 SETS 2 1/2 
HOURS OF FIRST-RUN SHOWS IN A SLOT USUALLY USED FOR TALK SHOWS AND SYNDICATED 
RERUNS. THE TARGET AUDIENCE -- YOUNG ADULTS.

<P>
 "The Arsenio Hall Show" is history. But the late-night landscape on KCOP-TV 
Channel 13 is more "busy," as the departed talk-show host liked to say, than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 KCOP has procured a 2 1/2-hour block of original, syndicated programming 
specifically designed as a late-night alternative to news, old sitcoms and the 
tried-and-true network talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has ever done this before," said Rick Feldman, KCOP's general manager. 
"And first-run (programming) is very risky because it's hit and miss, and you 
don't know what is going to work and what isn't. But if stations like mine 
didn't take a risk, you'd just be getting all the same boring stuff you always 
get. Old episodes of 'MASH' and 'Cheers' are fine, but how many times do you 
want to see them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Monday at 10:30 p.m., immediately after the station's half-hour 
newscast, Channel 13 will fill the void left by "Arsenio" with four daily news, 
comedy and talk programs aimed at young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at our station, except for the 6 to 8 p.m. block, we have become 
more and more first-run original programming in every part (of the day), so it 
makes sense to stay that way in late night too," Feldman said. "And when these 
shows -- 'Last Call,' 'The Newz' and 'The Jon Stewart Show' -- turned up, they 
fit the profile of my station, which is very few older people and lots of young 
adults." 
</P>
<P>
 "Last Call," produced by former NBC guru Brandon Tartikoff and airing at 10:30 
p.m., is described by Feldman as a "younger, humorous 'McLaughlin Group,' " 
discussing, debating and dissin' the news and personalities of the day. Hosted 
by Brianne Leary, former star of the TV series "CHiPs" and a free-lance 
journalist, the show features a group of youngish, hip-ish panelists sitting 
around and mostly making light of issues from the world of politics, business, 
culture and sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will do serious topics, but it's not just 20 minutes on Bob Dole versus 
George Mitchell," Feldman said. "They will also do some of the more bizarre 
stories that exist in the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Newz," following at 11, is probably the riskiest venture because it will 
attempt to create a half-hour of topical sketch comedy, a la "Saturday Night 
Live" and "In Living Color," on a daily rather than weekly basis. Featuring an 
ensemble cast of stand-up comics and improvisational actors and a team of 
writers grounded in the Harvard Lampoon, the show will spoof the day's news 
events and include recurring characters such as Andy and Abby, a couple of 
combative columnists dispensing advice on relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Premier Story," at 11:30 p.m., has been airing on KCOP since June and is the 
only one of the new late-night programs that won't lean heavily toward the 
comedic. Feldman admits that it might be out of place sandwiched between comedy 
and commentary on either side, but the catch is that the program -- essentially 
a tabloid news magazine modeled after "A Current Affair" -- is produced by 
Chris Craft, which owns KCOP. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to baby it a little bit," Feldman admitted, refusing to move it 
to the 10:30 slot after the news because the station has already spent a good 
deal of money promoting its place at 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jon Stewart Show," airing at midnight, is Paramount's replacement for 
"Arsenio Hall," a one-hour talk show aimed at a younger crowd than the 
Letterman-Leno competition. Strictly black T-shirts and Doc Martens, Stewart is 
a guy who looks like he's never worn a suit and tie in his life -- certainly 
not on MTV, where his show got its start. His routine is expected to be the 
same: a monologue, interviews with guests both famous and offbeat, and 
performances by bands that are likely to be considered edgier and more obscure 
than those invited to the other shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman knows that some of these programs aren't going to click, but he said 
that using first-run programming is less of a financial burden than what 
stations have done in the past: buying off-network sitcoms or movie packages 
for millions of dollars and then running them over and over to make them pay 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that is boring and it's a lot riskier financially, and I just don't want 
to play that game anymore," Feldman said. "You can spend millions for, let's 
say, 'Who's the Boss?,' and you have hundreds of episodes, and what if people 
don't want to see them anymore? If first-run doesn't work, you drop it and go 
on to something else. But if it does work, then you have a franchise, a huge 
hit like 'Ricki Lake' turned out to be."

A RETURN TO NORMANDY, 'WHERE IT ALL BEGAN'; MOVIES: A SEGMENT OF THE WEEK-LONG 
FESTIVAL OF AMERICAN CINEMA FOCUSES ON 'FILMS FOR THE FIGHT,' A REMEMBRANCE OF 
HOW HOLLYWOOD DEPICTED WORLD WAR II. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nazi bombs were exploding in the stage-set streets of Paris when Ingrid 
Bergman leaned close to Humphrey Bogart. "Is that cannon fire," she asked, "or 
is my heart pounding?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, yes, World War II was a memorable, even glorious time, for a very 
patriotic Hollywood. And this week in Normandy, just down the coast from the 
beaches where thousands of Americans died to liberate Europe 50 years ago, 
Hollywood dug into its film vaults to pay tribute to its own role in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Sunday night celebration, as the 20th annual Festival of American Cinema 
opened this week in Deauville, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
honored "Films for the Fight" in a nostalgic soiree that included that scene 
from 1942's "Casablanca" and dozens of clips from "The Longest Day," "Twelve 
O'Clock High," "Mrs. Miniver," "A Guy Named Joe," and other movies of -- and 
about -- that era. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, as the French media is introduced to "Forrest Gump," "Wolf," and 
other films that open soon in France, festival screens also are showing such 
war-time movies as "Follow the Boys," a 1944 feature with Marlene Dietrich; "13 
Rue Madeleine," 1946, with James Cagney; and the 1945 Office of War Information 
film, "True Glory." 
</P>
<P>
 "Normandy is where it all began," explained Jack Valenti, 72, head of the 
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Like some still in show business 
today, Valenti was a soldier in World War II, commanding a B-25 bomber and 
flying 51 combat missions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, the movie industry was vastly different then," Valenti said. 
"Louis B. Mayer and Jack Warner were ferocious patriots. They really believed 
their movies were contributing to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of those movies were wonderful," he added. "But movies don't only 
celebrate the past. They reflect the mood and ambience of the time. And that 
was a war in which there were no doubts. Honor. Duty. Service. Victory. I guess 
we were living in an age of innocence then." 
</P>
<P>
 World War II certainly provided plenty of heroes and villains for Hollywood. 
And it also gave actors, directors and screenwriters the kind of stories with 
passion and tragedy that can only come from true-life drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Hollywood's stars enlisted as soldiers, of course. But the film 
industry also sponsored "canteens," where soldiers could meet their favorite 
stars, and entertainers toured the world in USO shows for the troops. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the stories of valor and sacrifice on the big screen that helped 
inspire a generation of Americans, and, perhaps more importantly, captured the 
memories of that war for later generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Hollywood's biggest boosters was Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who 
encouraged film makers to use their craft to build morale among American troops 
stationed abroad. "The stories and the sets . . . bring home their home country 
vividly to their memories," Eisenhower said in 1942. "Let's have more motion 
pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 Col. W. Mason Wright Jr., chief of the Army's Pictoral Branch in 1942, put it 
this way: "In times of peace, motion pictures are a luxury, but in times of war 
they are a necessity." 
</P>
<P>
 And there was no better time or place to recall those contributions than here 
in Normandy at the end of a summer of anniversaries that began with worldwide 
telecasts of ceremonies on the beaches nearby and ended with parties in the 
streets of Paris last month. 
</P>
<P>
 For festival-goers in France, living so close to the events that Hollywood 
brought to the screen, the retrospective of "Films for the Fight" was an 
often-poignant reminder of why the Allied soldiers are still hailed in Normandy 
as "the liberators." 
</P>
<P>
 "When memory fails, art becomes memory," said Ruda Dauphin, an American 
official with the Deauville festival. "Artists give meaning to suffering and 
complete history." 
</P>
<P>
 But the retrospective also suggested just how important France was to 
Hollywood, which used its back lots to re-create the Occupation in Paris, in 
Normandy and in the small villages that dot this country's splendid 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hollywood was kept good and busy during 1940 to 1945," said Robert Osborne, 
host of the Movie Channel cable television network and emcee for the academy 
tribute. "And no country got as much attention from Hollywood as France." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 people turned out for the tribute at the beachside convention 
center in Deauville. Among the guests were the children and grandchildren of 
Gens. Eisenhower and Omar Bradley; Pamela Harriman, U.S. ambassador to France 
and former daughter-in-law of Sir Winston Churchill, the war-time British prime 
minister 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood was also well-represented, from director Arthur Hiller, whose 20 
feature films include "The Americanization of Emily," to Roddy McDowall, whose 
credits include "The White Cliffs of Dover" and "The Longest Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on hand was Jean-Pierre Aumont, who starred in "The Cross of Lorraine" 
and who earned France's highest military decoration in the Free French Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxine Andrews, who appeared with the Andrews Sisters in "Hollywood Canteen" 
in 1944 and toured with the USO, showed she has retained her vigor as she 
belted out "Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling the Andrews Sisters' first USO mission, she said she had been 
surprised by the tender age of the soldiers. "I did a lot of growing up back 
then," she said. "I realized that what we were doing back in Hollywood was 
playing. What these boys were doing was real. It made me think of the folly of 
war." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Johnson, 78, climbed onto the stage as the audience applauded his romantic 
scenes with Elizabeth Taylor beneath the Arc de Triomphe in the 1954 film, "The 
Last Time I Saw Paris." A stage and screen veteran, Johnson first gained fame 
in wartime classics such as "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," "Battleground" and 
"Two Girls and a Sailor." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson joked that his part in the war had included "flying 200 missions over 
June Allyson's dressing room. It wasn't easy in those days," he said. "I had to 
get up at 5:30 in the morning, go to the studio and kiss Elizabeth Taylor all 
day. It was tough."

<P>
 Robert Harris' "What to Listen for in Mozart" (Penguin paperback: $12) is the 
single best introduction to all classical music and most useful I know of for a 
curious amateur who longs to know more about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' title might be a bit confusing because of its similarity to Aaron 
Copland's splendid "What to Listen for in Music" (Mentor paperback: $5.99). But 
Copland, with his composer's enthusiasm, covers a wider field and deals mostly 
in generalities and sometimes arcane samples. Harris, a CBS radio executive who 
produced a series of music documentaries, focuses solely on a few Mozart scores 
and goes right to the nitty-gritty details of how the compositions are put 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 The first movement of Mozart's "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" serves as the starting 
point. Harris, writing an impressively informed first book, teaches you how to 
read the score. Then he goes over the same opening section (technically called 
the exposition) again and again from different points of view, looking at its 
rhythms, phrase structures, harmonies and the large formal structure.  
</P>
<P>
 You learn how all these elements converge to reinforce each other. 
</P>
<P>
 If this sounds scary and forbidding, relax. Harris writes in an easy, 
reader-friendly style, alerting you to any difficulties ahead and urging you to 
take necessary time out to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants you to listen to the music, and his object is to show you how to 
enjoy the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would take a sociologist to sift through the layers of elitism and 
snobbery that have accumulated on the clear, brilliant surface of classical 
music," he writes in his introduction. "The composers who labored long and hard 
to communicate as simply and directly as they could to their audiences would be 
astonished, if not furious, at the treatment their art receives today." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harris makes good on his promises. He starts you out tapping the basic meter 
of the piece while clapping the differing rhythms of the musical phrases. You 
learn how much rhythmic variety Mozart packs into these passages and how 
balanced and symmetrical they are but also how different so as to avoid 
monotony. 
</P>
<P>
 With the melodic phrases -- the little (usually four-bar) statements out of 
which Mozart builds the piece, he puts "10 separate musical ideas in the first 
two pages, in music lasting less than 90 seconds," Harris writes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And Mozart devotes exactly the same care to the harmonies he uses. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the book's most valuable lessons is its explanation of the critical 
shift from the tonic to the dominant -- the major dramatic event in 
sonata-allegro form, the form most classical first movements are written in. 
Thanks to Harris' elucidation, you will hear this shift clearly and easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Music students probably learn all this somewhere along the line early in their 
studies, but others have to flounder about or just ignore all it. Their loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The author also takes some time out to show how Mozart was dealing with a 
universal musical problem: how to balance similarity (to create musical 
coherence) with surprise (to avoid monotony). He shows how Gershwin faced and 
solved the same problems in writing his hit tune "I've Got Rhythm." Yep, you'll 
appreciate Gershwin more after reading this book, too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harris takes similar looks at the "Haffner" Serenade, the K. 467 Piano 
Concerto (called here the "Elvira Madigan" Concerto after its use in the 1967 
Swedish film) and, in greater detail, the "Jupiter" Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Elvira Madigan" title rankles many serious music lovers, however. Not 
everyone saw the film in its heyday. It may be a great movie, but it doesn't 
seem to surface very much in revivals or film buffs' conversations these days. 
Ironically, linking it to Mozart's score may have given the movie a classic 
stature and immortality it would not have achieved on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris also discusses librettist Lorenzo da Ponte's three operas ("Marriage of 
Figaro," "Don Giovanni" and "Cosi Fan Tutte") and "The Magic Flute." He ends 
with a list of Mozart's 50 best compositions, which, of course, is an arbitrary 
number and inevitably a debatable selection, although anyone's top Mozart 50 
will include many of the works he mentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Relevant parts of the scores are included in the book, so you don't have to 
buy anything else and flip back and forth. But after reading it, you'll 
probably want to buy some of the full scores to apply his lessons on your own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we supposed to hear all this subtlety under the surface of Mozart's 
music?" Harris asks. "Must we hear all of this to fully appreciate his works?" 
The answer is yes, and no.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these effects Mozart clearly wanted disguised; other he probably 
hoped his listeners would hear. Like the man himself, Mozart's music always 
remains somewhat mysterious. He took such pains in his art, almost unbelievable 
pains, to create the most satisfying and rewarding music for us, his listeners, 
yet he hid away some of his most beautiful effects behind veils of subtlety and 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more we can pierce some of those veils, without losing sight of the 
surface that Mozart so lovingly created, the more we can hope to understand the 
true significance of the extraordinary art this great man created."  
</P>
<P>
 Chapters of biography alternate with chapters of musical analysis. The 
biography is generally sound, although scholars are still debating various 
questions such as how poverty-stricken was the composer in his final years and 
what killed him. 
</P>
<P>
 The quotations from Mozart's letters suggest his propensity for scatological 
humor. At the same time, his uncharacteristically voiced depression resonates 
in a letter he wrote in his final year to his wife, Constanze, who had stayed 
at Baden, where he had taken her for its famous medicinal baths: 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot imagine how I have been aching for you all this long while. I 
can't describe what I have been feeling -- a kind of emptiness, which hurts me 
dreadfully -- a kind of longing, which is never satisfied, which never ceases, 
and which persists, nay rather increases daily. When I think how merry we were 
together at Baden -- like children -- and what sad, weary hours I am spending 
here! Even my work gives me no pleasure, because I am accustomed to stop 
working now and then and exchange a few words with you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alas! this pleasure is no longer possible. If I go to the piano and sing 
something out of my opera, I have to stop at once, for this stirs my emotions 
too deeply. Basta! The very hour after I finish this business I shall be off 
and away from here." 
</P>
<P>
 The opera he refers to is the sublime and simple "Magic Flute." 
</P>

CHANNEL 13 STRUGGLES TO REDO THE NEWS; TELEVISION: AFTER FIVE YEARS OF 
DIRECTING THE STATION'S COVERAGE, JEFF WALD SAYS IT'S IMPROVED DESPITE 
PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Five years and millions of dollars later, all Jeff Wald has to show for his 
experiment in creating a local newscast for the "Star Trek" generation is a 
reputation as the station with "the newspeople who stand up." 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's better than "the newspeople who walk around," which is what 
the anchors used to do -- aimlessly, pointlessly, Wald admits -- when KCOP-TV 
Channel 13 unveiled its much-delayed, multimillion-dollar newsroom and attempt 
at a hip-but-serious news style nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's the cynic's view, Wald insists now, just months before his 
five-year contract as KCOP's news director is set to expire. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I arrived, we were the also-rans, a rip-and-read operation practically 
in the Stone Age technologically, and so we have tried to reinvent TV news, and 
that is not an easy thing to do," Wald said. "It takes time to build 
credibility and a news franchise, and I knew that coming in. We had no 
illusions about some quick fix. And if you look at us now, we're light years 
ahead of where we were. We've grown from maybe 30 to 75 people, and the quality 
of the program is immeasurably better. So from a station that was essentially 
invisible, we are certainly on the map. My only regret is that we are not doing 
more news on the air." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, they're doing less. When Wald arrived, KCOP offered an hour of news 
each weeknight at 10. But having made no headway against the news competition 
on KTLA-TV Channel 5, KCAL-TV Channel 9 and KTTV-TV Channel 11, KCOP cut back 
to a half-hour newscast earlier this year in an effort to provide an 
alternative. Every other VHF station in town produces at least three hours of 
news each weekday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, that decision was very hard for me to take," said Wald, who 
before landing at KCOP served as news director at top-rated KTLA.  
</P>
<P>
 Wald had hoped that the lost half-hour at 10:30 would become a newsmagazine 
produced by his department. But that idea has been put on hold, replaced by 
syndicated late-night programming. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, it comes down to a battle of the idealism of a serious news junkie 
who'd like to put on as many hours of news a day as he can and the practicality 
of running a TV station that was the last of the seven VHF stations in the 
market to dive deeply into the news game. 
</P>
<P>
 KCOP, which will become part of the new United Paramount network in January, 
has been doing well both in daytime and prime time with first-run syndicated 
programs such as "The Ricki Lake Show" and "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine," which 
are aimed at young adults -- a demographic prized by advertisers. Those viewers 
supposedly don't watch TV news as much as older viewers, for whom advertisers 
don't pay as much to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, KCOP management thought it could distinguish itself from the 
competition and grab younger viewers with a jazzy, high-tech newscast that 
featured reporters walking around the two-story newsroom, splashy graphics and 
longer-form mini-documentaries. But better ratings never materialized.  
</P>
<P>
 Rick Feldman, the station's general manager, believes the effort was 
worthwhile, though he admits it will be a long time before KCOP recoups the 
huge investment it has made in news over the past few years. In the short term, 
however, Feldman said that the newscast is not yet bringing in enough ad 
revenue to cover the annual news budget, so Wald has been asked to trim his 
costs a bit.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But what about image? TV executives have long purported that localism, 
especially local news, is vital to a station's identity, one of the only ways a 
station can stand out in a TV environment that features scores of viewing 
options -- and KCOP's 2 1/2 hours out of a 168-hour television week, Wald 
believes, are not enough to make an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman, however, is a convert to a different philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Identity is important, but it doesn't have to be local," Feldman said. "I 
think we've come to a point where there is just too much local news. What good 
does it do anyone having every single station on O. J. Simpson in court with 
the same camera? To me, identity comes from putting on programs that people 
want to watch. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to watch us for news, but it's really just another one of our 
programs, something we do to make our station whole. But it's not a signature 
item. We're all going to have to live with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman insists that the station is not going to choose to live entirely 
without news, however. He hopes to produce the local newsmagazine at some 
point. He is not against creating a newscast during the day that doesn't have 
direct competition from another local station -- a move Wald has been 
advocating to help amortize the cost of the news equipment and personnel. But 
Feldman said he will wait to see how his syndicated programs fare this fall 
before making any moves in news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's silly to think you don't want to do news at all," Feldman said. "It does 
give you a presence in the neighborhoods with reporters and trucks. That's a 
big asset. But we just can't look at it as the single thing that creates your 
image or necessarily brings in your big profits."

AMERICAN EXPRESS LAUNCHES NEW CREDIT CARD; FINANCE: THE OPTIMA TRUE GRACE, 
WHICH FEATURES LOWER RATES AND A 25-DAY GRACE PERIOD, IS EXPECTED TO BOOST 
COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Express launched a low-rate, no-fee credit card Tuesday that could 
escalate competition in the industry while signaling a new approach for the New 
York-based travel services company. 
</P>
<P>
 The card, called Optima True Grace, was immediately heralded as a consumer 
breakthrough in part because its variable rate is lower than those on cards 
offered by most of its major competitors. It could spark a new rate war at a 
time when card rates have generally been rising. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the card is expected to spark competition in an important but 
widely misunderstood facet of the credit card market: grace periods, which are 
the period between when purchases are made and when interest charges start to 
accrue. The card will be one of only a few to offer a grace period even when a 
customer has an outstanding balance. Users who carry balances -- about 70% of 
all cardholders -- generally don't get grace periods. 
</P>
<P>
 The new card is also a departure for American Express, which until now has 
offered credit cards with revolving balances mainly as "companions" to its 
charge cards. American Express' charge cards -- the classic green, gold and 
platinum-colored American Express cards -- require consumers to pay off the 
balance each month. 
</P>
<P>
 American Express' True Grace card allows revolving balances and boasts low 
interest rates and fees. However, it will be marketed only to holders of the 
company's other charge cards, which come with respective $55, $75 and $300 
annual fees for the green, gold and platinum. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is clearly going to fan the competitive flames a lot," said Robert B. 
McKinley, editor of CardTrak, a credit card newsletter published in Frederick, 
Md. "This is particularly helpful to consumers because American Express is 
putting heat on an area where there hasn't been any competition at all. Now 
every segment of the market is hotly competitive -- rates, fees and grace 
period." 
</P>
<P>
 The Optima True Grace card will offer a 7.9% interest rate for the first six 
months. After that, the rate will vary, based on banks' prime rate plus 8.75 
percentage points. That would be a 16% rate at today's prime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no annual fee during the first year. After that, the card's $25 annual 
fee will be waived for customers who use the card at least three times 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 But the card's grace period may be the most significant feature, said Gerri 
Detweiler, a Virginia-based credit card consultant who wrote "The Ultimate 
Credit Handbook." 
</P>
<P>
 The True Grace card always provides 25 interest-free days on new purchases -- 
whether the balance is paid or not. Most consumers believe they do get a grace 
period, even when they maintain a balance, McKinley said, but roughly 90% of 
card issuers eliminate the grace period for customers who have a revolving 
balance.  
</P>
<P>
 American Express said it will market its new card through television, print 
and radio advertisements, as well as an aggressive direct-mail campaign. The 
company hopes to woo 1 million new cardholders. Notably, in a clear effort to 
lure away competitors' customers, American Express notes that it will also 
offer 25 interest-free days on transferred balances. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the new card will be offered only to people with good credit. Those 
who fail to pay their bills on time could find their interest rate boosted, 
American Express spokeswoman Gail Wasserman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have more than three late payments in six months will be put into a 
higher-risk "tier." Instead of prime plus 8.75 percentage points, they will pay 
prime plus 12.9%, Wasserman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk tiers are partly in response to credit quality problems that American 
Express encoun tered when it launched its Optima card in 1989. While American 
Express doesn't talk specifics, it's widely known that Optima cardholders 
defaulted in far greater numbers than holders of other types of credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say that good judgment comes from bad experience," said Phillip 
Riese, president of American Express' Cardmember Financial Services Group. "If 
that is true, we now have very good judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 The True Grace card will be the first in a series of new credit cards offered 
by American Express over the coming years, Riese said. It will provide holders 
with a package of benefits, including travel accident insurance and 24-hour 
customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 However, cardholders won't get automatic car rental insurance, frequent-flier 
miles or a variety of other services standard with the classic Optima or 
American Express charge cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many consumers like these extra benefits, American Express said, it 
doesn't expect a lot of shifting by its own cardholders.

SURPRISING SEASON; ONE-TIME EVENTS PERK UP SOUTHLAND TOURISM INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are a few simple measurements of the vitality of the Southern California 
tourism industry that economist Jack Kyser likes to take: 
</P>
<P>
 How many tour buses pull up in front of the Mann's Chinese Theatres, which 
stand directly across the street from Kyser's office at the Economic 
Development Corp. of Los Angeles County? And how many tourists must be 
circumnavigated as they sit or lie on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for a photo 
opportunity with a favorite star? 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, the diesel fumes were thick and "I have had to watch my step 
especially carefully," Kyser quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not, this has been a better-than-OK year for tourism in Southern 
California, which has been languishing during the recession. The earthquake 
took away and the earthquake gave back. Then the World Cup kicked in its share. 
And the weak dollar also chipped in. 
</P>
<P>
 "An awful lot of the world's travelers found themselves having a great time in 
a product with the brand name Los Angeles," said Michael Collins, senior vice 
president of the Los Angeles Convention & Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 But all is not souvenirs and postcards home, particularly in Orange County. 
Underneath this apparent renewed health lies the knowledge that big events do 
not an industry make, that perhaps the tourism business is not doing all that 
well after you eliminate the one-time happenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the region's theme parks, for example, endured a lackluster early 
summer followed by a pickup in attendance tied to new attractions. But most of 
those taking in the local sights were from Southern California, with a 
noticeable drop in international and out-of-state tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The underlying kind of base level of tourism is not there," said Bruce 
Baltin, who follows hotels for PKF Consulting in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The tourism industry measures its well-being, in part, by how busy the area's 
hotels are. In Los Angeles County, occupancy at major hotels was 65.5% for the 
first six months of 1994, up nearly 7% from the same period last year, 
according to PKF Consulting. July was even better, with an occupancy of 72% 
compared to 64% in July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Orange County, hotel occupancy fell 2% during the first six months to 
64.2%. (July figures were unavailable.) "In Orange County, it was not a good 
story," Baltin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles hotels reaped business from the Northridge earthquake, which 
displaced homeowners and brought in armies of insurance adjusters and 
government emergency workers, Baltin said. (Even so, the Jan. 17 earthquake 
eventually will end up costing the area's tourism industry $308 million in lost 
business, another PKF study found.) 
</P>
<P>
 As that windfall began to dissipate, World Cup business began arriving in June 
and July. 
</P>
<P>
 "World Cup turned out to be worse than some people expected and better than 
others expected," Baltin said. Early reports from L.A. hotels indicate that 
August also was a good month because of travelers who had postponed trips to 
avoid World Cup crowds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Convention & Visitors Bureau reported a 4.4% increase in 
overnight visitors for the first six months of the year while the 
Anaheim/Orange County Visitors & Convention Bureau reported a slight decrease. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a steady summer . . . but not a blockbuster," said Elaine Cali, 
spokeswoman for the Anaheim-Orange County bureau. "It's because of the overall 
economy. People are still holding back." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese tourists avoided Southern California through June because of economic 
problems at home and because of fears of violence, said Shiro Monden, general 
manager of Los Angeles-based Japan Travel Bureau International, a large 
operator of tours from Japan. But business has jumped 25% since July as booming 
development in Las Vegas has lured travelers interested in a Nevada-California 
tour, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks to Las Vegas for our business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's amusement parks also say that international tourists stayed home 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 At Disneyland, June was "somewhat disappointing" partly because some 
out-of-town visitors were scared away by the Northridge earthquake, said 
spokesman John McClintock. 
</P>
<P>
 But attendance rose in July and August after the Anaheim theme park introduced 
a parade tied to the hit movie "The Lion King," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have some concerns about international tourism. It appears that is 
not as strong as it was before everything that has happened in recent years," 
McClintock said. "But local attendance was extraordinary and that kind of made 
up the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland just cut admission prices to keep pulling in the locals this fall. 
"It's worked very well for us in good times and bad," McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Studios Hollywood has a tough act to follow: Despite the area's 
continuing woes, 1993 was one of the best in the attraction's history thanks to 
the "Back to the Future" ride introduced that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although international travelers were not abundant, Universal should nearly 
equal last year's level, spokeswoman Joan Bullard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our international business was soft, but we have great hopes that this will 
turn around in the next year," she said. "I think everyone is primed and ready 
to come to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely will come back," said Knott's Berry Farm spokesman Bob Ochsner, 
where attendance was up at least 10%, thanks to the park's new "Mystery Lodge" 
attraction. "It always does." 
</P>
<P>
 But while the tourist industry has hopes for next year, convention business 
will be sharply down at the new $500-million Los Angeles Convention Center next 
year, said Collins of the Los Angeles Convention & Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1995, the convention center will house 10 national association meetings, 
down from 17 this year. The 1994 total dropped after the earthquake when two 
groups canceled and another combined two meetings into one. 
</P>
<P>
 National meetings are booked well in advance and because of the 1992 riots, 
"for all practical purposes we were out of business for half a year," resulting 
in low bookings for 1995, Collins said. Rooms at the Inn

KODAK TO SELL DIAGNOSTICS MEDICAL UNIT FOR $1 BILLION; HEALTH CARE: ANALYSTS 
SAY THE DECISION CAN BE TRACED TO INCREASED CONCERN ABOUT REFORM LEGISLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Eastman Kodak Co. will sell its Clinical Diagnostics unit, a major worldwide 
supplier of diagnostic products, to health care products giant Johnson & 
Johnson for $1 billion in cash, the companies said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination with Johnson & Johnson's Ortho Diagnostic Systems would create 
the third-largest maker of diagnostic products, with about $1 billion in annual 
sales. The products are used in blood donor centers, hospitals, laboratories 
and homes to monitor blood glucose and problem pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak had said earlier that it would sell off its health care businesses. 
Industry observers Tuesday also linked the sale to increased speculation about 
pending health care legislation in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "The core, underlying reason for this deal and others is the grave concern 
that diagnostic procedures will be hit particularly hard as a result of 
whatever health plan is finally approved," said David Anast, publisher of 
Biomedical Market Newsletter in Costa Mesa. "A number of companies, including 
Kodak, are looking to divest their businesses, and others are looking to build 
market share." 
</P>
<P>
 James L. Kelly, chief financial officer of Irvine-based Trimedyne, which 
manufactures a fiber-optic catheter used in diagnostic procedures, said: "It's 
another example of the overall consolidations going on in the medical device 
manufacturing industry. . . . And that's tied in with the overall consolidation 
under way in the health care delivery system." 
</P>
<P>
 A Kodak spokeswoman said the company's diagnostics division has no 
manufacturing plants in Southern California. Johnson & Johnson owns half a 
dozen medical and biotechnology companies in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak's Clinical Diagnostics unit had worldwide revenue of $535 million last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Kodak would transfer to Johnson & Johnson essentially all 
of Clinical Diagnostics' assets, including personnel, patents and technology, 
production equipment and products. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinical Diagnostics would become a unit of New Brunswick, N.J.-based Johnson 
& Johnson, the world's largest maker of health care products. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., would continue to service the unit's 
equipment for Johnson & Johnson customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale is the latest step in Kodak's plan to sell its health care units and 
focus on its core imaging businesses. Proceeds would be used to pay down debt 
and other purposes, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 In late August, Kodak announced the sale of its Sterling Winthrop Inc. 
over-the-counter drug operation to British pharmaceuticals company SmithKline 
Beecham for $2.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It demonstrates our resolve to rapidly achieve our strategic goal of total 
dedication and resource commitment to our core imaging businesses," George 
Fisher, Kodak's chairman, president and chief executive, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson & Johnson said the purchase "fits perfectly" into its strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The acquisition will add important positions in clinical chemistry and 
immunodiagnostics to our existing diagnostics businesses and significantly 
broaden our customer base in the hospital central diagnostic laboratories," 
said Ralph Larsen, chairman and chief executive of Johnson & Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinical Diagnostics has manufacturing, research and administrative facilities 
in Rochester, Cardiff in Wales, Pollards Wood in England and Strasbourg in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson & Johnson said it expects to continue to operate from these sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is subject to regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak has yet to sell its L&F unit, which produces Lysol disinfectant, Resolve 
carpet cleaner and other household and do-it-yourself products. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts previously said the asset sales could add 35 to 40 cents a share to 
Kodak's operating profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Moody's Investors Service Inc. affirmed the ratings on $1.5 billion of Johnson 
& Johnson's debt, even though the deal, along with the company's pending 
$924-million cash purchase of Neutrogena Corp., would temporarily raise its 
debt levels beyond past levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The ratings agency said it expects debt levels to drop due to strong sales and 
earnings growth in Johnson & Johnson's base operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak stock was up $1.125 to close at $51.25 and Johnson & Johnson slipped 
12.5 cents to $50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: IS HILTON HOTELS TAKEOVER TALK JUST SAME ROOM WITH 
DIFFERENT SHEETS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a market hungry for takeover-stock candidates, Hilton Hotels Corp. is again 
showing up near the top of the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton shares soared $7.875 to $66.625 early Tuesday after USA Today's Dan 
Dorfman wrote that an unnamed investor group is looking to buy and break up the 
Beverly Hills-based hotel and casino giant. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Hilton made the unusual move of officially denying that it is in any 
deal talks -- though it would say no more than that -- the stock dropped back 
to close at $64.375, still up $5.625 on the day. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the question of asset-rich Hilton's sale or breakup seems to 
have become a matter of when rather than if. Takeover rumors drove the stock up 
to $74 last winter and riled it again in July. At age 66, Chairman and CEO 
Barron Hilton is widely viewed -- rightly or wrongly -- as open to a deal at 
the right price. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the back of many takeover-stock traders' minds is the painful memory of 
1989, when Barron Hilton first agreed to entertain buyout offers. The stock hit 
$115 that summer largely on the assumption that starry-eyed Japanese investors 
would pay dearly for the Hilton name. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, autumn of 1989 marked the beginning of the end of Japan's "bubble" 
economy, and with it the inflated fortunes of many Japanese industrialists and 
bankers. In the United States, meanwhile, the 1980s takeover binge died that 
fall as the junk bond market collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 By March, 1990, the Hilton company found itself with just one serious buyout 
offer on the table, a bid worth about $76 a share from real estate firm JMB 
Realty. A disappointed Barron Hilton pulled the company off the auction block, 
and the stock tumbled as low as $26.375 in late 1990.

 For arbitragers who make a living betting on takeovers, the massive losses 
incurred in the Hilton stock run-up and subsequent collapse in 1989-90 have 
left a deep scar. "You'd have to be on your third martini before you'd begin to 
think about buying this stock" solely on takeover rumors, one New York arb said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, many Wall Street analysts don't believe that Barron Hilton, who 
owns about 25% of the company's stock directly and indirectly and thus must 
bless any deal, has any overriding reason to sell now. The hotel business is 
booming again after years of room oversupply, and Hilton's plan to leverage its 
casino know-how worldwide holds tremendous potential. Second-quarter earnings 
were up 26% versus a year earlier, and Wall Street expects the firm to earn a 
record $3.13 a share next year, up from about $2.40 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason he (Barron Hilton) would put this company up for sale 
today," argues Bruce Turner, analyst with brokerage Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 The assumption there, however, is that a deal would be Barron Hilton's choice 
as opposed to something forced on him. Though his stock holdings and those of 
his late father's foundation, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, account for 
about 34% of Hilton's total shares, that still leaves the majority in public 
investors' hands. 
</P>
<P>
 A hostile takeover could be messy, especially given the often long approval 
process for change of control of casino licenses. But it wouldn't be 
impossible. With financing for big deals readily available, at the right price 
institutional holders of the stock would undoubtedly cash in regardless of 
Barron Hilton's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the Hilton family) don't own enough to stop" a hostile deal, says money 
manager Robert Bacarella, whose Monetta Financial in Wheaton, Ill., has held 
Hilton stock since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Bacarella says he didn't buy the stock hoping for a buyout, but rather was 
attracted by the fundamentals of the hotel and casino businesses. "I view 
Hilton as a growth company," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of struggling with a horribly overbuilt hotel market in the United 
States, Hilton's occupancy rate for its 240 hotels was 74% in August, the 
highest since the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the company has begun to move aggressively to expand its 
casino business globally, as more countries and states legalize gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton already derives most of its earnings from gaming, mainly in Nevada: The 
casino division accounted for 71% of the firm's $240 million in 1993 operating 
income (on total sales of $1.4 billion). 
</P>
<P>
 Barron Hilton clearly delineated the company's course when he picked 
casino-business veteran Raymond Avansino Jr. as his No. 2 man in 1993. Using 
its five huge Nevada hotel-casino properties as a jumping-off point, Hilton has 
launched a worldwide search for new gaming sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm now operates a New Orleans casino and a Windsor, Canada, facility, 
both in partnerships with other gaming companies. In addition, Hilton will open 
a hotel-casino in Brisbane, Australia, next spring, is bidding on other 
Mississippi River sites and is developing casino projects in locales as far 
away as Uruguay and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 James Schmitt, whose WestCountry Financial in Santa Barbara has long followed 
Hilton, believes the company is finally on the verge of realizing its full 
potential -- something that undoubtedly isn't lost on possible bidders. 
Similarly, Hilton rival Caesars World, another marquee gaming name, also has 
become a rumored buyout target. 
</P>
<P>
 Total up the value of the Hilton franchise name, the Nevada gaming properties 
and the firm's "trophy" hotels such as the Waldorf-Astoria in New York, and the 
assets are easily worth $90 a share or more, Schmitt figures. At that price, 
Hilton would cost a potential buyer $4.3 billion -- a mid-size deal in today's 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 But would Barron Hilton put up a fight against hostile bidders? At a minimum, 
Schmitt says, the 1989 agreement between Barron Hilton and the charitable trust 
that holds 6 million of the late Conrad Hilton's stock stipulates that Barron 
Hilton can't sell out for less than $75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, Schmitt says, the trust is structured so that Barron Hilton 
personally gets a much larger windfall from the trust's shares if he sells 
Hilton sooner rather than later within the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatively, Barron Hilton could simply do what any potential bidder might 
have in mind: Sell off some trophy assets, spin off the non-gaming-hotel 
business as a separate entity or otherwise engineer a financial restructuring 
to realize the company's hidden asset value. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmitt says he doesn't pretend to read Barron Hilton's mind. He simply 
compares Hilton Hotels to entertainment giant MCA Inc., which was forever in 
the rumor mill until it was finally sold for a hefty premium to Japan's 
Matsushita in 1991: "When it (Hilton) gets taken out it will be for full 
value." The Hilton Story 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton Hotels Corp. stock soared to $115.50 in 1989 on takeover speculation, 
but no deal ever occured. Rumors have periodically rocked the stock since then.

 A quarter of a century ago, when audio buffs were still fawning over vinyl and 
videocassettes were but a twinkle in a movie mogul's eye, David Gregg left his 
engineering job to work on a futuristic vision: a plastic disc that could hold 
both sound and video, to be read not by a needle or a magnet, but by a beam of 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg -- who later won four key patents to the optical disc technology that 
underlies compact discs, laser discs and CD-ROMs -- says he has never been 
recognized for his work. Now the 71-year-old inventor has filed a $250-million 
lawsuit in U.S District Court in Los Angeles accusing consumer electronics 
giant Philips Electronics and its advertising agency of stealing credit for his 
invention.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the last decade, various forms of the shiny discs have resulted in 
billions of dollars in sales for consumer electronics firms, foremost among 
them Philips, which has long claimed to be the key innovator in optical 
technology. The firm -- which last week filed a motion to dismiss the case -- 
itself owns more than a dozen patents related to optical discs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg long ago sold the rights to his patents to MCA (for all of $50,000). And 
he acknowledges Philips' contributions to the optical medium. But he insists 
that the Dutch firm has deprived him of the reputation he deserves as the 
father of a technology that has become part of daily life for millions of 
people -- and he aims to reclaim it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a Goliath," says Gregg, the son of a film industry engineer who 
still works out of the same Culver City house where he grew up. "But you know 
my name. And you know who won that fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit is not the first to question who owns what and why in the area of 
optical discs. The Justice Department is currently investigating how Philips 
and Sony Corp. came to dominate the compact disc business by cross-licensing 
each other's patents and jointly charging licensing fees to other firms. 
</P>
<P>
 And nearly every major consumer electronics company is now racing to develop a 
high-density video disc, which would hold a whole movie, cost many times less 
than the current 11-inch laser disc and potentially replace the videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim of the individual inventor against the force of big multinational 
entities has not always gone unrewarded. A few years ago, for example, inventor 
Gilbert Hyatt proved to the satisfaction of the U.S. Patent Office that he had 
invented the microprocessor before Texas Instruments Inc. and Intel Corp. -- 
and began collecting millions in royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 What is different about Gregg's case is that the patents themselves are not in 
dispute. The engineer is seeking something else: recognition -- and $250 
million for having been denied it. But recognition of the kind he wants may not 
compute with the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Philips' motion, "what makes this claim wholly frivolous is 
Gregg's concession that he has no interest in the patents that he allegedly 
invented decades ago. Instead, Gregg now seeks to protect an interest in the 
self-proclaimed honorific 'title' of 'inventor' -- an interest wholly 
irrelevant to the common law." 
</P>
<P>
 Retorts Gregg's attorney, David Steiner: "That's a misapplication of the law. 
What we're talking about is the attribution of inventor, just as Alexander 
Graham Bell is known as the inventor of the telephone. There's major value in 
being known as the inventor of the optical disc. CDs are a big deal. Just ask 
Philips -- they certainly sell enough of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg, proudly displaying for a visitor the different sizes and formats his 
original invention has taken over the years -- he has collected hundreds of 
movies on laser disc, in addition to music CDs, mini-discs and CD-ROMs -- says 
the claims by Philips have distressed him for years. 
</P>
<P>
 He has made a habit of approaching Philips representatives at the engineering 
conventions he still attends, copies of his patents in hand, to urge them to 
bring his concerns back to the firm's headquarters in the Netherlands.  
</P>
<P>
 "I look through the registry and I march right up to them, and I tell them, 'I 
am the sole inventor of the optical disc. Don't you use the word inventor ,' " 
he says. "I'm just an engineer. I'm not going to get an invitation to 
Eindhoven." 
</P>
<P>
 Philips, Gregg says, was interested in his invention -- funded by seed money 
from General Electric -- back in 1967, when he demonstrated it for Philips 
Phonograph Industries President J.L. Ooms. But he never heard back from the 
firm, and in 1968 MCA bought a controlling interest in his Westwood-based 
start-up firm, thus winning the rights to the patents.  
</P>
<P>
 "Lew Wasserman shook my hand, looked me straight in the eye and said, 'I have 
4,000 movies to put on those discs, and they can't be pirated,' " Gregg 
remembers. MCA later formed a subsidiary, Irvine-based Discovision, to exploit 
the technology. Since 1974, Philips and other optical disc manufacturers have 
licensed the patents from Discovision. 
</P>
<P>
 The final straw for Gregg came when his son sent him a videotape of a 
30-minute Philips infomercial, which touted the firm as a pioneer of CD 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 With CD technology now so widespread, and Philips' inventor claims spreading 
beyond engineering circles and into a mass audience, Gregg's agitation 
increased. He was also seeking funding for a new venture -- and he wanted the 
credibility that would be associated with being known as the inventor of the 
CD. 
</P>
<P>
 With his final patent -- applied for decades ago but finally awarded in 1990 
-- in his pocket, he approached a law firm late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the inventor of the optical disc," he says. "They can't rob me of that. 
I simply want credit where credit is due."

JURY ORDERS CHEVRON TO PAY $30.9 MILLION 
</P>

<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court jury Tuesday ordered Chevron U.S.A. Inc. to pay 
$30.9 million in punitive damages to McFarland Energy Inc., assessing a total 
$47.3 million judgment against the oil giant, a Chevron Corp. spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The punitive damages were in addition to $16.4 million in compensatory damages 
awarded last Friday to McFarland, which sued Chevron in 1991 over the sale of 
oil and gas producing properties in the Los Angeles basin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very disappointed in the outcome and we will appeal the case," said Jim 
Hendon, a Chevron spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland officials weren't immediately available for comment on the jury's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will have a huge impact on McFarland, which is a small company that has 
been fairly conservative," G. Bryan Dutt, an analyst with Howard, Weil, 
Labouisse, Friedrichs, said of the initial damage award. "Clearly, from my 
understanding, Chevron unfortunately made a mistake, and I think McFarland was 
acting in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a small property to Chevron and maybe they weren't paying attention, 
and the result is what has happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland claimed its contract with Chevron gave it first option to purchase 
the properties, for which Chevron served as operator. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland's shares closed up 12.5 cents at $6.125 in Nasdaq trading. Trading 
volume of 12,300 shares was more than double McFarland's three-month daily 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a recent restructuring, Chevron U.S.A. was Chevron Corp.'s domestic 
subsidiary for production, refining and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco-based Chevron's stock closed unchanged at $43 a share on the New 
York Stock Exchange. News of the punitive damage award came after the close of 
trading.BREACH OF CONTRACT

SAN DIEGO MISSES $1.6-MILLION PAYMENT TO CITY BONDHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Diego defaulted last week on a $20-million bond issued seven years ago to 
pay for improving the city's river channel, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's finances have been hampered by depleted reserves and depressed 
property values.The land has not generated enough revenue to pay off the debt 
and the property is now worth less than the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the city failed to make a $1.6-million debt service payment to 
about 137 bondholders, and officials said no payment will be made until after a 
City Council hearing expected to take place later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first bond issue to reach this point," said Jack Sturak, San 
Diego's assistant treasurer. "It is the first default of a bond administered by 
the treasurer's office." 
</P>
<P>
 In a July assessment, City Treasurer Conny Jamison warned of a danger of 
ultimate default on the unrated First San Diego River Improvement Project 
Improvement bonds, of which about $20 million worth are outstanding. The 
current appraised value of the land does not exceed $11.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city's bond reserve fund, used to meet earlier bond principal 
and interest payments, has been depleted and contains only $773,000. The city 
owed bondholders about $761,000 in interest and $850,000 in principal as of 
Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have enough in the reserve fund to pay interest only," Sturak said. San 
Diego's next interest payment, due March 2, will total between $736,000 and 
$765,000, Sturak added.

 USX to Raise Steel Prices: The nation's largest steelmaker announced 
much-anticipated price hikes for sheet steel, reflecting the strong market 
outlook for steel.USX-U.S. Steel Group said that beginning in January, it will 
raise prices by $30 a ton for all sheet products, as well as on the base price 
of all plate products, including carbon and high-strength low-alloy. Sheet 
steel, by far the largest steel market, is used in automobiles and appliances. 
USX had remained silent on its pricing plans since June, when AK Steel Holding 
Corp. and Inland Steel Industries Corp. both announced price hikes effective 
Oct. 1.

U.S. ECONOMY MOST COMPETITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States, boosted by its emergence from recession, has replaced 
long-dominant Japan as the world's most competitive economy, according to an 
international study released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore comes a close second in a league table covering 41 developed and 
major developing countries.Japan, wracked by political and economic woes, was 
pushed into third place, the annual World Competitiveness Report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, widely used as a key guide for business and investment, was 
prepared by analysts at the Lausanne Institute for Management Development and 
published with the Geneva-based World Economic Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The IMD defines international competitiveness as "the ability of a country to 
proportionally generate more wealth than its competitors in world markets." It 
compiles its tables from hard statistics and evaluations by business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 About 16,500 executives around the world were surveyed for their views on key 
factors affecting each country's competitiveness, from government policies to 
business infrastructure to management and work force quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The report says the U.S. outlook is clouded by relatively low educational 
standards and poor work force attitudes, as well as the volatility of the 
dollar. The rankings:

 Hollywood Park Backs Compton Casino: Hollywood Park Inc., the company that 
owns the race track and new casino in Inglewood, signed an agreement with 
Compton Entertainment to build a $40-million card club in Compton.Compton 
Entertainment has already won local approval for the controversial club, but it 
was forced to ask for an extension of its construction deadline in June because 
it couldn't line up financing. The club still needs additional approvals, 
including those of state regulators. If approved, construction of the 200-table 
"Pyramid Casino" would begin this year and be completed by the end of 1995.

 Edison, PUC Unit Agree on 1995 Rate Case: Southern California Edison Co. 
announced that it has reached a memo of understanding with the Public Utilities 
Commission's Department of Ratepayer Advocates on the utility's current rate 
request, which sets how much consumers will pay for power in 1995, 1996 and 
1997. Such settlements usually clear the way for the commissioners to approve a 
new rate structure.Under the pact, Edison will accept a $76-million cut in 
revenue in 1995 but can further accelerate how fast it uses ratepayer money to 
pay off the remaining investment in its San Onofre nuclear power plant. The 
utility is preparing for competition under some form of deregulation. Edison 
had asked for a $117-million increase in revenue; the DRA had proposed a 
$151-million cut. The agreement also calls for spending trims in research and 
development and energy conservation programs.

 T-Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury Department sold $11.6 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.58%, down from 4.61% last 
week. Another $11.7 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 4.89%, down from 4.93%.The three-month bill rate was the 
lowest since they sold for 4.43% on Aug. 8. The six-month bill rate was the 
lowest since they averaged 4.75% on Aug. 1. The new discount rates understate 
the actual return to investors: 4.70% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 
bill selling for $9,884.20, and 5.08% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,752.80. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value.

 Continental-Alitalia Alliance Advances: The proposed marketing agreement 
between the U.S. and Italian airlines won tentative approval from the U.S. 
Department of Transportation.Under the code-sharing plan, the airlines would be 
able to sell each other's tickets. They could link end-to-end flights into a 
single long-haul offering, or one carrier could simply sell flights operated by 
another. This allows carriers to sell more tickets, and such arrangements are 
becoming more common in the industry. Continental and Alitalia would be able to 
advertise and sell service between Newark, N.J., and Rome, though Continental 
would operate the flights. The carriers intend to add new service between 
Newark and Milan and between Houston and Rome by early 1995.

 MCI to Offer High-Speed Service: Responding to the growing demand by business 
customers for faster transmissions of voice, video and data, the long-distance 
company plans to offer the service by December.The service is fast enough to 
allow a 90-minute movie to be transmitted in less than three minutes. Slower 
speeds will also be offered. Retail prices haven't been set, but a flat fee is 
expected, an MCI spokesman said. MCI said it will market the service primarily 
to multinational corporations with numerous facilities around the country, 
firms that do scientific research and engineering, and government and 
universities.

VEHICLE SALES CLIMB 10.3% DURING AUGUST; AUTOMOBILES: LIGHT TRUCKS CONTINUE TO 
LEAD STRONG GAINS FOR THE BIG THREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 The major auto makers shook off some of the inventory problems that produced a 
flat July and finished August with sales of cars and light trucks 10.3% ahead 
of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the industry's strength continued to be in light trucks. Dealers can't 
keep enough pickups, vans and sport utility vehicles on hand to meet customer 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co.'s passenger car sales were down 9.4% from August, 1993, and 
Chrysler Corp.'s were down a fraction, but strong truck sales kept both from 
losing ground. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. rebounded from a July report that showed its overall 
vehicle sales down from a year earlier. The No. 1 auto maker's August car sales 
were 18% ahead of last year; truck sales were up nearly 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that's a good recovery," GM executive vice president William Hoglund 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives and analysts agreed that sales are being held down 
somewhat because the manufacturers don't have the factory capacity to satisfy 
demand for better-selling models. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, production of new models is still "ramping up," automotive jargon 
for the slower, start-up phase of building a vehicle when the assembly process 
is being fine-tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still moaning about availability, but it's better," Hoglund said. 
"We're still selling what we build." 
</P>
<P>
 He said GM expects the industry will finish the year with sales of 15.3 
million vehicles, compared to 14.2 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Several car companies will bring high-profile new models to showrooms this 
fall, setting the stage for what many expect to be a strong fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect our momentum to accelerate further starting Sept. 29, when we 
unveil most of our 1995 car and truck lines," said Ford sales and marketing 
vice president Robert L. Rewey. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese car makers showed more growth than the industry as a whole in August. 
Toyota's overall sales led the pack, up 23.4% from a year ago, but Nissan and 
Honda also gained.

JAPAN MARKET ISSUES: TIME RUNNING OUT; TRADE: AMBASSADOR SAYS SANCTIONS HINGE 
ON RESULTS OF HIGH-LEVEL MEETINGS. PRESIDENT CLINTON PLANS TO JOIN EFFORTS FOR 
ACCORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States hopes to resolve several contentious trade issues with Japan 
without resorting to sanctions at the end of the month, but the two sides 
remain far apart, Walter Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondale said the outcome of high-level meetings over the next several weeks 
will determine whether trade deals can be reached by Sept. 30, the U.S.-imposed 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been urging Japan to open its markets, reduce its excessive global 
surplus and deregulate its economy," he told the National Press Club. "This 
will benefit the world, the U.S. -- but most of all, it will benefit the 
Japanese people, who, because of these barriers, now pay an average of 40% more 
for tradable goods and services than do citizens of other industrialized 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Mondale disclosed that President Clinton plans to meet Sept. 27 with Japanese 
Foreign Minister Yohei Kono in New York, where both men will be attending 
United Nations sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Kono is Japan's chief negotiator in the so-called framework talks. The talks, 
aimed at lowering Japan's trade barriers in a number of key areas, have dragged 
on for 15 months with little success. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was scheduled to meet here today 
with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. 
</P>
<P>
 The framework talks are currently focused on insurance, autos and auto parts, 
and Japanese government purchases of medical and telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has said that unless there is agreement on medical and 
telecommunications equipment by Sept. 30, it will begin the process of imposing 
sanctions against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has threatened additional sanctions in other areas under 
Super 301, a revived portion of U.S. trade law that allows the President to 
single out countries determined to have erected harmful barriers to U.S. 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondale said the trade dispute is threatening to spill over and sour other 
aspects of relations between the world's two largest economies. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there has been some progress on the government procurement issue but 
not enough to satisfy U.S. demands. Both sides appeared close to agreement on 
insurance, where American companies are seeking greater access to the vast 
Japanese market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mondale said the two sides remain far apart on U.S. demands that Japan 
lower barriers to sales of American cars and that Japanese auto makers start 
buying more parts from U.S. suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of Americans cars and trucks in Japan rose to 8,291 units in August, an 
82.3% increase over a year earlier, an auto trade group announced Tuesday in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondale said those figures are not a sign of major progress, given that 
American car sales remain a tiny fraction of the Japanese market compared to 
Japan's sizable hold on the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondale said he remains hopeful that agreements can be reached and sanctions 
avoided, but he refused to estimate the odds for success. With the deadline 
approaching, the pace of the negotiations is accelerating. After his meeting 
with Hashimoto, Kantor is due in Los Angeles for a conference with Kono on 
Thursday, in advance of three days of meetings among trade officials from the 
United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union.

 Blue chip stocks snapped a three-session losing streak Tuesday in quiet 
trading, even as long-term bond yields rose again and the dollar weakened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average added 13.12 points to 3,898.70, buoyed 
largely by action in American Express, General Motors and Eastman Kodak stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad market also fared reasonably well, analysts said, given the backdrop 
of a jittery bond market. Though declining issues outnumbered advances by about 
6 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange, broad indexes such as the Standard & 
Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite inched higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume fell to 199.9 million shares, the lowest since July 5, as 
many traders and investors extended their Labor Day weekend holiday or stayed 
away for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem (Tuesday was) a lack of buyers rather than an abundance of 
sellers," said David Holt, director of technical research at Wedbush Morgan 
Securities in Los Angeles. "It's difficult to come back from a three-day 
holiday and start doing anything immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, sellers dominated a slow session. A weak dollar undercut 
bonds, as did lingering worry about inflation after last Friday's August 
employment report. 
</P>
<P>
 That report showed slower-than-expected job creation, but some economists 
nonetheless warn that demand for workers is becoming strong enough to raise 
fears about wage inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond, which rose from 7.45% on Thursday to 
7.49% on Friday, rose further to 7.53% on Tuesday. Shorter-term bond yields 
also rose. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency market, the dollar weakened further against key currencies, 
extending last week's selloff, on rising demand for German marks and pessimism 
about U.S.-Japanese trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading volume was light, which exaggerated the extent of the dollar's moves. 
But U.S. foreign exchange traders returning from the three-day weekend said the 
underlying selling pressure on the dollar was strong. They foresaw little 
reason to buy dollars. The greenback closed in New York at 1.543 German marks, 
down from 1.556 on Friday. It also weakened to 98.64 Japanese yen, down from 
Friday's 99.12. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * American Express surged 1 3/8 to 30 3/8 after the company launched a credit 
card it says is a better deal for users who don't pay off balances right away. 
The stock may also have been helped by recurring takeover rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kodak shares jumped 1 1/8 to 51 1/4 after the company agreed to sell its 
Clinical Diagnostics unit to Johnson & Johnson for $1 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retail stocks were broadly higher on encouraging sales reports from last 
week, as shoppers apparently snapped up back-to-school clothes and other 
merchandise. Nordstrom rose 1 to 46 3/4, J.C. Penney gained 3/4 to 52 3/4, 
Sears added 3/4 to 47 1/2 and Tandy jumped 3/4 to 42. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks also rose on new sales reports, led by GM, up 2 1/8 to 52 1/4. 
Ford added 3/8 to 30 and Chrysler was up 1 to 48 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some technology shares rebounded. FileNet rose 1 to 23, Motorola jumped 1 
1/2 to 53 1/4, Oracle gained 1 1/4 to 42 3/4 and Sybase surged 2 1/4 to 47 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Casino stocks were mostly higher on rumors that Hilton Hotels may be a 
takeover target. Hilton jumped 5 5/8 to 64 3/8, though it denied it was in 
buyout negotiations. Caesars World rose 3/4 to 46 5/8, Mirage Resorts added 3/8 
to 20 1/2 and Casino Magic gained 5/8 to 8 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Echo Bay Mines gained 3/8 to 13 1/4 as gold stocks rose with the precious 
metal amid concern about inflation prompted in part by the August employment 
report. Many investors buy gold as a hedge against cost-of-living increases. 
Sunshine Mining rose 1/8 to 2 1/8 and American Barrick added 3/8 to 23 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the Financial Times 100-share average was hit by renewed weakness 
in British bonds and closed down 36.1 points, or 1.11%, at 3,205.4. Frankfurt's 
DAX average ended down 8.62 points at 2,165.90, while Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei 
average fell 15.20 points to 20,393.98. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican shares closed sharply higher after reversing earlier losses in a 
technical rebound late in the session, analysts said. The Bolsa index gained 
38.04 points to close at a session high of 2,704.07, after earlier falling as 
low as 2,642.72. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Bovespa index rebounded 3.8% after plunging 10.5% on 
Monday, after the country's finance minister resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, the prospect of rising global demand helped crude oil 
futures rebound from steep declines tied to the end Monday of a 2-month-old 
strike by Nigeria's oil workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, October crude fell as low as $17.11 a barrel before rebounding to 
$17.62 a barrel, up 10 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 On other markets, coffee and lumber prices jumped, while cocoa and orange 
juice futures tumbled. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities 
rose 0.76 point to 233.22, the highest level since Aug. 1.

CONTINENTAL OFFERS NEW DISCOUNT FARES; TRAVEL: THE AIRLINE WILL CUT PRICES UP 
TO 50% THIS FALL ON TICKETS FOR U.S. FLIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Bloomberg Business News

<P>
 Continental Airlines said Tuesday that it is offering tickets at a discount of 
as much as 50% this fall, just a week and a half after its last fare sale 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline said it plans to cut fares on U.S. travel for tickets sold Sept. 
7-16, reducing its New York-to-Los Angeles fare to $159 one way, from a regular 
discount fare of $321. 
</P>
<P>
 That discount matches the one Continental announced last month, when it cut 
fares for tickets sold Aug. 12-26. After it announced that sale, most other 
major U.S. airlines matched the discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental said it hopes to keep people flying in the wake of the good summer 
experienced by airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that strong summer traffic was a harbinger of better-than-usual 
demand in the post-Labor Day period as well," said Don Valentine, senior vice 
president for marketing and sales at parent Continental Airlines Holding Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sale is intended to be a follow-up opportunity for everyone who might 
have missed a chance during the summer to lock in a low fare for fall travel," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Continental's load factor, or the percentage of available seats it 
fills with paying customers, rose 1.6 percentage points to 69% for July 
compared to a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first seven months of 1994, the airline's load factor is up 0.7 points 
to 63.3%. It hasn't announced figures for August. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental's latest fare cuts apply to domestic travel between Sept. 21 and 
Dec. 14, stretching the travel period four days from the last sale's cutoff 
date. The fares aren't available on Nov. 23, 27 or 28, Continental said. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic travel tickets must be purchased within 24 hours of making 
reservations, are non-refundable and require a Friday or Saturday night stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are also available for some international flights, including Latin 
America and the Caribbean, the airline said. It did not elaborate.

KIDS' ALLOWANCES CAN STILL BE TEACHING TOOL; FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY ON $11.75 A 
WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA STERN, REUTERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In these competitive times, one group of workers is getting paid more to work 
less: our children. 
</P>
<P>
 New findings from a survey released by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. 
show that most 8- to 12-year-olds do two chores a day, far less than their 
parents did. 
</P>
<P>
 And these chores, notes researcher Rebecca Shahmoon Shanok, are of the "hit 
and run" variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids bop in and do something in a hurry (like empty the trash or vacuum the 
living room) and then they run out," Shanok said. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait -- other findings show that these same speedy workers are earning 
more for their work. 
</P>
<P>
 James McNeal, a marketing professor and kid-money expert at Texas A&M 
University, notes that in the past six or seven years, the amount of money 
children get for household chores has grown -- both in dollar terms and as a 
percentage of their total take. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, McNeal says, kids received 53% of their money as 
no-strings-attached allowances and 15% as payment for services rendered. 
</P>
<P>
 Now those percentages are 45% and 21%, respectively. Grandparents and outside 
work make up most of the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's hit-and-run, trash-emptying 12-year-old might bring in a total of 
$11.75 a week from all sources, estimates McNeal, with about $2.50 of that 
payment for chores. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a good idea? The historical answer is no. For years we've been steeped 
in the idea that putting a price tag on household tasks harms the spirit of 
family cooperation. Now some experts differ. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, it should be tied," McNeal said. "Parents want to teach their 
children the connection of responsibility and work and rewards. Generally, 
that's the correct way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 There's another type of string being tied to allowances today. Kids have a 
much greater role in spending family money, McNeal says. They pick out about 
80% of their clothes, a reversal of the 80% impact Mom had a generation ago. 
They get sent to the store to pick up their own school supplies and rent their 
own video games. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, their allowances are enlarged to cover these added items. Buy too many 
candy bars and you can end up without fashionable footwear or even a notebook 
on your first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a spate of new kid-and-money books on the market that offer different 
takes on these questions. Here are some of their authors' best suggestions for 
balancing familial responsibility with allowances that allow for fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Bodnar, author of "Kiplinger's Money Smart Kids," offers the following 
wisdom: Dole out an allowance in a variety of small-denomination coins and 
bills to help teach the value of money. 
</P>
<P>
 As children get older, give them more responsibility for covering the costs of 
their lifestyles. A 10-year-old can buy snacks and comic books; a 15-year-old 
can kick in for clothes, movie tickets and youth group trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar also suggests the negative-option method of linking money to chores. 
Put your kid's allowance, all in dimes or quarters, in a glass jar. When they 
fail to keep up their regular responsibilities or respond to your request for 
help, remove a coin. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Schiff Estess and Irving Barocas, authors of "Kids, Money & Values," 
advise parents never to link chores and allowances because it lets children 
think they can buy their way out of work. Instead, reward jobs well done with 
extra treats, they suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 When teen-agers are old enough to buy their own clothes, dole the money out 
monthly or by season to help them make it last. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money Doesn't Grow on Trees" by Neale Godfrey advises parents to develop 
allowances using a formula that includes savings, spending and charitable 
donations. A proper balance might be 60% spending, 30% savings and 10% charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Figure out realistic expenses for your child, add in savings and charity and 
pay an allowance that lets them handle all three. 
</P>
<P>
 Godfrey doesn't specifically tie financial amounts to chores, but her 
children's chores must be completed before they get their allowances. 
</P>
<P>
 She also tells parents to tax allowances. These tariffs can go into a family 
kitty that pays for something the entire family can enjoy and use. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, my own allowance tips: Give the kids enough money to buy lunch two or 
three days a week, but lay in a stock of good lunch food. 
</P>
<P>
 If they pack their lunches, they pocket the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when lazy, they can't afford to "eat out" every day. And give kids ages 
10 and up the opportunity to get their money monthly instead of weekly. This 
helps them learn to budget, divide their money into bigger chunks and learn at 
a tender age about that too-much-month-at-the-end-of-the-money syndrome.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; WHEN TO SAY WHEN TO 
CHILDREN USING PCS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The kids of the TV generation, now bringing up the personal computer 
generation, are grappling with new behavioral challenges just as their parents 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 And they're learning that childhood use of a PC -- like sugar, TV and garage 
chemistry sets -- is best when it's done in moderation. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have started looking at how families handle PCs as sales of the 
machines, use of on-line computer services and the sophistication gap between 
parents and children grow. 
</P>
<P>
 They're finding that, like video games, PCs can sometimes be an annoyance to 
parents who believe the machines are taking up too much of their kids' time. 
</P>
<P>
 They also warn that a PC can become a tool for illegal activity, if a child -- 
usually a teen-ager -- is unaware that accessing someone else's computer is 
against the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents and teachers set rules and time limits for using PCs. A few may 
find they must cope with kids who have to be wrestled from the machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that children do to excess is not healthy. A computer is no 
different," said Sally Bowman Alden, executive director of the Computer 
Learning Foundation, a Palo Alto-based publisher of resources about computers 
for parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of balance," she said. "It's no more healthy for a child to do 
nothing but read or do nothing but play soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no hard numbers that say how many kids become so hooked on computers 
that their behavior is viewed as unhealthy. And few suggest that a PC is more 
harmful to a child than it is to an adult who feels compelled to track every 
dollar in personal finance software or who obsesses about the planet's 
eco-system in a SimEarth game. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a while, when they've had their fill of it, they get up and walk away 
from it," said Judith Oser, a mother of two elementary school-age daughters in 
New York. "It holds their attention only so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Many computer executives dismiss criticism about PC overuse by children, 
saying it's better for a child to spend too much time with a PC, which 
stimulates interaction and thinking, than to spend too much time passively 
watching TV. 
</P>
<P>
 But with PC sales to the home growing faster than the overall market, such 
issues are getting more thought by psychologists and other researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Goldberg, a clinical psychologist who practices in the New York City 
area, said a parent should know whether a child is using the machine simply to 
play games or for more creative and educational purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the computer games are rather addictive, just like the old pinball 
machines," said Goldberg, who specializes in helping people get over a fear of 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's quite different than the child who is spending a lot of time with a 
computer and doing constructive things," she said. "One of the important things 
to look at is not just the length of time a child sits in front of the computer 
screen, but what the child is doing during that time."

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; FEDERAL AGENCIES 
CONVERTING TO COMPUTERIZED BIDDING PROCESS; PROCUREMENT: NEW SYSTEM AIMS TO 
OPEN UP ACCESS TO CONTRACTS. PAPERWORK ALSO WILL BE SIMPLIFIED FOR BIDDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Using a laptop computer, a modem and the first finger of the left hand of an 
assistant Treasury secretary, the Internal Revenue Service became an on-line 
shopper. 
</P>
<P>
 George Munoz, the Treasury Department's chief financial officer and assistant 
secretary for management, launched the Treasury's version of the Home Shopping 
Club on Aug. 24 by punching a button to select the best of four bids on a 
contract to supply the IRS with computer software. 
</P>
<P>
 All the bids were submitted via computer. The winner, a small Virginia firm 
named BDS Inc., was notified the same way. It's a procedure all government 
agencies must begin putting into place by next July, according to an executive 
order signed by President Clinton last fall. Full-fledged "electronic commerce" 
programs are to be in place by early in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government, of course, won't be using perky hostesses or the 
television airwaves. Computer mailboxes, bulletin boards and a telephone 
connection are more the bureaucracy's speed. The electronic commerce, combined 
with simplifications of the government's notoriously cumbersome procurement 
procedures, will save the government $22.5 billion over five years by 
stimulating competition for contracts and reducing costs, the Clinton 
Administration has estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 And officials hope to broaden access to government contracts. The federal 
government buys about $200 billion worth of goods and services annually, but 
much of that business seems to flow to a relatively small number of firms that 
are steeped in the mysterious ways of government procurement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope this will encourage all business, particularly small, women- and 
minority-owned business," Munoz said. "The government is ready to do business 
with all those who are ready to use today's technology." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Treasury Department's pilot project, participants can use their 
computers to find out what contracts are available. They place their bids 
electronically and they find out who got the award via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The first $11,464 spent electronically by the IRS bought it off-the-shelf 
software that is available to any business for bypassing the reams of paperwork 
and yards of red tape so common in doing business with the government, Munoz 
said during a stop at a Treasury Department procurement conference in Los 
Angeles (where he put that left forefinger to good use). 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to start it in Los Angeles, because California is known for being 
at the cutting edge of technology," Munoz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying by computer is part of Vice President Al Gore's proposal to "reinvent" 
government while getting the bureaucracy launched on the information 
superhighway. It is supposed to work hand in glove with the Federal Acquisition 
Streamlining Act that Congress is expected to pass this month. The legislation 
would ease the rules on government purchases of less than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all government agencies are supposed to have at least a pilot 
electronic commerce project started this month, it appears that only the 
departments of Treasury, Defense and Interior will make the deadline, said 
Debra E. Sonderman, Treasury's assistant director for small and disadvantaged 
business utilization. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the bureaucracies are not only setting up these new electronic 
procurement systems, they're also trying to coordinate methods of buying with 
one another, said Sonderman, who is also on the board of advisers of the 
president's electronic commerce task force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a Herculean effort," she said. "It's a complex process of getting 
different organizations to agree." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonderman said she thinks electronic commerce will help Treasury Department 
officials meet their goal of boosting purchases from minority- and women-owned 
businesses 30% by the end of fiscal 1995, to a total of $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now companies all across the country can have access to our business," she 
said. "It gets rid of the notion that you have to know somebody in order to get 
your foot in the door with the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
 The folks at BDS Inc. in Sterling, Va., obviously find this a fine idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes a lot of things easier for us," said Jack Littley, vice president of 
BTG Inc., the parent of BDS. "We don't have to go through the normal cumbersome 
delivery order process, where you send in the paperwork and something is 
inevitably wrong and then you have to redo it all and send it again."

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES; THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; 
PATENT LAWYERS OPPOSE BRYSON NOMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES EVANS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any attorney knows it isn't very smart to publicly criticize judges. But some 
intellectual-property lawyers are so angry over President Clinton's nomination 
of William C. Bryson to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington that 
normal self-preservation has taken a back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 By most standards, Bryson's credentials are impeccable: acting associate 
attorney general at the Justice Department, one-time clerk for the late U.S. 
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and recognized expert in prosecuting 
organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But he doesn't have any experience in intellectual-property matters -- and the 
U.S. Circuit Court was created in 1982 specifically to resolve disputes over 
patents and copyrights. Many patent lawyers, in fact, regard this court as 
their personal domain, and they are in high dudgeon over Bryson and the overall 
pattern of appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an outrage to see the circuit being used for political purposes," fumes 
James E. Hawkes, a patent lawyer in Newport Beach. "The ship of technology that 
is pulling this country is being steered by a court with little experience in 
intellectual property." 
</P>
<P>
 Some patent lawyers have gone so far as to call the court a political dumping 
ground, where nominations are made based on the President's need to trade 
favors for congressional votes. Of the 11 judges currently on the court, only 
four have intellectual-property backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have someone (on the court) who can't make the best, well-reasoned 
decisions, who doesn't have insight into the intellectual-property system and 
how it fits into the world scheme, then it's not good for the country," said 
Michael A. Glenn, a patent attorney in Menlo Park, Calif. Two of the country's 
most important exports -- entertainment and technology -- are endangered by 
intellectual-property ignorance on the federal circuit, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, some say that too much expertise can be a dangerous thing.  
</P>
<P>
 "Patent lawyers tend to think that the more patents there are, the better, and 
they tend to think the same way when they're judges," says Robert Kohn, general 
counsel at Borland International, a Scotts Valley, Calif., software company 
that opposes more software patents. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House, for its part, says Bryson is one of the best attorneys in the 
country and points out that only 8% of the federal circuit's caseload deals 
with intellectual property. Nearly half the cases concern federal personnel 
matters or suits against the government.

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY /

 Rather than equip each robot with all the intelligence it needs to do a 
complex job, researchers at the University of Tokyo's Department of 
Mechano-Informatics are developing collections of robots that share "brain" 
hardware via wireless modems. The shared brain consists of a parallel 
processing computer capable of running the control software of many different 
robots. This allows the robots to be agile, since they don't have to lug around 
a massive parallel computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The project features a collection of small, mobile units, each with a single 
specialty. One might carry a video camera, another a flashlight, another a 
gripper. All the robots can assemble at a given time and place and interact to 
form a more complex robot. A vision robot and two gripper-equipped robots could 
cooperate to tie a knot in a string. Each of the robots would be communicating 
with others through the shared brain. After the task was completed, they would 
be used in different configurations to perform different tasks.

 Oil Is Faster Than Water: The petroleum-rich Los Angeles Basin may have more 
oil than previously supposed, according to a computer simulation developed by 
researchers of the University of Illinois and U.S. Geological Survey. Oil 
companies have always assumed that migrating oil settles in "traps" within 
about 10 miles of a known source bed. They assumed that subterranean oil and 
water moved at comparable speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 By using a computerized simulation, University of Illinois geologist Craig 
Bethke found evidence that oil migration is more rapid and occurs more 
efficiently than scientists had believed. Indeed, Bethke says that in some 
instances, oil travels through the sandstone underlying the Los Angeles Basin 
100 times faster than water -- and less oil is lost to ground absorption if it 
moves rapidly. Bethke's research has been supported by funds from a consortium 
of 10 oil companies, three national laboratories, two computer companies and 
the Geological Survey. One result of the simulation work is that oil traps 
identified but not yet explored -- because geologists thought they were too 
distant from the source -- will now be investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Model Factories: The U.S. flat-panel display industry doesn't have much in the 
way of factories, but thanks to Sandia National Laboratories, it will soon have 
a good software model of what operating such a factory might cost. Flat-panel 
displays have been identified by the Clinton Administration as critical to the 
nation's economic competitiveness and military preparedness. The technology is 
used for display screens on portable and notebook computers. Military 
applications include cockpit instrumentation, command and control centers and 
battlefield-portable computer and communications systems. 
</P>
<P>
 A few Japanese companies are producing about 90% of the world's flat-panel 
displays. With no experience in volume manufacturing, U.S. companies will 
continue to be at a severe disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the National Center for Advanced Information Components Manufacturing, 
staffed by representatives of the Sandia, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore 
national laboratories. The center is working on projects with industrial 
partners and developing software tools to help the U.S. flat-panel display 
industry develop cost-efficient equipment and factories.  
</P>
<P>
 The center recently produced a Cost of Ownership software model for operating 
a piece of equipment and is now developing a Factory Cost model to determine 
what it would cost to run a flat-panel display factory. The idea is to produce 
financial models so that businesses can present bankers and other potential 
backers with a realistic picture of how much money is needed to get started. 
</P>
<P>
 Cold Probe, Warm Heart: Tissue damage that can cause arrhythmia (irregular 
heartbeat) is currently treated with medication or electrical burning, but both 
methods have drawbacks. The medication is not always effective and can have 
side effects; electrical burning cannot safely treat enough tissue to cure all 
types of arrhythmia. A third way to treat the problem is to freeze the heart 
tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 Aegis Medical Technologies of San Diego recently signed a cooperative research 
and development agreement with the National Institute of Standards to develop a 
catheter that could be inserted into a vein for freezing the damaged area. 
Attempts to develop such a catheter have been hindered by inability to reach 
sufficiently low temperatures.  
</P>
<P>
 The NIST will work with Aegis to develop heat-exchange and fluid technology to 
design a catheter that can reach temperatures between minus 150 and minus 190 
degrees Celsius.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; THE READER'S DIGEST 
VERSION OF CD-ROM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reader's Digest, one of the biggest names in publishing and a standard bearer 
for the world of print, with more than 28 million copies of the monthly 
magazine sold worldwide, is going interactive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pleasantville, N.Y.-based publishing empire said Tuesday that it is 
joining with Microsoft Corp. to develop home computer programs in the CD-ROM 
format, based on its Reader's Digest books. 
</P>
<P>
 The first multimedia title is scheduled for release in the second half of 1995 
and will be based on information and illustrations from selected Reader's 
Digest reference books, the publisher said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 While neither Reader's Digest nor Microsoft would divulge the title or subject 
of the software, a Reader's Digest spokeswoman said the first CD-ROM would be 
based on the company's publications, which also include Travel Holiday and the 
Family Handyman. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel Holiday is already available to computer users through America Online 
and the Family Handyman can be accessed on CompuServe. 
</P>
<P>
 The new product "is a natural progression" for Reader's Digest, said 
spokeswoman Lesta Cordil, which publishes its flagship magazine in 17 
languages. It will publish a magazine in its 18th language, Polish, shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 While the CD-ROM version of Reader's Digest publications will not replace the 
printed page, it is a way of making the most of the company's products while 
taking advantage of the latest technology, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reader's Digest has the editorial content, but it "didn't have the technical 
know-how" to produce a product for the home computer, Cordil said. Therefore, 
"we went with the best," meaning Microsoft, to help develop and sell the 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 The CD-ROM will be marketed by both companies, through mail order by Reader's 
Digest, and at retail stores by Microsoft. It will carry both the Microsoft 
Home and the Reader's Digest brand names.

FARMERS COUNT ON A NEW CASH CROP: PASTA; AGRICULTURE: IRVINE GROUP IS MARKETING 
FOODS PROCESSED BY NORTH DAKOTA WHEAT GROWERS. GOAL IS TO CUT OUT MIDDLEMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gene Nicholas, a third-generation wheat farmer in North Dakota, is betting 
that the "nice blue boxes" now making their way onto Southern California 
grocery store shelves can help him to secure his family's financial future. 
</P>
<P>
 The containers, which are being marketed in California by CNA Sales Group in 
Irvine, are filled with pasta processed from durum wheat grown by Nicholas and 
more than 1,000 fellow farmers in North Dakota. The wheat is milled and 
processed in a state-of-the-art plant opened last year by Dakota Growers Pasta 
Co. in Carrington, N.D., which Nicholas helped to organize. 
</P>
<P>
 This farmers cooperative -- along with its new line of pasta products in the 
bright blue boxes -- are part of a plan to "get more dollars into the farmer's 
pocket," said Nicholas, a 20-year veteran of the North Dakota Legislature who 
boasts proudly that his sons recently became wheat farmers -- the fourth 
generation for the Nicholas clan. "Rather than simply providing raw material, 
we want to ship finished product," Nicholas said. 
</P>
<P>
 For role models, the cooperative's 1,040 members turn to growers who created 
the Sunkist Growers Inc. and Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. cooperatives. 
"They've done extremely well, better than most farmers . . . because they have 
more control over production and some control over product cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas, who farms 3,000 acres that his grandfather and his wife's 
grandfather once worked, acknowledged that farmers face an uphill battle. Most 
wheat farmers still ship their grain to large processors, including Archer 
Daniels Midland and Cargill Inc., that have dominated the business since 
railroads linked the Dakotas to large Eastern cities in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 The cooperative's plant, which mills wheat and turns it into pasta products, 
pits farmers directly against those corporate giants. Said Nicholas: "Those are 
respected companies that know their business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers are betting that they can reap profits by bypassing the middlemen and 
selling their finished pasta products wholesale to food processors, restaurant 
suppliers and other food companies. They're also fighting for space on 
supermarket shelves for their new line of retail pasta products, including 
ziti, rotini, spaghetti and angel hair, that are packaged in the blue boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 With Pasta Growers Pasta, the cooperative is going head-to-head with retail 
giants such as Borden Inc. and Hershey Foods Inc., who dominate supermarket 
shelves. The new line faces stiff competition: More than 330 new pasta products 
were introduced during the first half of 1994 alone, according to New Product 
News, a Chicago-based trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 But while there's intense competition for grocery store shelf space, the 
cooperative picked a good time to enter the fray, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the food industry segments, only soft drinks have grown faster than 
pasta during the past five years, according to the National Pasta Assn. in 
Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Consumers are gobbling up pasta dishes because they're easy to prepare, can be 
eaten as an entree or side dish and, unlike many healthy foods, they actually 
taste good. According to the National Pasta Assn., pasta production in the 
United States rose to 3.8 billion pounds in 1989, the most recent figures 
available, up from 1.4 billion pounds in 1970.

 "We're the new guys, definitely," said Chet Noblett, founder and president of 
Irvine-based CNA Sales Group. "And it's a tough road. In some stores we're down 
on the bottom shelf, in others, we're in the middle. But we think we offer a 
real value for consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 Better restaurants use homemade pasta for some of their dishes, but for many 
entrees, chefs turn to packaged pasta. And there's a decided difference between 
brands, said Carlito Jocson, a chef at Antonello Ristorante in Santa Ana: "We 
can get pasta that goes for $10 per case, but most chefs prefer a brand where 
the average cost is about $20 per case. You get what you pay for." 
</P>
<P>
 Noblett said Pasta Growers Pasta products are aimed a discriminating cooks who 
are willing to pay 20 cents per package more for better quality. "If you look 
at the food triangle, pasta is the base," Noblett said. "There's no fat, no 
cholesterol. . . . It's virtually the perfect food and it sells itself."

 Despite its grand plans, Dakota Growers Pasta Co. remains a decidedly tiny 
player. Its members can grow and process 3 million bushels of wheat, but, 
collectively, farmers in North Dakota and surrounding states produce nearly 100 
million bushels of durum wheat, most of which is sold to major processors.

<P>
 Despite the odds, Nicholas said, the timing is right for farmers to challenge 
the traditional order.

 "Previous generations came out and settled the land, the next generation 
started cooperative elevators," said Nicholas, who lives in Cando, N.D. "My 
generation now has a totally integrated plant. We can grow it, mill it and send 
it through the noodle plant." Pasta Popularity

PLAZA HOME MORTGAGE TO BE SOLD FOR $120 MILLION; BANKING: FLEET FINANCIAL GROUP 
WILL ACQUIRE SANTA ANA-BASED FIRM, WHICH HAS BEEN HURT BY RISING INTEREST 
RATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Reflecting a continuing contraction in the mortgage banking industry, Plaza 
Home Mortgage Corp. said Tuesday that its directors have agreed to sell the 
company for $120 million in cash to Fleet Financial Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition of fast-growing Plaza, based in Santa Ana, would make Fleet 
the nation's fourth-largest mortgage provider, with $13.4 billion in loans made 
through July this year. It would be the nation's second-largest mortgage 
servicer, billing and collecting payments on $88.2 billion in loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleet, based in Providence, R.I., also would gain a substantial presence in 
California, where it has been conspicuously absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts hailed the transaction as a winning situation for both companies. 
They pointed out that Fleet would become a substantial player in the nation's 
biggest residential real estate market and that Plaza shareholders would 
receive a good price -- $10.125 a share -- for their stock. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the pact boosted Plaza's stock 17% to close at $9.625, up $1.375, in 
Nasdaq trading Tuesday. Fleet's stock rose 37.5 cents a share to close at $40 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole mortgage banking business is very difficult now," said Gary Gordon, 
an industry analyst with the brokerage Paine-Webber in New York, "so everybody 
is having a tough time competing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage banks like Plaza have been hurt as rising interest rates have ended a 
long boom in mortgage refinancing activity that had helped make the industry 
highly profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 While the industry's loan production nationwide is expected to fall by a third 
this year -- from $1.05 trillion to $750 billion -- companies like Plaza that 
rely totally on residential loans have found their volume cut in half, Gordon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luckily for employees and shareholders, commercial banks have a very strong 
interest in mortgage banking," he said. "They see the downturn as their chance 
to get into the industry or expand." 
</P>
<P>
 Among big banks that have bought mortgage lenders are Chase Manhattan Bank in 
New York, which said last month it would acquire American Residential Mortgage 
Corp. in La Jolla for $348 million; and Chemical Bank in New York, which bought 
Margaretten & Co. in Perth Amboy, N.J., for $330 million. Also last month, 
North American Mortgage Co. in Santa Rosa hired an investment bank, partly to 
help it find a potential buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 E. Gareth Plank, an analyst at Mabon Securities in San Francisco, said that 
Fleet, to maintain its position, "really needs to take advantage" of the 
industry's doldrums to acquire good operations like Plaza. "It's also savvy for 
Fleet because it moves them into a market where they have been pointedly 
absent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 John T. French, Plaza's chairman and chief executive, said the company's 
directors felt that "we owed it to our stockholders to test the market." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we had to look at," he said, "is how people our size 
compete with companies like NationsBank and the other banking giants that are 
buying S&Ls and mortgage companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleet, with $48 billion in loans and other assets, said it would use its Fleet 
National Bank subsidiary to acquire Plaza and its subsidiaries: Plaza Home 
Mortgage Bank and Option One Mortgage Corp. Fleet would turn in Plaza's savings 
and loan charter because it does not intend to expand its bank network into 
California, said Eugene M. McQuade, Fleet's executive vice president for 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction, expected to close by year's end, is subject to approval by 
federal banking regulators and Plaza shareholders. A shareholder meeting has 
yet to be set.  
</P>
<P>
 Fleet said it hasn't decided how many of Plaza's 1,140 employees it would 
keep. McQuade said "less than a handful" of Plaza's 40 loan offices in 13 
states would be closed and that Fleet would maintain a strong regional office, 
probably in Santa Ana. But Plaza's loan servicing operations here would be 
relocated to one of Fleet's centers in Milwaukee or Columbia, S.C., he said. 
Plaza has a total of 450 employees in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza has only one full-service savings and loan branch. But it used that S&L 
to launch a mortgage banking operation that grew from scratch in 1985 to become 
the nation's 22nd-largest mortgage provider, with a solid reputation for 
lending money in lower-income and minority areas. It formed its Option One 
Mortgage Corp. subsidiary nearly two years ago to lend to those who don't 
qualify for standard mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza, which made $3 billion in mortgage loans through July this year and is 
servicing $9.2 billion in loans, had been highly profitable until the 
refinancing market turned. It recorded a $9.8-million loss for the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 French, the founder and moving force in the company, had been faced at age 62 
with the prospect of rebuilding the company. Analysts said it would take years 
to get the company back to where it was just six months ago. French is the 
company's largest single shareholder, with a 25.1% stake. If the company is 
sold, he would stand to make as much as $28 million on the deal before taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lean times for mortgage bankers, Plaza still has a structure that 
can generate loans, French said, and that's what Fleet wants. He added that 
Fleet also likes Plaza's mortgage broker network and its Option One subsidiary, 
which has grown even while the company shed 335 employees earlier this year 
from its operations overall. 
</P>
<P>
 French said that institutional investors called him Tuesday after they heard 
about the proposed sale to voice their agreement. "It's a very tumultuous time 
for the economy and for financial services," he said, "and they said they 
thought we were making moves in the right direction." How the Lenders Compare 
</P>
<P>
 Fleet Financial Group Inc.'s acquisition of Santa Ana-based Plaza Home 
Mortgage Corp. would make the newly formed company the nation's fourth-largest 
lender and second-largest loan servicer.

 Action Sports Retailer held its trade exposition last week at San Diego's 
convention center, and show officials described the 14th annual gathering as a 
success. More than 7,200 exhibitors preregistered for space at the show, up 
from 6,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The show included 200 manufacturers who were first-time exhibitors or who had 
returned to the show after a hiatus. "We're seeing a definite resurgence in the 
marketplace," said David Loechner, the director of the trade exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 He pegged the show's strength to an improved economy and more sports 
television programming that features surfing, beach volleyball, skateboarding, 
in-line skating and snowboarding. The Action Sports Retailer show is endorsed 
by the Surf Industry Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The sports clothing exposition included more than 50 manufacturers exhibiting 
snowboarding clothing, boards and accessories for the fast-growing sport. The 
Ski Industries America trade association believes that U.S. consumers spent 
more than $102 million on boards, apparel and accessories during 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Cold As Ice, a Costa Mesa-based company, presented a "girls-only" line of 
snowboarding apparel and accessories. Cold As Ice founder Darcy Lee, an active 
snowboarder, previously designed clothing for companies including Gotcha, Sims 
and Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said she started her own line of women's clothing because "I got tired of 
wearing guys' stuff. I saw the potential for girls getting into the sport. 
We're focusing on ages 15 to 25."

CONSERVING PAINTINGS AND A MUSEUM'S ROLE; ART: LACMA OFFICIALS SAY ITS 
EXHIBITION FOCUSING ON RESTORATION OF TWO 15TH-CENTURY WORKS PROVIDES A CONTEXT 
FOR ART HISTORY AND AN INSTITUTION'S RESPONSIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "From Aragon and Castile: The Restoration of Two Spanish Paintings From the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Art" is one of the smallest exhibitions ever 
mounted at LACMA. Installed for only 15 days through Sept. 18, it is also one 
of the shortest. But, according to the museum's staff, this comparative view of 
two paintings is both big and long in terms of effort and educational value. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizing a window of opportunity -- between major exhibitions of Korean and 
Indian art -- the museum's departments of conservation and European paintings 
and sculpture have collaborated to unite "The Last Supper" (circa 1490) by 
Pedro Berruguete and an unknown artist's "Triptych With Scenes From the Life of 
Saint George" (1425-50). The Berruguete, which was purchased in 1990 with funds 
from the Ahmanson Foundation and put on view the next year, is already familiar 
to LACMA aficionados, whereas the anonymous triptych is making what amounts to 
a debut. Curators say the painting has been exhibited in the past but that it 
has mostly languished in storage since 1950, when LACMA received it as part of 
a bequest from William Randolph Hearst. 
</P>
<P>
 Although painted in the same country and century, the two 15th-Century Spanish 
works appear to have more differences than similarities. But that's the point, 
according to curator J. Patrice Marandel and paintings conservator Joseph 
Fronek. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pairing two paintings that differ greatly in technique, style and subject 
provides a context to explore art historical issues and to demonstrate the 
responsibility we have to the works we acquire," Marandel says. "This is a 
behind-the-scenes show" and "it's the wave of the future," he says, noting that 
museums are making better use of their collections in these days of reduced 
budgets and fewer imported blockbusters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors learn -- from text panels and a brochure -- that the Saint George 
legend is portrayed in a retablo, or altarpiece, probably created near Zaragoza 
in Aragon. Working in egg tempera and gold and silver leaf on wood panels, the 
unknown artist employed an impressive array of techniques to create illusions 
of floral designs on brocade costumes, reptilian textures and dry landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Last Supper," on the other hand, is a sarga, the Spanish term for a 
painting executed in a water-and-glue-base paint on linen. With its dry 
surface, broad strokes and vast (6 feet by 10 feet) dimensions, Berruguete's 
work resembles a fresco. It is thought to have been created for a monastery's 
refectory in Castile, northwest of Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
 Both works have an Italian connection. Berruguete's fresco-like work emulates 
a method of painting on plaster frequently used in Italy. And many scholars 
believe that "The Last Supper" was inspired by Andrea del Castagno's painting 
of the same subject in the refectory of Sant'Apollonia in Florence. As for 
"Saint George," the painting techniques bear similarities to gold ground 
pictures of the Italian Renaissance, but the composition of stacked vignettes 
depicting the saint's mythical life follows Spanish tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Fronek faced completely different challenges in restoring the two paintings. 
In "The Last Supper," he had to remove discolored adhesives that had been 
infused into the linen to attach flaking pigment in a previous restoration 
effort. To patch torn side sections, he added new fabric that he covered with a 
putty-like substance, textured to match the original linen. In keeping with 
current conservation practices, all restorations are applied with the same 
synthetic medium for easy detection and removal.

 "Saint George" was a more straightforward job. While restoring the triptych as 
closely as possible to its original luster, Fronek removed several decades of 
grime along with past restorations that had become discolored. The rewards are 
obvious, he says, pointing out exquisite details that have endured for more 
than 500 years.

 Still, as Marandel says, "you don't just get out some cotton and Ajax to clean 
a painting." 
</P>
<P>
 And that is part of the exhibition's message. "We want the public to know how 
much care goes into the maintenance of the collection," he says.

 As if the post-Labor Day blues weren't enough . . . Southland commuters who 
felt a touch of gloominess Tuesday morning probably weren't cheered up by the 
five SigAlerts they had to navigate around.

 Proof that every story doesn't have an O.J. Simpson angle: Bill Brooks was 
watching a TV report on the Los Angeles Police Department's property storage 
area when the station's reporter saw some boxes labeled 'SIMPSON." 
</P>
<P>
 Must be related to the O.J. case, the reporter said--incorrectly. 
</P>

 "I guess," Brooks said, "she didn't know that Simpson Paper is a large 
commercial paper company."

 Today's special: Eric Rose found this delicacy at a Downtown restaurant. A 
fowl's breath, we suspect, would be spicy enough. But augmented with garlic and 
onions?

 The streak resumes: Don't know if you heard but, a 21-year-old UCLA student 
was arrested for streaking Saturday evening during the Bruins' football game 
with Tennessee in usually staid Pasadena. The nudenik, identified as Gabor 
Fabian, said he was paying homage to the '70s.

 Indeed, young readers may be shocked to find out that many of the oldsters and 
middle-agesters of today were caught up in an epidemic of streaking in the 
early months of 1974 as a sort of spontaneous revolt against winter. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 6 of that year, for instance, a wire service reported that 'thousands 
of nude students romped across the nation's campuses. . . ." A man streaked the 
California Angels opener in 37-degree weather in Chicago. A reader wrote to The 
Times that he had been streaking every morning for years because his newspaper 
delivery man rarely threw the paper near his door.

 Three students who gamboled in their birthday suits at Ambassador College were 
sentenced to probation by a judge who recited an old English saying: "Do 
anything you want but don't do it in the streets or you'll frighten the 
horses."

<P>
 The fad reached its peak during the 1974 Academy Award ceremonies, when an 
artist named Robert Opel appeared briefly on stage in the nude, violating the 
black-tie dress standard. After Opel vanished, Academy Award presenter David 
Niven got in the last word. Niven said the streaker had revealed nothing but 
"his shortcomings."

 Bumper stickers that give us hope: A car in Pasadena was observed carrying

Generation: "Age and Treachery Always Beat Youth and Skill." miscelLAny:

 The United States Shooting Team's 1994 media guide--whose cover is decorated 
with five bullet holes--lists California as the state with the most team 
members--22. All but three of them are from Southern California. Somehow, we're 
not surprised.
