ANOTHER BODY BLOW FOR L.A. SCHOOLS; BUT IMAGINATION (AND MONEY) COULD STILL 
SAVE THE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake severely damaged 100 public schools and forced the 
Los Angeles Unified School District to close all campuses temporarily. Most 
classes will resume next week, but 1,000 classrooms will remain closed. Repairs 
could cost $700 million or more, and that will require massive help from 
Washington and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 However, this emergency also provides an opportunity for educators to rethink 
how to accommodate children in the severely overcrowded district. LEARN -- the 
Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now -- is willing to call 
together business leaders, architects, children's advocates, educators and 
others to find ways to capitalize on the local real estate glut and take 
advantage of empty corporate classrooms at firms such as the Northrop Corp. 
Some companies are already helping. They are lending structural engineers to 
inspect schools. More businesses, and individuals, should volunteer to help our 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 A MATTER OF MONEY: About 100,000 students cannot return to their classrooms 
any time soon because the campuses are unsafe. Most live in the hard-hit San 
Fernando Valley, but about 33,000 of these are bused to Valley schools from 
overcrowded campuses elsewhere. Where will all these children go to school? 
Unfortunately, a severe lack of money limits the district's options. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has said he's willing to help. The State Allocations Board, 
which regulates school funding, can bring about that help by funneling 
available funds to the district now. A special bond issue is another option, 
but even if the voters approved one on the June ballot, those funds wouldn't 
flow to Los Angeles until November. During that interim, the district couldn't 
contract for substantial repairs. Perhaps Sacramento could be persuaded to act 
more quickly if the Los Angeles school board devised a plan that restructured 
and improved the system as it rebuilt schools. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who has promised to help Los Angeles recover from the 
earthquake, is sending Education Secretary Richard W. Riley to inspect the 
schools. And the Federal Emergency Management Agency is identifying federal 
funds for increased operational costs and repairs. The district needs all 
possible outside help because years of budget shortfalls have reduced reserves, 
deferred maintenance and resulted in a shortage of staff needed to repair 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 If money were no object, the school district could lease commercial space 
adjacent to the closed campuses to provide a safe environment close to home for 
the youngsters. That remedy would limit the dislocation caused by the 
earthquake. If Washington and Sacramento quickly provide funds, the district 
might also find new classroom space close to the overcrowded schools that have 
been sending thousands of children on long daily bus rides. Such a solution 
would reduce the risk of transporting children along quake-damaged freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 THE VALUE OF ROUTINE: Schools Supt. Sid Thompson is exploring several 
additional options, like identifying all available seats in the district and 
allowing children from anywhere in the district to attend any school that has 
room, without regard to racial balance. Such open enrollment could provide some 
relief. Thompson also is considering double sessions, extending the school 
year, lengthening the school day, doubling up in classrooms and placing 
portable classrooms outside schools on public property and in private 
buildings. Sacramento must bend the rules to approve some of these tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 To calm down after a major trauma like the Northridge quake, students need to 
return to routine and familiarity. Schools typically provide the needed sense 
of order. With help from Washington, Sacramento and LEARN, the public schools 
can recover and learning can resume.

 A new definition of "To Protect and to Serve": Joyce Foxworth was gridlocked 
on San Fernando Road, trying to make it back to her Lake Elizabeth home in 
north L.A. County, when a Los Angeles police car cruised up. Using a speaker, 
one officer asked: "Does anybody need to go to the bathroom? We will take you 
to the bathroom and we will return you to your car." Foxworth said some 
grateful motorists agreed to be taken into temporary custody.

 More premonitions that escaped notice: We noted the other day that the 
"Jeopardy" desk calendar contains the answer, "All fall down," for its Jan. 17

 Timely jolt: The pendulum clock on the wall of Mac McKean's townhouse in

ice and snow." miscelLAny:

IRAN-CONTRA: IN THE END, TRUTH COUNTS; THOUGH THE GUILTY MAY GO UNPUNISHED, THE 
WALSH REPORT IS IMPORTANT TO THE NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks ago Oliver L. North, Edwin Meese III and Ronald Reagan failed in 
secret, eleventh-hour legal motions to block publication of the Iran-Contra 
report of independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh. Interestingly, attorneys for 
Meese and Reagan had announced shortly before the release that they were 
abandoning any further attempt to block it. Brendan Sullivan, North's attorney, 
who said nothing, did not appeal to the Supreme Court, his one remaining 
option. After the release, Meese and Reagan denounced the report. North and his 
attorney had little to say. 
</P>
<P>
 North has become a multimillionaire because of Iran-Contra, parlaying his 
telegenic defiance of Congress into a career whose most recent phase is a 
planned run for the Senate. Anticlimactic as the report may be, it may yet 
prevent a man it calls "guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of serious criminal 
offenses" from joining the body for which he expressed such contempt. We 
certainly hope so. 
</P>
<P>
 The report of the independent counsel, in short, is by no means unimportant. 
In fact, Walsh might have done the country and his own reputation a service by 
dispensing with prosecution and issuing this report several years ago. Invoking 
"national security," Richard L. Thornburgh, attorney general under George Bush 
and a forgotten but crucial figure in the Iran-Contra investigation, had 
withheld documents Walsh thought necessary for his prosecutions. Key testimony 
had been immunized by Congress. Under the circumstances, Walsh could have 
claimed with considerable impact that the cover-up had succeeded and serious 
prosecution had been foiled, and that he could at that point perform only the 
remaining portion of his mandate: an honest report on what he thought had 
happened, whether or not -- given the withheld documents and immunized 
testimony -- his version could stand up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran-Contra has perhaps been a better teacher of how to do it and get away 
with it than of how to stop it. But one among its lessons may be that the truth 
counts even when the guilty walk.

STITCHING TOGETHER A DISASTER SAFETY NET; CONGRESS SHOULD NOW GIVE SERIOUS 
ATTENTION TO MAKING EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE MANDATORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The time has come for Congress to take a hard look at making earthquake 
insurance mandatory for all homes, apartment houses and commercial buildings in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal would be a minimum level of coverage, with a reasonable deductible, 
for all property owners exposed to such destructive events as last Monday's 
Northridge earthquake. The full scope of the damage produced by that magnitude 
6.6 shaker and its aftershocks can't yet be calculated. What is already clear 
is that only a fairly small percentage of property owners carried earthquake 
insurance. Most of those probably suffered damage below the point where their 
insurance would begin to cover loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the minimum level of insurance more extensive coverage ought to be 
available for those willing to pay higher premiums. The essential need is to 
make the insurance mandatory, just as mortgage lenders require homeowners to 
carry insurance against fire and similar non-seismic calamities. The point of 
insurance is to spread the risk. Limited-coverage mandatory earthquake 
insurance would do that. 
</P>
<P>
 We focus on earthquakes because they are of most immediate concern. But 
Congress should also consider mandating a general form of disaster insurance 
for the nation's property owners, one that would also help offset losses from 
such other brutally destructive events as hurricanes and floods. Again, the 
broader the required coverage the wider the risk could be spread. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, government -- the federal government especially, but in 
some cases state governments as well -- has come to be looked on by many as the 
most important provider of relief following a natural disaster. Governments of 
course have a major and even, initially, a primary humanitarian role in the 
wake of disasters. But government simply doesn't have the resources to 
compensate for disaster-produced property losses. Disaster insurance, paid for 
as all other insurance is paid for, seems to be the best approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea isn't new. Each fresh natural disaster revives interest in it, but as 
the memory of the catastrophe fades so does interest in insuring against future 
such events. Experience has shown that making earthquake and other disaster 
insurance available on a voluntary basis produces only limited participation. 
But disasters don't discriminate between those who have insurance and those who 
don't. That's why Congress should now give serious attention to making such 
insurance mandatory.

ROC TREATMENT OF TIGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Victor Chang deserves recognition for his gallant but nevertheless grossly 
misinformed letter of defense of the Republic of China's treatment of tigers 
(Jan. 8). The wildlife conservation law, ostensibly protecting the tiger, was 
only introduced in Taiwan on June 23, 1989. Therefore to suggest that no cases 
of tiger slaughter occurred in the preceding five years is absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 From mid-1990 and up until less than one year ago, I led an investigative 
team, largely working undercover, researching the blatant disregard and lack of 
enforcement of this law on Taiwan. We discovered restaurants shamelessly 
serving soup brewed from tiger genitalia, illegal farms breeding tigers for the 
catering and pet trade, warehouses containing vast stocks of tiger skins and 
bone. In one case a complete skeleton was assembled in front of me to verify 
the authenticity of the product. And hundreds of pharmacies throughout the 
island openly display and sell tiger parts and derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 All these events were covertly recorded on video film and will shortly be 
shown on the U.S. Discovery channel in a television documentary film entitled 
"The Tigers of Thailand." This secret evidence played a crucial part in the 
certification of Taiwan by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt under the terms of 
the Pelly Amendment last September. President Clinton has deferred the possible 
imposition of trade sanctions against Taiwan, permissible under this act, until 
late March of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The ROC on Taiwan is far from "one of the leaders of wildlife protection in 
Asia," and has, in fact, an international reputation in this regard for which 
it should be justifiably ashamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Only through the publication of such hard-hitting advertisements as the one so 
ungenerously referred to by Chang (Dec. 27), may the American people be 
enlightened as to the true reality behind these issues and be allowed the 
opportunity to debate the question of continued support for Taiwanese imports.

ROSE PARADE ANNOUNCES THEME FOR '95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE DONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1995 Rose Parade will have the theme "Sports -- Quest for Excellence," 
Tournament of Roses Assn. President Michael Ward announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament officials also announced that Ward, 57, had been elected president 
after assuming the top position last June after the death of then-President 
Delmer D. Beckhart. Ward, a former quarterback for Pasadena High School and 
Arizona State University, has been a 33-year volunteer with the nonprofit 
Tournament of Roses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward said the sports-related theme for next year's parade will not be limited 
to traditional, well-known competitions. "We plan to salute the spirit and 
enthusiasm that people have for all types of activities enjoyed throughout the 
world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 106th Rose Parade in Pasadena will be followed by the 81st Rose Bowl game 
featuring the Pacific 10 Conference and Big Ten Conference football champions. 
</P>
<P>
 The game and the Rose Parade will be held on Monday, Jan. 2, because 
Tournament of Roses tradition dictates that the festivities are never held on a 
Sunday. Jan. 1 has fallen on Sunday 16 times in the Rose Parade's 106-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament officials said they are hoping for a peaceful parade. The buildup 
to the 1993 event was marked by protesters pressing for more diversity within 
the tournament hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this year's events, tournament officials added five women and minority 
members to the formerly all-male executive committee and the parade was 
completed without incident.

WARD VALLEY NUCLEAR DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Bravo to The Times for its sensible proposal (editorial, Dec. 27) calling 
for separating the highly toxic, long-lived nuclear power plant wastes from the 
genuinely low-level wastes from medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 In her letter (Jan. 6), Dr. Carol Marcus, criticizing this proposal, fails to 
disclose that she is an active board member of Calrad Forum, the primary 
nuclear industry lobbying organization pushing for Ward Valley. She now claims 
The Times' idea of separating the nuclear power and medical wastes won't work. 
Yet this is what she wrote in her famous letter to the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, only a portion of which was quoted in your editorial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nuclear power utility employees have been told by their corporate leaders to 
remain silent and unseen and let the biomedical and academic sectors 'sell' a 
(radioactive waste) site . . . Numerous times the anti-nuclear environmentalist 
coalition came to various physician members of the Calrad Forum Board of 
Directors trying to make a 'deal.' We could build our (waste) site if we 
excluded waste from nuclear power plants. This could actually have been 
economically feasible in our Compact . . . Due to the cowardice of the nuclear 
industry . . . the nuclear medicine community considered taking up the 
environmentalists' offer and 'ditching' nuclear power in Sept., 1991. The docs 
decided not to abandon their fellow nucleons, and slogged on." 
</P>
<P>
 So now we know what has long been suspected: The nuclear power industry is 
hiding behind the white coats of medicine, trying to sell Ward Valley. 
Furthermore, the alternative of separating the genuinely low-level medical 
wastes from the highly toxic reactor wastes like plutonium is recognized as 
feasible, at least privately, by even the most vehement Ward Valley advocates, 
but they choose to turn down this viable alternative because of their 
ideological commitment to nuclear power.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * Your editorial (Dec. 27) on the segment of radioactive waste currently 
called "low-level" in this country (by definition of the federal government) is 
an insightful analysis of the problem. You also printed a letter (Jan. 6) 
challenging your proposal from Carol Marcus which contained some important 
errors: 
</P>
<P>
 1. There is, as noted in your editorial, a basic distinction between 
biomedical and nuclear power reactor "low-level" radioactive waste. The former 
is truly low-level; some of the latter is intensely radioactive and potentially 
lethal. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Production of medical radionuclides is increasingly from clyclotrons and 
linear accelerators, which produce essentially no radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The radionuclides made in nuclear reactors for medical use in the U.S. come 
from Canada and to a much lesser extent from research reactors owned by the 
Department of Energy, none of which are in California, but in any event their 
waste would not go to commercial disposal sites such as Ward Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Storage to decay is a sensible alternative for short-lived medical wastes. 
It has always been the solution for hospitals and offices performing standard 
patient nuclear medicine examinations, since over 90% of the studies use 
radionuclides which decay to zero in less than one week. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental impact statement for the Ward Valley site is replete with 
errors, including failure to adequately evaluate and prevent the possible 
contamination of our water supply. There is a serious public health risk if 
Ward Valley were to open as planned, receiving large quantities of highly toxic 
materials such as plutonium from nuclear power facilities.

LAKERS COME UP SHORT; PRO BASKETBALL: WITH ONLY EIGHT PLAYERS, THEY GET RUN 
OVER BY THE TRAIL BLAZERS, 111-93. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Lakers took a standing eight-count Friday, partly from being punched 
around and partly from having only eight players left standing in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 A night after upsetting Phoenix with nine available, they lost Tony Smith to a 
sprained left ankle, then faced the streaking Portland Trail Blazers with a 
bench of James Worthy, James Edwards and Kurt Rambis and braced for the impact. 
It came, though without the full force -- a 111-93 defeat before another 
sellout of 12,888 at Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did the layup drills with one ball at one point," Nick Van Exel said after 
getting 13 points and 10 assists while playing 42 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news: The Lakers, off until Wednesday, can heal now. When they do 
return, it will be with only two games next week, both against teams they have 
already defeated on the road, Indiana and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Depleted doesn't begin to describe the Lakers' plight. Sedale Threatt went 
into the starting lineup for the first time this season, replacing the injured 
Smith, who had replaced the injured Anthony Peeler. CBA pickup Reggie Jordan 
was at the game, but he can't play until taking a physical today and signing a 
10-day contract, taking the roster spot that opened when Peeler went on the 
injured list earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers' starting guards -- Threatt, who had 25 points and a career-high 
seven steals in 42 minutes, and Van Exel -- were their only guards. Depth in 
the backcourt was Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
 All this came as the Trail Blazers got some good news -- the return of Clyde 
Drexler after 13 games on the sideline because of a sprained ankle. He went 
right into the starting lineup, which moved Terry Porter to a reserve role for 
the first time this season, and finished with 11 points on two-of-seven 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Any Laker hopes for a second surprising victory in as many nights were quickly 
dismissed. The Trail Blazers, in running their season-best winning streak to 
five games, led by 10 points early in the second quarter and went ahead by 20 
with 1:01 left before halftime. It was 62-43 at intermission, by which time 
Clifford Robinson had 17 of his 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers got as close as 11 points twice in the third quarter, only to be 
turned back before being able to cut the deficit to single digits. They made 
another rally late, but that was against the likes of Reggie Smith, Jaren 
Jackson and James Robinson, and it got them only within 12 with 1:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Elden Campbell led the Lakers with a career-high 27 points. His previous best 
(25) also came at Portland, on March 3, 1992. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers have found some positives amid all the injuries. Doug Christie's 
injury meant a chance for George Lynch, who responded by averaging 15.3 points 
and 8.5 rebounds and shooting 64.3% in four starts before Friday. Anthony 
Peeler being lost for at least a month meant the Lakers got more minutes for 
their best defensive guard, Tony Smith. And Peeler suffering the stress 
fracture meant he hadn't changed the style that helped make his rookie season 
successful by choice. He did it because of the leg injury that had been 
bothering him since the exhibition games. "Now we know why Anthony Peeler 
wasn't driving to the basket and why we weren't getting consistent play out of 
him," Coach Randy Pfund said. "To me, that's a good sign. That's a sign that 
maybe he is still what we thought he was a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Van Exel has already set a team record for three-pointers made by a 
rookie. It took him 37 games to pass the 46 set by Peeler, meaning Van Exel is 
barely off the pace to break the Laker mark of 104 by Magic Johnson in 1989-90. 
Also, when Van Exel scored 29 points last Friday against Charlotte, it was the 
most points by a Laker rookie since Johnson in 1980. . . . The Trail Blazers 
are getting involved in Southern California's earthquake recovery. The team has 
pledged to supply 3,500 gallons of bottled water, and every fan attending 
Tuesday's game at Memorial Coliseum against New Jersey is being asked to donate 
at least $1 toward the relief effort. . . . To clear a roster spot for Clyde 
Drexler, the Trail Blazers put Kevin Thompson on the injured list with 
tendinitis in his right Achilles'.

FORUM IS NO HELP FOR CLIPPERS, 106-90; PRO BASKETBALL: THEY CONTINUE TO 
STRUGGLE, CALL ANOTHER TEAM MEETING AFTER LOSING TO THE CAVALIERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers played like the Lakers after moving to the Forum because of 
possible structural damage to the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble was, the Clippers played like the Lakers of 1994, instead of the 
Lakers of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who might lead the NBA in team meetings, held yet another one 
after losing to the Cavaliers, 106-90, before an announced crowd of 9,298 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least the fans treated the Clippers the way they have treated the 
Lakers, booing them after they fell behind by 21 points with a little less than 
four minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bob Weiss criticized his team for being selfish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play a good basketball game," Weiss said. "We didn't play together, 
and we've got to get to that (point). This is definitely a deterioration over 
what we've been aiming at since our mini-camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we tried to do it as individuals tonight, and I saw some of it in 
(Wednesday night's loss at) Orlando.' 
</P>
<P>
 Informed of Weiss' critique, Clipper guard Ron Harper said: "Listen closely to 
what I say," before uttering a two-word obscenity. "Print that," he added, 
knowing that no newspaper could print the obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
 How can the Clippers play more unselfishly? 
</P>
<P>
 "Just by creating security both on and off the court," center Elmore Spencer 
said. "Security and confidence in knowing that the coaching staff and your 
teammates don't mind you shooting, rebounding, passing and trying to block 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it really showed tonight, because we played one of the most unselfish 
teams in the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Mark Jackson said the Clippers (13-24), who have lost 14 of their last 
18 games, can't snipe at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can pull away and say bad things, but this is the time when you stick 
together," Jackson said. "It's easy when things are going bad to throw stones, 
but we know we have the talent and we just have to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Manning, who had a team-high 21 points and eight rebounds, but missed 11 
of 21 shots, thinks the Clippers could learn a lesson from the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a very unselfish team," Manning said. "There's no question about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Mark Price scored 26 points, making 10 of 12 shots -- including four 
three-pointers -- as Cleveland (18-19) won for the fifth time in its last six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just one of the best point guards in the league," Weiss said of Price. 
"He is quick and he's a good passer and shooter. When he gets on a roll, it's 
hard for anyone to play him really tough." 
</P>
<P>
 With his team trailing by 54-49 at halftime, Weiss benched Spencer and 
swingman Harold Ellis at the start of the third quarter, inserting forwards 
Mark Aguirre and Loy Vaught. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't do much good. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, Price made his first four shots, including two 
three-pointers, and scored 10 points as the Cavaliers took a 72-58 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Latest Danny Manning trade rumor: The Phoenix Suns have offered the Clippers 
Cedric Ceballos and center Oliver Miller for Manning, who could become an 
unrestricted free agent at the end of the season. Manning, who wants to play 
for a championship contender, said he would welcome a trade to Phoenix, which 
lost to the Chicago Bulls in the 1993 NBA finals. "Would I want to go there?" 
Manning said. "Who wouldn't want to go play there?" Manning, who said he 
planned to have his sprained left ankle examined by Dr. Steve Lombardo after he 
experienced swelling following Wednesday night's game at Orlando, said he 
didn't see Lombardo because the swelling had decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Stanley Roberts, sidelined for the season after suffering a ruptured 
right Achilles' tendon on Dec. 4 against the Lakers, had the cast removed from 
his leg. Roberts, who appeared fit, said he might be able to play later in the 
season. "I don't think we have a chance to make the playoffs, so there's no 
need for me to rush back," he said. The Clippers will make an announcement 
Monday about whether they will play their next home game, Thursday against the 
New York Knicks, at the Sports Arena.

VIEWPOINT / LETTERS; RAIDER FANS JUMP EARLY TO PINPOINT THE BLAME FOR 
SEASON-ENDING LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Too many penalties helped Buffalo beat the Raiders. Bill quarterback Jim Kelly 
drew one Raider offside four times. 
</P>
<P>
 How(ie) Long does a player have to play football not to be suckered so badly 
by the opposing quarterback?

 Another typical Art Shell-coached game. 
</P>
<P>
 When the opposing defense puts nine men up on the line, he runs up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Can someone please tell him that when the opposing quarterback has time to sit 
in the pocket and pick the Raiders apart, it's OK to put pressure on him with a 
safety or linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad great players like Hostetler, Brown, Long and others have to play 
for him because he's not capable of letting the team play up to its potential.

 Could there remain any further doubt that this talented Raider team is coached 
by the least talented coaches? 
</P>
<P>
 The second half alone should be proof enough. The Raiders' offense continued 
to run and throw short against an eight-man line. The Raiders' defense never 
blitzed. Why wasn't Long yanked and told no more offside penalties? 
</P>
<P>
 All season long, every fan (and opponent) knew that whenever the Raiders got 
within 10 yards of the goal, it was always run, run, run (maybe pass) and kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Hoss and his gang for bringing us this far, despite Raider coaches 
doing little or getting in the way.

 Ventura Kudos to Murray, Rips for Raveling

 Thanks to Jim Murray for pointing out such an important issue in college 
athletics ("Scholarship Should Be Real Issue," Jan. 16). The universities have 
prostituted themselves in order to receive the lucrative athletic revenue. Now 
the beat they have created is turning on them, threatening to boycott and 
reduce the take.  
</P>
<P>
 Let's stop the farce. Disassociate the teams from the universities. Call them 
the Los Angeles Trojans, Bruins, etc. Pay them as minor league teams and let 
students interested in an education take the spots currently taken up by the 
hired guns. Let the universities get back to their jobs -- educating people.

 Jim Murray, as usual, has brought a sense of sanity to the issue of reduction 
of basketball scholarships, and at the same time, he has exposed those flesh

 Thank you, Jim Murray. I'm an African-American law school student who has had 
his fill of those basketball coaches whose tunnel vision is solely directed at 
slammers and jammers.

<P>
 Please publish the graduation rates for basketball players at schools where 
the coaches are making boycott threats. If the public were aware of the 
ridiculously low graduation rates for African-American basketball players, 
these members of the Black Coaches Assn. would be seen for what they are -- 
self-serving phonies.

 Jim Murray should be fired. How could such an article make front-page news in 
the sports section of the Los Angeles Times? A lot of young boys and girls 
dream of becoming a Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Tom Kite or Gabriela Sabatini. 
These kids work hard every day to try to become the best. Some of the kids may 
be good students and some might just be going to school to attain their goals 
in sports. But the point is, they are in school.

 As a Trojan alumnus, I find it disheartening that George Raveling has chosen 
to drag the university along with him as he advances his own political agenda.  
</P>
<P>
 It is his right to boycott or protest something that he does not believe in, 
but it is wrong to hold USC up to the nation as a model school leading his 
fight without the consent of the USC community. 
</P>
<P>
 I recall a few years ago when four Trojan basketball players balked when their 
head coach was fired and a new coach (Raveling) was brought in without their 
input. Raveling set a deadline for the players to play by his rules, and when 
three out of four did not respond, he took away their scholarships.  
</P>
<P>
 Was Raveling really concerned about their right to have input or about the 
educational opportunities at USC being denied the three young men because of 
his actions, or did he just want things his way?

<P>
 George Raveling started his career at USC by taking a no-nonsense approach 
toward some players who thought they were in charge of the program. Now, Coach 
Raveling thinks he can cow the NCAA by suggesting that its policies are 
reminiscent of slavery. Toting those heavy scholarships all the way to the NBA 
is not what most people think of as slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 We really don't need one more person discovering racism where it doesn't 
exist. Coach Raveling should focus on basketball, or USC should make him the 
same deal he made his malcontent players. 
</P>

 Coach Raveling should be more concerned about the first five men on his 
present team than the 14th man on future teams, if last Saturday's blowout is 
any indication.

<P>
 A boycott in sports is another sign of poor management and leadership. If USC 
takes part in a boycott, Dr. (Steven) Sample and Mike Garrett should boycott 
George Raveling. Raveling has again shown poor coaching and poor player 
development in regards to his supposed four great freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about time Raveling quit his immature sideline antics and put his efforts 
after all these years into learning how to coach.

are male and excel in basketball (basket weaving).

 San Bernardino Color of Her Collar Isn't the Key Issue

 In Randy Harvey's article describing Tonya Harding's background (Jan. 14), he 
stated that her behavior "reflected her blue-collar upbringing." I do not know 
anything about Miss Harding, but I do know class snobbery when I read it. Since 
when is a dysfunctional family life related or limited to blue-collar families? 
Unstable families come in all varieties -- rich and poor and everyone in 
between. Ask Erik or Lyle.

NBA ROUNDUP; PISTONS END LOSING STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Detroit Pistons finally faced a team that's playing even worse than they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting of Joe Dumars and Terry Mills helped Detroit end its 14-game 
losing streak Friday night at Miami, beating the Heat, 118-98. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat lost its seventh in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank goodness," Dumars said. "We needed that win as bad as I've ever needed 
a win since I've been here." 
</P>
<P>
 Dumars scored 35 points and Mills 34, season highs for both. Mills made 14 of 
17 shots and Dumars made 14 of 22, including four three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 A loss would have broken the Pistons' record for the longest losing streak in 
a single season, set in 1979-80. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're in a losing streak like we were, the pressure gets tougher and 
tighter," Detroit Coach Don Chaney said. "It's hard to function. The only way 
out of it is to get a win." 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 106, New York 103 -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 37 points and altered a 
potential game-winning shot by Patrick Ewing with 16 seconds to play at 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing, who had 36 points, missed a 15-footer under pressure from O'Neal that 
could have given New York the lead before the Magic's Nick Anderson made two 
free throws with 9.7 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 91, Dallas 87 -- Sam Perkins scored eight points during an 18-2 run in 
the third quarter at Dallas as the SuperSonics overcame a sluggish start to 
extend the Mavericks' NBA-record home-court losing streak to 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics rallied from a 14-point third-quarter deficit, then held off a 
fourth-quarter charge by the Mavericks to win for the 10th time in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 96, Indiana 95 -- Toni Kukoc banked in a three-pointer at the buzzer 
at Chicago as the Bulls got their 16th consecutive home-court victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller's jumper with 0.8 seconds left gave the Pacers a 95-93 lead 
before Pippen lofted a cross-court pass to Kukoc, who made the shot over 
Derrick McKey. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 113, Charlotte 110 -- Milwaukee got 20 points each from Vin Baker, 
Eric Murdock and Frank Brickowski, and the Bucks overcame an 18-point deficit 
at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 With 3.3 seconds to play, Eddie Johnson, who led all scorers with 29 points 
for the Hornets, inbounded to Dell Curry, who missed a desperation 
three-pointer that would have sent the game into overtime. It was the first 
loss to a sub-.500 team for Charlotte this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 124, Golden State 116 -- The Celtics won a season-high fourth 
consecutive game at Boston after losing 13 of their previous 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics, who ended a team-record seven-game home losing streak Sunday 
night against Denver, turned a 61-50 halftime lead into a 73-52 lead as Dino 
Radja and Dee Brown had six points each in a 12-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 113, Atlanta 111 -- Kenny Anderson's 12-foot basket with 1.3 
seconds to play in overtime lifted the Nets at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the third home loss of the season for the Hawks, but their second 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 112, Sacramento 83 -- Jeff Malone made seven of his nine shots in the 
decisive third period, sparking the Jazz at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz put the game away with a 24-7 run in the third quarter. Jeff Malone 
had 12 points in that stretch and 16 in the period.

 Mats Wilander, returning to the tournament he won three times in the 1980s,

Australian Open match played today.

<P>
 Wilander, 29, making a comeback after nearly two years away from tennis,

 The Swede, now ranked 322nd in the world, used a two-handed backhand and soft 
lobs to frustrate Mronz, ranked 143rd. He got a lot of help from Mronz, who 
double-faulted 10 times, and from a sea gull that distracted Mronz in the final 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 The bird, diving toward the court as Wilander prepared to serve at deuce with 
the score 1-1, screeched just as Wilander hit the ball. The startled Mronz 
watched an ace go right past him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-seeded Thomas Muster also advanced to the fourth round, defeating 
Guillaume Raoux, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. Muster has not dropped a set in the tournament 
and has lost his serve only once in three matches. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 12 Alexander Volkov also won, but No. 14 Karel Novacek was ousted by Lars 
Jonsson. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriela Sabatini, the fourth-seeded woman, dropped only three games while 
defeating Linda Ferrando. No. 8 Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere also was a winner, as 
was No. 9 Mary Pierce, who was presented with a bouquet of roses by a fan after 
her 6-3, 6-2 victory over Sabine Appelmans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know who he is," Pierce said. "Just a good fan, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night, third-seeded Jim Courier outslugged Nicklas Kulti, 6-3, 6-3, 
7-6 (7-1), in a tedious third-round match that lasted 2 hours 41 minutes but 
seemed longer. The baseliners traded jabs until one got sloppy, or into 
position for a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Pete Sampras joined Courier in the fourth round with a 7-5, 6-1, 
1-6, 6-1 victory over Stephane Simian of France.

GOLF; SPRINGER USES LOCAL KNOWLEDGE FOR SHARE OF LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Springer started Friday's second round of the Northern Telecom Open six 
shots out of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But a combination of his seven-under-par 65 and some mistakes by other 
contenders propelled him into a four-way tie for the lead at the halfway mark 
of the $1.2-million tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Vijay Singh, Joe Ozaki and Dillard Pruitt also completed 36 holes at 
nine-under 135. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer, a former University of Arizona golfer, attributed his eight-birdie, 
one-bogey round to knowledge of the 7,148-yard Tucson National layout. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know which greens tend to run, you know what fairways tend to run, stuff 
like that," he said. "You know, where you need to miss the ball, where you can 
favor a certain shot. Having some course knowledge really helps." 
</P>
<P>
 Springer said a 50-foot birdie putt on the 405-yard No. 14 got him going. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled a Michael Jordan," Springer said, making a swishing sound. "A slam 
dunk from 50 feet."

SOUTH COAST LEAGUE ROUNDUP; SLOW AND STEADY WINS LITTLE AGAINST MONARCHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first glance, it appears that Mater Dei's 65-41 victory against Capistrano 
Valley at the Bren Center was just another rout for the top-ranked team in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei guard Miles Simon had 31 points and six assists, and freshman Schea 
Cotton added 14 points to lead the Monarchs (21-0, 5-0 in league). Simon scored 
12 of the Monarchs' 15 points in the third quarter and made a three-pointer in 
a 9-0 run in the fourth quarter that made the score 61-36 with two minutes 
remaining, sending both teams' reserves scampering to the scorer's table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miles just took over in the third quarter," Capistrano Valley Coach Mark 
Thornton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Capistrano Valley, ranked seventh in the county, made it interesting, or 
boring, depending on the point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars (14-6, 3-2) pulled their offense out to the perimeter and 
patiently worked the ball around for good shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy worked early, and the Cougars trailed by only one with 4 minutes 
20 seconds remaining in the first quarter before the Monarchs went to a 1-3-1, 
half-court trap. The pressure defense helped spark Mater Dei's 13-2 run to 
close the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei forced seven turnovers in the first quarter, and Simon had two dunks 
and fed Cotton for a two-hand alley-oop slam to help push the Monarchs ahead, 
19-7. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next two quarters, Capistrano Valley continued the slow-down game plan 
although trailing in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Mark figured that's the best way to stay competitive against us," 
Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight said. "But everyone came to see a basketball game 
tonight. The kids just wanted to play, and it kind of takes the excitement 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 If it wasn't as exciting for some, it was encouraging for Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Puffer finished with 20 points, including four three-pointers, and 
Dinari Bates added 10 points. The Cougars were only outscored, 25-22, in the 
second and third quarters combined and remained in range until the final 
minutes although shooting 33% (14 of 43) from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we did well, and I'm encouraged," Thornton said. "But obviously, 
they're a very good team." 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills 59, San Clemente 57 -- Bob Hefty made a game-winning five-foot shot 
at the buzzer for Dana Hills (10-10, 3-2). Hefty finished with 19 points and 13 
rebounds. Luke Mannix led San Clemente (10-9, 1-4) with 29 points, including 
five three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo 60, El Toro 47 -- Tyler Klaklosh scored 19 points, including 
three three-pointers, Jerry Reid had 13 and Matt Denny added 11 for visiting 
Mission Viejo (7-11, 1-4). Todd Steinert scored 13 points for El Toro (10-10, 
2-3).

CENTURY LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ORANGE GAINS SOLE CONTROL WITH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange's Pat Harris, squeezed into a mass of fans, managed only a few words. 
They were well chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was game of runs and answers," Harris said. "We answered last." 
</P>
<P>
 And loudest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers survived, endured and outlasted third-ranked Santa Ana Valley, 
64-58, before a standing-room-only crowd at Orange Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 They survived the Falcons' relentless pressure. They endured the loss of a key 
starter. They outlasted one final run. And their reward was sole possession of 
first place in the Century League. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams talked -- with actions and words -- throughout. But when crunch 
time came, it was the sixth-ranked Panthers (17-2, 5-0) who walked the walk. 
</P>
<P>
 They trailed by one with 2 minutes 49 seconds left, then scored six 
consecutive points. David Neal's two free throws gave Orange a 60-54 lead with 
1:41 left. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in a game that was one mood swing after another, the Falcons (18-3, 4-1) 
offered one final charge, pulling to within 60-58 before Neal and Harris iced 
the game with free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team has really matured this year," Orange Coach Richard Bossenmeyer 
said. "They always played hard. They've taken that to the next level." 
</P>
<P>
 The air can be a little thin there. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means nothing, unless we take care of business the next (five games)," 
Bossenmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Try telling that to the Orange fans, who swarmed onto the court after the 
game, carting off several Panther players on their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those getting a free ride were: 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, a 6-foot-2 forward, who came into the game averaging less than 10 
points. He scored 19, including 11 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal, the Panthers' point guard, who had the unenviable task of bringing the 
ball up against various pressure defenses. The Panthers turned over the ball 19 
times, but Neal was smooth and got the ball into the right hands, namely those 
of Gil Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales, a somewhat slow, a wee-bit awkward-looking guard, who scored 22 
points. He made five of eight three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their play enabled the Panthers to overcome the loss of center Jason Krauss, 
who suffered a knee injury in the second quarter. He had scored 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a solid team," Falcon Coach Rich Prospero said. "They have solid 
players and they have solid coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange jumped to a 13-4 lead, as Gonzales scored seven points in the first 
four minutes. Their lead extended like a yo-yo, as the Falcons got down, then 
climbed back. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was far from the Santa Ana Valley team that had smothered every 
Orange County team in its path this season. The Falcons' only losses were to 
Lynwood and Bellflower St. John Bosco. 
</P>
<P>
 Olujimi Mann, the Falcons' sophomore point guard, looked every bit a 
sophomore. He was 6 of 19 from the field and 0 for 8 in the fourth quarter. 
With their catalyst struggling, the Falcons' offense meandered. But they kept 
pace with raw talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley chased Orange throughout the first half and finally took 
their first lead, 43-41, at the end of the third quarter. The Falcons went up 
by four to start the fourth quarter, but could not hold it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept calm," Harris said. "We knew we could run our offense. We knew we 
could beat this team." 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena 77, Foothill 64 -- Ryan Villmer had 18 points and 11 rebounds and 
Kirk Jensen added 13 points for visiting El Modena (8-13, 2-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon 49, Villa Park 41 -- John Werhas scored 15 points for visiting Canyon 
(7-11, 2-3).

SEA VIEW LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; SANTA MARGARITA ROLLS PAST TUSTIN, 
55-33 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite having two key players afflicted with the flu, Santa Margarita could 
do no wrong Friday and defeated visiting Tustin, 55-33. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave Santa Margarita (15-4, 7-0 in league) a two-game lead over 
Tustin (12-7, 5-2) in the Sea View League with the teams at the halfway point 
in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now the worst part is that we have to do it all over again," Santa 
Margarita Coach Jerry DeBusk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Santa Margarita learned Friday that its zone defense can be as 
effective as its man-to-man defense. 
</P>
<P>
 With Brian Finneran and Derek Yankoff slowed by the flu, DeBusk employed the 
zone defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't played much zone this season," DeBusk said. "But tonight we were 
able to use it to get those guys a breather, and it just kept working for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tillers were able to hang with Santa Margarita in the first quarter, as 
the teams tied, 10-10. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tustin was held to three points in the second quarter, as the Eagles built 
a 27-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Tustin) has some good shooters, and that scared me," DeBusk said. "I was 
kind of worried they'd get some shots off in our zone defense, but things just 
seemed to work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin went on a 7-0 run to start the second half, but Santa Margarita 
answered with a 7-1 run, taking a 37-27 lead to the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter, Brian Finneran scored four points and had three 
assists, while Brad Finneran scored 10 points, as Santa Margarita put away 
Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Finneran finished with 17 points and nine rebounds, and Brad Finneran 
had 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin's Doug Gottlieb, who scored 42 points against Woodbridge on Wednesday, 
was held to a team-high 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a major concern of ours," DeBusk said. "He and (Jeff) Aguilar are 
tremendous shooters, but the zone was able to hold them." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Sea View League games: 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 54, Corona del Mar 47 -- Greg Foster scored 16 points and Ryan Corbin 
added 15 for Irvine (8-11, 3-4). Irvine outscored Corona del Mar, 20-10, in the 
fourth quarter. Dan MacMillan led Corona del Mar (11-8, 3-4) with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback 65, Woodbridge 59 -- Senior guard Chris Bradshaw led Saddleback 
(7-11, 2-5) with 27 points and 11 rebounds. Mel Lete added 20 for the 
Roadrunners. Chris Talbott had 14 points for Woodbridge (7-11, 1-6). 
</P>
<P>
 University 78, Newport Harbor 76 (OT) -- Dustin White and Ali Amiri each made 
one free throw in the final 19 seconds for visiting University (11-7, 4-3). 
White scored 24 points and Demitrius Zeigler scored 22 for University. Paul 
Tayyar had 20 for the Sailors (10-9, 3-4).

<TEXT>
<P>
 El Dorado scored two second-half goals to defeat Cypress, 3-1, Friday in an 
Empire League boys' soccer game at Cypress High. 
</P>
<P>
 The result left Esperanza and Los Alamitos, both winners Friday, with a slight 
edge in the tight league race.Esperanza is 3-1-1 in league play, Los Alamitos 
2-0-3 and El Dorado, Cypress and Loara 2-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The depleted Centurions (10-5-3) started the game with only three healthy 
reserves, and by halftime, they were down to two after fullback Ken Cody took a 
seat because of a neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress Coach Fred Leininger was so desperate for spare bodies he had backup 
goalkeeper Bryce Brunsting change jerseys with an injured teammate and play the 
second half as a midfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's when the Golden Hawks (7-5-5) swooped in for the kill. 
</P>
<P>
 After a penalty, when teammate Nathan Reish was tripped, El Dorado midfielder 
Brian Hurley hooked a free kick around a wall of Cypress defenders and into the 
right side of the goal for a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the ball was marked up, I saw a spot where I could bend it around the 
wall, and I hit it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurley, who sat out last season after transferring from Servite, also scored 
in the first half and leads the team with 12 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado cushioned its lead about 25 minutes into the second half, when 
Hurley lofted a free kick to the front of the net, and forward Cid Luciano 
headed it past Cypress goalkeeper Daryl Miller. DAN ARRITT

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; TWO RESERVES LEAD SADDLEBACK TO VICTORY OVER ORANGE 
COAST

<P>
 Saddleback started its Orange Empire Conference game at Orange Coast on Friday 
with a big hole in the middle. The Gauchos were without Eric Ambrozich, the 
starting center who is averaging 10 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the game was over, Saddleback had two reserves with soaring 
confidence and a 70-52 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos (15-6, 5-1 in conference) remain tied with Riverside for first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Hinsey and Jeff Rick took over in the post for Ambrozich and each made 
key contributions. Saddleback led, 30-29, at the half but outscored OCC, 23-9, 
in the first eight minutes and were never challenged the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinsey, making his first collegiate start, had 10 points and added seven 
rebounds. Rick had four points and four rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave us a lift," Saddleback Coach Bill Brummel said about Hinsey. "He took 
advantage of the situation. But Jeff Rick also gave us a lift . . . Sometimes 
out of a negative something positive happens. This will make us a better team 
in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick had a key rebound basket to put Saddleback ahead, 40-36, with 15 minutes 
12 seconds left. He was fouled on the shot but missed the free throw. But 
Hinsey got that rebound and went up for a lay-in and Saddleback led, 42-36. 
</P>
<P>
 Tes Whitlock continued to be impressive for Saddleback. He had a game-high 25 
points, including 16 in the second half. He had a basket then added a 
three-pointer to give Saddleback a 47-36 lead with 14:02 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast (11-10, 1-5) missed its first 11 shots, but then made 10 of the 
next 17 in the first half.  
</P>
<P>
 But Saddleback increased the defensive pressure in the second half and OCC 
made six of 27 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played some good defense in the last three games," Brummel said. "It's 
been our salvation." STEVE KRESAL

O.C. COMEDY REVIEW; HUMOR RISING FROM THE ASHES; DENNIS WOLFBERG DRAWS THE 
IRVINE IMPROV AUDIENCE AWAY FROM ITS DOOMSDAY IMAGES OF THE EARTHQUAKE WITH 
VIVID COMIC PICTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Wolfberg has had a great run in his years on the club circuit because 
he's never rubbed our faces in his psychic lesions or wasted our time with 
unremarkable comment posing as discovery. He's obeyed an older show-biz maxim. 
As Shelley Berman said: You owe them something. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a good guy to have around when you need a laugh, as God knows we all do 
right now. He read the weather indoors as he warily edged his way onstage at 
the Irvine Improv on Thursday night, peering at the audience for any evidence 
of cannibal intent, and began, "What a thrill it is to entertain an entire 
community that's lost . . ." (incredulous pause) " 30 billion dollars !" 
</P>
<P>
 The weight of the painful and improbable is not lost on him, he was quick to 
inform us. After all, he'd just returned from a gig at New York University's 
Medical Center, where laughter is a chancy business when it can dislodge you 
from your life support system. "It's one thing to heckle someone, but to 
hemorrhage . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Right away he eased the audience away from its doomsday pictures of the last 
few days with more vivid comic pictures of his own. Wolfberg is a throwback to 
the '50s comedian Sam Levenson; like him, Jewish and a former schoolteacher. In 
Wolfberg's case, in a South Bronx school so tough that the school paper had an 
obit column and his assignments bore the theme "What I want to be if I grow 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Levenson gave the impression that he took up comedy because the stories he ran 
into in day-to-day life were too rich to keep to himself or a small circle of 
friends. Wolfberg does the same thing, but his system is wired into 
fuse-blowing postmodern apocalypse. His eyes bug out, his tongue makes cuckoo 
bird appearances; his whole system seems riven by sharp attacks of 
gastrointestinal squalls that spike his sentences into random italics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met a teacher in Detroit who wasn't just burnt out but charred beyond 
recognition !" And, of his pregnant wife, "(She) retained enough water to 
nautically qualify as an inlet !" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his stuff wasn't new, but it was worth hearing again. No one is better 
at blending hyperbole and indirection into a rich gumbo of language; and most 
of his act seems at some basic level to have been lived before it was whipped 
up into comic phantasms. Wolfberg leaves the club scene in the fall to enter 
stand-up heaven -- a sitcom. He'll be missed. Combat veterans will tell you 
that the movie is fine, but it's the live performance that really gets you. 
</P>

COMIC RELIEF WAS NEITHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comic Relief VI may have been a financial success, but in our view it was a 
cultural disaster ("Comic Relief Sets Record of $6 Million," Jan. 17).It is 
unfortunate that the way to raise money for a worthy cause is by portraying 
obscene, sophomoric comments about human body parts and functions as "comedy." 
Comic Relief offered little that was clever or funny. Billy Crystal and Robin 
Williams have more to offer us than their sponsorship of embarrassing and 
self-degrading performances.

JAZZ FANS PREFER HAYNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To answer Leonard Feather's questions, "Where have all the great jazz singers 
gone?" and "Where are the new jazz singers coming from?" ("We Need a Unique 
Stylist, Not a Clone," Dec. 25), the finest female jazz singer I know of is 
alive and well and right here in Southern California. Her name is Stephanie 
Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although influenced by some great predecessors, she has a unique and 
sophisticated style that is distinctly her own -- no tricks, gimmicks or smoke 
and mirrors but a beautiful, richly textured voice that has matured into a 
finely crafted instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience is held spellbound as soon as the first notes are sung. But she 
doesn't just sing a lyric -- she gets inside of it and lives it. 
</P>
<P>
 She sings in Los Angeles and Orange counties, often accompanied by Dave 
Mackay, at such places as Loews Santa Monica, Lunaria, Jazz Bakery and others.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; TRIBE FUSES SOUTH AFRICAN RHYTHM, ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tribe After Tribe's fine fusion of hard rock and South African rhythm landed 
the trio in a kind of mystic realm Thursday night at the Coconut Teaszer, to a 
shimmering, complex sound somewhere between the epic noise of Led Zeppelin and 
the modern world beat of Peter Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 That trip came via some long instrumental jams between the verses, as if to 
further demonstrate the always astonishing power of a single guitar, bass and 
drum kit.With blond dreads hanging to his chest, guitarist-singer Robbi Robb 
took the band through 90 minutes of charged rock, opening the show with a kind 
of blues-metal number and doing his best Paul Rodgers drawl. 
</P>
<P>
 As on Tribe's recent "Love Under Will" album, the Teaszer show offered a 
convincing musical mix of cultures, played with some finesse by these native 
South Africans. Drummer Chris Frazier was MVP for much of the night, his 
aggressive non-Western beats blending comfortably in the hard rock context. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with his earthquake joke featuring a "Shake, Rattle and Roll" punch line, 
Robb was vaguely self-absorbed on stage, though playing to an audience clearly 
crowded with friends of the band. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the show's end, he put his guitar down to slash at the strings with his 
hair. Silly guitar-hero stuff, but in a band with enough chops and musical 
ideas to make it worth hearing.

JAZZ REVIEW; GIBBS FINDING OWN VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One time-honored way of establishing an individual voice in modern jazz is to 
compose your own pieces, and drummer Gerry Gibbs has taken major steps in this 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the first of two three-night stands Thursday at Club Brasserie, the 
youthful New York-based Gibbs presented spirited modern mainstream originals 
that mostly reached out and drew a listener in, but occasionally didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 These tunes were performed with verve by a first-class quartet -- Gibbs (son 
of renowned vibist Terry Gibbs); Billy Childs, piano; Andy Simpkins, bass, and 
Ravi Coltrane (son of the late John Coltrane), woodwinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs' works were most appealing when he emphasized melody and didn't try to 
be too tricky. For example, "The Adventures of Mr. Fick" began with a jaunty 
New Orleans feel -- Coltrane on soprano sax sounded like a 1994 version of 
Crescent City soprano great Sidney Bechet -- then segued into a comfortable, 
easy-grooving mode for natty solos by Childs and Coltrane. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miss Nedra Wheeler," dedicated to the up-and-coming L.A. bassist, had a 
pleasing, earthy quality about it. Less accessible was the overwritten and 
hard-to-follow "F Train to Bermuda," which mixed a fast straight-ahead feel 
with an edgy calypso mood, and "The Band of Losers," during which the solo 
statements were divided by written sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs performs tonight and again Thursday through Saturday, when Patrice 
Rushen will replace Childs.ZAN STEWART

ART REVIEW; TAME OFFERING OF A POWERFUL ARTIST'S WORK; UC SAN DIEGO EXHIBITS 
ONLY A SMALL SAMPLE OF THE ART OF POLISH SCULPTOR MAGDALENA ABAKANOWICZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEAH OLLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a handful of contemporary Polish artists are known outside their native 
land, and Magdalena Abakanowicz looms the largest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her massive fiber hangings from the 1960s, installations of heaped, knotted 
rope in the '70s and, especially, her crowds of burlap figures from the '70s to 
the present have established her as one of the most evocative visions to emerge 
from postwar Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, a show of recent work at UC San Diego's Mandeville Gallery 
gives only a thin sampling of her work's dense, earthy power. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the themes Abakanowicz has explored with penetrating depth is the 
relationship between the individual and the group, and how traits of the 
individual shift and transmute in group situations. She is not dogmatic in her 
treatment of mass behavior, however, and she resists blanket statements about 
mass obedience that would be all too easy to make after life in 
German-occupied, then Soviet-dominated Poland. Her rows of headless figures 
bespeak deference to authority while they also suggest communal strength and 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 With seven single-figure sculptures, the Mandeville show doesn't muster the 
critical mass necessary to sustain such a dialogue. It shows a softer side to 
Abakanowicz, who models her slim, androgynous figures as vaguely heroic. Their 
ancestors are in ancient Greek statuary, their nearer relatives the attenuated 
bodies of Alberto Giacometti. Abakanowicz's figures stand on tree trunks, 
within open boxes formed by slender iron rods, and on large iron wheels. Most 
are just under life-size, but one, a full-size male figure, stands on a wooden 
beam capped at either end with crudely hewn wooden wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Without heads, and with shoulders pulled back so that their arms are nearly 
behind them or absent altogether, Abakanowicz's figures declare their presence 
starkly but with definite dignity. Modeled in burlap stiffened with resin, 
their skins are richly marked with creases and seams, disparate strands woven 
together into a semblance of unity. The figures have no backs, but stand like 
empty shells, a natural metaphor for the hollowness, both physical and 
spiritual, that racked postwar Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Abakanowicz is not without a vision for the future. Half of the Mandeville 
show is devoted to her proposal (one of four finalists in a city competition) 
for a forest of tree-like habitable structures marking the western entrance to 
Paris. The 25-story dwellings would be covered with vines and powered by wind 
and solar energy. Plans for "Arboreal Architecture" show the vigorous, organic 
forms the buildings would take on the outside and the practical division of 
space within. 
</P>
<P>
 To live within artificial trees sounds at once primitive and futuristic -- a 
return to the cave after having been to the moon. What Abakanowicz proposes in 
a larger sense, as much in her figurative sculpture as here, is a renewed focus 
on the basics: dignified democracy among humans and respectful collaboration 
with the Earth.

HOW LOW CAN TELEVISION SITCOMS GO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am very disappointed that television has sunk so low that it can take the 
horror going on in Bosnia and blithely turn it into sitcom humor. Apparently 
the plight of the Bosnian Muslims is of so little consequence that their pain 
and misery can be trivialized and exploited with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's make a switch here: Instead of "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's" Hilary 
Banks, in pursuit of a news anchorwoman job, uttering, "Now who's this Bosnia 
guy?" (as she did in the Jan. 10 episode), let's have her say, "Now who's this 
Holocaust guy and what's this concentration camp business, anyway?" Not so 
funny anymore, is it?

ROSEANNE RUBBISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently Liz Smith published part of an interview with Roseanne Arnold that 
appears in Vanity Fair ("Roseanne Goes on the Record," Jan. 4).I was appalled 
and sick by the time I finished. To irresponsibly say that any child who is 
abused has a right to kill his parents, no questions asked, opens up a lot of 
possibilities for children who feel that abuse can include not getting their 
own way -- Mom and Dad won't get you that car or clothes, so blow them away. 
Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
 I refuse to watch "Roseanne" anymore. I threw my new copy of Vanity Fair out 
as soon as I saw her on the cover.

GODS AND SATAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kristine McKenna's commentary on the UCLA film series ("Pretty Women, Pretty 
Scary," Jan. 12) wonderfully illuminated many of our society's most regressive 
yet still deeply held beliefs about women. But I'd like to mention one point 
that may have been overlooked: 
</P>
<P>
 The "Cat People" voice-over quoted refers to "an ancient race of people who 
fell away from Christianity and began to worship Satan . . . ." As writers as 
diverse as Ian Illich ("Gender") and Margaret Alice Murray ("The God of the 
Witches") have shown, such "ancient people" in fact often worshiped the gods 
that were widely believed in before Christianity -- gods to which some 
Christians later gave the name of Satan during the persecution of those 
"pagans" who remained loyal to them.

'BLINK'S' APPEAL AT FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reading Kent Black's opening paragraph as to the "sparse crowd" gathered to 
see the movie "Blink" at the closing-night ceremonies of the Palm Springs 
International Film Festival ("U.S. Films Not So Popular at Palm Springs 
Festival," Jan. 18), readers would believe that because it was an American film 
it had no appeal to festival-goers.What Black fails to mention is that the 
screening was a fund-raiser and priced at $35 a ticket, perhaps a prohibitive 
price for many. When "Blink" was shown the next afternoon at regular festival 
prices, the same theater was filled to capacity. I know, I was there and 
enjoyed the thriller!

 Comic Relief VI may have been a financial success, but in our view it was a 
cultural disaster ("It's No Joke: $6.4 Million," Jan. 17).It is unfortunate 
that the way to raise money for a worthy cause is by portraying obscene, 
sophomoric comments about human body parts and functions as "comedy." Comic 
Relief offered little that was clever or funny. Billy Crystal and Robin 
Williams have more to offer us that their sponsorship of embarrassing and 
self-degrading performances.

 After reading "Women at Top in Music" (Jan. 15), I find it difficult to 
believe that JoAnn Falletta would use the word credenza (def., a buffet or 
sideboard, especially one without legs) in reference to music.As a harpist 
whose career has led me to commission, perform and record numerous works by 
women composers, I know their harp music could not be characterized as 
"gentle." Their harp works are all "very strong and very powerful." And if they 
were "full of harp credenzas," just imagine the power and strength of all that 
heavy furniture on the stage!

DON'T TELL THE SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I had not read "The Pelican Brief," so I did not know about the novel's ending 
or any alternative ending ("A 'Brief' Flap Over Surprise Ending," Jan. 6).In 
regard to critics' sadistic desire to sometimes reveal too much of the plot or 
the actual ending, my viewpoint is: In any film with a surprise plot 
development, no critic at any time has any right to divulge the ending or any 
point that would destroy the filmgoer's enjoyment. There are no exceptions to 
this rule.  
</P>
<P>
 Any film critic who violates this rule should forfeit his right to be a 
critic. That would eliminate at least 20% of the mediocrity, which would be a 
good thing.

TV REVIEWS; ALAN BATES REVELS IN SIMON GRAY'S 'UNNATURAL PURSUITS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simon Gray and Alan Bates, the British playwright and actor who together 
gained acclaim in the early '70s with "Butley," a blistering view of academia, 
are ripely reunited again in another dark comedy of a frayed, frazzled, 
intellectual outsider: "Unnatural Pursuits," a stinging comic fantasy about a 
British playwright on tour in the United States with his beloved 
work-in-progress (A&E Sunday, 5 and 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 Produced by the BBC in association with A&E, this North American television 
premiere is a richly observant, always amusing, sometimes hilarious chronicle 
of a besotted, haunted, chain-smoking Brit dramatist named Hamish Partt (Bates, 
who's in top, top form). 
</P>
<P>
 Compelled to open his latest and faintly damned play at a fringe theater in 
London, Partt, despite a doctor's dire warnings about his liver, grabs at the 
chance to re-write his play at a small theater in L.A., which is a cozy art 
deco, onetime neighborhood movie house. Egged on by his over-the-top L.A. 
producer (wonderfully portrayed by Bob Balaban), Bates at first is the classic 
innocent abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing palm-fringed L.A. scenes, with our intrepid playwright billeted 
with his booze and typewriter in a classic-'50s hotel-and-pool "Vertigo"-movie 
atmosphere, begins a crazy backstage journey that veers from L.A. to Dallas to 
ultimately ludicrous triumph in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's semi-autobiographical odyssey (not very far removed from his 
characters' literary bitchiness in "Butley" and "Quartermaine's Terms" -- 
strongly evokes Dylan Thomas' and Brendan Behan's disastrous, gin-soaked trips 
to America (not to mention that fine movie "Reuben, Reuben"). 
</P>
<P>
 Bates' florid face and feverish eyes catch a man made all the more comically 
desperate for being snagged in an American nightmare, down to 
non-English-speaking maitre d's, drop-dead-looking hotel hookers and a tipsy, 
sexually aggressive arts writer (Deborah Rush) who tills the theater beat in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a blown-up road map, complete with sublime musical turns a la 
"Pennies From Heaven," not of glitzy Broadway or prestigious regional theater 
but of small theater's trench warfare -- the con and hype, the egos and 
huckstering producers who exploit Bates' alternately bemused and harassed 
celebrity figure when the visiting playwright's not, in fact, exploiting them. 
(One producer stiffs him with a $2,000 hotel liquor bill.) 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers should find the whole irrepressible adventure irresistible. RAY LOYND

TV REVIEWS; SLEEPY DRAMA IN BLAND 'SMALL TOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its languid pace and homespun feel, "Incident in a Small Town" (Sunday on 
CBS at 9 p.m.) has little trouble capturing the kind of rural ambience 
suggested in its title. This second sequel to the 1991 TV movie "The Incident" 
will most likely appeal to those retiring types whose viewing habits run along 
the lines of "Murder, She Wrote." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, other viewers may find themselves nodding off while watching 
this sleepy drama. Even the movie's two veteran stars, Walter Matthau and Harry 
Morgan, appear less than energized by their respective roles as lawyer Harmon 
Cobb and Judge Stoddard Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie unfolds after Bell's estranged daughter Lily (Stephanie Zimbalist) 
beckons her father to her rural community in Illinois in 1953. She wants legal 
help in dealing with her abusive ex-boyfriend, Frank (David Nerman), who has 
returned in the hopes of establishing a relationship with their illegitimate 
13-year-old son, John (Nick Stahl). 
</P>
<P>
 Lily requests that her father and his old legal partner Cobb obtain a 
restraining order against Frank. But John -- who does not know that he was born 
out of wedlock or that he was conceived during a rape -- desperately wants a 
father and begins to see Frank despite Lily's objections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incident in a Small Town" should gain some steam after an intoxicated Frank 
is killed during a confrontation with Lily. But many of the scenes examining 
the killing represent courtroom drama at its most conventional. 
</P>
<P>
 A harder look at the difficulties faced by a woman in the 1940s and '50s who 
bears a child out of marriage would have helped galvanize this movie. As it is, 
the viewer is simply left to assume that Lily is made a pariah after it is 
publicly revealed that she has always been "Miss" Bell. In addition, the drama 
only takes a superficial look at the rocky relationship between Lily and her 
father. Judge Bell had coldly rejected Lily after she had given birth to her 
illegitimate son. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthau could have been a strong anchor to "Incident in a Small Town" had he 
been better utilized. His aging attorney occasionally flashes an engaging sense 
of humor and an independent streak. Alas, Matthau (playing Cobb for the third 
time) isn't allowed the space to develop his character into someone truly 
memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being hard-hitting and poignant, "Incident in a Small Town" is soft 
and bland. JON MATSUMOTO

FAIRVIEW HOSPITAL TO MOVE OUT 400 CLIENTS BY 1999; MENTAL HEALTH: A BAY AREA 
COURT RULING WILL FORCE RELOCATIONS TO COMMUNITY HOUSING, WHICH DISAPPOINTS 
SOME RELATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fairview Developmental Center plans to move roughly 400 of its retarded 
clients out of a hospital setting and into community housing as the result of a 
legal battle in Northern California that pitted advocates for the mentally 
retarded against some families who wanted their relatives to remain in 
institutions like Fairview. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Francisco Superior Court on Wednesday approved a settlement requiring 
the state to reduce its institutionalized population of mentally disabled from 
6,300 to 4,300 during the next five years. For Fairview, the second-largest 
state hospital, that means 400 of its 1,027 clients will be relocated by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed in 1990 by Protection and Advocacy Inc. on behalf of 14 
individuals and six disability groups. It was later certified as a class-action 
lawsuit and broadened to include all clients living in the state's seven 
developmental centers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to slashing the number of retarded or mentally disabled persons 
who will be allowed to remain in state hospitals, the court agreement requires 
the development of new community housing for 300 people, as well as crisis 
counseling and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm elated. It's been a long struggle," said William Coffelt, 52, who led the 
legal charge after discovering that his son, Billy, then 16, had been badly 
bruised and found in a pool of blood in a bathroom while living at the Sonoma 
Developmental Center, the largest facility in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit contended that the clients or patients in such facilities were 
unable to choose community-based residential living, because California had not 
done enough to provide a sufficient number of such residential facilities, nor 
was it doing what was necessary to ensure proper care in those that did exist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The advocacy group contends that the settlement is the largest of its kind in 
the United States, to be carried out with $334 million in federal Medicaid 
dollars. Previously, those funds could only be used to support people living in 
state institutions. Under the new agreement, the money can be used for 
community-based residential care facilities, according to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Legislature has already set aside $20 million for the first year of 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are about 500 residential-care facilities in Orange County 
that serve developmentally and mentally disabled people. About 6,000 people 
with developmental disabilities are served by the state's Orange County 
Regional Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Community homes are typically in residential neighborhoods and house up to six 
individuals with two full-time staffers. But state officials said clients could 
also live with relatives, with paid roommates or in foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some relatives worry that the patients will be forced into the 
community before they are ready, and into smaller facilities that are not 
equipped to care for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park resident Blanca Wolfenstein is among those who wonder who should 
decide where her 32-year-old autistic son, David, should live: a judge in San 
Francisco, or herself. 
</P>
<P>
 David has been in and out of community housing, and the experience was a 
disaster, Wolfenstein said, compared to Fairview, where the quality of service 
was much better. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, she said, her son's doctor called her at 6 a.m. to tell her David had 
had a seizure. "You'd never find that in community placement," she said. "I 
don't want him to be moved. It's going to be a big fight" if the center 
suggests he be moved, "because David is very happy where he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfenstein is a board member of a statewide coalition of about 2,000 
relatives of retarded clients that tried to block the court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a presumption that residents are better off in community facilities 
rather than development centers," said Keith Hearn, a consultant for the 
California Assn. of State Hospital Parent Councils for the Retarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that over the last five to 10 years, the developmentally 
disabled clients who could be placed in the community have already been placed. 
The people who remain in the centers are the ones who need the centers," Hearn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely disappointed" with the court ruling, said Matt Guglielmo, 
74, of San Marino, whose 31-year-old daughter, Annie, has been living at 
Fairview since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie has Down's syndrome, profound retardation and is legally blind. 
Guglielmo said she cannot speak or chew, needs help getting dressed and 
sometimes has tantrums in which she strikes herself and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe she's in the best place for her. . . . If she is left alone, she 
could be taken advantage of," Guglielmo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffelt disagreed with the critics of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every story of abuse in a state hospital there is a story of abuse in a 
community facility. Where we differ" with the group that tried to block the 
settlement "is that they tried to make state hospitals better; our effort was 
to improve the services in the community," Coffelt said. "People who don't want 
to be (in state facilities) shouldn't have to." 
</P>
<P>
 And no one will be pressured to move, the supporters of the agreement said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe there will be competition among those who obtain the placements, 
not pressure applied to those who don't want to go," said Ellen Rosenblatt, the 
attorney for the advocacy group that filed the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of the court settlement, the state in 1992 launched a project 
to identify those clients who would make good candidates for community living. 
</P>
<P>
 Since August, 1992, 43 people have voluntarily left Fairview with the consent 
of their families and the blessings of the staff, said Dawn Lemonds, the 
project's director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not take chunks of people and plop them in" a facility, Lemonds said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the $91,000 in state and federal funds spent each year for each 
patient could be cut in half if they lived in the community, Lemonds said, 
adding that in her opinion, their quality of life would likely improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know of a significant number of people (at Fairview) whose parents gravely 
object to them being placed in the community," Lemonds said. But she tries to 
encourage them to consider the options by saying, "Please come with me and look 
(at the housing) before you say 'No.' "

MUDDYING THE WATERS FURTHER; LACK OF HEARING ON REPORT RENEWS BOLSA CHICA 
DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bolsa Chica wetlands are pretty lively this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the air above the huge marsh along Pacific Coast Highway, a host of 
migratory birds -- including peregrine falcons, brown pelicans and 
black-shouldered kites -- flutter overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the shallow green waters of the wetlands, sea slugs and horn snails 
wallow in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as lively as the wildlife is the controversy regarding the 
development of the wetlands, rekindled by the county's release last month of an 
environmental impact report that was two years in the making. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy is no stranger to Bolsa Chica. It has been part and parcel of this 
landscape for years, as a succession of developers has come forward with 
various plans for the area's future. Each in turn has been shouted down by a 
host of environmentalists and community residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Now under consideration is a proposal from the Koll Real Estate Group, owner 
of the land in question, with a new twist on an old theme: In exchange for 
permission to build 4,286 homes on 400 acres of the site, the company says, it 
will spend $48 million to restore 1,100 acres of wetlands by constructing a 
tidal inlet to the ocean to reinvigorate the marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to prove that our plan is the most feasible and the  
</P>
<P>
 only alternative for saving wetlands that are dying," said Lucy Dunn, the 
company's senior vice president. "It is our mission to do this clean and 
correct." 
</P>
<P>
 But the leading opponents of the project, the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, 
challenge that notion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe it is one ecosystem," said Flossie Horgan, president of the group 
formed in 1992 with the aim of buying the 1,700-acre wetlands from Koll to save 
it from development and preserve it as a public park. "If you build 5,000 homes 
on the wetlands, you can't save them." 
</P>
<P>
 Amigos de Bolsa Chica, which for 18 years has been fighting to preserve the 
wetlands, is not opposed to all development on the tract but has consistently 
argued for fewer homes and more wetlands restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel very strongly that the most important component is the wetlands," 
Amigos President Chuck Nelson said. "I feel comfortable with the people I'm 
dealing with at Koll, that they're willing to invest the money to do the 
restoration." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Divided on the issue is the Huntington Beach City Council. While some council 
members favor the development, enough remain critical of it to commit the city 
to spending more than $130,000 to hire an independent consultant to review the 
county's environmental impact report and a battery of lawyers to study legal 
challenges to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the way the project is currently structured," said Councilman 
Ralph Bauer, an outspoken critic of the Koll plan. "It looks like it's signed, 
sealed and delivered, and it doesn't represent the viewpoint of the citizens of 
Huntington Beach. There are some alternatives that need to be explored." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the controversy again erupted when council members accused 
the county of trying to stifle discussion about the project by refusing to hold 
public hearings on the impact report and by requiring written comments to be 
submitted by Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Tom Mathews, director of planning for the county's Environmental 
Management Agency, the reasons for not holding hearings were practical. "We are 
required by law to respond to every comment in writing and that would be 
virtually impossible in the kind of environment" created by a public hearing, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that if someone takes the time to sit down with the EIR and is 
moved to comment on it that they will do so in writing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after the report is revised and finalized, Mathews said, the county will 
hold a series of public hearings on the project sometime in May. 
</P>
<P>
 But some city officials charge that the process smacks of elitism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an outrage," said Bauer, who with other council members 
expressed criticism during the City Hall study session. "To not let the 
citizens of Huntington Beach speak out on this issue (is unconscionable). It's 
hard to believe that representative government can function that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed," she said. "This project will impact the citizens of 
Huntington Beach most directly and we felt that the county would be holding 
public hearings." 
</P>
<P>
 To counter what they see as the county's intransigence on the matter, city 
officials said they plan to hold their own public hearing on the impact report 
at 6 p.m. Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Horgan says her 1,797-member group has raised less than $100,000 toward the 
purchase of the Bolsa Chica wetlands since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 She admits that's not much, but if the Koll group could ever be persuaded to 
sell its property, Horgan believes that the funding could be put together 
through some sort of cooperative public venture.

 Once acquired, Horgan said the wetlands could be restored for about $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nature will restore the wetland if allowed to do so in its own time," she 
said, referring to a plan -- criticized by Koll and others -- that would widen 
the connection between the inner and outer Bolsa bays, which Horgan believes 
would allow enough new water in to freshen the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that Koll will have a change of heart," Horgan said. "We've been 
very successful in educating the public and putting out a new vision for Bolsa 
Chica that redefines what community development means." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn from Koll countered: "We're the only ones with a vision and the only ones 
who can pay for it." Proposed Development In exchange for permission to build 
more than 4,000 homes on 400 acres of Bolsa Chica wetlands, the Koll Real 
Estate Group has promised to spend $48 million to restore 1,100 acres of the 
wetlands. The Koll proposal: Conservation: Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve 
Housing: Proposed Bolsa Chica St.

MOTHER SUES OVER TRACTOR DEATH OF SEGERSTROM CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Euna Denee Segerstrom has sued her ex-husband, Theodore, saying he was 
negligent last summer while driving the tractor that crushed their 7-year-old 
daughter to death in the prominent family's lima bean field. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent coincidence, the lawsuit was filed in Orange County Superior 
Court Thursday, within hours of the death of the girl's grandfather, 
farmer-developer Harold T. (Hal) Segerstrom.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's incredible to me. I can't believe that," Werner Escher, a Segerstrom 
family spokesman, said Friday night. "I'm shocked. I don't know anything about 
it. That's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 The wrongful death and negligence lawsuit, which does not seek a specific 
amount of money, names as defendants Theodore W. Segerstrom, 47; C.J. 
Segerstrom & Sons, the family company; and Ruben Alcala, a 76-year-old retired 
farmhand who was riding with Corinne at the ranch the day of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcala, who lives in Fountain Valley, said Friday that he has missed many 
nights' sleep feeling "terrible" about the girl's death.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was just an accident. You know how kids are, when they're young they get 
into mischief. She wanted to get down, and she didn't wait for (the tractor) to 
stop," said Alcala, who worked for the Segerstroms for 47 years. He retired in 
1990 but often returned to the ranch to help out.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was tending to my machine. When I looked around, I noticed that she wasn't 
there and she was tumbling down," he said. "I love the kids. I like all the 
people that work with me, so I take it on my own. . . . For a long time, I 
couldn't sleep. I felt terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, Corinne and her sister, 9-year-old Rayell 
Segerstrom, were at the Santa Ana ranch on MacArthur Boulevard on Aug. 31 
during a visit with their father. 
</P>
<P>
 Rayell rode next to Ted Segerstrom on the tractor, while Corinne sat atop an 
eight-ton bean thrasher near Alcala, who was supervising several other 
farmhands collecting lima beans, the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, Euna Denee Segerstrom contends that her ex-husband, Alcala and 
the company were all negligent in allowing Corinne to ride on farm equipment 
while Ted Segerstrom and Alcala were harvesting beans and supervising workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defendants . . . owed a duty to Plaintiff Euna Denee to supervise and watch 
out for the safety and welfare of her daughter, Corinne and not place her in a 
position of foreseeable danger," the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Segerstrom . . . should have known that allowing (Corinne) to sit atop an 
8-ton bean thrasher would be a dangerous position for a 7-year-old girl. . . . 
Entrusting her care, safety and welfare to (Alcala) who is supervising other 
employees . . . and not able to devote full attention to the safety of 
(Corinne), would be placing (Corinne) in a position to incur great bodily harm 
or death." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also says the company should not have allowed Ted Segerstrom to 
take children out on heavy equipment because he previously has been "afflicted 
with alcoholism, drug abuse, epileptic seizures and on occasions displays 
irrational behavior and judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Family members could not be reached for comment on the lawsuit Friday. The 
Segerstrom family arrived in Orange County in 1898 and at one time was the 
largest independent producer of large lima beans in the United States. As their 
land grew too expensive to farm, the Segerstroms turned to commercial 
development, building South Coast Plaza in 1967 and a string of other retail 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The family also has led the fund-raising campaigns for the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center and South Coast Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Segerstrom, meanwhile, has remained involved in the family's agricultural 
pursuits. Workers at the ranch said at the time of the accident that he often 
drove tractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services for Hal Segerstrom are scheduled for Tuesday at 2 p.m. in St. 
Andrew's Presbyterian Church, 600 St. Andrew's Road, Newport Beach, with burial 
to follow in Fairhaven Memorial Park, 1702 E. Fairhaven Ave., Santa Ana. There 
will be a viewing at Fairhaven from 3 to 8 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of flowers, donations should be made to the burn unit at Shriner's 
Hospital for crippled children, 3160 Geneva St., Los Angeles, Calif. 90020.

2 WOMEN IN HARASSMENT; LAWSUIT SETTLE NEWPORT BEACH: EIGHT OTHER PLAINTIFFS 
FROM THE SCANDAL-ROCKED POLICE DEPARTMENT ARE AWAITING TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two of the 10 women who filed sexual harassment lawsuits against the city, its 
former police chief and a former police captain have settled their cases out of 
court, city officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Peri Ropke, a former dispatcher who accused former Police Chief Arb Campbell 
and Capt. Anthony Villa of raping her after a police party in 1981, will 
receive $113,000. Ropke, who worked at the department for 12 years but has been 
on disability leave since she filed suit in October, 1992, has agreed to 
resign.  
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Miller, Villa's former secretary who joined the department in 1990, 
will receive $62,500 and remain at work. 
</P>
<P>
 The $175,500 will be paid by the city, according to a separate agreement 
reached in June, 1993, between the city, and Campbell and Villa. The city has 
agreed to pay damages resulting from any of the plaintiffs' lawsuits, including 
attorney fees and worker's compensation, unless a jury finds Campbell and Villa 
acted with malice. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, plaintiffs and defendants have agreed not to comment on any 
aspect of the claims.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the official statement released by City Manager Kevin J. Murphy, 
the three defendants -- Campbell, Villa and Sgt. Trent Harris -- do not admit 
liability, but have settled with the two plaintiffs because of the anticipated 
costs of legal defense. For her part, Ropke indicated in the same statement 
that her doctor advised her to settle the lawsuit and put the matter behind 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday evening, Villa said he had nothing to do with the 
settlement negotiations and is preparing for the pending lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has their attorneys and they do their discussion with the 
plaintiffs' attorneys, and I don't have any say. We're being defended by the 
city. If that's what the city decides to do, that's what's done," Villa said. 
"I'm too busy in being involved in further defense of the city to think about 
it one way or the other. I feel like I just need to keep cooperating with the 
city in the defense of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Pingell, an attorney who represents all the plaintiffs in the case, 
refused to comment on the settlement but said none of the eight other 
plaintiffs are involved in settlement negotiations. "These stand on their own," 
he said, insisting that the settlements will not impact the pending lawsuit. 
With Friday's move, the city has now paid about $225,000 to 10 women in 
connection with a sexual harassment scandal that has plagued the department for 
18 months. Eight of those Police Department employees received money in 
exchange for a promise not to join the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are eight plaintiffs from the Police Department in the sexual 
harassment case that is scheduled for trial in October. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1992, four female employees of the Newport Beach Police 
Department filed a lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court alleging that Villa 
inappropriately touched them and made lewd, suggestive comments, and that 
Campbell knowingly tolerated the behavior. Six other women, including Ropke and 
Miller, later joined the lawsuit, which described the Police Department as "a 
hotbed of sexual offensive conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 The officers have denied all wrongdoing, but the scandal brought a shake-up in 
command at the Police Department and many months of low morale.  
</P>
<P>
 Murphy fired Campbell in December, 1992, and three months later fired Villa. 
In June, 1993, the city agreed to reinstate the men so that they could 
immediately retire with benefits in exchange for Campbell's and Villa's 
dropping their wrongful termination suit against the city. And then last 
September, Harris, a 15-year veteran of the department, was named as a 
co-defendant in the suit. Bino Hernandez, an investigator who helped the women 
bring the lawsuit, alleged at that time that Harris "abused his authority," 
made sexually suggestive remarks, discriminated against women and pressured 
female employees to date senior officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's new police chief has tried to move beyond the scandal. But 
for the remaining plaintiffs and the defendants, the courtroom drama is still 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Jane Ruetz, a former records supervisor who was among the original four 
plaintiffs to sue, said she is glad Ropke and Miller were able to settle their 
cases but that she plans to proceed to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't affect us," Ruetz said. "They can do what they wish to do, that's 
up to them. We all have different reasons and different types of things that 
happened to us -- it just depends on what you're willing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruetz said it has been about a year since she has received any settlement 
offers.

ANAHEIM DEFENDS PITCH FOR BIG A QUAKE RELIEF; CONTROVERSY: THE CITY SAYS 
REQUEST FOR FUNDS WAS MADE TO PROTECT ITS ALREADY LIMITED RESOURCES, NOT TO 
MINIMIZE THE TOLL TO OTHER AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Responding to a public backlash, Anaheim City Manager James D. Ruth on Friday 
defended the city's decision to apply for state and federal disaster relief to 
repair earthquake-related damage at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said the application was made to protect the city's already limited funds 
and was not meant to minimize the personal toll suffered by Anaheim's neighbors 
to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very aware of the plight of the citizens of Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties, and it is quite obvious their needs far outweigh ours," Ruth said. 
"It is not our intention to take any money or resources away from those who 
need it most." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Ruth said, the city's "first duty is to protect the interests of 
the citizens of Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's earthquake toppled the 17-ton Sony Jumbotron scoreboard at the 
city-owned stadium, causing severe damage. Preliminary estimates put that 
damage at $3 million to $4 million. The city's stadium insurance has a 
$6.5-million deductible, meaning the city could be liable for those repair 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 For a city that is facing an $8-million budget deficit this year, the damage 
could not have occurred at a worse time. If the city has to pay the repair 
costs out of its general funds, it could potentially mean cuts in library or 
park services or city personnel, some city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Ruth said, "the loss of the Sony Jumbotron and advertising 
panels at Anaheim Stadium could represent a significant loss of advertising 
revenue to the citizens of Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the city's financial predicament, Anaheim officials decided to the 
seek state and federal assistance. County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas 
F. Riley on Wednesday declared the county a disaster area, in part to help make 
Anaheim eligible for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim's pursuit of disaster aid, however, has produced anger among some 
residents in Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm appalled at the audacity of our city leaders," said one resident, 
Virginia Moyle. "To place the scoreboard in the same category as the losses so 
many people suffered in this earthquake is laughable. I think they all need 
replacing -- the scoreboard and the city leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Even several state lawmakers for Orange County suggested the city was 
stretching the purpose of disaster relief and funneling money away from more 
worthy uses. 
</P>
<P>
 "To imagine that the taxpayers of this state would have to pay to put that 
sign back up is outrageous," said Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). 
"If the government can declare a natural disaster and get other people to pay 
for things, why would anyone have insurance on anything? If the city of Anaheim 
didn't have insurance on that sign, then they deserve to have to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) said the request by Anaheim officials 
"just demeans the whole intent of what a disaster area is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy has relatives who lost their house in the San Fernando Valley during 
the temblor, and he argued that a single, isolated problem like a downed 
stadium scoreboard can't begin to compare. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother-in-law and sister-in-law were right there at the epicenter with 
their house smashed to smithereens," Conroy said. "That's a disaster area." 
</P>
<P>
 City spokesman Bret Colson said Anaheim officials have received about a 
half-dozen telephone calls from people who were critical of the city's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 He said city officials "did not expect the type reaction" that they have 
received. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be first in line (for aid), we just want to be in line," 
Colson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the city was also pursuing other means to fund the repairs, 
including possible legal action against the contractor who erected the 
scoreboard and a possible ticket surcharge at stadium events. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Irv Pickler said Anaheim's request will not mean the city will get 
money, while freeways, streets, businesses and homes go unrepaired in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency "is smart enough to make a priority 
list and if they have any money left over, we might get some," Pickler said. 
"If they don't, we won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Supervisor Riley's action applies to the entire county, Anaheim 
Stadium was the only structure in Orange County significantly damaged by the 
quake. County fire officials Friday defended the emergency declaration, saying 
it will help public agencies recover damages that they may not have detected 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the city's claim be approved, federal funds could cover up to 75% of 
repair costs, with the state covering three-fourths of the remaining 25%, 
Colson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, crews on Friday continued to work at the stadium to remove debris 
and erect scaffolding so that braces can be welded in place to stabilize the 
cantilever and remove the Jumbotron for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 And city officials also arranged a tour for 3-year-old Garrett Christensen, 
who feared his beloved California Angels were injured by the collapse of the 
Jumbotron. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, Garrett has been somber and has peppered his mother with 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Were they home asleep? Would they be able to play baseball again?' " said 
his mother, Lori Christensen. "There is something about baseball that he 
intrinsically loves and Anaheim Stadium is his most sacred place." 
</P>
<P>
 The toddler left the stadium happy after being assured of the safety of his 
favorite team. 
</P>

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; WORST MAY COME FOR MOTORISTS ON MONDAY; 
TRAFFIC: RAIN AND MORE NORMAL WORKDAY VOLUME MAY ADD UP TO GREATER CONGESTION. 
RIORDAN IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE CONTINGENCY PLANS TODAY, INCLUDING POSSIBLY 
CONVERTING SOME STREETS TO ONE-WAY THOROUGHFARES.

 As awful as traffic has been since the earthquake, transportation officials 
said Friday that commuters had better brace for congestion to get worse next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The crippled freeways and jammed side streets will be filled with more people 
returning to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people did not attempt to get to work after the earthquake," said Frank 
White, chief of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
"But on Monday -- we are all afraid of what we will face." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to ease what could be monumental traffic jams, Mayor Richard 
Riordan intends to announce a plan today to relieve congestion on city streets. 
Riordan is considering converting some east-west streets, such as Pico and 
Olympic boulevards, into one-way thoroughfares, Deputy Mayor Rae James said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, transportation officials are preparing for a worst-case scenario: 
rain along with the typical workday volume of commuters on the region's freeway 
network, which suffered damage on six roadways -- including the Golden State, 
Antelope Valley and Simi Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternate routes along surface streets can handle only 60% of the traffic 
diverted from broken freeways, said Robert R. Yates, general manager of the Los 
Angeles Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not drive alone, Yates and others urged. Take public transit or car-pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The key choke points, transportation officials say, are at the downed portion 
of the Santa Monica Freeway -- usually traversed by about 340,000 motorists 
daily -- and the main arteries into the Santa Clarita Valley, which typically 
carried more than 200,000 vehicles daily. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days since the 6.6-magnitude earthquake, transportation officials have 
struggled to increase options for beleaguered commuters. Workers have scurried 
to clear the debris from freeways, removing nearly 5,000 yards of concrete and 
steel rubble from the collapsed Interstate 5 and Antelope Valley Freeway. 
Engineers frantically analyzed detour routes. Transit planners mapped out new 
stations for commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Monday, the Santa Clarita Metrolink commuter train will extend its 
route 50 miles, using freight tracks, to include station stops in Palmdale and 
Lancaster. A station at Vincent on that route will open Jan. 31. A fourth 
station, in Canyon Country at Via Princessa, is expected to open Feb. 7. For 
the rest of the month, Metrolink officials say they will honor Antelope Valley 
Transit passes and tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 White said the agency also plans to open another new route, with stations in 
Northridge and Camarillo in February. Sites for those two stations have not 
been selected. Some of the new stations are expected to be rudimentary, with 
gravel lots for parking and a wooden platform. "But I am quite sure commuters 
will be pleased with even that," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the flow of motorists from north county communities, Caltrans has 
worked to shorten detours along the Golden State Freeway. Jerry Baxter, head of 
the Caltrans district office, said crews hoped to open an alternate route 
Tuesday that would utilize The Old Road near Weldon Canyon Road to Calgrove 
Boulevard in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 This route would allow two lanes of traffic in each direction, Baxter said. In 
the days ahead, officials will decide whether to convert the newly opened lanes 
on the Golden State to car-pool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 With inspection reports arriving continually, Caltrans officials said the 
status of roads can quickly change. On Friday afternoon, officials closed 
connectors between the westbound Ventura Freeway to the southbound and 
northbound Glendale Freeway. They also shut the connector between the eastbound 
Ventura to the southbound Glendale Freeway. The interchange is expected to 
remain closed for two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime we have to close something else, it's not good news," said Caltrans 
spokesman Russ Snyder, who added that it was not known whether those newly 
closed interchanges, which need shoring up, were damaged in Monday's quake or 
the aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 To help Westside commuters who use the Santa Monica Freeway, the MTA has 
started a new bus line and will deploy 20 additional buses to five routes: 
Lines 2, 4, 20-320, 439 and 454. The new Westside Special bus, which started 
service Thursday, begins at the westernmost part of its route, at Pacific Coast 
Highway and Temescal Canyon Road near Will Rogers State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles officials tried to fix traffic lights, which have 
impeded traffic flow, predominantly on the Westside. Most of the 6,400 miles of 
city streets were virtually untouched by the earthquake, except in areas along 
the Santa Monica Freeway where debris showered down upon thoroughfares. But 38 
traffic signals -- including 26 that were affected by the downed Santa Monica 
Freeway -- have stopped working. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks ahead, officials said they will evaluate other proposals -- such 
as establishing a dedicated busway along the old trolley right of way on 
Exposition Boulevard. They said they also will consider giving preferential 
treatment to high-occupancy vehicles on selected streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan is expected to direct city personnel to work staggered hours, having 
them use headquarters close to their homes. Some workers living in the San 
Fernando Valley would work in Van Nuys City Hall. Others will work from home 
using their telephones or computers, James said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding industry, the mayor is expected to urge large employers to set up 
staggered work hours and to have shuttle buses bring employees to mass transit 
stations. Riordan cannot order employers to carry out such practices, but 
private employers have been cooperative in conversations, James said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also is expected to announce dedicated lanes for trucks. Much of the 
mayor's strategy is based on techniques used during the 1984 Olympics.

 As I look back on it, maybe I should have listened to Quirky Quake. 
</P>
<P>
 When that six-point-sixer shook L.A. like a baby on a water bed, all I could 
think of doing was running and screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 If I were as cool and sensible as Quirky Quake advised, I would have ducked 
under a heavy oak desk and waited for the shaking to subside. Then I would have 
walked calmly to my disaster supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Quirky is a cartoon logo of the Southern California Earthquake Preparedness 
Project. He frowns at panic. His instructions are clear: Seek shelter. Stay 
calm. 
</P>
<P>
 I stumbled down the stairs from our bedroom shouting incoherently for 
flashlight batteries, cursing Lucy Jones and thinking I would rather die than 
survive by drinking water from a toilet tank. 
</P>
<P>
 I am never at my best at 4:31 a.m. on a Monday morning when my house is 
whipping around like a twig in the wind. Only the calming presence of my wife, 
Cinelli, kept me from going completely to hell. 
</P>
<P>
 "One step at a time," she kept saying as we picked our way through fallen 
debris in total darkness, "one step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, I thought I was in a parade. That's what hysteria can do to you. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Good morning. I am back from special assignment just in time to offer 
perspective on what Caltech seismologists are calling the Medium One. Lucy 
Jones is one of the seismologists. We see her on TV. Whenever the earth 
trembles, Lucy is there, like sunrise over the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't mean to make light of a situation that has cost lives and destroyed 
property. This is not a good time in Happy City. But I keep thinking about 
Quirky Quake. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a cool dude in sunglasses and sneakers who for years has been trying to 
get us prepared for earthquakes. I scoffed at everything he stood for. I should 
have listened. But do we ever? 
</P>
<P>
 Quirky, for instance, insists that we know where our emergency equipment is in 
the event of disaster. Normally, I can't find my shoes in the dark, much less a 
crowbar or a camp stove. 
</P>
<P>
 But I've learned my lesson. Now I have a flashlight within easy reach, right 
next to the vodka and dry vermouth in crash-proof containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Our house still stands, by the way. We have survived floods, firestorms and 
earthquakes. "And every night," Cinelli says, "I scan the skies for incoming 
comets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I should have known the earthquake was coming. The night before, the Purple 
Hand of God swayed slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the detached hand from a mannequin. I found it in the garment district. 
The hand hangs on a thin wire over my word processor. One finger points 
downward. Cinelli says it is God's hand, reminding me to write. 
</P>
<P>
 It swayed Sunday night. It was reacting to a foreshock, the way cockroaches in 
China flee for their lives when a shaker is coming. I should have heeded the 
warning of the Purple Hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs are supposed to disappear in advance of earthquakes and return when it's 
safe. Seismologists are said to salivate slightly. We do not have a 
seismologist around the house, but we do have a dog. I found him under a table. 
He may be smarter than I think. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also said that birds in cages peck each other to death just before a 
shaker hits, but we only have one bird. He had no one to peck. 
</P>
<P>
 Do we ever heed warnings? Sometimes, I guess. But mostly the survival instinct 
drives us forward down the eternities, firm in the knowledge that whatever 
monster crawls through the city won't get us. 
</P>
<P>
 That works most of the time. When it doesn't we cling together like children 
in the dark, and wait for the morning. It comes. Always. And we pick up the 
pieces and start all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The airwaves were filled with inspirational messages just after the six-sixer. 
Bill Clinton flew west, Pete Wilson flew south and Mayor Dick tried to 
articulate his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 What impressed most was acknowledgment from Archbishop Roger Mahony, the Pope 
of L.A., that the Vatican cared. A special prayer was said, but we still had 
aftershocks. Thank the Pope but boil the water. 
</P>
<P>
 I went down to the epicenter. A small citrus orchard stood intact, but lemons 
were scattered all over the ground. Hundreds of them, gleaming in a strange 
amber sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Years from now when I think of the Quake of '94, I'll think of them. And of 
the Purple Hand of God, swaying slightly overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll be all right. Light a candle and keep an eye out for comets.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; BARRINGTON BUILDING WILL BE DEMOLISHED; 
AFTERMATH: STRUCTURE THAT HOUSED DOCTORS TO THE STARS IS DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR. 
MOST TENANTS WILL LOSE THEIR BELONGINGS AND PATIENTS' RECORDS. 
</P>

<P>
 For more than 30 years, the Barrington Building in the 11600 block of West 
Olympic Boulevard had been a great place to spot celebrities. Edward G. 
Robinson, Mama Cass and Steve McQueen used to stop by. More recently, Drew 
Barrymore, Linda Evans and Madonna reportedly made appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: Many of Los Angeles' top-flight dentists were housed in the 
six-story building. And some of the city's most prominent psychiatrists and 
psychologists, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the mental health center of L.A.," said Kay Veach, 70, whose first-floor 
coffee shop had kept locals fed on biscuits, gravy and other "home cooking" 
since 1967. "And now, they're tearing it down." 
</P>
<P>
 The metal and glass building buckled badly in Monday's earthquake and has been 
leaning precariously to the south. All week, the area around it has been roped 
off, snarling traffic on Olympic. Right after the quake, a few fast-moving 
tenants entered through an unlocked back door and rescued important 
possessions. But the majority were unable to retrieve patients' phone numbers 
or medical records. A demolition contract was issued late Friday at the city's 
demand, virtually ensuring that everything inside will be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 As the end neared, many tenants -- some of them angry that the city was not 
giving them one last chance to salvage their belongings -- were still trying to 
grasp the idea that their beloved building was coming down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like losing a family. It really is," said Marshall S. Cherkas, a 
psychoanalyst and forensic psychiatrist who worked in the Barrington for 26 
years. Cherkas said the building had been built by a group of psychoanalysts, 
and stood as a "tour de force of mental health" with a special camaraderie.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now everyone is spreading to the winds and it's very sad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wanted to be in the Barrington Building. It had sort of a 
reputation," said Sharon Bloom, a psychotherapist who had practiced there since 
1987. This was a building, she said, where you never got locked out of your 
office -- because Veach kept emergency keys in her coffee shop. Other office 
buildings were anonymous. This one was warm -- its residents seemed to make it 
a point to get to know one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's because they're in the helping professions," said Bloom, "but 
(Barrington tenants) are very friendly, open people." Her third-floor office 
was among the worst hit. "Somebody told me you have to crawl on your belly to 
that particular floor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everyone else, Bloom worried most over the loss of her patients' records. 
But there were other things as well. "I've had my therapy chairs for 20 years," 
she said sadly. "My son is now 30, but I had an arts and crafts thing he had 
done when he was 7 or 8 on my bulletin board. I liked it." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Crane, the president of Crane Realty Services, which manages the 
building, said he was told on Thursday that the building would have to come 
down. The Barrington, said an official communique from the city, posed a 
"present, imminent, extreme and immediate hazard or danger to life and limb, 
health and safety." 
</P>
<P>
 When Friday's aftershocks shook the building again, sending more glass flying 
from its south face, officials became determined to level the building as soon 
as possible. At midday, city workers set about disconnecting power lines that 
might be in the path of flying debris. Then, just before nightfall, the 
Department of Public Works issued the demolition contract. Gerald Takaki, chief 
of the bureau of community safety, said the wrecking ball would start its work 
no later than Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fears about the impending destruction brought some tenants to the police lines 
to plead for permission to re-enter the building. Just 10 minutes, they told 
the National Guard troops who kept them at bay -- that's all they'd need. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy said he had a research paper in there that he'd been working on for 
10 years," said one of the Guardsmen, recalling one of the sadder stories he 
had heard that day. He understood why people were sad about their losses, he 
said, but for his part, he was trying to stay as far from the building as 
possible. "If you ask me, I don't want to be anywhere near it." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the building attracted a constant stream of visitors, many who had 
seen it on television. Larry Benjamin, an Internal Revenue Service agent who 
worked down the street in the City National Bank building, was one of them, and 
he offered a morbid suggestion. "They ought to get someone from Death Row to go 
through the building and save the records," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Thaxton drove over from her badly shaken home, she said, because this 
was where she had her teeth cleaned. "My dental office is in there -- where I 
get tortured," she said wryly. "I just wanted to watch the building go down so 
I know I'll never have to go back." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Reynoso was shooting videotape to take home to his 73-year-old 
grandmother, he said. "I used to bring her here to see her doctor," he said. 
"Man, it looks bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Sutherland stood nearby. She had worked as a waitress at Veach's 
eatery, called Marshall's Coffee Shop, for seven years. Her last paycheck was 
still in the cash register inside. It had been a fun job, she said. Because of 
its location at the front of the building (not to mention Veach's long-standing 
reputation as the Barrington's mother hen), the coffee shop served as gossip 
central. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the big film stars went in there," Sutherland said, nodding toward the 
building. "You could write a book! That was a very unique coffee shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Cherkas and others confirmed that many of the building's visitors were 
high-profile. "I personally did not see a lot of celebrities. But I have 
several colleagues who see major rock stars, movie stars, athletes, TV stars," 
he said. Sometimes, he added with a chuckle, that led to some confusion.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was riding up the elevator one day and two teen-age girls started staring 
at me," he recalled. "Finally, one walked over and said, 'You're Danny Kaye 
aren't you?' "

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; MANY TURN TO VENTURA COUNTY FOR A SAFE HAVEN; 
RELOCATIONS: REALTY OFFICES ARE FLOODED BY CALLS FROM VALLEY RESIDENTS AND 
BUSINESS OWNERS FOLLOWING MONDAY'S TEMBLOR. 
</P>

<P>
 San Fernando Valley residents and business owners are flooding Ventura County 
realty offices and apartment complexes, looking for safe places to live or do 
business in the wake of Monday's devastating earthquake, real estate agents 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been phenomenal," said Kelli Tardif-Arriola, administrative manager 
for the Westlake office of Bob Ely Realty, where agents have fielded 75 calls 
for residential rental properties since Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half of those calls, Tardif-Arriola said, were from Valley residents 
anxious to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are like Shelley Maine, 29, and her fiancee, Ted Osier, 30, Northridge 
apartment dwellers who have often considered leaving the North Valley, an area 
they describe as crime-ridden and graffiti-plagued. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the earthquake we said, 'Yes, definitely, that's it,' " said Maine, who 
works as a lab technician in Calabasas. On Friday, the couple looked at 
apartments in Thousand Oaks and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the rents are higher in Ventura County, particularly in Thousand 
Oaks, the couple said it was worth the extra $200 a month to live in a building 
that is seismically sound and in a neighborhood where they could feel safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want a little peace and quiet," Osier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial real estate agents also report a booming rental market for office 
and manufacturing space. Like residential agents, they say the bulk of the 
interest is concentrated in Westlake, Thousand Oaks and Newbury Park, with a 
few renters looking as far east as Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have beepers and car phones, and they are all beeping and ringing off 
the hook right now," said Jack Dwyer, a realtor with Brown-Realtors' Westlake 
commercial division in Thousand Oaks. Dwyer said he received 10 such calls in a 
24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think in 30 to 60 days, we'll have very little vacancy in the area," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial brokers say the calls range from manufacturers requesting as much 
as 120,000 square feet of manufacturing plant space, to doctors and lawyers 
looking for 1,500-square-foot offices to hang their shingles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking out one company this afternoon to look at 100,000 square feet of 
manufacturing space in Camarillo," Grubb & Ellis broker Rick Heath said. "Their 
building in the Valley was condemned." 
</P>
<P>
 The old City Hall on Hillcrest Drive in Thousand Oaks -- virtually untouched 
by the earthquake -- has caught the interest of at least three quake-rattled 
Valley companies looking to relocate to more solid ground, City Manager Grant 
Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brimhall said the unnamed companies have asked about moving into the building, 
situated atop a rocky hillside overlooking The Oaks mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly flush with new clients, brokers said they are reluctant to release 
the business owners' names for fear other brokers will read the list and start 
wooing their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one big deal, however, has been made public already -- in Los Angeles 
County, just down the street from the Ventura County line. Computer giant 
Packard Bell leased 160,000 square feet of space after its Chatsworth 
headquarters received severe earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell executives have spent months looking for a suitable new site for 
its operations, but the quake put those plans on hold, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting next week, Packard Bell will open its headquarters and some 
production facilities at a vacant site in Westlake Village that the company had 
previously considered in its search. On Tuesday, Packard Bell officials said, 
it seemed like a good choice, at least temporarily. They are making plans to 
stay for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was very convenient to us . . . because it doesn't really change our 
operations in any major way," said Mal Ransom, Packard Bell's vice president of 
marketing. "We just moved down the (Ventura Freeway) a bit."  
</P>
<P>
 Realtors hope other businesses and residents will follow. But they say it is 
too early to tell what, if any, effect all the inquiries and rental showings 
will have on the county's real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's more smoke than fire right now," said George Hutchison, an agent 
with Brown-Realty's residential division in Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, he said, some callers might be reacting to an initial fright 
that will die down as the quake's aftershocks level off. Conversely, others 
might not have had time to call an agent and start looking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think many people (in the Valley) with damaged homes are still standing in 
lines at the FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) centers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the many looking for houses and apartments spared by the tremors, some seem 
to have set their sights on Simi Valley, though parts of the city incurred 
quake damage as severe as in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people are looking for something safe, and the news didn't play up . . . 
Simi Valley as that badly damaged," said Mary Ferris, an agent at Valley Homes 
Realtors in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferris said she received 30 calls in one day alone, many of them from Valley 
residents interested in two rentals she had advertised in the paper. 
Ironically, both residences were severely damaged in the earthquake and are in 
no condition to be rented out, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 West of Sycamore Drive, however, many rental properties are still standing, 
largely unaffected by the quake, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You put an ad in the paper today, 100 people will call," she predicted.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; TIRING RUN THROUGH FEMA MAZE; AFTERMATH: SIMI 
VALLEY WOMAN, SEEKING AID TO REPAIR HER DAMAGED MOBILE HOME, IS TAKEN ABACK BY 
FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fran Kolodziej is not impressed with the federal government. The 65-year-old 
Simi Valley woman spent Friday morning trying to line up federal assistance to 
repair her quake-damaged mobile home. An hour and 10 minutes later, she walked 
away overwhelmed with paperwork and confused as to when she might receive an 
emergency rent voucher or if officials would even process her application for a 
grant to fix her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geez, I don't believe this," Kolodziej said after her first experience with 
federal relief officials. "I think it should have been handled a lot 
differently." 
</P>
<P>
 In the time that Kolodziej was at the disaster relief office, she answered 
more than 60 questions from seven government officials, filled out one long 
application form for financial aid, and was given another form to apply for 
rent money. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also bounced between different stations in the office, with emergency 
relief officials giving conflicting directions. Kolodziej said she was not 
expecting immediate relief, but was taken aback at the bureaucratic maze she 
would have to maneuver before she could receive any emergency rent voucher or 
monetary aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "My house is uninhabitable," Kolodziej said. "I've been staying with my son, 
but it's awkward. They have their own lives, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Kolodziej's encounter with the Federal Emergency Management Agency began about 
10:20 a.m., when she entered the Simi Valley center and was signed in by a 
worker who then directed Kolodziej to wait in a chair. 
</P>
<P>
 After about five minutes, the retired medical records keeper was led to a 
table where FEMA worker Frances Magee began asking questions and handwriting 
the responses on a one-page form. The initial interview was designed so FEMA 
officials can direct disaster victims to the services they need, Magee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is your home destroyed?" Magee asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, pretty much," Kolodziej said. "It's not livable." 
</P>
<P>
 Kolodziej then offered a detailed description of her wrecked house at Crest 
Mobile Home Park in eastern Simi Valley. The quake knocked the house off its 
supports, and metal jacks now protrude through her kitchen floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the metal skirt surrounding the foundation was torn away during 
Monday's violent shaking, she said. The porch was left tilted and the gas 
heater was thrown three feet from the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Magee finished her interview about 20 minutes later, she had Kolodziej 
wait for a few minutes while her supervisor approved her application. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should really have computers here to make the process faster," Kolodziej 
said while she waited. "This is really time-consuming. I'm sure all these 
people here have lots of things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 When Magee returned, she directed Kolodziej to two tables, one for loans and 
the other for emergency rent vouchers. Magee told Kolodziej she could wait in 
either of the lines leading up to the tables -- no particular order was 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolodziej went to the loan line first, but there were two people ahead of her. 
So she decided to try the line for the emergency rent vouchers instead. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief wait, a counselor at the rent voucher table told Kolodziej that 
she must come to her table last, and directed Kolodziej to wait in line for the 
federal officials handling loans. 
</P>
<P>
 When she returned to the loan table, Kolodziej received a blank loan 
application and was sent to meet with a loan specialist at another table. 
</P>
<P>
 When loan specialist Donald Homer looked at Kolodziej's paperwork, he told her 
she shouldn't be seeing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really afford another loan payment," Homer told her. "They should 
have sent you directly to the grant program." 
</P>
<P>
 Homer said FEMA workers should have noticed that Kolodziej's $623 monthly 
income is too low to qualify for a loan program administered by the Small 
Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kolodziej waited for Homer to double-check with FEMA workers, she sighed. 
"Well, I could have gone through something I didn't have to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolodziej was then sent to the grant table, where Emil Witzens instructed her 
about the qualifications and limitations of the federal grant program. 
</P>
<P>
 He told Kolodziej that in a few weeks she would be contacted by an inspector 
who would assess the damage to her mobile home. Then it would be determined 
whether she qualifies for a grant. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, Witzens said, Kolodziej must complete her loan application and be 
denied before she is eligible for a grant. Grants of up to $12,000 are provided 
only to low-income households, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolodziej then checked with loan officials, who said she does not have to fill 
out a loan application in order to qualify for a grant. Supervisory Loan 
Officer Charles Sampson said Kolodziej's income is below the minimum amount 
necessary for a loan and took away her blank loan application. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kolodziej was reassured that her grant application would be processed, 
she headed for the disaster housing table. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There, she received the most disappointing news of the day. Only after her 
mobile home is inspected and only after her application is approved by FEMA 
officials, will Kolodziej be eligible for an emergency rent voucher. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be as fast as two weeks, or it could take months, housing counselor 
Bonnie Warrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Kolodziej is approved for emergency rent voucher, she must find an 
apartment by herself and find a landlord willing to accept the government's 
18-month voucher for payment, Warrington said. A list of possible landlords 
will be made available, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kolodziej finds an apartment, she must also wait for federal officials 
to inspect it, Warrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a slight daze, Kolodziej shook her head, took a housing application and 
then left the disaster relief office about 70 minutes after she entered. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is quite a stress on me," Kolodziej said. "I thought it was their duty 
to provide something faster than this." How to Help

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FRUSTRATED FILLMORE PONDERS REBUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 City leaders and merchants in Fillmore expressed growing frustration Friday as 
they searched for the best way to go about rebuilding the devastated farm 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The job of rebuilding will take much longer than initially predicted, city 
officials said. It will be complicated by worries about possible lawsuits and 
fears that local businesses might not be able to afford to start over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to avoid future litigation by downtown merchants with buildings damaged 
in Monday's quake, the Fillmore City Council on Thursday adopted a detailed 
appeal process for any building the council decides ultimately to condemn. 
</P>
<P>
 The council spent more than an hour in a closed executive session with City 
Atty. Roger Meyers before adopting the complex appeal process -- discussing the 
legal pitfalls of condemning any buildings on the downtown strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers warned the council not to act hastily, citing mistakes made by the town 
of Coalinga after city officials there decided to raze most of their 
earthquake-damaged downtown in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalinga later was hit with a series of lawsuits from business people who said 
Coalinga officials acted prematurely and destroyed the character of the town by 
demolishing its downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our vision for Fillmore has always been to preserve the historic look of 
downtown," said City Manager Roy Payne, who also urged a cautious approach to 
reconstruction. "That's not going to change." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's policy of moving slowly, however, actually brought criticisms 
Friday from some business owners who complained that they are being blocked 
from demolishing their buildings as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Masons Assn., which owns the historic Masonic Temple on Central 
Avenue, were among the chief critics of any delays in demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to come down," said Jack Starnes, a member of the association. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ken Glenn, president of the Masons Assn., said the group doesn't have the 
money needed for a new building even if the old one is demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to come down and the lot will probably remain vacant, or we'll try 
to sell it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost will be a big problem for many other small businesses in the city, 
officials agreed. That view was supported by a city consultant who told the 
council Thursday that the new codes could be prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to adopt a code that is going to be more expensive than anyone 
realizes, making it impossible for these businesses to rebuild," said architect 
Steve Craig of The Planning Corp. in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on my experience, not much is going to happen for a while. Look at 
Santa Cruz and Watsonville and you'll see it's going to take a long time to 
rebuild," Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Payne took issue with Craig's predictions that reconstruction 
efforts might be too slow in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "How quickly we can recover has as much to do with the will and desire of the 
people here than anything else," he said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; JOBLESS CLAIMS DOUBLE AT SIMI OFFICE; IMPACT: 
MANY APPLICANTS ARE COMMUTERS LAID OFF BY SAN FERNANDO VALLEY BUSINESSES THAT 
WERE BADLY DAMAGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jobless claims doubled this week at the state unemployment office in Simi 
Valley as earthquake-damaged businesses began laying off employees, officials 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Tuesday, about 500 eastern Ventura County residents who are out of work 
because of the quake filed claims at the state Employment Development 
Department's office in Simi Valley, bringing total applications this week to 
about 800, twice the usual number. 
</P>
<P>
 The state jobless office in Ventura reported 50 to 100 quake-related 
applications this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Kennedy, manager of the Simi Valley unemployment office, said the number 
of applications was highest on Friday, perhaps because people spent the first 
part of the week cleaning up after the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first two or three days they were putting their houses together," Kennedy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cleanup job wasn't over for many Simi Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Trash cans and dumpsters overflowing with building debris, broken glassware 
and other quake-ruined items lined streets in eastern Simi Valley and parts of 
Thousand Oaks as residents continued to sort through the mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, garbage haulers have been carrying 200 more tons of trash per 
day than usual from the east county to the Simi Valley Landfill, a 10% 
increase, said Doug Corcoran, vice president of the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Corcoran said he expects even more garbage once contractors begin tearing up 
damaged walls, roofs and floors to begin repairs. "Once they start getting into 
the real structural demolition, it's going to pick up a lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, resident Jerry Roth said he paid for a 31-foot-long dumpster 
to be brought into his Chanteclair Estates gated community so neighbors could 
clear out broken glass and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was filled in a day and we had to call in for a second one," Roth said. "I 
think people, from the minute the quake was over, were thinking about cleaning 
up and putting this behind them." 
</P>
<P>
 In their struggle to bring their lives back to normal, Thousand Oaks and Simi 
Valley residents were also seeking assurance that their homes were safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials said the backlog of inspection requests rose to more 
than 3,000 on Friday, with most coming from homeowners and apartment dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most apartments and houses inspected so far have been declared safe 
to enter and occupy, residents of others have not been so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 All 13 of the two-story stucco homes on Golf Meadows Court in northeast Simi 
Valley have been tagged with yellow signs, warning residents that they may 
enter the buildings but should not live in them until the houses are repaired. 
The street was bustling with activity Friday as residents scurried to move out 
belongings before the start of rains forecast for this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us we're not to live in the home," said Elizabeth Fuentes as she 
and her husband and their two sons packed up belongings to move to her mother's 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to interior walls that had broken away from the floor and were 
leaning to one side, Fuentes and her husband said they don't know how they will 
pay their $2,000 monthly mortgage payments and save money for the repairs 
necessary to move back in. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple estimate it will cost $50,000 to fix the house, but they have no 
earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the disaster, the Fuentes family and other homeowners along the 
street had sued their tract's builder, alleging shoddy construction, residents 
said. And unless the Fuentes family gets a settlement from that suit, their 
only hope for rebuilding is federal aid, Elizabeth's husband, Javier Fuentes, 
said. "Without that we'll probably have to foreclose." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Residents laid off as a result of the quake were also worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Yanez commutes from Simi Valley to Rocketdyne in Canoga Park, where he 
has worked for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of earthquake damage to the business, Yanez is not sure when he will 
be able to go back to work. "They tell us maybe Monday," the 34-year-old 
jet-propulsion technician said. "It could be two weeks, it could be three 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he added, "as far as we know we're not getting paid." 
</P>
<P>
 So Yanez brought his wife, laid off before the quake from her job at a 
photography studio, and their infant son to the state jobless office Friday, 
where they ran into at least three other Rocketdyne workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yanez said he was frustrated to learn that his weekly benefit payments may be 
as low as $200. "That's not going to cover it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the newly jobless are commuters who work for San Fernando 
Valley businesses seriously damaged by the quake, others are employed by Simi 
Valley companies closed for earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those laying off workers is one of Simi Valley's largest employers, 
defense contractor Whittaker Electronic Systems, which has furloughed about 675 
of its 750 workers until early spring. The company expects to complete repairs 
at its structurally damaged plant by the end of March, Whittaker officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To alleviate financial hardship, the city of Simi Valley plans to waive all 
planning fees for quake-related repairs to homes and businesses, Assistant City 
Manager Mike Sedell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks officials are also considering waiving fees for minor repairs 
related to the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County residents should not expect any state help with quake 
repairs, elected officials warned Friday. While touring Simi Valley High School 
on Friday, state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) told school officials that 
the state simply can't afford to help pay for repairs at the heavily damaged 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials estimated damage to the school at $3 million to $5 million, 
but they have no earthquake insurance to help cover these costs.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; PROJECT TO COMBINE OLD, NEW HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An affordable-housing and historic preservation project that includes 
construction of three condominiums and the relocation of a 66-year-old home, 
known as the Practice House among Brea residents, has been approved by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council this week voted 3 to 1 in favor of the project. Mayor Glenn G. 
Parker and council members Bev Perry and Burnie Dunlap voted for the project, 
while council member Kathryn E. Wiser dissented and council member Carrey J. 
Nelson abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redevelopment Agency will provide $101,000 to help subsidize mortgages for 
low-income buyers to purchase the project's four homes from the developers, 
William Kimble and George B. Taunton. The homes will continue to be offered for 
low-income housing for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker called the project an investment in a blighted part of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Taunton, who bought two parcels of land on Laurel Avenue for $41,000 from the 
city, said construction of the condominiums and rehabilitation of the Practice 
House on that land will begin next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Practice House was built in 1927 on the Brea Olinda High School campus and 
used by the home economics department to teach students how to cook, clean and 
make household repairs. It was moved out of the high school in 1989 when the 
school was rebuilt and stored on blocks at several vacant lots over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The restored building and the new condominiums are expected to be complete 
within eight months, Taunton said. He then will sell the homes to low-income 
families, who will get help from the city to pay for the properties at market 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will limit occupancy to five residents per home. Each home has 
two bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said families of more than five can ask the City Council for an 
exception to the rule to be granted at the council's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiser questioned the cost of the project. "I don't understand why the city has 
to spend so much money and the developer reaps the profits," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it's an expensive project," Redevelopment Services Director Susan M. 
Georgino said. "We're not saying it's the most economic." 
</P>
<P>
 Other city officials said the project is necessary to provide affordable 
housing and preserve a historical site. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; MAYOR SAYS SCULPTURE IS FOR EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Union Passage," a larger-than-life sculpture of a man and women clasping arms 
and lending one another strength and support, was dedicated this week in a 
quiet, grass-covered corner of the Civic Center between two tall pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 1/2-foot-high bronze sculpture by Guy Angelo Wilson is the second 
statue to be erected in the city's Arts in Public Places program.It cost 
$59,000 and was financed by developer fees and took about 2 1/2 years to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, 35, a Los Angeles-based artist who lives in Diamond Bar, also created 
the wooden statue of "The Laguna Greeter" in Laguna Beach. He said his latest 
work is a tribute to the richness of diversity and the strength that can be 
attained by "connecting" and overcoming differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Frank Kessler told a gathering of more than 100 that he sees the 
sculpture as "a visible object" in the effort to make Garden Grove a better 
place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "Union Passage" is a sculpture for everyone in the city, Kessler said. "It 
represents Garden Grove's strong community spirit and our willingness to help 
others and support our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bruce A. Broadwater said Wilson did "a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 "This will offer a nice place to sit and meditate and get rid of your 
problems. We ought to do more arts in public places," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evie Schild, a city resident of 33 years who attended the brief ceremony, 
called the sculpture "a great addition to the city. I think it's wonderful. I 
look at it and it means strength, strength between a man and woman." 
</P>
<P>
 The sculpture is located near the corner of Acacia Parkway and Euclid 
Street.ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; INTEREST DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT PASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Board members of the Tustin Community Foundation must disclose their financial 
interests within the city as required by the city's conflict-of-interest codes, 
the City Council decided this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit foundation was created last year to help raise money for youth, 
recreational and cultural programs of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member board of directors includes Councilmen Charles E. Puckett and 
Jeffrey Thomas. The board directors are Cheryl Bell, James Farley, Terry 
Riggins, Richard Scherr and Margarete Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy City Clerk Valerie Whitman said that every year, the city 
routinely adds or eliminates positions that require financial interest 
disclosure. Employees in the list are also required to file the statements upon 
assuming and leaving their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment program manager was added to the list, while the job of 
director of community administrative services, which was eliminated, was 
deleted from the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Managerial positions in the community services, community development, 
engineering and public works, finance, legislation, personnel, police and water 
departments are also required to disclose financial interests in the city and 
within two miles of the city, Whitman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial interests include real estate properties, rental income, "anything 
that could possibly pose a conflict of interest," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a case-by-case basis, consultants working for the city are also required to 
disclose financial interests, Whitman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, the city manager, financial directors and planning 
commissioners are also required by state laws to disclose financial interests.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; DISEASE DOESN'T STOP CITIZEN OF THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Driving the 275 miles to Las Vegas alone may not seem like a big deal to most 
people. But to Linda Graf, on her way to a service club convention in June, it 
could have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf has been left without use of her legs as a result of a 21-year struggle 
with multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
 But a woman who has survived breast cancer and the untimely death of her 
husband, and fights a moment-to-moment battle with the degenerative disease, 
wasn't about to let a strip of roadway rob her of her independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to prove I could do it," said Graf, who operates a specially 
equipped van with hand controls. "And I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf's efforts to triumph over adversity have proven beneficial to her 
community, as well as a source of inspiration. The former elementary school 
teacher regularly donates 30 hours a week to helping out as many as five church 
and service organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 For her volunteer efforts, Graf was recognized at a city luncheon Friday as 
the 1993 Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really quite an honor, and it was quite a surprise," said the 
56-year-old Orange resident. "I'm just trying to enjoy it. Maybe that's wrong, 
but I am." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a fabulous individual," said Helen Walker, part of the chamber's 
Citizen of the Year selection committee. "She's a gal that has had a lot of 
valleys in her life. The wheelchair does not seem to have stopped her from 
being gung-ho about helping other people. She's really an inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her setbacks, Graf has devoted most of her adult life to helping 
others. She is active in the Women's Club of Orange, the Kiwanis Club and the 
Presbyterian Church of Orange, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The multiple sclerosis is an inconvenience," Graf said. "But it's never 
stopped me. It slows me up sometimes. But if I can do it physically, if I have 
the knowledge, I will do it." 
</P>
<P>
 "From the waist up, I'm fine," she added. "But from the waist down, I'm just 
losing strength piece by piece. But I guess that's just part it." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf said one of her most satisfying experiences came as a volunteer for 
Lifeline at St. Joseph's Hospital during the 1980s. The program helps monitor 
infirm and elderly residents and dispatches paramedics in case of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf's latest honor is not her first. She was selected Kiwanian of the Year by 
the Kiwanis Club of Orange Suburbia, just two years after being the first woman 
to join the all-men's group in 1987. She has also served as president of the 
Women's Club of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the van she drove to Las Vegas represents another award of sorts: The 
vehicle was given to her by the Kiwanis Club last year and has since become an 
essential part of her active life. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what keeps me going," a teary-eyed Graf said of the sentiment behind 
the gift. "It just keeps me going." MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; PUBLIC HOMELESS TO RECEIVE WARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeless people living in the Civic Center have at least two more days to move 
out of the area before police officers begin ticketing them under the city's 
new anti-camping ordinance, Santa Ana police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which went into effect Friday, bars anyone from using the Civic 
Center for "living accommodations," such as sleeping or cooking, but does allow 
"short-term, casual" dozing. 
</P>
<P>
 Civic Center patrol officers "will walk around the Civic Center itself with 
notices that show the boundaries (of the ordinance) and admonish people of what 
the ordinance is about" today, Sunday and possibly Monday, Santa Ana Police Lt. 
Robert Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later next week, police will begin citing transients violating the ordinance 
in the area bounded by Sycamore and Shelton streets, Santa Ana Boulevard and 
Civic Center Drive, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana officials enacted a similar ordinance in September, 1992, when about 
275 people were camped in the Civic Center. It banned camping activities that 
included sleeping with blankets on public property throughout Santa Ana without 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for homeless people soon challenged that law, as well as a section 
of the state Penal Code used against transients. Police are blocked from 
arresting homeless people under either law until the courts decide if the laws 
are constitutional, although officers may still arrest anyone sleeping in 
public structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Simon, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society of Orange County, asked 
Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert J. Polis on Wednesday to block 
enforcement of the newest ordinance. Polis refused, saying he believes the 
newest law is likely to survive a judicial challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid with this new law, our clients will be punished simply for the 
condition of being homeless," Simon said.ALICIA DI RADO

 Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada, the first lady of Bolivia, met with 
city and county officials on Friday as part of her fund-raising trip to aid 
impoverished children in her country. 
</P>
<P>
 During an hourlong reception at the Hall of Administration, Supervisor Gaddi 
H. Vasquez and City Councilman Robert L. Richardson welcomed De Lozada, who 
called on local residents to contribute money and medical supplies to ease the 
suffering of children in Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children are poor, and we need help from people here who have more to 
give and who have love in their hearts. Our children are our present and our 
future. They need help from all of us," she said.

 About 25% of the children born in Bolivia die before their first birthday. 
Malnutrition, unsafe drinking water and communicable diseases such as 
tuberculosis and diphtheria are responsible for many of those deaths, said 
officials for Ayuda al Nino Boliviano, the Help for Bolivian Children 
organization which is coordinating the fund-raising drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeding a child in Boliva costs about $3 a day, and money raised during de 
Lozada's visit is expected to help thousands of youngsters, said Cora 
Rivero-Jackson, president of the nonprofit Ayuda al Nino Boliviano. 
</P>
<P>
 De Lozada said that money for education is also crucial in a country in which 
67% of the population over 15 are illiterate. "That is the reason we need to 
raise funds. I want to really help my country," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax-deductible donations may be sent to: Ayuda al Nino Boliviano, 23556 St. 
Elena, Mission Viejo, Calif. 92691. For more information, call (714)

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CITY VOTES TO ADD TWO POLICE OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adding two more police officers to the force will help to increase safety for 
the community, the City Council agreed this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously voted to hire the officers at a cost of $123,606, 
which includes salary and benefits for the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty proud to be able to say we're able to hire two officers -- 
especially when people are concerned about having more officers on the street," 
Councilman Guy Carrozzo said. "I think what it does is the efforts of the city 
are being put where the citizens want it." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for the officers is offset by increased revenue from fines and the 
efficiency in processing the citations -- a result of changes in the way 
citations are processed because of a new state law, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor John J. Collins also said that "prudent management and risk-taking of 
the City Council" made the hires possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Elvin G. Miali said that the additional officers will help in the 
response time to emergency calls. The new hires will bring the number of sworn 
police officers to 65, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miali said recruitment will end in February and the new officers should be on 
the streets by March. 
</P>
<P>
 Miali said that during 1993, the city's overall crime rate fell by 7.2%, with 
the exception of homicides. He said the city had six homicides last year, 
including one case in which two men were shot outside a Vietnamese cafe that 
alarmed nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Miali said the department realized the need for police coverage 
to accommodate the changes in the city's demographics, increases in senior 
citizens living in the city, additional traffic volume and an increase in 
overall crime trends. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the total number of calls for service for 1990 was 35,056, 
compared to 44,001 for 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Violent crimes, gang activity and graffiti have also increased, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miali said the department has adapted to the changes by using such strategies 
as soliciting senior citizen volunteers and incorporating administrative duties 
with patrol and investigative duties for supervisory personnel. A special 
enforcement team was also developed to concentrate on gang, graffiti and 
tagging activities.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; TB TESTING RESULTS TERMED GOOD NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's top health officer said Friday that a screening of students 
and teachers found no significant presence of tuberculosis at La Habra High 
School, where a senior girl earlier this month was hospitalized with a 
contagious form of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am exceedingly happy with the results," said Dr. Hugh Stallworth after 
receiving reports that public health nurses who were on campus Friday to read 
the results of tuberculosis skin tests discovered that only 15.6% of the 
students had positive reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth said the 35 positive readings among the 225 students tested who 
were in contact with the contagious student were no higher than the norm. He 
said a 1991 survey taken of a sampling of Orange County students in schools 
with no reports of active tuberculosis found that 17.9% tested positive. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Stallworth said, only one of the 81 teachers and other staff 
members skin-tested positive. And all 14 members of an unidentified boys and 
girls club that the contagious student attended last summer tested negative. 
</P>
<P>
 All students and staff members who showed positive in the skin testing were 
immediately given chest X-rays to determine if they have an active case of 
tuberculosis. The results will be available next week, said Stallworth. But he 
added that he does not believe that any contagious cases will be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Skin testing was recommended at La Habra High School by county health 
officials after all but one of the contagious student's 10 household members 
were found to be infected with inactive tuberculosis. Also eight workers at a 
fast food outlet where she worked skin-tested positive for TB, although their 
lungs were clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth said all students and school staff members whose chest X-rays are 
clear of TB but have positive skin tests will be treated for six months with 
medication that will greatly reduce the risk that the TB will become active.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; STREET REALIGNMENT OKD DESPITE PROTESTS 
</P>

<P>
 Bellehurst residents showed up in force at this week's City Council meeting, 
but their strength in numbers failed to sway the council majority to change 
their vote to align Burlingame Avenue with Dale Street. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 residents, who wore green ribbons as a show of united opposition, 
attended the meeting. They tried to convince the council that making their 
neighborhood street an intersection with Dale Street poses a danger. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council voted 3 to 2 to adopt the final environmental impact report on 
the realignment and to build a railroad underpass on Dale Street. Council 
members also gave final approval of the selection of Burlingame as the 
preferred street to align with Dale. Councilwomen Donna L. Chessen and Rhonda 
J. McCune voted against the project, estimated to cost $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the prestigious neighborhood in the northern part of the city 
expressed disappointment but vowed their battle with city leaders will continue 
-- either with a recall effort or at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue has definitely not died," said Burlingame resident Teri Raymondo. 
"People are so irate and upset for the lack of consideration for residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymondo said residents have collected 263 signatures opposing the project and 
plan to canvass the Bellehurst neighborhood to gather more names for their 
petition. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents believe the alignment will increase traffic, decrease property 
values and pose a safety threat because of speeding motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Other realignment alternatives included placing Dale in line with Monticello 
Avenue, another residential street that leads to the Bellehurst tract, or 
leaving Dale as a T-intersection that dead-ends at Malvern Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, who said they are not against building the railroad underpass, 
favor maintaining a T-intersection because it would not adversely affect the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents said they will examine their options and plan to continue to 
fight the council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Donald L. Bone, who with Councilmen Arthur C. Brown and Don R. Griffith 
comprised the majority in the vote, said Burlingame Avenue is the best 
alignment configuration with Dale Street to improve traffic safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the position and the feelings of those residents who have 
appeared before us," Bone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone also directed city staff to minimize traffic immediately with such 
improvements as speed limit signs or speed bumps.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TALKS IN THE WORKS TO END TOLLWAY BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiations to end the bitter legal battle that environmentalists are waging 
against the San Joaquin Hills tollway are underway, officials said, but how 
promising the talks are remained a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned about talks aimed at resolving the court dispute, tollway spokesman 
Mike Stockstill acknowledged that negotiations have taken place but said: "I 
can't talk about them any further." 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Reynolds, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, also 
confirmed that talks have been ongoing. "They could be fruitful under certain 
circumstances," he said, "but at this point there really isn't anything to 
report." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U. S. District Judge Linda A. McLaughlin, who has been advised of 
the discussions, postponed until March 7 a hearing on the adequacy of the 
$1.1-billion project's environmental impact statement. 
</P>
<P>
 In a terse order, McLaughlin wrote this week that neither side in the court 
case has adequately addressed the impact of the devastating October, 1993, fire 
on the Laguna Greenbelt through which the tollway is to be built. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor did mention the fire 
in a motion seeking to have McLaughlin modify her injunction banning 
construction on parts of the tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin previously permitted construction only at the north and south ends 
of the 15.5-mile project but not in the middle, in the area of the greenbelt. 
Tollway lawyers are arguing that the fire makes protection of the area no 
longer necessary.JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; YOUNG INVENTORS TO SHOW WARES AT FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of young inventors with dreams of fame and cable TV infomercials will 
present their creations at Irvine Valley College's annual invention fair today 
at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers promise the inventions will blend common-sense solutions to 
everyday problems with the imagination only a child could muster. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's projects included a solar-heated toilet seat warmer, a hamster 
leash, a stamp-licking machine and a remote-control vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 The creations come from about 300 elementary and junior high school students 
from the Irvine and Tustin school districts. Their inventions were selected 
from among 3,000 to compete in the Irvine Valley College fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges from local businesses, colleges and grade schools will award prizes in 
a number of categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators said the inventions give students a chance to use the 
problem-solving skills they will need to succeed in the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It encourages them to solve problems," said Dorothy Terman, coordinator of 
science and math curriculum at the Irvine Unified School District. "They 
identify problems in the everyday environment and use reason to deal with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Terman said the invention process also forces students to use information from 
a variety of subjects, including math, science, English and social sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 George McCrory, a spokesman for Irvine Valley College, said the fair gives 
students the feeling that they are creating something of value. "One thing it 
does is show that they can do these things (professionally) when they are 
older," McCrory said. "It gets kids inspired about science." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to displaying the inventions, the fair will present a panel 
discussion on patent law and bringing inventions to market. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can also enter an "On the Spot" invention contest, in which parents 
and their children attempt to turn common household items into useful 
creations.SHELBY GRAD

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DANGER OF MUDSLIDES GROWS WORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's next? 
</P>
<P>
 With forecasters predicting showers Sunday and a likely return to normal 
winter weather patterns -- including frequent rainstorms -- there is rising 
danger of catastrophic rockslides and mudslides in the fire-scorched canyons of 
Malibu, Altadena and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 And experts say the danger has been worsened by Monday's earthquake and 
subsequent aftershocks, which have loosened surface soil and opened new 
fractures in rocks above and below the surface. Unlike a fire, which at least 
has smoke to announce its presence, a slide comes with virtually no warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire you can run from, but flood you can't," Arnold York said. 
</P>
<P>
 York would know. The publisher of the weekly Malibu Times lost his East Malibu 
home in the October wildfires and nearly lost his business when flames raced to 
within garden-hose distance of the newspaper's office in the mouth of Las 
Flores Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the upper canyon denuded of plants, the soil fluffed up and boulders 
cracked and loosened by tremors, just add water and the Malibu Times is 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 York's emergency plan is basic: "If we start getting rain of any intensity, 
we're clearing out." 
</P>
<P>
 A Pacific-based storm system that had seemed to be targeting the coastal 
ranges looks as though it will dump most of its moisture farther north, weather 
forecaster Bruce Thoren said Friday evening. He predicted a quarter- to half an 
inch of rain for Malibu and Altadena, beginning Sunday morning and continuing 
intermittently through the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the longer-term outlook is ominous. The high-pressure zone that has been 
keeping the Southland warmer and drier than usual this winter seems to be 
giving way to a more typical stormy pattern, said Thoren, who works for 
WeatherData Inc. in Wichita, Kan. Another storm developing behind the first one 
could arrive with harder rain by late next week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Benson, hydraulic engineer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Soil 
Conservation Service, toured Las Flores and some of the other Malibu canyons 
after the Monday earthquake. It didn't look good. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quake loosened things up," he said Friday. "It adds new breakage to rocks 
underneath. There are always hairline fractures, but now the fractures are 
bigger. Water acts as a lubricant, and when it gets into those crevices, things 
will move." 
</P>
<P>
 By stripping the surface of chaparral and other cover, the wildfires more than 
tripled the chances of catastrophic slides, Benson estimates. It usually takes 
about 10 inches of rain over a three- or four-day period to trigger a 
devastating slide. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the fire," he said, "three inches will do it." 
</P>
<P>
 There is virtually no private insurance against mudslides or landslides. 
</P>
<P>
 A possible source of relief is the National Flood Insurance Program. However, 
a homeowner's ability to collect on a federal flood insurance policy hinges on 
the seemingly arcane distinction between a mud slide and a mud flow . 
</P>
<P>
 Even if a homeowner has bought national flood insurance -- and most people 
don't -- mud damage will only be covered if a government insurance adjuster 
declares the event a mudflow, said Jack Eldridge, the program's chief for the 
Western U.S. region. 
</P>
<P>
 The simplest way to tell the difference is to scoop up a shovelful of the wet 
debris, he said. If it pours off the shovel like liquid, it's probably a 
mudflow -- a form of flood. But if it falls off in clumps, it's a slide, and 
the program doesn't cover slides. 
</P>
<P>
 The program could be a bargain for homeowners in the fire-ravaged canyons. 
Many parts of Malibu, Altadena and Laguna Beach have not been identified as 
flood zones, so coverage is available at rates as low as $75 a year. The 
coverage, available through insurance companies, is limited to $185,000 for the 
dwelling and $65,000 for its contents. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond encouraging people to enroll in the flood insurance program, government 
officials have been scrambling to complete other measures to lessen the impact 
of hard rain. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Office of Emergency Services and the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency hired the environmental consulting firm of Woodward Clyde to assess the 
danger in Laguna Beach, Malibu and Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Turton, the geotechnical engineer who oversaw the project, identified Las 
Flores and Big Rock canyons in Malibu and the Eaton Canyon area in Altadena as 
particular problem areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach spent $3 million -- reimbursable by the federal and state 
governments -- to cover scorched areas with fast-growing seed and a glue-like 
binder material, which should reduce its risk considerably, Turton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu and Altadena, huge metal grillwork was installed at key drainage 
areas to prevent big rocks from blocking runoff. Culverts were also installed 
in some creek beds to steer water away from streets and other places where it 
could gather speed and force. 
</P>
<P>
 But when an intense storm hits, federal engineer Benson said, "this stuff is 
really like putting a Band-Aid on it. One way or another, this debris is going 
to find its way down to the ocean."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; LANDFILL WILL TRY TO USE EASED RULES TO REOPEN; 
GOVERNMENT: SUNSHINE CANYON OPERATORS HOPE AN EMERGENCY POST-QUAKE PERMIT PLAN 
WILL APPLY TO THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As Los Angeles city officials acted Thursday to reduce the paperwork needed to 
rebuild after the quake, operators of the controversial Sunshine Canyon 
Landfill near Granada Hills said they will try to use the eased requirements to 
reopen their dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., which operated the 
landfill until it was closed in 1991 after city permits expired, also asked the 
Planning Commission to strike a key provision of a proposed law that calls for 
public hearings on projects that are likely to create public opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission had expressed unanimous approval Thursday of a proposal to give 
city administrators power to grant almost instantaneous approval to requests 
for land-use permits -- which are needed to rebuild damaged homes and 
businesses -- in order to hasten quake recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is likely to consider the proposed law next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning-Ferris officials told the commission Thursday that the company hopes 
the emergency law will also apply to them, saying that would allow them to 
temporarily open a section of the landfill to accept earthquake debris, such as 
rubble from the collapsed Antelope Valley and Santa Monica freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 In arguing against the public hearing requirement, Sharon Rubalcava, an 
attorney for Browning-Ferris, said such hearings would only delay the 
earthquake cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let it get mired in a public dispute," she said. "Politics shouldn't be 
allowed to bog down the process." 
</P>
<P>
 But the commission disagreed, saying the public hearing provision was needed 
to give residents affected by the dump a chance to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200-acre landfill, which straddles the city-county boundary in the Santa 
Susana Mountains above Granada Hills, has been a battleground between 
Browning-Ferris and environmentalists and city officials who want to keep the 
dump from expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The portion of the landfill under city jurisdiction was closed in September, 
1991, but the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors had granted 
Browning-Ferris permission in February, 1991, to expand the landfill on 
property wholly located in territory under the county's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and residents near the landfill subsequently sued the county, 
contending that the environmental effects of the expansion plan had not been 
adequately scrutinized. A judge halted the landfill expansion pending the 
outcome of court actions and subsequent public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, who worked for years to close the portion of Sunshine 
Canyon in his district, said he will oppose an attempt by Browning-Ferris to 
open the landfill as an earthquake remedy measure, saying, "It's just another 
way for them to try to get back in." 
</P>
<P>
 He said other landfills, such as Lopez Canyon in Lake View Terrace, can handle 
the earthquake debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Edwards, a spokeswoman for the North Valley Coalition of Concerned 
Citizens, a group that has battled to keep the landfill from expanding, called 
the proposed reopening of Sunshine Canyon "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 She said trucks taking trash to the landfill would have to use San Fernando 
Road, the main surface street detour for motorists driving to and from Santa 
Clarita Valley around the collapsed Antelope Valley Freeway, thus adding to 
growing congestion there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's preposterous," she said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; HOSPITALS' FRONT-LINE WORKERS NEAR BURNOUT; 
STRESS: PSYCHIATRIC COUNSELORS OFFER HELP TO WEARY DOCTORS AND NURSES WHO HAVE 
BEEN LOGGING 14-HOUR DAYS.

<P>
 If Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf had been a psychiatrist, he might have been like 
Dr. Stephen E. Salenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in Army fatigues and black combat boots, the husky, bearded Salenger 
prowls the halls of Northridge Hospital Medical Center, pausing here and there 
to talk with haggard-looking doctors and nurses, offering them words of solace 
and encouragement as if they were battle-weary soldiers headed back to the 
front line. 
</P>
<P>
 Which, in a sense, they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Monday's shattering earthquake, Los Angeles hospitals have treated and 
released 6,547 injured people. Another 1,292 were admitted with serious 
injuries, and many of them are in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 That huge influx, combined with the frustrations of broken equipment and the 
tensions of 14-hour days, have left many hospital workers exhausted to the 
point of burnout. 
</P>
<P>
 At several hospitals, psychiatric counselors have swung into action, advising 
staffers on coping with the twin stresses of caring for hordes of injured 
people even as they struggle to clean up their own quake-tossed homes and 
reassure their aftershock-frazzled families. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kaiser Permanente in Panorama City, a counselor met with employees of the 
optometry department to discuss their feelings after their popular department 
head, Burton Krell, was killed in an auto accident while heading for the 
hospital shortly after the quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in West Los Angeles, a psychiatrist sent one 
employee home after she expressed terror that she would be swallowed up in 
ground softened by repeated aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Just minutes into a quake-stress meeting at the Northridge hospital, situated 
virtually atop the quake's epicenter, a middle-aged nurse stood up and walked 
swiftly from the room. Returning later, she said she had thrown up -- a 
reaction to days of trying to suppress her fears of the quake and its 
aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been acting braver than I really am," she said. "Suddenly just now I 
felt this awful nausea. I thought I was doing quite well until that point." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same meeting, a young emergency room technician expressed shame over 
not rushing to the hospital right after the quake; a top executive said he was 
angry at political "looky-loos" -- including Gayle Wilson, the governor's wife 
-- for appearing at the overloaded hospital for photo opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge hospital officials acknowledge that day after day of 12- and 
14-hour shifts -- combined with worries over quake-damaged homes and anxious 
spouses and children -- are wearing down staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a massive amount of psychic trauma, and around here it's not letting 
up," said Dr. Paul Karis, who supervises the emergency-room staff at 
Northridge, which has treated more than 600 quake victims since Monday. "The 
staff is just running out of steam." 
</P>
<P>
 Karis told of approaching another Northridge doctor a couple of days after the 
quake to ask how he was holding up. 
</P>
<P>
 The other man erupted in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the first person you see in the morning . . . and he says he has several 
patients with chest pains, one with a heart attack. His house is basically 
condemned, he hasn't slept more than six hours in the past three days," Karis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His wife is coming apart, his kids won't stop crying. His brick wall fell 
down, and the dogs ran away." 
</P>
<P>
 Some hospitals also have set up day-care centers for employees whose regular 
day-care arrangements were canceled or who simply cannot bear to be separated 
from their children at the moment -- or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 To help stressed-out staffers at Northridge, psychiatrist Salenger and three 
dozen other doctors, nurses and emergency workers were brought in under a 
little-known federal program, the National Disaster Medical System, which 
dispatches teams of medical workers to back up local ones overwhelmed during 
major disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Salenger's team, which also responded in Hawaii after Hurricane Iniki, wears 
distinctive blue jumpsuits or military fatigues; many members also wear combat 
boots. Most of them work at hospitals and fire departments in San Bernardino 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Striding the corridors at Northridge in his camouflage combat outfit, 
Salenger, chief of staff at Patton State Hospital, a psychiatric facility in 
San Bernardino, sought to reassure anxiety-ridden staffers that their reactions 
were nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not psychological problems," he said. "This is not mental illness. 
These are normal reactions to abnormal situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Salenger described their problems as "critical incident stress," saying the 
best treatment is simply to give workers a chance to vent their feelings and 
fears -- while on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Although temporary, if untreated, such stress can metamorphose into far more 
serious post-traumatic stress disorder, a mental disturbance suffered by some 
Vietnam War veterans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Geoffrey Newstadt, head of emergency psychiatry at Cedars-Sinai, said his 
unit has counseled a number of staffers "in crisis" as a result of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't hear a lot of people on Monday and Tuesday say, 'I'm scared,' " he 
said. "I've heard a lot of people say that today," he said earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Newstadt added that many staffers also tell of bizarre and frightening dreams, 
probably set off by the quake. Others complain of sleeplessness due to the 
aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing quite so unnerving as the earth moving and buildings falling 
down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But hospital officials note that the surge in patient numbers won't last 
forever. And they add that the best medicine for their staffs may be simply 
talking out their problems -- while sticking with their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more they tell their story, the more they can put it into perspective," 
said Bonnie Lipton, head of social workers at Kaiser in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they can do this while working."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FEWER INCIDENTS OF CRIME REPORTED IN COUNTY; 
POLICING: EXTRA PATROLS PREVENTED LOOTING IN DAMAGED AREAS. BUT THIEVES STRUCK 
AT TWO UNGUARDED SIMI VALLEY SCHOOLS. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite fears that darkened and abandoned homes and businesses damaged in 
Monday's earthquake might be ripe pickings for vandals, law enforcement 
authorities said crime in Ventura County actually decreased following the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 With electricity knocked out in most of the county, police departments and 
Ventura County sheriff's deputies mobilized, assigning officers to patrol 
streets and protect businesses where broken windows and collapsed walls left 
them vulnerable to theft. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, one of the hardest hit areas in the county, authorities said 
they received a few reports of possible vandalism, but could find only broken 
windows on arrival. And what some callers reported as suspicious cars cruising 
neighborhoods turned out to be officers in unmarked cars patrolling the 
streets, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 But two unguarded Simi Valley elementary schools, one damaged in the quake and 
the other left unscathed, were hit by thieves this week. The burglars stole 
televisions, videocassette recorders and other equipment, said Susan Parks, 
assistant superintendent at the Simi Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a situation like this, I call it looting," she said. "It makes you sick to 
think this happened in our own town." Employees are now guarding schools in the 
district, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, where two Ventura County sheriff's deputies normally patrol the 
entire city, 22 uniformed officers were dispatched and on the scene by early 
Monday to protect the devastated downtown area, said Sheriff's Lt. Dick Diaz, 
who heads Fillmore's law enforcement department. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers surrounded the two-block area, where many of the brick buildings 
collapsed. Later in the week, a six-foot chain-link fence was erected around 
the area, with deputies stationed inside and outside the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearby mobile home park, which was evacuated, was also patrolled and no 
looting was reported, Diaz said. Private security guards have since taken over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're isolated out here," Diaz said. "The people here who might have been 
tempted were involved in the earthquake and weren't out doing crime," Diaz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there have been two burglaries reported since Monday at homes that 
were occupied. "So it's hard to say if that's earthquake-related," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall in the county, reports of crime in areas served by the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department were down sharply Monday, followed by an increase up to 
near-normal levels in the days since, said Lt. Gary Markley. But, he said, it 
is difficult to say whether the decrease in crime reports is due to the 
earthquake or interrupted telephone service in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department serves Moorpark, Thousand Oaks, Fillmore, Camarillo, 
Ojai and unincorporated areas surrounding the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were busier than ever with calls for broken gas lines and falling walls," 
Markley said. "But the number of crimes reported and the number of emergency 
calls that someone is being threatened with a gun or knife were way down." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula, where the historic brick buildings downtown survived the 
quake, there were no reports of vandalism despite the lack of power, said Cmdr. 
Mark Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened at 4:30 in the morning and it was only a couple of hours until 
daylight," he said. "'But we were gearing up to have high visibility if the 
power was still out that night." Power was restored by afternoon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the city of Oxnard, the thieves stayed home, possibly to watch television 
reports of the earthquake damage, said Oxnard Police Department spokesman David 
Keith.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they'll make up for it next week and get back to their usual 
routine," he said. "Crime fell off during the Gulf War in 1991 when the crooks 
and everybody else were glued to CNN." 
</P>
<P>
 No data was available in Ventura, but Lt. Steve Bowman said calls for service 
were down since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were focused on other things," he said.

<P>
 A 17-year-old boy suspected of trying to rob a shoe store employee as he made 
a night deposit at a downtown bank was overpowered by the intended victim and 
several bystanders who held him down until police arrived, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee, Paul Ruiz, 26, was making a deposit at 10 p.m. Thursday at Bank 
of America, 18691 Main St., when the incident occurred, Police Sgt. Larry 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruiz was approached by a 17-year-old who hit him twice on the head with a 
metal flashlight and said, 'Give us the money!' " Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, a second teen-ager grabbed Ruiz but let go of him and ran away 
after noticing several bystanders running toward them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz, who suffered minor cuts, grabbed onto the 17-year-old before he could 
flee, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to the victim's aggressive resistance and the help from others, the 
suspects were not successful in taking the deposit," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flashlight was recovered at the scene. The 17-year-old, who was not 
identified because of his age, was booked into Juvenile Hall on suspicion of 
robbery. The second attacker remains at large.GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; PANEL GRAPPLES WITH ADULT-BUSINESS LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a year of preparation, Mission Viejo's proposed laws regulating adult 
businesses will go before the City Council on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have decided to separate the proposed adult business law into 
three parts and look at them as individual ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer we looked at this, the more complex it got," said Planning 
Commissioner Sherri Butterfield. "The fact that our (Assistant City Atty. John 
Cavanaugh) ended up breaking (one law) into three ordinances suggests the 
complexity of this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 One ordinance will attempt to control any influx of adult businesses by 
limiting them to four areas in the city -- off El Toro Road just north of 
Marguerite Parkway; Maquina and Acero; Obrero Drive and Via Fabricante and 
Crown Valley Parkway and Los Altos. No more than nine adult businesses will be 
permitted in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The other ordinances will make topless dancing illegal in Mission Viejo and 
regulate massage parlors by requiring masseuses to be certified professionals 
with at least 100 hours of training. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have also spent the past year educating people on several 
occasions in protest of the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's partially what has made this process so difficult," said Butterfield, 
who, along with the rest of the commission and city staff, worked on the 
ordinance throughout 1993. "Just as we would get one roomful educated about the 
ordinance, the next roomful would come in. It feels like we've started over on 
the education process about five times." 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents have called for a city ordinance that banishes all adult 
businesses. However, the Supreme Court has consistently ruled against 
communities that have tried to legislate adult businesses out of existence, say 
legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as September, more than 100 people appeared at a planning commission 
meeting to protest the proposed ordinance. But at a commission meeting earlier 
this month, only a handful of people showed up.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; SILVERMAN TO HEAD UCI HEALTH PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening said Friday she has appointed an 
associate vice chancellor who will be responsible for the development of the 
Center for Health Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening appointed Paul H. Silverman, a former university president, 
laboratory director and scientist, who will be in charge of coordinating 
efforts to plan a $350-million medical research and clinical complex on the 
west side of campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman, 69, who postponed retirement to take the one-year appointment, will 
fill a key role vacated when Dr. Walter Henry abruptly resigned last month as 
vice chancellor of health sciences and dean of the UCI College of Medicine. 
Silverman will assume the position March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening is expected to choose an interim dean next month to head the medical 
school until a permanent dean is hired. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI spokeswoman Linda Granell said Silverman will be paid an annual salary of 
$136,000. By contrast, she said, Henry received $205,896 a year. Granell said 
Wilkening will not replace a consultant who was assisting Henry on the Center 
for Health Sciences project and was earning $99,632 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman served the past three years as director of scientific affairs at 
Beckman Instruments in Fullerton, acting as the corporation's link with key 
scientists, academic centers and licensing agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In his long career, Silverman was director of the University of California 
Biotechnology Research and Education Program, which fosters collaborations 
between UC science laboratories and industry. He also served as president of 
the University of Maine from 1980 to 1984 and as provost for research and 
graduate studies and president of the Research Foundation for the State 
University of New York from 1977-80. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman, who lives in Irvine, said, "From what I see, there is an excellent 
foundation on which to build." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he expects to be ready for bids on the first phase of the Center for 
Health Sciences -- construction of a Neurological Research Institute -- within 
a year.LESLIE BERKMAN

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; WILSON ADVISER PREDICTS SWIFT ECONOMIC 
RECOVERY; IMPACT: ECONOMIST SAYS OVERALL EFFECT OF THE QUAKE ON THE 
RECESSION-BOUND STATE WILL BE A 'MINOR EVENT.' TWO BUSINESS LEADERS DISAGREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The chief economic adviser to Gov. Pete Wilson forecast Friday that the 
California economy will recover so swiftly from the San Fernando Valley 
earthquake that its overall effect will be only a "minor event." 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Phillip Romero made the upbeat assessment at a news conference 
called by Wilson Administration officials and business leaders to promote 
California as a good place to visit and do business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that confidence will come back quickly and this will, within a year, 
be a minor event in the context of California's overall economy," Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 The news conference themes closely reflected those of Wilson's campaign as the 
governor seeks to portray recession-weary California as re-emerging as a 
serious competitor in the global marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Meier Wright, secretary of the state Trade and Commerce Agency, said 
Administration officials did not want to sugarcoat the economic severity of the 
6.6 temblor but wanted to assure business investors that steps were being taken 
to mitigate them. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the California Highway Patrol is telling out-of-state tourists that 
most of Southern California remains a good place to visit and there might be 
"lighter than usual crowds at well-known locations." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero said he based his recovery forecast, in part, on the ability of local 
economies to bounce back swiftly from such disastrous events as the Loma Prieta 
earthquake in 1989 and the wildfires that savaged parts of Los Angeles only a 
couple of months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the proposed swift expenditure of vast funds on reconstruction 
projects typically brings about 15% to 25% "more economic bang for the buck 
than dollars spent on consumption. . . . Those dollars will stimulate the 
economy substantially faster than if they were spent for normal purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the Los Angeles area economy represents half the state's annual 
$800-billion production of goods and services a year. "There are several 
hundred Northridges in the giant L.A. economy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But William Campbell, president of the California Manufacturers Assn., and 
Kirk West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce, refused to endorse 
Romero's characterization of the potential economic impact as a "minor event." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not use that term," said West, who flanked Romero at the news 
conference. West and Campbell did express confidence that the economy would 
recover swiftly.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; 8 COUNTY BRIDGES REINFORCED FOR QUAKE SAFETY, 
CALTRANS REPORTS; TRANSPORTATION: EIGHT OTHER STRUCTURES ARE UNDER 
RECONSTRUCTION AND 18 MORE WILL BE RETROFITTED AS PART OF THE ONGOING 
FORTIFICATION PROGRAM, ACCORDING TO OFFICIALS.

<P>
 Eight of Ventura County's 322 elevated highway sections have been recently 
reinforced to withstand the impact of a major earthquake, with eight more 
bridges currently under reconstruction and 18 others slated for retrofitting, 
Caltrans officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have done is we have inventoried, examined and considered every 
bridge in Ventura County," California Department of Transportation spokesman 
Jim Drago said of the ongoing fortification program. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the ones that were determined to be candidates for retrofitting," 
Drago said. "The list is dynamic. . . . There could be bridges added, 
particularly in a case like this earthquake, where there was some new seismic 
activity discovered, i.e. a new fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Caltrans officials said Friday they had completed preliminary and 
follow-up inspections of all bridges and freeway overpasses in Ventura County 
in the wake of Monday's quake and subsequent aftershocks and proclaimed all 
open and safe to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't foresee any problems on the freeways and I haven't heard of any," 
said Bob Houle, an associate transportation engineer. "Everything's open and 
functioning." 
</P>
<P>
 In the program for seismic reinforcements, Drago said determining exactly 
which bridges need shoring up depends on several factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We identify bridges which we consider candidates for retrofitting. What 
happens then is that a team of Caltrans engineers are given the job of 
examining the bridge in detail," Drago said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They determine the forces that could be generated by the maximum credible 
earthquake that could hit that site," Drago said. "They then track those forces 
through the bridge to see what happens to those forces when they would strike 
the bridge and they develop a strengthening technique." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans launched a major program to inspect overpasses, bridges and highway 
interchanges after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, when a double-decked 
segment of the Nimitz Freeway collapsed onto a stream of rush-hour traffic in 
Oakland, sending the quake's death toll soaring. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridges that have been retrofitted in Ventura County are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ash Street pedestrian crossing over the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chestnut Street overhead bridge at the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * Padre Juan Canyon bridge on the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hill Road pedestrian crossing over California 126. 
</P>
<P>
 * Laurie Lane bridge at California 126. 
</P>
<P>
 * El Rio underpass on Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 * Olsen Road overpass on California 23. 
</P>
<P>
 * Casitas Vista Road on California 33. 
</P>
<P>
 The retrofitting work often involves digging around the footing of a bridge 
and adding steel and additional concrete. Bridge decks are also hooked with 
cables that would keep them from falling to the ground in the case of an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Highway workers were out on the Simi Valley Freeway again Friday, grinding 
down or repaving buckled portions of the ramps leading to the freeway from 
surface streets in the city's hard-hit east end. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's freeway system generally fared well through Monday's quake and 
aftershocks that continued through Friday, said Dave Servaes, Caltrans' 
regional manager for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 One freeway overpass was briefly closed about 2 p.m. Wednesday after drivers 
reported cracks in the Sunset Hills Boulevard bridge that passes over 
California 23 in Thousand Oaks. A Caltrans inspector investigating the 
complaint determined that the chipping was superficial and that the overpass 
was safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we have an aftershock, we get deluged with phone calls that the 
bridges are falling down and we go look again and it's the same thing we found 
before," Servaes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not having to shore up anything," Servaes said. "We've had some 
problems with the approaches and departures on a couple of the bridges that 
we're working on right now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not as many bridges and they're not as big (as in Los Angeles 
County)," he said. "The big bridges that we have out here, like the 118 and the 
23 (the Moorpark-Simi Valley freeway connector), that's a huge, long one but 
it's built with the latest technology and it came through it OK, and that's not 
because it didn't shake -- I can tell you that."

FIRED GARBAGE TRUCK DRIVERS REHIRED AFTER WALKOUT; LABOR: WASTE MANAGEMENT 
REPRIMANDS THE THREE DRIVERS. TRASH PICKUP, DELAYED BY THE FIVE-HOUR STRIKE 
THURSDAY, RESUMES IN FIVE CITIES. 
</P>

<P>
 Three trash truck drivers whose firings touched off a five-hour wildcat 
walkout by 100 co-workers at a trash collection company Thursday have been 
rehired, a company spokeswoman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Management reviewed the cases of the employees who were terminated and 
decided they would be reprimanded and be rehired," said Michele Blair, 
spokeswoman for Waste Management Inc. of Orange County. "Essentially, the fired 
drivers got warnings." 
</P>
<P>
 The brief wildcat strike on Thursday delayed garbage pickups in five cities -- 
Irvine, Laguna Hills, Mission Viejo, Laguna Beach and Lake Forest -- as well as 
some unincorporated parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The drivers, who are not organized in a labor union, said they staged the job 
action to protest their anger over the firings earlier this week of the three 
co-workers, who were accused by management of "taking unauthorized breaks on 
company time." They were not identified by company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers complained that the firings were unwarranted and came during the 
introduction of harsh new rules for drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 One driver, who demanded anonymity because of fear of job security, has said 
new company administrators had been pushing drivers to increase the amount of 
trash they collect by adding more stops to their routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, management had reduced annual vacations and had threatened harsher 
discipline for relatively small infractions, the drivers said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, city officials at three of the five cities -- Mission Viejo, Lake 
Forest and Irvine -- reported that there were no complaints about problems with 
garbage pickups. Officials at Laguna Beach and Laguna Hills could not be 
reached for comment.

 "We have not had any complaints," said Cindy Asher, an Irvine waste management 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair said that after the walkout, drivers returned to their trucks and 
resumed trash pickups Thursday afternoon. Waste Management officials also 
brought in drivers from the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lost time, trash truck drivers "got almost everything done on 
Thursday," Blair said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SIMI VALLEY ELDERLY ARE HIT HARD BY EARTHQUAKE; 
RECOVERY: MANY ARE RESIDENTS OF MOBILE HOME PARKS, WHICH TOOK A POUNDING. 
SETTING THINGS RIGHT WILL BE EXPENSIVE.

<P>
 As many Simi Valley residents piece their lives back together in the wake of 
Monday's earthquake, hundreds of the city's most vulnerable citizens are still 
struggling to cope with the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the city's elderly, living in mobile home parks in Simi Valley's 
hard-hit east end, are still without water, gas or electricity because of line 
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 They are staying in shelters or with relatives or sleeping in their cars, 
returning to their crumpled mobile homes each day to seek out friends and wait 
for inspectors to tell them if their coaches are inhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many of these people it's very unsettling, because their homes are 
everything to them," said Alice Martens, who manages Susana Woods, a 139-coach 
park inhabited almost entirely by senior citizens. "Now they've been cut off. A 
lot of people are feeling hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde and Marjorie Lynch have been staying with their daughter since their 
mobile home at Susana Woods buckled and slid 4 feet off its supports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on a teeter-totter," said Marjorie Lynch, 73. "When I'm at my daughter's, 
I feel like I should be here in case the inspectors come by. And when I'm here, 
I get so upset I just can't take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Choking back tears, Lynch gestured to one side of the coach, which is tilted 3 
feet off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made my grandchildren come in through there so they wouldn't get my carpet 
dirty," she said, pointing to a side door that hung half off its hinges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As an aftershock shook the awning outside Nancy Moore's nearby coach, she 
moaned in despair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, God, when is this going to end?" asked Moore, 58. Her mobile home sank 2 
feet during the quake, forcing metal supports up through her living room floor. 
"I'm tired, tired, tired." 
</P>
<P>
 At Friendly Village, a mobile home park on the west side of town, Theodora 
Rocke tried to coax her mother to stay in a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll be much more comfortable," Rocke told her. "You can't stay here 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocke had driven from her home in Orange County to help her mother, whose 
mobile home was one of 189 in the park that were badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to go to any damn motel," said Maurine Hemphill, 78. "I want to 
stay here, where I can be with my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross volunteers are delivering meals to senior citizens at five mobile 
home parks, and volunteers from Oasis, a nonprofit agency in Simi Valley that 
assists the elderly, are visiting the parks to offer blankets and food. 
</P>
<P>
 Oasis also is providing money for medicine, eyeglasses and hearing aids that 
may have been lost in the confusion after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing everything we can think of," Oasis director Veronica Spalding 
said. "If someone tells us they need something, we're trying to get it for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the agency also is seeking residents willing to take in senior 
citizens until the coach repair work is finished. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Senior Center is helping residents who are seeking financial 
aid from the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to offer a quiet place where seniors can come to relax and get 
away from the stress of the disaster," said Kathryn Oliver, senior services 
coordinator. "We can also help them figure out where to go to get help from the 
government so they can get things back to normal as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Repairing individual coaches can cost from $800 to $8,000, according to 
residents and managers at mobile home parks around the city. Earthquake braces, 
which provide extra support, cost an additional $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be really hard on the ones without insurance," Martens said. 
"And I know there are plenty." 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, coaches damaged in an earthquake must be examined by state 
inspectors before residents can move back in. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents will be charged $120 for the inspections, said Jack Kerin, field 
operations manager for the mobile home division of the Department of Housing 
and Community Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Two offices are being set up in Los Angeles County to process permit 
applications starting Monday, but none have yet been scheduled for Ventura 
County, Kerin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a demand, we may be able to get a temporary office in Ventura," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a state mobile home ombudsman to handle individual problems. The 
telephone number is (800) 952-5275. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 To find out more about emergency services for the elderly, contact Oasis of 
Simi Valley, 5649 East Pittman St., at 526-3009 or the Simi Valley Senior 
Citizens Center, 3900 Avenida Simi, at 526-9237.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; 400 DEAD FISH REMOVED FROM SANTA CLARA RIVER; 
OIL SPILL: AN ENDANGERED STICKLEBACK IS AMONG THE CARP AND CHUBS KILLED AFTER 
EARTHQUAKE CAUSED PIPE- LINE TO RUPTURE. 
</P>

<P>
 Wildlife authorities have scooped up nearly 400 dead fish floating along a 12- 
to 15-mile stretch of the Santa Clara River east of Piru that was blackened 
when an oil pipeline ruptured, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the dead fish picked out of the river was an endangered species known 
as the unarmored three-spined stickleback. Most of the others were common chubs 
or carp. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews working to rescue wildlife and clean up the spill caused by Monday's 
earthquake also recovered 11 oiled waterfowl and saw an oiled egret that they 
could not capture. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the birds recovered were dead, including a pair of mallards, a 
northern shrike and a rail. Workers found no least Bell's vireos, an endangered 
songbird that nests in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this demonstrates once again the problems with putting pipelines near 
riverbeds and sensitive areas," said Ron Bottorff, director of the Friends of 
the Santa Clara River. "People worry about tankers, but the problems lately 
have occurred with pipelines." 
</P>
<P>
 Bottorff pointed out that a 1991 oil spill occurred in the same stretch of the 
Santa Clara River and another spill discovered on Christmas Day at McGrath 
Lake, a wetlands area near McGrath State Beach near Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities do not yet know whether the fish and wildlife were killed by the 
oil or by chlorine, which was added to treated waste water discharged into the 
river by the Valencia sewage treatment plant. The plant is operated by the Los 
Angeles County Sanitation Districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other treatment plants, the Valencia plant routinely removes 
chlorine to protect fish before waste water is discharged. But after Monday's 
quake, plant officials decided to leave in the chlorine to protect human health 
and safety in case the waste water contained bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant officials said their system to remove the chlorine also may have been 
damaged. They reactivated the system and began removing the chlorine again at 2 
p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Heal the Bay, an environmental watchdog organization based in Santa Monica, 
along with the Friends of the Santa Clara River in Ventura County, on Friday 
denounced the use of chlorine in the waste water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Gold, executive director of Heal the Bay, contacted the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office, which will determine next week whether an 
investigation is warranted, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a crew of about 350 people continued to remove the thick crude. By 
Friday, workers had vacuumed up about 71,000 gallons of the 147,000 to 168,000 
gallons of oil that spilled, said Albert Greenstein, a spokesman for Atlantic 
Richfield, parent company of Four Corners Pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 He said workers will continue throughout the weekend, unless rain forces them 
to stop.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; AFTERSHOCKS PROMPT NEW INSPECTIONS AT CSUN; 
EDUCATION: ALL MAJOR STRUCTURES WILL BE REASSESSED FOR DAMAGE. OFFICIALS STILL 
AIM FOR A FEB. 14 REOPENING. 
</P>

 In the wake of a series of severe aftershocks that rocked an already heavily 
damaged campus, Cal State Northridge President Blenda J. Wilson announced 
Friday that all 53 of the school's major structures would have to be 
reinspected before a final damage assessment can be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Friday's aftershocks, engineers were prepared to announce that 80% of 
the buildings made it through the temblor and its initial aftershocks without 
debilitating structural damage.  
</P>
<P>
 "After the last shocks, those evaluations are no longer valid," Wilson said. 
"We will have to reassess everything over the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the setback, administrators expect to reopen the campus by Feb. 14, 
two weeks after the scheduled start of the second semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit by the initial quake were a $15-million, four-story parking 
structure that collapsed onto itself, the Delmar T. Oviatt Library, which lost 
portions of its roof, the fine arts building, the seven-story Sierra Tower and 
the sciences complex, which suffered a fire as well as chemical and biological 
spills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Library South, which houses the campus mainframe computers and most of its 
electronic records including student files, payroll information and electronic 
registration data, survived the initial quakes, but aftershocks left the 
structure unstable and its future uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Curzon, vice provost of information and technical resources on campus, was 
in the South Library to retrieve critical data for the registration system 
Friday when the aftershocks hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like the building might collapse," Curzon said of the structure, 
which was ruled unstable by engineers before Friday's aftershocks. "I was just 
hoping we had the tapes." She said most of the crucial data was obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 Curzon also toured the Oviatt Library after the quake to assess damage. She 
described the interior as "knee-deep" in books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is off the shelves," she said. "There are 600,000 volumes on the 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the buildings damaged, several structures are plagued with 
asbestos exposed by the quake, which will have to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said official assessments of the losses will not be available until 
final inspections are completed, but she estimated those figures to be in the 
"hundreds of millions" of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was confident that classes could begin Feb. 14, with the 
assistance of the computer system at Cal State Fresno for registration and the 
use of trailers, community agencies and other facilities for classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we can do it," Wilson said. "We just want the ground to stop shaking 
under us."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; MOTORISTS WARNED TO EXPECT WORSE ON MONDAY; 
TRAFFIC: RIORDAN LIKELY TO ANNOUNCE CONTINGENCY PLANS. METROLINK ROUTE WILL BE 
EXTENDED AND NEW STATIONS ADDED.

 Transportation officials said Friday that commuters going into Los Angeles had 
better brace for post-earthquake congestion to get worse next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The crippled freeways and jammed side streets will be filled with more people 
returning to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people did not attempt to get to work after the earthquake," said Frank 
White, chief of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
"But on Monday -- we are all afraid of what we will face." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to ease what could be monumental traffic jams, Mayor Richard 
Riordan intends to announce a plan today to relieve congestion on city streets. 
Riordan is considering converting some east-west streets, such as Pico and 
Olympic boulevards, into one-way thoroughfares, Deputy Mayor Rae James said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, transportation officials are preparing for a worst-case scenario: 
rain along with the typical workday volume of commuters on the region's freeway 
network, which suffered damage on six roadways -- including the Golden State, 
Antelope Valley and Simi Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternate routes along surface streets can handle only 60% of the traffic 
diverted from broken freeways, said Robert R. Yates, general manager of the Los 
Angeles Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not drive alone, Yates and others urged. Take public transit or car-pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The key choke points, transportation officials say, are at the downed portion 
of the Santa Monica Freeway -- usually traversed by about 340,000 motorists 
daily -- and the main arteries into the Santa Clarita Valley, which typically 
carried more than 200,000 vehicles daily. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days since the 6.6-magnitude earthquake, transportation officials have 
struggled to increase options for beleaguered commuters. Workers have scurried 
to clear the debris from freeways, removing nearly 5,000 yards of concrete and 
steel rubble from the collapsed Interstate 5 and Antelope Valley Freeway. 
Engineers frantically analyzed detour routes. Transit planners mapped out new 
stations for commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Monday, the Santa Clarita Metrolink commuter train will extend its 
route 50 miles, using freight tracks, to include station stops in Palmdale and 
Lancaster. A station at Vincent on that route will open Jan. 31. A fourth 
station, in Canyon Country at Via Princessa, is expected to open Feb. 7. For 
the rest of the month, Metrolink officials say they will honor Antelope Valley 
Transit passes and tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 White said the agency also plans to open another new route, with stations in 
Northridge and Camarillo in February. Sites for those two stations have not 
been selected. Some of the new stations are expected to be rudimentary, with 
gravel lots for parking and a wooden platform. "But I am quite sure commuters 
will be pleased with even that," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the flow of motorists from north county communities, Caltrans has 
worked to shorten detours along the Golden State Freeway. Jerry Baxter, head of 
the Caltrans district office, said crews hoped to open an alternate route 
Tuesday that would utilize The Old Road near Weldon Canyon Road to Calgrove 
Boulevard in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This route would allow two lanes of traffic in each direction, Baxter said. In 
the days ahead, officials will decide whether to convert the newly opened lanes 
on the Golden State to car-pool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 With inspection reports arriving continually, Caltrans officials said the 
status of roads can quickly change. On Friday afternoon, officials closed 
connectors between the westbound Ventura Freeway to the southbound and 
northbound Glendale Freeway. They also shut the connector between the eastbound 
Ventura to the southbound Glendale Freeway. The interchange is expected to 
remain closed for two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime we have to close something else, it's not good news," said Caltrans 
spokesman Russ Snyder, who added that it was not known whether those newly 
closed interchanges, which need shoring up, were damaged in Monday's quake or 
the aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 To help Westside commuters who use the Santa Monica Freeway, the MTA has 
started a new bus line and will deploy 20 additional buses to five routes: 
Lines 2, 4, 20-320, 439 and 454. The new Westside Special bus, which started 
service Thursday, begins at the westernmost part of its route, at Pacific Coast 
Highway and Temescal Canyon Road near Will Rogers State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles officials tried to fix traffic lights, which have 
impeded traffic flow, predominantly on the Westside. Most of the 6,400 miles of 
city streets were virtually untouched by the earthquake, except in areas along 
the Santa Monica Freeway where debris showered down upon thoroughfares. But 38 
traffic signals -- including 26 that were affected by the downed Santa Monica 
Freeway -- have stopped working. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks ahead, officials said they will evaluate other proposals -- such 
as establishing a dedicated busway along the old trolley right of way on 
Exposition Boulevard. They said they also will consider giving preferential 
treatment to high-occupancy vehicles on selected streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan is expected to direct city personnel to work staggered hours, having 
them use headquarters close to their homes. Some workers living in the San 
Fernando Valley would work in Van Nuys City Hall. Others will work from home 
using their telephones or computers, James said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding industry, the mayor is expected to urge large employers to set up 
staggered work hours and to have shuttle buses bring employees to mass transit 
stations. Riordan cannot order employers to carry out such practices, but 
private employers have been cooperative in conversations, James said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also is expected to announce dedicated lanes for trucks. Much of the 
mayor's strategy is based on techniques used during the 1984 Olympics.

FIRM ASKS D.A. TO REVIEW RADIO CONTRACT BIDDING PROCESS; COUNTY: FLORIDA 
COMPANY ALLEGES SELECTION IS RIGGED TO FAVOR RIVAL DESPITE $6-MILLION 
DIFFERENCE. SUPERVISORS ARE SCHEDULED TO VOTE ON MATTER TUESDAY. 
</P>

<P>
 A Florida company has asked the district attorney's office to review the 
company's allegations that the selection process for an $80-million county law 
enforcement radio contract was rigged to favor a rival bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harris Corp. stands to lose the large contract to Motorola Communications 
and Electronics Inc. when the Board of Supervisors meets Tuesday to award the 
bid. Harris officials acknowledged Friday that they have requested that 
prosecutors investigate whether the contract process had been compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi has declined comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said Friday that he was not 
aware of the district attorney's involvement and thought the Harris request for 
review should not delay a vote on the contract Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is expected to award the contract to Motorola. The decision could 
cost the county and local cities at least $6 million more than the Harris bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on what I know, this thing with Harris is sour grapes," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris has accused county officials of leaking confidential documents about 
Harris' contract proposal to the competing firm during the competitive 
selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the serious and frequency of (contract procurement) 
inconsistencies, we took the unprecedented step of sharing our concerns with 
the district attorney's office," Harris' senior manager R.C. Ford wrote in a 
letter to board Chairman Thomas F. Riley. "We assure you that Harris took this 
action with full appreciation of its serious and significant import." 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola consultant Randy Smith, who earlier this week referred to the Harris 
claims as "manufactured bull," could not be reached for comment late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio contract is one of the biggest in county history and is designed to 
improve police radio communications countywide during emergencies, such as 
Monday's Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The board originally voted to award the contract to Harris on the condition 
that the company satisfy seven technical concerns. A county review team has 
since found that Harris failed to meet those standards. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter to Riley, Ford said company officials met with the district 
attorney Wednesday. Although the letter did not reveal details of that meeting, 
Ford said that "it is our understanding that the district attorney is currently 
reviewing this entire matter." 
</P>
<P>
 "Harris is deeply concerned that the board may take action detrimental to 
Orange County without benefit of all relevant information," Ford wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Ford outlined a number of alleged improprieties to the supervisors 
relating to the contract process. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford alleged that 25 pages containing 200 questions about the Harris proposal 
were transmitted by county staffers to Motorola in March, 1992. Ford said that 
at that time the questions would have provided Motorola with a "clear 
understanding" of the Harris plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola's Smith has acknowledged some questions regarding the Harris proposal 
were mistakenly faxed to Motorola by county staff. Smith said the questions 
were contained on one page and that county officials were immediately notified. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris has also alleged that a San Francisco-based consulting firm hired by 
the county to review the two proposals was not recognized as a specialist in 
public safety systems. The firm, C.S.I. Telecommunications, favored Motorola in 
its review.

BRANCH AIDE VOWS TO RESIST JOB TRANSFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nancy L. Smith, whose office romance with Orange County Recorder Lee A. Branch 
was found to have seriously disrupted the department, will fight any effort to 
transfer her to another county job, her attorney said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A recommendation to transfer Smith -- a 22-year employee and supervisor in the 
recorder's office -- was included in scathing county reports that upheld 
allegations of sexual harassment and mismanagement by Branch. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigative reports, made public Thursday, also found that Branch's 
relationship with Smith created a hostile work environment for other employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that any transfer is politically motivated and part of the Board of 
Supervisors' hidden agenda against the recorder's office," said attorney Lloyd 
Charton, who represents Smith and Branch. "She doesn't want to go and learn a 
new job." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Branch have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Branch has said he 
will seek reelection this year, despite calls for his resignation from top 
county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 During a three-month county investigation, employees complained that Branch 
showed favoritism to Smith in the office and allowed her wide latitude in 
dealing with matters beyond her authority. Employees alleged that Smith used 
that authority to intimidate workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other findings in the reports related to Smith were that Branch allegedly 
barred Assistant Recorder Ella M. Murphy from evaluating Smith's work 
performance for nine years and that Smith had been granted a "preferential" 
work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch has defended his relationship with Smith, saying that the two had been 
able to keep their personal lives out of daily business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Smith) has every intention of fighting a transfer and suing if they attempt 
it," Charton said. "This is just a manifestation of the chicken way the county 
has handled this."

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY OKD FOR POSSIBLE FREE ALTERNATIVE TO TOLL ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO and FRANK MESSINA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county has authorized an environmental study for what could become a free 
alternative to the planned and as yet unbuilt portion of the Foothill toll road 
between Antonio Parkway and Ortega Highway, county officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one county official acknowledged that the environmental impact report 
is partially in response to the potential development of a new community south 
of Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county will consider (an alternative road, but) the timing will depend on 
the development proposals for that area by the Santa Margarita Co.," said Harry 
Persaud, chief of transportation planning for the county Environmental 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our current effort is only addressing the alignment (of the proposed road)," 
Persaud said. He added that his agency is working with the Santa Margarita Co., 
which, as part of the environmental impact report, has been asked to come up 
with a conceptual land-use plan for the Horno planning area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Horno area, a 6,000-acre expanse of rolling hills and grasslands east of 
San Juan Capistrano, has been used during the past 100 years for cattle grazing 
and barley growing. It is near the 5,000-acre Rancho Santa Margarita community, 
also owned by the development company. Company officials anticipate that 40,000 
people will live in the Horno area when development is completed by the turn of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita Co. officials would say only that the alternative road project 
is not their undertaking and that they are only working on the conceptual 
land-use plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always said that we intend to develop the land south of Rancho Santa 
Margarita in a master-planned concept," said company spokeswoman Diane Gaynor. 
</P>
<P>
 But a free road could draw traffic away from the toll road, reducing toll 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for the Transportation Corridor Agencies, which is overseeing the 
tollway construction, said they would not speculate on the matter until the 
county's environmental impact report is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, said TCA's spokeswoman Lisa Telles, two roads "will obviously be 
needed there eventually." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she said, both the Antonio Parkway extension and the unbuilt portion 
of the Foothill corridor are contemplated in the county's Master Plan of 
Arterial Highways, which includes a study of future roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Persaud said that although no firm plans for such an alternative road are 
being considered, the county may build the road if the development plans for 
the Horno area become a reality.

TURTLE ROCK WOMAN IS FOUND SLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 46-year-old woman was discovered by her husband slain in their bed Thursday 
night in the exclusive Turtle Rock neighborhood, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Lea Pratt, who died between 5:30 and 11:45 p.m., may have interrupted 
a burglary in progress, police said Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Paul Pratt, last saw her alive when he left for a business 
meeting Thursday evening. There were no signs of forced entry in the home, but 
police said several "items of value" had been taken from the house, which is at 
the end of a cul-de-sac on Windflower next to a small park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that possibly she interrupted a crime in the home or that someone 
entered the home while she was there," Police Lt. Sam Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Pratt suffered injuries to her upper torso, but Allevato refused 
to say exactly how she died.  
</P>
<P>
 Pratt was a customer service manager for PacTel Cellular in Irvine. Company 
spokeswoman Melissa May described her as "a terrific lady and a friend to all 
of us." 
</P>
<P>
 May said some employees in Pratt's department were so distraught that they 
left work early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all so upset," she said. "It's a very difficult day around here and a 
big tragedy in all of our lives. She was a valued member of our company, an 
excellent manager and a special person. We are all just dumbfounded." 
</P>
<P>
 Her death was the fourth homicide in the city since 1990, and the crime came 
as a shock to neighbors in the normally quiet Turtle Rock neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The low crime rate is one of the reasons why we live here," said Pratt's 
next-door neighbor, Cathe Martin. "It's really bizarre, definitely a shock. It 
really makes you feel vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin and her husband, Pat, said the Pratts have no children and moved onto 
the street about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing is really crazy," Pat Martin said. "You hear about these 
things happening everywhere else in the world, but to think that it happened 
right here, you realize that the world is right outside your doorstep." 
</P>
<P>
 Police returned to the neighborhood Friday evening to look for possible 
witnesses. Many residents use the park next to the Pratt home to walk their 
dogs and jog, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects. They ask that anyone who may have any information 
about the crime contact Investigator Larry Montgomery at (714) 724-7173.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; PARK PLAYGROUNDS FILLED WITH PATIENTS; 
ASSISTANCE: INJURED PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE OR TOO AFRAID TO VISIT HOSPITALS GET 
HELP AT MAKESHIFT TREATMENT CENTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Across from the monkey bars, in a grassy corner of West Valley Park, medical 
workers set up a makeshift treatment room for quake-weary residents. 
</P>
<P>
 They come almost instantly. Mothers with their babies, teen-agers and their 
friends, students and day laborers. Many have not received medical care since 
the quake turned their world upside down -- and left them spending chilly 
nights outdoors in a crowded park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something fell on my back and it still hurts," said 19-year-old janitor 
Victor Albizures, 19, who was working at the Northridge Fashion Center during 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky. My friend lost his legs." 
</P>
<P>
 Although hospitals and shelters provide medical care, many residents camped in 
parks and in vacant lots are unable or are too fearful to venture to such 
facilities, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a frustration," she said. "If you don't tend to minor things, they 
develop into serious things." 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing of sick babies, a diabetic woman living in the park who couldn't 
find insulin, and other cases, Chick and her staff organized a team of doctors 
and nurses to treat residents at parks in the west San Fernando Valley. Using 
donated medical supplies and the barest equipment, the doctors and nurses 
listened to their stories and treated their ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days away from giving birth to her first child, Esmeralda Torres, 22, has 
spent the last four nights sleeping in Reseda Park. She has had pain in her 
abdomen, she said, and during a strong aftershock Friday she fell and hurt her 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you walk?" the doctor asked in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts a lot," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you feel your baby moving normally? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After examining Torres, the doctor bandaged her foot and ankle, assured her 
that the sprain would heal and wished her good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaning heavily on a stick, Torres walked slowly to her cousin, who was 
waiting with a baby stroller -- the closest thing they could find to a 
wheelchair. Torres sat in the stroller and her cousin wheeled her back to their 
spot in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anxiety, headaches, a lot of colds, chest discomfort -- we're seeing all 
kinds of people," said Dr. Michael Genova, a volunteer from the Northridge 
Family Practice Training Program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some really need help, some just need to be assured that they're OK," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Monday, 11-year-old Yesenia Becerra said she has been "real panicky" and 
"feeling sick." 
</P>
<P>
 "My stomach keeps on hurting every time there's an earthquake," Yesenia said 
sadly, her cheeks flushed. "I don't want to eat because I feel like throwing 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Yesenia, her sister, Maribel, 17, and the rest of the family have slept on 
couches in the back yard of their home in Reseda since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake, the seemingly endless aftershocks and night after night 
sleeping outside are starting to take a physical and emotional toll on the 
family. Maribel, a student at Reseda High School, has tried to be strong for 
her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was calming them, telling them that it was going to be OK," she said, 
holding their baby sister, Claudia, who was examined by a doctor. Maribel told 
them "that God would take care of us." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really scared for my aunt," she said. "She's pregnant and every time 
there's an earthquake, she starts crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Olga Murillo hurt her shoulder, knee and arm as she tried to escape from the 
rubble of her second-floor condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I jumped out a window," she said. "(The doctor) said I have blood on the knee 
but it's going to go away. Thank God it's not serious. I could have broken my 
legs." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at the park gave her pain medication. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have Kaiser but it's easier to come here," she said. "The other day I went 
there and I waited three hours. I came here and they saw me right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the volunteers were doctors, residents, nurses and medical assistants 
from the Northridge Family Practice Training program at Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center. Nurse practitioner Karen K. Proctor, who works with the Los 
Angeles Unified School District, had been doing paperwork since the quake 
closed the schools. But she felt the desire to do more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather be with our kids," Proctor said. "I think they need us." 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Elefante, a member of Chick's staff, even handed out lollipops to 
children who saw the doctors.  
</P>
<P>
 "Lollipops are things children find comfort in," she said. "These are such 
uncomfortable times." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they bandaged, comforted and counseled, some of the medical workers 
said their greatest contribution might have been their mere presence at the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's helping them the most is knowing that people still care," Genova said.

18-YEAR-OLD SHOT IN DRIVE-BY DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old man died Thursday night from injuries he suffered in a drive-by 
shooting that police said was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Silva Torivio of Santa Ana died at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, 
said Police Sgt. Dick Faust. Police have no suspects in the shooting, which is 
being investigated as gang-related, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torivio and a friend were walking on East Vance Street on Wednesday when a 
small truck passed them, police said. A short distance away, the truck stopped 
and a passenger got out and fired a handgun three times in the direction of 
Torivio and his friend, police said. One of the shots hit Torivio in the head.

NEWPORT BEACH PANEL DENIES PERMIT FOR TOPLESS BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Against the advice of the city's legal counsel, the Planning Commission on 
Thursday night denied a permit for what would have been the city's first 
topless bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying they believe the bar, Mermaids, would generate traffic and parking 
problems in the area southeast of John Wayne Airport, the commissioners voted 4 
to 2 against granting the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Their vote came after Assistant City Atty. Robin Flory informed the 
commissioners that the proposed bar mostly meets the requirements of the city's 
adult entertainment ordinance. The commissioners can set conditions, such as 
parking or seating spaces, that the establishment must meet, but they cannot 
outright deny the owners the right to operate, Flory said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have the discretion . . . and cannot deny the permit based upon an 
objection to the type of business," Flory said. To do so could be considered 
prior restraint and a possible violation of the owners' rights to free speech, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission vote could be moot since the courts have long decreed live 
adult entertainment is an expression protected by the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know why they did what they did -- they didn't want an adult entertainment 
business in the area," said Ronald Talmo, a Santa Ana attorney who represents 
An and Olivia Nguyen, who sought the permit for Mermaids. "But they didn't have 
any right to do it. The city attorney told them they couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Talmo, who has 21 days to appeal the Planning Commission's vote to the City 
Council, said he will do so at its Feb. 7 meeting. An Nguyen, who also owns 
Paddy Murphy's, a Santa Ana juice bar that features nude dancing, declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 As planned by the Nguyens, Mermaids would be "a classy place," Talmo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6,800-square-foot club would feature five "theater" stages. Stage 1 would 
have dancers performing to recorded or live music. Stage 2 would be a small 
movie theater. Stage 3 would have a cozy room with a fireplace, large screen TV 
and seating for either viewing sporting events or dancers. Stage 4 would have 
live bands and karaoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Stage 5 would feature two "viewing rooms," for private dancers and their 
customers. The dancer and customer in each room would be separated by a 
three-foot Plexiglas partition. The area above the glass to the ceiling is 
alarmed by a light beam mechanism that would sound if dancer and customer make 
physical contact.

MOTEL ROOMS OFFERED TO QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Motel owners in South Gate are making more than 100 rooms available free of 
charge to families left homeless by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The rooms will be available to families for up to a week, said Sam Patidar, 
treasurer of the South Gate Motel Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The group took the action after City Councilman Albert Robles got the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "If motel owners throughout the city can donate vacant rooms . . . it could go 
a long way toward solving the housing problems from the earthquake," Robles 
said. "We need to work together to get people out of their cars and parks and 
into some shelter."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA 
WATER IS BACK, SCHOOLS TO REOPEN; RECOVERY: CLASSES WILL START MONDAY AT MOST 
CAMPUSES, BUT REPAIRS COULD COST A TOTAL OF $20 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life in Santa Clarita inched closer to normal Friday, with plans being made to 
reopen most schools and water service being restored to most residents. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials in Newhall spent Friday hustling to repair broken lights, 
windows and water pipes so that classes can resume at most campuses Monday. But 
the two most damaged campuses in the William S. Hart Union High School District 
-- Hart High School and Placerita Junior High -- will remain closed until 
further notice, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake dealt serious structural blows to at least half a dozen 
buildings on the Hart campus. If they must be rebuilt, repair costs at that 
campus could reach $8 million, Supt. Walter L. Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The losses at nearby Placerita Junior High, where the parking lot pavement 
cracked and numerous light fixtures toppled to the floor, could hit $2 million, 
Swanson said. When the Hart and Placerita repair bills are added to those at 
the district's six other schools, the total could be $20 million, the 
superintendent said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday afternoon, Bill Beauer, assistant principal at Hart High, stepped 
carefully around the quake rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here 19 years," he said. "This was the worst earthquake by far." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's auditorium, built in 1945, was sealed off because large portions 
of the ceiling had collapsed, releasing hazardous airborne asbestos particles. 
</P>
<P>
 District staff members were worried how the repairs could be financed. "I 
think everybody is concerned, knowing that money for schools is so scarce to 
begin with," said Dick Louis, athletic director at Hart High. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson said the district would have to seek federal disaster funds or 
consider other revenue sources. 
</P>
<P>
 At Placerita Junior High, the buildings were found to be structurally sound, 
but electrical and water pipe repairs were expected to be costly. Although 
Swanson said Placerita probably could be ready for students to return Monday, 
its reopening was delayed because it still had no natural gas service by Friday 
afternoon, leaving the campus without heat and hot water. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the reopening of Hart High School would have to wait until engineers 
could do a further review of the school's original blueprints. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key problems at Hart, he said, was structural damage to a building 
containing 22 classrooms for 600 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's other high schools, Canyon and Saugus, will be open Monday and 
Tuesday on a reduced schedule of 8 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. Arroyo Seco and Sierra 
Vista junior high schools will be open Monday and Tuesday from 8 a.m. to noon. 
Two alternative campuses, The Learning Post and Bowman High School will return 
to regular schedules Monday, but all Golden Oak Adult School programs will be 
canceled until further notice, district officials said. Regular school district 
and city transportation will be available on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 While school officials were busy grappling with damaged buildings, a small 
tent city was formed in Newhall Memorial Park by residents who were either 
unable or too afraid to return to their earthquake-damaged homes. On the park 
grounds were about 20 makeshift tents and shelters, many constructed of 
cardboard boxes, bedsheets and large plastic tarps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel safer out here," said Kira Ortiz, 17, as she prepared food on a 
barbecue. Nearby was Rosa Mendez and her 2-year-old daughter, Jessica, who had 
been sleeping in Mendez's car for the past three nights. "The apartment I'm in 
almost fell in," she said. "I can't go back inside. I'm scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the joint state-federal disaster assistance center that opened 
Thursday afternoon in Canyon Country continued to do brisk business Friday. 
Relief officials there said more than 300 people had submitted relief 
applications in its first two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Although residents commended federal officials for providing food and water to 
those waiting in line Friday -- something that had not been done Thursday -- 
they also complained that people with scheduled appointments to submit relief 
applications were being forced to wait nearly two hours beyond their scheduled 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our time was 3 to 4 p.m.," said Mark Papp, 32, of Canyon Country, as he stood 
in line at 4:45 p.m. Friday, waiting for his appointment. "And we're still not 
there yet." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kevin and Jill Rollins, a Newhall couple who had just finished their 
appointment, said the process went very smoothly. "It's very organized," said 
Jill Rollins. To shorten the delays, federal officials said they switched 
Friday to a less time-consuming application procedure for residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhaustion was also setting in for the officers stationed at the Santa Clarita 
Valley Sheriff's Station, who will be given their first day off since Monday's 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Robert Elson said the 130 officers based at the station have been working 
12-hour shifts without a day off since the earthquake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to give people some time off because the fatigue is building to the 
point people are having trouble functioning," Elson said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 120 officers were sent to the area Friday from other stations throughout 
the county to provide additional patrol support. Elson said the officers will 
work traffic control, security and street patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 They will also serve as a tactical response force for north Los Angeles County 
if another disaster strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who had been without water also got some better news. Valencia Water 
Co. has been able to restore service to nearly all of its customers in Valencia 
and Saugus. Stevenson Ranch and Sunset Pointe, located west of the Golden State 
Freeway, were still without water, although company officials said it will be 
on within the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall County Water District, serving 6,700 people in the Newhall area, 
reported that "99.9%" of its customers have water. Only a trailer park and a 
dozen homes remain without water, said Jean DiAngelous, assistant general 
manager, noting that potable water is being provided to them. All of the 
company's customers should have water by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all the 19,000 households and businesses served by Santa Clarita 
Water Co. again have water service, staff engineer Dennis Rolfe said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita spokeswoman Gail Foy said earthquake-related damage to the city 
is estimated at $125 million, a figure that doesn't include losses at schools, 
libraries and the local water treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Friday, 12 buildings in the city were designated as uninhabitable. The 
condemned structures include four single-family houses, two multifamily homes, 
five commercial buildings and one church. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty residential and commercial buildings have been assigned limited access, 
Foy said, noting that with extensive repairs the structures can be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Electricity is on for just about everybody, gas is getting on for just 
everybody and we're still on a boil-water order," Foy said.

THOMAS RITES BRING CALL FOR PEACE; FUNERAL: TRUCE MAKER IS MOURNED BY GANG 
MEMBERS, POLITICIANS AND RESIDENTS OF THE HOUSING PROJECT WHERE HE WAS SLAIN. 
SPEAKERS REMEMBER HIM AS A LEADER AND A ROLE MODEL. 
</P>

 The funeral of Tyrone Thomas, a leading engineer of a gang truce in Watts and 
South-Central Los Angeles who was gunned down at a housing project last week, 
brought out 300 mourners Friday -- and renewed calls for gang peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each and every one of us has to stand up and make sure that our brothers stop 
taking each other down," the Rev. Carl Washington told the crowd that spilled 
out of Angelus Funeral Home on Crenshaw Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington and several other speakers hailed Thomas, known as Tony Bogard in 
his neighborhood, as a leader and role model who stuck his neck out to keep the 
truce going. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to rise to the occasion to keep this truce alive," Washington said as 
several women slumped in their seats weeping while men, their eyes masked by 
dark glasses, wiped away tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who walked a fine line between peacemaker and being a product of years 
of gangbanging, was killed during a shootout Jan. 14 at the Imperial Courts 
housing project. Attending the funeral were gang members from throughout 
South-Central Los Angeles, community activists from as far away as Stockton, 
politicians and residents from three Watts housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard when you're involved in gangs and change to the other side. It's 
twice as hard for peace because some of your own brothers turn on you," rap 
music star Ice-T said as he tried to contain his sobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat who represents the area, said Thomas' death 
should motivate others to put an end to such gatherings in funeral homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police have made one arrest -- Rodney Compton, 20, a reputed 
member of the PJ Watts Crips -- and are looking for another suspect. But the 
details of the shooting remain unclear. Police say they have had a hard time 
getting information from Imperial Courts residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's funeral produced calls for more assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing like this has happened in the community before," said Perry Crouch of 
Good News, an organization devoted to gang prevention. "People came from 
outside and did shooting, but no one inside (Imperial Courts) ever killed 
anybody else there." 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch said he expects more people from the housing projects to come forward 
with information now that an arrest has been made and the funeral has passed.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; METROLINK RIDERSHIP CONTINUES TO SWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Years of promotional campaigns failed to accomplish what 10 shaking seconds 
did: Commuters from the north county are getting out of their cars by the 
thousands and using public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink, the train service that carries commuters to destinations throughout 
the Southland, has had its ridership swell since the 6.6 Northridge earthquake 
Monday that caused the collapse of portions of several major freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Most dramatic has been the surge of Metrolink use from the Santa Clarita 
station. Commuters from the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys, who are without 
direct freeway access to the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles, are packing 
Metrolink trains. Trains out of the Santa Clarita station have gone from 
carrying a mere 1,000 people in and out of that valley each weekday to an 
expected 13,000 Friday, and the numbers continue to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Monday, Metrolink for the first time will extend its service into 
the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Two trains each morning will stop in Lancaster and Palmdale, and two will 
return each evening. The trains will stop in Santa Clarita, Burbank and 
Glendale on their way to Union Station in L. A. 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly passes will sell for $208. A 10-trip ticket will cost $65. Metrolink 
spokesman Brendan Shepherd said February passes will also be good for the 
balance of January and -- pending Metropolitan Transit Authority board approval 
Jan. 26 -- will also be valid through March. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets will be available for sale today and Sunday from 1 to 6 p.m. at the 
Palmdale Cultural Center, 704 E. Palmdale Blvd. In Lancaster, train tickets can 
be purchased today and Sunday from noon to 6 p.m. at an office south of 
Lancaster Boulevard near the railroad tracks at 416 W. Lumber St., Unit C. 
Passes may also be purchased weekdays from Metrolink staff members from 3:30 
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. at the stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The 84-mile train ride from Lancaster to Union Station is expected to take two 
hours and 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The trains that will begin serving the Antelope Valley on Monday will also 
stop in Santa Clarita, bolstering service there. Metrolink is also adding a 
midmorning train from Santa Clarita and a midmorning and evening train to Santa 
Clarita from downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unknown how long the Metrolink service will continue to the Antelope 
Valley, but there are plans to add two more stops between the Antelope and 
Santa Clarita valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Transit Authority will continue its bus service to the 
Santa Clarita Metrolink station only through Tuesday. On Wednesday, AVTA will 
resume, for the first time since the quake, bus service to downtown Los 
Angeles. Now Boarding in the Antelope Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink will begin service from the Antelope Valley on Monday. These new 
stops, and departure times, will continue at least through Feb. 4: Southbound

WOMAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN DRUNKEN SHOOTING SPREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 45-year-old woman accused of going on a drunken shooting spree in Thousand 
Oaks pleaded not guilty Friday, but her attorney said the plea may later be 
amended to say the woman was insane at the time of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Ann Quinn, who has worked as a messenger service saleswoman, now 
faces 19 criminal charges, including shooting at inhabited dwellings, shooting 
at cars and drunk driving. She was arrested moments after allegedly firing a 
rifle at Los Robles Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn's attorney, Jenny Scovis of Thousand Oaks, told Ventura County Superior 
Court Judge Lawrence Storch that her client already has been examined by a 
psychologist and a psychiatrist and is attending therapy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scovis said she wanted to have Quinn examined by an additional forensic 
psychiatrist before entering a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Scovis called Quinn's life a "horror story" and said a 
history of abuse by family members contributed to her mental state the night of 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her life just went into a crisis. It just came tumbling down," Scovis said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Roger A. Inman said he did not believe that Quinn was 
legally insane the night of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was upset. She had some problems in her life, obviously," Inman said. But 
he added: "Legal insanity is different from being mentally disturbed." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a sheriff's deputy said he witnessed Quinn shooting at the hospital, 
Scovis said she did not believe all the shots were fired by her client. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Christmastime. People get so depressed," the attorney said. "I don't 
think she was the only person out there going nuts that night." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn, who is free on $50,000 bail, is scheduled to appear for a pretrial 
hearing March 4 in Ventura County Superior Court. Her trial is scheduled to 
start March 14.

4 ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF WHITTIER MAN; CRIME: THE SUSPECTS, ALLEGEDLY CONNECTED 
TO AN OXNARD GANG, ARE ACCUSED IN A DECEMBER SHOOTING AT A VENTURA MOTEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ventura police on Friday arrested three men and a woman in connection with the 
fatal shooting of a 21-year-old Whittier man at a Ventura motel last month, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the four suspects -- all alleged members or associates of the same 
Oxnard gang -- were at the Motel 6 on Johnson Drive in Ventura the night Paul 
Martinez was gunned down on the second-story balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all believed to have been acting in concert at the time of the 
shooting," Ventura Police Lt. Steve Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests came after more than 150 police officers swooped down on 13 homes 
in Oxnard and Port Hueneme before dawn Friday, looking for evidence in the Dec. 
18 killing. Police executed search warrants at a dozen of the homes and 
conducted a probation search at one other starting at 4:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Police confiscated several firearms and clubs and impounded two vehicles 
believed to have been at the scene of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman said he did not know whether detectives found the gun used to kill 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 After hours of questioning more than a half dozen suspects, police arrested 
Shaun Bolo, 20, and his brother, Willard, 23, both of Oxnard and Steven 
Hidalgo, 20, and Naomi Honohan, 19, both of Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators booked all four into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of murder. 
They were being held late Friday in lieu of $250,000 bail. They are scheduled 
to appear in Ventura County Municipal Court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A 23-year-old Oxnard man also was arrested on outstanding warrants, and a 
16-year-old male was taken to Juvenile Hall on suspicion of possessing a stolen 
handgun and methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Bob Anderson, who is in charge of the case, could not be reached for 
comment Friday. But earlier, he described the killing as an apparently random 
act of violence involving gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's apparent a gun was pulled out at a moment's notice, totally unplanned," 
he said. "One group of people from one city decided to shoot at people from 
another city." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic motive behind this crime was that there was someone at the hotel 
from Los Angeles and someone from Oxnard didn't like it," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since beginning their investigation, detectives have focused on a group of 
people from Oxnard who were having a party in a room at the motel shortly 
before the shooting. Police have said they do not believe Martinez knew any of 
the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The night of the shooting, Martinez had driven to Santa Paula with a friend, 
Gerald Razo, to meet one of Razo's army buddies. But when they got to Santa 
Paula, someone suggested the party move to the Motel 6 on Johnson Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez worked as a shoe salesman and had a 2-week-old daughter when he was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just wanted to have a better life for his girlfriend and his baby," Razo 
said.

 A few hours after the pre-dawn temblor struck the San Fernando Valley on 
Monday, Joanne and Jim Dodds opened the front doors of St. James Presbyterian 
Church in Tarzana and were relieved when they saw only dust in the entryway. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Jim Dodds opened the doors to the sanctuary, which can accommodate 800 
people, he warned his wife, who is the church's administrator, "You don't want 
to see this." 
</P>
<P>
 The entire ceiling, about three stories high, had come crashing down. From the 
balcony to the pulpit, broken pews were covered in a tangled collage of 
plaster, 2-by-4s and the shattered ceiling lights. Walls on both sides have 
visible cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 With damage estimated at more than $1.5 million, Senior Pastor Ken Baker and 
other church officials fear the Ventura Boulevard church is a total loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar appraisals were being made at houses of worship around the city this 
week in the wake of the magnitude 6.6 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crosses were knocked loose, Jewish Torah scrolls tumbled out of their 
enclosures and innumerable stained-glass windows blew out or cracked. Some 
congregations were shifting their worship services this weekend to other 
buildings -- even outdoors, if weather permits. Others are roping off unsafe 
areas of sanctuaries and hallways. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wat Thai Buddhist Temple in North Hollywood, altar items were toppled, 
although the giant statue of Buddha remained unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many places of worship have placed yellow tape around sections of their 
buildings where concrete chunks have fallen or broken windows loom high above. 
</P>
<P>
 But yellow tape completely surrounded Emmanuel Lutheran Church in North 
Hollywood, according to Barbara Price of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in 
America office in Los Angeles. In addition to a list of affected church 
buildings, the Lutherans "have two pastors who have been sleeping outside 
because their homes were not inhabitable," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some churches, such as St. John Baptist de la Salle in Granada Hills, will 
still celebrate Masses in their main sanctuary this weekend, but others, such 
as Mandarin Baptist Church near Cal State Northridge, North Hollywood 
Presbyterian Church and St. John Eudes Catholic Church of Chatsworth, are 
moving services to another hall at least for this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Clarita, a large Mormon church suffered structural damage. Many Santa 
Monica churches were hard hit. American Baptist officials said they have 
received damage reports from as far away as Ebenezer Baptist Church in 
Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the central region of Los Angeles, spires were damaged at the 
much-photographed First Congregational Church and at First Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Two prominent black churches in Los Angeles also suffered serious damage. The 
1,200-member University Seventh-day Adventist Church near USC was forced to 
relocate today's services from its 74-year-old building to the Los Angeles 
Adventist Academy in Willowbrook. Advent Episcopal Church, where the Rev. Lewis 
Bohler is rector, had just finished a $75,000 retrofitting of its West Adams 
Boulevard structure when this week's quake knocked down its front facade and 
damaged the altar area. 
</P>
<P>
 Most congregations were awaiting assessments from inspectors. Bishop Roy Sano 
of the United Methodist Church said that six to 10 congregations in the Los 
Angeles area are in that situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth United Methodist Church is definitely not in good shape, said 
trustee Bob Knapp, who was helping move undamaged items out of the sanctuary 
early this week.

<P>
 "The whole building apparently shifted three inches to the east, and the 
lateral timber is split," Knapp said, pointing to the roof line near the 
shattered glass windows behind the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
 Synagogues in all parts of the Valley were hit.  
</P>
<P>
 At Valley Beth Shalom in Encino, Friday night services were shifted to the 
synagogue's newer but smaller social hall. "A lot of ceiling came down in the 
older, main sanctuary," said Rabbi Jerry Danzig, the synagogue administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of Judaism incurred as much as $2 million in damage, including 
the destruction of ancient Bibles and other Jewish books. The acoustic ceiling 
of the main auditorium collapsed, said Mimi Sells, public affairs director at 
the campus off Mulholland Drive. The school will reopen on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some churches close to the epicenter did remarkably well. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old sanctuary of Northridge United Methodist Church had no broken 
windows despite its location two blocks from the tragic collapse of the 
Northridge Meadows apartment building, where 16 people were killed. "We are 
feeling very happy that we are in good structural shape," Senior Pastor David 
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the sanctuary was flooded Tuesday night after water service was 
restored because of a broken sprinkler line. Nevertheless, services will be 
held in the sanctuary as usual Sunday morning, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic San Fernando Mission suffered very little damage, a 
representative said. The old church had been reconstructed after the 1971 
Sylmar earthquake and withstood the shaking so well this time that funerals 
were held there this week and weekend weddings were not canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Hillcrest Christian Church in Granada Hills suffered no serious 
damage. Like many congregations, it is turning its efforts to helping members 
and other residents cope with post-earthquake needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Jess Moody said his Shepherd of Hills Church in Porter Ranch was 
setting up cleanup teams and asking artisans in its congregation to do their 
work for 10% less than they normally charge. The church also played host to a 
Southern Baptist relief team to feed people and provide cots. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Moody said that Shepherd of the Hills has breaks in its 
front stained-glass window, the apex of its roof and in other areas -- damage 
that could cost $200,000 to $1 million to repair, depending on whether any 
structural damage is indicated by inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the one good turn deserves another department: St. Stephen's Presbyterian 
Church of Chatsworth had nearly a dozen homeless people sleeping in the main 
sanctuary when the quake struck Monday morning. They were inside portable 
tents, provided as part of the Valley Interfaith Council's program to play host 
to homeless people at different congregations for two weeks at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kitchen was a mess, and they did a wonderful service in helping with the 
cleanup," church member Bill Newbold said.

CENTER MUST PAY $5.7 MILLION OVER ABUSE BY PRIEST IT TREATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the northern Minnesota town of Bemidji, where Mark Smith grew up, it was an 
article of faith: You obeyed your parish priest. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith did. And when he was 9, he says, the Father James Porter molested him. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 24 years after the encounter that devastated his faith and shadowed his 
life, Smith and other victims of the former priest are receiving compensation 
from an unusual and controversial source -- a center that counseled Porter 
before the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Servants of the Paraclete Treatment Center in Jemez Springs, N.M., agreed 
to pay nearly $5.7 million to 21 Minnesotans who said Porter sexually abused 
them while a Roman Catholic priest at the Bemidji parish in 1969 and 1970, 
after he had spent time at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement raises a question that worries some who treat sex offenders: 
Should treatment centers be held responsible when treatment does not work? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a considerable threat to treatment programs," said Gerry Kaplan, 
director of Alpha Human Services in Minneapolis, which treated Porter decades 
later. "Treatment programs cannot be responsible for the actions of criminals. 
They're responsible for their own behavior. We're not." 
</P>
<P>
 But victims believe the system put a pedophile back in a parish and bears part 
of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one way to hold them accountable," said Smith, who lives in the Twin 
Cities area. "I feel they have to make restitution for what they did, for the 
suffering we've been put through." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement approved in November, the New Mexico center admitted no 
wrongdoing. Most of the money, $5.3 million, would come from three insurance 
companies if they agree to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were negligent in the way they treated him, they were negligent in the 
way they released him and they were negligent in suggesting that he was 
anything less than totally unfit for the priesthood," said Jeffrey Anderson, 
attorney for the 21 victims involved in the settlement. "They implied that he 
had been cured." 
</P>
<P>
 An important distinction is that from 1947 to 1977 the New Mexico facility was 
not a treatment center but a place for monastic religious retreats, said Father 
Liam Hoare, president of the Servants of the Paraclete congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never purported to be a treatment center," Hoare said. Instead, priests 
and brothers spent time in private prayer, at Mass or in one-on-one sessions 
with a spiritual adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter later participated in a 13-week program at Alpha Human Services for 
people who deny or greatly minimize their offenses, as part of a 1992 
conviction for molesting a baby-sitter in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 He is serving an 18-year prison term in Massachusetts after pleading guilty to 
41 counts of sexual abuse while a priest there in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpha Human Services has been sued only once in 20 years and that case was 
dismissed, Kaplan said. But he believes suits such as the one against Paraclete 
will make it harder to get insurance and could chill efforts to treat sex 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our society, we always want to blame somebody when something goes wrong. 
And it's wrong to blame someone other than the perpetrator," Kaplan said. 
"Typically there is someone other than the perpetrator with deeper pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt it will spur similar lawsuits," said Cassandra Thomas, 
president of the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault. "I don't know of 
one treatment plan other than death where they can promise that recidivism will 
not occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said she is concerned about lawsuits -- or the fear of them -- driving 
treatment centers out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is, these people are getting out (of jail)," she said. "If we 
don't come up with a treatment, we haven't done anything but put them into an 
environment where they get more angry and visualize more offenses." 
</P>
<P>
 The suits also could drive the Archdiocese of Santa Fe to bankruptcy. In 
November, the archdiocese asked parishes for cash to help fight dozens of 
sex-abuse lawsuits that could cost up to $50 million. Many priests or former 
priests named in the lawsuits attended the Servants of the Paraclete center. 
</P>
<P>
 People in the field say that treatment cannot "cure" criminal behavior, but 
that if offenders want to change, counseling may help control or redirect their 
urges. That philosophy has changed considerably since Porter was counseled by 
the New Mexico center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying that in any way it was justifiable," Kaplan said. "But we 
constantly evaluate their misdeeds by contemporary standards rather than by the 
standards of how these situations were handled 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoare said the New Mexico center hired trained therapists and counselors after 
realizing the problem was not easily solved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The term 'Pray and it will go away' just doesn't fit anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith, one of the victims, said the center still should have known Porter 
would abuse again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't buy the excuse that 'We didn't know,' " he said. "It just doesn't 
wash. . . . You don't put an alcoholic back behind the bar. You don't put a 
pedophile back in a parish."

JURY URGES LIFE SENTENCE IN '91 KILLING; COURTS: JAMES MARTIN, FORMERLY OF 
VENTURA, WAS CONVICTED OF KILLING A CANADIAN TOURIST. A DEATH PENALTY BID IS 
REJECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury in Santa Barbara has recommended that a former Ventura man should spend 
the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole for the 
execution-style murder of a Canadian tourist two years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had argued that James Lindsey Martin, 40, should receive the death 
penalty for the October, 1991, murder of Evelyn Marie Hendrix, 68, of Qualicum 
Beach, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 But after deliberating for 10 days in the penalty phase of Martin's trial, a 
Santa Barbara County Superior Court jury on Tuesday decided that Martin should 
instead be sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," said Santa Barbara County Deputy Dist. Atty. Hilary Dozer, 
who tried the case. "The defense presented evidence that the defendant had a 
somewhat abusive childhood. . . . But my feeling is that there are a lot of 
people who have had difficult childhoods that don't go around killing people." 
</P>
<P>
 While growing up, Martin lived in Ventura, Santa Paula and Bakersfield, the 
prosecutor said. He has spent most of the past 20 years in state prison and was 
released early from an Oklahoma prison less than six months before he killed 
Hendrix. In prison, he was trained as a motor-home mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin kidnaped Hendrix from mid-town Ventura and forced her to drive her 
motor home to a parking lot near the Ventura Pier. There, he placed a towel 
over the woman's head and shot her, Dozer said. The woman's body was found 
dumped off Casitas Pass Road near Carpinteria in Santa Barbara County. As a 
result, his trial was held in that county. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendrix was on her way to Los Angeles to put flowers on her mother's grave and 
visit an old friend when she was abducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a week after the killing, Martin was suspected of shooting Lloyd 
Johnson of Oxnard inside Johnson's motor home at the San Buenaventura State 
Beach in the same manner. Johnson survived because the bullet fired at his head 
was made in the 1970s and the gunpowder had deteriorated, Dozer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin is also suspected of killing a 91-year-old man while burglarizing his 
house in Las Vegas about six weeks after the Johnson shooting. Martin was 
arrested after U.S. Border Patrol agents in New Mexico stopped him and a 
computer record check showed he was wanted on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 He has not been charged in either of those cases, pending the outcome of the 
murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin is scheduled to be sentenced on Tuesday.

BIAS AGAINST U.S. MUSLIMS CITED IN REPORT TO CIVIL RIGHTS PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Muslims in the United States face widespread discrimination in the workplace 
and in society at large, a top Islamic scholar has told the U.S. Commission on 
Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Azizah Al-Hibri, a professor of law at the University of Richmond in Virginia, 
told the rights panel at a Jan. 14 hearing that Muslims in the United States 
"have not had their own voice" and are defined for the general population by 
non-Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Al-Hibri, a founder of the Muslim American Bar Assn. who has handled numerous 
anti-bias cases, said bigotry against Muslims -- especially women -- is 
widespread in the corporate world, in academia and in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing poll results, Al-Hibri said Islam "is the most negatively viewed 
religion in America" and that American Muslims have "suffered a great deal in 
terms of respect." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Muslim women who follow the tradition of covering their heads in 
public often encounter discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either you're not hired," she said, "or, if you are, you're put in the back 
room" out of public sight and denied promotions and advancements. 
</P>
<P>
 Al-Hibri made her comments as part of a panel briefing the eight-member civil 
rights commission called to examine current issues on religious civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal anti-bias laws prohibit discrimination in employment, schooling and a 
wide variety of other federally funded programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also testifying were the Rev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans 
United for Separation of Church and State; Meyer Eisenberg, chairman of the 
national civil rights committee of the Anti-Defamation League; William Scott 
Green, a professor of Judaic studies at the University of Rochester, and the 
Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, president of the Institute on Religion and Public 
Life in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn told the commission that, despite the claims of some ultraconservatives, 
the Christian religion "is alive and well in America" and that, although there 
are incidents involving bias, "there is no campaign of religious bigotry" 
against Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who complain of intolerance or bigotry by the government against 
Christianity, he said, "are complaining about the failure of the government to 
help them promote their causes." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Lynn said, there was bias against minority religions such as 
Islam and Hinduism and some sectarian minorities within Christianity, such as 
the Amish. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenberg warned that religion-based hate crimes appear to be on the rise and 
that "early indications" from the ADL's annual audit of hate crimes against 
Jews and Jewish institutions "show that the numbers are up and a disturbing 
trend continues."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two UC Santa Barbara religious studies professors have unveiled the first 
three volumes of a nine-book series intended to trace the evolution of 
California's diverse religious communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip E. Hammond and Ninian Smart, the co-editors of "Religious Contours of 
California," say the state's varied religious traditions are a microcosm of the 
world's religions and ethnic groups. "Virtually every religious tradition known 
is contained within the borders of the state," Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond said that the first volume, "Californian Catholicism," describes the 
growth of Catholicism in the state from its historical roots in Spain through 
the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th Century and, more recently, the folk 
Catholicism of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The second volume, "Pilgrim Progression: The Protestant Experience in 
California," is an account of the unprecedented mixture of Protestant Christian 
groups that entered the state during the Gold Rush, he stated. 
</P>
<P>
 The third volume, "Competing Visions of Paradise: The California Experience of 
19th Century American Sectarianism," details the rise of such "made-in-America" 
religions as Mormonism, Christian Science, New Thought and Pentecostalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth volume, "Diasporas in a Golden Land: The Judaisms of California," 
will be available this spring, followed by books on Native American, East Asian 
and South Asian religions, Islam and new religious movements, Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Royalties from the sales will go to UC Santa Barbara's Center for the Study of 
Religion to fund the writing of the remaining five books. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond, who conceived the series, emphasized that it is important to study 
religions because of their enormous influence on people around the world. "We 
have found that knowledge about religions inspires respect and defuses cultural 
animosities among groups," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart agreed, pointing out that California has adopted a new framework for 
social studies and history instruction in public elementary and secondary 
schools that includes the study of religions. "Knowledge of religions creates 
an atmosphere of tolerance, while ignorance fosters prejudice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The softcover books, published by Fithian Press of Santa Barbara, are 
available at bookstores and libraries throughout the state. For information, 
contact the Center for the Study of Religion, Department of Religious Studies, 
UC Santa Barbara, 93106. (805) 893-3564.

A COMMITTED PERFECTIONIST FINDS HER FLAW; RELIGION: FORMER CABINET MEMBER 
ELIZABETH DOLE FELT A VOID IN HER HIGH-PROFILE LIFE UNTIL SHE TOOK A JOURNEY OF 
SPIRITUAL RENEWAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elizabeth Dole was cited in a 1988 Gallup poll as one of the 10 most admired 
women in the world. But the lady who combined Harvard Law School brains, 
Southern grace and a perfectionist passion for public service says her life was 
once missing something essential -- spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was blessed with a beautiful marriage and a challenging career," Dole 
regularly tells breakfast prayer groups across the country. "Gradually, over 
many years, I realized what was missing. My life was threatened with spiritual 
starvation." Dole said she realized her public service commitment had crowded 
out the spiritual lessons she learned in Salisbury, N.C., at her grandmother's 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole began her journey to spiritual renewal by meeting with a group of Senate 
wives for weekly Bible study, discussion and prayer. "I had built up my little 
self-sufficient world," Dole recalled in an interview at the headquarters of 
the American Red Cross, where she has served as president since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had God neatly compartmentalized, crammed into a crowded file drawer of my 
life, somewhere between Gardening and Government." 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday-night Bible studies, Dole said, she shared feelings with the group 
that she never would have expressed to her White House colleagues during her 
years as transportation secretary in the Reagan Administration and secretary of 
labor under George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 In this safe confine, Dole came face-to-face with her perfectionist tendencies 
and compulsion to constantly please. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said she learned that real inner strength comes from a dependent 
relationship with Jesus Christ, not from independence and self-reliance. 
Although she encourages young people to strive for excellence, which she 
believes is a Christian virtue, she cautioned: "I think there is a point of 
diminishing returns." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the greatest public service initiatives cannot meet one's deepest needs, 
she feels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christianity is more than faith, more than believing, more than trying to 
have a mission field," said Dole, the wife of Robert Dole, the powerful Senate 
minority leader. "The essence of it is having that personal relationship with 
the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole spends at least 30 minutes a day in Bible study and prayer, a time of 
spiritual renewal that gives her the energy and passion to sustain a schedule 
she says is sometimes a blur. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday has become sacrosanct in the Dole household as a time to recharge the 
batteries -- physical, emotional and spiritual. It's a time for church, friends 
and no appointments, except for an occasional appearance on a Sunday-morning 
news show. 
</P>
<P>
 "D.C.'s power couple" is how some describe the Doles. But their private life 
together belies the powerbroker image. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not on the social circuit," Dole said. "We enjoy simple things like the 
treadmill, watching old movies and fixing dinner."  
</P>
<P>
 The Doles have worked together on projects to help inner-city children, the 
homeless and senior citizens, and with the Dole Foundation, which was 
established by the senator to aid disabled people.

PENTECOSTAL FELLOWSHIP TO FORM RACIALLY MIXED ORGANIZATION; RELIGION: COALITION 
WOULD END LONGSTANDING DIVISION. IT WILL INCLUDE PREDOMINANTLY BLACK CHURCH OF 
GOD IN CHRIST AND EXCEED 10 MILLION MEMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One of the last national church associations of overwhelmingly white 
denominations, the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America, plans to disband 
and form a more racially mixed body. 
</P>
<P>
 The new umbrella organization for as many as 25 denominations would end a 
longstanding religious division in a group that began, ironically, as an 
interracial movement in Los Angeles in 1906. The proposed fellowship would have 
a constituency exceeding 10 million members, including the largest of them all, 
the predominantly black Church of God in Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 Once on the extreme margins of Christianity because of its humble 
socioeconomic origins and its exuberant beliefs in healing and supernatural 
events, Pentecostalism today boasts of mega-churches and large television 
ministries, as well as its share of controversies. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth has attracted political attention. It was at a national Church of 
God in Christ convention in Memphis, Tenn., on Nov. 14 that President Clinton 
described America's "great crisis of the spirit" in a widely reported 
sermon-speech. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force of 40 white and black church leaders laid plans this month in 
Memphis to reshape the fellowship as early as the next convention in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are moving rapidly with nothing negative in the way," said Pentecostal 
Holiness Bishop B.E. Underwood of Oklahoma City, the fellowship chairman who 
proposed the change. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fellowship's 21 denominations have some black members in their 
congregations -- just as the Church of God in Christ has a small minority of 
white members. But black denominational leaders were uninterested in joining 
the fellowship as it is constituted. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual move to disband gained emotional impetus in October at the 
fellowship's convention in Atlanta when Pastor Jack Hayford of Van Nuys' Church 
on the Way, speaking on behalf of white Pentecostalists to the many black 
churchmen who were convention guests, apologized for "decades of prejudice and 
misunderstanding" and embraced the president of a leading black Pentecostal 
seminary. Hayford also took part in this month's task force meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church historically has reflected or reinforced society's divisions," 
said Hayford, a leader in conservative Christian circles. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's a happy fact that millions of responsible, repentant, spirit-filled 
believers are . . . seeking a full recovery from the crippling impact and 
spiritual embarrassment of that past divisiveness," Hayford wrote in a Jan. 16 
bulletin for his church's 8,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fellowship, like the one scheduled for dismantling, would be a 
volunteer association of like-minded believers that has no authority over 
member denominations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the opportunity to "rub shoulders and talk" with culturally conservative 
white denominations such as the 2.2-million-member Assemblies of God will 
"automatically make everyone concerned about social issues," Bishop Gilbert 
Patterson of Memphis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we face the 21st Century, I believe the impossible task of bringing blacks 
and whites together is about to take place," said the Church of God in Christ 
bishop who will host the October meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentecostalism as a full-fledged movement began in Los Angeles with the 
1906-09 Azusa Street Mission as a racially mixed revival by a black preacher, 
the Rev. William Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
 After a black-white split in 1914, denominations developed along racial lines 
and mostly in rural and poor urban locales. The Pentecostal Fellowship of North 
America was formed in 1948 but black churches were not invited to join. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentecostalism has been shunned by many mainstream churches that claimed that 
speaking in unknown tongues and other claims related to being "filled with the 
Holy Spirit" created divisions among Christians. The most animated churches 
were often derisively called "holy rollers." Foursquare Gospel churches begun 
in the 1920s were linked for decades with its flamboyant founder, evangelist 
Aimee Semple McPherson of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the congregations were black or white, Pentecostal churches were 
largely in rural and economically depressed urban locales and their clergy 
poorly educated. Things began to change in the 1960s when groups of Pentecostal 
believers surfaced within mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic churches. They 
and many independent congregations with Pentecostal beliefs described 
themselves as charismatic, derived from the Greek word for divine gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the theological borders between Pentecostal/charismatic churches and 
their old antagonists, evangelical churches, have frequently become blurred as 
both sides focused more on common beliefs and their mutual opposition to 
abortion, pornography and gay and lesbian rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentecostal/charismatic ranks include scandal-stained televangelists Jim 
Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart as well as religious television network chiefs Pat 
Robertson in Virginia Beach, Va., and Paul Crouch in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentecostalism also includes well-regarded clergy such as Los Angeles Bishop 
Charles Blake, who serves as pastor of the nearly 11,000-member West Angeles 
Church of God in Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake was cautiously optimistic about the pending change in the Pentecostal 
Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because black churches are primarily in urban centers and white churches are 
mostly in the suburbs it will not be easy for us to have intense 
collaboration," Blake said. "But breaking down the walls is altogether 
necessary and I support any sign of reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
 Blake praised the work of Hayford in facilitating fellowship locally between 
black and white pastors of various denominations, primarily through the "Love 
L.A." prayer meetings held since 1987 at Hollywood Presbyterian Church and, on 
major occasions, at the Crenshaw Christian Center in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayford said after the task force meeting last week that nothing else has a 
higher priority for him than bringing about a new fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson of the Church of God in Christ said he keeps on his office wall a 
copy of a Los Angeles Times article that ran April 18, 1906, headlined "Weird 
Babel of Tongues, New Set of Fanatics Is Breaking Loose." The article, widely 
reproduced in Pentecostal circles, described in colorful language the preaching 
of the one-eyed William Seymour and the zeal of the racially mixed 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Church of God in Christ was formed in 1907 after the Rev. C. H. Mason and 
two brethren visited the modest mission, which stood on the edge of what is now 
Little Tokyo in Los Angeles. Returning to Memphis, Mason ordained many white 
ministers in later years, but a major group of white preachers broke off in 
1914 to form the Assemblies of God. 
</P>
<P>
 "The racial barriers that were rebuilt within a decade were understandable 
given the culture then," Hayford said. "But (the original mission) was 
nonetheless a vision of what might have been all these years."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; COUNTY REJECTS $6.6-BILLION PLAN FOR QUAKE, 
ECONOMIC NEEDS; GOVERNMENT: SUPERVISORS SAY CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER'S 
PROPOSAL TO SEEK STATE AND FEDERAL AID IS TOO AMBITIOUS. THEY ASK HER TO FOCUS 
SOLELY ON DISASTER COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County supervisors on Friday rejected a $6.6-billion package of 
earthquake and economic recovery proposals, saying they feared the state 
Legislature would oppose the scope of the plan and balk at approving any money 
for earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was submitted to the board by Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed 
at a hastily called meeting late Friday to address recovery costs. County 
officials hope to devise a plan that will be used by state and federal 
officials as a blueprint for earthquake recovery and relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reed told the supervisors that the county should also prepare an 
assessment of its needs based on its long-term economic outlook, one that would 
include programs to revitalize business and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Her plan would have included $4.9 billion to revitalize local businesses, 
rebuild public housing and establish job programs; $1 billion for community 
health, mental health and social services, temporary shelter, anti-graffiti and 
homeless programs, and $700 million for public-safety services. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors, however, rejected the package -- and the $6.6-billion figure -- 
as too ambitious. Saying it might jeopardize the county's credibility, the 
board told Reed to come back with different numbers that reflect only 
earthquake damage and recovery costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to be realistic in terms of what the state can do now," said 
Supervisor Ed Edelman. "If we put in everything else we want, we weaken our 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to lose our credibility or give the impression that we are 
taking advantage of the emergency to solve our other problems," added board 
Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 An earthquake recovery plan was requested by state Sen. David A. Roberti 
(D-Van Nuys) in anticipation of a special legislative session that Gov. Pete 
Wilson is expected to call next week to address earthquake recovery issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Los 
Angeles Unified School District and the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce have 
endorsed Reed's package and pledged to lobby hard to obtain legislative 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberti, who attended the supervisors' meeting, hinted at his unease with 
the scale of the proposals at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "In reading the list, it does include an awful lot of things I happen to 
favor, but I don't think are specifically related to the disaster," Roberti 
said. "I would hope that what you are asking of the state can be pruned a 
little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 In defending the plan, Reed argued that the fate of California's economic 
recovery rests with Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greater Los Angeles area is the economic engine that will eventually 
power statewide recovery," said Reed. "I know the number . . . is more than 
expected but it is not off base." 
</P>
<P>
 The board will take up the package again next week.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; VALLEY BUSINESSES, RESIDENTS LOOKING TO 
RELOCATE IN VENTURA; SHAKEN: REALTY OFFICES REPORT MANY CALLS FROM 
QUAKE-STRICKEN AREAS IN SEARCH OF MORE STABLE GROUND. 
</P>

 San Fernando Valley residents and business owners are flooding Ventura County 
realty offices and apartment complexes, looking for safe places to live or do 
business in the wake of Monday's devastating earthquake, real estate agents 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been phenomenal," said Kelli Tardif-Arriola, administrative manager 
for the Westlake office of Bob Ely Realty, where agents have fielded 75 calls 
for residential rental properties since Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half of those calls were from Valley residents eager to get out, 
Tardif-Arriola said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are like Shelley Maine, 29, and her fiance, Ted Osier, 30. The Northridge 
apartment dwellers had often considered leaving the north Valley, an area they 
describe as crime-ridden and graffiti-plagued. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the earthquake, we said, 'Yes, definitely, that's it,' " said Maine, 
who works as a lab technician in Calabasas. On Friday, the couple looked at 
apartments in Thousand Oaks and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Although rents are higher in Thousand Oaks, the couple said it would be worth 
the extra $200 a month to live in a building that is seismically sound and in a 
neighborhood where they would feel safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial real estate agents also report a booming rental market for office 
and manufacturing space. Like residential agents, they say the bulk of the 
interest is concentrated in Westlake, Thousand Oaks and Newbury Park, with a 
few renters looking as far as Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have beepers and car phones, and they are all beeping and ringing off 
the hook right now," said Jack Dwyer, a real estate agent with Brown-Realtors' 
Westlake commercial division in Thousand Oaks. Dwyer said he received 10 calls 
in a 24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think in 30 to 60 days, we'll have very little vacancy in the area," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial brokers say the calls range from manufacturers requesting as much 
as 120,000 square feet of manufacturing plant space, to doctors and lawyers 
looking for 1,500-square-foot offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking out one company this afternoon to look at 100,000 square feet of 
manufacturing space in Camarillo," said Rick Heath, a Grubb & Ellis broker. 
"Their building in the Valley was condemned." 
</P>
<P>
 The old City Hall on Hillcrest Drive in Thousand Oaks -- virtually untouched 
by the earthquake -- has caught the interest of at least three quake-rattled 
Valley companies looking to relocate to more solid ground, City Manager Grant 
Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brimhall said the unnamed companies have asked about moving into the building 
atop a rocky hillside overlooking The Oaks mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly flush with new clients, brokers said they are reluctant to release 
the business owners' names for fear that other brokers will start wooing their 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one big deal, however, has been made public already -- in Los Angeles 
County, just down the street from the Ventura County line. Computer giant 
Packard Bell leased 160,000 square feet of space after its Chatsworth 
headquarters received severe earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell executives have spent months looking for a suitable new 
operations site, but the quake put those plans on hold, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting next week, Packard Bell will open its headquarters and some 
production facilities at a vacant site in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents hope other businesses and residents will follow. But they 
say it is too early to tell what, if any, effect all the inquiries and rental 
showings will have on the county's real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's more smoke than fire right now," said George Hutchison, an agent 
with Brown-Realty's residential division in Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, he said, some callers might be reacting to an initial fright 
that will die down as the quake's aftershocks level off. But others might not 
have had time to call an agent and start looking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the many looking for houses and apartments spared by the tremors, some seem 
to have set their sights on Simi Valley, though parts of the city incurred 
quake damage as severe as in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people are looking for something safe, and the news didn't play up . . . 
Simi Valley as that badly damaged," said Mary Ferris, an agent at Valley Homes 
Realtors in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferris said she received 30 calls in one day, many from Valley residents 
interested in two rentals she had advertised in the paper. Ironically, both 
residences were severely damaged in the earthquake and are in no condition to 
be rented out, she said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; BOARD CANCELS MEETING ABOUT COYOTE TRAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A scheduled meeting Monday of the city's Board of Animal Regulation 
Commissioners to discuss a 7-month-old ban on coyote trapping has been canceled 
due to concern about earthquake safety at the meeting site. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting location, the Reseda Senior Citizen Center, suffered some 
earthquake damage and may not be safe for a meeting of many people, said Nancy 
Moriarty, spokeswoman for the Animal Regulation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her department had not scheduled a new date or site for the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Animal Regulation Commission voted in June to ban coyote trapping by 
city employees, residents in the West San Fernando Valley have reported an 
increase in coyote sightings, particularly in hillside neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by the increased sightings, the commission has agreed to review the 
decision to end coyote trapping.

SANTA ANA ATTORNEY CHARGED IN CUSTODY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Ana attorney is facing charges that he helped a client attempt to 
steal her two young children from her ex-husband in a small Minnesota farm 
town, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Eugene Lais, 51, a family law attorney, is accused of aiding and 
abetting a burglary attempt and attempting to deprive a father of his parental 
rights, authorities said. He is charged with five felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lais waited in a car while his client, Lisa Eileen Van Essen of Moreno Valley, 
sneaked into her ex-husband's farmhouse early Dec. 23 while he was out milking 
his cows, said Assistant County Atty. Tim Anderson in Pipestone County, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Lais denied the charges, saying he and his client were simply 
trying to enforce a court order that gave the mother custody of the two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Lais and his client each face up to 20 years in prison if convicted, Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Essen's former husband, Rodney, returned six months ago to his hometown in 
Edgerton, a small farming community of about 1,000 people in southwestern 
Minnesota. Rodney Van Essen is a dairy farmer with 300 cattle on a 300-acre 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was eventually granted custody of his 5-year-old daughter and 
3-year-old son after he and his wife separated in July and later were divorced. 
Rodney Van Essen said Friday he was shocked to see his ex-wife and her lawyer 
attempting to leave with the children that morning.  
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were traumatized," Rodney Van Essen said. "They were in their 
pajamas and running barefoot in the snow. They did not know what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Van Essen said he stopped his ex-wife from taking the children and 
called authorities, who later charged Lisa Van Essen with five felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had anything like this in this town," said Rodney Van Essen, 30. 
"But people know the problems I was having, and I've received a lot of 
prayerful support." 
</P>
<P>
 Lais said he accompanied his client to attempt to get custody of her children 
because "we have the only valid custody and visitation order" in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer said it was not unusual for him to travel out of state to help 
parents retrieve their children, noting that he recently opened an office in 
Munich, Germany, to handle child-custody cases there. 
</P>
<P>
 Lais recently sued the Center for Surrogate Parenting Inc. on behalf of Mark 
and Crispina Calvert, the Orange County couple who became embroiled in the 
county's most noted surrogacy case.

TWO WOMEN SETTLE SUITS ON HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of 10 women who filed sexual harassment lawsuits against Newport Beach, 
its former police chief and a former police officer have settled their cases 
out of court, city officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Peri Ropke, a former dispatcher who accused former Chief Arb Campbell and 
Capt. Anthony Villa of raping her after a police party in 1981, will receive 
$113,000.Ropke, who worked at the department for 12 years but has been on 
disability leave since she filed suit in October, 1992, has agreed to resign.  
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Miller, Villa's former secretary who joined the department in 1990, 
will receive $62,500 and will remain at work. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, plaintiffs and defendants have agreed not to comment on any 
aspect of the claims. But according to the official statement released by City 
Manager Kevin J. Murphy, the three defendants -- Campbell, Villa and Sgt. Trent 
Harris -- do not admit liability, but have settled with the two plaintiffs 
because of the anticipated costs of legal defense.

UC TO HIKE UNDERGRADUATE FEES $620; EDUCATION: NEW STUDENTS AT THE SYSTEM'S 
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO PAY $2,000 MORE UNDER A PLAN APPROVED BY THE 
REGENTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Undergraduate students at the University of California will have to pay $620 
more for their education beginning next fall under a plan approved by the Board 
of Regents on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The "share-the-pain" budget plan also calls for imposing a $2,000 special fee 
on new students enrolling in the professional schools of law, medicine, 
business, dentistry and veterinary medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee increases came at the same time the university announced "equity 
adjustments" for four chancellors and merit increases for UC employees making 
less than $125,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order for us to attract good leadership . . . we need to be competitive 
with other academic institutions," regents Chairman Howard Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
 UC President Jack Peltason defended the merit raises, saying that UC faculty 
members' salaries are 12% behind those of their colleagues at comparable 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that persists over a long period of time, we will lose the quality of the 
University of California. We are quite concerned about that," Peltason said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very difficult times for everyone; we recognize that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees for undergraduates have already jumped 125% in four years to the current 
average of $3,700. The increase approved Friday would bring undergraduate fees 
to about $4,300 a year. The money generated by the increase would pay for 
faculty and staff merit increases, financial aid, new buildings, equipment and 
instructional costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways, students are becoming numb to it," Scott Kamena, chairman of UC 
Berkeley's Student Senate, said of the fee increases. "We're obviously not too 
delighted about any kind of fee increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Only if the money goes toward financial aid in the form of grants and 
eligibility requirements for financial aid changes will students be able to 
bear the increases, Kamena said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peltason said the merit raises and equity adjustments were already approved in 
budget meetings last year for the 1993-1994 budget.

TWO CHARGES ADDED IN SLAYING OF POLLY KLAAS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities charged Friday that Richard Allen Davis planned to sexually 
assault 12-year-old Polly Klaas when he allegedly kidnaped her from Petaluma in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty.Greg Jacobs filed two additional counts against Davis in 
Santa Rosa Municipal Court. Davis already has been charged with murder with 
special circumstances, kidnaping, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, 
robbery, burglary and false imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 The two new counts are intent to commit a lewd and lascivious act against a 
child under the age of 14 and intent to kill a victim while lying in wait. 
Davis has claimed that he did not plan to sexually assault the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 10-minute appearance in court Friday, Davis pleaded innocent to all 
the charges. He was held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaas was found murdered near Cloverdale more than two months after being 
kidnaped from her home.

JUDGE APPROVES DRUG REHAB FOR RICK JAMES; COURTS: MUSICIAN CONVICTED OF ASSAULT 
COULD BE FREED BY SEPTEMBER. PROBE CONTINUES INTO THE CONDUCT OF HIS CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deal allowing funk singer Rick James, convicted of assaulting women and 
other offenses, to go into a drug rehabilitation center instead of prison 
received court approval Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement, which could lead James' freedom as early as September, was 
made after the Los Angeles County district attorney's office revealed that the 
conduct of his case is the subject of an internal investigation.Sources close 
to the case said the investigation focuses on allegations that a district 
attorney's investigator provided heroin to a key witness at James' trial. 
</P>
<P>
 At a brief hearing in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday, Superior Court Referee 
Laura Heimowitz accepted a psychiatric evaluation prescribing that James be 
sent to the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco, under a deal struck 
between the musician's attorney and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, James pleaded no contest to an assault charge against a 
woman at his Hollywood Hills home and was sentenced to five years and four 
months in prison. Coupled with earlier convictions for assault, false 
imprisonment and furnishing drugs, the self-proclaimed "King of Funk" could 
have been given 14 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff set aside a four-year 
prison sentence for James' girlfriend, Tanya Anne Hijazi, 23, convicted of 
taking part in some of the crimes. The judge said Hijazi, who will be 
resentenced next month, should not receive a stiffer penalty than James. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijazi and James were convicted last September of assaulting Mary Sauger, 35, 
of West Hollywood, at the St. James's Club and Hotel on Sunset Boulevard.

COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT DEFENDED; FUNDS: AN ADVISORY PANEL'S REPORT COUNTERS 
CRITICISM OF THE AGENCY. IT FINDS NO EVIDENCE OF EXTRAVAGANT SPENDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite criticism that the Ventura County Fire Department has been wasting 
precious tax dollars, a citizens advisory committee has issued a preliminary 
report saying that the department cannot be held fully accountable for how it 
spends its money. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, which will be presented to the Board of Supervisors 
at its meeting Tuesday, the county Personnel Department is responsible for 
negotiating salaries and overtime for firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Fire Department has little control over money spent in those 
areas, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, our conclusion was that the Fire Department was not totally able 
to monitor its own costs and operations because of the efforts vested in other 
departments," said F. B. Esty, committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Esty also said the panel has seen no evidence that the department has been 
"operating extravagantly," contrary to assertions by some top county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a first-class Fire Department that is well-suited for the task they 
have," Esty said. "That does not mean that there are (not) some areas that 
cannot be improved. 
</P>
<P>
 "But on the whole, we have been able to turn up nothing that indicates to us 
that the Fire Department is operating extravagantly or without due regard to 
the taxpayers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Esty said the group -- charged with recommending ways to make the 
department more efficient -- will meet several more times before issuing its 
final report in April, and could still find some problem areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This report is only a beginning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The citizens group, with about 15 active members, was formed several months 
ago by the supervisors in response to a critical audit of the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit by county Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon found that the 
department was wasting money on overtime and was top-heavy with managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon also found that, although 64% of its calls involve medical emergencies, 
most of the department's equipment is primarily for fighting fires. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that the department invest more in smaller vehicles to handle 
medical calls and reduce its use of gas-hungry firetrucks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Esty said his citizens advisory committee rejected that suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a major fire and a major earthquake," he said. "All the engines we 
had were absolutely essential to maintain the level of service the public 
expected. The Fire Department needs everything it's got." 
</P>
<P>
 While the panel's preliminary report was praised by county firefighters, one 
supervisor said she hopes the committee will do a more thorough investigation 
of the department before issuing its final recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we will see something that doesn't just agree with the Fire Department 
in every case," Supervisor Maggie Kildee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Maffei, president of the Ventura County Professional Firefighters' Assn., 
praised the preliminary findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some areas that need to be looked at as far as making us more 
efficient," he said. "But, all in all, I don't think there is 
multimillion-dollar waste going on."

EWEN'S PEN, STICK ARE EXPRESSIVE; HOCKEY: DUCKS' WING IS ARTIST AND AUTHOR OFF 
THE ICE BUT AN ENFORCER ON SKATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 These are the hands of the artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Swollen knuckles bulge above red, misshapen hands. Faint scars zag here and 
yon. Permanent calluses give testimony to the fists of a fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are wires in here," Todd Ewen says. "This knuckle here comes out. These 
are calcium deposits caused by scar tissue. This was split open." 
</P>
<P>
 Beside him rests the work of the artist -- delicate, whimsical drawings in 
vibrant colors of Whisper the Dragonfly and Hop the Frog. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewen is one of the Mighty Ducks' enforcers, a 6-foot-2, 220-pound right wing 
who is as at home in the penalty box as he is in his living room. 
</P>
<P>
 His hobby is writing and illustrating children's books that he hopes someday 
to publish. 
</P>
<P>
 They are stories he reads to his children, Tyler, 4, and Chad, 1, and they are 
about tolerating differences in others and the virtues of practicing your craft 
and following the beat of your own drum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hop -- A Frog Who Dared to Be Different," is dedicated to Tyler and Chad. 
Ewen penned the prologue: 
</P>
<P>
 A story about a frog who has the courage to be different. And about his 
friends, a dragonfly who reminds us of the importance of sharing our thoughts 
and fears and a ruffian cat who shows us that we can learn to enjoy and have 
fun with boys and girls who are different from ourselves.  
</P>
<P>
 This tender aesthetic bent in a fighter so brutish he was nicknamed "The 
Animal" while with the St. Louis Blues is invitation for ridicule, even from 
his own teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Stu Grimson, a gentleman tough guy whose only canvas is other players' faces, 
bends his 6-foot-5 frame over to peek at the drawings, "Hi, Hop! There's Hop!" 
</P>
<P>
 Center Anatoli Semenov, whose English vocabulary isn't vast, stops to look and 
strikes a museum-goer's pose, finger held thoughtfully against chin. Then he 
points to Ewen's name-plate above his dressing room stall, "Picasso, should say 
Picasso." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson stops by and picks up a drawing to inspect it. "He should use 
his feet," Wilson says. "His feet are probably more nimble. Less concrete." 
</P>
<P>
 If teammates tease like this, what of opponents? Ewen laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like bumping around, somebody will say, 'Hey, why don't you go sit down 
and draw some cartoons?' That's part of hockey. (Hartford's Pat) Verbeek, I 
think he's a third-generation pig farmer, so that doesn't come into play, ever 
. No one ever says anything about that ." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewen, 27, began working on the story several years ago when he was the road 
roommate of forward Ryan Walter with the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't go out a whole lot. We were kind of moviegoers in the room," Ewen 
said. "He had his computer there and we just started working on things. It was 
a good influence. I think he has his religious books published by now." 
</P>
<P>
 When Ewen began reading to his oldest son, Tyler, he found that the stories 
sometimes lacked lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at today's society and you hear so many things about money, you hear 
so many things about, 'I was an abused this,' or that or the other," Ewen said. 
"There seem to be so many people looking for scapegoats, rather than just 
looking and saying there is no morality anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be overbearing of me to go out and push my morals, but I think I'm 
justified in what I'm doing. If all you get is just enjoying the characters, 
that's fine. . . . But Hop is a little different character. He's not the same 
as everybody else. And I wanted to show that being different may set you away 
from your friends in the beginning, but in the end it will set you apart and 
they'll respect you." 
</P>
<P>
 As Ewen began to try his hand at writing a children's story, his first 
attempts showed him it was harder than it looked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tyler would just turn the pages," Ewen said, finding that the attention span 
of a toddler didn't allow for waxing poetic. Revision by revision, he found the 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
 The central character in the book is Hop, a frog whose favorite toys are a 
drum, a musical top, a miniature xylophone and his cherished guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever Hop's friends would ask him to play with them, he would say, "I'm 
sorry guys, but I would just like to practice my guitar."  
</P>
<P>
 Brat the Cat thought baseball was more fun. "Boys are supposed to play 
baseball, not play silly guitars."  
</P>
<P>
 Hop was sad that Brat did not like his guitar. "Why shouldn't I do what I 
enjoy doing the most?" he asked himself. To avoid being teased, Hop would walk 
through the woods to a small pond and play his guitar.  
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the others come to understand Hop and appreciate his talent. But 
for a time, Whisper the Dragonfly and Toller the Friendly Dragon are his only 
real friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Hi there! My name is Toller and every day you make me so happy when you play 
your guitar. I think you're keen because you practice so hard and try over and 
over again until the sound is right. Will you be my friend?  
</P>
<P>
 Ewen's drawing skills are mostly self-taught, though he has taken a class or 
two. Each character has gone through revisions, and Ewen was heartsick recently 
when many of his final drawings were lost while they were being sent to a 
friend to be scanned by computer. To some extent, he is starting over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hop, he's pretty well complete. I like his bulges, his round lines," Ewen 
said. "Whisper, I worked on him two or three months to where I thought he was 
animated enough to attract attention. It's not always the main characters that 
attract attention, sometimes it's the others, like the supporting cast in a 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Being on the road offers little time to work on the drawings, and Ewen is 
looking forward to re-doing some of the lost ones over the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play every second night, and with the travel, by the time you get home, 
the work would just be destroyed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He would like to see his book published, but was not seeking the help of his 
employer, the Walt Disney Co. However, Disney has recently called him to set up 
a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewen is cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney doesn't do anything they don't own 100% of. They don't buy ideas," he 
said. "Besides, it's more of an accomplishment to do it on your own." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewen has always gone his own way, once working as a roadie for a band and on a 
pit crew at a race track. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though he is known as a fighter and leads the Ducks with 144 penalty 
minutes, he is valuable in other ways. An assistant captain, he is one of the 
team leaders. And for all the talk about his fists, he has at times this season 
skated on the first line, showing skills that had been overlooked -- and 
scoring a career-high seven goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even his younger brother, Dean, who is close to signing a contract with 
the Ducks, is mindful that Todd is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always weird like that, a little artsy," Dean Ewen said, laughing. 
"He's an interesting individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Interesting, talented, sensitive, misunderstood. Hmmmm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you asking me if I'm Hop? Is that what you're asking me?" Todd said. "I 
don't think so. You see so many people that have -- not a disability in the 
sense of a handicap, but who are outside the ordinary. Although I am -- I feel 
I'm outside the ordinary for a hockey player. I've got this Jekyll-and-Hyde 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
 He gets no argument, and as he thumbs through his portfolio, Ewen pulls out 
another drawing with a look of faint puzzlement, then pride. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in crayon, a variation on the theme of a scribble. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Tyler's," Ewen said. "That's one of my kids' contributions."

HE COULD HAVE BEEN AMONG BEST; AFC CHAMPIONSHIP: CHIEFS' MARCUS ALLEN GOT 
CHEATED OUT OF HIS PROPER PLACE IN NFL LORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILBON, WASHINGTON POST

<TEXT>
<P>
 What happened to Marcus Allen is criminal. After a dozen NFL seasons, these 
twilight years ought to be one long toast to one of the most brilliant 
offensive careers in the league's history. He ought to be the subject of 
serious debate, such as, "Who's better, Payton or Allen? O.J. or Allen? 
Dickerson or Allen? Dorsett or Allen?" 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the primary questions asked about Allen since 1986 have been, "Where 
is he? What happened to him? How does a man with that much talent just drop off 
the face of the earth?" 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong, even at 34 and 10 years removed from his last 1,000-yard 
rushing season, Marcus Allen is of great value, as his 12 touchdowns this 
season for the Kansas City Chiefs attest. But you watch Allen now, you see that 
21-yard cutback run for a touchdown against the great Houston defense to clinch 
Sunday's AFC playoff victory and you can't help but be disturbed that between 
1986 and 1992 Marcus Allen was a virtual non-person. 
</P>
<P>
 He went into Al Davis' doghouse over a salary dispute before the 1986 season 
and it took free agency to lead him out of it and into Kansas City for 1993. He 
went from 380 carries in 1985 to 179 in 1990, from 18 touchdowns in 1984 to 
three in 1992, from being the most valuable player in Super Bowl XVIII to being 
benched in favor of somebody named Vann McElroy on critical third downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Overwhelmingly he was healthy, beloved almost to the point of worship by his 
teammates and coaches, of indisputable integrity and toughness. His principal 
sin was getting on Davis' bad side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost impossible to conceive of what happened to Marcus," his friend 
and NBC analyst O.J. Simpson said this week. "Everybody knew it was wrong; the 
question is, 'Why?' It's an answer I still don't have." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been so long, it's easy to have forgotten how exceptional and uncommon an 
offensive player Allen was. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rookie out of Southern Cal, in strike-shortened 1982, he rushed for 697 
yards and 11 touchdowns and caught 38 passes for three more touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 In '83, he rushed for 1,014 yards and nine touchdowns. Even more ridiculous is 
that he completed 4 of 7 passes for 111 yards and three touchdowns and 
recovered a ball in the end zone for yet another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 To cap that second year, he rushed for 191 yards in the Super Bowl against the 
Redskins and was named the game's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Allen, at 25, was on a rocket ship. 
</P>
<P>
 And then it crashed. A salary dispute led to a holdout. Essentially, it lasted 
until he got to Kansas City -- seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a teleconference with reporters Wednesday morning, Allen said it wouldn't 
"do anyone any good" to talk about his lost years with the Raiders, his 
theories of why Davis buried him on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 But Allen has gone on the record before, once in a revealing interview at 
halftime of a 1992 Monday Night Football telecast during which he said, "What 
do you think of a guy who has attempted to ruin your career? He told me he was 
going to get me and he has. . . . I think he tried to ruin the latter part of 
my career, tried to devalue me and tried to stop me from going to the Hall of 
Fame." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis called Allen's comments "blatant lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson admired Davis and Allen admired Simpson, all the way back to when 
Allen was a high school All-American in San Diego. Allen wound up at USC, just 
like Juice, and won the Heisman Trophy, just like Juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson recalled he had believed his protege and the owner he had always 
secretly wanted to play for would work things out. They didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen sat and sat. Word leaked that Davis had ordered coaches not to use Allen 
in short-yardage and goal-line situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches denied that Davis was interfering. "I'd watch games," Simpson said, 
"and I see third downs and Van McSomebody in the game instead of Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
 That's tantamount to taking Barry Sanders out of the game on third down and 
inserting some fourth-stringer." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Davis was responsible, single-handedly responsible. He held the most 
hurtful grudge imaginable: He wasted the better part of another man's career. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Davis has been a visionary in many ways, the Bill Veeck of the NFL. But 
this is the black mark on his record, the stain that can't be washed away. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven bum years, even if he was hurt twice ('89 and '91). 
</P>
<P>
 Allen would play hurt, Allen would try to rally the troops through the 
mid-week doldrums during losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 You know what his teammates did last year? They voted Allen the club's 
Commitment to Excellence Award. It was the only way they could say, "We support 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Allen, for more than half his career, was the NFL Players Association's 
best argument for free agency. Look what one man with power absolute could do 
to another without freedom of movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen told The Times: "You never forget what happens to you, but you have to 
get past it, you have to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "You try to stay busy enough that you don't have time to dwell on what 
happened. The biggest difference between here and the Raiders? Easy, here I'm 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Schottenheimer, the Chiefs' head coach, readily admits he foresaw Allen 
as a third-down back, a guy who could carry eight, 10 times a game and back up 
Harvey Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 One game from a trip to the Super Bowl, Schottenheimer says Allen is the 
toughest back he's ever coached, ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson laughs. "They brought him in as a third-down back and he's now the 
main back. 
</P>
<P>
 His fear, at least subconsciously, was that those years would keep him out of 
the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he's been spotlighted; this has probably cemented his going into the 
Hall. No matter what happens Sunday in Buffalo, this had been a triumphant year 
for Marcus Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 It proves from a performance and talent standpoint that Marcus was right."

MADDEN, SUMMERALL NEAR DEAL WITH FOX; TELEVISION: CBS' TOP NFL BROADCASTING 
CREW IS EXPECTED TO STAY TOGETHER AT DIFFERENT NETWORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 John Madden and Pat Summerall will sign with the Fox network as its lead NFL 
announcers, sources said Friday. An announcement is expected next week, 
possibly Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen anything or signed anything," Madden said Friday from Dallas, 
where he will work Sunday's NFC championship game between the Cowboys and San 
Francisco 49ers for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Summerall: "I'm just waiting to see what develops." 
</P>
<P>
 He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources said agreements have been reached and an announcement is 
forthcoming. Madden will make $7.5-million per year and Summerall in the 
$2-million range. 
</P>
<P>
 The same sources said it is likely that Fox will also hire Bob Stenner and 
Sandy Grossman, the producer and director on the Madden-Summerall team at CBS 
the last 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Madden and Stenner have the same agent, Barry Frank, and Summerall and 
Grossman are represented by Bob Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
 A source said Summerall was trying to work out a deal in which he could 
continue to do golf for CBS and football for Fox. Neal Pilson, CBS Sports 
president, and Rick Gentile, the executive in charge of production, earlier 
said that if Summerall signs with Fox, he will not work for CBS. And that 
reportedly will be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the original plan was to make the Summerall-Madden announcement 
after the Super Bowl, but things have speeded up. 
</P>
<P>
 According to another source, former Atlanta Falcon coach Jerry Glanville, 
although he has approached Jacksonville Jaguar officials about being their 
coach, is in line to become the studio analyst on Fox's planned one-hour 
pregame show. CBS' Pat O'Brien is a leading candidate to be the host. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago it was reported that it was "all but a done deal" that Madden 
was going to ABC's "Monday Night Football." The reports said Madden had agreed 
to a $2.5-million-a-year salary from ABC after spurning a $4.5-million offer 
from Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, another report said NBC had made an offer greater than Fox's, one 
that included having Madden serve as a worldwide spokesman for General 
Electric. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox came back one more time, offering what USA Today reported as a four-year 
contract worth $30 million, an average of $7.5-million per year. A source close 
to Madden said it took that kind of offer to get him. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day I'm going to ABC, the next I'm going to NBC and going to be a 
worldwide spokesman for GE, and now I'm supposed to be going to Fox," Madden 
said. "I can't keep track." 
</P>
<P>
 Betsy Hoffman, speaking for Fox, said the network had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox wrested the rights to the NFL's NFC package from CBS in December by 
agreeing to pay $1.58 billion over four years. That was $400 million more than 
the CBS bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox will begin televising the NFL next season, with CBS out of the picture. 
CBS has been televising the NFL since 1956, and Summerall and Madden have been 
the network's lead announcing team since 1981. Their final game for CBS will be 
Sunday's NFC championship game.

HOCKEY'S BEST WANT FIREWORKS -- WITHIN REASON; ALL-STAR GAME: THERE FIGURES TO 
BE PLENTY OF SCORING, BUT NO ONE SEEKS A REPEAT OF LAST SEASON'S 16-6 ROUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even King Coach Barry Melrose can't fault the size of the team he will have in 
today's NHL's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this season, Melrose lamented the Kings' lack of big players. One look 
at Dave Andreychuk, Al MacInnis, Sergei Fedorov, Joe Nieuwendyk and other 
members of the Western Conference squad during Friday's practice at Madison 
Square Garden brought a smile to Melrose's face. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first team picture I've been in in two years where Rob Blake 
wasn't the tallest guy," Melrose said of his 6-foot-3 defenseman. "There are at 
least three guys who are taller." 
</P>
<P>
 The West and the East, which is coached by Montreal's Jacques Demers, have 
size, depth and skill. And both coaches are determined to showcase those skills 
without repeating last year's 16-6 Wales Conference (now East) rout. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be offensive-minded, but we do not want to make it a joke," 
said Demers, who, as did Melrose, earned the all-star honor by guiding his team 
to last year's Stanley Cup final. "We can't have people turning their TVs off 
after one period. Let's say it ends 9-8. People will be satisfied. If it's 16-6 
again, people will switch to another sport." 
</P>
<P>
 As incentive to take the game more seriously, the NHL will pay $5,000 to each 
member of the winning team. The real appeal, though, is to players' pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to go out there and let too many goals by you," said Toronto's 
Felix Potvin, the fans' choice to start in goal for the West. "But you don't 
want to get too disappointed if you do, because there are a lot of great 
players in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said New York Ranger goalie Mike Richter: "Five thousand bucks is a lot. Hey, 
we have contests after every practice for a couple of bottles of Gatorade. . . 
. I think this game will be a little more interesting, maybe a little more 
defensive-oriented. But most of these guys were picked for their offensive 
talent, and we goalies just have to try to do our best." 
</P>
<P>
 The West boasts the league's top four scorers: the Kings' Wayne Gretzky, 
Fedorov of the Red Wings, Andreychuk -- the leader with 38 goals -- and Doug 
Gilmour of Toronto. The East has three of the NHL's stingiest goalies in 
Richter, Florida's John Vanbiesbrouck and starter Patrick Roy of Montreal; and 
three of the top scoring defensemen in Ray Bourque of the Boston Bruins, Garry 
Galley of the Philadelphia Flyers and Brian Leetch of the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Players' experience ranges from Gretzky's 14 consecutive selections, one short 
of Frank Mahovlich's record for most in a row, to 13 first-time honorees. For 
Vanbiesbrouck and Mighty Duck defenseman Alexei Kasatonov, it's a double first, 
because each represents an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud to be here," Kasatonov said. "It's for my family . . . history. I'm 
proud to be the first player from the Mighty Ducks." 
</P>
<P>
 The game will be light on strategy and heavy on reminders to have fun. Melrose 
planned to reunite Fedorov with his former Soviet linemate Pavel Bure and might 
complete the line with Gretzky. "That Selanne kid who plays the right side 
isn't bad, either," Melrose said of Winnipeg's Teemu Selanne, who scored 76 
goals last season. "It's fun to watch these guys play. It's fun just to be 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Bure, Fedorov and Selanne head a contingent of eight European-trained players, 
the largest such group at an NHL All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You watch guys like Bure and Mogilny and Fedorov, they have just such 
tremendous skills," Gretzky said, "and the thing about the skills is they do 
them at such a high-speed level. They've raised the level of our game a notch, 
and I think they fit into our game and have made it a better sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Demers hadn't decided his lines and defense pairs, but he intended to keep 
teammates together when possible to promote cohesion. That meant the Flyers' 
Eric Lindros centering for right wing Mark Recchi and playing the Rangers' Adam 
Graves to the left of Mark Messier. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a defenseman, I wouldn't mind seeing a little closer game," said Bourque, 
a four-time Norris Trophy winner. "Hopefully, we'll talk about things and go 
out with a semi-game plan. You have so many skilled guys, so you can't expect 
them to go out and check." 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, a first-time pick, hopes to see those skills translate into goals. 
"It's meant to be fun for the fans and the crowd, and if it's 1-1, it probably 
won't be as much fun," he said. "These players have great skills and I'm sure 
it's going to be exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Exciting enough to keep St. Louis right wing Brett Hull off the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone asked me if I'd rather play Augusta 36 holes a day or be here," he 
said, "and I'd rather be here."

JOHNSON PUTS IT ALL ON THE LINE; NFC: COWBOY COACH'S GUARANTEE OF A VICTORY 
OVER THE 49ERS PROMPTS AN UNCHARACTERISTIC RESPONSE FROM SEIFERT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson set a new personal standard for pregame hype, and 
George Seifert, his 49er counterpart, promptly went one step further. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has been known to boast, and Seifert, prone to understatement, 
exchanged verbal volleys in anticipation of Sunday's NFC championship game 
between Dallas and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, reacting to a radio interview with Coach Dan Reeves of the New York 
Giants on Thursday night, telephoned a Ft. Worth radio station from his car 
and, without qualification, pronounced the Cowboys the winners of Sunday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will win the ballgame," Johnson said. "And you can put it in three-inch 
headlines. We will win the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Morning News put Johnson's guarantee in half-inch type at the top 
of the front page of the newspaper Friday morning, right there next to the 
headline: "Whitewater case counsel expects to grill Clintons." 
</P>
<P>
 And Johnson was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we would have gotten three-inch headlines if the story had been on 
the sports page," he said. "Maybe we got three-inch headlines in San 
Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, however, Seifert apparently was not amused. Before leaving 
for Dallas, he pulled a Johnson and went on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the man's got balls, I'll tell you that," Seifert said. "I don't know 
if they're brass or papier-mache. We'll find out here pretty soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at Friday night's news conference, Johnson said he had heard a tape of 
Seifert's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not papier-mache," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters wanted to know if Johnson had been drinking before making his bold 
prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Johnson said. "If I had, I would have been much more emphatic. It was 
very early in the evening. I had just come from practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Emmitt Smith said: "Even if he did have a couple of pops it 
doesn't matter because the statement has been made." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he had thought about making his attention-getting announcement on 
Monday, but waited until the team had completed its preparations Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, here we are in the NFC championship game, and do you think I'm going 
to tiptoe around like I'm scared to death?" he asked. "I know my statements 
caused quite a stir, but I really don't see anything earthshaking about it. I 
just gave you my opinion, and in my opinion I think we're going to win the 
ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be a very tight game, but I do believe we'll make the plays 
in the fourth quarter to win it." 
</P>
<P>
 The most famous guarantee before a big game was delivered by quarterback Joe 
Namath of the New York Jets before Super Bowl III in 1969. The Jets, who were 
17-point underdogs, defeated the Baltimore Colts, 16-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe had more impact on the game than what I have," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Johnson's remarks were designed to distract the 49ers, they said it won't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all happens on Sunday," 49er quarterback Steve Young said. "Bruce Coslet 
did that last year when we played the Jets (and the 49ers won, 31-14)." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Seifert expect his team to win? 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that we will have a very good opportunity," Seifert said. "We 
worked very hard, we have a talented group of players and we go into the game 
optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how NFL coaches traditionally talk, but Johnson changed all that after 
hearing Reeves predict a Cowboy victory on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Well, if Dan is going to make a prediction, I'll just clear the 
whole thing up and I'll make a prediction,' " Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't more coaches do that? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really have any idea," he said. "Coaches do a lot of things. I think 
it's a strange bunch, to tell you the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Some consider Johnson the strangest of them all, and although his players 
admire his confidence, they were admittedly caught off guard this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did he do it?" asked Nate Newton, Cowboy guard. "I majored in physical 
education, not psychology. All I know is he put our (butt) in the frying pan." 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Derrick Lassic said: "This shows he believes we can walk on 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cowboy owner Jerry Jones supported his coach. "When I heard that, that we 
were going to win, well I just slept like a baby," he said. "It's done. It's 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 But what if the Cowboys lose? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, we go out there to do one thing and that's to win games," Johnson said. 
"And I don't ever look at the alternative."

AUTHORITIES IN THE KERRIGAN CASE ARE STILL SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS; 
INVESTIGATION: THEY SAY THEY WILL WORK THROUGH WEEKEND TO DECIDE IF HARDING 
SHOULD BE CHARGED IN JAN. 6 ATTACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even though authorities expect no arrests this weekend, they said Friday that 
they plan to work through the weekend in hopes of finding some resolution to 
the bizarre case surrounding the attack on figure skater Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 A top official said that he expected the case to wrap up next week, which will 
finally settle the question of whether national champion Tonya Harding was 
involved in the plot to harm Kerrigan in the Jan. 6 assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, presiding Judge Donald H. Londer granted a request by 
Multnomah County prosecutors to give the grand jury until Feb. 3 to issue their 
report on the four men who already have been arrested. But the grand jury, 
which a spokesperson said adjourned for the weekend, can return indictments or 
clear the accused at anytime before then. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aim is to get all the indictments that are going to be done in one 
swoop," said Bart Gori of the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Harding continued to skate at a nearby rink in preparation for the 
Winter Olympics, which begin in three weeks in Lillehammer, Norway. The U.S. 
Figure Skating Assn. has to name the Olympic team with alternates by Jan. 31. 
After that deadline, the U.S. Olympic Committee has until Feb. 21 -- the day of 
the women's draw -- to decide who is going to skate. If Harding is replaced, it 
would be first alternate, Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 No charges have been filed against Harding, and Friday she once again 
proclaimed her innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that what I have done, I haven't done anything wrong," Harding said. 
"The whole thing is frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding skated well in front of a crowd of about 100, which included a 
surprise visit from her mother, LaVona Golden. When Harding spotted her 
standing at the rail, she skated over to her and gave her a hug. Their rocky 
relationship has been chronicled for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 18 years I gave up everything to get her what she wanted," Golden said. 
"She has spent 18 years trying to fulfill her dream. Now it's ruined." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, though, doesn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anything is ruined," she said. "I'm not concerned about it at 
all. . . . I don't care if I wasn't going to get one endorsement, I just want 
to skate the best I can." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the only one to implicate Harding publicly in the conspiracy is Shawn 
Eckardt, her former bodyguard. If the case hinges on his testimony, attorneys 
realize Eckardt's credibility will be on the line. Eckardt's attorney, Mark 
McNight, says he is working on getting evidence against Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are aware his credibility is at issue and corroborating facts are 
necessary or he will be torn apart," McNight said. "Shawn is conveniently 
placed in the scheme in the alleged conspiracy. He's at the center of a four or 
five-link conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt, along with Shane Stant, Derrick Smith and Jim Gillooly, Harding's 
former husband, have been arrested. Stant, Smith and Eckardt have confessed and 
are reportedly trying to arrange plea bargains. An authority involved in the 
case said there are no new names being investigated, which means that only one 
question remains -- Was Harding involved?

MORNING BRIEFING: '92 GOLD MEDAL HAS HER SINGING DIFFERENT TUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cathy Turner won an Olympic gold medal in short-track speedskating in 1992 and 
says it helped her find out who she was. Now, after nearly two years away from 
the sport, Turner will try again for the gold in the Lillehammer Games. She 
says she has forever shed the persona of Nicki Newland, a pop singer who wrote 
a song about herself called, "Sexy, Kinky Tomboy." 
</P>
<P>
 She was Nicki Newland for eight years before becoming Cathy Turner again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little bit of crazy, a little bit of wild," she told Phil Hersh of 
the Chicago Tribune. "I had to find out who I was and it wasn't easy. I had an 
identity crisis. The day I decided to skate again was the day I knew exactly 
who I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the layoff, Turner was the No. 1 American qualifier for next month's 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the Laker record for most points in a game? 
</P>
<P>
 Turnaround: Starting play this week, Boston, Detroit, Dallas and the Lakers 
either shared last place or were in the cellar alone in their divisions, with a 
combined 34-104 record. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, those four teams played in the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Scary: Considering the Minnesota Timberwolves' poor record, it is perhaps 
appropriate that one of their biggest fans is horror novelist Stephen King. 
</P>
<P>
 After one of Minnesota's rare victories this season, King sent 14 dozen roses 
to the team's players and coaches. Each player received a personal 
congratulatory note. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: Tiger Williams, the NHL's all-time leader in penalty minutes, 
believes NHL players are too soft -- and reporters are too hard on players who 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players aren't as tough mentally as they used to be," he said. "A lot of that 
has to do with you (reporters) out there. The media takes a run at the NHL any 
time anything happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Dale Hunter did to Pierre Turgeon last year did not deserve 25% of the 
season. In Gordie Howe's day, to get 25 games, you had to pretty near kill the 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter crosschecked Turgeon from behind after Turgeon had scored, knocking him 
out of one series in the playoffs last spring. Hunter subsequently was 
suspended for the first quarter of this season. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: Dick Linthicum, not Walt Hazzard, was UCLA's first consensus 
basketball All-American. Linthicum made the 1931 and 1932 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not?Autograph hounds have always been something that athletes and 
celebrities had to endure, but a fan once told U.S. mile record-holder Steve 
Scott what many athletes had long suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I was signing autographs before a big meet and a lady came up and said, 
'I haven't the faintest idea who you are, but since you're signing autographs 
for everybody else, you might as well sign one for me.' " Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 True story: According to Lee Solters, a department store in Greenwood, S.C., 
had just put up a display of fishing tackle when a customer picked up one of 
the newest lures and inspected its gleaming metal and plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do the fish really go for these things," he asked the salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dunno," was the reply. "We don't sell 'em to the fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Elgin Baylor, with 71 against the New York Knicks on Nov. 15, 
1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Montreal goalie Patrick Roy, on today's NHL All-Star game: "It's an 
offensive game, not too much defense. It's a show. We (the goalies) don't enjoy 
ourselves in the same way the forwards do." SHAV GLICK

<TEXT>
<P>
 * HAVE IT YOUR WAY, JIM KELLY: How bad have things been for the Kansas City 
Chief defensive backfield? 
</P>
<P>
 Playing safety for them in Sunday's AFC championship game will be a player 
they recently signed from . . . Burger King. 
</P>
<P>
 That is where Felix Wright had been working when he was recently reunited with 
his former Cleveland Brown coach, Marty Schottenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, 33, has not played this season. Last month, he was the guest of honor 
at his own retirement party. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, the Chiefs called, begging. This is what happens when you go 
through nine defensive backs and three of your four opening-day starters are on 
injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my wildest dreams, I never thought I'd be here," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 * NEWTON'S LAWS: Nate Newton, the cheerful guard for the Dallas Cowboys, held 
court in the locker room Friday afternoon, offering as much wit as wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 On the collapse of the New York Giants: "For the Giants to get past the 49ers, 
I knew that would take a damn miracle. It would have taken chemical warfare. 
The Giants were so tired after playing us and the Vikings, you could see it 
when the 49ers blitzed. Nobody damn moved." 
</P>
<P>
 On the current athletic wear commercial featuring Dennis Hopper sniffing Bruce 
Smith's shoes: "I really like that when he's smelling Bruce's shoes and says, 
'Bad things happen, man, bad things.' Yeah, like foot fungus." 
</P>
<P>
 On Coach Jimmy Johnson: "He always says, 'If I don't tell you something, face 
to face, then don't believe what those . . . write about you in the newspaper.' 
But then he put into his book that, 'Yeah, sometimes I try to motivate players 
through the media.' I don't know which Coach Johnson to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 * ADD NEWTON: During the post-practice interview session in the Cowboy locker 
room Friday, Newton's voice boomed over the intercom. He was warning players 
not to appear on linebacker Ken Norton's radio show without receiving their 
appearance gift first. 
</P>
<P>
 Newton claimed that Norton owed several players, including himself, a pair of 
sunglasses. He announced that this was unfair, considering, "the man lives in a 
$500,000 house in Plano. He has all these sunglasses in that $500,000 house in 
Plano." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Newton said that the announcement was not a practical joke. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is serious," he said. "Norton acts like he's been hanging around Bill 
Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 * FROM ONE THRILLER TO ANOTHER: When asked if he could guarantee a victory as 
did his coach, Emmitt Smith of the Cowboys replied: "Somebody once told me 
there are only three things guaranteed in life: You are going to stay the same 
color, you are going to pay taxes and you are going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 * THAT'S WHY THE VIKING DEFENSE LOOKED CONFUSED: While trying in vain to stop 
the Giants' rushing attack several weeks ago in the first round of the 
playoffs, Minnesota nose tackle Esera Tuaolo was shouting the defensive signals 
in Samoan.

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; THERE'S NO GUARANTEE HE WILL STAY; BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The next thing we know, Jimmy Johnson is showing up Sunday with a perm. 
</P>
<P>
 And agreeing to let Jerry Jones coach the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 And awarding the game ball to a kicker. 
</P>
<P>
 The next thing we know, Jimmy Johnson is hoisting a Super Bowl trophy above 
his ruddy face and announcing . . . that he is leaving the Dallas Cowboys to 
coach the Jacksonville Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
 Could that explain his recent erratic behavior? 
</P>
<P>
 Could that be the reason this obsessively neat person has spent the week 
drawing on the walls of the Cowboys' Valley Ranch training complex? 
</P>
<P>
 Might this not be his home anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 "It would not surprise me a bit if he left this year," said Bill Bates, 
veteran Cowboy safety. "Just when you think you got him pegged, he does 
something else that makes you think you will never have him figured out." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Nate Newton agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would not surprise me a bit if he was gone," he said. "Actually, the only 
thing that would surprise me about Jimmy would be if he gave me a six-year, 
$50-million contract." 
</P>
<P>
 That Johnson is setting himself up to seek greater challenges elsewhere is 
only one of the theories surrounding his recent public quotes and pokes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the span of four working days, Johnson has: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Guaranteed a victory Sunday over the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC 
championship game here. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Questioned the reputation of 49er quarterback Steve Young because he has 
not won a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ripped Gary Stevens, Miami Dolphin offensive coordinator and close friend 
of Don Shula. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Admitted that he gives special treatment to former University of Miami 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Emphasized he and owner Jones are not lifelong friends and do not 
socialize. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Urged Cowboys fans to get drunk before Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson even spoke directly about leaving the Cowboys, upon being asked 
whether his victory guarantee would come back to haunt him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those coaches who say what goes around, comes around are usually on the short 
end of things," he said. "Yes, this might 'go around.' But it might 'go around' 
against some coach other than me." 
</P>
<P>
 Constructing championships from scrap heaps has traditionally left Johnson 
bored. He wins, then runs. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the Jaguars last month, he admitted to being intrigued by the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never say never," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This response upset Jones, who is becoming increasingly disillusioned with his 
loud headmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you aren't interested in something, you say that, just like that," Jones 
said. "That's how it works in the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering Johnson has five years remaining on a Cowboy contract worth $1 
million a year, this attempted flight could be his most dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think he is going anywhere," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 So then what's with all the posturing? Could Johnson really think that his 
Cowboys are so good, he can win this game with a smile? 
</P>
<P>
 Did he really make that guarantee because he simply felt like throwing out his 
chest? 
</P>
<P>
 Or was this merely part of a concerted effort to rattle Young, who has proven 
that it doesn't take much. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Dallas, Steve. The opposing coach guaranteed a victory. What do you 
think?  
</P>
<P>
 In all this, only one thing is truly guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Cowboys lose Sunday, Johnson will wish he was gone. IF JIMMY CAN DO IT, 
SO CAN WE 
</P>
<P>
 It's guaranteed that the San Francisco 49ers will be playing the Kansas City 
Chiefs in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 On a normal afternoon, the Cowboys are a better team than the 49ers. They are 
quicker, stronger and far more composed. 
</P>
<P>
 And they can expect 120 yards in 30 carries from Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday will not be a normal afternoon. Not when Smith feels much more pain 
than anyone will admit. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to protect his separated shoulder, he is backing into gaps. He is 
running out of bounds for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't even finish a playoff game against the Green Bay Packers and that 
was only one week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On an afternoon without a sound Emmitt Smith, the Cowboys are merely a normal 
team, the kind the 49ers have been whipping all season. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Young finishes, former teammate Joe Montana will already be 
waiting for him after leading the Kansas City Chiefs over the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills were not even close to the Chiefs in their Kansas City game this 
year, a 23-7 victory for the Chiefs. In the two months since, the gap has not 
been closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana has grown more comfortable, while Jim Kelly of the Bills has merely 
looked older. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana's aura has spread, even to his defense, which shut down a good running 
attack in Houston on Sunday. The Buffalo defense could not stop the Raider 
running game. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Montana against Young in the most intriguing Super Bowl ever. 
Guaranteed. FLAG FLAP II 
</P>
<P>
 NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced an important decision a couple of 
weeks ago that could haunt him now. 
</P>
<P>
 He refused to force the people who run the Georgia Dome to take down the state 
flag -- which is partly made up of a Confederate emblem -- from outside the 
building when the Super Bowl is played there. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so he learned his lesson about mixing politics and football during the 
Phoenix Super Bowl debacle a couple of years ago. But aren't we talking about 
more than just politics here? Aren't we talking about dignity? 
</P>
<P>
 "You talk to me about this next week if we get there," said Tommie Agee, 
veteran running back for the Cowboys. "All players who played in the South are 
used to this, but still . . . this is something we'll have to see about." 
GETTING EVEN 
</P>
<P>
 When Emmitt Smith takes an injury break in Sunday's NFC championship game -- 
and he will -- two young running backs will finally have a chance to prove 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 One is Derrick Lassic, who was abused by fans and teammates while playing 
during Smith's holdout early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember when Charles Haley put his helmet through a wall in a defining moment 
after the Cowboys fell to 0-2? He was angry at Lassic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through a lot of hard times," Lassic said. "To get a chance now, with 
all I've seen, I'll be ready." 
</P>
<P>
 The other back is Lincoln Coleman. This time last year, he was working on a 
department store loading dock. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, he was loading customers' cars at Home Depot. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Baylor running back -- before he flunked out of school after the 
1990 season -- was signed this summer on a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been spotted playing in the Arena Football League by a Cowboy trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 Since leaving college, he had also played for a local semipro team, the Dallas 
Colts, earning $5 a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I'm able to sit back and look at this, I'm sure I'll say, 'Oh, Lord,' " 
Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the right circumstances Sunday, fans could be saying that a lot sooner.

 St. Louis again missed getting a NFL team when it was announced Friday that 
the Patriots would stay in New England. 
</P>
<P>
 James Busch Orthwein told a news conference in Boston that Robert Kraft, owner 
of Foxboro Stadium where the Patriots play, will buy the 35-year-old 
professional team. The sale must be approved by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis earlier hoped to get one of the two new franchises awarded by the 
NFL this year, but the league gave one of the teams to Charlotte, N.C., on Oct. 
26 and then awarded the second to Jacksonville, Fla., on Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Kroenke, a Columbia, Mo., shopping center magnate who headed a group of 
businessmen trying to secure a team for St. Louis, said Friday's decision did 
not surprise him. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as we'd like to see NFL football back in St. Louis, it's clear that 
Mr. Kraft faces far fewer obstacles in purchasing the Patriots than does any 
other party and we understand Jim Orthwein's decision in this regard," Kroenke 
said. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Bill Walsh was reported to be interested in at least hearing from the NFL's 
new Jacksonville Jaguars about their head coaching vacancy, though he said he 
is staying at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaguar owner J. Wayne Weaver and President David Seldin met with Walsh on 
Friday in Palo Alto, but Walsh then issued a statement through the Stanford 
sports information office saying he was not a candidate "for any position in 
football, either on the professional or collegiate level. I continue to be very 
excited about our Stanford football program and I plan to remain at Stanford as 
its head coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, 62, who led the San Francisco 49ers to Super Bowl championships in 
1982, 1984 and 1988, is the third former NFL coach to be linked with the 
Jaguars. Former Chicago Bear coach Mike Ditka sent the team a letter expressing 
his interest, and former Atlanta Falcon coach Jerry Glanville said he also has 
contacted the new team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jaguars have a stated policy of not commenting on specific coaching or 
general manager candidates.

 Fired New York Jet coach Bruce Coslet is returning to the Cincinnati Bengals, 
where he spent eight years as a player and nine seasons as an assistant.

 Bengal Coach Dave Shula said Coslet again is joining the team as offensive 
coordinator.

 Tight end Eric Green will join four other Pittsburgh Steelers on the AFC Pro 
Bowl squad.

Green will back up Shannon Sharpe of the Denver Broncos.

 Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean won the ice dance title, but Katarina Witt, 
another former Olympic champion on the comeback trail, fell out of contention 
in her event Friday at the European Figure Skating Championships at Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
 Torvill and Dean won one of the closest finishes ever, edging two Russian 
couples, Oksana Gritschuk and Evgeni Platov, and Maya Usova and Aleksandr 
Zhulin, the defending world and European champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Torvill and Dean, the dance stars from the 1984 Olympics, finished second in 
the free dance, behind Gritschuk and Platov, who had three 6.0s in artistic 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
 But Torvill and Dean finished second, ahead of Usova and Zhulin, in the final 
portion of the event and took the overall title. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt, the two-time Olympic champion, was in tears after finishing ninth in the 
women's technical program. 
</P>
<P>
 France's Surya Bonaly, three-time European champion, edged Oksana Baiul of 
Ukraine, the current world champion, in the program that counted for one-third 
of the total score. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's final free skate is today. Witt needs to finish among the top two 
Germans here to advance to the Olympics. Tanja Szewczenko, who beat her at the 
German meet, was in fifth. Marina Kielmann, the other German, was 14th.

 Robert Smith of Moorpark, the only amateur in the field, can pull a rare feat 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three non-professionals in 36 years of pro bowling have won on the 
national Professional Bowlers Assn. tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith can become the fourth to pull it off in the nationally televised title 
roll-off of the $220,000 AC/Delco tournament at noon at Cal Bowl in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 20, the National Amateur champion who attended Royal High in Simi 
Valley, earned the No. 1 seeding with a 42-game total of 9,643.  
</P>
<P>
 Other finalists, in order of their seeding: Norm Duke, Oklahoma City, 9,567; 
Ken Muscato, Canandaigua, N.Y., 9,484; Justin Hromek, Andover, Kan., 9,436, and 
Steve Wilson, Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., 9,394. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith gained a berth in the PBA event by beating 60 others in a win-a-spot 
"sweeper" tournament last week.  
</P>
<P>
 And should he win, he is entitled to the $44,000 prize.

Switzerland at noon today at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States defeated Norway last week, 2-1, coming from behind in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swiss have brought a strong but not fully fit team, because most teams in

SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE: IT'S TIME FOR SLUMPING KITT TO TAKE FOOT OFF THE BRAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 So, who wants to tell the downhill racer that he needs to go faster? 
</P>
<P>
 You think AJ Kitt doesn't know? 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt spits speed. Once, he described -- in what he considered layman's terms 
-- the sensation of going 60 m.p.h. down the side of a mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say you're in a car with four other people, going 120 m.p.h.," Kitt said, as 
if people routinely did this sort of thing. "Everyone shuts up, everyone grabs 
a handle, everybody starts thinking about their safety and everybody starts 
concentrating on what's ahead, including the driver. In that way, you're almost 
in your own little world." 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt began the season as perhaps America's best hope for an Olympic medal in 
Alpine skiing. He was in his own little world. 
</P>
<P>
 He kicked down the downhill door last year and established himself as an 
international star, despite winding up with little to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt led the first World Cup downhill at Val d'Isere, France, before it was 
canceled because of weather. He led the Aspen downhill before it was canceled, 
unjustly by judges, because of a small hole in the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt did get to keep the bronze medal he won at the World Championships, a 
race he could have won except for one minor technical glitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some setbacks, Kitt, 25, seemed poised to pounce on this Olympic 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 His climb through the U.S. ski team ranks had been methodical and calculated. 
His career course was steady, not spectacular, until he cracked the World Cup 
scene with two top-10 finishes in 1990. Then, in 1992 at Val d'Isere, Kitt 
became the first American to win a World Cup downhill since Bill Johnson in 
1984. That year Kitt also finished second at the famed Hahnenkamm at 
Kitzbuehel, Austria, and ninth in the Olympic downhill at Albertville. 
</P>
<P>
 But the weeks leading to the Lillehammer Games have been strangely quiet for 
Kitt, who has watched teammate Tommy Moe surpass him as America's speed king. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe advances toward Lillehammer with the necessary momentum, confident of his 
medal chances on the slopes at Kvitfjell, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 While Moe has been king of the hill, Kitt has been mostly been middle of the 
pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe ranks sixth in the World Cup downhill standings. Kitt is 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Moe shined at Kitzbuehel, finishing eighth in the downhill and 
fourth in the combined. Kitt was 33rd in downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt is not skiing horribly -- he has 11th- and 13th-place finishes -- but 
ho-hum performances were not what he had in mind when he began what he believed 
would be a dominating season. 
</P>
<P>
 To set the tone, Kitt even shaved his head before the first race. But he has 
been anything but razor sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. ski team officials insist there is nothing physically wrong with Kitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 "AJ's in great shape," Paul Major, the U.S. Alpine director, said recently. 
"He's in fantastic shape. He's skiing technically well in races, but there's 
been some inconsistency there with AJ." 
</P>
<P>
 Major maintains that Kitt's problems might stem from his overzealous workout 
regimen last summer, when he hired a personal trainer and doubled his summer 
off-season skiing days from 25 to 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Major warned Kitt that such a drastic departure from the norm might affect his 
early-season results. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you dramatically increase your sports-specific training, you expect to 
have a downfall in your results," Major said. "I told him, 'Expect to not have 
a good December, but then the results will pick up after that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Kitt has yet to show improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished 31st at Bormio, Italy, on Dec. 29, 13th at Saalbach, Austria, on 
Jan. 6 and 33rd at Kitzbuehel. 
</P>
<P>
 The race to Lillehammer heats up considerably in the next few weeks, with 
three downhills scheduled before the men's Olympic downhill Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe and Kitt -- who take their rivalry seriously -- take their shots this 
weekend in another big race at Wengen, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe, younger at 23, is king for now, but he doesn't underestimate his rival. 
</P>
<P>
 "AJ definitely has been in the spotlight for the U.S. for the last couple of 
years, and I think he was a good mentor for me because I had somebody to 
chase," he said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Moe doesn't know what's wrong with Kitt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say," Moe said. "He can click at any time, too, and pop into the 
top three. He's definitely got to get his act together a little bit more right 
now. I'm just kind of on a roll, and I have a lot of confidence going right 
now. I think AJ is definitely skiing well, but now I think I'm the top guy." 
Ski Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. men's giant slalom team, which had not scored a World Cup point all 
season, finally cracked the top 30 when Jeremy Nobis placed 28th in a recent 
race. Only the top 30 finishers are awarded World Cup points. . . . After much 
outrage and confusion, the International Ski Federation (FIS) at last canceled 
a women's super-giant slalom raced two Saturdays ago at Altenmarkt, Austria. 
Twenty-six of the first 32 skiers crashed in the finish area. The race was 
halted, but results were later made official by the FIS despite its own rule 
that disallows any race in which half of the competitors do not start. Less 
than half the field raced at Altenmarkt, and it took the FIS only a week to 
figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Moe's fourth-place finish in the combined at Kitzbuehel was the highest 
for an American since 1984, when Phil Mahre took third. . . . Hilary Lindh, 
defending 1992 Olympic silver medalist, is charging after a slow start and 
ranks eighth overall in World Cup downhill, with Picabo Street 13th. Heidi 
Voelker ranks seventh in giant slalom, with Eva Twardokens ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California ski areas that are open report no earthquake damage to 
roads leading into the mountains. And, though there is no natural snow to speak 
of, skiing is said to be surprisingly good because of cool nighttime 
temperatures and sophisticated snow-making capabilities. . . . Mountain High 
East and West are open and offer night skiing daily. The Big Bear resorts are 
also in full operation. Snow Summit is operating 10 lifts and night skiing. 
Bear Mountain has 32 groomed trails available and Snow Valley has 23 trails and 
seven lifts open. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Baldy has closed and will not reopen until the next significant snowfall. 
Forecasters are projecting that a series of storms will pass through Southern 
California, beginning this weekend. Spokesman John Koulouris said Mt. Baldy 
could reopen soon after the first storm.

CSUN-CAL GAME, ON SHAKY FOOTING, IS BACK ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cal State Northridge's on-again, off-again date with California for a men's 
basketball game is on again. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Cassidy, Northridge's coach, and John Kasser, Cal's athletic director, 
said Friday their teams will meet Feb. 7 in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams were scheduled to play tonight but the game was postponed because of 
Monday's 6.6 earthquake, centered in Northridge. Cal initially asked that the 
game be rescheduled for Monday night. When Northridge officials declined it 
appeared the game would be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge has not played or practiced since falling to Colorado, 100-85, 
Monday night in Boulder, Colo. The school's gym is unusable because fallen 
lights and debris are littering the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge campus is closed until at least Monday, school President Blenda 
J. Wilson said Friday. Bob Hiegert, Northridge's athletic director, said it 
might be more than a week until the gym's hardwood surface is playable. 
</P>
<P>
 The gym passed an initial inspection by a structural engineer, but it must 
pass another examination next week and then be thoroughly cleaned and repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy said he was trying to find an alternative site for the team to 
practice, beginning Monday. Northridge will make its next scheduled trip, 
against Northeastern Illinois on Jan. 29 in Chicago, and then at Notre Dame on 
Jan. 31 in South Bend, Ind., Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also keeping their next scheduled competition dates will be Northridge's 
women's basketball and men's volleyball teams. The basketball team will play at 
Pacific on Tuesday night and at San Francisco on Wednesday night. The men's 
volleyball team, which has been practicing at Occidental College, will open 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation action Wednesday night at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Casualties of the earthquake are Northridge's swim and diving home meet next 
Saturday against San Diego and UC Irvine, and a quadrangular track meet 
scheduled for the same day with Irvine, Southern Utah and Northern Arizona in 
Flagstaff, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Strametz, Northridge's track and field coach, told Hiegert he would be 
unable to organize his scattered team in time for the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, Strametz has been unable to reach two athletes, although a 
third who was unaccounted for, weightman Mike McClintock, checked in Friday.

EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE CHASES SEVERAL AREA TEAMS OFF FLOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Numerous area high school basketball teams have been transformed into nomads 
by Monday's deadly earthquake that left in its wake damaged gymnasiums in the 
San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany in Mission Hills and L.A. Baptist in North Hills plan to play the rest 
of the season on the road because their gyms suffered substantial structural 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-ranked Hart (18-1) also might be forced to the road because of earthquake 
damage. Meanwhile, Foothill League administrators spent Friday discussing 
whether to curtail the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gyms at six City Section schools -- Chatsworth, Kennedy, Monroe, Reseda, 
Sylmar and Verdugo Hills -- are unusable because they have been deemed unsafe 
or are being used as shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's gym reportedly has been condemned, and the status of the team's 
home games is undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no idea what we're going to do right now," Simi Valley Coach Dean 
Bradshaw said. "We're still trying to figure this out. We're looking at 
different options, but we know nothing for certain right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany Athletic Director Dudley Rooney has been heartened because the gym 
seemed salvageable after the school initially faced the prospect of losing it 
completely. Rooney said the gym is approximately 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to think they might be able to salvage the gym, but we won't be 
able to use it the rest of the season," he said. "We're already looking for 
alternative sites. It's a monumental task, but we're committed to keeping our 
winter sports programs going." 
</P>
<P>
 The condition of the L.A. Baptist gym built in 1971 also has been upgraded 
from initial reports, according to basketball Coach Maury Neville. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks better today, but we're practicing outside," he said. "I think we've 
lost it for the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart faces a similar fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pillars along the sides are cracked and tilted, and the walls are 
leaning," said Hart senior guard Eric Spindt, who viewed the gym with his 
father, assistant coach Gary Spindt, on Thursday. "Another sizable aftershock 
and I think the thing will come down." 
</P>
<P>
 Those high schools might turn to The Master's College as an alternate site. 
The gym at the Newhall school escaped significant damage and Hart and Canyon 
have practiced there this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gym has held up so well that it could be used for a shelter," said Jack 
Mutz, an assistant baseball coach at The Master's who is also in charge of 
scheduling athletic events at Bross Gymnasium. "That's what the city officials 
told us when they were out her today inspecting it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mutz added that L.A. Baptist has inquired about hosting a first-round game of 
the Southern Section playoffs at Master's on Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators from Canyon, Hart and Saugus met Friday to explore options 
regarding the continuation of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 The league, which also includes Burroughs and Burbank, might cancel its third 
round of play or hold a league tournament in its place, according to Dave 
Harris, Canyon athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 Gyms at Canyon and Saugus emerged from the quake relatively unscathed, Harris 
said, but both are being used as Red Cross shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The preliminary (decision) was to just to complete round two of the league 
schedule and that's all that's been determined right now," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators from all five league schools are expected to meet again early 
next week, but no league games likely will be played until Jan. 29, Harris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior college athletic facility in the area hardest hit is at Pierce, 
where the men's gym suffered major damage. Pierce fields a women's basketball 
team only. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been told that the men's gym right now is condemned because one wall is 
off its foundation," said Marian McWilliams, the school's athletic director. "I 
was told the women's gym is not as bad. A beam fell from the ceiling and 
cracked the floor. We are still trying to assess what the damage is." 
</P>
<P>
 Other area junior college athletic facilities apparently suffered only minor 
damage, although some are still unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Smelser, athletic director and basketball coach at Canyons, said the 
school's gym is structurally fine but without water or power. The Glendale 
College gym also escaped damage, basketball Coach Brian Beauchemin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark College gym suffered damage when air ducts broke through the 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley College also had problems with lights in the men's gym but it is 
usable.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: TROPHY-TRUCK DEBUT IS SIMON'S TO SAVOR 
</P>

<P>
 Professional off-road racing has taken on a new look this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Racing vehicles, built to look like trucks but to run like desert buggies, 
became so dominant in SCORE International open competition in recent years that 
officials created a new division for them. They will even have their own races, 
shorter than the regular events. 
</P>
<P>
 The factory-backed Trophy-Truck class made its debut Thursday as Part I of the 
21st annual Parker 400 race in the Arizona desert, adjacent to the Colorado 
river -- the opening event of the SCORE season. All other classes will make up 
Part II today. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Simon of Fallbrook, driving a Ford, won the 215-mile truck race by seven 
minutes over Rob MacCachren of Las Vegas, also in a Ford. Thirteen drivers, the 
cream of off-road racing, were entered. Simon averaged 57.06 m.p.h. for the 
3-hour 46-minute ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started in front and didn't see anyone the whole way," said Simon, who 
also won the 1992 Baja 1000 while driving with his brother David. "It was a 
definite advantage starting first. We were going 135 (m.p.h.) down the graded 
road." 
</P>
<P>
 Heavily favored Ivan Stewart finished 10th after his Toyota suffered two 
mechanical breakdowns, a broken suspension part early in the going and a broken 
rear axle later. Last year, the veteran Alpine, Calif., driver won the Parker 
race and then swept the Baja 500, Nevada (formerly the Mint) 400 and the Baja 
1000 while driving solo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the new-car blues," Stewart said. "We were trying out a new chassis 
and sometimes you have to expect little problems like that. I'll say this, 
though. I don't like these sprint races. It was more like a big stadium race 
than a desert race." 
</P>
<P>
 The trucks were scheduled Thursday to accommodate drivers and crewmen who were 
also planning to race tonight in the Mickey Thompson stadium race in Anaheim 
Stadium. However, that event has been postponed to Feb. 12 because of 
earthquake damage to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Indy car driver Robby Gordon had a bad day all around. First, he was 
disqualified for driving at a high speed in an unauthorized area Wednesday, but 
after a hearing he was let off with a $5,000 fine and a year's probation. 
Driving his own Ford truck, Gordon failed to finish and left without comment to 
catch a plane for Naples, Fla., where he is scheduled to test one of Derrick 
Walker's Lola-Ford Cosworth Indy cars today and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three competitors in the Trophy-Truck race will demonstrate how closely the 
trucks resemble buggies by taking off the panels and racing the stripped-down 
trucks in the Class 1 race for unlimited buggies today. The three are Jim Smith 
of Garden Grove, winner of the 1992 Parker 400; Danny Letner of Orange, at 66 
the oldest driver in the race and 1989 Parker winner; and Bob Richey of Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 The race will begin and end at the Blue Water Marina in Parker, Ariz. Motor 
Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 INDY CARS -- Former Indy 500 winner Arie Luyendyk, who lost his ride with Chip 
Ganassi's team when Michael Andretti decided to return from Formula One, has 
signed with Sal Incandela to drive a Lola-Ilmor for the Indy Regency team. 
Luyendyk was the pole-winner at last year's 500. . . . Another former 500 
winner, Danny Sullivan, will try NASCAR Winston Cup racing after losing his 
sponsor, Molson Breweries, and his ride with Galles Racing. Sullivan, who won 
the Detroit Grand Prix last year, will drive in selected races -- not the 
Daytona 500 -- with Felix Sabates' team. 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- Kern County Raceway officials at Willow Springs have canceled 
Sunday's KCR Challenge winter series program because of problems related to the 
earthquake. Also canceled is next Saturday's race. The series will resume Feb. 
13. . . . IMCA modifieds will run tonight at Imperial Raceway near El Centro. 
Western regional champion Scott Pounds of Bakersfield is slated to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 DRAG RACING -- The Budweiser Warm-Up at Bakersfield Raceway -- a final tuneup 
before the Chief Winternationals open the National Hot Rod Assn. season in two 
weeks at the Pomona Raceway -- is scheduled for this weekend. Side-by-side 
testing for top fuel and funny cars is scheduled at noon today and Sunday. . . 
. MOTOCROSS -- Jeremy McGrath, who won a record 10 races in his first 
Supercross season, is back at it. The Honda rider from Murietta won the Camel 
Supercross season opener last week in Orlando, Fla., and also won the 
prestigious Golden Cup Supercross in Fukuoka City, Japan, during the 
off-season. Supercross riders will be at Anaheim Stadium on Jan. 29 and Jack 
Murphy Stadium in San Diego on Feb. 5. No races are scheduled this year for 
either the Coliseum or Rose Bowl.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; RUELAS BRUSHES OFF PENDLETON ANTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rafael Ruelas has waited too long for his title chance to be choosy about the 
mental state of the champion he's challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 If Freddie Pendleton is going to act like a screaming clown in the days 
leading up to their World Boxing Council lightweight championship bout Feb. 19 
at the Forum, then Ruelas, the No. 1 contender, says he can handle it. 
</P>
<P>
 Crazy, sane, melancholy, schizophrenic . . . whatever, as long as the fight, 
on the Michael Carbajal-Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez undercard, happens. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton used a news conference earlier this month at the Forum to, at times 
hilariously, at times bizarrely, shout insults at Ruelas and Ruelas' handlers, 
Dan and Joe Goossen, via a phone hookup from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas, 22, based in Sylmar, stood at the podium and repeated one thought back 
to Pendleton: Nothing matters until the fight, and you will not be bellowing 
put-downs when you are on your back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally don't think he's trying to lure me into anything. I think he 
just wants to get me mad so I won't be focused on the plan," Ruelas said 
recently in between workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not going to happen. I'm a very low-key person and I stay 
concentrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas (39-1, with 30 knockouts) was recently named the most powerful puncher 
in the lightweight division by Ring magazine, and he did not deny that he 
relishes the thought of using fists to stop Pendleton from calling him a 
"stiff" again. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton has said he will go for an early knockout against Ruelas, but 
Pendleton is known more for his boxing skills and ability to avoid punches than 
his power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things that he's saying, they are things that do spike you a little," 
Ruelas said. "They get you a little angry, make you feel eager to get in there 
to shut him up. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm aware that I shouldn't react. I should just respond intelligently and 
that's keeping cool and wait until the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aware that he's had a lot of fights. He's a good fighter. He's fast, fast 
on his feet and fast with his hands. I am also aware that he has got a weak 
chin, that he's not the best taking punches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe (the wildness) is typical of him. I've seen him before. I saw him 
at a press conference in July. I knew it's the way it's going to happen. And 
the upcoming press conferences I know will be even more because we'll both be 
there. But that has no effect on the fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton's performance at the news conference, plus the strange result of his 
last nontitle fight in Mexico, have Joe Goossen thinking this is no act. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton, 31, has always been brash through his long pro career (he is 
35-18-1 with 23 KOs after starting 13-13-1). But last month he went into 
uncharted territory. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 4, Pendleton was disqualified after the third round during a nontitle 
fight against Ed Pollard for failing to return to his corner.

 "They made me mad," said Pendleton when asked to explain the events. "I can't 
really explain how they made me mad. There were a lot of infractions by the 
other fighter. Nobody was doing anything to control it, so I controlled it 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton, complaining that Pollard was committing fouls, appeared to take a 
swing at the referee, then, in a tantrum that lasted more than a minute, 
screamed at and shoved his cornermen when they unsuccessfully tried to get him 
to his corner before he was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 "He attacked his own trainers -- did you see what he did to his own trainers?" 
Joe Goossen said. "I wouldn't have anything to do with that guy if he ever put 
his hands on me. He's dead wrong. He's out of his mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen, rarely at a loss for words or a vivid emotion, admits he was a little 
nonplussed about the attacks Pendleton launched at him and his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something about the Goossens you don't like," Pendleton said. 
"They're sort of stuck to boxing like parasites. And they have those hairdos. I 
don't like those hairdos." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Goossen: "I was thinking about it this morning, about Pendleton and the 
talk and the talk. I was thinking, 'What am I going to say when I get to the 
press conference, and I know he's going to direct things at me?' 
</P>
<P>
 "You heard him about my hair and all that. And I know a lot of it is hype, a 
lot of is sell, but I truly believe this guy is just off his rocker." 
</P>
<P>

 Ruelas, on a potential lightweight matchup with Oscar De La Hoya: "Eventually, 
it definitely will happen. I'm not saying it will happen now. He won't fight us 
now. If he keeps winning, and I know I'm going to keep winning . . . it'll be a 
big-money fight." 
</P>
<P>
 There are clauses in the contract De La Hoya recently signed with HBO that 
mandate him fighting for and defending world titles -- which could make a 
challenge for a potential Ruelas WBC lightweight belt inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big difference is he won the gold medal, which is why he gets so 
exposed," Ruelas said of De La Hoya. "But in time, my publicity will come, my 
recognition will come. I think people in the boxing world know who I am." 
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Long-time World Boxing Council junior-lightweight champion Azumah Nelson 
injured his left hand in training, forcing the postponement of his rematch 
against James Leija, scheduled on the Julio Cesar Chavez vs. Frankie Randall 
card next Saturday at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The Nelson fight has been 
replaced with Tommy Hearns against Dan Ward in a cruiserweight bout. There are 
also rumbles that Nelson might retire from boxing before the fight can be 
rescheduled, which should interest Rafael Ruelas' older brother, Gabriel 
Ruelas, who is the No. 1 contender and is due a mandatory title fight by the 
middle of this year. If Nelson retires, a Leija-Ruelas fight for the vacant 
title is likely. . . . Long Beach heavyweight Jeremy Williams, poised to move 
into the division's top 10, is scheduled to fight journeyman Mark Wills on Jan. 
28 at Lewiston, Maine; then 1992 Barcelona Olympian Larry Donald on March 12, 
probably at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. . . . Though nothing is official, it 
appears that International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Assn. heavyweight 
champion Evander Holyfield has given up immediate hopes of fighting WBC 
champion Lennox Lewis and will fight No. 1 contender Michael Moorer in Las 
Vegas in either April or June. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya, whose last fight was Oct. 30, had the cast on his left wrist 
removed Friday and has begun training at Big Bear for his March 5 World Boxing 
Organization junior-lightweight championship fight against Jimmi Bredahl at the 
Olympic Auditorium. Close associates estimate he checked into camp weighing 
about 138, eight pounds over the junior-lightweight limit. . . . De La Hoya has 
finalized his settlement with former managers Bob Mittleman and Steve Nelson 
and signed a five-fight, $7.5-million deal with HBO. One peek into how ugly the 
battle could have gotten if the two sides couldn't come up with a quick 
settlement: In papers filed to the California State Athletic Commission, De La 
Hoya argued that his contract should be nullified because the $60 check 
Mittleman wrote to get his California managing license last year bounced. The 
check was quickly fully funded. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Arum is planning to headline his second card at the Olympic on March 12 
with Azusa junior-welterweight Zack Padilla. . . . The Olympic Auditorium 
suffered no damage in Monday's earthquake, and the refurbishing of the storied 
fight arena continues on pace, according to Steve Needleman, chief executive 
officer of the building. "The place is a rock," Needleman said Tuesday. The 
only pause came Monday and Tuesday when the workers were given time off to be 
with their families. There have been two deliveries of seats, and the 
installation is due to begin this week.

VALLEY DIGEST; NORTHRIDGE'S MICELLI ATTENDING TO FUNERAL PLANS FOR HIS FATHER 
</P>

<P>
 While most Cal State Northridge basketball players were finding other places 
to live Friday in the aftermath of Monday's 6.6 earthquake, center Peter 
Micelli was helping with funeral arrangements for his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Micelli, 50, was found dead in a Camarillo motel room Thursday, the 
victim of an apparent heart attack.A 10 a.m. burial Mass will be held Monday at 
Good Shepard Catholic Church in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli, a prominent lawyer, was among the basketball team's most enthusiastic 
supporters, attending all of the Matadors' games. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart goes out to Peter and his family," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy 
said. "It is crushing to all of us. He was close to the kids and supported 
Peter tremendously. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an extremely giving man. He always looked to help young people and 
people who weren't as fortunate as he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli was on his way to San Francisco to work on a case when he stopped at 
the motel Wednesday night because he was not feeling well, Northridge spokesman 
Barry Smith said. Earlier in the day he stopped at Peter's rented Northridge 
home to drop off food and supplies for students who were staying there after 
being displaced by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli is survived by his wife, Frances, Peter and daughters Pauline and 
Maria. MIKE HISERMAN

 Tailback Brendan Jones of Crescenta Valley High has made an oral commitment to 
attend Washington, his father said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones (5-feet-11, 175 pounds) rushed for 646 yards and three touchdowns in 96 
carries last season to lead the Falcons to an 8-3 record and a second-place 
finish in the Pacific League at 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones canceled recruiting trips to Cal and Hawaii, Mark Jones said.

SANTA ANITA; TRAINER JONES RETURNS IN TIME FOR BEST PAL'S '94 DEBUT TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Gary Jones said he enjoyed his 30-day vacation so much that he was ready to 
take another day off Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fat chance," the trainer said, quickly letting his visitor know he had been 
joking. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after his suspension for a positive drug test from one of his horses 
ended, Jones was in good spirits, relaxed and happy to be back at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Always a high-percentage outfit, the Jones stable flourished while the boss 
was away. Rafael Becerra, Jones' longtime assistant, was the trainer of record 
for the barn during the suspension and had six winners from 28 starters through 
the first 18 days of the meeting. That left him tied with Jack Van Berg atop 
the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get back before these guys took over," Jones said. "My competitors 
are thrilled to see me back because it will get Rafael off their backs. I've 
always given the crew a lot of credit, and they did a great job. I'm real proud 
of everybody. I feel proud and fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Used to working seven days a week, Jones said it took a while to adjust to 
having the time off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started to relax a little (Thursday)," he said, referring to his first day 
back. "Seriously, the way I'm geared, it took me some time to relax, but I 
finally got to where I could. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got too fat. Sitting around doing nothing, (weight) comes on you quick."  
</P>
<P>
 Jones and his wife, Joan, spent time skiing at Lake Tahoe and looking for a 
house in Del Mar, and visited the Texas homes of horse owners Mike Rutherford 
and Art and Jack Preston. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' return coincides with the 1994 debut of Best Pal, in the $158,300 San 
Pasqual Handicap today. The 6-year-old gelding will make his first start since 
a disastrous performance in the Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Supplemented to the Breeders' Cup for $360,000 by owners John and Betty Mabee, 
Best Pal finished 10th at 9-5, beating only Missionary Ridge, Miner's Mark and 
Colonial Affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a combination of a lot of things," Jones said. "He didn't school (in 
the paddock) right the day before and he left grain in his (feed) tub the night 
before, which isn't like him. It wasn't his kind of track that day. It was all 
dug and Laffit (Pincay on Diazo) kept him in tight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing good right now. A mile and a sixteenth is not his ideal distance 
and the rail can be a hassle at that distance, but you have to start somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would assume he would come back in the Santa Anita Handicap (on March 5), 
depending on how he runs (today) and what Mr. Mabee says." 
</P>
<P>
 A winner of five of 11 starts at Santa Anita, Best Pal is the 5-2 favorite for 
the San Pasqual against six opponents. Corey Black will again ride the 
California-bred, who, as the 122-pound highweight, will be spotting from three 
to nine pounds to the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Star Recruit, who lost by a nose to Sir Beaufort in last year's Santa Anita 
Handicap at 59-1, is the 3-1 second choice. The 5-year-old Al Nasr horse made 
his first start since the Big 'Cap on New Year's Eve, finishing third, a neck 
behind Slerp, in the Ack Ack Handicap.  
</P>
<P>
 Ibero, an easy winner of an allowance race last month at Hollywood Park, is 
the 4-1 third choice. Johann Quatz, who will be making his first start on dirt; 
Lottery Winner, Hill Pass and Manny's Prospect are the other entrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to ride three horses Friday, Pat Valenzuela failed to show at Santa 
Anita without notifying the stewards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard nothing," said steward Pete Pedersen. "That's all we can say." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, who has a long history of skipping programs, has struggled through 
the early part of the Santa Anita, winning on only four of 60 mounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedersen said the jockey will have to meet with the stewards before he is 
allowed to ride again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're surprised (by his absence) and anxious to hear what his story is," 
Pedersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier on the card today, Wekiva Springs is the 6-5 favorite in the $79,650 
Santa Catalina Stakes, the first prep for the Santa Anita and Kentucky derbies. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Donald Dizney and trained by Bob Hess Jr., Wekiva Springs is unbeaten 
in two races at 1 1/16 miles, the distance of the Santa Catalina. The Runaway 
Groom colt broke his maiden by 11 lengths, then after being sidelined because 
of a sore hoof, he beat Ferrara by three lengths in an allowance race on Jan. 
3. Kent Desormeaux will ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Dream Trapp, who is perfect in two sprints, is the 2-1 second choice as he 
tries two turns. Duca, a stablemate to Brocco, is the 7-2 third choice and is 
also going for his third consecutive victory. The two other entrants are 
Gracious Ghost and Heavenly Crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robannier, who won the California Juvenile at Bay Meadows on New Year's Day, 
will seek his third consecutive victory in the $200,000 El Camino Real Derby 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The race, which will be simulcast at Santa Anita, also attracted Delineator, 
third at 2-5 in the California Juvenile, Flying Sensation, third in the 
Hollywood Futurity, and Tabasco Cat, who finished third behind Brocco and 
Blumin Affair in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in his most recent start.

KROEGER EMULATES HIS HERO AS AN INTENSE COMPETITOR; BASKETBALL: EDISON SENIOR 
FORWARD WANTS TO PLAY THE GAME AS HARD GOLDEN STATE'S CHRIS WEBBER DOES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Micah Kroeger was just an awe-struck kid back then, one of dozens of 
youngsters at an Eastern Michigan basketball camp whose attention strayed away 
from dribbling drills to catch a glimpse of a rising prep superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was dominating," Kroeger remembers. "Just dominating." 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger moved from Michigan to Huntington Beach four years ago with his 
family, but his memories of Webber's prep days are as vivid as a kid's 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 He spins story after story about Webber's days at Detroit Country Day High and 
later at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories that Kroeger's Edison High teammates have heard dozens of times. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teammates just hate them (Michigan) now," Kroeger said, "because I love 
them so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Kroeger has grown from avid spectator to a pretty good player 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6-foot-6 senior forward, Kroeger leads Edison in scoring (15.9 points) and 
rebounding (7.4). As a junior, he led the Chargers to a 19-9 record and the 
quarterfinals of the Southern Section Division II-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger's outside shooting touch and passing skills made him a natural to play 
swingman in the Chargers' offense. He flourished at the position last season, 
scoring almost at will off the break and by pulling up from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger was free to roam the perimeter because of the dominating presence 
inside of Kyle Murphy, a football lineman turned rebounder and roadblock on 
screens during basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a winning combination. The Chargers finished third in the Sunset League 
behind Huntington Beach and Ocean View but pulled off one of the biggest 
playoff upsets by beating Glendora and star guard Cameron Murray in the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger scored 25 points and pulled down 10 rebounds, and Murphy added 24 
points and eight rebounds as the Chargers held off the Tartans, 70-65, before a 
noisy crowd at the Glendora gym. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory earned the Chargers a spot in the quarterfinals against top-seeded 
Riverside J.W. North and star guard Edward Gray, who signed with Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger kept Edison close early, scoring the Chargers' first nine points 
before Gray got hot from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger led the Chargers with 21 points, but fouled out with 3 minutes 24 
seconds left in the game. Gray finished with 26 points and North coasted to a 
69-47 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy graduated and left Edison with little size inside this season. So 
Kroeger is playing more and more with his back to the basket, a role he hasn't 
exactly been comfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, last week's 52-39 loss to Huntington Beach. Kroeger made 
only two of 12 shots and had fits trying to guard Tony Gonzalez, Huntington 
Beach's burly 6-6 center. Gonzalez outscored Kroeger, 25-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony's unstoppable," Kroeger said. "When he outweighs you by 40 pounds, it's 
tough to stop him." 
</P>
<P>
 Games such as the Huntington Beach loss frustrate Kroeger. Edison (10-5, 3-3) 
has played well at times, but has struggled early in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Larry Hirst, Edison's first-year coach: "Micah is a great player but he 
was a little overanxious to carry the team on his shoulders this season. He has 
been trying hard, though, to mix the physical, mental and emotional parts of 
the game together." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a little bit of Webber has rubbed off on Kroeger. Although nowhere 
near as dominating inside, Kroeger has the intensity to match that of the 
Golden State Warrior rookie's. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger was a terror in the summer leagues, both with officials and his 
teammates. He would yell at teammates if they made a bad pass. He would yell at 
referees about what he thought were bad calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a lot of technical fouls in the summer," he said. "I would just blow 
up, and I knew that was one of my main negative points." 
</P>
<P>
 All that yelling didn't earn him any points with the officials, his teammates 
or his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Micah is so much more dominant than the other kids," Hirst said. "But when 
things weren't going well, he would get on his teammates in a very negative 
way. We had some problems with that in the summer. I would say his playing time 
and his time on the bench were about the same during the summer because of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger went back to the bench early in Edison's season, but for a different 
reason. He sprained his right ankle going for a layup against Capistrano 
Valley. He spent the next four games watching from the bench while the swelling 
went down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough sitting on the bench watching, but I think it really helped me," 
Kroeger said. "It gave me some perspective. I got to see the game in a whole 
new light. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to see how tough it is to call a game (as an official), how difficult 
it is to make every call right. I began to understand that they make mistakes 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger was expected to miss six weeks with the ankle injury, but he was back 
in the lineup in less than three. It's heavily taped, but he insists he can 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still hurting," he said. "But not bad. I'm not going to use it as an 
excuse. Nobody cares to hear about that."

NHL / ALL-STAR GAME NOTES; PLAYERS' GOAL: LOTS MORE GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD and HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You won't find a group less fond of the defensive style suddenly so pervasive 
in the NHL than the All-Stars -- those whose speed and skill the 
defense-oriented teams are trying to neutralize. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo's Alexander Mogilny: "It's terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec's Joe Sakic: "It's been frustrating for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Added St. Louis' Brett Hull: "I think the game is going backward with the 
defensive style teams are playing. I know guys in the stands are paying a 
pretty penny to watch me play. They don't want to see me get checked or Wayne 
Gretzky get checked. They don't want to see a 2-1 game. People want to see 5-5 
or 6-5 in overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 The goals-per-game average is at its lowest in 20 years -- about 6.58 a game 
for both teams combined, down from 7.20 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The various theories include improved goaltending, but focus mostly on the 
spread of the neutral-zone trap, extensive clutching and grabbing that isn't 
being called and a general attempt by less-skilled teams to do anything they 
can to narrow the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 For the skilled players, frustration builds. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Officials) let everything go, and that's why you see one- and two-goal 
games," Mogilny said. "I don't think that's exciting to watch. What do you 
think?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sakic: "There's such a big difference in the way everybody's playing this 
year compared to last year. Everyone gets frustrated when you're not getting 
chances. There've been a lot of games where, because you get frustrated, you 
try to open it up and then you turn the puck over. That's what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are some who think the influence of the neutral-zone trap is 
being over-emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neutral-zone trap?" Gretzky said. "Everybody's talking about it. I still 
haven't figured out what that is, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, hey, you do what you have to do to win. All it takes to sell 
tickets is to win. If that's going to work for San Jose, good for them. If 
that's going to work in Florida, good for them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday night's skills contests, Al Iafrate won hardest shot with a 
102.7-m.p.h. slap shot, Sergei Fedorov won fastest skater, and Brendan Shanahan 
won most accurate shot. Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr suffered an injurd groin and 
his status is undetermined for the game. Patrick Roy and John Vanbiesbrouck 
tied in the goaltending competition. The Western Conference won the overall 
competition, 18-11. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If today's game ends in a tie, the outcome will be determined by a shootout if 
the standard five-minute overtime period ends with the score still deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Score a point for Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner, one of a minority 
of NHL governors who strongly favor adopting shootouts and doing away with ties 
-- and a member of a 10-man committee appointed Friday by Commissioner Gary 
Bettman to study the idea of implementing shootouts.

MIGHTY DUCK NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; NHL TAKES CUE FROM SUCCESS OF DUCKS,

 Alexei Kasatonov looked quite at home in his Western Conference jersey Friday 
after practicing for today's All-Star game at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? It's purple -- just like the Mighty Ducks' road jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Wales and Campbell Conferences relegated to the dustbin, the NHL 
redesigned its All-Star jerseys to reflect the league's new image. And the NHL 
apparently figured if teal and purple colors that fly off shelves and hangers 
on their way to the cash register -- see the San Jose Sharks and Mighty Ducks 
-- they're good enough for the All-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastern Conference is wearing Shark-like teal and the Western is wearing 
purple. 
</P>
<P>
 Purple and teal All-Stars? 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we play like Mighty Ducks," laughed Kasatonov, who said he is proud to 
be representing the 18-27-4 Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an unanticipated honor for Kasatonov, who did not leave the former 
Soviet Union to play in the NHL until he was 31. Though he played in three 
Olympics, winning two gold medals and a silver and has been an all-star at the 
World Championships and the Canada Cup, the NHL All-Star game seemed beyond his 
reach until now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud to be here. It is for my family . . . history," Kasatonov said. 
"And I'm proud to be the first to play for the Mighty Ducks." 
</P>
<P>
 At 34, he is the third-oldest player in this All-Star game, behind the Kings' 
Dave Taylor, 38, and Pittsburgh's Joe Mullen, 36. 
</P>
<P>
 To the young Russian stars who are also playing today, he was a childhood 
hero, and briefly a teammate on the Central Red Army team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to watch him on TV when I was a small kid, 10 years old," said 
Vancouver's Pavel Bure, 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great hockey player," said Buffalo's Alexander Mogilny, 24. "He was a 
great player back in Russia. He put a lot of heart and soul into the Russian 
team. It's great to see a guy like him here." 
</P>
<P>
 Kasatonov is proud of his countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows the true Russian school (of hockey) is really good school," said 
Kasatonov. "I remember Pavel when he was this big, like my son (Leonid, 10)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though this is Kasatonov's first All-Star game, he also was at the 1979 event 
at Madison Square Garden that replaced the NHL All-Star game that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasatonov, then 19, was a member of the Soviet team team that played a team of 
NHL all-stars in the Challenge Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not play -- I was very young," Kasatonov said. "But we won series, 2-1, 
and won the last game, 6-0." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Semenov update: Anatoli Semenov, who was the team's leading scorer when he 
dislocated his elbow when he caught caught in a check by teammate Stu Grimson 
Dec. 7, is being called "probable" for Monday's game against St. Louis at 
Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 If Semenov returns Monday, he will have missed 20 games -- and the Ducks will 
have gone a surprising 9-9-2 without him. A final decision on whether he'll 
play will probably come after Sunday's practice -- the only practice NHL rules 
allow over the All-Star break.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTES; SCHOOL REPORTS MINOR NCAA VIOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton reported one minor NCAA violation in its men's basketball 
program to the Big West Conference several weeks ago, Athletic Director Bill 
Shumard said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans held three team practices before the NCAA's official Oct. 29 start 
date while a student-manager was in the gymnasium. According to NCAA rules, 
there can be no organized practices before the official start date. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have self-reported the issue to our conference office with our suggested 
self-imposed sanctions and we are awaiting a response," Shumard said. "We take 
any potential violation seriously. We look at it thoroughly and report it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Farrell, Big West Commissioner, said he considers the violation to be 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is anything of major importance -- that's the only thing 
I can say at this point," Farrell said. "There were no coaches involved -- 
that's what makes it minor." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton has suggested eliminating three practices this winter to make up for 
the three it held before the Oct. 29 start date. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't speculate as to what my conference committee will do, but in the 
past, it's usually an eye for an eye," Farrell said. "If someone holds two or 
three improper practices, you end up docking a team a like number of practices 
during the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell said he expects the matter to be settled between the conference and 
Fullerton, and he doesn't expect the NCAA to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they review (matters like this), 99.999% of the time they accept what 
the conference has done," Farrell said. 
</P>

 Marci White, the starting third baseman for the last two seasons on the Cal 
State Fullerton softball team, was declared academically ineligible on Friday 
and will miss the entire 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 White, a junior from Long Beach Millikan, twice has been selected to the 
All-West Region second team and as a freshman, she was selected to the All-Big 
West Conference team. She batted .308 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will move Laurie LoForti from second base to third and play Monica 
Bagalayos (a Delta Community College transfer) at second," Coach Judi Garman 
said. "Laurie is an excellent third baseman but we will lose a little 
offensively."

ROSAS HAS NEVER BEEN FAR FROM SPORT SHE LOVES; GYMNASTICS: SAN CLEMENTE HIGH 
GRADUATE QUIT FOUR YEARS AGO BUT NOW IS HAPPY TO BE COMPETING AT UCLA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Misty Rosas was wearing a Donald Duck costume and Peter Pan was telling her 
that she ought to consider going to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Wacky as that sounds, it is lucky for the UCLA women's gymnastics team that 
Rosas decided to heed that advice.  
</P>
<P>
 Rosas, a 20-year-old Bruin freshman, is a former elite gymnast who quit the 
sport four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last 1 1/2 years, she has played characters in the show "Fantasmic" at 
Disneyland. That's where she met Randy Lane, who was playing Peter Pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane, in his second year as a UCLA assistant coach, knew about Rosas' 
gymnastics background and persuaded her to go to UCLA and try out for the 
gymnastics team. 
</P>
<P>
 Once she proved she hadn't lost her skills, co-coaches Valorie Kondos and 
Scott Bull gave her a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rosas is one of the reasons the Bruins are expected to contend for the 
national championship this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we've been given a very precious gift," Kondos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting back into gymnastics has not been easy for Rosas, who once had dreams 
of competing in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12, Rosas moved out of her home near San Juan Capistrano to live and train 
with the Southern California Acro Team under Coach Don Peters in Huntington 
Beach. Three years later, she broke her back while doing a release move on the 
uneven bars. Then she returned to the sport too quickly and her back took a 
long time to heal properly. 
</P>
<P>
 After another year of competing, mostly in pain, Rosas was burned out. She was 
16. 
</P>
<P>
 She left the gym, finished high school at San Clemente High and worked at a 
car dealership before auditioning for a part in "Fantasmic." But she never 
completely got away from the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed it a lot," Rosas said. "I would fool around with friends that were 
either stunt people or gymnasts and we would condition and work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosas has the work ethic of an elite gymnast, which is what kept her in good 
enough shape to return to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is one of these people that when you say, 'OK, do one more,' she does 
five more," Kondos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosas maintained her flexibility through dance and increased her strength in 
her legs through aerobic dancing and running. She has regained her skill in 
tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean that getting up on a narrow balance beam and doing flips 
-- flips she used to do so easily -- does not scare her. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she often thinks, "I'm back up here again doing this? I was scared 
before and I'm scared now." 
</P>
<P>
 But the most difficult hurdle facing Rosas at UCLA is not in the gym, but in 
the classroom. She did not go through a traditional high school education 
because she studied with tutors at SCATS and completed most of her work at San 
Clemente through independent studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely going to be a struggle," Rosas said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosas, who is 4-feet-8, thrives on challenges and the element of danger. 
She once jumped off a two-story house and landed on a foam mat, just for fun. 
Thrill-seeking is partly what led her to return to gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how it is going to be my whole life, I guess."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; TEMBLOR EXPECTED TO ROCK SOUTHLAND'S TOURISM; 
L.A., ORANGE COUNTIES COULD LOSE BILLIONS AS WARY VISITORS SHY AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A new aftershock of the Northridge earthquake hit Friday as economists at 
Chapman University predicted a major drop in tourism that could cost Los 
Angeles and Orange counties as much as $4.6 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been expecting 5% increases in tourism spending in each county for 
1994, but that was before Monday's earthquake," said Esmael Adibi, director of 
the private university's Center for Economic Research. 
</P>
<P>
 A revised forecast now calls for a 10% to 20% drop in Los Angeles tourism and 
a 5% to 10% drop in Orange County, he said. San Francisco tourism dropped by 
15% the year after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake rocked the Bay Area, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any anticipated economic benefit for Southern California from new construction 
activity in the wake of Monday's quake, Adibi said, will be erased by the 
losses sustained by people who had no earthquake insurance and are not able to 
obtain government aid to repair quake damage to their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapman economics center estimated total physical damage from the 
magnitude 6.6 quake at a minimum of $7.8 billion, and Adibi estimated that no 
more than half will be covered by insurance or government grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The drops in tourism -- which is a $20-billion annual industry in Los Angeles 
County and adds $6 billion a year to Orange County's economy -- will come 
because of people's perception of Southern California as an unsafe area, Adibi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined impact of the earthquake, last fall's wildfires and the 1992 Los 
Angeles riots "have such a great and lasting psychological impact on people 
that it will affect tourism dramatically," he said. "Unlike the recent 
wildfires, which have a slim chance of occurring again, earthquakes can happen 
at any time, and that may keep people away." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman economists were not able to project regional tourism job losses. Adibi 
said the estimated loss of $2 billion to $4 billion in Los Angeles County and 
$300 million to $600 million in Orange County would come from a combination of 
reduced tourist spending and local employment cuts at hotels, restaurants, 
amusement parts and other tourist venues.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; 7-ELEVEN CUTTING FRANCHISES OVER PRICE GOUGING; 
PARENT COMPANY CITES OVERCHARGING AT EIGHT LOCATIONS IN THE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The parent of 7-Eleven Stores said Friday that it is terminating franchise 
agreements with operators of eight San Fernando Valley stores for overcharging 
victims of Monday's devastating quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based Southland Corp. said employees, which the chain sent out as 
undercover shoppers, were charged inflated prices for food, water, batteries 
and cigarettes at the stores. The company dispatched the undercover shoppers to 
its nearly 100 stores in the Valley -- all franchise operations -- in response 
to mounting consumer complaints about post-quake price gouging at the 
convenience store chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "7-Eleven does not condone or tolerate this kind of behavior," said Terry 
Blocher, general manager of 7-Eleven Stores for the Los Angeles region. "We are 
working quickly to resolve the situation and deal firmly with the individuals 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Blocher said the company has turned over the results of its investigation to 
the Los Angeles city attorney's office, which is conducting its own 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Blocher declined to identify the stores where alleged price gouging occurred 
or to name the franchisees. "Emotions are running high with people losing 
homes," Blocher said. "We have a concern for their safety." 
</P>
<P>
 The unusually severe step by 7-Eleven came as more than 20 city and county law 
enforcement officials on Friday delivered hearing notices to more than 100 San 
Fernando Valley merchants accused of jacking up prices after the quake in 
violation of a year-old city ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city attorney finds evidence of gouging at the hearing, the matter may 
be referred for criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said complaints about gouging continued to pour into its 
earthquake fraud hot line Friday. Since its inception late Tuesday, the hot 
line has taken more than 400 calls about alleged overcharging. The incidents 
have occurred mostly at neighborhood liquor stores, convenience stores and gas 
stations, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think most of the complaints have some basis in fact," said Ted Goldstein, 
a spokesman for the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least some of the complaints seemed to result more from sticker shock 
over higher convenience store prices than from actual gouging. A reporter's 
survey of more than two dozen convenience stores in Reseda, Van Nuys and North 
Hollywood found wide variances in prices among stores, but no clear cases of 
gouging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, people used to shopping at a mass merchandiser may not be 
familiar with convenience store retail prices," said Margaret Chabris, a 
7-Eleven spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 At the intersection of Tampa Avenue and Saticoy Street in Reseda, for example, 
a Lucky supermarket charged $1.05 for a gallon of water, while a 7-Eleven 
charged $1.29 for a gallon and $1.39 for a designer 1.5-liter bottle, or less 
than a half-gallon. Those were the chain's everyday prices. 
</P>
<P>
 7-Eleven is not the only company to guard against price gouging. Arco, also 
the target of such allegations, this week sent letters to its dealers warning 
that overcharging could result in cancellation of a dealer's franchise 
agreement. An Arco spokeswoman said supervisors are monitoring prices at its 
more than 170 gas stations in the Valley but have found no cases of 
overcharging. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in San Fernando have accused an Arco dealer in that city of doubling 
gasoline prices after the quake, but the company is disputing the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 7-Eleven's Blocher said employees were sent to stores with specific shopping 
lists that included water, juice, batteries and cigarettes. In one case, an 
undercover shopper was charged $3.99 for a box of Lucky Charms cereal that 
usually retails for $2.99. In another case, an undercover shopper paid $2.50 
for a bottle of water that cost $1.35 before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Blocher said franchisees accused of overcharging have been with the company 
between six and 12 years. He said they have 30 days to leave the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect that some will fight it and others won't," he said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; STATE FARM BAN ON NEW QUAKE POLICIES PROMPTS 
REBUKE BY GARAMENDI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi blasted State Farm Insurance on Friday 
for imposing a moratorium on earthquake insurance coverage over a vast area of 
California that stretches as far away as Tuolumne County. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi called the moratorium "blatantly illegal" and said he will take 
action to rescind it. He did not specify what action he is contemplating. 
</P>
<P>
 Other insurers have also imposed moratoriums, but apparently none apply to as 
large an area as State Farm's. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm, California's largest homeowners insurer with nearly 25% of the 
market, defended the moratorium as within the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Cooley, legislative counsel for State Farm, said California law 
permits insurers to refrain from offering earthquake insurance to new customers 
for up to 60 days after an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the ban extends up to 250 miles and affects cities as distant as 
Modesto, Cooley said State Farm intended it to include not just areas directly 
affected by Monday's Northridge quake but also those places with "significant 
seismicity." 
</P>
<P>
 The moratorium, imposed Wednesday, covers 18 counties, including much of the 
California-Nevada border and the Central Valley, as well as Southern 
California. However, it does not include San Diego County, parts of which have 
felt tremors from this week's quake and aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not permit the insurer of one in four California homeowners to impose 
a blanket and open-ended moratorium in areas wholly unaffected by the Los 
Angeles earthquake," Garamendi said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There shall be no moratoriums in those specific areas where earthquake 
aftershocks are not occurring," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Garamendi's objection is that State Farm did not specify the duration 
of the moratorium, saying only that "past moratoriums have generally lasted 30 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooley said State Farm does not expect the ban to last even 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate, the second-largest carrier with 16% of the California market, has 
imposed a moratorium on the area within a 100-mile radius of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Donegan, regional underwriting manager, said Allstate was ready to lift 
its moratorium Friday, but strong aftershocks and reports of new damage 
prompted it to keep the ban in force. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers Insurance Group, No. 3 in California, has a moratorium that covers 
"the affected area," spokesman Jeffrey Beyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like State Farm, neither Allstate nor Farmers set specific terms for the 
moratoriums.

PARAMOUNT, IN FLIP-FLOP, BACKS VIACOM OFFER; MERGERS: BOARD SAYS IT WILL 
TERMINATE EXISTING DEAL WITH QVC NETWORK. QVC CAN STILL MAKE A NEW OFFER, BUT 
ITS ADVISERS ARE LIVID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The board of Paramount Communications Inc. on Friday reversed itself and 
unanimously endorsed the revised tender offer of Viacom Inc. as the best deal 
for its shareholders, adding that it would terminate its existing merger 
agreement with QVC Network Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The move now puts Viacom in the lead in the 19-week battle for Paramount and 
increases pressure on QVC Chairman Barry Diller to make a new offer, Wall 
Street traders said. Indeed, sources said, QVC was planning a new offer before 
the latest Paramount flip-flop. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC advisers, however, were steaming Friday evening and said their client 
might decide to drop out of the bidding altogether. Diller was not immediately 
available for comment, but one close adviser said anger was widespread in the 
QVC camp, which believes it still has the higher bid on the table and has not 
been "treated properly." 
</P>
<P>
 That threat evoked disbelief in the Viacom camp. "I don't believe it for a 
second," said one executive, who speculated that "they're trying to support 
their stock without putting in" guarantees that Paramount shareholders will be 
compensated if the acquiring company's stock loses value after the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 The move by Paramount's board surprised some observers, who at most expected 
the board to declare itself neutral on two bids that are exceedingly close. 
After the board was rebuked by two Delaware courts for failing to consider 
QVC's unsolicited bids last fall, it has shown no overt favoritism to Viacom, 
despite the fact that the two companies signed a friendly merger agreement in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement was scrapped in December in favor of QVC, which made the 
highest bid when an auction of the company began. 
</P>
<P>
 And in January, Viacom Chief Executive Frank Biondi Jr. was heralded as the 
future chief executive if Viacom acquired Paramount -- an abandonment of the 
earlier plan to have Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis serve in that capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Davis left the door open for an improved bid from 
QVC, noting that Paramount's auction rules will allow increased bids through 
the end of the bidding process on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision rests with shareholders, who will determine the winner by 
tendering it 50.1% of their Paramount shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Friday's board meeting, QVC had alerted Paramount that it was preparing 
to sweeten its bid, QVC and Paramount sources agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave (Paramount) specifics on how we're going to improve our bid. We're 
going to do much more to create value," the QVC adviser fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 But QVC's willingness to raise its own bid undermines its argument that it was 
the high bidder, critics said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Paramount's advisers studied the offers, one source said, "it was a very 
close call." Viacom's offer is "marginally superior, but there is enough 
daylight there that we were comfortable" recommending it, he said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on recent market trading, QVC argued that its offer is $554 million 
higher than the Viacom bid, while Viacom advisers presented their bid as most 
favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom's revised offer contains nearly $900 million more cash than QVC's bid, 
but QVC has offered a greater package of securities in the "back end" of its 
two-tiered offer. With its latest bid, Viacom has agreed to provide Paramount 
shareholders some protection if the value of Viacom shares trades below 
expectations a year or two after a merger. For these reasons, a number of Wall 
Street traders said Viacom gained the upper hand this week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Viacom said its bid was worth $83.49 per share, or nearly $10.3 
billion, while QVC said its offer was worth $87.07 per share, or about $10.7 
billion.

 According to the source close to Paramount, the Viacom bid measured more 
favorably on every index except one: recent stock market values, which 
determine the value of the securities offered in the two-tier tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the "winner's paradox," the company that is perceived to be winning the 
auction loses ground on the stock market because its stock is expected to 
plummet if it wins Paramount and assumes more debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom's stock fell after it revised its bid Tuesday, while QVC shares 
climbed. 
</P>
<P>
 The board made its announcement after the close of trading Friday. Paramount 
rose 25 cents to close at $79.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom Class A shares closed unchanged at $40, while Viacom Class B stock rose 
12.5 cents to close at $37.75. QVC closed unchanged at $44.

 Anticipating months -- if not years -- of nightmare commuting from the 
Antelope Valley to construction jobs around the Southland, 30-year-old Jeff 
Thompson spent Friday morning at Palmdale Honda, inspecting rows of gleaming 
new motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a single parent, and I don't want to be away from my child that long," 
said Thompson, currently working on a job in Beverly Hills, 75 miles from home. 
"And if the road's blocked, you can get out on the land or get on the 
shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 Or sweep down the white line, between exasperated drivers sweating long 
backups in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Many share Thompson's thinking. Motorcycle shops in the San Fernando, Simi, 
Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys are reporting a sharp jump in business, both 
for new and used bikes and for batteries and other parts to tune up the 
motorcycles parked in so many Southern California garages. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Lilley, owner of Palmdale Honda, said that while he normally sells 
perhaps 20 bikes a month during the winter, he has been selling 20 a day since 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time of year, we're usually going out for coffee, because there's 
nothing to do," Lilley said, pointing to his quickly thinning ranks of $5,000 
bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the new easy riders are commuters in Santa Clarita, Palmdale and 
Lancaster now separated from Los Angeles by fractured freeways and a bottleneck 
commute. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time of the year, we'd sell eight or nine a week, and we've sold 
probably close to 40 bikes since Tuesday," said Dick Allen, owner of Dick Allen 
Yamaha Honda Kawasaki in Newhall. "I haven't talked to anybody who wasn't 
buying them to make the commute to the San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers on the other end of the commute are also seeing a big jump in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're swamped right now," said Mike Unger, a salesman at Honda, BMW, Sea-Doo 
of North Hollywood. "We have a lot of people from the Santa Clarita Valley 
buying motorcycles. . . . We haven't even counted right now, but it's more than 
double what we do this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The surging interest extends to motorcycle repair operations and accessory 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are saying, 'Hey, I'm going to start taking my bike in,' " Pete 
Berteit said, working the parts counter at Lancaster Harley-Davidson. "We've 
had an increase in sales of warm clothing, the chaps and gloves. We're starting 
to get a run on that now." 
</P>
<P>
 Adventurous commuters with an eye on their wallets are also looking for used 
bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat and David Nagel of Canyon Country picked up a 1984 Honda Magna street bike 
-- with only 2,000 miles of wear -- for $2,000 at Palmdale Honda. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat, 42, and David, 43, both teach at San Fernando Middle School in San 
Fernando, and they plan to weave the lanes to work together. Though David 
hasn't been on a motorcycle for a while, Pat expressed confidence during the 
test ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked good coming out of the lot, so I guess I'll trust him," she said. 
"And we got good helmets." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, several dealers found themselves discouraging potential customers who 
lacked motorcycling experience. According to the latest figures from the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the motorcycle fatality rate is 
20 times that of passenger cars. 
</P>
<P>
 And the California Highway Patrol has a few thoughts of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane splitting -- riding between the lanes of traffic -- is allowed under 
state law as long as it's done safely. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if the traffic is going 20 miles an hour and you're going through at 50 
miles an hour," any nearby officer is likely to pull you over, said Steve 
Kohler, a spokesman at CHP headquarters in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting off other drivers, rapid lane changes and other high-risk maneuvers 
will also draw the CHP's wrath. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of this daunts Kevin Leewitt, 22, a seaman who commutes 150 miles three 
times a week from his Antelope Valley home to the Seafarers Union office in San 
Pedro. Leewitt has ridden dirt bikes for years and downplays the dangers. 
"You've just got to watch what you're doing," he said, admiring a $3,500 used 
Yamaha at Palmdale Honda. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Lilley says many buyers have wanted a motorcycle for some time and are 
using the quake to justify their decision to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no logic to what they're buying," said Lilley, explaining that most 
customers want sporty dual-use bikes that can be used off-highway as well as on 
-- but aren't well suited to long highway commutes. "They're fulfilling a 
fantasy."

$90.7-MILLION PRUDENTIAL PACT WITH INVESTORS WINS JUDGE'S APPROVAL; COURTS: THE 
SETTLEMENT, COVERING 114,000 OF THOSE WHO SUED THE FIRM, ENDS A LARGE PART OF 
THE SECURITIES FRAUD SCANDAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A federal judge called an end to one big part of Prudential Securities Inc.'s 
limited partnership scandal Friday, approving a $90.7-million class-action 
settlement for a large group of investors, though he said he would have wanted 
them to get more. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Marcel Livaudais Jr. approved Prudential's settlement with 
the roughly 114,000 investors in the Energy Income Funds oil and gas limited 
partnerships who remained in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 About 130,000 mainly elderly investors put $1.44 billion into the partnerships 
from 1983 to 1990, with the vast majority suffering heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly three days of hearings, Livaudais surprised lawyers by approving 
the settlement from the bench. Stuart C. Goldberg, an Austin, Tex., lawyer who 
was the last main foe of the settlement, had argued that investors deserved far 
more -- about $780 million -- because of evidence of "deliberate, premeditated, 
systemic securities fraud" by the nation's fourth-largest brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But Livaudais noted that under federal law, he had the authority only to 
approve or disapprove the settlement, not to dictate changes. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that the overall settlement package is far more generous than 
one he derailed a year ago -- and that many investors are anxious to receive 
their money. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the judge said he would have liked Prudential to pay more, he added 
that he had to take into account the possibility that investors might lose if 
the case went to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential lawyer Scott Muller had made clear that if Livaudais rejected the 
settlement, Prudential was prepared to wage an all-out legal battle to deny all 
the investors' claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have no choice but to fight it, and fight it with every resource 
that we have available," Muller said in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said he had not yet decided whether to appeal the judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential says the settlement means investors will end up with, on average, 
about 88 cents for every dollar they invested, including proceeds from last 
year's sale of the partnerships to Parker & Parsley Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
 But some state regulators have said that many individual investors will 
receive much less. And Goldberg noted that the $90.7 million -- about a third 
of which will go to attorneys' fees and expenses -- is far less than the 
commissions and fees Prudential charged the investors, an estimated $388 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased to have achieved another important step in putting the 
partnership problems of the '80s behind us," Prudential Securities President 
and Chief Executive Hardwick Simmons said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential's legal problems are not over, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Vianale, a New York-based federal prosecutor who is conducting a 
criminal investigation of Prudential Securities and its parent, was present 
throughout the hearings as a spectator. He was accompanied by postal inspectors 
who are helping in the inquiry. Thousands of Prudential limited partnership 
investors are also pursuing arbitration claims against the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony Friday on behalf of aggrieved investors, William F. Jordan, a 
Florida State University accounting professor, said Prudential had issued false 
prospectuses, lied about how much of investors' money actually went to buy 
properties and returned investors' money to them disguised as profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential witnesses disputed the allegations.

PHIL & JIM'S CHAIN FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY TO REORGANIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The long-established Phil & Jim's electronics and appliance chain, with debts 
that exceed its assets by nearly $9 million, filed a petition Friday to protect 
itself from creditors while it reorganizes its finances under federal 
bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-year-old Anaheim company's petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa 
Ana lists debts of $16 million, about $8.9 million of it secured, and assets of 
$7.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapter 11 petition was filed as the company prepares for a liquidation 
sale that begins today in five stores that remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 Company lawyers said manufacturers are supporting the Phil & Jim's liquidation 
sale, which will offer discounts of 7% to 50% on all merchandise that was at 
five other stores the company closed this week. Many items will be sold below 
wholesale prices, with manufacturers absorbing the differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The merchandise was moved to remaining stores in Anaheim, Anaheim Hills, Lake 
Forest, Huntington Beach and Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also is slashing overhead and expects to reduce its staff of 180 
to fewer than 80 employees, said Phil Delgado Jr., company president. Barely 
four years ago, the chain had about 400 employees at 12 stores in four 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 William N. Lobel, an Irvine bankruptcy lawyer for the company, said Phil & 
Jim's simply grew too quickly and became too far-flung as it competed against 
large chains like Circuit City. While it matched the big chains' prices, he 
said, the public gravitated to the large discounters because they anticipated 
cheaper prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going to happen in the next few weeks is that Circuit City is going to 
take it in the shorts," Lobel said, referring to the big chain's promise to 
match all advertised prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy petition lists 130,000 unsecured creditors with potential 
claims of $2.2 million. Most are customers who took out extended warranties 
that the company itself offered on electronics and appliances. For now, the 
company no longer offers extended warranties. About $4.8 million more is owed 
to 338 manufacturers and other vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest chunk of secured debt, $8.7 million, is owed mainly to Whirlpool, 
General Electric Capital Corp. and Maytag Corp.

 Judge Backs Aetna on Huge Military Contract: A federal judge gave Aetna Life & 
Casualty Co. the green light to take over a health care contract for 800,000 
military dependents and retirees in California and Hawaii on Feb. 1.Foundation 
Health Corp. and QualMed Inc., rivals for the bitterly contested $3.5-billion 
contract, had asked a federal court in Virginia for an injunction barring Aetna 
from proceeding. When the five-year contract was awarded in July, Foundation 
and QualMed objected that the bids were improperly evaluated. The Pentagon 
agreed and decided to rebid the contract by next July 31, but in the interim 
ordered Aetna to proceed with the first year of the contract as scheduled.

DOW BREAKS 3,900 BARRIER; BOND YIELDS UP

<P>
 Market Overview * The Dow Jones industrial average punched through 3,900 on 
Friday, ending above the milestone for the first time in a rally fueled by 
heavy options trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond yields rose on fears of inflation and speculation that Japanese 
investors would take profits. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow rose 22.52 points to 3,914.48, a new high. It rose 47.28 points in the 
week. It was the blue-chip index's ninth new high of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial stocks were favored at the expense of financial and utility shares, 
analysts said. That was reflected in the broader market, where losing issues 
edged out gainers 1,060 to 973. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite closed at its second straight record high, rising 1.25 
points to 794.28. 
</P>
<P>
 Volume, which has almost consistently been over 300 million per session since 
New Year's Day, was 343.6 million on the New York Stock Exchange. The 
expiration of January options helped send volume soaring, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow's climb continued to defy those on Wall Street warning it was setting 
itself up for a fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sign of the end of this relentless climb up the wall of worry," 
said Anthony Hitschler, president of Brandywine Asset Management Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterpillar helped propel the Dow, rising 4 5/8 to 98 5/8 after reporting 
better than expected quarterly earnings and projecting a higher profit in 1994. 
Bethlehem Steel gained 1 1/8 to 23 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 While investors continued to plow money into stocks expected to benefit from 
the economic recovery -- so-called cyclical stocks -- some analysts expressed 
concern over the market's overall mixed tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple Computer reported earnings above Wall Street's consensus forecast and 
the stock jumped 3 1/2 to 33 3/8. Other computer makers showed strength, 
including Compaq, up 2 3/4 to 82 1/2, and Hewlett Packard, which added 1 5/8 to 
84 3/4. Silicon Graphics advanced 2 to 24 7/8 after reporting a rise in 
quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Dynamics fell 2 1/4 to 92 1/4. Cowen & Co. downgraded its rating on 
the stock. The company said it was disappointed that Sweden rejected its M-1A2 
Abrams tank in favor of the German Leopard tank. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas markets, London's FTSE 100 index gained 14.2 points to 3484.2, up 
83.6 points in the week. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average closed up 123.51 points 
at 19,307.43, a rise of 333.73 from last week. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields rose on fears that Japanese investors would take profits after the 
government's reform bill was defeated in the Upper House of Parliament on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.28%, up from 6.27% 
at Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
 Astrid Adolfson, economist at MCM MoneyWatch, said that if the Japanese stock 
market takes a nose dive Monday, investors in Tokyo could take profits on their 
U.S. Treasury bond holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar rose to 111.57 Japanese yen and 1.7524 German marks in late New 
York trading, from 111.37 yen and 1.7375 marks Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 At New York's Commodity Exchange, March silver fell 15.3 cents to $5.122 an 
ounce. February gold dropped $6.20 to $381.70 an ounce, the lowest price in 
more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold prices rose to a high of $407 an ounce in late July based on perceptions 
that the stock and bond markets had peaked and inflation pressures might 
reignite. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy prices stabilized after a hectic week generated by an Arctic cold mass 
that froze the eastern half of the nation. February heating oil firmed 0.07 
cent to 48.03 cents a gallon, while February natural gas lost 9.5 cents to 
$8.56 per 1,000 cubic feet. March crude oil declined 2 cents to $14.94 a barrel 
and February unleaded gas rose 0.10 cent to 42.04 cents a gallon.

CHINA TO LET FOREIGN BANKS TRADE IN 'PEOPLE'S MONEY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what U.S. officials consider one of the strongest and firmest recent 
demonstrations of China's move toward a capitalist economy, the government said 
Friday that it will allow foreign banks to conduct business in the Chinese 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, a measure of China's seemingly insatiable appetite for foreign 
investment, means U.S. financial institutions and others will be allowed, on a 
limited basis, to accept deposits and make loans -- for home mortgages, car 
purchases or business investment, for example -- in renminbi, the "people's 
money" used within China. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said China will expand the 
number of cities in which foreign financial institutions will be allowed to 
operate, beyond the 13 locations now open to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion of foreign financial operations was portrayed by the Chinese 
finance minister as an experiment and by the United States as a major step and 
a breakthrough in China's march toward economic modernization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese disclosed the measures to U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
during the first meeting of the U.S.-Chinese Joint Economic Committee since 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The banking decisions will allow foreign financial institutions to increase 
their business in China, moving from limited operations involved with foreign 
trade to the commercial operations of banks throughout the industrialized 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more far-reaching, it is expected that the new moves will help streamline 
the financial operations of foreign companies in China -- construction firms 
and exporters, for example. This should make it easier to make payments in 
renminbi without having to engage in repeated transactions.

 Rockwell May Supply Parts to Russian Airliners: The aerospace company is 
taking part in a program to supply parts to a fleet of Russian airliners in a 
deal that its partner says could be worth $1 billion.Government officials 
disclosed that Connecticut-based Pratt & Whitney has begun a $1-million 
feasibility study to determine whether it can supply engines to outfit 20 
Russian Ilyushin 96-M passenger jets. Seal Beach-based Rockwell International 
Corp.'s Collins Air Transport division has been participating in the program 
since October, 1991. Collins, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, would provides avionics, 
or navigation and control systems, for the aircraft. Fifteen other firms are 
participating in the study.

 Japan Surplus Sets Record: The surplus, a chronic sore spot in Japan's 
economic relationship with the rest of the world, soared to $120.40 billion 
last year, the Finance Ministry reported. The 12.9% increase over the 1992 
level came despite a sharp rise in the value of the yen, which tends to weaken 
sales of Japanese exports and increase sales of more affordable foreign goods 
in Japan. Japan's trade surplus with the United States registered a third 
straight increase in 1993, rising 15.2% to $50.19 billion.

 TCI Delays Buying Converter Boxes: The nation's largest cable TV company said 
it will delay for a year the purchase of 1 million set-top boxes that turn a TV 
into a two-way communications device.The delay is not significant in its 
development of more powerful communications networks, Tele-Communications Inc. 
said. But it shows the technical difficulties in developing even the simplest 
of advanced communications products, video on demand. Set-top boxes are 
changing from simply handling numerous cable channels to understanding the 
digital language of computers and processing programs, data services and phone 
calls. In time, the advanced features in such a box will be incorporated into 
TVs.

DOW BREAKS 3,900 BARRIER; BOND YIELDS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * The Dow industrials punched through 3,900 on Friday, ending 
above that mark for the first time in a rally fueled by options trading. The 
broad market was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond yields inched up, while gold tumbled for a second day. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow, which meandered in a narrow range for much of the day, soared in the 
final minutes to close up 22.52 points at 3,914.48, a new high and the first 
close above 3,900. 
</P>
<P>
 But the blue-chip Dow stocks were much more buoyant than the broad market: 
Losers edged winners on the New York Stock Exchange, and major market indexes 
such as the NYSE composite and the Standard & Poor's 500 were slightly lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq market of smaller stocks, however, rose with the Dow: Nasdaq 
winners beat losers 14 to 11, and the market index hit a record 794.28, up 1.25 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many Wall Streeters were unimpressed with stocks' advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a no-fun kind of a rally. The Dow is making new highs but the 
rest of the market is so-so," said Don Hays, strategist at Wheat First-Butcher 
& Singer.  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that the Dow's late surge Friday was tied in part to a flood of 
buy orders associated with the monthly expiration of options on individual 
stocks and on stock indexes. That kind of trading is technical in nature, 
rather than driven by stock fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
 NYSE volume, swelled by options trades, hit 344 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, some analysts said the Dow, which gained 47.28 points for the week, 
may be a more accurate gauge of market sentiment than its critics will allow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market has finished on a very strong note in recent sessions, and that 
underscores a high level of investor confidence," said Eugene Peroni, analyst 
at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Strong earnings reports helped boost industrial stocks, led by Caterpillar, 
which surged 4 5/8 to a record 98 5/8 on its fourth-quarter report. Other 
industrial winners included Bethlehem Steel, up 1 1/8 to 23 5/8; GM, up 3/4 to 
60 7/8, and USX-U.S. Steel, up 1 1/2 to 45. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple Computer helped pace the Nasdaq market rally after reporting earnings 
ahead of expectations. It shot up 3 1/2 to 33 3/8. Also rising among tech 
issues were BMC Software, up 3 1/4 to 63, and Compaq, up 2 5/8 to 82 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earnings disappointments clipped Computer Associates, down 3 to 38; Pairgain 
Technologies, down 2 to 11 1/2, and discount retailer Mac Frugal's Bargains, 
down 3 1/8 to 14 3/8. Mac Frugal's blamed weak Christmas sales and the 
earthquake's effects. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some Southland S&L shares dipped on worries about possible new loan 
write-offs tied to the earthquake. Great Western fell 1 1/8 to 18 5/8, H.F. 
Ahmanson sank 3/4 to 18 5/8 and FirstFed eased 1/2 to 15 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * RHI Entertainment, a major producer of TV movies, surged 2 3/8 to 29 on 
rumors it will be acquired by media mogul Ted Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas markets, London's FTSE-100 index gained 14.2 points to a record 
3,484.2, while Frankfurt's DAX index tumbled 40.59 points to 2,075.61. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei added 123.51 points to 19,307.43. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa rose 27.11 points to 2,683.18, just shy of the 
record 2,684.17 set Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields were slightly higher on fears that Japanese investors could dump 
U.S. bonds on Monday to raise cash, if Tokyo stocks plummet. In a surprise, the 
Japanese government's political reform bill was defeated in the upper house of 
Parliament late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond closed at 6.28%, up from 6.27% on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, gold futures plunged $6.20 to $381.70 an ounce on New York's Comex, 
after Thursday's $4.80-an-ounce slide, as profit takers swarmed. Rumors of 
large gold supplies ready to be dumped on the market pulled prices down. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver also slumped, losing 15.3 cents to $5.12 an ounce.

PACKARD BELL EMPLOYEES GIVEN 2 WEEKS TO DECIDE ON LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 420 Packard Bell employees still reeling from Monday's earthquake 
received another jolt Friday when company officials told them they would be 
laid off in two weeks -- unless they accepted an earlier offer to take a pay 
cut of up to 30% and move to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hlavac, the Packard Bell vice president who signed the termination 
notices, declined to say how many employees refused to relocate and were being 
laid off. The termination notices blamed the sudden layoffs on quake damage 
suffered by the personal computer manufacturer's service center facility in 
Chatsworth, which fields phone calls from customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It couldn't have come at a worse time for many of us," said Greg Black, 39, a 
one-year Packard Bell employee. "I mean, right in the middle of all that is 
happening to us already." 
</P>
<P>
 The company also has plans to move its 1,100-employee headquarters out of 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us we would have to take pay cuts because the cost of living is 
lower in Utah. But it's just wage busting," said Black, who lives in Chatsworth 
with his wife and two young children. "My cut would be almost 25%, but some 
people are losing 30% in pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Service center employees received a letter from Hlavac dated Jan. 10 that said 
the pay cuts are justified because of "a lower cost of living in Utah, lower 
sales taxes in Utah and reduced state income taxes."  
</P>
<P>
 The letter promised bonuses of $75 a week until their termination for 
employees who chose not to relocate. Many expected to continue working until 
March. Instead, the workers got two weeks' notice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Blake, 44, said he was told he would have to take a pay cut from 
$11.18 an hour to $8.50 an hour if he moved to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, the Canoga Park man has been living with his wife and two 
children in a tent outside their damaged home. When Blake was notified of his 
impending layoff, his wife was at home, awaiting the arrival of a city building 
inspector who was to decide if the house was habitable.

COMMENTARY; L.A. SYMBOL NEEDS HEART, NOT 'STEEL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week the Los Angeles City Council abandoned a plan to erect a design for 
a grand downtown monument straddling the Hollywood freeway. This week a 
historic and terrifying earthquake rattled Lotusland like a puppy shaking a 
sock. There was a certain symmetry to the events. 
</P>
<P>
 The monument's architect was Hani Rashid. It involved a series of horizontal 
skeletal spans and stairways whose industrial delicacy earned it the sobriquet 
"The Steel Cloud." Nice title anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Local boosters who fostered this folly envisioned it to become the town's 
permanent trademark monument, the symbol that would say "L.A." to the world. 
Our Eiffel Tower. Our Statue of Liberty. I lift my lamp beside the padlocked 
gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Freud's shade would certainly see it as a bad case of erection envy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody wants to squelch civic enthusiasm in a precinct so short on it. But it 
is a matter of considerable wonder that -- even in its present after-shocked 
state -- this place remains blind to its own uniqueness. There is no such thing 
as permanent around here. L.A. is the capital of the Ephemeral Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 People who are bothered by this say it's because Angeltown has no sense of 
history or because the fickle nature of the movie industry rubs off on us. 
</P>
<P>
 That is backward. It is the fundamental sense of the facts we live with that 
rubs off on history. Our riots, brush fires and temblors make the Icarus myth 
part of our reality. Living with them requires a combination of steely cool and 
a certain lightness of touch. Behind the facade of the Angeltown airhead lurks 
the guy who knows that nothing lasts and everybody dies. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake smashed a lot of bric-a-brac at my house, including three of 
four lovely dessert plates my 77-year-old dad gave me last Christmas. Decorated 
with vintage-type faces, each spelled out an encouraging word like "Love" or 
"Pleasure." It was exactly right that the surviving plate was "Laughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Real Angelenos are people who love the anonymity of a great city where the 
isolation of the automobile guarantees everybody the privacy to invent his own 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A.'s civic structure is that of a dropped egg the size of a small planet. 
Since nobody can see its edges, everybody cooks up their own symbols. Sunny 
side up. Omelette. Benedict. Certainly decidedly scrambled. 
</P>
<P>
 Our image is so amorphous that Mid-Western Angeltown dreamers envision 
Disneyland even though it's in Orange County. Others see Las Vegas neon or 
Santa Barbara mansions. If that's their perfect California dreamin', what's the 
harm? 
</P>
<P>
 In such a solipsistic environment anything of particular personal significance 
becomes the central symbol of L.A. When I was a scruffy kid growing up in the 
bowels of downtown, mine was the sign designating my street. I lived on Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, still fond of the Central Library, Grand Central Market, Orpheum 
Theater, Bradbury Building, Griffith Observatory, Bullock's Wilshire, all Art 
Deco apartment houses, the Hollywood sign, Hollywood Bowl, Goodyear Blimp, 
Abbott Kinney's Venice arcade and palm trees, I have settled permanently on one 
icon as the closest thing possible to a portmanteau L.A. trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Watts Towers, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Rodia's masterpiece does everything the "Steel Cloud" was supposed to do 
and more. It embodies L.A.'s populist genius, its rich racial stew and 
spontaneous inventiveness. No official body commissioned Rodia. He worked out 
of love. The best symbols of L.A. aren't planned. They just happen. Look at 
Melrose Avenue. Look at all the great graffiti art around town that drives 
people crazy because it's in the wrong places. If the "Steel Cloud" backers 
wanted to do something with the leftover money, they could do worse than 
commissioning murals on every bare wall downtown. Rodia would have liked that. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah. Observe the booster wringing his well-manicured palms and worrying that 
nobody much sees the Watts Towers because they are not in a nice part of town. 
That's the beauty of L.A. symbols, they don't actually have to be there. 
Rodia's towers are masterpieces in part because they are forever falling apart, 
reminding us of human vulnerability. If the city fathers aren't trying to pull 
them down, they are trying to save them from collapse and, in fact, they were 
further weakened by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cars, drive-in eateries, the Brown Derby and much else have vanished from 
here only to be made immortal in vivid memory which, in the absence of the real 
thing, comes to include delicious nostalgia and the stinging reminder that the 
Queen of the Angels has her ruthless side. She is as easily gentle as summer 
skies, as naturally rapacious as a kitten. "The Steel Cloud" lives. A skywriter 
should periodically letter it over the site. That way it will probably last 
longer than the freeway.

COMMENTARY; WHO WILL HOST THE OSCARS? IT'S NOT CRYSTAL CLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, when Billy Crystal's hosting of the Academy Awards was 
threatened by a lingering flu virus, the show's producer Gilbert Cates made an 
11th-hour call to Tom Hanks, asking the actor and sometime comedian if he would 
take over if Crystal couldn't make it to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 I was following Cates around that year, doing a story on the behind-the-scenes 
production of the show, and remember how anxious Cates was over Crystal's 
condition. It was Friday, three days before the show, and the host still hadn't 
been able to drag himself to rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanks didn't hesitate to say yes, even though he might not know until show day 
whether he was going in or not, and as Cates laid the phone back in its cradle, 
he let out a huge sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody could save the show, it would be Tom," he said. "He'd be a 
brilliant host." 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal made the date, of course, and gave what many critics thought was his 
best Oscar performance. It was the year that weird Jack Palance did all those 
one-armed push-ups and Crystal milked an evening's worth of gags out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Crystal has decided not to return for a fifth year, citing a bad case 
of host-itis (he's also emceed three Grammys and six Comic Relief events), 
Cates should think about redialing Hanks' number and offering him the job, with 
two months' notice. The producer's instincts were right about Hanks as host: He 
has charm, dignity, wit, intelligence and, it's worth mentioning, he's a movie 
star! 
</P>
<P>
 You would rather have Howard Stern? 
</P>
<P>
 Cates and other Oscar officials are being mum about a replacement for Crystal 
for the March 21 ceremony, though industry insiders know they have been looking 
for him or her for more than a month. Bette Midler, Steve Martin, Whoopi 
Goldberg and host emeritus Johnny Carson have all reportedly been offered the 
'94 gig and turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Williams would make a great host. He's an actor, he's funny and everyone 
loves him. But academy sources think he's a bit too wild for 3 1/2 hours of 
live television. Hey, the Academy Awards shows we remember best and fondest are 
those that almost got away, and attempts to reign it in and make network 
executives feel more comfortable have nearly ruined it for everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanks, apparently, has not been approached because he is almost certain to be 
a nominee for best actor for his role as a lawyer devastated by AIDS in 
"Philadelphia." There is the feeling among some academy people that it would be 
inappropriate to have a nominee doing double duty. They should be reminded that 
their own presenters are often nominees, and that other awards shows have 
survived the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Hanks' association with "Philadelphia" would make his presence as 
host fortuitous. In recent years, Oscar presenters have been able to don a pink 
ribbon on their way to the stage, in a Technicolor but silent call for more 
AIDS research. Whether Hanks were to win or not, whether he were to even 
mention the disease, he would be making a stronger statement to the audience 
than a dozen bows. 
</P>
<P>
 If not Hanks, who? Because Johnny Carson had such a successful run as Oscar 
host, people are inevitably throwing out the names of TV talk-show hosts Jay 
Leno, David Letterman and Arsenio Hall. Weirdly, Chevy Chase, the 1987 Oscar 
emcee, seems to have disqualified himself by losing his night job as a TV 
talk-show host. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences ought to remind itself 
occasionally that though the Oscars show is a television event, the subject is 
movies. The host doesn't have to be a professional wisecracker. Lionel 
Barrymore did it one year, so send Jack Nicholson up there. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie business is in even worse shape than we thought if, for its most 
important and public moment, it can't find a genial host among its own members.

DID CULTURES CLASH OVER 'SCHINDLER'S'?; MOVIES: SOME SAY OAKLAND HIGH SCHOOLERS 
EVICTED FROM THEATER FOR LAUGHING WERE IGNORANT OF HOLOCAUST, OTHERS SAY KIDS 
ARE TOO USED TO VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When a group of Oakland high school students went on a Martin Luther King Jr. 
holiday field trip to see Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List," their teachers 
hoped they'd learn about hatred and compassion. Instead, the 69 students were 
evicted from the theater because some of them laughed and talked while 
Holocaust horrors were on screen.  
</P>
<P>
 The incident has set off heated debates across the Bay Area -- from classrooms 
to radio talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Although perspectives of what happened in the theater last Monday differ 
wildly, most agree that these teen-agers know too little about the Holocaust 
and too much about violence. Some members of the matinee audience were so 
offended by the jeering during scenes showing Nazi atrocities, they demanded 
refunds. Although theater staff say they repeatedly asked the students to be 
quiet, the interruptions continued. The final straw, some say, was when about 
20 students laughed at a scene where a Nazi guard shoots a Jewish woman in the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 30 outraged patrons stormed into the lobby, complaining about the 
derisive laughter and offensive comments during the atrocities -- when Jews 
were murdered on screen," said Allen Michaan, owner of Oakland's Grand Lake 
Theater. "I've never seen such furious, hurt customers. Some were Holocaust 
survivors and one woman was sobbing." 
</P>
<P>
 Michaan ordered the movie stopped and asked all Castlemont High School 
students to leave. As they filed out, many of the 450 patrons applauded. School 
officials say few students understood why they were evicted. 
</P>
<P>
 One patron called the students "rowdy and offensive, loud troublemakers" who 
"were talking over the movie and laughing at the sight of Jews being 
assassinated on screen. What a strange way to celebrate Martin Luther King Day, 
by insulting the memory of Holocaust victims." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Was it callous insensitivity or ignorance about the Holocaust and a clash of 
cultures? Dean of Students Tanya Dennis, one of four chaperons on the ill-fated 
field trip, agrees that her students were unprepared for the movie, but 
maintains they were "evicted unfairly, with no warning." She said: "A few 
students giggled and talked only because they were affected by the Nazi killing 
or thought that a woman was contorting in death in a way that looked strange to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis believes friction began before the movie started. "Some elderly white 
people were wondering what black kids were doing at the movie. Our kids have 
seen more violence and suffered more oppression than these people." 
</P>
<P>
 Michaan takes issue with Dennis: "It's disgusting that some people are 
cloaking this incident in a mantle of racism. . . . Few people saw the students 
because they entered the theater only minutes before the film started."  
</P>
<P>
 Another chaperon, math teacher Aaron Grumet, who lost relatives in the 
Holocaust, said: "Most of my students have seen people shot, so they laughed 
when the shooting didn't look realistic. They're not Afro-American kids 
laughing at Jewish horror, they're the inner-city, hip-hop generation, 
desensitized to violence because they see it everyday." Grumet said while he 
doesn't blame the patrons "for being so upset, these kids are 14 to 16 and 
unfortunately know almost nothing about the Holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
 Shalon Paige, 14, explained, "When the Jewish girl got shot in the head, she 
moved weird so some kids laughed. They didn't have to kick nobody out. Maybe 
they're so upset at us, prejudiced because they're white." Many students say 
they went on the field trip only because it included ice skating afterward, and 
some sneaked into adjoining theaters to see "Pelican Brief" and "Grumpy Old 
Men." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Paige: "They didn't want to see a three-hour movie in black-and-white. We 
don't know about that war. It was long ago and far away and about people we 
never met." 
</P>
<P>
 Paige's sentiments are indicative of a widespread nationwide problem. One of 
her classmates thinks the Holocaust was the bomb dropped on Japan during World 
War II; another believes Hitler is still alive. Many, like Paige, have never 
met a Jew. "We don't know about those concentration camps, but I do hear a lot 
of Jew jokes," Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Roper poll of Americans last year found more than 50% of high school 
students didn't know what the word Holocaust means and 22% said it seemed 
"possible" that "the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Levy, spokesman for the "Schindler's List" producing company Amblin 
Entertainment, said: "This is not a movie people can just walk into. People, 
especially high school kids, need some background, so that's why we sent 
'Schindler's List' study guides to over 30,000 high schools. Obviously, these 
students never got them." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg, via Levy, said: "If the only thing that comes out of 'Schindler's 
List' is that there are more Holocaust study courses in high schools across the 
country, we will have accomplished a great deal."

POP BEAT: WHIGGED OUT; GROUP'S 'GENTLEMEN' DELVES INTO DARK PSYCHE OF '90S MALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Afghan Whigs' album "Gentlemen" wasn't a commercial smash, and it didn't 
show up on a lot of year-end Top 10 lists, but it just might be the overlooked 
masterpiece of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cincinnati group's first major-label release, which came out last fall, is 
a grueling immersion in the latest methods of warfare in the battle of the 
sexes -- a dark, dramatic wallow in lust, shame, guilt, despair, deceit and 
obsession that's framed in dense, uplifting rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Its key lyrical images and melodic motifs recur in shifting forms, generating 
a unified feel that reflects its musical inspiration, Van Morrison's landmark 
1968 album "Astral Weeks." The immediate trigger for the story itself was 
Francis Coppola's 1982 romantic fantasy "One From the Heart" -- no surprise, 
since Whigs' leader Greg Dulli was a teen filmmaker before he took up music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really, really identified with the Frederic Forrest character in 'One From 
the Heart,' and that was sort of the beginning of the thematic process," Dulli 
says. "He was just a real kind of heel, but you could tell he didn't want to be 
one, that he wasn't really one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people get kinda disappointed when I say the album isn't all 
autobiographical, and I'm like, God, that's kind of mean, to think something 
like that. Why would you want poor little me to go through all that? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like anything else. You use some license. It's observation. Maybe it 
started out with something autobiographical, and then you want to blow it up 
into something bigger. Once I got onto the theme with the songs, I pressed on 
to see how much further I could go into the dark psyche of the '90s male." 
</P>
<P>
 Dulli, 28, grew up in Hamilton, an industrial town north of Cincinnati, and 
turned to music when he moved to Los Angeles in 1984 after dropping out of film 
school at the University of Cincinnati. He worked at Tower Records on Sunset 
Boulevard and started seeing rock shows around town. L.A.'s Dream Syndicate is 
the band that inspired him to become a musician. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Ohio, he teamed with guitarist Rick McCollum, bassist John Curley and 
drummer Steven Earle to form the Whigs. They released an album on their own, 
then made three records for the influential independent Sub Pop label -- 
concluding with "Uptown Avondale," a collection of five Motown songs that got 
the special Whigs treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was actually the beginning of the new album in a way," Dulli says of the 
collection. "We started playing with atmosphere. . . . The songs that I picked 
were like, 'Come See About Me,' 'Band of Gold' -- happy songs where the words 
were really, really sad. And I wanted to make the music more sympathetic with 
the lyrics, so we made the music more minor key, slowed them down, and that's 
what I wanted to go into on 'Gentlemen.' How far can I go into it? How dark is 
dark?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Whigs built a following on the alternative-rock scene, leading to their 
signing by Elektra. "Gentlemen," released last fall, hasn't put the Whigs in 
the '93 breakthrough class with Smashing Pumpkins and the Breeders -- two other 
bands from the geographical heartland and the psychological frontier -- but 
it's early, and Dulli is content to wait it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not impatient at all. We've always been a gradual band. . . . And you 
know what? If that never came, I can really honestly say that the day we 
finished that record and I put the final touches on the last mix, the pride and 
satisfaction that I felt were enough for me. Deep in my heart I know that we 
made a special record."

QUAKE HITS TV IN THE WALLET; LOCAL STATIONS: AD-FREE NEWS REPORTING IS 
EXPENSIVE, BUT THE COVERAGE IS EXPECTED TO BE LESS COSTLY THAN FOR THE FIRES 
AND RIOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Los Angeles television stations are still tabulating the financial impact of 
their mostly advertising-free extended coverage of Monday's earthquake, but one 
general manager believes the costs will be lower than for last fall's wildfires 
or the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all adds up quicker than I can count," KTLA-TV Channel 5 General Manager 
Greg Nathanson said. "But no matter what any station says they lost, they can 
make a lot of the money up." 
</P>
<P>
 Nathanson said the reasons for the difference from the previous incidents is 
that the quake coverage is shorter, involves fewer elements and comes during a 
month when less advertising is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 KCBS-TV Channel 2 General Manager Bill Applegate agreed, saying that unless 
the major aftershocks continue for several more days, the earthquake will have 
less of an impact on advertising revenues than the fires because the fires were 
spread over a longer period. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs come from two factors -- overtime paid to employees and lost 
revenues from advertisements that didn't air. At most stations, the overtime 
sums won't be calculated until next week and final figures on the advertising 
losses won't come until mid-February. At KCBS, the advertising loss is, "about 
at $500,000," Applegate said.  
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, an L.A. network affiliate estimated that the wildfires cost 
each channel $400,000-$500,000 for every day of lost advertising and 
$50,000-$100,000 a day for the additional news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because most advertisers do not buy time on a specific show, stations 
reschedule missed commercials by moving them into unsold slots. Because of the 
recession-weakened ad market, stations do have openings for many of the 
preempted advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are plenty of exceptions. KTLA found itself stung when it had to 
preempt Monday's heavily promoted premiere of the made-for-television biography 
of civil rights pioneer Vernon Johns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sold a lot of advertising for that," Nathanson said. "A lot of advertisers 
had bought just that show. We lost all that money until we run it." 
</P>
<P>
 KTLA has tentatively rescheduled the movie for Feb. 7, but Nathanson said 
certain advertisers, such as film studios with movies premiering later this 
week, may not be interested in buying time then. 
</P>
<P>
 One compensating factor Nathanson pointed out is that "The Vernon Johns Story" 
received a 14 rating and won its time period when it was carried by fellow 
Tribune Broadcasting-owned station WGN in Chicago, with those high ratings 
possibly prompting other advertisers to step in. 
</P>
<P>
 Another hard-to-determine cost is how the earthquake will impact on the future 
advertising market. KTTV-TV General Manager Tom Capra said some retailers have 
called his station asking that it not run their commercials because their 
outlets have been closed because of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But Capra said the estimated $15 billion to $30 billion in repairs and 
reconstruction needed because of the earthquake could mean that firms will seek 
out new advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to hazard a guess, the net effect would probably be a wash, but it 
might even be a plus," Capra said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the executives interviewed for this story had one common comment -- the 
coverage expenses are not a concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "In these kinds of situations, you don't (ask) how much are we spending," said 
KCBS' Applegate, whose station ran 40 consecutive hours of commercial-free 
coverage. "This is what we're here to do. It's a gigantic news story. We're a 
CBS station committed to news and information and you do what the story 
requires."

LANNAN BOARD VOTES TO FORGO ART COLLECTING; FINANCES: FOUNDATION EARMARKS THOSE 
FUNDS FOR A CHARITABLE PROGRAM TO BENEFIT 'AMERICA'S POOREST PEOPLE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Lannan Foundation -- a $150-million nonprofit organization that supports 
visual art, literature and charitable causes -- has terminated its art 
collecting program. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise decision made official earlier this week, the foundation's board 
of directors voted to shift the $2 million to $3 million that had been 
allocated annually for purchasing art to a charitable program for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't have a big impact on the art market," foundation president J. 
Patrick Lannan Jr. said of the board's action. "In the great scheme of things, 
it's a minuscule amount of money. But if we use our resources carefully we can 
make a difference to a few people, so we are going to try to do that." The 
funds will go to a grant-making program to benefit "America's poorest people," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The news is a blow to Los Angeles' art community, which has taken pride in the 
foundation's growing collection. "You can't argue with charitable money that 
goes for good purposes, whatever those purposes may be," said Henry T. Hopkins, 
head of UCLA's art department and galleries. "But this is an unfortunate loss 
at this time, when the art world is so fragile and collecting has diminished. 
The Lannan Foundation seemed to be one of the few constant elements." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation was formed in 1960 by Lannan's father, J. Patrick Lannan, a 
longtime director of International Telephone and Telegraph and an exuberant 
collector of contemporary art. After his death in 1983, his son took charge of 
the foundation and in 1986 moved its headquarters from Lake Worth, Fla., to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, the foundation opened a 4,500-square-foot exhibition space 
and a 3,000-square-foot sculpture garden in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation will maintain its existing 1,750-piece collection of 
contemporary art, as well as its exhibition program and grants to other art 
institutions for exhibitions, installations and performances, Lannan said. But 
plans to expand the exhibition space have been dropped and the foundation has 
made its final purchases of contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to put more money into charity was the result of ongoing board 
discussions about the foundation's priorities, Lannan said. "We were looking 
for a site to build and expand the foundation, but we also have been 
considering other areas where we could do and should do more. Rather than go 
ahead with plans for expansion and continue collecting, we decided to increase 
our funding to charity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lannan said the shift in allocations is not the first step in phasing out the 
entire visual art program. Neither does the move indicate a change of 
direction, he said. "Although they are not as well-known as the visual art 
program, we have always had literary and charitable programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Professing a firm commitment to the art program, Lannan said it will continue 
to be the foundation's largest concern, even without collecting. He declined to 
outline the budget, but said the foundation spends 6.5% of the total value of 
its assets, or about $9.75 million, each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lannan's father began collecting in the 1950s and developed a passion for the 
art of his time, particularly abstract painting. He sought out and often bought 
the works of emerging artists who would become major figures. Since his death, 
the foundation has followed his pattern of collecting while adding new artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection includes large bodies of work by Morris Louis, Robert Irwin, 
Wallace Berman, Gerhard Richter and Mike Kelley, along with such unique 
treasures as Edward Kienholz's assemblage portrait of curator Walter Hopps, 
"Walter Hopps Hopps Hopps," and sculptor Tom Otterness' masterpiece, "The 
Tables," which portrays an apocalyptic fantasy on three steel picnic tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these purchases have been made at the behest of Lisa Lyons, an 
internationally known curator and author who has directed the foundation's art 
programs since 1989. "The termination of the Lannan Foundation's collecting 
program represents a tremendous loss to the art world," she said. As to whether 
she plans to retain her post or resign, Lyons said: "I'm considering my 
options." 
</P>
<P>
 Voicing support for Lyons, Lannan said, "None of this has anything to do with 
Lisa. We have the highest regard for her. I understand her frustration because 
curators are trained to build collections, but we are doing everything we can 
to encourage her to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its exhibitions and grant-making programs, the foundation's 
future visual art activities are likely to include publishing books of art 
criticism and making a greater effort to place works from the collection on 
long-term loan at other institutions so that they can gain a wider audience, 
Lannan said.

FAST FORWARD; THE SOUND OF BELA FLECK'S NEWLY RECHARGED FLECKTONES KEEPS 
PROGRESSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a nice symmetry in banjo player Bela Fleck's having been asked to 
record the theme for the "Beverly Hillbillies" movie last year. It was Lester 
Flatt and Earl Scrugg's familiar ditty from the original television series 
("Let me tell you the story of a man named Jed . . . ") that caught a young 
Fleck's ear and turned him toward the banjo in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 But this look back is atypical of the forward-thinking Fleck. 
</P>
<P>
 His band, the Flecktones, is arguably the most progressive banjo-centered 
ensemble on the planet: Fleck's acoustic picking is heard against hard, 
electric bass backing and synthesized drums sounds pulled from a guitar-like 
device called a Synth-Axe Drumitar. And after three years of this jazz, funk 
and bluegrass hybrid, the Flecktones' sound continues to evolve. 
</P>
<P>
 A quartet when they formed in 1990, the Flecktones lost one of their principal 
members last year when, after three recordings with the group, 
keyboardist/harmonica player/multi-instrumentalist Howard Levy left to pursue 
his own work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are band people," Fleck, 35, explained on the phone from his home 
in Nashville this week, "and some people are solo people. People who know 
Howard say they're not surprised that he left but that he was in the band for 
three years."  
</P>
<P>
 The loss of someone whose versatility added so much to the Flecktones' sound 
might seem a crippling blow. But Fleck kept the core of his group together -- 
bassist Victor Lemonte Wooten and his brother, percussionist Future Man (Roy 
Wooten) -- and the Flecktones now operate as a trio. They play Sunday night at 
the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 The shrinkage in manpower has actually expanded the band's sound, Fleck said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're using more effects to make it work," he said. "I have a synthesizer 
hooked up to my banjo and can trigger percussion and vibes and other weird 
effects. Everybody in the band has new things to work with. Future Man has 
floor pedals that run a computer, and Victor has sounds he also can control 
from the floor. He also plays two basses at once, with one suspended on a 
stand. But the banjo is still central." 
</P>
<P>
 The result of all this powering-up is the band's latest release, "Three Flew 
Over the Cuckoo's Nest," an effort that finds the Flecktones joined on some 
numbers by Branford Marsalis and Bruce Hornsby. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleck says the same rules that applied to the band when it was a quartet apply 
now. "It's the same approach: We try to make music that's complete no matter 
how many people are playing. The trio works fine if you arrange for it. In 
fact, certain kinds of material work better with a trio." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleck, who was raised in New York City, picked up the banjo as a sophomore at 
the respected Manhattan School of Music and Art. "I was in the chorus there," 
he recalls, "and was exposed to stuff that most banjo players never were." 
</P>
<P>
 After moving through several bluegrass bands, Fleck joined the groundbreaking 
New Grass Revival in 1981. The group opened his ears to more contemporary 
applications of traditional instruments, and the idea for the Flecktones, he 
said, practically generated itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group just fell into place. I was in a band and had no intention of 
leaving. Then Victor (Wooten) called me out of the blue and played his bass 
over the phone to me and blew my mind. I wanted to play more jazz on the banjo 
but hadn't really had the opportunity and hadn't found the musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleck said the Wooten brothers definitely inspired the Flecktone direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are more than jazz musicians," Fleck said. "They're very flexible. 
With them, it doesn't just have to be jazz; they're willing to try anything as 
long as there's a good way to present it. And that's what attracted me to them, 
their open-minded attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
 Though funk may be the most apparent form in the Flecktones' mix, other styles 
contribute as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely influenced by Irish folk music and various types of other 
roots music: folk, blues, New Orleans and country," Fleck said. "And there's 
obviously a jazz attitude. But there's also a classical influence. My 
stepfather was a cello player and I grew up hearing string quartets. Though I'm 
no aficionado, it snuck into my head and influences my voicings." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fleck's next recording project will include the Flecktones but will be 
released under his own name. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a lot more acoustic and a lot less commercial -- a whole different 
emotional approach," he said. "There'll be a lot of guests. I want to explore, 
go into the studio and fool around with as many people as I want on any 
particular song." 
</P>
<P>
 The urge to explore his music more deeply has encouraged Fleck to cut back on 
a busy road schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying to make it saner, but we still go out on 120 dates or so 
each year, though that's half of what we did when we first started. But the 
gigs are better, so we don't have to beat ourselves up on the road so much now. 
We're getting to practice in a more relaxed fashion, with time to recharge. We 
didn't do that the first few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Living in Nashville, as he has for 14 years, also encourages exploration, he 
said. "It's a sane place to live. And there's an outlet to the rest of the 
music business from here, without being victimized by the New York or Los 
Angeles scene. There are wonderful musicians here, especially acoustic 
musicians. It's a little bit secluded -- there's not that much musical 
inspiration in a jazz sense -- but that's OK if you have plenty going on in 
your head. It's the perfect place for someone like me, coming out of the 
bluegrass arena and turning left."

NOT MUCH ROOM FOR CHANGE IN VIENNA CHOIR BOYS; MUSIC: GLOBE-TROTTING 
CHORISTERS, AGE 10 TO 14, KEEP A CENTURIES-OLD TRADITION GOING -- AT LEAST 
UNTIL THEIR VOICES CRACK. THEY'RE IN CERRITOS TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Six years after Columbus landed in America, some five centuries ago, by the 
Emperor's decree, the choristers of the Imperial Chapel in Vienna began 
singing. One of the group's more recent members, having served a five-year 
stint in the early 19th Century, was Franz Schubert. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this century, the collapse of the Hapsburg dynasty resulted in a brief 
hiatus for the choristers. Resurrected and re-christened the Vienna Choir Boys, 
the group donned sailor suits and -- unlike Columbus, who figured two trips 
were enough -- embarked on an endless world tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the boys dock at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are actually four (touring) choirs, 24 boys each, and each with its own 
choirmaster, nurse and prefect," said Kurt Manninger, one of the prefects, 
reached by cellular phone with a busload of boys en route to Lancaster, where 
they performed earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to hold them together," Manninger said, "see that nothing happens, help 
them with little problems. They lose something, there's something to fix, I put 
on a Band-Aid." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to tours of Asia, Australia, South America and South Africa, the 
Vienna Choir Boys (a.k.a. die Wiener Sangerknaben) have visited the United 
States more than 50 times since 1932. At least one choir remains in Vienna for 
Sunday Hofkapelle services with the Vienna Philharmonic, a major tourist 
attraction, while the others tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The program for Cerritos is divided into three parts: sacred music including 
"Veni, Sancte Spiritus" by Mozart and "Laudi alla Vergine Maria" by Verdi; a 
one-act opera, compiled especially for the boys, called "Tales From the Vienna 
Woods," based on music by Johann Strauss, and secular selections including 
"Zigeunerleben" by Schumann.  
</P>
<P>
 The program when the boys are not performing is also full. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to the San Diego Zoo; we went to Mexico for a look, the Grand Canyon, 
bowling, and when we're in Los Angeles we're going to Disneyland," Manninger 
recounted. "This is all good for the concentration when they perform." 
</P>
<P>
 Between the two world wars, the choir counted among its conductors the great 
Bruno Walter. Its latest conductor, and also its accompanist, is Vincent 
Borrits of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 The Augarten Palace in Vienna serves as the boys' permanent home. Classrooms 
occupy the lower floors; dormitories overlook the gardens. Two women keep the 
boys in their customary sailor suits: "This outfit was the norm for the 
children not of the crown, but of the well-off, 100, 150 years ago," Menninger 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When voices inevitably break with the onset of adolescence, the "older" boys 
retire to studio apartments on the palace grounds, where they live rent-free 
while finishing their educations. For every six voices, on average, that break 
each year, 30 youngsters are waiting in the wings to audition. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys in Manninger's group range in age from 10 to 14. Can they possibly be 
the angels they seem in countless films, recordings and television appearances? 
</P>
<P>
 "They're normal boys. The only thing is that they can sing very well and 
behave on the stage and in public," Manninger said. "They listen to Guns N' 
Roses." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Vienna Choir Boys sing tonight at 8 at the Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts, 12700 Center Court Drive, Cerritos. The program includes 
"Tales From the Vienna Woods," a one-act opera based on music by Johann 
Strauss, and other works, sacred and secular. $20-$30. (800) 300-4345 or (310) 
916-8500.

PARAGUAYAN HARP AND SOLE; WORLD MUSIC: ALFREDO ROLANDO ORTIZ BREAKS STEREOTYPES 
WITH TRADITIONAL SOUTH AMERICAN DANCE COMPOSITIONS AND ORIGINAL WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Forget angels, forget the Marx Brothers. And if you think a concert of music 
for Paraguayan harp sounds the least bit esoteric, forget that too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played a recital recently, and I opened with a joropo, a very lively 
Venezuelan style (of music)," recalled Alfredo Rolando Ortiz, who performs 
tonight at the San Juan Capistrano Regional Library. "Nobody thought they were 
listening to somebody with wings hanging from a Christmas tree! 
</P>
<P>
 "Ethereal, relaxing, meditative -- I've played all the kinds of music people 
expect from the harp. But what the harp is in our countries is music for 
dancing." Ortiz said that the Mexican tune "La Bamba" was originally written 
for the harp, specifically the arpa veracruzana.  
</P>
<P>
 The program, with seatings at 7 and 9 p.m., will feature traditional South 
American melodies as well as premieres of several works by Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Cuba, a citizen of Venezuela, a medical school graduate in Colombia 
and a resident of the United States for almost 20 years, Ortiz regularly 
appears in concert and teaches master classes around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently performed and taught classes at the Australian Harp Festival and 
has been invited back to the Mozart Festival in San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz, who has recorded more than 30 albums on the arpa paraguaya , said that 
interest in Latin American harps in general is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It varies from area to area," Ortiz said in a recent phone interview from his 
home in Corona. "At the Mozart Festival last summer, the concert not only sold 
out, but groupies followed us from event to event! I did not, as a matter of 
fact, play a single piece by Mozart. Mozart composed for harp, but not my kind 
of harp.  
</P>
<P>
 "People ask me (whether I) play classical music -- after I've just played 
classical music, my kind of classical music. Everything classical is not 
written by a known composer, or a European composer." 
</P>
<P>
 All Latin American harps have their roots in Spanish harps as far back as the 
16th Century. Early this century, changes in construction of the Paraguayan 
harp resulted in a perfectly symmetrical, lightweight, very stable instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz says he may be the first person to write down music for Paraguayan harp, 
which he did for a self-published book called "Latin American Harps: History, 
Music and Technique." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's not worried that he may be straitjacketing an evolving performing style 
by putting the music to paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "This book was never intended for (traditional) players, since we still all 
play by ear," Ortiz said. "This is to make our music available to the classical 
harp world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The classical harp world is based only on (written) music. . . . If it is not 
written, it does not exist. (Before this book,) our music was only mentioned in 
an anecdotal way. Nobody played it outside of folk players in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to share our music with the rest of the harp world. Now this music 
has been recorded by people playing classical pedal harp." 
</P>
<P>
 Should Paraguayan harp music be played on classical pedal harp? 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that you can only play this kind of music on this kind of harp, this 
idea of 'authentic performance practice,' that has never been the case in 
music; it's as silly as it sounds," Ortiz said. "People all through the ages 
have played the music they wanted to play on the instruments that were 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always some narrow-minded attitude, but to me an instrument is 
(just) that, an instrument -- to be enjoyed. I don't teach Paraguayan harp, I 
use Paraguayan harps, and, using them, I want people to be able to enjoy the 
music they like, from rock to rap to classics." 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz has an album due in February including his "Suite for a Birth," inspired 
by the birth of his second daughter, now 13, and improvised and taped in the 
delivery room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to help my wife relax," he recalled. "I was playing on and off, 
because I was also coaching her. The doctor's wife, who had been a harp student 
. . . walked in with mask and everything and said, 'You keep playing; I'll 
coach Luz Marina.' 
</P>
<P>
 "When it came to the actual birth moment, I couldn't come up with anything 
better, so the suite ends with the tape from that moment. You can hear the baby 
cry, and you can hear my wife answer, 'My baby, my baby.' " 
</P>
<P>

harp tonight at the San Juan Capistrano Regional Library, 31495 El Camino Real,

TONED-DOWN 'TALES FROM CRYPT' STARTS ON FOX TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A toned-down version of "Tales From the Crypt," a made-for-HBO anthology 
series awash in blood and body parts, will find a new audience tonight on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 The network bought 65 episodes of the campy half-hour series, hosted by a 
rotting animatronic corpse, and will replay them in an hour block on Saturdays 
at 11 p.m., replacing "Comic Strip Live." 
</P>
<P>
 Next Friday night, "Tales" will even receive a promotional pump in prime time, 
preempting "The X-Files." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who worry the terrifying "Tales" may be too frightful, violent or 
profane for broadcast audiences, consider that the series has already been 
adapted into "Tales From the Cryptkeeper," an ABC Saturday-morning cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tales From the Crypt" and "Vault of Horrors" were published by William Gaines 
in the 1940s and 1950s as ghoulish comic books, and four decades later they are 
still making their way along the entertainment food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 After filmmakers Joel Silver, Richard Donner, Walter Hill, Robert Zemeckis and 
David Giler purchased the rights to Gaines' E.C. Comics in the 1980s, they 
developed the "Tales" series for HBO in 1989. It was HBO's first real dramatic 
series and helped establish the premium cable service with original programming 
that routinely got higher ratings than network shows in HBO households. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Tales" were produced on extravagant budgets, frequently pushing $1 
million for an episode, and became a forum for such first-time directors as 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael J. Fox and Tom Hanks, who directed tonight's 
premiere episode on Fox. Top-flight stars such as Demi Moore, Joe Pesci and 
Whoopi Goldberg also took part before the camera, working for scale wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign and videotape repackaging followed, and three feature films are in the 
works for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources suggest that all this activity is necessary to make "Tales" pay off 
for its five executive producers. Episodes will continue running on HBO in 
their uncut form, but no more originals are being made. 
</P>
<P>
 HBO's license fee did not cover the full cost of production, so HBO loaned the 
producers money to cover the $100,000 or more deficit per episode. The eventual 
gold mine the producers were digging for was syndication, much like the success 
of "The Twilight Zone." 
</P>
<P>
 But the syndication market is slow, with Warner Bros. and Paramount trying to 
launch new TV networks. Until the dust settles, many stations are holding off 
on buying new programming. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox deal is seen as a way for the producers to get at least some money 
back right now. Fox is reportedly paying no more for episodes of "Tales" than 
it was for "Comic Strip Live" -- about $60,000 per episode, according to 
sources.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are two schools of thought on this," noted one TV executive who asked 
not to be identified. "On one side, it's a smart move for 'Tales From the 
Crypt' because they're getting real exposure, and moving it from HBO to a 
broadcast network will increase its syndication value." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, 17.4 million homes carry HBO, while Fox can be seen in roughly 90 
million U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other side, you could argue that they are sort of trashing the 
syndication value -- in effect, syndicating the show to Fox," the executive 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 For HBO, the Fox deal is sweet, not scary, said Bridget Potter, senior vice 
president of original programming for HBO. "First, we will get some of our 
deficit back off this deal. Second, the Fox shows are edited for broadcast 
television. So HBO is still the only place you can see the authentic 'Tales 
From the Crypt' episodes. Third, the Fox show is called ' HBO's Tales From the 
Crypt.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So, what about all that gore and mayhem? Two versions were shot of many 
"Tales" scenes involving nudity, and when the actors originally filmed they 
looped over much of the profanity in a recording studio. Anything else will be 
cut.

KTLA CHANNEL 5 GIVES AN ASSIST TO NETWORKS' QUAKE COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest of a long line of examples of KTLA-TV Channel 5 assisting the 
major networks, portions of the independent station's coverage of Monday's 
earthquake were used by ABC and CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 When technical problems kept KABC-TV Channel 7 and KCBS-TV Channel 2 from 
providing their networks with pictures, the networks contacted KTLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Because News Director Warren Cereghino was not available, an editor on the 
assignment desk gave his approval to the ABC and CBS officials, both with whom 
he had working relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane Venardos, CBS News vice president for hard news and special events, said 
his network used about 45 minutes of KTLA's coverage, mainly shots from its 
helicopter before switching to KCBS' work. 
</P>
<P>
 But ABC made far more extensive use of KTLA's coverage, interspersing it with 
KABC's and its own throughout its seven hours of continuous live reports. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC asked to use KTLA's coverage because its Los Angeles bureau chief, Kathy 
O'Hern, had been watching the station and was impressed by its work, an ABC 
News spokesman said. ABC anchorman Ted Koppel praised KTLA's efforts on the 
air, and ABC sent flowers and champagne to the station, Cereghino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cereghino said the decision to allow the networks to use KTLA's coverage 
initially concerned him because it meant that fellow Tribune Broadcasting-owned 
stations in New York City, Chicago, Atlanta and Denver, which were carrying 
KTLA's signal, would find themselves competing against those very same 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 But those fears proved to be unfounded, as none of those station's news 
directors or general managers have contacted Cereghino or KTLA General Manager 
Greg Nathanson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of CNN's coverage were also provided by KTLA. The station is a CNN 
affiliate, meaning it is allowed to use CNN's coverage in exchange for CNN's 
use of its work. CNN has similar arrangements with six other area TV 
broadcasters. CNN also used some of KCAL-TV Channel 9's and KTTV-TV Channel 
11's earthquake coverage, a CNN spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to share coverage is made on a case-by-case basis, Cereghino 
said. Previous events that KTLA has assisted the major networks include the 
1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, the 1965 Watts riots, the 1992 riots 
and many of the region's fires.  
</P>
<P>
 KTLA also has a similar policy with Los Angeles' foreign-language stations, 
who do not have the resources of the English-language counterparts, so they can 
better serve their viewers and stop the spread of unfounded and potentially 
dangerous rumors. STEVEN HERBERT

GARDENING; PATIENT GROWERS SPEAR GREAT CROPS OF ASPARAGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask people who have grown asparagus in their gardens, and they'll assure you 
that nothing compares with the flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so tender and sweet that they can be eaten raw in salads," said 
Virginia Stowers, who has been tending an asparagus bed at her Anaheim home for 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Asparagus is a perennial vegetable that can produce bountiful crops for 15 to 
20 years. It takes several years to become established, however, and that's one 
reason people have been reluctant to include it in their gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 When homeowners swapped houses every three or four years, they weren't around 
long enough to reap the harvests, for it takes at least three years for 
asparagus beds to grow vigorously enough for harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the slowdown in moves, more people are seeking permanent plantings. 
Thompson & Morgan, a respected seed company in England and Connecticut, sees 
this trend continuing and is expanding its 1995 catalogue description of 
asparagus from 10 lines to one full page. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an overlooked vegetable that belongs in more gardens," said Paul 
Henslid, commercial director for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Native to Europe, asparagus was cultivated in ancient Rome and Greece. 
Introduced to America by French settlers in the 17th Century, it became a 
successful commercial crop. California is one of the nation's leading asparagus 
producers, and Orange County is a popular growing site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember buying asparagus spears from local stands when they were grown on 
the Irvine Ranch," said John Donan of Cowan Heights. A past president of the 
Orange County Organic Gardening Club, Donan now grows his own. 
</P>
<P>
 So does Stan Tinkle of Anaheim, president of the California Organic Gardening 
Club. But he admits to a love-hate relationship with the perennial vegetable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have clay soil, and asparagus really do better in sandy loam, so for a 
while it was a struggle to get a really good crop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, many gardeners prefer to grow them in raised beds, filled 
with rich, porous loam and amended with compost or well-rotted manure. It's an 
easy way to control water and fertilizer, as well as growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over time, asparagus can really spread, even into areas you don't want, so 
putting them in containers or raised beds keeps that from happening," said Phil 
Miller of Roger's Gardens in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't want to build a raised bed, you can plant the crowns in a large 
plastic container with the bottom removed, Miller suggested. Sink the 
containers in the ground and leave the rim just above soil surface. The roots 
can penetrate the soil without spreading beyond their boundary, and the plants 
will flourish where you want them. 
</P>
<P>
 Now is the time to plant asparagus, and many local nurseries offer crowns of 
year-old plants. Although Mary Washington is the best known variety, newer 
hybrids have been developed recently that produce better yields. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed for commercial growers and only available in the last few years, UC 
157 is reported to be the best variety for warm climates like Orange County's. 
It has excellent yields and outstanding flavor. If you have difficulty finding 
this variety in local nurseries, you can order it from Shepherd's Garden Seeds 
or Burpee Company. 
</P>
<P>
 Another popular variety is Jersey Giant. Like UC 157, it produces more male 
than female plants, which means more spears than seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Asparagus is ornamental. The spears are actually shoots that produce fern-like 
leaves during the summer. The plants grow up to three feet tall and look 
graceful, so they can be used to line fences or along south-facing walls as the 
back border of perennial flower beds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These plants will produce for almost two decades, so proper planting and care 
now ensures plentiful harvests in years to come. The planting method is the 
same for all varieties. Select an area that gets full sun. Asparagus roots 
spread widely, so they need wide trenches -- at least a foot wide and eight 
inches deep. Most of Orange County has clay soil, so be sure to amend 
liberally.  
</P>
<P>
 After amending, add general purpose vegetable fertilizer according to package 
directions, cover with several inches of soil, and then place the crowns at the 
bottom of the trench a foot apart. Add amended soil just to cover the crowns. 
Gradually fill the trenches as the spears emerge, in about three to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow the same method if you grow them in a raised bed. You'll notice that 
after six months or a year, the soil level in the bed has dropped, so replenish 
as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Asparagus needs watering weekly, but doesn't like soggy conditions. That's why 
it's important that the soil drain well to prevent rotting of the roots. The 
plants also need fertilizing monthly during late winter and early spring as the 
spears emerge and the ferns grow. Continue feeding during the growing period. 
If you prefer the organic method, you can use fish emulsion and/or liquid 
seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Shepherd, owner of Shepherd's Garden Seeds, is an avid fan of asparagus 
and reports very good results with monthly feedings of fish and seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the plants follow their natural cycle. The ferns will yellow in winter, 
which means their nutrients have been transferred to the roots for the 
following spring's growth. Cut the plants to ground level. 
</P>
<P>
 Although you'll be eager to taste the rewards of your labor, be patient the 
first spring and don't harvest. The plants need the spears and leaves for their 
development. By the second year, you can cut several spears from each plant. 
But your efforts will be rewarded the next year when you'll be able to cut 
sweet and tender stalks every day during the entire spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're incredible plants because those spears keep coming and coming and 
coming," Miller said. Sources

GET CRACKING; THOROUGH INSPECTION BEFORE A QUAKE STRIKES CAN HELP IN ASSESSING 
DAMAGE AFTERWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARESA ARCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Obvious signs of earthquake damage to your home -- broken glass, crumbling 
stucco, buckled driveways -- are easy to detect, but in many cases looking for 
less-apparent signs and adding them up will be what lets you know whether your 
home has suffered underlying structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's clear at the outset that your home has not ridden out the quake well, 
get in touch right away with a city or county building inspector. Their 
services are usually free, and they can tell you if you need a more detailed 
review by a commercial inspector or engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to detect if a structure has sustained earthquake damage is to 
have been familiar with any imperfections before the temblor. Routine 
inspections of property, documenting any existing cracks with a photograph or 
note, will help later evaluations of the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, even if you do not suspect that your home is damaged, it is 
important to inspect it now. Get to know your home so that you will have points 
of reference.  
</P>
<P>
 As you inspect for damage, try to differentiate structural from cosmetic 
changes. For example, says Eugene D. Prowizer of A Aa Building Inspector 
Services in Culver City, a broken sheet of drywall might be a cosmetic problem. 
It's what has happened to the framework behind the drywall that will indicate 
if there is structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 As you check a house for damage, experts suggest starting outside and working 
your way into the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some things to look for: Are Things Leaning? 
</P>
<P>
 Stand back from the house and look at it in relation to the ground, checking 
to see if it is leaning. "You'd be surprised at just how much the eye can 
detect," said Tom Carroll of AmeriSpec Home Inspection Service in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Walls, ceilings and floors in most houses are not perfectly square or plumb. 
But if after a quake there is a slant of more than a couple of inches in any 
structure, the house needs to be inspected by a professional. Also check to see 
if trees are out of kilter. Their roots may have shaken loose, and they may be 
ready to topple. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, place a ball in the middle of uncarpeted floors and see if it rolls to 
a corner. "If it starts rolling like heck, you know something's not quite 
right," said Jim Beyers of Golden State Inspection Services in Anaheim. Is 
Fireplace Intact? 
</P>
<P>
 Chimneys and fireplaces seem to sustain the most damage during earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 On the outside, check the chimney for any cracks in the bricks or mortar. 
There are usually some cracks in the chimney of an older house, but if there is 
any crack that really seems to be pulling apart, it may mean trouble, said Bill 
Hogue of Sierra Property Inspection in Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Also check to see if the fireplace or chimney has pulled away from the wall of 
the house. If there is a gap of more than one inch, do not light a fire before 
having the chimney inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogue also recommends climbing onto the roof to make sure the spark arrester 
has not been shaken off. Also make sure the flue liner, the clay pipe that 
usually rises a few inches above the chimney, has no noticeable cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The flue liner is designed to hold the heat within the chimney and not in the 
brick or wall, where it is a fire hazard. Is Foundation Cracked? 
</P>
<P>
 Check all along the bottom of the house and any other buildings for foundation 
cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts suggest that any crack more than one-eigth of an inch wide should be 
considered suspicious; if it is more than half an inch wide, it is serious and 
you may want to call a building inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a crack in the foundation visible from the outside, it may be wise 
to lift the carpet inside and see if the crack has opened into the house, Hogue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the house is on a raised foundation, the very least that should be done is 
to check in the crawl space under the house for any obvious dislodged posts. 
</P>
<P>
 A better move would be to crawl under the house, checking all joists and beam 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pay particular attention to see that the house is bolted to the foundation. 
If it is an older home that is not bolted to the foundation, keep in mind that 
a significant aftershock could knock it off its foundation," Carroll said. Do 
Windows and Doors Work? 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, check the tops of windows and doors for any cracks along the corners 
of the framing. But cracks alone are not an indication that there has been 
significant damage. Inside, check to see that all doors and windows still open 
and close the way they did before the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 If doors now open by themselves or stick, there was significant movement of 
the house that may be an indication of more serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Glass in sash windows is held with putty. Over time that putty can become 
brittle and break apart during a quake. "No broken glass does not necessarily 
mean the windows are OK," Carroll said. "A pane could be hanging in place by a 
thread and may need new putty." 
</P>
<P>
 Dislodged doors and windows are more likely to occur in homes with raised 
foundations because footings are more likely to shift, according to Beyers. Is 
There a Gas Leak? 
</P>
<P>
 You should always check immediately after a quake for gas leaks. Check again 
as you fully inspect your home for leaks you might have missed earlier. Besides 
checking the meter for leaks, check the gas stove and oven as well as a gas 
clothes dryer or water heater. If you detect a leak, take action right away. 
Shut off the gas and call the gas company ((800) 427-2200). If there is a 
strong smell of gas, leave the house immediately. Is Plumbing Broken? 
</P>
<P>
 The best to way to check for water leaks is to turn on the water. In the 
house, check under sinks, around the washing machine, dishwasher, tubs, showers 
and toilets. Outside, turn on the sprinkler system to make sure it still works. 
If it's not functioning properly, it could indicate a broken underground pipe. 
Has Attic Shifted? 
</P>
<P>
 Check for a shift in any rafters or joists, paying close attention to the 
chimney for any signs of daylight coming through, which would indicate it 
shifted. Look at the center board that runs the length of the roof and make 
sure it is still a tight fit. Are Pool and Spa Sound? 
</P>
<P>
 Check for leaks and cracks. Make a note of the water level and check it 
periodically for change that could indicate a leak in the mechanical system or 
a crack in the pool itself. 
</P>
<P>
 If the water line is higher on one end of the pool, it could indicate the 
ground has shifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Any electrical connections to pool or spa equipment should be checked to make 
sure they are still secure, Hogue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Check the tiles along the edge of the pool. If any makes a hollow sound when 
tapped with the end of a flashlight, it is loose. Is Water Heater Loose? 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure the water heater has not shifted and shaken loose any electrical 
connections or gas pipes. If the heater is strapped to the wall, make sure it 
is still secure. If it is not strapped, this is a good time to secure it to the 
wall. For More Information

CONSTRUCTION; WOOD IS INGRAINED IN JAPANESE HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roughly the size of California, Japan enjoys forest reserves on 68% of its 
land, yet the country imports 70% of its wood supply. 
</P>
<P>
 The imports satisfy the market for specialty woods beautiful enough to use in 
time-honored Japanese construction styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with today's emphasis on technology and concrete-and-steel construction, 
the tradition-minded Japanese who can afford a wood home insists on sugi, a 
cedar, and hinoki, a cypress, for interior millwork and trim. The specialty 
woods can't be hurried to maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 To create the poles of polished, figured sugi that define the tokonoma (place 
of honor) in a Japanese household, foresters wrap 20-year-old trees in colored 
plastic or with bamboo poles and elastic cords. 
</P>
<P>
 This eventually imprints shibo, a crinkle figure, in the wood grain and makes 
the wood more desirable at harvest. Such a post measuring 4-by-4-by-13 feet may 
be worth as much as $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 To satisfy less wealthy buyers, sugi is sliced into thin veneer and then 
applied to imported Douglas fir or pine timbers. The Japanese prefer even a 
veneer of their favored wood over a solid timber of any imported species. 
</P>
<P>
 To replace the native hinoki, once represented by vast forests felled during 
World War II, the country imports a similar cypress species from Taiwan and 
Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Other species have their historic place, too. There's keyaki, a hardwood that 
looks like elm, for cabinets and house construction. Tsugu, a yellowish spruce, 
dominates home frameworks. For roof beams, carpenters look to akamatsu, a red 
pine. Kashi, an oak, becomes cabinets and household implements. 
</P>
<P>
 Purely decorative elements, such as trim, can be made of momiji, a maple. 
Kiri, called royal paulownia in the United States where it has become 
naturalized, has always been made into boxes for storing precious belongings. 
That's because it swells airtight in the island nation's dampness. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, there's kuwa, a mulberry that's hard, durable and perfect for 
handles and door pulls.

<P>
 To extend their life, it's important to clean brushes, rollers and pads 
immediately after you finish painting. Here are some tips for your next paint 
project: Mid-Job Best Bets 
</P>
<P>
 If you take a short break from painting, you don't need to clean brushes, 
rollers or pads. Just wrap them in plastic food wrap. 
</P>
<P>
 To store a brush coated with latex paint overnight, drill a hole in the brush 
handle just above the metal band and insert a wire rod through it. Suspend the 
brush in water, making sure its bristles don't touch the bottom of the 
container. Cleaning Paintbrushes 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing vinyl gloves, place the paintbrush on newspaper and squeeze out as 
much excess paint as possible. Or brush the excess paint on newspaper until no 
more comes off. 
</P>
<P>
 Wash brushes used with water-base latex paint in warm water, adding a bit of 
dishwashing detergent. Work the paint out of the bristle with your fingers all 
the way to the metal band to loosen and dislodge remaining paint. Rinse under 
running water until the water runs clear. 
</P>
<P>
 For other paints, soak the brush in the appropriate solvent -- mineral spirits 
for oil-based paints, alcohol or lacquer thinner for shellac or alcohol-based 
stains or paints. Wash with detergent and warm water, then rinse well. 
</P>
<P>
 Most paint solvents are highly flammable. Don't store them in the house and 
don't leave open containers sitting around. Read container labels carefully for 
proper use. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a metal bristle-brush comb to dislodge any tenacious paint particles and 
to straighten out the inner bristles. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove excess liquid by shaking or spinning the handle rapidly -- brush down 
-- between the palms of your hands. Do it in a cardboard box if you want to 
contain the spray. 
</P>
<P>
 When the bristles are thoroughly dry, wrap the brush in brown grocery bag 
paper and secure with a rubber band. Store brushes flat or hang them up. 
Standing them will bend the bristles. Cleaning Rollers 
</P>
<P>
 Roll out excess paint on newspapers. Then slide the roller from its frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove latex paint from the roller with warm water. Immerse a roller used with 
alkyd paint in mineral spirits. Wear vinyl gloves if using solvent and work the 
nap between your fingers to get out any embedded paint. When the liquid becomes 
discolored, use fresh water or solvent. Wash in detergent and water and rinse 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Squeeze out excess water, checking that all signs of paint are gone. Rub the 
roller with a clean, absorbent cloth. Upend the roller on newspaper to dry. 
Wrap the dried roller in foil. Paint Pads 
</P>
<P>
 To clean a pad, first blot out as much paint as possible on newspaper. Then 
remove the pad from its holder. 
</P>
<P>
 Wash the pad in warm water if you were using latex. Wear rubber gloves and use 
mineral spirits to wash out alkyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Do a final wash in detergent or soap and water. Detergents containing ammonia 
are particularly effective on oil paints. Rinse thoroughly under running water. 
</P>
<P>
 Squeeze out excess water on newspapers and stand the pad on edge to dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrap the dry pad in brown paper or foil to keep it clean while stored. Salvage 
Tips 
</P>
<P>
 To soften a paintbrush that's stiff with dried latex paint, soak it in a 50-50 
solution of vinegar and water for 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Snip about an inch off the tip of an old paintbrush with ruined bristles and 
use it for dusting. Or cut the bristles to stubble -- about three-quarters of 
an inch long -- for a handy scrub brush.

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: FIRST, CHECK WATER HEATER PARTS FOR METAL 
FATIGUE IF PILOT LIGHT GOES OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: Our 11-year-old water heater works great, but during the past two 
months I've had to light the pilot light four times. There are no unusual 
drafts and it's fine otherwise. What could be the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 E.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "There are a couple of things it could be," says Ted Blanke of Central 
Plumbing & Heating Supply in La Mirada. "There's a part near the pilot called a 
thermocouple; it's a bimetal product, and anytime you get flame near a bimetal, 
it generates a millivolt of current. That current is transmitted into the mag 
assembly, which is basically a magnetic coil that keeps the pilot line open. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over time, the flame burning against the thermocouple causes metal fatigue, 
and not as much current is transmitted, cooling the mag assembly to the point 
where it shuts the pilot down. With a problem like this, the thermocouple is 
the place to start. Turn off the gas and try replacing it before checking on 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have adobe clay soil on the side of our house that gets sticky and mushy 
when it rains. What can we add to the soil to dry it up, since we are planning 
on cementing over it later this year? 
</P>
<P>
 K.K. 
</P>
<P>
 Oceanside 
</P>
<P>
 A: "You may want to just add a base of sand on top of the soil," says Ken 
Newland of Tustin Block. "This kind of soil expands when it gets wet and 
contracts when it dries out. Sand will thin it out and act as a cushion. You'll 
need to level out the clay as best as you can, then lay out the sand and pack 
it down before applying the cement mixture." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have a second home in the Rockies and we're experiencing a problem with 
roof leaks there. It was re-tarred last summer and there's no obvious problem 
with the sealed skylight in the center. I understand that a sealer can be 
applied to the roof that will prevent leaks. It slants only about 15 degrees, 
so if it needs to be replaced, what type of roof would work best? 
</P>
<P>
 J.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
 A: "I'd suggest staying away from some kind of sealing product," says Pete 
Gorman of Rancho Lumber in Westminster. "When you have a leaking roof and the 
shingles are in good shape, the problem can often be traced to the felt 
underlayment. As it deteriorates over time, the felt loses its seal and needs 
to be replaced. On expensive tile or shake roofs where the shingles are in good 
condition, a roofer can remove them carefully and replace them after changing 
the underlayment. With asphalt shingles, which are fine for your roof, you'll 
probably want to replace the shingles." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Last year we made an ugly mistake. We use those bowl cleaners that color 
the water in your toilet and during a problem with the tank in our downstairs 
bathroom, some of the blue water overflowed and dyed the gray carpeting around 
it. Household rug cleaners haven't worked, any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
 S.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 A: "People who put carpeting in bathrooms are in the same category as those 
who live in glass houses. Don't throw stones and don't use colored bowl 
cleaners," says carpet repairman Dave Greene of Santa Ana. "Eventually, water 
will get out of the tank and cause stains. If you get to it quick with a sponge 
or wet towels, you could dilute it enough to wipe it out. But if you've let it 
sit there for a while, it's probably in for good.  
</P>
<P>
 "Your best bet is to make a mat from a remnant of the carpeting or use a color 
that coordinates with the bathroom. The mat should fit all the way around the 
toilet, including under the sides of the tank. Ideally, it should be put in 
place immediately after the carpet is installed. Also use a mat in front of the 
counter, which is an area where you get toothpaste and mouthwash stains."

FURNISHINGS; ARCHITECTS FASHION PLYWOOD INTO AFFORDABLE ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An enduring modernist dream is to create great-looking furniture that is 
affordable. Elusive but not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent independent efforts by a couple of architects depend on plywood and a 
router, which can cut plywood into intricate shapes with the same apparent ease 
as scissors to paper. Silvio Russo, a New Yorker born and trained in Italy, 
designs storage units, room dividers and tables. Gregg Fleishman of Los Angeles 
cuts out Lumbarest chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Plywood, workhorse of the furniture industry, is made by gluing and pressing 
thin sheets of wood together, usually with the grain on one sheet at a right 
angle to the next. Its telltale edges generally are covered with veneer. In 
Russo's pieces, those edges are raw. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo's fanciful, colorful laminate-surfaced storage pieces, room dividers and 
tables are shipped flat. They are put together much like three-dimensional 
jigsaw puzzles. Little or no hardware is required. The precise shapes are made 
by a computer-controlled router programmed to make complicated cuts 
automatically. 
</P>
<P>
 A circular etagere consists of two interlocking vertical panels and six disks 
that form the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Small occasional tables can be taken apart when not in use. The pieces then 
can be hung on the wall as sculpture or strung together to form longer tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarter-circle bookcases can be placed together to form a half or 
three-quarter circle, thus creating a room within a room. Or they can be 
attached in reverse order like an undulating wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Perforated screens look like sheets of paper cut in geometric patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 The playful quality of the pieces isn't surprising. Russo says his inspiration 
comes from that popular childhood activity, cutting and folding paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The furniture is in happy colors," he adds. "The pieces are characters you 
bring home, like a friend." 
</P>
<P>
 The furniture, the Dipiu Collection, was named best new design at the most 
recent International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York. It is sold at 
Palazzetti stores in Dallas, New York, Philadelphia and Toronto. Prices range 
from $250 for a side table to $2,990 for a curved bookcase that measures 8 feet 
by 6 1/2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The more materials and steps in the manufacture of furniture, the more 
expensive it is to build, says Fleishman, whose plywood chairs require only one 
main process -- routing. There's no hardware and minimal sawing and sanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairs get their shape and their bounce from the numerous cuts he makes 
with a hand router. The wood itself becomes a flat, spring-like surface that 
accommodates the body and rocks lightly when someone sits down. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleishman's father, a chiropractor, put a chair in his office and asked his 
patients to submit names for it. Lumbarest was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairs are part of a series that Fleishman has been working on since 1984. 
Most of the pieces are made from a single sheet of plywood and assembled by 
bending and interlocking the parts. The Museum of Modern Art in New York 
recently bought one to add to its permanent collection. Others are at the Art 
Institute of Chicago and the Yale University Art Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairs are available through art galleries, though Fleishman also plans a 
studio and retail space in Culver City. Prices for the Lumbarest range from 
about $850 to $1,500, depending on finish and design. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men want to reduce waste and keep costs down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to simplify the making of furniture and other objects by 
eliminating complexity," Fleishman says. "We live in a culture with limited 
resources, and we have to start learning how to get more from less."

DO-IT-YOURSELF; TAKE STOCK OF THE HARD FACTS ON WOOD TYPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether you're planning to build a wooden deck, fence, gazebo or furniture, or 
to freshen the ones you have, you should know about wood types and treatments 
before you buy the first board or slather on a cure-all coating. 
</P>
<P>
 Each type of wood recommended for outdoor use has inherent qualities that 
affect its appearance and resistance to deterioration. Identifying these 
benefits and weaknesses will extend the life and beauty of your wooden 
structures: 
</P>
<P>
 * Choosing wood: Redwood, cedar and cypress are varieties most often 
recommended for outdoor use. Redwood and cedar are naturally rot- and 
insect-resistant, and they weather to beautiful shades of gray. Each withstands 
some effects of weathering, such as warping, but will require periodic 
treatment to look its best. Cedar costs 10% to 20% less and is stronger than 
redwood, but it isn't as tough as pressure-treated lumber. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pressure-treated wood: Fir, pine and other soft woods are sold 
pressure-saturated with preservatives that resist fungal decay and insects 
(especially termites). Pressure-treated wood is the densest, heaviest and 
strongest lumber you can buy, but it still needs protection from ultraviolet 
light and water damage. Some types are stained to resemble cedar or redwood, 
but most have a greenish cast that turns gray with exposure. Because it 
contains chemicals, treated wood needs careful handling and disposal. Consult 
your home center or lumberyard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maintaining wood: A deck must be clean, dry and free of mildew before 
treatment. Mildew can begin growing after only 10 days, so new wood needs 
cleaning, too. Packaged deck cleaners and brighteners will remove dirt, mold 
and mildew. Some types bleach the surface to restore the wood's natural color 
or to remove rust stains. Always follow the package directions and wear 
goggles, a mask and rubber gloves.  
</P>
<P>
 You can also clean and remove mildew from new wood using an equal mix of 
household bleach and water. Let the liquid sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then rinse 
thoroughly with water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water repellents, or sealants: These liquids form a transparent barrier 
against the moisture that causes mildew, decay, warping and discoloration. Some 
repellents, also called sealants, contain ingredients to block ultraviolet 
light, which fades wood's natural color to gray. Even pressure-treated wood 
needs help to combat the effects of water and sunlight. Ultraviolet light 
protectors can also be purchased separately. Repellents should be reapplied 
every year or so. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wood preservatives: Each formula fights a specific set of wood ailments, so 
check the label to make sure you're buying just the benefits you need. In 
general, preservatives offer transparent protection against decay, rot, fungal 
stains, wood-boring insects and ultraviolet light. These treatments should be 
applied to all untreated wood every one to two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wood stains: Stains are designed only to color wood; they do not protect it 
against the elements and should always be used in conjunction with a repellent 
or preservative treatment. Formulas include semitransparent stains, bleaching 
stains for a weathered-color look and other products that accent the wood's 
natural grain.

 Here are tips to keep your fireplace and chimney in good working order: 
</P>
<P>
 * Inspect the inside of your fireplace with a flashlight for loose bricks or 
gaps in the mortar. Also check the outside of the chimney also. If it passes 
through the house, inspect it wherever it's visible -- usually in the attic. 
Check for problems at least once a year and after earthquakes. Repair any 
defects. 
</P>
<P>
 * With the damper open, you should be able to look up the chimney and see 
daylight. If you can't, there may be an obstruction such as a bird nest that 
needs to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have the chimney cleaned once a year -- more often if you use it frequently 
or if you burn softwood. Creosote, a sticky black residue created by burning 
wood, is carried by the smoke and deposited in the chimney. It reduces the 
ability of the flue to draw off smoke. Because it is flammable, it can also 
cause a chimney fire. Call a professional chimney sweep to clean your chimney. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure a fireplace is equipped with andirons or a grate to permit air to 
flow beneath the blaze and a screen or glass doors to contain sparks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check the damper. This is the movable plate in the top of the fireplace 
that's kept open when a fire is burning; it's kept closed when there is no fire 
to minimize loss of room heat. If it's stiff, spray its hinge or pivot points 
with a silicone lubricant and work the handle until it moves freely. If it 
doesn't close completely, use a putty knife to remove deposits around it. If 
there are still gaps when it's shut, fill the spaces with furnace cement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once a year, clean the walls of the firebox with a dry bristle brush or the 
dusting attachment of the vacuum cleaner. (Be sure to wash and dry the 
attachment before using it on any other surface.) To remove heavy soot and 
grime, shave two 6 1/2-ounce bars of naphtha soap into a Dutch oven or 
stockpot. Pour in 3 quarts of hot water and heat until the soap dissolves. 
Remove from heat and let cool. Then stir in 1 1/2 pounds of powdered pumice and 
1 1/2 cups of household ammonia until the mixture is thoroughly combined. Brush 
the cleaner on with a paintbrush and let it stand about an hour. Then scrub off 
the mixture with a stiff brush and soap or liquid detergent. Rinse with a 
sponge and clear water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove ashes as soon as they're cold to prevent them from being spread 
throughout the house. One way to keep dust from rising is to sprinkle moist tea 
leaves over the ashes. Then, with the damper closed, gently sweep up as much as 
possible into a dustpan. To make the job easier, spread aluminum foil beneath 
the grate; when the ashes are cold, gather up the foil and discard it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clean the fireplace and hearth at least once a week during the months that 
you use it.

INTERIORS; RESEARCH IS 1ST STEP TOWARD ANY LOOK

 Decorating in a single authentic period style, whether it's Renaissance 
Revival or Gothic, is a real pleasure once you get started, and the rewards are 
especially rich with an old house, says Mimi Findlay, a decorator and antiques 
dealer who has specialized in older homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Before settling on a period decor, Findlay suggests a three-stage program: 
researching, budgeting and shopping for materials and artisans who know how to 
install the furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 While her experience centers on the older styles, the basic strategy can also 
be applied to more modern decors -- such as Craftsmen or Streamline. 
</P>
<P>
 You begin to get a feel for the right thing by visiting houses from the time 
period, especially those that haven't done a lot of restoration, she says. She 
also advises spending time studying period photographs.  
</P>
<P>
 For the older styles, reliable resources include "The Tasteful Interlude," by 
William Seale, published in 1981. She also recommends searching secondhand 
bookshops or visiting the library for copies of Charles Eastlake's "Hints on 
Household Taste" and Clarence Cook's "The House Beautiful." Both are popular 
advice books of the 19th and early 20th centuries.  
</P>
<P>
 Period decorating can be costly, especially if you want antique furniture 
rather than reproductions. If one of the formal Victorian and Aesthetic schemes 
so beloved in the 19th Century is too pricey, she suggests switching to a more 
countrified scheme that requires fewer elements and less costly furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually suggest to clients that we conform to the style of the house," she 
says, "or if it's a mixture of styles, as is so often the case, to the dominant 
theme or the one that they like best." 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to get the backgrounds right -- the wallpaper, floor coverings, 
window coverings and ceilings -- because these are the major elements of the 
room. There are some tricks to the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 19th Century did not match colors exactly as we do," Findlay says. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she says, they used a lot more gold than moderns would consider 
in good taste. Wallpaper and moldings were gilded, and gold threads were woven 
into upholstery.  
</P>
<P>
 They also mixed a variety of materials in one room. Side chairs were often 
done up in the same fabric, but each of the easy chairs might have a different 
covering. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical 19th Century wall treatment is complicated to the point of selecting 
and hanging up to nine patterns in one room. The lower wall, known as a dado, 
required one pattern, and the upper wall had another. Above that was a wide 
border known as a frieze. A narrow border where wall met ceiling, as well as 
several ceiling papers, were also common. 
</P>
<P>
 "The woodwork would not have been painted white but rather a fairly deep 
color," Findlay says. "All the colors and patterns have to be worked out so 
they go together and, of course, the carpet and wall coverings have to be 
compatible." 
</P>
<P>
 Get the backgrounds right, and the furniture will look its best.  
</P>
<P>
 Just as now, there were many options in furniture styles, from handmade to 
mass-produced and from formal to informal.  
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, people used old pieces with new, just as they do today.  
</P>
<P>
 Feel free to mix reproductions and pieces that are earlier and later, and 
don't be faint-hearted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clients are likely to get alarmed when the woodwork is painted," Findlay 
says. "When we add the complicated wall treatment, it's worse.  
</P>
<P>
 "But it all comes right when the furniture goes in and the pictures go up, 
provided you have skill, a sense of color coordination and a certain amount of 
taste."

MAINTENANCE; DON'T ALLOW METAL SURFACES TO RUST IN PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rust is the enemy of any iron, steel or galvanized metal you have in your 
home. It is an eyesore and if not removed or tested properly, rust can 
eventually destroy the metal it attacks. It can also stain adjacent painted 
surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that rust will attack through the smallest scratch or bare spot. It 
will then undercut the surface until the paint or other finish blisters, cracks 
and pops off. 
</P>
<P>
 Rust can be removed with a wire brush, a rotary wire brush attachment on an 
electric drill, a hand grinder, electric orbital sander, with commercial 
chemical compounds, and even with common household preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember to wear safety goggles and work gloves when using power tools; wear 
goggles, protective clothing, and rubber gloves when handling caustic chemicals 
or solvents such as kerosene or turpentine. How to Remove Rust 
</P>
<P>
 * Before repainting rusted areas, remove as much of the rust as possible, down 
to a firm metal surface. On metal surfaces, use a wire brush or an electric 
drill brush attachment. Then sand down to bare metal with medium-grit silicon 
carbide paper. You can use an orbital electric sander on flat surfaces. Finish 
with fine sandpaper or steel wool. 
</P>
<P>
 * On a large job, you can lessen your work by applying a rust converter -- a 
special primer that turns solid, well-bonded rust into a protective coating. 
First brush off loose rust flakes down to a solid surface. Then use an old 
paintbrush to apply the primer. Follow label directions to let it cure before 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
 * An electric hand grinder with a conical stone removes dime-size rust spots 
from metal without damaging the surrounding paint. Use it carefully to avoid 
penetrating the metal. Follow with primer and paint. 
</P>
<P>
 * To remove rust from wrought iron, rub with a kerosene-dampened cloth, then 
scour with extra-fine steel wool. If this fails, use a coarser grade of steel 
wool. 
</P>
<P>
 * To remove rust from unpainted metal furniture, scrub it with a cloth dipped 
in turpentine. You can also remove rust from iron or a tinned surface with a 
raw potato dipped in rottenstone polishing material. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stubborn rust on your tools? Rub them with a soap-filled steel-wool pad 
dipped in kerosene or turpentine. Finish them off by briskly rubbing with 
wadded aluminum foil. On small tools or other surfaces that are hard to sand, 
brush off as much rust as you can. Then apply a gel-like rust remover, 
carefully following label directions. 
</P>
<P>
 * On siding stained by nailheads, use sandpaper or steel wool to remove as 
much stain and rust as possible. Sink each nail with a nail set and fill the 
hole with putty, caulk or exterior spackling compound. Then prime the spots 
with a latex or shellac-based stain killer. Put two coats over flathead nails 
that can't be countersunk. Coat a rust stain on an interior wall with an 
alcohol-based primer; repeat if it bleeds through. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scrub a rust stain on concrete with a mix of half muriatic acid and half 
water. Handle cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
 * Soak a corroded bolt in a small container of vinegar for several days or 
until the rust begins to dissolve. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pour club soda over rusty nuts and bolts to loosen them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make a paste of cream of tartar and hydrogen peroxide and rub on rust stains 
in sinks and bathtubs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vinegar, lemon juice or hot pepper sauce can be used to remove rust in place 
of penetrating oil. To Prevent Rust 
</P>
<P>
 * Use only rust-proof aluminum, stainless steel or galvanized nails and screws 
in areas exposed to moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put a rust-resistant primer on any exposed metal piece; prime and point its 
hidden sides before installation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rub a few drops of light oil on hand tools, saw blades and drill bits before 
storing them. Never store tools in a damp basement or garage if you can avoid 
it.

SWARM OF AFTERSHOCKS HITS L.A.; THREAT OF RAIN SPURS RACE TO SET UP TENT

AT 55.

<P>
 Four powerful aftershocks hit the San Fernando Valley in an hour Friday as 
public parks swelled with new waves of the homeless and all of Los Angeles 
braced for yet another trial this weekend: rain. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pacific storm was expected to approach Southern California between Saturday 
and Monday, bringing the possibility of winds and as much as half an inch of 
rain. Many of the estimated 14,500 quake refugees sleeping in public parks and 
parking lots scrambled to buy protective gear, from ponchos to tarps large 
enough to cover an entire family. The National Guard raced to set up tent 
cities at six sites across the Valley, enough to shelter 6,000 people.  
</P>
<P>
 "Californians usually welcome rain," meteorologist Harry Woolford said. "But 
not this time. For many people, it couldn't be a worse weekend for rain." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as power was restored to virtually all of Los Angeles and the water was 
deemed safe to drink in some parts, the four powerful jolts at midmorning 
Friday reminded residents that this seismic dance was not over. The 
aftershocks, which ranged in magnitude from 4.0 to 4.6 and were centered three 
miles northwest of San Fernando, fit the expected pattern for a quake the size 
of Monday's early morning magnitude 6.6 shaker.  
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Police were used to maintain order at federal disaster centers overwhelmed 
by frustrated quake victims. A 12th center opened in Sherman Oaks, but lines 
were long and the red tape was thick. The director of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency promised to open six more centers by next week -- including 
one tomorrow in South-Central Los Angeles -- and President Clinton ordered 
centers staffed until 10 p.m. But on Friday, there were mostly long, angry, 
tearful queues to get appointments to see a relief worker days or weeks in the 
future. "We're living in our car," one woman cried plaintively as a FEMA worker 
begged for patience. 
</P>
<P>
 * The death toll in Los Angeles County rose to 55 as four more fatalities were 
reported by the coroner's office. All died on the day of the quake, but no 
other details were released. In San Bernardino County, an autopsy on Elizabeth 
Brace found that the Rancho Cucamonga mother widely reported to have died when 
she fell and hit her head on her child's crib during the quake had no broken 
bones. She may have died of excess adrenaline caused by fear, said Dr. Frank 
Sheridan, the county's chief medical examiner. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles Unified School District said that it will open all but 97 of 
its hardest hit campuses Tuesday. The schools to remain closed indefinitely are 
all in the West Valley, Supt. Sid Thompson said. School authorities are hoping 
that safe portions of those campuses, where more than 100,000 students are 
enrolled, can be opened soon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mayor Richard Riordan said he will urge businesses to stagger work schedules 
and use four-day weeks and telecommuting to alleviate traffic jams. Such 
measures were highly successful in preventing tie-ups during the 1984 Los 
Angeles Olympics. Ramps connecting the Glendale and Ventura freeways were 
closed so engineers could inspect damage from the aftershocks. Transportation 
officials came to the grim conclusion Friday that alternate routes can handle 
only 60% of the traffic being diverted from broken freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of uninhabitable buildings in Los Angeles reached 1,175 as 
inspectors continued to fan out through the city. The red- and yellow-tagged 
structures encompass 4,800 housing units. The city pledged to demolish 
buildings at no cost to owners and to pick up street rubble in the Valley this 
weekend if residents will place it at the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles Police Department said it would stay fully mobilized at 
least through the weekend, keeping officers on 12-hour shifts with no days off. 
Although officers report that crime has been remarkably low since the quake, 
they are busy assisting the displaced and patrolling ravaged area to guard 
against looters. 
</P>
<P>
 * The federal government, which normally covers such emergency assistance 
costs as police, firefighting and water delivery for the first 72 hours after a 
disaster, announced Friday that it will pay such expenses for an additional 
five days -- through Jan. 25 -- and possibly longer if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Friday also brought promises from politicians at every level of government 
about expediting aid. Henry Cisneros, secretary of the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, said he will speed up approval of $83 million in 
housing vouchers, low-interest loans and other quake aid. State legislators 
promised to introduce bills to increase tax deductions for earthquake damage 
and speed unemployment benefits. And the City Council asked the Department of 
Water and Power to find a way to offer customers in the quake zone discounts or 
payment deferrals on their water and electric bills if their homes were damaged 
or destroyed. The Next Test 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles struggled toward recovery Friday in fits and starts that felt like 
one step forward and two steps back. Electricity was restored to virtually all 
of the city; only a handful of customers remained without power. 
</P>
<P>
 But 20,000 customers from the Valley to the Santa Monica Mountains were still 
without water. Tap water south of the Santa Monica Mountains was declared safe 
to drink without being boiled, but water supplied north of Sunset Boulevard was 
expected to remain unsafe at least through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came word of possible rain. The weather's unfortunate turn came as 
inspectors declared building after building uninhabitable and the newly 
homeless headed to parks and parking lots for a place to sleep. The encamped 
population climbed from 13,800 to about 14,500. Forecasters warned that a storm 
700 miles off the Northwest coast and heading east could cause trouble for Los 
Angeles, pushing a cold front through the area and posing a 40% chance of light 
rain.  
</P>
<P>
 Working frantically to beat the storm, emergency workers scrambled Friday to 
convince earthquake victims to leave city parks.  
</P>
<P>
 Huge National Guard tents such as those used to shelter people who lost homes 
in Hurricane Andrew had been delivered and were were being erected for 
emergency shelter. The sites selected as of Friday were Lanark Recreation 
Center in Canoga Park, Reseda Recreation Center, Valley Plaza Recreation 
Center, North Hollywood Park, West Valley Park and Winnetka Recreation Center 
in Northridge. GTE also has donated a tent in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the tents, 32 Red Cross centers were housing thousands. But 
efforts to clear the parks stalled despite the presence of "reassurance teams" 
that fanned out to urge people to leave their camps and head to city shelters. 
Although some of those who were camped out took that advice, new arrivals 
outnumbered them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is big," said Geoffrey Garfield, an aide to Mayor Richard Riordan. "It's 
our major effort right now. . . . We have to get the people out of these 
encampments." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to put up the tents was made reluctantly and only after city 
officials became convinced that there was no other way to protect dislocated 
people from the coming rains. After Hurricane Andrew hit Florida, the tent 
cities became near-permanent encampments, and it took the concentrated efforts 
of law enforcement agencies to ultimately force some people out of the tents. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Riordan and other city officials recommended Friday that the 
tents go up before the rain arrives, possibly Saturday night or early Sunday 
morning. The storm is expected to taper off to scattered showers by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people may get the feeling they can stay there permanently," Riordan 
conceded. "But with the rains coming, we have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
 As the weather reports predicted an uncomfortable weekend, residents kept a 
wary eye on the darkening sky and hunted down provisions. Outside the Home 
Depot in Canoga Park, Billaldo Jeronimo held up his new tarp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sleep outside in the parking lot of our apartment," said the 18-year-old, 
who has been living in a makeshift camp in North Hills with his wife and 
6-month-old son. "On Saturday, they say it will rain and we will have only 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Welsh of Canoga Park also shopped for gear, just hoping to stay dry. When 
asked what he would do if faced with the choice of getting wet or re-entering 
his quake-damaged home, he replied: "I'm taking the rain outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as phone calls deluged the Valley from throughout the world, 
Pacific Bell officials in the company's Northridge processing center struggled 
to repair roofs that could leave equipment exposed to the weekend rains. The 
center is handling 12 million calls a day, 7 million more than normal. More 
Aftershocks 
</P>
<P>
 At times there is a sense that the city could handle almost anything, even the 
rain, if the shaking would only stop. The swarm of aftershocks that hit at 
midmorning Friday sent the already shellshocked diving for cover for a fifth 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 The earth's rocking set off a fire at a collapsed apartment building on 
Victory Boulevard in Reseda when the shaking caused a car trapped beneath the 
building to ignite, Los Angeles City Fire Chief Mike Littleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the aftershocks moving things around, the car's frayed wires rubbed 
together and ignited the fire which spread to the building," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze was controlled in less than an hour -- even though the building was 
deemed too dangerous for firefighters to venture inside. Residents were moving 
their belongings out of another condemned building nearby when National Guard 
troops began yelling "Fire! Fire!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and my mom dropped what we were carrying and ran out of the building," 
Charla Pang said wearily. "All we want to do is get our stuff into storage and 
then find a place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Following the aftershocks, Cal State Northridge President Blenda Wilson 
announced that all 53 of the major structures on campus would have to be 
reinspected before a final damage assessment is made. Until Friday, engineers 
had been prepared to announce that 80% of the buildings had made it through the 
temblor and its initial aftershocks without debilitating structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus may reopen by Feb. 14, two weeks later than the scheduled start of 
the new semester. "We might have to hold classes in trailers, community 
education buildings, churches and community agencies," Wilson said. Burying the 
Dead 
</P>
<P>
 As the earth kept rumbling, Los Angeles residents began the grim task of 
burying the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Fichtner, the first quake victim to be laid to rest, was interred in blue 
jeans and a flannel shirt given to him by residents of the Chatsworth Lake 
neighborhood who had adopted him 10 years ago when he was homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Fichtner died inside the donated camper in which he lived on a Van Nuys street 
when a microwave oven fell and struck him in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours later, 4-year-old Amy Tyre-Vigil was remembered in a service at a 
Reseda temple. Her short life was filled with promise and possessions -- 
different from Fichtner's in many ways -- but it ended within minutes of his 
when her parents' affluent Sherman Oaks hillside house collapsed around her.  
</P>
<P>
 The casualty count from the earthquake continued to rise Friday and hospital 
officials expressed alarm about the dwindling number of beds in county 
intensive care units. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the beds for the most acutely ill, people on life support who need 
24-hour care. There are 1,750 such beds in the county, but only 216 remained 
unoccupied as of midday Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're becoming concerned," said David Langness, a spokesman for the Hospital 
Council of Southern California. He said hospitals in San Bernardino, Ventura 
and Orange counties have been put on alert. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the usual run of heart attacks, difficult pregnancies and other 
patients with potential life-threatening diseases, county hospitals have had to 
cope with nearly 1,300 patients admitted for earthquake-related injuries, some 
of them in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the problem are the 915 patients who were evacuated from more than 
two dozen quake-damaged hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hospitals remained totally shut down: St. Johns Hospital and Health 
Center in Santa Monica, the Veterans Administration Hospital in Sepulveda, and 
the Psychiatric Hospital in the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center Complex. 
Many others were operating at reduced levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hospital Council of Southern California said that 6,547 patients had been 
treated and released from hospitals since Monday's quake and that 1,292 
patients were admitted for treatment. Government Tries to Help 
</P>
<P>
 Friday also brought more promises from government officials who say they are 
expediting aid to quake victims, but it could be weeks before housing and other 
forms of emergency aid will be distributed by disaster centers. 
</P>
<P>
 About $83 million in federal money that was to arrive in July for job training 
and low-income housing construction primarily in South-Central Los Angeles will 
be delivered immediately. A total of $200 million will be available throughout 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Hernandez and other city officials praised Cisneros for moving 
quickly to respond to the city's needs. "It's the kind of stuff that we didn't 
get during the civil disturbances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs said Cisneros has been "remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
 A bill passed by the Legislature and signed into law Thursday night by Gov. 
Pete Wilson extends the arraignment period for criminal suspects from 48 hours 
to seven days. The legislators said such a move was necessary because there are 
several quake damaged courthouses where arraignments can not take place. The 
bill will expire after 30 days.

 After freeways tumbled in Monday's quake, the Baskin-Robbins ice cream chain 
began letting many of its Glendale headquarters employees set their own hours. 
Meanwhile, people such as consultant Gary Saenger of Canyon Country grudgingly 
decided to give telecommuting a try. 
</P>
<P>
 With traffic disrupted and many offices damaged, Angelenos are changing the 
way they work. More are operating out of their homes, paving electronic 
highways with personal computers, modems and fax machines. Others, with their 
bosses' blessings, are juggling work schedules and chucking rigid workplace 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 In post-quake Los Angeles, it is definitely not business as usual. And, some 
workplace experts and government officials say, surprise benefits might emerge 
from all the disruption. As destructive and terrifying as it was, the 
earthquake has provided sprawling, vehicle-fixated Southern California with a 
rare opportunity to reshape how, where and when its residents do their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The key ingredients for change have converged: Traffic nightmares, 
technological advances and stringent new air emission laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise fixes now could ease smog, traffic snarls and the general stresses of 
life for years to come, experts say, even after roads and offices have been 
rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 But will Los Angeles seize this opportunity? Will the jolting Northridge 
temblor shake up work habits forever, or simply result in Band-Aid measures 
that will fade once the crisis has passed? 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bay Area, still suffering disruptions four years after the 
7.1-magnitude Loma Prieta temblor, can be a guide, chances are good that there 
will be dramatic shifts now and subtle, yet profound, changes in the long term. 
Companies Respond 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Loma Prieta quake, some companies expanded programs to 
encourage telecommuting, flexible hours and car-pooling. Given the even greater 
destruction here, Southern Californians can look forward to more extensive 
changes, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously have a year to several years ahead of us in dealing with the 
earthquake, and we've got to come up with creative and non-traditional 
solutions," said Susan Herman, top telecommunications official for the city of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce de Terra, a state transportation planner, said: "(The quake) will allow 
people and their employers, who are skeptical, to sample the changes. 
Eventually, what you will see are permanent changes in the way people conduct 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, city, county and state officials are working with Pacific 
Bell, GTE California, telecommunications experts and big employers to craft a 
major telecommuting initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Many details remain sketchy, but officials will try to encourage more workers 
to telecommute from home or from "telecenters" -- offices equipped with 
computers, faxes and phones -- close to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan is planning to announce today an effort 
modeled on the successful traffic reduction program used during the 1984 
Olympics that calls for telecommuting, four-day workweeks and staggered hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, though, calls from employers interested in office space for 
telecommuters are pouring into the Antelope Valley Telebusiness Center, a 
year-old, county-run office center for employees who want to work close to 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 That is quite a change from the initial response: Until this week, only about 
15 of the 20 workstations available to telecommuters were being used. Habits 
Die Hard 
</P>
<P>
 Before any changes are made, workers can expect plenty of tension between new 
realities and long-entrenched traditions dictating how -- and where -- 
employees do their work. Although many bosses still want face-to-face contact 
with their staff, they will have to adjust to the changes brought on by the 
traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fascinating test case of the whole notion of flexibility," said 
workplace consultant Charles Rodgers, with Work/Family Directions in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some experts say Angelenos will return to their old driving habits 
once the freeways are repaired, others contend that the roadways will be out of 
commission long enough for many to learn to love such options as telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend is toward telecommuting, and an earthquake can't help but move that 
along," said Joanne H. Pratt, a Dallas-based management consultant who focuses 
on using technology to enhance productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 For some employees, telecommuting can be as simple as having a pad of paper 
and a telephone. Others require sophisticated workstations, with PCs, modems, 
faxes and phones. Cellular phones and hand-held devices that can send and 
receive information make desks obsolete and have given rise to a new term -- 
virtual office -- to describe the mobile workplace of those on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many experts lobby for telecommuting and flexible work schedules, few 
employees have tried them when given the chance. That is true even among 
working parents who say they need flexible schedules to handle family demands. 
A survey released last year by Work/Family Directions, focusing on 80 big U.S. 
companies that offer such options, found that fewer than 2% of employees used 
the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is economic, Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 People fear that if they adopt a flexible work schedule, "they'll be written 
off" by their bosses, losing out on raises, promotions or maybe their jobs, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some employees fear the 'out of sight, out of mind' phenomenon," said Paula 
Ramsey, a regional manager for Commuter Transportation Services, a Los Angeles 
nonprofit group.  
</P>
<P>
 Saenger, the management consultant, had resisted telecommuting because for 
competitive reasons he has always wanted to dart over to his clients as soon as 
they called him -- something far easier to do from his main office in Pasadena 
than from his rustic home in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that his drive time to work has more than tripled, Saenger has decided 
to give working from home a shot. "That's the reality now," Saenger said. "It's 
going to have to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many experts predict that, even after the freeways are repaired, workers 
who found unexpected benefits in telecommuting or staggered work hours will 
stick with them. Higher Productivity 
</P>
<P>
 Workplace specialists say productivity usually skyrockets when workers try 
telecommuting or so-called compressed workweeks, working 40 hours over four 
days or 80 hours over nine days. Telecommuters often find there are fewer 
distractions at home, and workers taking advantage of flexible work situations 
are less likely to quit or take sick time.  
</P>
<P>
 Some major employers, including Hollywood studios Sony, Disney and 
MCA/Universal, talked to government agencies this week about making greater use 
of telecommuting. Woodland Hills-based Health Net, the state's second-biggest 
health maintenance organization, is lining up telecenters for employees in 
Valencia and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, it is difficult to promote such services to corporate and 
government employers. "We can't seem to get middle managers to understand that 
you are going to benefit from these programs," said Nancy Apeles Eiser, 
transportation program manager for Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "But once you get over that hump, there is no stopping them," she added. "They 
see all the reasons why it makes good business sense and that they should have 
been doing it all along." 
</P>
<P>
 Eiser figures it is a matter of time. "Now that the need is really there, 
given the earthquake situation, it seems like the natural thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Northridge quake's aftermath, government officials have called for 
measures such as compressed workweeks to ease traffic problems. The Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors passed a motion Tuesday calling for county 
department heads to encourage workers to telecommute. Matter of Survival 
</P>
<P>
 When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck south of San Francisco on Oct. 17, 
1989, flexibility became a matter of survival for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor knocked out a section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, 
destroyed or damaged freeways feeding into downtown San Francisco, collapsed a 
double-decker viaduct in Oakland and caused massive rockslides on a winding 
stretch of mountain road from Santa Cruz into Silicon Valley. The region's 
crisscross commuting patterns were thoroughly tangled. 
</P>
<P>
 Many big employers -- notably Hewlett-Packard, Bechtel, Pacific Bell, Chevron, 
Pacific Gas & Electric and Bank of America -- started employee transit 
subsidies, moved to more flexible scheduling or encouraged telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit agencies added ferry service from Oakland and Alameda to San 
Francisco, beefed up service on BART, started a bus route over the Santa Cruz 
Mountains and expanded car-pooling services. Overnight, there was a dramatic 
shift to public transit, and ride-sharing programs nearly doubled.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though highway traffic is nearly back to pre-quake levels, BART has shown 
an impressive gain of more than 20% in ridership over pre-quake levels, and 
some companies did make fundamental workplace changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bechtel Inc., a San Francisco engineering firm with traditional 9-to-5 values, 
allowed employees to stagger their start and stop times immediately after the 
quake. When key bridges and roads returned to service and the company tried to 
go back to its old ways, an employee outcry prompted rethinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized it seemed to be working," said Tim Green, manager of employee 
relations. "It helped people with child care and commuting." Staggered 
scheduling became policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies said the quake had no long-term effect. A spokesman at Bank of 
America, which had developed a flextime policy before the 1989 quake, said the 
earthquake did not cause a "permanent uptick" in people taking advantage of the 
option. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack M. Nilles, a Brentwood-based consultant credited with coining the term 
"telecommute" in 1973 while he was stuck in freeway gridlock, views working 
from home or satellite offices as a business imperative in post-quake Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he noted that at some companies it might take years to adopt 
permanent changes "because it requires cultural change and, unlike an 
earthquake, that doesn't happen instantaneously." 
</P>
<P>
 Absent a disaster such as an earthquake, businesses usually try telecommuting 
because it reduces the need for costly office space and increases productivity. 
By Nilles' calculation, employers save an average of $8,000 a year for each 
mid-level employee who telecommutes regularly. Easing Traffic 
</P>
<P>
 Nilles estimates that easily half the work force in Los Angeles could 
telecommute at least twice a month, easing traffic congestion dramatically. 
During the 1984 Olympics, which brought an estimated 2 million visitors to Los 
Angeles, the streets remained unclogged even though car-pooling and other 
efforts reduced traffic just 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive recruiter Gary Kaplan, who owns a Pasadena firm with eight 
employees, said he is open to having employees do more phone work from home, 
although he admits to having reservations about how productive people are if 
they "aren't under your thumb." 
</P>
<P>
 He also is looking into renting a furnished apartment near the office and 
letting employees take turns using it during the workweek. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come upon a time where we have to stay loose," Kaplan said. "It might 
not be possible to continue operating the way we've been operating."

QUAKE DEALS RIOT AREAS ANOTHER DISASTROUS BLOW; AFTERMATH: MANY HOMES AND 
BUSINESSES ARE DECLARED UNSAFE IN NEIGHBORHOODS STILL REELING FROM 1992 UNREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 During the 1992 riots, the Messiah Baptist Church served as a safe harbor, 
dispensing food and clothing and offering a secure place to sleep as chaos 
raged outside in the Crenshaw district. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, the reverberations of an earthquake centered 20 miles to the 
north have forced city building inspectors to shut down the West Adams 
Boulevard structure, which suffered nasty cracks in its hefty bell tower and a 
collapsed ceiling and chimney in its fellowship hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took care of hundreds here in 1992," said the Rev. Kenneth J. Flowers. 
"Now, if push comes to shove, we'll have to end up holding our Sunday services 
in a tent." 
</P>
<P>
 While most government and media attention to the earthquake has focused on the 
San Fernando Valley, hundreds of structures in Southwest and South-Central Los 
Angeles also were struck and left unsafe for occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are institutions at the core of the city's African American 
community. Messiah Baptist, Southern Missionary Baptist Church, Bethany Baptist 
Church, the Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theatre and offices of the Family 
Savings and Founders National banks have been shut down, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Also closed because of earthquake damage were numerous stores and offices in 
the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, including the Governor's Business 
Revitalization Center, which was created after the riots to assist victimized 
businesses seeking state government permits to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the period of the riots, when fires and looting were mainly limited to 
business blocks, this week's earthquake has also struck home -- literally -- in 
many residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 At the north end of the Crenshaw district, dozens of small bungalows and 
Spanish-style homes suffered significant structural damage -- severed 
foundations, toppled chimneys and jagged cracks in the walls. At noon Friday, 
many residents remained without gas or water service and had not yet been paid 
a visit by city Department of Building and Safety inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole house slipped off the foundation," sighed Robert Petite, 81, who has 
lived on West 28th Street since the early 1950s. "I'm still living here but I 
don't know if my house is livable.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying to get a city inspector to look, but I just get a busy 
signal when I call," said the retired chef, who cowered in the bedroom closet 
of his wood-frame home for 30 minutes after the earthquake struck.  
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner on Vineyard Avenue, Sagas Tome, who is eight months 
pregnant, and 11 relatives were spending the nights in a creaky, unheated 
plywood garage because they feared that the heavily damaged apartment building 
next door to their house will collapse in the next strong aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you the building inspector?" Tome asked a reporter. "Everyone here is 
living in fear."  
</P>
<P>
 With residents and business owners across Los Angeles still making inspection 
requests late this week, city building officials had planned to add 100 
inspectors to their crews Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said it was inexcusable 
that homes in South-Central Los Angeles had not yet been inspected. "No one 
should be waiting for an inspector at this point," said the councilman, whose 
district includes the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary estimates indicate at least $6.9 million in damage to 268 
structures in neighborhoods of central Los Angeles, including those south of 
the Santa Monica Freeway. But the figures are certain to skyrocket as building 
inspectors continue their survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas estimated that well over 1,000 South-Central Los Angeles 
residents have been left without housing. At Jim Gilliam Park alone, more than 
300 people have been sleeping outdoors each night, many of them residents of 
damaged 1950s-era apartment buildings in the Baldwin Village neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of the untold earthquake story," said the councilman, who is 
co-sponsoring an earthquake preparedness and recovery exposition this morning 
at the Crenshaw Christian Center. "There was just no hiding place from this 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Other neighborhoods of central Los Angeles that were hit hard in the 1992 
riots also suffered damage in the earthquake, among them Koreatown, Pico-Union 
and East Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our wall split open like cooked popcorn," said Gloria Salinas, who lives in a 
single-bedroom Koreatown apartment with her husband and three children. "No one 
was hurt, but we were all so scared. We don't want to go back in." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some Korean American businessmen whose stores were looted in the 
riots have now suffered a double blow, according to Korean American attorney 
and activist Angela Oh. "These businesses have already been suffering because 
the economy is so bad," she said. "And many of these Korean families live out 
in the Northridge area." 
</P>
<P>
 On South Figueroa Avenue near the Los Angeles Sports Arena, which itself has 
been closed temporarily as a safety precaution, four buildings have been judged 
unsafe by building inspectors. In a parking lot, 30 residents camped under 
makeshift tents. "I don't know what we're going to do," said building manager 
Luz Ruiz, who is pregnant and has seven children. "They say it's going to rain 
this weekend. . . . My children are already sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Along major thoroughfares of Southwest Los Angeles, where inspections had been 
made to most stricken churches and businesses by late Thursday, many of the 
brick-facade buildings judged unsafe were those that had undergone costly 
earthquake reinforcement during the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We reinforced for over $200,000 in 1992," said Lula Washington, director of 
the Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theatre, whose West Adams Boulevard 
headquarters now features a 30-foot-long hole in the wall of its second-floor 
rehearsal hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw this building, I almost collapsed myself," she said. "And then 
today, ironically, we had to pay our fire insurance. We sent out a check to 
protect a building that we can't use." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington hopes to receive enough federal aid and contributions to make an 
estimated $100,000 in repairs to the hall, a 69-year-old former Masonic Temple. 
She is also scrambling to find rehearsal space for her dance company, an 
after-school "I Do Dance, Not Drugs," program and tumbling program for 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of activities that will be displaced," Washington said. "And we 
don't have any money." 
</P>
<P>
 At the corporate office of the Founders National Bank on Martin Luther King 
Boulevard, beams are cracked and the bank's sign lies in the bushes. Repairs 
will cost an estimated $600,000 and take six months, with the office 
temporarily moved to branches in the Crenshaw Plaza Shopping Center and 
Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 Family Savings Bank's main office in the 3600 block of Crenshaw Boulevard was 
closed when it was flooded by a fire safety sprinkler system triggered by the 
temblor. The bank plans to set up temporary facilities in its parking lot 
within three weeks while repairs are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the worst-hit building in South-Central L.A. was the Southern 
Missionary Baptist Church, whose congregants spent $250,000 on earthquake 
reinforcement repairs three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question we'll have to tear it down," said the Rev. J. L. Gates, 
who was dressed in a gray suit and a white hard hat, with a tape measure 
dangling from his belt. "We made it through the (Rodney King beating) trials, 
but the tribulations got us." 
</P>
<P>
 At Bethany Baptist, on Martin Luther King Boulevard, where a railing now hangs 
off the side of the sanctuary, Sunday services have been rescheduled at Dorsey 
High School. And at Messiah Baptist, Flowers was still wavering between a tent 
in the parking lot and a Jewish temple in Hollywood with which his church has a 
covenant relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting for a structural engineer to arrive to determine the extent of 
the bell tower damage, Flowers reflected that the earthquake -- in the wake of 
rioting, flooding and fires -- represented a wake-up call from above. "I think 
God is speaking to get our attention, to say that we need to recognize that he 
is still in control and in charge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, the message concerning quake damage in Southwest Los Angeles has not 
yet reached much of the world, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People from back East call and they don't know that we were even affected by 
the earthquake. Yes we were, we felt it big time." 
</P>
<P>
 But the message from above certainly made an impact on the altar of Messiah 
Missionary, Flowers added, citing a stained glass representation of the Holy 
Spirit that was shaken loose. 
</P>
<P>
 "A brick came down," he said, "and sent the Holy Spirit right into the piano."

MOST SCHOOLS TO OPEN TUESDAY; 97 REMAIN SHUT; EDUCATION: 100,000 STUDENTS WILL 
STAY AT HOME. THOUSANDS WILL HAVE TO USE MAKESHIFT CLASSROOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The mammoth Los Angeles Unified School District, struggling mightily to 
recover from the quake that pummeled about 300 campuses and kept all schools 
closed for a week, will reopen all but 97 of its hardest-hit campuses Tuesday, 
Supt. Sid Thompson announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those 97 schools -- all in the San Fernando Valley west of the San Diego 
Freeway -- are closed indefinitely and their 100,000 students will stay home 
until further notice. School authorities are hoping that safe portions of those 
campuses can be opened soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although at least 1,000 classrooms have been lost to quake damage, officials 
believe that no school site will be permanently closed. But thousands of 
children are going to find themselves in makeshift classrooms -- such as 
offices and auditoriums -- or, as a last resort, transferred to another campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson cautioned that these plans can change as fast as the jolt of the next 
aftershock. More tremors will force inspectors again to survey schools, 
possibly leading to changes in school opening plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need you to keep your patience. I know it is trying. You want to 
get your kids in school, you want to get them some good supervision," Thompson 
said of the district's weeklong shutdown. "But our No. 1 priority is safety, 
and then getting kids back for an education. What this is about is safety." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, all school employees -- even those who work at the 97 severely 
damaged West Valley schools -- are to report to work at the district's 800 
sites, including 640 elementary and secondary campuses, adult schools, day-care 
centers and continuation schools. Teachers and staff are preparing 
quake-related lessons and may be asked to help with light cleanup work before 
the schoolyard gates open Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the classrooms to be ready for the children. These young people have 
been through a terrible trauma already. We don't need to bring them into 
surroundings that show that trauma," Thompson said. "We will try to make it 
reasonably secure and reasonably attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Staff at West Valley campuses, which take in thousands of students from 
overcrowded, inner-city schools, will meet with inspectors to discuss how long 
it may take to get at least a portion of their schools in shape.  
</P>
<P>
 "The damage in the central and West Valley is severe, but we believe that we 
will be able to operate parts of those campuses," Thompson said. "We do not 
believe at this time that we have a school (that is) totally inoperative." 
</P>
<P>
 Reopening plans will be confirmed Monday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
 The decision to reopen schools Tuesday came as district officials received 
their first public pledges of aid from state and federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * About 400 portable classrooms are being rushed to the district from state 
warehouses and about half can be in place within two weeks. The state will pay 
for the delivery and installation. 
</P>
<P>
 * About $168 million in school construction bonds may be available to all 
hard-hit school districts, including schools in the Santa Clarita Valley and 
Ventura County. Los Angeles has the option of diverting up to $30 million 
slated for school construction to rebuilding efforts, state education officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The U.S. Department of Education has made $10 million immediately available 
to Los Angeles and other districts to help cover emergency operating expenses, 
such as transportation, counseling and food service. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley is scheduled to tour damaged schools 
Sunday. In Washington on Friday, he promised that his department "is fully 
committed to making sure that we do everything necessary to help restore the 
Los Angeles schools." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said he is prepared to ask for more federal school money. "The 
earthquake has disrupted our lives, but we cannot allow it to disrupt our 
children's education," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Both federal and state officials promise to bring more inspectors and 
architects to the school district for continued inspections and longer-term 
reconstruction plans. The Department of Water and Power has sent 20 structural 
engineers to help the district, which has only six inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt told the Los 
Angeles Board of Education that his agency "will do everything we can to 
expedite funds to schools. . . . I'm here to reassure you we are here for the 
long haul." 
</P>
<P>
 He could not say what portion of the district's estimated $500 million to $700 
million in damage the federal government will be able to meet, but said schools 
will be figured prominently in recovery plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The rush of aid to schools comes after educators expressed concern that 
freeway repairs were receiving higher-level attention than school 
reconstruction, raising fears that an already battered public education system 
would be shortchanged in the quake recovery effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope state and federal officials will hold to their pledges to the 
children of this city," said school board President Leticia Quezada. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a spirit of cooperation that school authorities are trying to promote 
during this emergency, cracks have emerged as leaders of two of the district's 
employee unions complained about their members having to report to work the day 
after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Eli Brent, head of the principals and administrators union, said managers were 
treated "insensitively and unfairly" when they were ordered to conduct 
inspections of their schools in potentially unsafe buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of the union representing clerical workers, janitors and other 
staff called their members the "unsung heroes" and complained that their 
efforts were not appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 Several parents who attended the board hearing were upset by the comments, 
saying that now is the time to put aside labor strife and concentrate on the 
welfare of the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Self-interests have to be secondary now," said Deidre Simien, 43. "If the 
structures are safe, if the schools are safe, we need to get our children back 
in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of needy and traumatized students and teachers will flow back to 
campus next week. For many who lost homes, classrooms will offer them their 
first shelter in more than a week and the cafeteria will serve up their first 
hot meal.

 "This is affecting everyone, even some of my teachers are homeless now," said 
Jay Peterman, principal of Frost Middle School in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 400 teachers at Valley campuses have been left homeless by the quake 
and may not be able to return to work. School officials estimate that about 
half the teaching force lives in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, 
which may mean delays in getting to school or missing work altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Help has begun to pour in from businesses and other school districts. Aetna 
Government Health Plans donated $50,000 and BASS, a ticket sales firm, has 
given $5,000 for books lost in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said the Las Virgenes, Alhambra and Montebello school districts have 
offered to take in students until the damaged Los Angeles schools are fixed.

WEARY QUAKE VICTIMS TIED UP IN RED TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Thousands of bone-weary earthquake victims, whose hopes lifted when Clinton 
Administration officials arrived promising quick delivery of emergency housing 
vouchers, were bitterly disappointed Friday to find that it could be days -- 
even weeks -- before housing or other forms of emergency aid will be provided 
by disaster centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Government leaders struggled to cut through a thicket of bureaucratic delays 
and unravel a potentially embarrassing recovery snafu. By day's end, there were 
signs of progress as hastily accelerated paperwork processing resulted in a few 
lucky quake victims receiving the first of 10,000 certificates that will 
guarantee them help in paying rent. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight hours in line, Felicia Jefferson was the first to receive a 
housing certificate from the Van Nuys disaster relief center, which promises to 
pay 70% of her $900 rent for the next 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working and paying taxes for 18 years now," said the mother of twin 
toddlers. "I've never been in a situation where I needed to ask for help, but I 
really need it now so I'm not embarrassed or tucking my head or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the 12 disaster assistance centers were overwhelmed by the 
enormity of the relief need. In many cases, emotions flared as victims learned 
that they may have to wait until next month for an appointment to apply for 
housing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 At midmorning, those coping with the bureaucratic headaches were further 
unnerved by twin magnitude 4.6 aftershocks. At the aid site closest to the 
epicenter, in Winnetka Park, several applicants scooted under tables. Sensing 
impending panic, one person shouted: "Calm down!" Others held hands and prayed. 
Some wept. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the chaos at a center in Northridge was a shortage of 
Spanish-speaking workers. Officials said FEMA's office in Puerto Rico was 
sending workers to ease the problem; 1,000 people standing in line in 
Northridge were enraged when they were asked to board a bus that would take 
them to a center where the wait would be shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 The realization that the nightmare of camping out in cars, parks and emergency 
shelters was not over was underscored by a massive push by authorities to erect 
huge tent cities and coax the homeless into barracks-style Red Cross shelters 
before the expected weekend arrival of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand. . . . They are supposed to have emergency services," said 
mail carrier Phillip Denton, who trekked to the Crenshaw Disaster Assistance 
Center after his apartment building was condemned -- only to be told to come 
back next week. "We work hard for a living and pay taxes. We shouldn't have to 
go through this." 
</P>
<P>
 The anger was particularly acute because Clinton Administration officials, 
including Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt, had 
stressed that the aid response would be swift -- unlike the much-criticized 
handling of victims of Hurricane Andrew and other disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials had announced that for the first time, housing vouchers 
allowing low-income quake victims to quickly rent replacement apartments would 
be distributed at disaster centers. "People can take that voucher and get 
housing tomorrow," Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros 
said Wednesday, fueling the high expectations.  
</P>
<P>
 What was not made clear until victims swamped the centers late Thursday and 
Friday was the small number of people who could be processed. Only about 100 
applications were handled at some centers Friday, and future appointments were 
quickly booked through mid-February, so thousands will not receive help in 
finding new housing for nearly a month. "I've never seen a larger housing 
emergency anywhere," Cisneros said in an interview with Times editors and 
reporters. "It's stunning to see the extent of the damage. I'm guilty somewhat 
of raising expectations by talking about it," he acknowledged. "There are 
people who believe they can walk in and get a voucher and walk out and get a 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 The reality, he said, is that to safeguard public funds, officials must be 
assured that emergency aid goes only to quake victims, not the thousands of 
otherwise needy families in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 This requirement led to infuriating delays Friday morning at aid centers 
throughout Los Angeles, as those seeking help were asked to prove that their 
homes were rendered unlivable by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the severity of the problem, HUD officials moved to streamline the 
process in the afternoon, permitting some victims to begin hunting for new 
homes immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with the volume of claims, Witt also pledged to open as many as six 
additional relief centers by early next week in Calabasas, Culver City and San 
Fernando and on the Westside. Officials said 2,000 more state and federal 
workers were en route to staff the network of centers and that mass application 
sessions, allowing as many as 200 people to meet with a single worker to fill 
out forms, would begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and local officials, including Cisneros and Mayor Richard Riordan, 
huddled in a series of meetings throughout the day, trying to resolve the 
problems. The city hustled lists of damaged buildings to the FEMA centers to 
help workers confirm the eligibility of those seeking aid. But incomplete data 
and computer glitches at the city's Department of Building and Safety were 
complicating the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council hurriedly approved a loan program to provide interim rental 
funds for those awaiting FEMA assistance. The program, organized by the city's 
Housing Department, offers $500 immediately and up to $2,000 for first and last 
months' rent and security deposits. But even that money has a catch -- the 
funds cannot be released until an applicant has filled out a FEMA application. 
</P>
<P>
 While FEMA officials did distribute some emergency food stamps and issue a 
number of cash grants for housing, much of Friday's work at the centers 
appeared to be limited to pushing forms. 
</P>
<P>
 One official with the California Department of Social Services, despairing at 
the pace in the centers, observed tartly: "The only thing (the disaster 
centers) did today was create one long paper trail. All we did was take 
applications." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the confusion was uncertainty about what aid was available, and for 
whom. FEMA directly administers two types of disaster grants. Regardless of 
their income, people whose homes are unsafe can obtain a flat sum of emergency 
money, based on family size and average rents in the area, to help pay for a 
place to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA also will pay the mortgages or rents of people who are in danger of 
losing their homes because their jobs were wiped out by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "People out there are scared we're going to run out of money . . . that if 
they're not out there first, they won't get help," Witt said. "That's not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 But Linda Hooker, who has spent five days in a tent in Granada Hills with her 
two children, is losing patience. As she stood in a long line of people at the 
Van Nuys disaster center, she refused to accept the obvious -- she would not be 
getting help finding a new home anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know what they are offering. . . . From what I'm hearing, they 
are just giving out appointments. I don't know if I can wait."

LORENA BOBBITT ACQUITTED IN MUTILATION OF HUSBAND; MAIMING: JURY AGREES ABUSE 
TRIGGERED INSANITY THAT LED TO ATTACK. SHE IS SENT TO A MENTAL HOSPITAL FOR 45 
DAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Lorena Bobbitt, whose marital travails have horrified and fascinated the 
nation, was acquitted Friday by a jury that ruled she was temporarily insane 
when she cut off her husband's penis. 
</P>
<P>
 When a court official read the verdict -- not guilty by reason of insanity -- 
a shriek of disbelief rose from the crowded courtroom. But Mrs. Bobbitt showed 
no emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Kemler, one of Mrs. Bobbitt's lawyers, said later that the 
Ecuadorean-born manicurist had either not heard or not understood the verdict 
when it was read. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'Is that good?' and we told her, 'Yes, it was good,' " a beaming 
Kemler said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the verdict did not mean that Mrs. Bobbitt could go free. Denying her 
attorneys' request that she be released on bond, Judge Herman A. Whisenant Jr. 
ordered Mrs. Bobbitt to undergo 45 days of psychiatric examinations, as 
required by Virginia law in an insanity verdict. She was to be taken to Central 
State Hospital in Petersburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, about 50 supporters who had kept a vigil in the snow 
during the trial cheered when the verdict was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so afraid for her in the beginning. But this is a great demonstration 
of the legal system here in America. We are just overjoyed," said Eduardo 
Amaguana, an Ecuadorean who lives in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Janna Bisutti, a close friend of Mrs. Bobbitt's, read a statement from her to 
abused women: "She encourages you to reach out, talk to someone today." 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict, reached by seven women and five men after only seven hours of 
deliberation, ends an eight-day trial that even Mrs. Bobbitt's attorney 
described as one of the most bizarre legal episodes in U.S. judicial history. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mrs. Bobbitt admitted that she had used a long kitchen knife to cut 
off her husband's penis in the early morning hours of June 23, she and her 
attorneys contended that she did so in a moment of insanity resulting from 
years of abuse by her husband, John Wayne Bobbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 The abusive behavior reached a crescendo, the defense said, when a drunken 
John Bobbitt came home the night of June 22 and forced his wife to have sex 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt's penis has since been surgically reattached. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old bar bouncer was not in the courtroom when the verdict was 
read. His criminal lawyer, Gregory Murphy, said that John Bobbitt watched the 
verdict on television with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like someone to explain to his family how someone can do this and get 
away with it," Murphy said. "Why do they have to endure the last two weeks that 
left John out there defenseless and the prosecution taking the position that 
she was raped after he had been acquitted of that?" 
</P>
<P>
 John Bobbitt was found not guilty of marital assault in the same courtroom two 
months ago. But new evidence introduced at Lorena Bobbitt's trial led the 
prosecution to concede that her husband had physically and emotionally abused 
her many times over the course of their four-year marriage. They're now seeking 
a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 As the painfully embarrassing and sometimes shocking details of the Bobbitts' 
lives were laid bare before millions of television viewers in the United States 
and abroad, it often seemed that it was John Bobbitt who once again was on 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for anyone who watched that trial to believe that Lorena Bobbitt 
was not a woman who was pushed over the edge by years of abuse," said Kim 
Gandy, executive vice president of the National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are glad that the jury rejected the twisted argument that a battered woman 
should be locked in a prison cell while her longtime abuser gets rich on 
pay-TV," Gandy added. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bobbitt has made a number of television appearances. And shock-jock 
Howard Stern held a fund-raiser for him during a cable TV special. 
</P>
<P>
 Had she been convicted of the charge of malicious wounding, Mrs. Bobbitt faced 
a sentence of up to 20 years' imprisonment and deportation to Venezuela, where 
she was raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair Howard, the Virginia attorney who headed Mrs. Bobbitt's defense team, 
said that his client would now begin the difficult task of trying to put the 
episode behind her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wants to heal now. . . . She wants to do whatever her doctors tell her to 
do so that she can heal and get on with her life," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, if she needs help, she will get it," said Paul Ebert, the lead 
prosecutor in the case. He had argued that Mrs. Bobbitt was a vengeful woman 
who may well have been abused but nevertheless had no justification for what 
she did. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebert said that he "felt a certain amount of sympathy" for Mrs. Bobbitt. But 
he added that he was "concerned about the message" that her acquittal would 
send to other parties in domestic disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this is not going to send a message that there is no deterrent. . . . 
When you violate the law, you have to be punished," Ebert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard rejected the notion that "there is any kind of message here," saying 
that Mrs. Bobbitt was acquitted because the jury realized that she had been 
driven over the edge by years of rape, forced sodomy and other physical and 
emotional abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bobbitt, he added, proved "not to be a credible witness," despite his 
earlier acquittal and continuing denials of spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorena Bobbitt testified at the trial that she could not recall cutting off 
her husband's penis, but she did remember going to the kitchen of their 
Manassas-area apartment and picking up the knife used in the mutilation. 
</P>
<P>
 Two psychiatrists and two psychologists called by both sides in the case 
disagreed about whether Mrs. Bobbitt was temporarily insane. But all agreed 
that she was suffering from several mental disorders at the time of the 
offense. They also said they had no doubt that John Bobbitt had abused his 
wife.

UNIQUE GEOLOGY KEY TO QUAKE'S UNEVEN IMPACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The titanic energy of the magnitude 6.6 Northridge quake was reflected like 
sunlight through a prism of hidden rocks and soft sediments to violently shake 
some areas far from its epicenter in the San Fernando Valley, while leaving 
closer neighborhoods unscathed, scientists said.  
</P>
<P>
 In its path, the largest earthquake in the basin's modern history left behind 
a puzzling seismic patchwork of shattered communities, often separated by areas 
where the sharp shudders Monday did no more than disturb sleep and fray nerves. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Geophysicists now believe that shock waves within the San Fernando Valley 
crisscrossed like ripples in the caldron created by the high, hard rock of the 
surrounding mountains. Where the crests of the waves intersected, the power of 
the ground shocks was intensified. Where the troughs of the waves met crests, 
their energy was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 As the shock waves spread, the Los Angeles Basin also served as a lens to 
capture and focus the quake's force, extending the duration of the shocks.  
</P>
<P>
 The combination was enough to make one side of Pasadena shake three times 
harder than another, strong enough at the interchange of the Santa Monica and 
San Diego freeways to hurl cars in the air, according to sensors maintained by 
the state Division of Mines and Geology. 
</P>
<P>
 The direction along which the fault ruptured also may have helped aim Monday's 
tremors more directly toward the Westside of Los Angeles and Santa Monica, 
geologists said. There, dozens of buildings were severely damaged and a section 
of the Santa Monica Freeway was smashed, even though they were more than 15 
miles from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was something happening in the West L.A. area which was causing an 
amplification of the ground motion higher than the adjacent areas," said 
Wilfred D. Iwan, the Caltech earthquake specialist who is chairman of the 
California Seismic Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fairly wide variation in the intensity of the ground shaking even 
within a small area several miles around the epicenter in the Valley," he said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists still are trying to determine precisely which thrust fault slipped. 
They do not know which way the rupture progressed either, from east to west, or 
from top to bottom -- all of which could affect the direction and intensity of 
the temblor's force.  
</P>
<P>
 Experts caution that there is no hard formula to calculate the immediate 
intensity of the ground shaking caused by a single earthquake. Each stamps the 
landscape with a unique imprint. Although a nuclear explosion radiates its 
deadly energy equally in all directions, an earthquake's power can be 
dissipated safely or channeled into even fiercer intensity, depending on 
factors ranging from geophysics to the makeup of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fault plane is not complicated. What we do know, however, is that . . . 
thrust earthquakes radiate their energy in some unexpected ways," said Jim 
Mori, head of the Pasadena field office of the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists were caught off guard by the raw force of the ground motion 
generated by the Northridge quake, which yielded some of the highest 
ground-acceleration readings ever recorded in the area -- motion strong enough 
to lift a building off its foundations and drop it like a handkerchief.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is like two pieces of bad news: Not only was it a large earthquake, it was 
an unusually strong one," said USGS geophysicist John Boatwright in Menlo Park. 
 
</P>
<P>
 At some locations in the San Fernando Valley and on the Westside, the shaking 
intensities were even higher than those produced by the magnitude 7.6 Landers 
earthquake of 1992, sensors showed.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was very surprised that the ground motion was so big to the south of the 
epicenter and to the west," said Hiroo Kanamori, director of the Caltech 
Seismological Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake's magnitude is not a very good predictor of the actual ground 
motion we will feel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the desperate seconds of a major earthquake, the power of ground motion -- 
the shudders that throw people to the floor and even topple buildings -- is 
above all a matter of frequency, a low pitch to which people and the structures 
they inhabit naturally vibrate, like bells spontaneously responding to a tuning 
fork. 
</P>
<P>
 If the waves are short and fast -- of high frequency -- the earthquake's 
energy may radiate harmlessly through buildings and other structures. But if 
the shock wave slows sufficiently -- down to 10 hertz or less -- its frequency 
dips into the ranges to which houses and high-rises will respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you really are feeling when you feel your house shake is the frequency 
of the building," one seismologist said. "Other frequencies go through the 
building and don't affect it." 
</P>
<P>
 And when it comes to frequency, local soil conditions can mean the difference 
between safety on one side of the street and calamity across the way. That is 
what geologists call the "site effect." 
</P>
<P>
 "The implication is that there may be something about a local site that 
amplifies ground shaking, independent of the source of the seismic shaking or 
how far away it is," Iwan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley, sensors at a firehouse on Nordhoff Avenue recorded the ground 
accelerating during the earthquake at about one-third the force of gravity, 
while farther away from the epicenter at Sylmar Hospital, three miles east of 
the interchange of the Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways, sensors 
measured horizontal ground motion almost three times stronger.  
</P>
<P>
 The measurements taken in Tarzana, closest to the epicenter, showed even 
larger ground acceleration, almost twice the force of gravity -- "enough to 
knock your socks off," Iwan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything in excess of one G would mean that something would actually hop off 
the ground," Iwan said.  
</P>
<P>
 Iwan and other earthquake experts believe that part of the variation is in the 
difference between a house that sits on rock and one on fill dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Motion is amplified by soil," said Boatwright of the Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 As the shock waves move from hard, dense rock, such as granite, to more 
loosely compacted sedimentary rocks, the waves slow down. As they move from 
those rocks into gravel or dirt, they slow even more and their amplitude -- the 
size of the waves -- increases.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you have sedimentary basins . . . the energy gets trapped and bounces 
around for a longer period of time. The San Fernando Valley is a very good 
example of a place where the seismic energy becomes trapped," Boatwright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loosely compacted alluvial soil in the San Fernando Valley greatly enhanced 
the damage in the 1971 Sylmar quake, contributing to the collapse of the San 
Fernando veteran's hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Shock waves from the quake's epicenter traveled through the hard rock of the 
San Gabriel Mountains at 35,000 feet per second. But when the waves hit the 
looser soil in the north Valley, they slowed to 12,000 feet per second and 
concentrated the energy, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Where land is composed of loose fill, underlaid by a high water table -- as in 
the Marina del Rey, Oxnard and Long Beach areas and San Francisco's Marina 
District -- shock waves can instantly transform solid land into quicksand.  
</P>
<P>
 The Marina District was devastated in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, even 
though it was 70 miles or more from the epicenter, when its solid foundations 
became fluid. In the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, such soil liquefaction 
ruptured water lines, allowing fires to sweep through the city unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no evidence has been found that soil liquefaction caused the damage on 
the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 But even compacted sediments or sandy soil, such as that underlying some of 
the Westside and much of the Valley, can slow an earthquake's shock waves to 
the frequency that will shake a building apart, earthquake experts said.  
</P>
<P>
 State seismic hazard maps indicate that the land under the collapsed Santa 
Monica Freeway interchange at La Cienega is former swampland and fill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure the site effect was very important in the case of the highway," 
Kanamori said. 
</P>
<P>
 As scientists better understand the way an earthquake's energy is distributed 
block by block, the knowledge could have far-ranging implications for zoning, 
building codes and real estate values, earthquake experts said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The scientific understanding is so imperfect now that we are not able to 
differentiate one block from the next," Iwan said. If they tried, he added, "we 
would create either a false sense of security or a false sense of panic."

 Earthquakes are typically measured by magnitude, which may not be the best 
indicator of how powerful local shaking may be. The violence of earth movement 
is determined by many factors, including soil type, local terrain and surface 
irregularities in the fault itself. These variables help explain why in 
Monday's 6.6 quake, homes a few miles from the epicenter lost only their 
chimneys while massive sections of a freeway collapsed 20 miles away. ON SHAKY 
GROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Shaded area shows how much of the metropolitan area could be subject to 
failure because of soil conditions, including liquefaction. Ground motion in 
such areas is magnified, so damage could be substantial even in a moderate 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Measuring stations around Southern California recorded the intensity of ground 
motion at key sites during the 4:31 a.m. quake. The sensors measure the force 
of the motion by recording the acceleration caused by the quake. The motion is 
measured in terms of the force of gravity. One 'g' is strong enough to make 
unsecured buildings or vehicles literally hop off the ground.

</P>
<P>
 Liquefaction occurs in areas of loosely packed, fine-grained soil that is 
saturated by ground water. The particles of soil move freely, lubricated by the 
water, and with repeated shock waves take on the characteristics of gelatin or 
liquid. Where ground water may not be a factor, the uncompacted soil tends to 
amplify shock waves and intensify local shaking. Shock Waves 
</P>
<P>
 Trapped Energy: In a sedimentary basin like the San Fernando Valley, shock 
waves radiating from an earthquake's epicenter can be trapped by harder 
surrounding rock and reflected back on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Amplification: Where the crests of the shock waves intersect, the power of the 
earthquake is effectively amplified; where the crests intersect a trough, the 
power is canceled.

QUAKE GIVES DEAD BOY'S WRITINGS A CRUEL IRONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Just weeks before his death, Howard Lee wrote his own epitaph. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for fate, I might be somewhere else," the 14-year-old boy wrote 
in a nine-page autobiography titled "My Life." 
</P>
<P>
 That sentence proved as cruelly ironic as anything connected with the 
merciless Northridge quake, which murdered Howard in his bed, a Golf Digest he 
had been reading the night before close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers who arrived at the Northridge Meadows Apartments after the quake 
could still hear Howard, a tall, always smiling boy who was thinking seriously 
of becoming a priest, calling out from the ruins of Apartment 101. Around him 
in the darkness, 15 other people were dying, including his father, Pil, who was 
trapped in the bathroom where he had been brushing his teeth before heading off 
to work as an RTD mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Help me, help me," Howard shouted. Or maybe it was Pil. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescuers kept telling the voices to hold on. But the building had shifted 
10 feet to the north when it collapsed and they couldn't locate them, even with 
the help of Howard's mother, who had been pulled from the wreckage earlier. 
Finally, they found a pillow and showed it to Hyun Lee, who said, yes, that 
belonged to Howard, whom she affectionately called her "big son." 
</P>
<P>
 Then they found Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This son is dead, ma'am," said the firefighter. "He is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyun Lee, a deeply religious woman with a cascade of rich black hair, burst 
into tears, letting go of the thin thread of hope she'd held onto for four 
hours. "Can I see him?" she asked. Her husband's body was the last recovered 
from the ruins of the single worst catastrophe connected with the killer quake. 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for fate. The phrase sounds faintly glib and mocking now, 
cheapening everything that Pil Soon Lee was about. But there is no denying that 
the Lee family was star-crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pil Lee, known as James to his friends, was not a soft man. He had known 
hardship and been hurt by it, and he was a disciplinarian, the kind of man with 
a tendency to lecture his sons to get the best out of them. "Whenever he gave 
us speeches they were the best I ever heard," said Jason, 12, Howard's younger 
brother. Like his mother, he managed to escape the apartment and is now staying 
at the Chatsworth home of a fellow member of the Korean Catholic Center church. 
Jason's feet, crushed in the collapse of the apartment building, are wrapped 
thickly with gauze and he has to crawl around the tile floor on his hands and 
knees because the family hasn't been able to locate a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard's autobiography, written for his ninth-grade reading class at Our Lady 
Queen of Angels Seminary, next to the San Fernando Mission, provides some of 
the best insight into this unlucky but determined and, to the end, extremely 
close family. 
</P>
<P>
 Pil Lee, it is clear, was always a hard worker. He won a college scholarship 
in Korea, then became a metallurgical engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyun, a quiet girl who went to church every morning to celebrate the 
Eucharist, grew up in Inchon, helping to earn money for the family by mowing 
lawns and plowing fields. Then she became a nurse, a career she would pursue in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard took care of his parents' romance in a couple of sentences. "My dad met 
my mom at a cafe," he wrote. "They went on a couple of dates and found that 
they were meant for each other and got married." 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing from other Korean emigres that the United States was a great 
place, Pil Lee decided to chuck everything and move his new wife across the 
sea. Though he was a skilled engineer, his first job in America was driving an 
ice cream truck. But Pil was a resolute man, and he changed jobs frequently, 
always moving up the ladder, even if only inch by inch. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard was born in 1979. "I was a rowdy child," he said, though it's hard to 
reconcile his self-portrait with the word picture of him painted by teachers 
and friends. They described him as a happy, friendly kid who could charm anyone 
with his wide smile. In fact, said Father Dick Martini of Our Lady Queen of 
Angels, he won a contest at the high school this year for coaxing the most 
magazine subscriptions out of his neighbors, and was proclaimed rector for a 
day. He loved basketball and playing golf with his father, but perhaps his 
greatest gift was his empathy for others. 
</P>
<P>
 The day Sister St. George lectured her students for coming to school 
unprepared, Howard was the only student to approach her after class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry we weren't prepared today," he said. "We'll do better next time." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason was born two years after Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Pil Lee's tireless work paid off and he had his own clothing 
store, selling Levis. Business was good. But then the store was robbed and the 
Lees, worried about the safety of their sons, sold the business. 
</P>
<P>
 With the money they had saved, the family purchased a big house with a 
swimming pool in the Valley. "Everything seemed to be going all right," wrote 
Howard. The family invested some of their savings in a Chinese restaurant in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision proved to be the first fateful wrong turn. The economy in 
Southern California hit the skids and the business began losing $5,000 a month. 
Friends loaned them money, but that only put off the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never seen my parents so tired in my entire life," Howard wrote. "My 
mom even told me that it was so hard to try to keep the restaurant alive that 
she thought of ending her life. I tried to help the best I could but it seemed 
all that I did just got in other people's way. I was worried about my family 
because it seemed to me that we were breaking up." 
</P>
<P>
 Then they found grace. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my mom got home one night she started praying. My dad, my brother and I 
joined her. Pretty soon after that we started having a family prayer every 
night before we went to sleep. I truly think that the night prayers together 
with my family saved us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lees lost the restaurant, then their home. In 1993, they were forced to 
move into a small two-bedroom apartment in Northridge. Pil Lee, who had a job 
as a mechanic for the RTD, started thinking about getting an engineering degree 
in the United States. The family was no longer well off, but never again would 
they lose heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thank God that my family survived the whole ordeal," Howard wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that some other families would have been separated or even hurt. All 
my family left with were a few emotional scars." 
</P>
<P>
 The next fateful turn occurred last year when the family got lost and ended up 
in the driveway of Queen of Angels, a high school seminary, which is a kind of 
boarding school for young men thinking of going on to the priesthood. Howard 
had just graduated from grammar school and was unsure where he would go next. 
After some thought, he decided to enroll at Queen of Angels, though he was 
worried about leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally stopped thinking of the problems I might have at the seminary, but 
the advantages. That's why you find me attending your classes Mrs. Main. If it 
weren't for fate, I might be somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 And if it weren't for fate, Howard Lee would not have been in his bed in the 
apartment Sunday night. Students normally live at the seminary from Sunday 
through Friday night. But because Monday was a holiday, the students had one 
extra day at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyun Lee said she wants to resume her old life as soon as she can, and as soon 
as her youngest son recovers from his injuries. A funeral mass for Pil and 
Howard Lee is scheduled today at St. Charles Church in North Hollywood, at 
which Cardinal Roger M. Mahony is scheduled to officiate, according to family 
and church officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyun Lee pondered over the reason why God would call her husband and son to 
him, because she has no doubt that he did. 
</P>
<P>
 God "really loves them," explained Jason, translating his mother's uncertain 
English. "And he wanted to stop their suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people wouldn't be satisfied with that explanation. But then many people, 
as Howard pointed out, would have had their spirits crushed by other setbacks 
the family suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Martini said that after the accident, Hyun Lee went to church and knelt 
at the altar. A priest saw her and approached hesitantly, unsure of himself and 
of what to say to this aggrieved woman. Suddenly, she saw him and, as though 
eager to relieve his momentary suffering, extended herself to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, father, come and pray with me," she said.

FAA CLEARS O.C. CONTROLLERS IN IN-N-OUT CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tape recordings of the final words between the pilot of an ill-fated private 
jet and air traffic controllers just before the aircraft crashed in Santa Ana 
show that controllers did nothing improper, Federal Aviation Administration 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Controllers warned the pilot, Stephen Barkin, repeatedly that he needed to 
reduce his speed because he was gaining on a jetliner ahead of him. Although 
Barkin was not told that the jetliner was a Boeing 757 or warned that his craft 
could be caught in dangerous wake turbulence, FAA officials said the tapes show 
that he was given more information than required by federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tapes, played during an FAA briefing here, Barkin can be heard 
acknowledging three advisories from controllers to slow down as he gained on a 
United Airlines Boeing 757 landing ahead of him. He also said in his final 
words to the John Wayne Airport tower: "OK, we're slowing . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Barkin, who is heard earlier on the tapes saying that he has the United jet in 
sight, was even told he could fly a curvy path in order to increase his 
distance from the aircraft ahead of him, according to the tapes, which included 
separate conversations with a regional radar facility in El Toro and the John 
Wayne Airport tower. 
</P>
<P>
 "Westwind . . . traffic you're following is at 150 knots; you can S-turn as 
necessary to follow that traffic," an unnamed controller at Coast Terminal 
Radar Control is heard telling Barkin. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, we'll slow it up and do what we have to," Barkin replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have said that Barkin was still flying the Westwind executive 
jet too fast. But they have also said that speed may not have been the 
important factor in the Dec. 15 crash near the Santa Ana Auto Mall, that killed 
all five aboard, including the top two executives of the In-N-Out hamburger 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the crash probe has focused on the issue of the 757's wake 
turbulence, which may have caused the Westwind to roll over and plummet, out of 
control, nose first into the ground. Wake turbulence has been known to affect 
aircraft following up to seven miles behind a 757. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board, which is still 
trying to determine the cause of the accident, have said Barkin flew below the 
path of the 757, which is dangerous because the 757's powerful wake turbulence 
-- mini-tornadoes extending off the aircraft's wingtips -- drops toward the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But the NTSB has said Barkin may not have been aware of the extent of the 
danger ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB has not released transcripts of the conversations taped by the 
cockpit voice recorder, which contain remarks made inside the plane. But 
investigators said that when they played the tape they heard a question about a 
control problem and what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkin was never told he was following a Boeing 757 even though the FAA last 
year issued a warning to controllers about the potentially dangerous wake 
turbulence caused by 757s. Moreover, the agency was aware of research and 
recommendations suggesting an increase in the distance between 757s and 
aircraft following them. 
</P>
<P>
 This has prompted criticism of the FAA by pilots for being concerned with 
airline profits, which decline when separation between aircraft is increased, 
at the expense of safety. 
</P>
<P>
 On one of the two tapes released Friday, a Coast TRACON controller in El Toro 
is heard telling Barkin: "Westwind . . . following a United Boeing jet on base 
-- two o'clock -- four miles southeast -- bound 4,000 (feet) -- descending," a 
reference to both planes' positions when Barkin was still about five miles from 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the FAA maintains that controllers were not required to tell Barkin 
the specific model of Boeing aircraft he was following. And at Friday's 
briefing, the FAA insisted that the tape recordings and transcripts show that 
the transmissions were, as one agency official put it, "strictly routine." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the information given to Barkin was provided "voluntarily," said 
George Barnett, a supervisor in the FAA's air traffic division. "They were not 
required by procedure." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett said he would not speculate about changes he may feel are indicated as 
a result of the Dec. 15 crash. And he repeated the FAA's position that, under 
current regulations, it was Barkin's responsibility to maintain proper 
separation from the 757 because he was flying under visual flight rules. 
</P>
<P>
 From time to time, Barnett said, controllers give advisories to alert a pilot 
to conditions whether the rules require them to or not. For example, Barkin was 
given advisories about the 757's altitude, but simply as a voluntary assist in 
locating the aircraft in front of him, Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke said that controllers differ in style and approach 
to such communications, which sometimes depend on how busy they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Many pilots who fly into John Wayne Airport have said controllers often told 
them when they were following 757s, even though there was no specific warning 
about wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different from controller to controller, and even airport to airport," 
Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the Dec. 15 crash, the FAA has asked controllers to advise pilots 
when they are flying behind 757s and give wake turbulence warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA officials declined to speculate about what caused the Westwind to crash, 
adding that the NTSB has not yet ruled out factors other than wake turbulence, 
such as mechanical failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of the tapes coincided with the first wrongful-death lawsuit filed 
in the crash by survivors of one of the five victims, Philip R. West, an 
executive of the In-N-Out chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint, filed in Orange County Superior Court by West's widow, Lori, 
and son, Michael, seeks unspecified damages from the Westwind's owner, Robert 
Gumbiner, founder of the FHP health organization, Management Activities Inc., 
Gumbiner's aircraft leasing firm, and Martin Aviation, which chartered the 
plane from Management Activities.

COUNCIL TO FUND HOUSING LOANS WITH HUD GRANT; AFTERMATH: IN STOPGAP MEASURE, 
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH and HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With thousands of people displaced from their homes and apartments, the Los 
Angeles City Council voted unanimously Friday to spend tens of millions of 
dollars in federal housing funds to make emergency low-interest loans to 
displaced tenants and residential property owners who have suffered earthquake 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants who apply for federal help at disaster assistance centers will be 
given $500 vouchers immediately -- and up to $2,000 for first and last month's 
rent and security deposits -- which they will have to repay to the city when 
their federal assistance checks are issued. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said landlord associations have indicated that their members 
will accept the vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing rehabilitation loans, normally available only to property owners 
with low and moderate incomes, would extend for two years and be available to 
owners of houses or apartments in the city regardless of their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners would qualify as long as the total encumbrances on their property -- 
including the value of the new loan -- did not exceed the property's appraised 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest would accumulate at 5%, but no principal or interest payments would 
be due until the two-year period is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a responsibility to be rather aggressive to get funds into the hands 
of people who have been disadvantaged by earthquake damage," said City 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who introduced the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant General Manager Barbara Zeidman of the Los Angeles Housing 
Department said the city probably will fund the rehabilitation loans with at 
least $25 million to $30 million of an advance on its $109-million federal 
Housing and Urban Development grant for next year. Conceivably, she said, the 
council could authorize use of almost the entire HUD grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeidman anticipates the city spending another $2.5 million in federal money on 
emergency assistance to renters displaced by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Money would go only to renters who had applied to the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency or the Small Business Administration for assistance and were 
waiting for it to come through. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeidman said experience with past disasters shows that it takes about three 
weeks for FEMA to begin efficiently processing applications for help. When FEMA 
is fully up and running, she said, the agency should be able to offer an 
applicant a check within three to five days. 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding to provide rental assistance to displaced tenants applying for 
FEMA help, Zeidman said, "we were after a product that will fill a three-week 
gap." 
</P>
<P>
 Housing rehabilitation loans were also aimed at filling a gap, officials said. 
They will have to be paid off or refinanced after two years, said city Housing 
Department Administration Director Matthew Callahan. If a loan recipient has a 
high income and wants to extend the loan, he or she would be asked to pay the 
going interest rates. Low-income recipients might only be required to repay the 
principal of the loan upon selling the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeidman said the city will be able to complete property appraisals and fund 
the loans within 10 days, while federal agencies are expected to take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in the loans -- which are available regardless of the amount 
of damage incurred -- can find out about them at disaster assistance centers or 
by calling the Housing Department at (800) 946-4444. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the use of its federal funds after receiving pledges from 
HUD officials that they would advance next year's grant soon and eventually ask 
Congress to reimburse Los Angeles for money spent on earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The city ordinarily uses its HUD money for a variety of community-development 
projects, including job training, low-income housing construction and, last 
year, $16 million in housing rehabilitation loans to low- and moderate-income 
property owners or owners in blighted areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In another matter affecting tenants, the City Council temporarily tightened 
eviction regulations in the wake of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Evictions will not be allowed during the next 45 days because an apartment is 
overcrowded or a property owner discovers that it has been sublet without his 
or her knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Evictions would still be permitted for failure to pay rent, but Councilwoman 
Jackie Goldberg, who made the motion to forestall them, asked the Housing 
Department to request that landlords show forbearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with mountains of debris from the earthquakes, Mayor Richard Riordan and 
the City Council also gave emergency approval Friday to putting private 
garbage-collection companies on the streets today to assist city workers.  
</P>
<P>
 No sooner had the plan been announced, however, than it stirred concern among 
city labor leaders, who have worried about Riordan's attempts to privatize 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Dickerson, president of the Board of Public Works, said city officials 
are extremely sensitive to the fears of city workers. But he insisted that the 
200 or so private contractors to be brought in will not pick up residential 
refuse. That will remain the duty of city workers, he said.

REBUILDING DECISION IS COMPLEX FOR PROPERTY OWNERS; BUILDING: LOSS OF RENTS, 
PLUNGING REAL ESTATE VALUES, LACK OF BUILDING INSPECTORS BEDEVIL THE PROCESS. 
'IT'S A DOMINO EFFECT,' ONE BUSINESSMAN SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 With more than 1,100 buildings declared uninhabitable, property owners across 
Los Angeles began to make wrenching decisions Friday about whether to rebuild 
earthquake battered houses, apartments and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 A Northridge landlord said he might declare bankruptcy and demolish two 
apartment buildings, rather than try to rebuild with no insurance, problematic 
financing and slumping real estate values. In Westwood, the owner of one half 
of a commercial strip decided to rebuild and make a go of it, while the owner 
of the other half planned to apply for a demolition permit. And a South-Central 
Los Angeles apartment owner was already lining up for a building permit. 
</P>
<P>
 As owners made their assessments, an expanded force of more than 600 
inspectors continued to survey the damage. Officials said they might have to 
check as many as 25,000 buildings for safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a fifth of that number had been inspected by the end of the week, and 
city building and safety officials said they were prepared to work 12-hour 
shifts through the weekend in hopes of completing their task by the end of next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary report showed Friday that 1,175 structures are uninhabitable, 
including more than 4,800 housing units. With little more than half of the 
5,000 building assessments by city building inspectors tabulated, damage 
reached $373.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Owners are expected to take the initiative to repair their buildings once they 
have been tagged with with red "unsafe" or yellow "limited entry" placards. 
They must hire engineers or architects to submit plans to the city for all but 
the most cosmetic repairs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of Friday only a handful of owners had applied to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they have plans to expeditiously handle the applications when 
they come in. Under an ordinance to be weighed by the City Council next week, 
earthquake repair applications would be moved ahead of all others within the 
city bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There'll be a lot of vacant lots unless there's some sort of federal tax 
relief or some other loopholes to get through," said David Harper, a principal 
in two Northridge garden apartments, one condemned and the other extensively 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper said he would probably need a second mortgage to rebuild, but cannot 
afford it. And if his first mortgage is forgiven, he said he would not be able 
to survive the hefty tax bill for his capital gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's financial and tax problems in addition to the physical problems," 
Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 A mini-mall owner in Northridge feared that he also would have to shut down 
because his lender was not willing to let him defer payments while his 
mom-and-pop retail tenants are out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 A dry cleaner, barbecue stand and camera shop are all shut down and not paying 
rent after the quake, so owner William W. Matthews said he cannot afford to 
make payments either. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a domino effect," he said. "No rents means no money means no mortgage; 
it's just that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 At twin Westwood retail buildings, the question of whether to rebuild was 
answered with a split decision. The owner of one of the buildings on Westwood 
Boulevard was preparing to reopen for a picture framing store and a window 
repair shop. But his neighbor, who shared a common wall, was applying for a 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just decided that it's not worth it," said contractor Frank Erichson, 
who was arranging the tear down, as well as the reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 In South-Central, building owner Lee Linden said structural engineers were 
seeking permits Friday to rebuild his damaged apartment building on Martin 
Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The four-unit structure was deemed unsafe earlier 
this week. It has cracked walls and was moved several inches from its 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, about 20 residents were camping under a lean-to of tarps and sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Linden said workers will reinforce and rebuild damaged sections as soon as the 
city issued permits. "It's up to building and safety. Nothing can be done until 
they issue a permit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4500 S. Broadway, a five-unit apartment building had been declared unsafe. 
Across the street was a reminder of a previous disaster: a lot that once housed 
a strip mall burned during the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Building owner Norman Unis, whose furniture store sits underneath the 
apartments, said a structural engineer was already drawing up repair plans. 
Total cost would be about $25,000 and take two to three months "if we're 
lucky," Unis said.  
</P>
<P>
 Along heavily damaged Hollywood Boulevard, many property owners were still 
trying to assess the damage and decide whether it was feasible to make repairs. 
If that turns out to be impractical, they will have to decide if it is 
worthwhile to rebuild at a time of falling real estate values and many 
vacancies in office buildings and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the biggest problem -- all that has to be analyzed," said Ted Romano, 
a periodontist, who watched from the street while workmen cleaned up the fallen 
bricks from a row of his father's two-story storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know right now (what we will do)," Romano said. "We're just waiting 
for the engineering reports." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Hollywood Boulevard structure that suffered heavily was a four-story 
commercial building at Western Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 A red notice posted on a badly cracked pillar proclaimed the building 
"unsafe," but the Bargain Saver novelty store on the ground floor remained open 
for business Friday. Few ventured into the shop, which sells tapestries of 
Elvis and Marilyn Monroe, watches, socks, cologne, phones and bean-bag chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop owner Ben Chinitz, a tenant for 18 years, said inspectors told him they 
would not be enforcing the "do not inhabit" orders for at least a week. 
Meanwhile, his landlord had sent a contractor to City Hall to fight some of the 
inspectors' reports, saying that a nearly completed earthquake retrofitting has 
made the building safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I thought the building was unsafe, we would not be talking inside the 
building," Chinitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Corona del Mar in Pacific Palisades, where multimillion-dollar homes are 
imperiled by landslides, the decision on where to go may have been made for 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-dozen homes on bluffs overlooking the beach have either been declared 
unsafe or safe only for limited entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Others had made their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center on the Westside, a damaged parking 
structure was coming down Friday. The hospital chain also applied for a 
demolition permit to remove its damaged five-story medical office building in 
Granada Hills. But no decision has been made on whether to rebuild the 
facility, said spokeswoman Maria Lengerke. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the city was moving ahead to clear buildings that posed an imminent 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews were removing the remains of three homes on Buena Park Drive in Studio 
City. Building officials also had ordered the demolition of a medical office 
building on Olympic Boulevard on the Westside. And inspectors Friday said an 
employee parking structure at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center might also have to 
come down. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that if owners cannot afford to pay for demolitions, they 
will do the work free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Board of Public Works approved a program Friday, to be in place by 
late February, to demolish the most seriously damaged buildings at no cost to 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Richard Riordan said that was not soon enough. "Can't we move more 
quickly?" Riordan asked at a meeting of the city's Emergency Operations Board. 
Riordan noted the long delays in clearing much of the wreckage after the 1992 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Requests for more inspections continued to pile up Friday. Widespread Damage 
</P>
<P>
 The City of Los Angeles has declared hundreds of buildings uninhabitable 
because of earthquake damage. That number is likely to grow substantially as 
additional inspections are performed. The dots indicate unsafe buildings; 
clusters may understate the actual number where there are multiple structures 
in one block. The area is divided into City Council districts.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE FACTS; DAMAGE REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some facts and figures on Monday's magnitude 6.6 earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 * DEATHS: 55 
</P>
<P>
 * AFTERSHOCKS: A swarm of sharp aftershocks ranging from 4.2 to 4.4 centered 
three miles northwest of San Fernando rattled Southern California on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * DAMAGE: Of more than 2,800 sites inspected, 447 structures -- including 295 
residential buildings with almost 4,500 dwelling units -- were declared 
uninhabitable, totaling an estimated $376.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * INJURIES: More than 6,547 people were treated and released at hospitals; 
about 1,292 were admitted for care, and 216 remain in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 * CURFEW: The 11 p.m.-to-dawn curfew for Los Angeles was canceled on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARRESTS: The Los Angeles Police Department has taken 221 people into custody 
in a four-day period. Most were general arrests and not for curfew violations 
or looting. On a typical day, there would be about 550 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOMELESS: Since the quake, the Salvation Army reportedly has fed about 
18,700 people and supplied about 15,000 gallons of water to victims. The Red 
Cross has served about 35,000 meals.  
</P>
<P>
 * NATIONAL GUARD: A total of 2,579 National Guard troops have been mobilized. 
The National Guard has committed more than 1,000 soldiers -- in day and night 
shifts of 500 -- to conducting security patrols at shopping malls and selected 
sites in quake-damaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * UTILITIES: The Southern California Gas Co. will have more than 3,400 service 
personnel working in the heavily impacted earthquake areas this weekend to turn 
on gas service. The company has found that there may be twice as many customers 
in earthquake areas without service. DWP crews concentrated on blackouts in 
scattered homes and blocks. As of this morning, about 700 customers still 
didn't have electricity as a result of broken connections and transformers.  
</P>
<P>
 * TRANSIT: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority set up a line dubbed the 
Westside Special to help commuters cope with the shutdown of the Santa Monica 
Freeway (I-10). Buses on Line 634 leave every 20 minutes during weekday morning 
and evening rush hours, or as demand warrants. The one-way fare is $1.50. 
Earthquake damage forced Caltrans officials to close three connector roads at 
the Ventura (134) and Glendale (2) freeways junction on Friday, but officials 
said repairs should be completed by Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 * SCHOOLS: More than 200 school buildings have been seriously damaged or 
destroyed. All Los Angeles school district campuses will remain closed through 
Friday. Some San Fernando Valley schools could remain closed for several weeks.

SCHOOLS TRY TO CALM YOUTHS: 'WE NEED HELP GETTING THEM BACK ON TRACK'

<P>
 Six-year-old Ricky Carmona wakes up screaming for his mother and crying during 
the cold nights he has spent outdoors since Monday's devastating earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen-year-old Isabel Villa spent her first night indoors Thursday -- in 
her high school gymnasium-turned-shelter -- because her baby brother was too 
sick to sleep in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 And 10-year-old Enrique Munoz, who was busy fanning the flames of a campfire 
at a recreation center across from his school, said he was too scared to return 
to the campus because "the school could fall down on me." 
</P>
<P>
 These students are among the thousands who will be returning to Los Angeles 
Unified School District campuses soon, their lives turned upside down by 
Monday's magnitude 6.6 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of their return, school officials are scrambling to deal with 
the influx, seeking assistance to deal with the emotional and physical toll on 
their students. For some youngsters, school may be the first place since 
Monday's temblor where they will receive hot food, medical care and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably more important than the schools will be the souls of these students. 
We need to do everything we can to help them," said Deputy Supt. Ruben 
Zacarias. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Sid Thompson said the district will need help from private and public 
organizations to provide for the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're traumatized," Thompson said. "We need help getting them back on track 
. . . and getting them help for what they've just gone through." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials are working with the county health department to coordinate 
services for students who might need medical help, and psychological crisis 
teams plan to fan out across the district next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31st District Parent Teacher Assn., which covers the San Fernando Valley, 
is planning to aid schools with donations of supplies and other needed items. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about an incredible toll in terms of physical loss and 
psychological trauma," said Harriet Sculley, the district PTA president. "Who 
knows how long these kids' lives are going to be disrupted?" 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say they are preparing to deal with the medical problems 
students will bring to schools. They are concerned about the health of students 
who are living in tents and shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school nurses are going to be on the front lines with this," said Dr. 
Helen Hale, who oversees the district's medical services. "As people continue 
living in those tents, we're going to have big health problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosie Carmona, whose son, Ricky, is having nightmares, said she will not send 
her children to school until she has an apartment and she feels it is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if school opens tomorrow, I won't send them," she said, brushing her 
daughter's hair after her first shower since Sunday. "It might be more trauma 
for them. We're frightened. We don't want to go back inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Park High School student Isabel Villa, who spent the night in a shelter 
instead of the park because her brother was having trouble breathing, said she 
is tired, her back hurts and she is worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared for my family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students, who have not lost their homes, say they, too, are worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Feller, a junior at North Hollywood High, said his "life has been put on 
hold." Feller was scheduled to take the Scholastic Aptitude Test today, but it 
was postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," Feller said. "I was psyching myself up for it. It's hard 
to tell what is going to happen. I'm anxious." 
</P>
<P>
 For Enrique Munoz, who is living in a makeshift tent next to his father's 
truck at the Winnetka Recreation Center, the earthquake has left him fearful 
and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no place to go," he said. "We'll stay here. It's better outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Even students whose homes were not lost are suffering.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid when I'm in school and my mom's home and it could shake again and 
I won't be with her," Lilian Villa, 10, who attends Napa Street Elementary in 
Northridge, said as she sipped soup at the Canoga Park High School shelter. 
"I'm scared to go back." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials predict the effects of the earthquake and the aftershocks 
will stay with many students indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to gear ourselves up for the long haul," said Sandy Landar, a 
Canoga Park High School assistant principal in charge of counseling. "I think 
we have to take it day by day with these kids and be as responsive as we can."

A NEW LESSON PLAN; PRIVATE SCHOOLS SCRAMBLE TO FIND ALTERNATIVE CLASSROOMS AND 
WONDER HOW THEY'LL BE ABLE TO AFFORD REPAIR WORK

 Alemany High School, a Roman Catholic institution in Mission Hills, is moving 
-- and not just bouncing with aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 With its Rinaldi Street campus shattered by this week's earthquake, the school 
is shifting operations to a nearby Roman Catholic seminary that will 
accommodate the 1,610 students on double shifts starting Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany administrators were scrambling Friday to rent portable classrooms and 
haul salvageable equipment to the Queen of Angels Junior Seminary a block away. 
Looming beyond those chores are more daunting questions of how to rebuild the 
Alemany campus, where nine of the 12 buildings are unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so heartbreaking. It looks like a war zone," said Theresa Litzie, 
secretary to Alemany's principal. Exterior walls of its English classroom 
building are split precariously from the roof, by a foot in some places. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany's woe is one of the most dramatic examples of the temblors' effect on 
private and religious schools in Southern California. Most such schools 
appeared to have escaped major damage and expect to have students back Monday, 
or no later than Jan. 31. Still, even moderate losses may mean an uneasy future 
if the schools have no earthquake insurance and no major endowments, experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they've done their homework, they've set aside reserves for that kind of 
contingency. If not, they're in real trouble. They may have to borrow money or 
have to raise money," said the Rev. Charles Rowins, past president of the 
California Assn. of Private School Organizations. He is headmaster of St. James 
Episcopal School in the Mid-Wilshire area, where damage was light. 
</P>
<P>
 The coeducational Alemany High School has earthquake insurance through the 
sprawling Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which can soften the blows 
through its charitable activities in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the archdiocese's 53 high schools and 232 elementary schools, only Alemany 
and four elementary schools -- St. Euphrasia in Granada Hills, Mary Immaculate 
in Pacoima, Nativity in South-Central Los Angeles and St. Anne's in Santa 
Monica -- were damaged so badly that officials are unsure when they will 
reopen. Most others will be open Monday or after safety inspections later in 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Porath, the Roman Catholic archdiocese's superintendent of schools, 
said students would be sent from damaged schools to other campuses only as a 
last resort. "Our preference is to keep the student body and the program intact 
at each school, on the property if we can," he said. Temporary arrangements 
were being studied Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Private schools, non-sectarian and religious, are eligible for federal 
emergency assistance, according to a government spokesman. But school 
administrators said they are not counting on such aid to cover much of their 
repair expenses. So, voluntary fund raising and cleanups have begun. 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Angeles Baptist High School in North Hills, a letter will soon be 
mailed to alumni and other supporters requesting donations to offset the 
estimated $100,000 in earthquake damage, mainly at its gymnasium. "The fact is 
I've already gotten calls from all over the nation offering help," Principal 
Gary Smidderks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes are set to resume Monday at the Baptist high school for its 780 boys 
and girls. However, with the gym off limits, basketball games will be moved to 
other schools and scheduled assemblies postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bureau of Jewish Education of Greater Los Angeles, which serves 30 
Orthodox-, Conservative- and Reform-affiliated schools, reported that all will 
be reopened by Jan. 31. Some were to be on winter vacation next week anyway, 
executive director Gil Graff said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Emek Hebrew Day School in North Hollywood, administrators said students' 
parents will ease the estimated $50,000 in quake repairs with their own labor 
as well as with cash. "We really have no other choice," said Rabbi Philip 
Wachsman, the principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's quake tumbled a rear cinder-block wall, cracked plumbing and tilted 
doorways at Emek Hebrew, which has about 300 pupils from pre-kindergarten 
through fifth grade. Wachsman said he hoped most repairs will be done in a 
week. "When you are working with small children, you want to be sure it's 
safe," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 That volunteer spirit was evident at many other schools as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors by Friday had replaced thousands of fallen ceiling tiles at the 
Harvard-Westlake School's Studio City campus. Volunteer faculty, parents and 
students cleaned up much of the remaining mess and re-shelved 20,000 library 
books. Part of a shattered wall at the interdenominational chapel awaits 
repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake does not have earthquake insurance but has enough reserve 
funds to cover the more than $250,000 in reconstruction, according to 
Headmaster Thomas C. Hudnut. He said the school would not apply for federal 
emergency aid because "we have our own resources and see no need to take 
government funds from anyone else." The school, which enrolls 1,500 middle 
school and high school students, has a campus in Bel-Air that was undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Los Angeles area, some families of students in private or religious 
schools have lost jobs or homes and fear that they will no longer be able to 
afford tuition. The schools say they will attempt to grant financial aid for 
those emergencies. In many cases, arrangements are still being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, campuses in the San Fernando Valley report transportation 
obstacles. The Village Christian Schools, a kindergarten through high school 
campus in Sun Valley, has students and faculty from the over the hills in the 
Santa Clarita Valley, now cut off from its bus service. The campus is 
encouraging teachers and students to ride the Metrolink trains to the Burbank 
station, from which the school will operate a shuttle bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents of elementary students may ride the train with their children, 
but others cannot do so and will not send the youngsters alone, according to 
David Wilson, the school's director of development. "We may lose some students. 
That's an unfortunate possibility," he said.

 What Happened: 
</P>
<P>
 1. The shaking and buckling caused havoc with the steel and concrete pipes and 
the aqueducts operated by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The Los Angeles Aqueduct, which brings water from the Owens Valley, broke 
just south of Soledad Canyon. The flow of water was quickly transferred to a 
second aqueduct, but engineers soon found that it too was leaking badly and 
shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
 3. A 10-foot section of the Metropolitan Water District's major importation 
pipeline was severed at the Joseph Jensen Water Filtration Plant in Granada 
Hills. That precluded the MWD from bringing water from Northern California 
until early Thursday morning, when repairs were completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP repaired damage to its second aqueduct early Thursday, but when water 
began to pour through, additional leaks were discovered and officials were 
forced to shut it down again. Repairs on both aqueducts could take up to a week 
to complete. The aqueducts are only part of the DWP's problems. Of the five 
major trunk lines that serve the northwest San Fernando Valley area, only three 
are operating. Upward of 4,000 additional breaks in local mains have been 
reported and officials fear that as water service is restored, still more leaks 
in the system will be discovered. As of Friday, about 20,000 customers in some 
areas of the Valley, including Granada Hills and higher elevations of the Santa 
Monica Mountains and West Hills, were still without water. Limited Service 
</P>
<P>
 Temblors can break underground sewage pipes as well as potable water mains. If 
water pressure drops -- from high demands fighting fires or because of 
restricted incoming supplies -- sewage can seep into the water lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Areas facing possible contamination include: 
</P>
<P>
 Limited: The northwest San Fernando Valley north of Devonshire Street and west 
of DeSoto Avenue, where service is slowly being restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Intermittent: Residents between DeSoto and Balboa Boulevard and north of the 
Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) between the Golden State Freeway (Interstate 
5) and Hubbard Avenue where there is currently intermittent service. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspect: Customers in the area west of Fairfax Avenue and south of Sunset 
Boulevard had been under the boil-water advisory until it was lifted Friday 
morning after tests showed there was no contamination. The order remained in 
effect for residents of the San Fernando Valley and the Santa Monica Mountains 
north of Sunset Boulevard -- including the communities of Bel Air, Beverly 
Glen, Mount Olympus, Hollywood Hills and Pacific Palisades. What Is Being Done 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 DWP workers are in the San Fernando Valley fixing breaks in the 
water system. DWP crews are being supplemented by crews from Orange County, 
Long Beach, San Diego, Las Vegas and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Work is continuing on the aqueducts, trunk lines, mains and at a series of 
damaged water tanks that serve higher elevations in the west Valley area. The 
Los Angeles Fire Department is assisting the DWP in pumping water to higher 
elevations in the North West Valley above Devonshire. 
</P>
<P>
 Some MWD water is being routed through the DWP's pipeline network, and water 
from the State Water Project is now being filtered and processed by a repaired 
DWP plant in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP is utilizing the seven- to 10-day supply of water it has stored in 
area reservoirs, and officials have begun pumping ground water from the San 
Fernando Valley aquifer to supplement the supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 20,000 residents currently without water should have service 
restored within a week. How to Treat Contaminated Water 
</P>
<P>
 If you suspect your water is polluted, strain through paper towels or like 
material and boil vigorously for five minutes. This will usually make it safe 
from harmful bacterial contamination. Or you may purify the water by adding the 
chemicals shown in this table. 
</P>
<P>
 Amount of water: 1 quart 
</P>
<P>
 Amount of chlorine bleach to add to clear water: 2 drops 
</P>
<P>
 Amount of chlorine bleach to add to cloudy water: 4 drops 
</P>
<P>
 Amount of tincture of Iodine 2% to add to clear water: 3 drops 
</P>
<P>

 Because of the close proximity of sewage and water lines under streets, there 
can be a cross-contamination after breaks caused by earthquakes. Officials are 
uncertain how much, if any, contamination has occurred until they can survey 
breaks throughout the system.

NEW FINDINGS MOVE RUPTURE ZONE NORTH OF FIRST LOCATION; SURVEY: MORE THAN 1,500 
AFTERSHOCKS HAVE BEEN RECORDED SINCE MONDAY'S TEMBLOR.

 Scientists on Friday reported finding extensive new surface cracking and 
likely rupture zones from the Northridge quake along the Santa Susana Mountains 
and in Potrero Canyon, five miles west of Castaic Junction near the Ventura 
County line. 
</P>
<P>
 A team from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and UC Berkeley said they had 
found cracks as wide as a foot and hundreds of feet in length at the top of the 
Santa Susanas in an area extending about 10 miles west from the Newhall Pass, 
near the ruined interchange of the Antelope Valley (California 14) and Golden 
State (Interstate 5) freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the U.S. Geological Survey reported that more than a dozen 
scientists had made an on-site inspection of a 6- to 12-inch earth displacement 
in Potrero Canyon just off California 126, several miles to the north of 
earlier reports of evidence of quake activity. Two USGS scientists at a Caltech 
news briefing called this a likely rupture zone from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The sites of cracking, land displacement and a new cluster of aftershocks in 
the magnitude 4 range are all helping researchers delineate the exact extent of 
the Northridge quake. Generally speaking, this is a northwest trending oblong 
extending perhaps 20 miles from the northeast San Fernando Valley toward 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The epicenter of the quake has been officially put at 34 degrees, 13 minutes 
north and 118 degrees, 32 minutes west, or just northwest of the intersection 
of Roscoe and Reseda boulevards, about one mile south southwest of the center 
of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Although UC Berkeley seismologists said they believe the quake reached a 
magnitude 6.8, Caltech and the USGS stuck with the original 6.6 figure. 
Magnitude estimates may change as more stations from around the world report 
their instrumental readings. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Mori, director of the USGS Pasadena field office, said that the 
aftershocks, although annoying and even scary to many residents, are not 
deviating from a normal pattern for quakes of such size as the magnitude 6.6 
last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,500 aftershocks had been recorded through Friday afternoon. He 
said that a close analysis of the aftershocks since Monday showed there have 
actually been only two quakes in the magnitude 5 range (a smaller figure than 
had been given earlier), about 30 in the 4 range and about 270 others in the 3 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech and the USGS said Friday that the aftershock zone extends 20 miles 
east-west, from San Fernando through the Santa Susana Mountains, and for about 
18 miles from Northridge in the south to the Santa Clarita Valley in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the seismological point of view, this was a very small earthquake," Mori 
said of the main shock. Worldwide in an average year, he said, there are about 
150 such quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 What made this one different was that it occurred in an urban area and the 
damage and casualties were dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Ponti and Ken Hudnut, two USGS scientists, said the discovery of a likely 
rupture zone in Potrero Canyon, north of the Santa Susanas, indicates that a 
previously undiscovered fault lies in the canyon and that there was ground 
movement along this fault. Similar signs of movement were reported Tuesday 
along the Mission Hills Fault, south of the Santa Susanas. 
</P>
<P>
 It is common in such earthquakes that movement on one fault will trigger 
movement on others, and the aftershocks reflect this, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cracks in Potrero Canyon run in rows of about 10 to 20 yards in open areas and 
at the bottom of the hills in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists who first went into the canyon Wednesday said they expect to 
examine the surface disturbance for five more days. 
</P>
<P>
 David Schwartz of the USGS, who was there Friday, said, "It's possible this is 
the tip of the fault that produced the Northridge earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 head of cattle graze in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponti said that the surface rupture in Potrero Canyon extends about four 
miles. But the team of Berkeley scientists said in a statement that the 
cracking they had noted in the Santa Susanas extended even further. 
</P>
<P>
 They also noted signs of some cracking in the hills to the northeast of 
Antelope Valley-Golden State freeway interchange and postulated that the same 
forces that caused the cracks had caused the interchange to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Williams, a geologist with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, said the 
cracks made it appear that the Santa Susana range was being pulled apart, which 
would be consistent with the notion that the quake squeezed the San Fernando 
Valley, with mountains from both the north and south of it moving closer 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Refining previous figures, scientists Friday estimated the Santa Susanas were 
raised by about 15 inches in the quake and that the Castaic Junction dropped by 
3 1/2 inches. The cracking most likely resulted from rumpling of the earth's 
crust as it was pushed together, much like a fold in a carpet, with the 
fractures occurring across the rumple's surface, Williams said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired mining geologist, Frank Cox, who was hiking in the Santa Susanas on 
Friday, reported that he had come upon an extensive network of fractures and 
rifts on a steep ridge above Omelveny Park near the mouth of Bee Canyon in 
Granada Hills. He said that in some spots, the hard-packed earth had been 
uplifted a foot and in other areas cracks had created a jigsaw puzzle effect.

NOW ON SALE: LENIN-STYLE EMBALMING; RUSSIA: AS FOLLOWERS CELEBRATE 70TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMUNIST LEADER'S DEATH, HIS CORPSE'S CURATORS HOPE TO 
PRESERVE PROFITS IN NEW OPEN MARKET.

 Die-hard Communists laid wreaths and made speeches Friday to mark the 70th 
anniversary of I. Lenin's death, but it was the Soviet founder's embalmers who 
made the big news. If they were a little more commercially savvy, they could 
have billed it as a special anniversary offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's true: For between $250,000 and $300,000 you too can have your dear 
departed preserved for just about all eternity by the very formaldehyde wizards 
who have kept Lenin in viewing condition all these years. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't worry about building a whole mausoleum to house the corpse; Russian 
suppliers can put together a nice home sarcophagus for easy viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grandchildren will be able to look at their grandfather and say, 'That was my 
granddad,' without needing any portraits," said Georgy Tishchenko, a scientist 
at the formerly top-secret Institute for Biological Structures that maintains 
Lenin's corpse. And "the soul will have a place to return to after the 
resurrection." 
</P>
<P>
 The institute was forced to seek commercial profits after the Russian 
government cut off funds for the Red Square mausoleum where Lenin's body lies 
in state, the Itar-Tass news agency reported. So it got together with a Moscow 
firm called Ritual Service in November and recently began offering its 
embalming expertise on the consumer market. 
</P>
<P>
 It has no takers yet for the full Lenin Deluxe, officials say. They call the 
Lenin process "embalming with the goal of preserving for an indefinite period" 
-- but the institute has begun performing lesser procedures on other corpses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there will be orders, because there are people who are extraordinary 
and have the means," Tishchenko said. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial procedure for a Lenin-style preservation takes six months, and 
then specialists need to spruce the body up every two years. Tishchenko refused 
to describe the embalmers' methods, but it is known that the maintenance on 
Lenin includes twice-weekly swabbings of his hands and face with preserving 
fluids, and immersion every 18 months in embalming liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 His suit is also changed occasionally. (He is currently wearing a dark tie 
with white polka-dots.) Among other posthumous testimonials for the Russian 
methods are Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh, Klement Gottwald of Czechoslovakia 
and a former Angolan leader. The institute missed out on Mao Tse-tung because 
of political differences at the time between the Soviet Union and China. 
</P>
<P>
 Institute workers told the Itar-Tass news agency they expect the orders for 
Lenin-style preservation to come mainly from Americans, from rich people who 
want to preserve themselves for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Tishchenko said that unlike the freezing of bodies done in the United States, 
the Lenin process offers no hope for returning to life. But it does promise the 
longest-term preservation around, and in a form far better than that used for 
Egyptian mummies. 
</P>
<P>
 He said an elaborate mausoleum like Lenin's, which keeps the corpse at 60.8 
degrees Fahrenheit, is not needed; a small sarcophagus suffices, and Russia's 
high-tech defense industry should be able to come up with one.

BANNED CHEMICALS FOUND ON SHIP WITH CARGO FROM CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A ship carrying cargo from China to the Middle East was recently inspected and 
found to contain illegal chemicals used for making dangerous weapons, U.S. 
officials acknowledged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship Asian Senator, which is of German origin, was examined at a Saudi 
Arabian port in a new demonstration of the intensified U.S. and international 
campaign to stop the spread of deadly weapons and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode is likely to touch off an exhaustive effort to determine who was 
responsible for arranging the sale of the chemicals -- a Chinese manufacturer, 
the shipper, the purchaser or a third-party intermediary. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials emphasized that the ship itself was not Chinese and that there 
is no indication at this point that Chinese authorities were responsible for, 
or even aware of, the shipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese Embassy in Washington had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese cooperated fully in the investigation, and they agreed that what 
was found was not good stuff," one State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
 International agreements prohibit the export of a number of chemicals that can 
be used to manufacture nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials did not specify Friday exactly what chemicals were found, but 
they said there was no doubt that the export of the chemicals was a violation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to some sources, the ship was carrying the chemicals to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials say that fact has not been confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 If Iraq was in fact the destination, the shipment would be in violation of the 
U.N. sanctions against Saddam Hussein, and any countries found responsible 
could be called before the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The new incident is reminiscent of the episode last summer in which American 
planes and warships for weeks tracked a Chinese ship, the Yin He, which U.S. 
intelligence officials believed was carrying chemical-weapons ingredients from 
China to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are important differences between the two cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier incident involved a Chinese ship carrying a Chinese cargo. The 
Chinese government complained angrily that there were no dangerous chemicals 
aboard the Yin He, and those protests led to a nasty diplomatic confrontation 
with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, an inspection of the Yin He at a Saudi Arabian port turned up no 
evidence of any chemical weapons precursors. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, U.S. officials said, there was no diplomatic confrontation between 
American and Chinese authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 And the inspection in Saudi Arabia this time was said to have turned up solid 
evidence of the dangerous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately known Friday how or why the German ship was required to 
submit to the inspection at the Saudi port. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. intelligence officials have made it clear that they are monitoring the 
shipments of chemicals, weapons and technology from China to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.S. officials, the Asian Senator is one of a number of ships 
owned by Germany's Senator lines. Although the ships are used primarily to 
transport cargo, some also rent out luxury cabins for small numbers of 
passengers who want the experience of traveling the world by freighter. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 description of the Asian Senator's facilities in the New York Times 
Travel section proclaimed: "Capacity five passengers, outdoor pool, 
international cuisine with German specialties, one sitting." For the fee of 
$7,960, the ship offered an 84-night cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said the Asian Senator has some "space-sharing" arrangements to 
trade open space and cargoes with other ships from Germany and from South Korea 
-- thus raising the possibility that the owners of the Asian Senator may have 
taken on the chemical shipments from someone else at the last minute and 
without knowing what was in the cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship made a number of stops on the way to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources familiar with the investigation of the incident, the 
Asian Senator stopped at the South Korean port of Pusan on Nov. 28, in Hong 
Kong on Dec. 3, in Singapore on Dec. 7 and in Saudi Arabia on Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last seven years, exports of dangerous weapons and materials from 
China to the Middle East have been one of the most sensitive and divisive 
issues between Washington and Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue first arose in 1987, when the Ronald Reagan Administration 
complained bitterly that China was selling Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher is preparing to meet Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen in Paris on Monday in the latest of a series of high-level contacts 
between the Clinton Administration and the Chinese government.

<P>
 Members of the lower house of Russia's new Parliament gave themselves a fat 
package of perks Friday that includes 48 days of paid vacation a year and 
salaries equal to those of Cabinet ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies will also get apartments in Moscow or a housing allowance equal to 
the cost of a suite at a four-star hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 450 legislators will get a car and a driver and free rides on 
Russia's airlines and railroads. 
</P>
<P>
 They gave themselves bonuses for work of "special intensity," the "right to be 
received immediately by heads of government organizations" and "services 
enjoyed by Cabinet ministers." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper Izvestia estimated it will cost taxpayers about $10,000 a month 
to pay for the legislators' perks and salaries.

MEXICAN SENATE OKS AMNESTY FOR INDIAN REBELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An amnesty law to bring a peaceful end to Mexico's New Year rebellion was 
overwhelmingly approved by the Senate on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, a bishop mediating the conflict said Indian rebels have sent 
the government a new response to the amnesty offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas in the impoverished southern 
state of Chiapas, called the amnesty a "very strong step" in ending the 
rebellion by about 2,000 Indians demanding land rights and decent living 
conditions. The uprising began Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate voted 54-0, with one abstention, on the amnesty proposed on Jan. 16 
by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The lower house of Congress, the 
Chamber of Deputies, approved the measure Thursday without opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The law would ensure freedom from prosecution for actions against the 
government between Jan. 1 and Jan. 20. But it requires rebels to free their 
hostages and turn in their arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's chief peace envoy, Manuel Camacho Solis, took further steps 
Thursday to lure the rebels to talks, announcing that the army would move out 
of towns it has occupied in recent days, posting itself on the outskirts.

MIDEAST PEACE NEGOTIATIONS TO RESUME IN U.S.; MEDIATION: FOCUS WILL BE ON 
RELATIONS BETWEEN ISRAEL, SYRIA. OFFICIALS HOPE TO CAPITALIZE ON CLINTON'S 
TALKS WITH ASSAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 American mediators, hoping to capitalize on President Clinton's summit with 
Syrian President Hafez Assad, have summoned Middle East peace negotiators to 
resume talks Monday focusing on the frosty relationship between Israel and 
Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings, to be held at the State Department, mark the resumption of the 
formal peace process that has been in limbo since September, when Israel and 
the Palestine Liberation Organization signed a skeleton plan for Palestinian 
self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and the PLO are engaged in intensive negotiations away from Washington 
to settle the troublesome details required to accomplish objectives outlined in 
their agreement, signed with much fanfare more than four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 While those discussions continue, attention here will focus on the separate 
talks between Israel and Syria, the region's most bitter adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Geneva meeting last week with Clinton, Assad offered new assurances 
that Syria is serious about peace. 
</P>
<P>
 He described it as a "strategic option" for Damascus, meaning Syria considers 
peace an end in itself, not just a tactical means toward some other objective. 
</P>
<P>
 But the wily Assad refused to be pinned down on exactly what he means by 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria has long said it is willing to exchange "full peace" for a total Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau that Israel seized from 
Syria in the 1967 Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in a speech Wednesday in Tel Aviv 
that he doubts if Syria is willing to accept Israel's definition of peace -- 
exchange of ambassadors, open borders and free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials expressed optimism that the Clinton-Assad talks will break the 
deadlock between Israel and Syria. Non-government experts on the Middle East 
are far more skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can't hurt," Goeffrey Kemp, a former National Security Council regional 
specialist, said of the Clinton-Assad talks. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said if the Clinton-Assad meeting has really produced a 
subtle change in Syrian attitudes, the opening can be explored only in secret 
meetings between Israel and Syria -- away from the Washington negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I'm convinced of is that if something did happen, if there is 
a chink in the door, the meeting will have to be a lot more private," said 
Kemp, now a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike earlier rounds, Monday's talks will be conducted by heads of the 
Israeli, Syrian, Lebanese, Jordanian and Palestinian delegations, instead of by 
the full bargaining teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The American sponsors believe that the less-formal setting will permit the 
give-and-take bargaining that was rare in earlier sessions of the peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to keep the stakes down so the parties don't have to make 
statements whenever they go in or out of the door," a State Department official 
said. "We're trying to make it a little easier for them, a little lower 
profile." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Middle East experts consider the Washington talks little more than a 
holding action to keep the process going until Assad and Rabin are ready to 
take decisive action. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, the negotiations are a demonstration of the willingness of the 
adversaries to keep talking to each other, but there is little likelihood of a 
breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is whether the Washington negotiations have much to do with 
anything," said William B. Quandt, a former National Security Council Middle 
East specialist. "Assad is so central to the process that it is hard to believe 
he will delegate much authority to the negotiators. Similarly, Rabin is 
unlikely to delegate much authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next determination that the Americans must make is when to try to 
increase the tempo of the negotiations, not through the formal process in 
Washington but perhaps through another shuttle by (Secretary of State Warren) 
Christopher," said Quandt, now a scholar at the Brookings Institution in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials said Christopher has "penciled in" a Middle East trip in 
February or March, but no decision has been made on whether he will go through 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding any change in atmosphere resulting from Assad's meeting with 
Clinton, the Israel-Syria dispute is by far the most troublesome in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, both Assad and Rabin are insisting that they want peace but only on 
their own terms. The deadlock may be easing, but, if so, the process is a very 
slow one. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin conceded recently that Syria is unlikely to relax its demand for total 
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.  
</P>
<P>
 He said Assad is unlikely to put aside the "Egypt precedent," in which Israel 
agreed to a complete return of the Sinai Peninsula as part of its peace treaty 
with Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Rabin agrees to return the Golan, the pact would surely touch off a 
major political crisis in Israel. Rabin has said he would submit such an 
agreement to a referendum and would go through with it only if he wins the 
support of a majority of the Israeli public. 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring the constraints under which Rabin must operate, Benjamin 
Netanyahu, head of the opposition Likud Party, flew to Washington on Wednesday 
to deliver a message that Rabin has no mandate to even talk about surrendering 
any part of the Golan. 
</P>
<P>
 Netanyahu, Israel's top negotiator in the Likud-led government of former Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said Rabin's offer of a plebiscite on a peace 
agreement is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 He demanded that Rabin call new elections, in which Likud would campaign on a 
platform of refusing to give up the Golan. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that Syria eventually will agree to make peace without getting 
back the plateau -- a view clearly not shared by Rabin or the Clinton 
Administration.

ELDEST SON OF SYRIA'S PRESIDENT ASSAD IS KILLED IN CAR CRASH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Presi dent Hafez Assad's eldest son and presumed political heir to the 
leadership of Syria died Friday in an auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Basil Assad, 31, emerged two years ago as the expected successor to the 
63-year-old president, who has ruled Syria with an iron grip since 1970.Basil 
Assad was considered his father's favorite and was apparently being groomed to 
carry on the dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 A Syrian army major and head of presidential security, Basil Assad would have 
been constitutionally barred from assuming the presidency until he was 40. But 
he was expected to inherit his father's office, or at least become a front man 
for Hafez Assad's powerful lieutenants, when the president passes from the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Basil was headed for the airport to catch a flight to Germany, driving at 
speeds of up to 80 m.p.h. along the foggy highway, sources close to the family 
said. He missed the airport turnoff and slammed into a barrier, they reported, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Basil's cousin, Hafez Makhlouf, 24, was treated for a head wound. A back-seat 
passenger, the chauffeur who would return the car, was unhurt, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the death could affect Syria's future, it was not expected to change 
Syria's negotiating strategy or positions in Middle East peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 At his summit with President Clinton in Geneva on Sunday, Hafez Assad said he 
was serious about reaching a peace treaty with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Syrians took to the streets after the accident, some weeping as 
they converged on Assad University Hospital, where Basil Assad's body lay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the people around and you can realize how popular Basil was," said 
Cpl. Kaser Asfour, 27, of Hama. 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral was to be held today in Kardahah, Assad's hometown in the 
northwest, after noon prayers.

ANGER AT ARAFAT REFLECTS A POLITICAL SHIFT; MIDEAST: PALESTINIANS PREPARING FOR 
SELF-GOVERNMENT QUESTION THE ROLE AND AUTOCRATIC STYLE OF THE PLO LEADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Resplendent in its gilt frame, the large oil portrait on the back wall of 
Wahid Shakaa's popular coffeehouse deep in the casbah of Nablus is of a smiling 
Yasser Arafat, wearing his trademark black-and-white headdress arranged to fall 
as the map of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakaa put up the picture of the "president of Palestine," as it proclaims 
Arafat, when Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization concluded their 
agreement in September on Palestinian self-government; the coffeehouse's 
habitues had toasted the PLO chairman warmly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arafat's picture is no longer the object of veneration, a political icon 
revered by Shakaa's clientele. Instead, it is a target of angry, often fierce 
criticism as the men drink their coffee, play backgammon and debate the events 
of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is Yasser Arafat?" a middle-age merchant demanded, drawing calls of 
assent from around the room. "Where does he come from? Who are his family? Who 
are his uncles? Who is this Arafat?" 
</P>
<P>
 In Palestinian society, such questions are insultingly put to suggest that a 
man is a social upstart and a political pretender, that he is without family or 
clan, without community standing, without a real place in the history of the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The frequency with which these and similar questions are being asked in the 
coffeehouses of the West Bank and Gaza Strip reflects a major political shift 
under way among Palestinians: Arafat is losing popular support at a speed and 
to a degree that will make it difficult for him to govern once the terms for 
autonomy are agreed to with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Palestinian society is politically volatile, and today it is swinging hard 
against Arafat," an official from Fatah, Arafat's mainstream faction in the 
PLO, said at a weekend celebration here of Fatah's 29th anniversary. "The 
intellectuals, the bourgeoisie and the youth have always been fickle, but now 
our masses are swinging against the old man too. It's bad." 
</P>
<P>
 For Arafat, this has the potential of a major crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In recognizing Israel and agreeing on self-government for the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, Arafat effectively abandoned his power base for the last three 
decades -- Palestinians in refugee camps, in guerrilla units and in PLO 
structures abroad -- and adopted as his new constituency the Palestinians 
living in Gaza and the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yasser Arafat is welcome home -- as a refugee," said Hassan Ziad, 29, a 
resident of the Balata refugee camp here. "But as a 'hero' he should maybe stay 
in Tunis (the PLO's Tunisian headquarters). Palestinians have fought to govern 
themselves, not to have this old man come back after so many years outside the 
country and tell us what's what." 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism of Arafat is harsh and wide-ranging, reflecting real doubts 
about Arafat's ability to lead the Palestinians through the period of 
self-government to the independent state they hope for. 
</P>
<P>
 His critics assert that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Arafat is an autocrat, deciding things alone, frequently rejecting 
colleagues' advice, often ignoring the facts of a case. He rides roughshod over 
the PLO Executive Committee and its policy-making Central Council and does not 
understand that Palestinians want a democracy. Petitions are circulating 
demanding democratic reforms -- or Arafat's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arafat is appointing cronies to key posts in the Palestine National 
Authority, the new government, and passing over many from the communities here, 
many of whom had led the intifada, the rebellion against the Israeli 
occupation, and many of whom are better-educated and more experienced. Several 
Gaza leaders have quit their PLO and Fatah posts in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arafat has done nothing to halt the corruption believed rampant within the 
PLO and has yet to account for tens of billions of dollars given the 
organization by Arab governments and contributed in "taxes" by Palestinians 
themselves. Western countries have pledged extensive assistance but are 
hesitant to provide it without strict controls. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arafat is mishandling negotiations with Israel, both before and after the 
agreement on self-government, giving too much away on crucial issues such as 
the future of Jerusalem and then turning too tough in an attempt to win back 
what he lost. The erratic bargaining has delayed Israel's withdrawal from the 
Gaza Strip and the Jericho district in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mood is very bad, and, rightly or wrongly, people tend to blame Arafat 
and to dump everything on his head," Mahdi Abdul-Hadi, a leading Palestinian 
intellectual, said in Jerusalem. "Arafat is our leader -- we have said so now 
for almost 25 years -- and so on him are focused our hopes, our fears, our 
frustrations, not just our achievements." 
</P>
<P>
 The severe political malaise can be measured in the massive drop of support, 
from 65% to 42% between September and December, for the PLO agreement with 
Israel on Palestinian autonomy, according to opinion surveys conducted in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip by the Nablus-based Center for Palestine Research and 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Palestinians attribute the sour mood to the failure to realize the great 
expectations that came with the autonomy accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't tasted this 'peace' that Arafat has given us," said Nasser abu 
Arafeh, a regular at Shakaa's coffeehouse. "More than three months later, what 
do we have? A few prisoners released, a few men back from exile, a cease-fire 
that breaks down each day, and what else?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the last month of negotiations with Israel over implementation of the 
accord, Arafat has sought to show that he is a tough bargainer and, thus, a 
shrewd leader. He has sought maximum concessions and has been willing to go to 
the brink, to bluff, to ignore commitments made by PLO negotiators and to 
create deadlocks to get them. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Palestinians here are far from admiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just so much playacting," said Riad Malki, an engineering professor 
at Birzeit University who is prominent in the opposition Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine. "Having made the deal, Arafat has to carry through, 
and everyone, the Israelis and the Palestinians, know that. We think it was a 
bad deal, and we are not impressed by Arafat's efforts to make it less bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the current anger is personalized, directed at Arafat, just as the 
jubilation had been in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat has been found out -- the negotiations with Israel have shown him to 
be a man who knows how to order and dictate but not how to negotiate and 
conciliate," declared wall posters put up in the West Bank town of Ramallah by 
the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziad abu Amr, another Birzeit professor, observed as other intellectuals have: 
"We are not sure that the PLO leadership is capable of making the philosophical 
and intellectual shift from running a national liberation movement to running a 
civil society." 
</P>
<P>
 And five of the wealthiest Palestinian businessmen told Arafat in a strongly 
worded memorandum that he must abandon the "revolutionary mentality" and 
democratize the PLO -- or see the failure of this historic chance at achieving 
Palestinian independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Decisions have been made haphazardly; appointments have been based on 
connections, loyalty and forced obedience, not on qualifications, expertise and 
knowledge," they charged, accusing Arafat of "being satisfied with one opinion 
and turning a deaf ear to others." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Haidar Abdel-Shafi, the respected Gaza physician who had headed the 
Palestinian delegation to the Arab-Israeli peace talks in Washington, led a 
delegation to PLO headquarters in Tunis recently in an effort to persuade 
Arafat to share decision-making, to commit himself to national elections this 
summer and to appoint the best-qualified people regardless of political 
affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdel-Shafi got a polite hearing from Arafat but nothing more, according to 
Palestinian sources in Jerusalem, and that is likely to enrage -- and enlarge 
-- the dissident movement in the PLO's ranks, particularly in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a crisis of confidence both of the man and of the system," said 
Manuel Hassassian, a political scientist at Bethlehem University, "and it 
arises because the transition we are going through requires fundamental changes 
in the PLO and our whole political structure. . . . Given the character of 
Palestinian society, its essential pluralism, its desire for such institutions 
as a multi-party political system and market-led economy, the PLO has no other 
way except to democratize, to elect its leaders and to make fundamental 
decisions openly with full national participation." 
</P>
<P>
 Until Palestinians are able to hold national elections, Hassassian contended, 
they do not have -- and have never had -- a mechanism to reconcile political 
and social differences.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our society is full of actual and potential conflicts today," Abdul-Hadi 
said. "We have different political factions -- those that support the peace 
process and those that oppose it, those that want a secular state and those 
that seek a pan-Islamic nation, those who are Marxists and those who are social 
democrats, those who have lived under occupation and those who have lived in 
exile." 
</P>
<P>
 The list goes on, because there are strong differences between Palestinians in 
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, among Palestinians from the West Bank towns 
of Nablus, Ramallah, Bethlehem and Hebron, among the major Palestinian clans 
and, increasingly, between generations of activists. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Palestinians, this diversity argues for an open political system 
based on pluralism. That demand began almost a year ago with calls among 
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for major reforms within the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened to democracy?" Tawfik abu Khusa, a Fatah cadre member at 
the Arab Journalists Union in Gaza, asked last month as he and others protested 
Arafat's recent appointments there and called for broader participation in 
local politics. "The leadership won't be able to rally the people behind the 
PLO with the faces it has chosen. Democracy is not top down, but bottom up." 
</P>
<P>
 But since he assumed leadership of the PLO in 1969, Arafat has always 
centralized decision-making, securing his hold on power but also minimizing the 
movement's tendency to fragment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leadership has shoved aside the people who have struggled and who have 
sacrificed for the cause," Zakaria Talmas, another leader of the intifada in 
Gaza over the last six years, complained as he too quit to protest Arafat's 
approach. "We refuse to have leaders who lived in five-star hotels eating fish 
and chocolate while our people starve. The real leaders are those who are in 
the field, not at the swimming pool, who got their education in prison, not on 
the boulevards of Paris."

U.N. CHIEF CONSIDERING AIR STRIKES ON SERBS UNLESS THEY ALLOW TROOP ROTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said Friday that he is 
considering ordering air strikes against Serbian forces unless they allow the 
rotation of U.N. peacekeeping troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina within days. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali said he has not gotten a request for air strikes, which would be 
undertaken by NATO planes, but his remarks appeared to reflect growing 
impatience with the lack of Serbian cooperation with the U.N. mission in 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I am in favor of the use of air power," Boutros-Ghali said. "If 
we receive a request, I will certainly give the green light after consultation 
with the Security Council." 
</P>
<P>
 He has said in the past that he would order air strikes if he gets a 
recommendation from his special envoy in the former Yugoslav federation, 
Yasushi Akashi, and his military commanders in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week in Brussels, North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders stated their 
commitment to use air strikes if necessary to protect U.N. troops guarding the 
Muslim enclave of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia and open an air strip at Tuzla 
in northern Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutch peacekeepers were supposed to replace Canadian troops protecting 
Srebrenica, but Serbian gunners surrounding the enclave have blocked the 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Serbs have apparently agreed to the Srebrenica rotation, they have 
said no to opening the Tuzla airport for humanitarian aid flights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have received today information that the problem (in Srebrenica) is on the 
point of being resolved," Boutros-Ghali told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the rotation) does not happen, then we will have to make the decision to 
use air power." 
</P>
<P>
 Air strikes would have to be authorized by Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before agreeing to use air power, we have to agree on what our plan of action 
will be, and that is what we are doing now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi presented a cease-fire plan earlier this week, and Boutros-Ghali said 
that he hopes it will be agreed to by the Serbian forces.

IN WWII RITES, PUBLIC PAGEANTRY AND PRIVATE PILGRIMAGES; ANNIVERSARY: A 
HALF-CENTURY LATER, CEREMONY IN ITALY OPENS A YEAR OF BITTERSWEET MEMORIALS TO 
THE WAR.

 Rifleman Clyde E. Easter, U.S. Army, waded into Anzio in the fearful pre-dawn 
50 years ago this morning. He left on a stretcher, twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Easter is back, and others like him, to remember places and pain that 
defined his own life -- and the history of a continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Combi, who has always lived near the beaches of Anzio and neighboring 
Nettuno, is glad to see the old American soldiers return. He owes them a lot. 
And he buried many of their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans are still liberators here," said Giuseppe Tarisciotti, the 
Socialist mayor of this seaside resort 37 miles south of Rome. "But people are 
beginning to forget, so we are using the anniversary to remind the younger ones 
of their town's history." 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Anzio was famous only as the birthplace of the Roman emperors Nero and 
Caligula. Then, on Jan. 22, 1944, the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division and the 
British 1st Division -- VI Corps -- landed in Nettuno and Anzio, one of two 
amphibious invasions that year that turned the tide of World War II in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceremonies at British and American military cemeteries here today open a year 
of bittersweet memorials across Europe marking decisive 1944 on its golden 
anniversary. Before the year is out, Europeans and their governments in every 
Allied country will pause to remember. President Clinton comes to the 
Nettuno-Anzio battleground in June and then flies to D-Day memorials on the 
Normandy coast of northern France. 
</P>
<P>
 In a poignant counterpoint to official pageantry, individual veterans like 
Clyde Easter will undertake private pilgrimages this year to salute fallen 
comrades and to hone personal memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for millions of Americans, there will never be a Europe quite like the 
caldron Europe of 1944. The year began with German armies as masters of a 
fortress continent. By the time it ended, Rome, Paris and Brussels had been 
liberated by Allied armies and 1,000-plane raids by American and British 
bombers were common. Rebuffing a desperate German counterattack in Belgium at 
the Battle of the Bulge, American forces drove east, while Russian allies 
thrust west toward Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years ago. And only yesterday . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Rifleman Easter was a country boy from Cana, Va., not quite 19, when he 
invaded Anzio with the 7th Regiment of the 3rd. He remembers the tremendous 
naval barrage and the landing in darkness on a rainy, disagreeable night in an 
alien and backward place: deserted cobblestone streets, empty buildings, raw 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting later across the flat, deadly countryside, Easter would encounter 
centuries-old farmhouses and people living in great poverty amid oxen, bicycles 
and trucks powered by burning wood; he would see destruction and desolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice wounded, Easter was carried out of Anzio, thinking himself lucky to be 
alive. But he first returned in 1985 to examine with the perspective of four 
decades the ground where he had fought and fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking one day through the countryside, Easter came upon a farmhouse he had 
last seen not long before he was wounded. "A lady of about 75 came to the door 
looking quizzical, so I pointed to myself and said, Soldato Americano, and she 
put her arms around me and hugged me up," he remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nettuno and Anzio were evacuated but undefended 50 years ago this morning: 
Occupying Germans had driven townsfolk away and forbidden them to return under 
pain of death, but the landing surprised the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 On invasion night, Antonio Combi and other displaced townsfolk roused from 
straw-covered shelters and caves to watch artillery fire light up the sky. They 
were frightened. But mostly they were hungry. "We were eating grass, weeds," 
recalls the sprightly, blue-eyed Combi. He is 75 now and lives in retirement a 
grenade's throw from the Nettuno cemetery where 7,862 Americans are buried, 
including 21 sets of brothers, side by side. 
</P>
<P>
 That first day on the ground half a century ago was deceptive; the serious 
dying would not come until later in three German counterattacks against 
beachhead defenders with their backs to the sea for four killing months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had expected opposition, but at first everything was quiet until we got 
inland three or four miles," remembers Easter, who says he can still pinpoint 
places where buildings were destroyed and later rebuilt. "So much has changed. 
The town of Cisterna is beautiful now, but it was all rubble then. Still, every 
now and then I see something, a place, a building, that says to me, 'Anzio 
'44.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Adele Combi, who would marry Antonio in April, 1944, with German shells 
punctuating their vows, remembers what the arrival of Americans meant. "When we 
saw the soldiers, people yelled, 'Gli Americani! Maybe they'll give us 
something to eat,' " she said. "They did, but many people ate so much so fast 
they got sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the landing, the Americans began digging a temporary cemetery. 
Antonio Combi was one of the lucky ones hired to help. He remembers: bodies and 
bodies stacked in trucks; stray artillery rounds that killed the American 
engineer sergeant overseeing the cemetery construction, and an Italian American 
noncom named Nicola who spoke perfect Neapolitan and said to him one day, 
"Tony, somebody with a fiancee that pretty should have decent shoes" -- and 
scrounged him a pair. 
</P>
<P>
 Combi remembers how, during breaks from the digging, Americans at the cemetery 
taught Italians to play a strange game. It took: last year, Nettuno's 
professional baseball team won the Italian national championship for the 14th 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anzio invasion was intended to outflank Germans stubbornly defending the 
Gustav Line between Naples and Rome. Operation Shingle (as in beach, not roof) 
stalled: VI Corps failed to break out of the beachhead and was nearly swamped 
by the counterattacks. The operation has been controversial among military 
historians ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 But survivors like Easter and the Combi family lived more in life-and-death 
minutiae than grand strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Easter remembers the night patrols: "They'd send eight of us out and say, 
'Bring back a German prisoner.' Practically every night, one or two of us would 
get wounded. One night I got shot in the hand. After a month in the hospital, 
when I rejoined my outfit, I didn't know anybody: They were all transferred, 
wounded or dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Attacking the inland town of Cisterna in May, Easter was wounded again, this 
time by shrapnel in the face. By the time he got out of the hospital, Rome was 
free. When the war ended, Easter went home, moved to Nashville, Tenn., and 
worked in restaurants and real estate before retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nettuno and Anzio -- 90% destroyed -- life resumed, dirt poor, once the 
front moved north. Combi dug in the cemetery by day and by night sewed leather 
leggings for soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly at first, then with rapid acceleration, development came to Anzio and 
Nettuno. A Colgate-Palmolive factory triggered local prosperity, which was 
reinforced in the boom '60s by more light industries and the growth of tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Anzio, population 37,000, is hard for veterans such as Easter to 
recognize. The city quadruples in size at the height of summer. Its eight miles 
or so of beaches are good for swimming, but swatches of the bay are off-limits 
to the town's small fleet of fishing trawlers: The seabed is littered with 
sunken ships from the Allied landing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today the problems of Anzio are those of Italy," Mayor Tarisciotti said after 
meeting 30 residents with problems one morning this week. "They were worried 
about jobs and housing -- the things that trouble all Italians." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the young people of Nettuno and Anzio don't know or care much 
about World War II, their elders complain. Instead, they play video games and 
loud music, dress outlandishly and drive too fast. Fifty years later, Anzio 
lives in a different universe from the rural adversity to which Antonio Combi 
was born and into which Clyde Easter stumbled as a teen-age infantryman. 
</P>
<P>
 Combi, who became a supervisor and stayed 13 years at the cemetery, eventually 
joined the mushrooming Italian middle class and is now comfortably retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he never learned to drive; the family's first car was daughter Ana 
Maria's. Conceived in war and now 49, she still remembers the historic day when 
the Combis got wheels: On July 10, 1970, they became proud owners of a tiny 
Fiat 500, the symbol of the average Italian family's breakthrough to 
prosperity. And how time moves. Gravedigger Antonio's son-in-law is an 
air-traffic controller. His grandson is a pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Bravely, Easter has rented a car for his return to Anzio. The traffic chaos of 
modern Italy is as close as he ever wants to come again to combat, Easter says. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning, Antonio Combi will go to the 77-acre cemetery in Nettuno he 
helped build -- "every plant passed through my hands" -- to watch with almost 
proprietary pride as Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi renews Italy's thanks 
to young Americans who never went home. 
</P>
<P>
 For Easter, who now lives in Fancy Gap, Va., not far from where he was born, 
the cemetery is not easy. He's been there before. "I have friends there. In 
'85, I got out of the car and broke all up. I'm reluctant to go back," Easter 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll go back nonetheless. Easter will march into that cemetery with a 
blue-and-white-check 3rd Division insignia on his lapel this morning because a 
soldier does what a soldier does. Especially 50 years later.

STRONG EARTHQUAKE RATTLES EASTERN INDONESIA; 6 KILLED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A strong earthquake rocked eastern Indonesia on Friday, killing at least six 
people and injuring more than 50. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second quake in Indonesia this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake measured a 7.3 magnitude. The 
Meteorology and Geophysics Agency in Indonesia said it measured 6.8. The 
epicenter was on Halmahera, a group of islands 1,550 miles east of Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
 The province's deputy governor, Thaib Armaya, said six people died when houses 
collapsed on them. He said at least 16 villages were badly damaged and about 
200 villagers were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the quake triggered tidal waves that washed about half a mile 
onto shore. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake struck at 11:25 a.m., said Rebecca Phipps, spokeswoman for the U.S. 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the same region on Wednesday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake killed at least 2,500 people and 
destroyed thousands of buildings and houses in the Flores Island region of 
Indonesia, 950 miles southeast of Jakarta.

BRAZIL CONGRESS TAKES AIM AT CORRUPTION; SCANDAL: PANEL RECOMMENDS 18 
LEGISLATORS BE EXPELLED. MOVE IS CALLED AN EFFORT TO RESCUE 'THE DIGNITY OF THE 
NATION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tarnished by scandal, its credibility slumping, Brazil's Congress took a bold 
step against political corruption Friday when an investigating panel 
recommended "cutting its own flesh" by expelling 18 legislators caught in a 
massive kickback and influence-peddling scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 The 44-member panel issued its recommendations in a lengthy report that capped 
a three-month investigation into the shadowy dealings of Brazil's so-called 
budget mafia from 1989 through 1992. Weighing five pounds and as thick as an 
encyclopedia, the 400-page document detailed how a small group of lawmakers, 
together with bureaucrats and business leaders, conspired to siphon off 
millions, and perhaps billions, of dollars from the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel accused the 18 legislators of "breach of parliamentary decorum" and 
targeted 22 more for further investigation. The panel also recommended measures 
to impose new strictures on Brazil's porous budgetary process and even called 
for disbanding the budget committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Panel members hailed the findings as a blow to the succession of scandals that 
has buffeted the highest offices in Brazil in recent months. One legislator 
called the report nothing less than a move to rescue "the dignity of the 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 13 months ago, President Fernando Collor de Mello was impeached for 
profiting from a corruption scheme. His former campaign treasurer and alleged 
partner in crime, Paulo Cesar Farias, was sentenced last month to four years in 
jail for tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressional panel has no power to punish the legislators. However, its 
findings are likely to pave the way for Brazil's biggest political purge in the 
nation's democratic history. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming weeks, the full Congress will convene to vote on the fate of the 18 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the panel's presentation Friday, the chief author of the report, 
Roberto Magalhaes, read solemnly from the five-volume document. His voice thick 
with emotion, he quoted Aristotle, Machiavelli and Latin American liberator 
Simon Bolivar. In a daylong session broadcast on nationwide television, panel 
members took turns reading until they finished the entire document. 
</P>
<P>
 They detailed how lawmakers, bureaucrats and contractors had taken the state 
by "assault," pocketing kickbacks in return for channeling budget funds to 
projects that benefited friends, relatives and clients in a scheme that bled 
government coffers of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some (legislators) came to government already corrupt," Magalhaes said. 
"Others were driven to corruption by power." While private fortunes and 
interests flourished, he said, the nation had been "orphaned." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those accused in the report were Sen. Ibsen Pinheiro, a former president 
of the Congress, unable to explain how almost $2.5 million landed in his bank 
account; Ricardo Fiuza, a former Cabinet minister, accused of illegally 
inserting more than 300 extra items into the 1992 federal budget, costing 
taxpayers $240 million; and Congressman Joao Alves, former head of the budget 
committee and allegedly the don of the budget mafia, who pocketed $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Government prosecutor Aristides Junqueira is weighing criminal charges against 
the 18 legislators as well as three former Cabinet ministers, three governors 
and dozens of local politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, Congress is expected to open another probe into what investigators 
denounced as a "veritable cartel of contractors" who allegedly bribed 
legislators to win public bids and hasten the release of budget funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Corruption is nothing new in Brazil, but never had it reached so high and 
spread so wide. When generals ruled Brazil, the legislature had little real 
power and scant opportunity for scandal. When democracy returned in 1985, 
Congress was re-enfranchised, and some politicians helped themselves as they 
helped to forge the nation's budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget scandal broke in early October when Jose Carlos dos Santos, a 
former aide to the congressional budget committee, admitted taking up to $2.7 
million in payoffs for writing budget items on the orders of a gang of 
lawmakers known, because of their short stature, as the seven dwarfs. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Santos' lead, investigators questioned 48 witnesses, ranging from a 
congressional chauffeur to former ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent poll rated Congress and political parties among the least credible of 
Brazilian institutions. And voters appear to be acting on their discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 "In each of the last three elections, almost 50% of incumbent legislators were 
voted out of office," said Alexandre de Barros, a political risk consultant.

PETITION REOPENS WOUND IN FRENCH BLOOD SCANDAL; HEALTH: LETTER SEEKS PARDON FOR 
TWO DOCTORS WHO WERE JAILED FOR GIVING AIDS-TAINTED PRODUCTS TO HEMOPHILIACS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a year after two French doctors were sent to prison for knowingly 
giving AIDS-infected blood products to hemophiliacs, the debate over the 
scandal was reignited this week by a petition from 98 doctors and scientists 
worldwide seeking a pardon for the prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter to President Francois Mitterrand, the first such appeal since the 
1992 verdict in the blood scandal, was sharply criticized Friday by other 
doctors, AIDS activist groups, the families of 300 hemophiliacs who have died 
of AIDS and 900 more who are known to be infected. 
</P>
<P>
 "To make this demand while the victims of this tragedy are dying is showing 
unbelievable indecency," said Dr. Jacques Leibowitch, an immunologist and head 
of the Raymond-Poincare Hospital outside Paris. "It is also a sort of 
confession. Those who signed are saying, 'We didn't act so differently in 
1985.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The French branch of ACT UP, an AIDS activist group based in New York, 
described the petition, signed Wednesday by doctors and researchers from nine 
countries including the United States, an "undignified plea." And it blamed the 
"corporate reflex" of doctors for the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was summed up by an editorial cartoon on the front page of the 
influential daily Le Monde on Friday. It showed a smiling doctor asking a 
patient on life-support systems to sign the petition. Receiving no reply, the 
doctor promises: "I'll come back later. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in making their appeal to Mitterrand, the signatories seemed 
especially concerned with the precedent that the case had set as a threat to 
medical progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they expressed "solidarity and compassion" for the hemophiliacs, the 
signatories said, "It is our duty to guard against any unjustified sentiment of 
mistrust against doctors and medical science." 
</P>
<P>
 The petition said the verdicts had been "an unprecedented 'trial by media' (in 
which) sensationalism dominated to the detriment of accuracy." And it expressed 
concern that "the fear of legal reprisals could divert doctors and scientists 
from assuming their duties." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gille-Patrice Cassuto, head of the hematology department at the University 
Hospital Centre in Amiens, said that when he was asked to sign the petition, "I 
didn't think for one moment of doing it. And the way this is going to be seen 
is that again, as always, the doctors are on one side and society is on the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 What most doctors and even the victims of the scandal do agree on is that high 
government officials, protected from ordinary justice by government immunity as 
members of Parliament, should also have been accused in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in fact, the law protecting them changed just days ago. Under the new 
law, a special 15-member "court of justice" has been set up to handle charges 
made against government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Lecoq, a lawyer representing 19-year-old Ludovic Bouchet, who was infected 
with the HIV virus via blood products, filed suit Thursday against Laurent 
Fabius, who was prime minister at the time, and two of his government 
ministers. Lecoq's suit accuses the trio of delaying the introduction of the 
American blood-screening test for months until French researchers could develop 
their own test. He also has accused them of "poisoning" his client. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal defendant in the original case was Michel Garretta, former 
director of the country's blood bank, who was sentenced to four years in 
prison. Dr. Jean-Pierre Allain, chief researcher for the National Center for 
Blood Transfusion, was given a two-year sentence. A third doctor received a 
suspended sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men already have served more than a year of their sentences, and they are 
both likely to walk free long before their colleagues' appeal for a pardon 
wends its way through the government bureaucracy, a Mitterrand spokesman said. 
Garretta is eligible for parole this summer, and lawyers said that Allain could 
go free earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 An appeals court last July, in upholding the convictions, said Garretta had, 
in 1985, continued to supply contaminated blood products to French hemophiliacs 
at least six months after an American blood-screening test and heat-treatment 
process, which prevents contamination, were perfected and being used in other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Garretta, 49, admitted in his testimony that he had made serious errors. 
"Today, it's clear. It was a mistake." But, in his defense, he said everybody 
in the French government "knew about it, including me."

NEWS ANALYSIS; MAJOR DODGES BULLET IN PROBE OVER SALES TO IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With unprecedented testimony before an independent inquiry, Prime Minister 
John Major has, for now, sidestepped a political land mine involving what 
Conservative governments he has served in may have known about British sales of 
militarily sensitive equipment to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition Labor Party had hoped that Tory officials would be politically 
tarred when they were forced to admit that they broke their own rules and 
shipped critical supplies -- arms-making machine tools and other "dual-use" 
equipment -- to Baghdad before the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Major -- following the example of his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, who gave 
hostile testimony to an investigative panel headed by Lord Justice Richard 
Scott -- denied specific knowledge of a change in the government guidelines on 
dual-use exports to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Although less frosty than Thatcher, Major still managed to be equally reticent 
about export laws that governed the British-Iraqi transactions that occurred 
during the time he was a treasury minister, foreign secretary, chancellor of 
the Exchequer and even until late 1992, when he was prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 His appearance this week marked the first time in parliamentary history that a 
serving prime minister had gone before an outside, investigative tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 Major contended that if there were changes made to the export regulations, 
effectively barring dual-use sales to Iraq, he knew nothing of them and 
suggested they had been made by junior ministers who failed to tell him and 
other senior officials about them. 
</P>
<P>
 That argument infuriated Labor Party leader John Smith, who had predicted that 
the prime minister's testimony would expose him as "a knave or a fool," because 
in early 1992 Major had declared that the guidelines had been followed. 
</P>
<P>
 The rough export rules were originally announced to Parliament in October, 
1985, and were secretly relaxed in December, 1988 -- a decision that, testimony 
has indicated, was agreed to by senior officials in the foreign, defense and 
trade ministries. The rule relaxation led to exports of machine tools and 
engineering equipment that could be used to manufacture arms. Matrix Churchill 
Co. was one of the companies charged by the Customs Office with violating the 
rules to conduct illegal trade with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial against Matrix Churchill officials collapsed in November, 1992, when 
the defense showed that British intelligence knew that the parts might have 
military uses and that the Department of Trade had approved the shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Clark, the outspoken former junior defense minister, has told the inquiry 
that the guidelines were fudged to help British companies compete for Iraqi 
sales. Clark has admitted being "economical with the truth" in publicly 
advising Parliament on the case. But he argued that British jobs were at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe has uncovered the cozy way -- even by British standards -- that 
business was conducted in Thatcher-Major governments: It was kept from public 
and parliamentary view. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inquiry has uncovered layers of scandal," said Anthony Sampson, a social 
historian. "Most seriously, it reveals the lack of any effective check on the 
abuses of power."

AGENT TESTIFIES ABOUT FATAL RAID ON DAVIDIANS, CONTINGENCY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A defense attorney grilled a federal agent Friday on the decision to go ahead 
with a raid on religious leader David Koresh despite a plan to abort the move 
if the element of surprise was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 In the federal murder trial of 11 Branch Davidians, attorney Tim Evans asked 
special agent Barbara Maxwell about a decision by supervisors to send two 
cattle trailers full of agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
to confront Koresh on Feb. 28, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "And no one told you that you were supposed to call that raid off if you lost 
the element of surprise?" Evans asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that could have been a contingency of the plan, yes," Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one did that though, did they?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, sir." 
</P>
<P>
 "You lost the element of surprise and your supervisors went ahead with (the 
raid) anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir." 
</P>
<P>
 Four agents were killed and 16 were wounded in the failed attempt to arrest 
Koresh on weapons charges. Six Branch Davidians also are believed to have been 
killed in the raid. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have said they will try to show that key ATF personnel 
ignored orders and risked their own agents' lives by sending them in against 
the heavily armed Davidians to pull off a high-profile success, needed to prove 
the agency's importance. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell's testimony echoed findings in a critical review of the raid by the 
Treasury Department, which concluded that supervisors Chuck Sarabyn and Phil 
Chojnacki defied orders by then-agency director Stephen E. Higgins to call off 
the raid if Koresh knew that agents were coming. 
</P>
<P>
 The report so far has not been allowed into the trial's evidence by U.S. 
District Judge Walter Smith Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 In other testimony Friday, ATF special agent Lowell Sprague recalled how a 
bulletproof vest on the body of a dead agent lying on top of him blocked 
gunfire during a bloody 45-minute battle with the Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprague told jurors how he attempted to rescue agent Steven Willis and said 
Willis' body ultimately saved him. Sprague said he rushed to assist Willis 
after watching him get shot in the head in front of the Davidian compound in 
Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Koresh and about 80 followers died April 19 when fire engulfed the compound, 
ending a 51-day standoff.BUREAU OF ALCOHOL TOBA

GOP ANALYSTS ASSAIL COSTS OF CLINTON HEALTH CARE PLAN; FORECAST: REPORT 
PREDICTS SHORTFALL OF AT LEAST $918 BILLION BY THE YEAR 2000 IF THE PROPOSALS 
ARE ENACTED. QUALITY OF CARE WILL SUFFER, IT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new analysis of President Clinton's health care reform plan by Republican 
members of Congress' Joint Economic Committee warns that the White House 
initiative will face a shortfall of at least $918 billion over its first six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessment, prepared by the committee's GOP staff members, stands in sharp 
contrast to the Administration's forecasts, which indicate that the health care 
overhaul will produce enough savings to reduce the federal budget deficit by 
almost $60 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP assessment will be released Monday by congressional Republicans and is 
the latest volley in what has become a war of competing economic 
prognostications about the untested system Clinton has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Its release will come a day before the President's State of the Union Address, 
which has been designed in part to reignite momentum behind the reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Administration was jubilant when an independent forecasting 
firm, Lewin-VHI of Fairfax, Va., predicted that Clinton's plan could achieve 
health coverage for all Americans without a broad-based tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lewin-VHI also found that the Administration had underestimated the 
costs of the benefits it proposed -- and exaggerated the savings it can achieve 
in health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The most influential of the forecasters will not weigh in until next month. 
Congressional Budget Office Director Robert D. Reischauer is expected to offer 
his own assessment of the Clinton plan in testimony before the House Ways and 
Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In its analysis, the Joint Economic Committee's Republican staff contended 
that even if the Administration's plan kept health care spending at the levels 
it claims, funds available to pay those costs would fall short by $918 billion 
through the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the GOP staff contended that the Administration is not being 
realistic in estimating that the costs of health care will be reined in under 
its proposal. To the contrary, it wrote, giving coverage to 37 million 
Americans who are now uninsured and increasing the benefits of tens of millions 
more will greatly increase the demand for health care services -- and 
presumably, their price. 
</P>
<P>
 Using its own assumptions about the costs of providing all Americans with 
health care benefits comparable to those offered by Fortune 500 firms, the 
Republican staff estimated that the shortfall actually could reach almost $2 
trillion through the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gap equals two-thirds of total individual income tax collections in 1995 
and grows to 95% of the individual income taxes that the federal government 
expects to collect at the end of the decade," according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.), a member of the House Republican leadership and a 
critic of the Clinton plan, said the only options for dealing with such a 
shortfall would be massive increases in the federal budget deficit, equally 
large increases in taxes, rationing of health care or a combination of the 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's plan "will result in the budgetary disaster detailed in this 
paper, and the quality of health care for most Americans will deteriorate," 
Armey wrote in a foreword to the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of the Joint Economic Committee is to study economic issues and make 
recommendations to Congress.

HEALTH PLAN FACES SEVERAL NEW OBSTACLES; REFORM: THE WHITE HOUSE PROPOSAL IS 
RETURNING TO CENTER STAGE JUST AS POLITICAL OPPOSITION IS GROWING AND PUBLIC 
ENTHUSIASM IS WANING.

<P>
 The health care debate -- nearly dormant since President Clinton offered up 
his 1,342-page reform prescription last fall, is about to resume in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 However, much has changed in the intervening months, and it is far from clear 
what form the health care revolution will take -- or even if truly sweeping 
changes will occur at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the new factors influencing the debate will include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The President's plan -- always a source of conflict between Republicans and 
Democrats on Capitol Hill -- now faces growing opposition from members of both 
parties in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 * The crisis atmosphere that prevailed through the 1992 presidential campaign 
and during most of Clinton's first year in office -- a sense that the health 
care system needed an immediate overhaul -- has abated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Much of the business community is increasingly skeptical about many elements 
of Clinton's complex reform agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health care cost inflation has slowed dramatically, threatening to further 
sap the will for a wholesale restructuring of one-seventh of the nation's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this makes it a lot more difficult politically to get it done," said a 
GOP congressional staff member involved in the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton could recapture the momentum, beginning with his State of the Union 
Address on Tuesday, and persuade Congress to enact some kind of major 
legislation before the congressional elections in November. But even in that 
event, there is virtual unanimity among those who follow the issue that the 
changes will fall short of those Clinton has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts say they believe that at a minimum, Congress will prohibit 
insurance companies from refusing to cover people with pre-existing medical 
conditions and will require the firms to base their premiums on broad, 
community rates, rather than on the medical experiences of small groups or 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Administration is holding firm on its proposal to require all 
employers to pay at least 80% of a full-time worker's insurance premiums, with 
individuals picking up the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fate of many other key elements of Clinton's plan are in considerable 
doubt, including the caps Clinton would like to set on the rate of insurance 
premium increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials are also sending strong signals that they may back 
away from the controversial linchpin of the plan -- the creation of massive 
health-insurance purchasing alliances, which would be used as hammers to drive 
down costs as health care providers compete for their huge contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 As presently designed, Clinton's plan would exempt a company from joining such 
an alliance only if it had a work force of 5,000 or more. Such companies would 
be allowed to set up their own alliances while paying a 1% payroll "assessment" 
to help provide subsidies to small businesses who would be required to join the 
standard alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Administration is thinking of eliminating the requirement, or keeping 
it but allowing companies with only a few hundred employees to set up their own 
alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Either concession is likely to lessen resistance in the business community to 
Clinton's overall agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The chances that the Clinton plan would be scaled back increased dramatically 
after the President, facing a cacophony of competing proposals, offered that he 
was open to all alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 That declaration may have emboldened opponents more than the White House had 
intended. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a terrible mistake," said Michael Bromberg, executive director of the 
Federation of American Health Systems and one of Washington's leading health 
care lobbyists. "The President was cutting deals before the real bargaining 
starts." 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot, according to Bromberg, will be "a total rewrite" of Clinton's 
proposal by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) and Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), who seek 
less sweeping, more incremental reforms than Clinton, appear to be gaining 
supporters. "Most members now feel: 'It's our bill now and we can do what we 
want,' " one congressional health staffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, Sen. Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) is sounding 
far less accommodating than he did last year, when he made several high-profile 
appearances with the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, the head 
of the Administration's health care task force. 
</P>
<P>
 And key Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, chairman of the 
Senate Finance Committee, has declared there is no health care crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Such statements, and a lack of clear direction from the White House, has 
created a sense of "panic on the Hill," said Diane Rowland, vice president of 
the Kaiser Family Foundation, a Menlo Park-based health care think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "People up there don't know what to do. Very few people are solidly behind any 
one proposal," said Rowland, who advised the presidential task force that 
developed the reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the health insurance industry, one of the most vociferous opponents 
of comprehensive reform, is continuing its attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real question is: Why are we throwing the whole system out?" said Linda 
Jenckes, vice president of the Health Insurance Industry of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all this, the government's own statistics show that both private and 
public spending on health care are moderating. Costs are still rising, but at 
the slowest rate in more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, one report said the government's two biggest health 
programs, Medicare and Medicaid, will cost $45 billion less over the next five 
fiscal years than was predicted only last fall. Another report said health care 
prices rose by just 5.4% last year, the smallest increase in two decades -- 
although that was still double the overall inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Such trends could lessen the sense of urgency to undertake comprehensive 
reform. But most economists agree that health care inflation historically has 
moderated in the face of demands for reform, only to resume after the momentum 
has dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gene Sperling, a White House economic adviser, put it: "These numbers do 
not show that it's morning in America. What they do show is that you can 
control prices without hurting quality." 
</P>
<P>
 While the debate over the merits of health care reform heats up, one seemingly 
unrelated matter could have a profound effect on the outcome: the emerging 
Whitewater controversy, which is under investigation by a special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Hillary Clinton supervised the development of the White House health 
care proposal, any damage to her reputation from the Whitewater affair could 
deliver a fatal blow to health care reform, analysts said.

NETWORKS AGREE TO MONITOR FOR VIOLENCE ON TV SHOWS; MEDIA: ACCORD PRECEDES 
CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE AND FOLLOWS SIMILAR CABLE PLAN. BUT BROADCASTERS ESCHEW 
CALLS FOR RATING SYSTEM AND PROGRAM BLOCKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN EDWARDS, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The four broadcast networks Friday reached an agreement in principle to use an 
independent monitor to review their programming for violent content. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement comes just days before Congress returns with the regulation of 
television violence high on its agenda and just as the major cable networks 
have agreed to use such a system. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable agreement was contained in an 11-point plan that also calls for the 
development of a violence rating system and endorses technology that would 
allow viewers to block programs rated as violent from their television sets. 
</P>
<P>
 The networks have been unwilling to support the latter two initiatives because 
they believe in part that such moves would cause advertiser defections. 
</P>
<P>
 The network accord, which was finalized in a conference call Friday by 
executives of NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox, still must be approved by the heads of the 
networks. That approval is expected in the next few days, and a formal 
announcement is likely early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Decisions as to who will run the system, how that person (or organization) 
will be chosen and to whom he will report are still to be worked out. It is 
unlikely, however, that the networks will employ the same monitor as the cable 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, sources say the monitoring system will be a "qualitative rather 
than quantitative" assessment of network programming. In a quantitative 
assessment, actions that are deemed violent are simply tabulated without regard 
to context, which means that cartoons and cop shows are given equal weight. 
</P>
<P>
 The effectiveness of the monitoring system is believed to rest on the fact 
that annual reports will be made public and that the threat of negative 
reactions from advertisers and the public is expected to keep the networks in 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Network executives are likely to present the plan early next week to Sen. Paul 
Simon (D-Ill.), who has been pushing for such a monitor system. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, reacting earlier Friday to both the cable initiative and the likelihood 
of the broadcasters' agreement, said he believed such action would alleviate 
the pressure for legislation to regulate TV violence. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, however, that he would prefer that cable and the broadcasters use the 
same monitor to ensure a consistent approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who introduced legislation on the so-called 
V-chip, the technology that would enable viewers to block certain programming, 
said Friday that he believed legislation would be inevitable if the broadcast 
networks did not join the cable industry in approving the technology and a 
rating system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about advertising," Markey said. "That's what this whole debate 
boils down to . . . Violence sells." 
</P>
<P>
 He said of the V-chip: "Even if a small percentage of parents used the 
technology, the networks will see declining ratings for violent programs. The 
result will be less violence on television." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the acceptance of a monitoring system is a major step for the four 
networks, which have resisted it for months, saying their own standards and 
practices operations are doing the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcasters have debated fiercely among themselves over whether a monitoring 
system would decrease the likelihood of legislation. ABC and CBS have been more 
receptive to the idea, with NBC and Fox more resistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Since summer the networks have been taking any steps they thought would help 
ward off congressional action. They believed then that they had satisfied 
lawmakers' push for action when they agreed to air parental advisories before 
shows with violent content. It was their understanding, spokesmen say, that 
Simon would then give them two years to let the advisories work and see what 
other action they took before pursuing further congressional inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 But Susan Kaplan, an attorney on Simon's staff overseeing television violence 
issues, said: "I never heard him say that, and I know that wasn't his view." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon on Friday termed this week's initiatives "a significant shift." He said 
he believed the monitoring system would ensure that network programmers 
continue to show less violence on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the V-chip was "not something that in my opinion is essential," adding 
that the V-chip is "not a substitute for reducing violence on television." 
</P>
<P>
 The tensions between the four networks and the cable industry were reflected 
to some degree in network reaction Friday to the cable plan for regulating 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Julie Hoover, ABC's vice president of corporate communications, 
said: "We are delighted that the cable industry has adopted some of the things 
we have been doing," referring to ABC's Department of Broadcast Standards and 
Practices, as well as to the network's scheduling of programs. "Virtually all 
our programs are rated G."

CLINTON TO HIGHLIGHT HEALTH CARE IN STATE OF UNION SPEECH; PRESIDENCY: HE'LL 
SEEK TO REGAIN MOMENTUM ON THE ISSUE. ADDRESS WILL ALSO FOCUS ON HIS COMMITMENT 
TO ELECTORATE TO WORK TO SOLVE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WOES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton plans to devote a full third of his State of the Union 
Address Tuesday to health care reform in a bid to restore momentum to the 
initiative, aides say. He also may disclose new details of Administration plans 
on gun control and welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In its broadest terms, the speech to a joint session of Congress is being 
crafted to address what the White House sees as Clinton's chief liability with 
voters -- a lack of trust. 
</P>
<P>
 On the economy, deficit reduction and other topics, Clinton intends to remind 
his audience of what he pledged to accomplish, review what his Administration 
has delivered so far and then lay out the steps that he believes are still 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overriding goal is to convince people that he is keeping his commitment 
to them," a senior White House official said. "And to demonstrate that what 
he's doing matters to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The speech will center on themes that Clinton has used to unite his agenda and 
appeal to the broad political center: work, community service, economic 
opportunity and family security. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing a well-received address he delivered in Memphis, Tenn., last November, 
the President will call for new efforts to fight violence and crime by building 
communities and strengthening families. 
</P>
<P>
 And to show that the White House is looking out for middle-class Americans, 
Clinton will list accomplishments he believes will benefit them greatly -- two 
new trade agreements, the family leave act, the Brady handgun-control measure 
and deficit-reduction efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's two earlier addresses to Congress, on his economic and health care 
plans, were generally well-received. The job he faces in this one is daunting. 
He must set the stage for a year that may bring decisive battles on his health 
care, welfare reform, job training and anti-crime initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, Clinton was cleaning up the plate on a lot of issues that were 
hanging around from the Bush-Reagan years," said Tony Coelho, a former 
California congressman who now advises the White House. "This year he will be 
moving onto issues that will be defining for his presidency." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also hopes to refocus public attention that has recently drifted from 
his legislative goals to questions surrounding his investments in the 
Whitewater land deal and other personal issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Regaining the momentum on health care will not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional and business opposition has hardened since the President 
unveiled his 1,342-page plan last fall, with a slowdown in the spiraling costs 
of medical care easing the urgency for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also will try to overcome critics' charges that he does not wish to 
push the divisive issue of welfare reform at the same time his health plan is 
occupying lawmakers' attention. He will argue, aides say, that health care and 
welfare reform must occur simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 And, sensitive to the public's increased concern about crime, Clinton has been 
saying that the nation needs to move beyond the Brady bill. His speech is 
likely to include a call for anti-crime measures that he has recently embraced, 
including a ban on assault weapons and an end to parole for violent repeat 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also is expected to call for swift enactment of the anti-crime bill 
that has taken different forms in the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 One aide hinted that Clinton is contemplating calling for other steps as well, 
but declined to disclose them because "we want to save something for a 
surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's review of the recently strengthened economy is expected to lead 
remarks about the training and education initiatives that will figure 
prominently in the Administration's 1994 efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 California's distress -- from earthquakes and other disasters -- also is 
likely to be mentioned. "He was there this week, and it's at the top of his 
mind," one aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign policy will be of secondary concern in Tuesday's address. But Clinton 
is expected to argue the primacy of economic concerns, including trade, in 
foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 And he will argue, as he did in Moscow last week, that closer global economic 
ties have made domestic and foreign concerns identical. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton began working on the speech before Christmas, and took the paperwork 
with him when he went home to Arkansas and later to Hilton Head, S. C., over 
New Year's weekend. He had several meetings on the speech this week, including 
one on the way back from Los Angeles on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He also took drafts with him Friday afternoon as he flew to Camp David, Md., 
for a weekend retreat. But there were signs Clinton was, characteristically, 
still far from his final text. 
</P>
<P>
 After a meeting Thursday afternoon, two speech-writing assistants were 
directed to redraft the address' health care section. And Friday, although a 
number of aides pored over copies of the draft, they predicted that Clinton 
would rewrite until the last moment and extemporize freely, as he did with his 
Feb. 17 economic address. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's written down here is likely to have, in fact, zero connection to what 
he says on Tuesday," an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Jack Nelson, David Lauter and Elizabeth Shogren 
contributed to this story.

'SWEET' RENO HAS WRONG JOB, GRAMM SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janet Reno is "a very sweet lady," but should not be attorney general because 
she cares "more about day care than . . . about violent crime," Sen. Phil Gramm 
(R-Tex.) said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe some people should have that priority, but I do not believe they 
should be attorney general of the United States," Gramm said in a speech to the 
Republican National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters afterward, Gramm said he did not mean to sound 
condescending. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish more people would call me sweet," he said with a smile. "I don't 
understand why they don't. . . . In fact, of all the Cabinet officials, I like 
her personally better than any of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is maybe a person with her perspective should be head of Health and 
Human Services," Gramm continued. "But I want the chief law enforcement 
official of the country to be more concerned about prosecuting criminals than 
about child care." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno has not said she thinks day care is more important than prosecuting 
violent crime. But she has said she believes that a root cause of crime is the 
lack of day care and other social services for low-income children. 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm said he thinks child care is "an important part of the puzzle, but it is 
not her part of the puzzle."

U.S. TO DEVELOP RULES FOR GULF VETERANS SEEKING DISABILITY AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the cause of pain, headaches and fatigue plaguing some Persian Gulf 
War veterans remains a mystery, officials said Friday they hope to create 
guidelines by this summer that will enable those afflicted to qualify for 
disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the departments of defense and veterans affairs and the 
National Institutes of Health will meet in May in an effort to develop 
diagnostic guidelines for what has become known as "Persian Gulf syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 Once that is done, benefits could become available to veterans "who can be 
shown to have that type of illness and associate that with their period of 
military service," said Dr. Robert Roswell, chief of staff at the VA medical 
center in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Roswell will direct the Persian Gulf Veterans Coordinating Board, established 
Friday to coordinate research into the unexplained ailments, medical treatment 
and the dissemination of information among the VA, the Defense Department and 
the Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Slightly less than 10% of the 30,000 disability claims submitted since the war 
ended in February, 1991, have been based on alleged exposures to various 
environmental hazards. They include Kuwaiti oil well fires, parasites, 
petrochemicals, tank shells made of depleted uranium, microwaves and possible 
traces of chemical and biological warfare agents. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the environment-related claims are being funneled through the VA's 
regional office in Louisville, Ky. Of approximately 2,800 submitted so far, 
more than 900 have been denied while 163 have been ruled service-connected 
disabilities, said Gary Hickman, director of the VA's compensation and pension 
service. About 1,700 remain unresolved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, this was a very environmentally dirty war," Roswell said. "I 
personally believe that we're likely to find that there are multiple causes for 
the symptoms that remain undiagnosed." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a bill passed by Congress last year, Gulf War veterans do not have to 
prove their illness's connection to their service to get treatment at the VA's 
172 hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe there are several hundred to possibly 1,000 or 2,000 veterans who 
have symptoms which at this time we're not able to adequately explain," Roswell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not excluding the possibility that chemical (warfare) agents might have 
been a factor even though the confirmed detections were only present in very, 
very low doses that probably would not be clinically significant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of the 650,000 military personnel who participated in the Persian 
Gulf War have been treated for other service-connected ailments and injuries.

FREEH'S PARTNER IN N.Y. HEROIN CASE IS NAMED FBI DEPUTY CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI Director Louis J. Freeh has named David Binney, who worked with him on the 
Pizza Connection heroin-trafficking case, to become deputy director of the 
bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Binney, 53, has been the assistant director in charge of the inspection 
division since May, 1992, and he "has excelled in complex assignments since 
becoming an FBI agent 24 years ago," Freeh said in a statement issued Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh and Binney worked together on the Pizza Connection case in New York in 
which Sicilian Mafia members used pizza parlors as fronts for heroin 
trafficking. Sixteen of the 17 co-defendants in that case were convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time the case was being developed, Freeh was a prosecutor in the U.S. 
attorney's office in New York City, heading the Organized Crime Task Force and 
the Pizza Connection prosecution. Binney was supervising an FBI organized crime 
squad working one aspect of the case, FBI spokesman Charles Mandigo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Binney, a 1964 West Point graduate with an undergraduate degree in 
engineering, earned a law degree from the University of Indiana Law School in 
1976. He served in the Army from June, 1964, to December, 1969, including a 
1966 tour of duty in Vietnam, and left with the rank of captain. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the FBI in 1970 and served in Milwaukee, Indianapolis and FBI 
headquarters before he became a supervisor investigating organized crime in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Binney succeeds Floyd I. Clarke in the bureau's No. 2 post. Clarke, who is 
retiring after 30 years of service, had been named to the position in 1989 by 
former FBI Director William S. Sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sessions was ousted last summer after an internal Justice Department report 
accused him of numerous ethical lapses.

 The Supreme Court said Friday that it will rule for the first time on whether 
abortion protesters have a free-speech right to carry picket signs and shout 
slogans on the sidewalks directly outside abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on an appeal from anti-abortion activists, the high court said it would 
review a Florida state judge's order barring protesters from "congregating, 
picketing, patrolling (or) demonstrating" on the sidewalk or street next to a 
clinic in Melbourne, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert McGregor imposed the order creating a "36-foot buffer zone" 
around the Aware Woman's Center after hundreds of Operation Rescue activists 
had regularly gathered there and shouted "child killer" and "murderer" at 
doctors, nurses and patients trying to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the protesters say the judge's order goes too far and violates the 
First Amendment because it bars peaceful protest on a public sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers for the clinic counter that no one has a right to harass and 
intimidate patients and doctors, even on a public sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which will be argued in April and decided by July, is likely to 
yield an important ruling clarifying the line between constitutionally 
protected protest and illegal intimidation and harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite more than a decade of growing protests near abortion facilities, the 
Supreme Court has avoided a broad ruling on abortion and the First Amendment. 
In a narrowly worded opinion in 1988, the court said that cities can restrict 
groups of protesters from gathering on a residential street directly in front 
of the home of a doctor who performs abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 But otherwise, the court had passed up repeated chances to confront the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-abortion leaders have maintained that their movement deserves the same 
protection from federal courts that was given civil rights protesters in the 
South, who relied on marches, sit-ins and boycotts to change discriminatory 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices had little choice but to decide the Florida case since two 
competing appellate courts had issued conflicting rulings on McGregor's order. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, a U.S. appeals court in Atlanta said that his order was 
unconstitutional because it "appears to criminalize various acts of peaceful 
protest." 
</P>
<P>
 But eight days later, acting on a separate appeal, the Florida Supreme Court 
unanimously ruled that the order did not violate the U.S. Constitution. "While 
the First Amendment confers on each citizen a powerful right to express 
oneself, it gives the picketer no boon to jeopardize the health, safety and 
rights of others," the state court said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aware Woman's Center is the lone abortion facility in a generally 
conservative area near the Kennedy Space Center, and it became a magnet for 
anti-abortion protesters last year. McGregor imposed his far-reaching order on 
April 8, a few weeks after an abortion doctor was fatally shot outside a clinic 
in Pensacola. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ruling, protesters could be fined as much as $500 if they came 
within 36 feet of the clinic. In addition, they were forbidden to accost 
patients or staff within 300 feet of the clinic to try to hand them 
anti-abortion literature or dissuade them from entering the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The court announced it would hear the case (Madsen vs. Women's Health Center, 
93-880) on the same day that an estimated 35,000 anti-abortion activists 
marched in front of the Supreme Court building in their annual protest of the 
Roe vs. Wade ruling guaranteeing a woman's right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court usually releases a list on Monday mornings of the appeals 
that will be given a court hearing and those that are dismissed without 
comment. But recently it has given lawyers a few extra days for preparation by 
announcing on Friday afternoons those cases that will be heard.

DAY-CARE CENTER OPERATOR GETS 7-YEAR PRISON TERM IN ABUSE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The woman who helped run the Little Rascals Day Care Center pleaded no contest 
Friday to 30 felony charges in a child-abuse case and was sentenced to seven 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors dropped 18 other charges that could have sent Elizabeth Kelly to 
prison for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Her pleas were mostly to charges of taking indecent liberties with children. 
She also pleaded no contest to one charge of a crime against nature, one charge 
of being an accessory after the fact to rape, and one charge of being an 
accessory after the fact to a sex offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly and her husband, Robert F. Kelly Jr., operated the child-care center in 
Edenton. It closed soon after her arrest in April, 1989. Elizabeth Kelly and 
five others were charged later. 
</P>
<P>
 She will get credit for the two years she served in jail before she was 
released on bond in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very much the innocent woman I was," she said Friday. "Although prison is 
someplace I don't want to return to, there are many worse prisons out here in 
the free world." 
</P>
<P>
 She entered her pleas during a hearing in which her lawyer asked that charges 
be dismissed because she had been awaiting trial for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband was sentenced to 12 life terms in 1992 after his conviction on 
charges that he sexually abused a dozen children. He is seeking a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Day-care center cook Dawn Wilson was convicted of sexual abuse last year and 
sentenced to life in prison. She is appealing the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other defendants face trials in the case.

WOMAN WHO WAS FROZEN TO FLOOR BEGINS RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From her brown eyes and toothless smile, you would never guess that 
91-year-old Victoria Moryn almost died from being frozen to the floor of her 
icy apartment four days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you saw my toes, you would know what I went through," the Polish widow 
said Friday through a translator as she continued to recover at St. Mary of 
Nazareth Hospital Center on the West Side. 
</P>
<P>
 Moryn is still in fair condition and may lose her toes, which are severely 
frostbitten and blue, doctors said. But she has not lost the capacity to 
appreciate the flowers, goodwill and many offers of help she has received since 
her ordeal became public. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is loving all this attention," said Barbara Schillon, a hospital social 
worker. "She never knew what it was to have someone care about her." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned neighbors and police found Moryn kneeling, barefoot, in an 
inch-thick layer of ice from leaking pipes Monday in the front room of her 
unheated home, a first-floor apartment in an otherwise vacant building. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature in Chicago was about 10 degrees at the time and had been below 
zero most of the weekend; no one is sure how long she had been stuck there. 
</P>
<P>
 Moryn had been heating her apartment with wood and coal in a potbelly stove, 
neighbors said. She was hospitalized in critical condition with frostbite, 
hypothermia and unstable blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, after hospital workers put a bow in her hair, she posed for 
pictures and was eager to know when they would be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "God bless you," she told the many visitors to her room. 
</P>
<P>
 Moryn's husband, who apparently was a factory worker, died in 1975, Schillon 
said.

RELIEF FROM COLD WAVE IS ON HORIZON, FORECASTERS SAY; WEATHER: EXPERTS SEE A 
WEEKEND 'THAW' OVER MUCH OF THE EAST AND MIDWEST. TEMPERATURES SHOULD CLIMB 
INTO THE 20S AND 30S, THEY PREDICT. 
</P>

<P>
 The mercury took a final dip below zero Friday before a weekend "thaw" that is 
expected to bring temperatures in the 20s and 30s and some relief to residents 
of the East and Midwest who have been numbed by the ice and cold. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could say we're suffering from a little cabin fever," said Mayor Patrick 
Loughney of Scranton, Pa., who has four children, ages 4 to 16. "There's only 
so much you can do. The videos are just going around and around." 
</P>
<P>
 The cold wave has been blamed for at least 130 deaths since last weekend. Many 
people died in icy road crashes, some suffered heart attacks while shoveling 
snow and others froze to death, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Icebreakers cruised the Hudson River on Friday, mail delivery was halted by 
frozen batteries in postal trucks, and water main breaks were a problem from 
Michigan to Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 With the mercury at about 8 degrees, a pre-dawn New York City water main break 
sent water gushing into the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, making the link between 
Brooklyn and Manhattan impassable. Workers got the flow down to a trickle about 
seven hours later by turning off valves. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of more than 60 flooded homes were forced into the streets. One 
street partially collapsed under the torrent, and some parked cars were swamped 
by water. As water settled on the streets, it began to freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cincinnati, work crews were repairing the 150 water mains that leaked or 
burst. Mandatory water restrictions were lifted in Atlanta after repairs to 
three mains that burst earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 National Weather Service officials said temperatures should shoot up by Monday 
-- to 40 degrees in some spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be very gradual," said meteorologist Bob Stalker in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasts called for temperatures in the Midwest and Northeast to reach the 
upper 20s today and the low 30s on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The coldest spots in the Lower 48 were in the Northeast and Midwest early 
Friday. It was 16 below in Albany, N.Y., and Indianapolis. It was 9 below in 
Pittsburgh, Pa., and 6 below in Portland, Me. Cleveland, Detroit and 
Louisville, Ky., also had sub-zero temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow and ice have closed schools, highways and airports in the past week. Some 
schools reopened Friday, but many remained closed. 
</P>
<P>
 About 362,000 nonessential federal employees in Washington were told to stay 
home Thursday. Federal offices reopened Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters blamed the cold weather on high pressure hanging over the western 
United States and Canada. Like a boulder in a stream, it has forced the 
eastbound jet stream from the Pacific to go around it by taking a detour up 
into Canada, picking up cold air before flowing down into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 On the frozen Hudson River, Coast Guard icebreakers rescued ice-bound barges 
Friday and tried to keep a small ice-free "highway" for boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Knee's houseboat, the Bullwinkle, has been icebound all week at a New 
York City marina. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday we set up a table on the ice and had coffee, and then we went 
roller-skating on the ice," he said. "Ice-skating would have been too easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Many others have had enough of the most numbing cold they have experienced in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last two days have been really testing my resolve," said Michael Savosky, 
a toll-taker at the Rip Van Winkle Bridge near Albany, N.Y. He said his hands 
were so chapped that his knuckles were bleeding.

TROOPERS TIED TO ALLEGATIONS ON CLINTON WON'T FACE PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There will be no criminal investigation of two Arkansas state troopers who 
last month alleged that they helped then-Gov. Bill Clinton conceal his 
extramarital affairs and that when he became President offered federal jobs to 
discourage them from speaking out. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas State Police Director Tommy L. Goodwin said reports of such an 
investigation published Jan. 13 by the Associated Press and the Arkansas 
Democrat-Gazette newspaper were erroneous. The AP account also appeared in The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Those published reports said that Goodwin ordered an inquiry into alleged 
insurance fraud claims made against troopers Roger Perry and Larry Patterson by 
Roy Gene Sanders, an attorney for Columbia Mutual Insurance Co.  
</P>
<P>
 In comments published Friday in the Democrat-Gazette, Goodwin said the stories 
about a criminal probe were the result of "a misunderstanding somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry suffered a broken neck as a passenger in a state police car driven by 
Patterson three years ago. Patterson, who crashed into a tree on a foggy night, 
did not inform his superiors that the two had stopped for drinks before the 
accident. Patterson passed a sobriety test and was not cited for driving while 
under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson's insurance company, Columbia, refused to pay Perry's medical bills, 
causing Perry to sue for compensation. Sanders, as part of his defense 
strategy, accused the troopers of conspiring to cheat his client. The troopers 
deny the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the grounds are, if any, for an investigation," Goodwin 
told the Democrat-Gazette. He did not return calls from The Times on Friday.

COLORADO UNIVERSITY REGENTS VOTE TO KEEP EMBATTLED PRESIDENT

<P>
 University of Colorado President Judith Albino survived an ouster attempt by 
members of the faculty and administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Regents voted 5-4 late Thursday to keep Albino, but will examine 
the issue again this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, all eight deans and 70 faculty members signed a petition asking 
Albino to resign. Among other things, they said she was an ineffective leader 
who did not consult the faculty and students before making decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Albino, 50, recently persuaded the regents to abolish paid leave for 
administrators.

TERRY FRIEDMAN TO RETIRE FROM LEGISLATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) will retire from the state 
Legislature at the end of his current term, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, whose 41st District runs from Santa Monica to Agoura Hills, is 
telling supporters he wants to become a Los Angeles County Superior Court 
judge.He is expected to seek the seat of Superior Court Judge Barnet M. 
Cooperman, who is retiring. That seat will be on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 An announcement is expected on Monday. Friedman could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Political consultant Joseph Cerrell, who is frequently hired by judges to run 
their campaigns, said late Friday that Friedman is consulting with family, 
supporters and political allies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's looking at it very seriously this weekend," Cerrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, 44, was elected to the Assembly in 1986 in the 43rd District in West 
Los Angeles, replacing State Controller Gray Davis. He was elected in 1992 in 
the newly drawn 41st District in a race against former Santa Monica Mayor 
Christine Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under term limits set by voters, he could have run for one more term before 
retiring from the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) suggested that term limits could have 
been a factor in Friedman's apparent decision to change careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not going to pass up opportunities when they're barred from 
running again for office," Berman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Reed, who portrayed Friedman as weak on crime issues during the last election, 
had a different take. "More's the pity for the criminal justice system," Reed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Friedman is known for his pursuit of anti-smoking legislation. 
He also carried legislation to prohibit discrimination against gays and 
lesbians.

<P>
 A Malaysian bus driver was fired after he refused to cut his nearly six-inch 
fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysia's road department told Jaafar Nordin that the fingernails not only 
look bad but could hinder his driving. When Nordin refused to cut them, the 
department revoked his driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Nordin cut his hair and nails was five years ago, when he 
accepted a friend's challenge to let them grow until he gets married, which 
will be at the end of this year.

CORONA OFFICIALS SUE TO HALT MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corona city officials filed suit Friday in a last-minute effort to thwart 
aerial spraying of the insecticide malathion over their community, slated to 
begin Monday evening as part of the state's effort to eradicate the 
crop-ravaging Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in Riverside Superior Court, asks for a temporary 
restraining order in order that more lengthy arguments can be made in the 
city's effort to permanently enjoin the state from spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing was set for Monday afternoon -- just hours before the scheduled 9 
p.m. start of the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, the city contends that the state failed to abide by its own 
environmental regulations by not considering the public health affects of 
spraying malathion over 18 square miles of Corona and neighboring Norco. 
</P>
<P>
 The state is using "the residents of Corona as human guinea pigs in order to 
collect data on the long-term effects of malathion spraying on individuals," 
the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spraying is part of California's massive Medfly eradication effort. In San 
Bernardino, Orange and Los Angeles counties, sterile Medflies will be released 
to combat the insect. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial spraying of malathion was proposed for Corona after the discovery of a 
sole Mediterranean fruit fly was discovered in the city last month. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials have said the aerial spraying is necessary because there are 
no spare sterile Medflies to use in the Riverside County infestation area. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they fear that if the region is not rid of Medflies, the state's 
agricultural industry will be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona officials argue that instead of spraying, the state should divert a 
fraction of the billions of sterile Medflies that are being used to battle the 
problem elsewhere.

ARMY OF COUNSELORS HELP DOCTORS, NURSES COPE; STRESS: BATTLE-WEARY HEALTH 
WORKERS NEED WAYS TO RELIEVE THEIR OWN QUAKE ANXIETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf had been a psychiatrist, he might have been like 
Dr. Stephen E. Salenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in army fatigues and black combat boots, the husky, bearded Salenger 
prowls the halls of Northridge Hospital Medical Center, pausing to talk with 
haggard-looking doctors and nurses, offering them words of solace and 
encouragement as if they were battle-weary soldiers headed back to the front 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Which, in a sense, they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Monday's shattering earthquake, Los Angeles hospitals have treated and 
released 6,547 injured people. Another 1,292 were admitted with serious 
injuries, and many of them are in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 That huge influx of patients, combined with the frustration of broken 
equipment and the tension of 14-hour days, has left many hospital workers 
exhausted to the point of burnout. 
</P>
<P>
 At several hospitals, psychiatric counselors have swung into action, advising 
staffers on how to cope with the stresses of caring for hordes of injured 
people as they struggle to clean up their own homes and reassure frazzled 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kaiser Permanente in Panorama City, a counselor met with employees of the 
optometry department to discuss their emotions after their popular department 
head, Burton Krell, was killed in an auto accident while heading for the 
hospital shortly after the quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on the Westside, a psychiatrist sent one 
employee home after she expressed terror that she would be swallowed by ground 
softened because of repeated aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Just minutes into a quake-stress meeting at the Northridge hospital, located 
virtually atop the quake's epicenter, a middle-aged nurse stood and walked 
swiftly from the room. Returning later, she said she had thrown up -- a 
reaction to days of trying to suppress fear of the quake and its aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been acting braver than I really am," she said. "Suddenly just now I 
felt this awful nausea. I thought I was doing quite well until that point." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same meeting, a young emergency room technician expressed shame over 
not rushing to the hospital right after the quake; a top executive said he was 
angry at political "looky-loos" -- including Gayle Wilson, Gov. Pete Wilson's 
wife -- for appearing at the overloaded hospital for photo-opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge officials acknowledge that day after day of 12- and 14-hour shifts 
-- combined with worries about quake-damaged homes and anxious spouses and 
children -- are wearing down staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a massive amount of psychic trauma around here -- it's not letting up," 
said Dr. Paul Karis, who supervises the emergency room staff at Northridge, 
which has treated more than 600 quake victims since Monday. "The staff is just 
running out of steam." 
</P>
<P>
 Karis told of approaching another Northridge doctor a couple of days after the 
quake to ask how he was holding up. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor erupted into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the first person you see in the morning . . . and he says he has several 
patients with chest pains, one with a heart attack. His house is basically 
condemned, he hasn't slept more than six hours in the past three days," Karis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His wife is coming apart, his kids won't stop crying. His brick wall fell 
down, and the dogs ran away." 
</P>
<P>
 Some hospitals also have set up day-care centers for employees whose regular 
day-care arrangements were canceled or who simply cannot bear to be separated 
from their children at the moment -- or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 To help stressed-out staffers at Northridge, Salenger, the psychiatrist, and 
three dozen other doctors, nurses and emergency workers were brought in under a 
little-known federal program, the National Disaster Medical System, which 
dispatches teams of medical workers to backup local ones that are overwhelmed 
during major disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Salenger's team, which also responded in Hawaii after Hurricane Iniki, wears 
distinctive blue jumpsuits or military fatigues; many members also wear combat 
boots. Most of them work at hospitals and fire departments in San Bernardino 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Striding the corridors at Northridge in his camouflage combat outfit, 
Salenger, chief of staff at Patton State Hospital, a psychiatric facility in 
San Bernardino, sought to reassure anxiety-ridden staffers that their reactions 
were nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not psychological problems," he said. "This is not mental illness. 
These are normal reactions to abnormal situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Salenger described their problems as "critical incident stress," saying the 
best treatment is simply to give workers a chance to vent their feelings and 
fears -- while on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Although temporary, the stress can develop, if untreated, into far more 
serious post-traumatic stress disorder, a mental disturbance suffered by some 
Vietnam War veterans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Geoffrey Newstadt, head of emergency psychiatry at Cedars-Sinai, said his 
unit has counseled a number of staffers "in crisis" as a result of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't hear a lot of people on Monday and Tuesday say, 'I'm scared,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard a lot of people say that today," he said earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Newstadt added that many staffers also tell of bizarre and frightening dreams, 
probably set off by the quake. Others complain of sleeplessness related to the 
aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing quite so unnerving as the earth moving and buildings falling 
down," he said.

MORE QUAKE VICTIMS SEEK AID; SIMI VALLEY RESIDENTS REGAIN WATER SERVICE; 
RECOVERY: ABOUT 3,400 VENTURA COUNTY PEOPLE HAVE SOUGHT GOVERNMENT HELP. RAIN 
IS EXPECTED SUNDAY, WHICH WOULD FORCE THOUSANDS FROM PARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the slow, frustrating process of earthquake recovery continued Friday, 
water service was restored to beleaguered Simi Valley and the number of Ventura 
County disaster victims seeking government aid rose to about 3,400. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's principal water supplier also began to replenish its supplies of 
imported water for the first time since Monday's earthquake after patching 
breaks in giant lines from the San Fernando Valley, the quake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the people can take a shower again," said Mike Sedell, assistant city 
manager in Simi Valley after service to 5,000 homes and businesses was 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
 A new round of aftershocks as strong as magnitude 4.6 also rolled through 
Southern California on Friday, as the region braced for a Sunday rainstorm that 
would force 14,500 displaced people out of parks where they have stayed all 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 If hundreds of Ventura County residents remain camped in their yards Saturday 
night rather than re-enter their quake-damaged homes or find other 
accommodations, they could also end up wet by Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still pretty jumpy," Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said. "It 
doesn't take much of an aftershock to see that their adrenaline goes up. It's 
hard to return to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Regional transportation officials announced that Metrolink commuter rail 
service to downtown Los Angeles will be extended west to Camarillo next month. 
A county proposal to extend the run to Oxnard and Ventura is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jobless claims at the Simi Valley unemployment office nearly doubled to 800 
this week as businesses closed by the earthquake began laying off workers. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county's top prosecutor asked the Board of Supervisors and officials in 
10 local cities to enact laws prohibiting price gouging during emergencies. 
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said his office had received numerous 
complaints of huge price hikes for water, milk, bread, gasoline and plumbing 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros made good on his 
promise to deliver $738,000 in federal community development grants to Simi 
Valley. City officials said the money will provide shelter for quake victims 
and help repair city buildings, including City Hall, the police station and 
senior center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Owners of dozens of shattered stores in historic downtown Fillmore brought 
architects and engineers to their shops to decide whether it is worthwhile to 
rebuild. At least two -- owners of the Masonic Building and the Fillmore 
Theater -- immediately decided that it was not. 
</P>
<P>
 * The American Red Cross announced that it will open two emergency centers in 
Simi Valley and Fillmore this morning to provide counseling and emergency 
financial aid to quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 600 people remained in emergency shelters in Fillmore and Simi Valley 
Thursday night, and the American Red Cross expects the numbers to increase 
through the weekend with cooler weather and rain. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caltrans officials announced that follow-up inspections on all bridges and 
freeway overpasses countywide showed them to be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite looting at two Simi Valley schools, reported crime has remained 
below normal throughout the county since Monday's disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 * Simi Valley City Manager Lin Koester waived fees for building permits and 
safety plan checks for repairs to quake-damaged buildings. The City Council is 
scheduled to confirm the emergency order Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The promise of loans and grants for emergency housing and reconstruction 
created long lines for the second consecutive day at the newly opened Simi 
Valley disaster aid center. Far fewer victims showed up in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 The snafus, fights and shouting matches that marked disaster aid efforts at 
the region's 12 assistance centers outside the county were not obvious in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 600 applications had been processed by late Friday in this county. 
But about 2,800 earthquake victims left the centers here with only appointments 
to come back again -- and some not until Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 And one Simi Valley applicant was furious that President Clinton's promises of 
immediate aid had not translated into a rental voucher or quick placement in 
hotel or apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not immediate," fumed Addie Inzalaco, 53, who is staying with a 
daughter in Simi Valley because the mother's Northridge home was destroyed. 
Inspectors will be unable to verify her claim for 10 days, she was told. 
</P>
<P>
 But many other applicants accepted the delays without complaint. Especially 
those seeking long-term loans said they understood that claims must be 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've really been helpful," said Barbara Shrode, 52, who applied for a loan 
to rebuild block walls around her Simi Valley home. "You have to have proof (of 
damage). Anyone could say they lost their house." 
</P>
<P>
 In a policy shift late Friday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
announced that operating hours at application centers would be increased by 
three hours a day. Those centers now will be open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., seven 
days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 While efforts to aid earthquake victims moved forward, several local officials 
said Friday that inspectors are finding that many buildings with visible damage 
are structurally sound and can be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, officials said early estimates of $1 billion in damage countywide 
may still be accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary surveys have found about 6,000 dwellings damaged countywide, 
including about 1,000 that have been declared uninhabitable at least 
temporarily. About 130 businesses, including 72 in Simi Valley and 50 in 
Fillmore, have been declared seriously damaged or of questionable safety after 
follow-up examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore officials on Friday increased their total of moderate or severely 
damaged buildings from 413 to 509, as a dozen inspectors nearly completed 
detailed examination of the small city's battered central district and aging 
east side. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are our totals out of the older areas," said Dave Lussier, who is 
coordinating the inspection teams. "These were the tough ones. We should blow 
through the others and be done by tomorrow night." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, where three-fourths of the city has not yet been inspected, 
officials have found 500 to 600 uninhabitable mobile homes, 66 other houses 
with moderate to extensive damage, and 72 commercial and industrial buildings 
damaged enough to limit entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedell said inspections so far are not the best indication of damage in Simi 
Valley. Better indicators are that 3,000 residents and business owners whose 
reports of serious damage have not yet been checked, and the thousands of 
people who have gone to the city's disaster aid center for help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those two things are better indicators than anything the government can come 
up with in numbers," he said. "If you want to look at the human toll, that's 
the way to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake's toll in human discomfort diminished substantially Friday when 
a 78-inch main line from the San Fernando Valley finally held water and 5,000 
customers in eastern Simi Valley could again count on a steady supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days of around-the-clock repairs by crews from Calleguas Municipal Water 
District, the Southern California Water Co. and the city also repaired Ventura 
County's second main water supply line. 
</P>
<P>
 That line began pumping water into Bard Lake, the east county's principal 
drinking water reservoir, late Friday. The lake usually gives Calleguas' 
500,000 Ventura County customers, in cities as far west as Oxnard, a two-week 
reserve supply. 
</P>
<P>
 But its level had dropped by 25% this week, despite conservation efforts in 
Thousand Oaks and Camarillo plus Oxnard pumping its water exclusively from its 
own underground reserves, Calleguas planning administrator Eric Bergh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to continue to stress conservation until we are sure our system is 
stabilized," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley residents should continue to boil water for drinking and cooking 
for several days because of residual impurities in the lines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another move to make the post-quake lives of county residents more 
comfortable, the regional rail transportation authority Friday approved a 
Ventura County Transportation Commission request to extend daily commuter 
service to Camarillo. That will allow commuters to avoid the Los Angeles County 
freeways where traffic backups are expected for months as freeways are 
reconstructed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginger Gherardi, commission executive director, said the new station will open 
in February. County officials also are hoping to use additional federal 
earthquake relief money to open Metrolink stations in Oxnard and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "The station in Camarillo is part of our definite plan," Gherardi said. 
"Beyond that I really can't say what we'll be able to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning at 9 a.m. today, the county chapter of the American Red Cross 
expects to open two service centers that will offer emergency aid vouchers to 
pay for groceries, medicine, new clothing, emergency home repairs, tools or 
other household items, said Brian Bolton, executive director of the Ventura 
County chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Service center hours are 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day, Bolton said. The centers 
are located at the Sycamore Drive Community Center, 1692 Sycamore Drive, in 
Simi Valley, and at the Fillmore Senior Center, 533 Santa Clara St. 
</P>
<P>
 "We receive no government funding for this," Bolton said. "It is all donated 
dollars. We are here to assure that no one falls through the cracks."

WEARY QUAKE VICTIMS TIED UP IN RED TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL and RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of bone-weary earthquake victims, whose hopes lifted when Clinton 
Administration officials arrived promising quick delivery of emergency housing 
vouchers, were bitterly disappointed Friday to find that it could be days -- 
even weeks -- before housing or other forms of emergency aid will be provided 
by disaster centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Government leaders struggled to cut through a thicket of bureaucratic delays 
and unravel a potentially embarrassing recovery snafu. By day's end, there were 
signs of progress as hastily accelerated paperwork processing resulted in a few 
lucky quake victims receiving certificates that guarantee them help in paying 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight hours in line, Felicia Jefferson was the first to receive a 
housing certificate from the Van Nuys disaster relief center, which promises to 
pay 70% of her $900 rent for the next 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working and paying taxes for 18 years now," said the mother of twin 
toddlers. "I've never been in a situation where I needed to ask for help, but I 
really need it now so I'm not embarrassed or tucking my head or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the 12 disaster assistance centers were overwhelmed by the 
enormity of the relief need. In many cases, emotions flared as victims learned 
that they may have to wait until next month for an appointment to apply for 
housing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The realization that the nightmare of camping out in cars, parks and emergency 
shelters was not over was underscored by a massive push by authorities to erect 
huge tent cities and coax the homeless into barracks-style Red Cross shelters 
before the expected weekend arrival of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand. . . . They are supposed to have emergency services," said 
mail carrier Phillip Denton, who trekked to the Crenshaw Disaster Assistance 
Center on Friday after his apartment building was condemned -- only to be told 
to come back next week. "We work hard for a living and pay taxes. We shouldn't 
have to go through this." 
</P>
<P>
 Leora Garland, 27, a secretary forced out of the same apartment building, 
said: "We need a home. I can understand there is a lot of red tape . . . so 
many people are without homes. But don't come out here and say that you don't 
have nothing (for anyone)." 
</P>
<P>
 The anger was particularly acute because Clinton Administration officials, 
including Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt, had 
stressed that the aid response would be swift -- unlike the much-criticized 
handling of victims of Hurricane Andrew and other disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials had announced that for the first time, housing vouchers 
allowing low-income quake victims to quickly rent replacement apartments would 
be distributed at disaster centers. "People can take that voucher and get 
housing tomorrow," Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros 
said Wednesday, fueling the high expectations.  
</P>
<P>
 What was not made clear until victims swamped the centers late Thursday and 
Friday was the small number of people who could be processed. Only about 100 
applications were handled at some centers Friday, and future appointments were 
quickly booked through early February. As a result, thousands seeking aid were 
turned away Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a larger housing emergency anywhere," Cisneros said in an 
interview with Times editors and reporters. "It's stunning to see the extent of 
the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm guilty somewhat of raising expectations by talking about it," he 
acknowledged. "There are people who believe they can walk in and get a voucher 
and walk out and get a house." 
</P>
<P>
 The reality, he said, is that to safeguard public funds, officials must be 
assured that emergency aid goes only to quake victims, not the thousands of 
otherwise needy families in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 This requirement led to infuriating delays Friday morning at aid centers 
throughout Los Angeles, as those seeking help were asked to prove that their 
homes were rendered unlivable by the quake. Recognizing the severity of the 
problem, HUD officials moved to streamline the process in the afternoon, 
permitting some victims to begin hunting for new homes immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with the volume of claims, Witt also pledged to open as many as six 
additional relief centers by early next week in Calabasas, Culver City and San 
Fernando and on the Westside. Officials said 2,000 more state and federal 
workers were en route to staff the network of centers.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, some elected officials, inundated by constituent complaints, criticized 
the early phases of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information given out was not accurate and it gave people unrealistic 
expectations," said San Fernando Valley council member Laura Chick, who had to 
calm a woman who became hysterical at a relief center after learning she would 
have to wait days for emergency housing. "She had two children and an (ill) 
83-year-old mother," Chick said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a tense and tired crowd gathered outside the Winnetka Recreation Center, 
one of the busiest of the 12 disaster relief facilities, Los Angeles police 
officers tried to keep the peace and answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what's going to happen to us today?" one man asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, you are going to be patient, just like you have been," an officer said 
gently, his hand on the man's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and local officials, including Cisneros and Mayor Richard Riordan, 
huddled in a series of meetings throughout the day, trying to resolve the 
problems. The city hustled lists of damaged buildings to the FEMA centers to 
help workers confirm the eligibility of those seeking aid. But incomplete data 
and computer glitches at the city's Department of Building and Safety were 
complicating the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 While FEMA officials did distribute some emergency food stamps and issue a 
number of cash grants for housing, much of Friday's work at the centers 
appeared to be limited to pushing forms. 
</P>
<P>
 One official with the California Department of Social Services, despairing at 
the pace in the centers, observed tartly: "The only thing (the disaster 
centers) did today was create one long paper trail. All we did was take 
applications." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the confusion was uncertainty about what aid was available, and for 
whom. FEMA directly administers two types of disaster grants. Regardless of 
their income, people whose homes are unsafe can obtain a flat sum of emergency 
money, based on family size and average rents in the area, to help pay for a 
place to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA also will pay the mortgages or rents of people who are in danger of 
losing their homes because their jobs were wiped out by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "People out there are scared we're going to run out of money . . . that if 
they're not of there first, they won't get help," Witt said. "That's not true." 
</P>
<P>
 But Linda Hooker, who has spent five days in a tent in Granada Hills with her 
two children, is losing patience. As she stood in a long line of people at the 
Van Nuys disaster center, she refused to accept the obvious -- she would not be 
getting help finding a new home anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know what they are offering. . . . From what I'm hearing, they 
are just giving out appointments. I don't know if I can wait."

 After freeways tumbled in Monday's pre-dawn shaker, Baskin-Robbins faced havoc 
in getting people to work on time -- or at all. So the ice cream chain is 
letting many of the 150 staffers at its headquarters in Glendale set their own 
hours to make it easier to get in. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Saenger, a management consultant who has always called on his clients in 
person, reluctantly plans to try working from his rustic Canyon Country home a 
few days a month. "That's the reality now," Saenger said. "It's going to have 
to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 With several major freeways disrupted and many offices severely damaged, 
Southern Californians and their employers are changing the way they work. More 
employees are working out of their homes, paving electronic highways with 
personal computers, modems and fax machines. Others, with their bosses' 
blessings, are juggling work schedules and chucking rigid workplace policies. 
</P>
<P>
 In post-quake Los Angeles, it is definitely not business as usual. And, some 
workplace experts and government officials say, surprise benefits might emerge 
from all the disruption. As destructive and terrifying as it was, the 
earthquake has provided sprawling, vehicle-fixated Southern California with a 
rare opportunity to reshape how, where and when its residents do their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise quake-triggered fixes now could ease smog, traffic snarls and the general 
stresses of life for years to come, experts say, even after roads and offices 
have been rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 But will Los Angeles seize this opportunity? Will the jolting Northridge 
temblor shake up work habits forever, or simply result in Band-Aid measures 
that will fade once the immediate crisis has passed? 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bay Area, still suffering disruptions four years after the 
7.1-magnitude Loma Prieta temblor, can be a guide, chances are good that there 
will be dramatic shifts now and subtle, yet profound, changes in the longer 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Loma Prieta quake, some companies expanded programs to 
encourage telecommuting, flexible hours and car-pooling. Given the even greater 
destruction here, Southern Californians can look forward to similar changes, 
experts say. Companies Respond 
</P>
<P>
 For now, local and state officials are working with Pacific Bell, GTE 
California, telecommunications experts and big employers to craft a major 
telecommuting initiative and related workplace changes. They want to encourage 
more workers to telecommute from home or from "telecenters" -- offices equipped 
with computers, faxes and phones -- close to their homes. Officials said plans 
still are being drafted, but some details are scheduled to be announced today. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, though, calls from employers interested in office space for 
telecommuters are pouring into the Antelope Valley Telebusiness Center, a 
year-old, county-run facility that is considered one of the most successful 
facilities of its type. That's quite a change from the initial response: Until 
this week, only about 15 of the 20 workstations available to telecommuters were 
being used. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, things are changing. "We obviously have a year to several years 
ahead of us in dealing with the earthquake, and we've got to come up with 
creative and non-traditional solutions," said Susan Herman, top 
telecommunications official for the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce de Terra, a state transportation planner, said: "This will allow people 
and their employers, who are skeptical, to sample the changes. Eventually, what 
you will see are permanent changes in the way people conduct business." Habits 
Die Hard 
</P>
<P>
 But before those shifts come about, workers can expect plenty of tension 
between new realities and long-entrenched traditions dictating how -- and where 
-- employees do their work. While bosses still want face-to-face contact with 
their employees, they'll have to adjust to the changes brought on by new 
traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fascinating test case of the whole notion of flexibility," said 
workplace consultant Charles Rodgers, with Work/Family Directions in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some experts say Angelenos will return to their old driving habits 
once the freeways are repaired, others contend that the roadways will be out of 
commission long enough for many to learn to love such options as telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend is toward telecommuting, and an earthquake can't help but move that 
along," said Joanne H. Pratt, a Dallas-based management consultant who focuses 
on using technology to enhance productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 For some employees, telecommuting can be as simple as having a pad of paper 
and a telephone. Others require sophisticated workstations, with PCs, modems, 
faxes and phones. Cellular phones and new hand-held devices that can send and 
receive information make desks obsolete and have given rise to a new term -- 
virtual office -- to describe the mobile workplace of those on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many experts lobby for telecommuting and flexible work schedules, few 
employees have tried them when given the chance. That is true even among 
working parents who say they need flexible schedules to handle family demands. 
A survey released last year by Work/Family Directions, focusing on 80 big U.S. 
companies that offer such options, found fewer than 2% of employees used the 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is economic, Rodgers said. People fear that if they adopt a 
flexible work schedule, "they'll be written off" by their bosses, losing out on 
raises, promotions or maybe even their jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he predicted that, even after the freeways are repaired, workers who found 
unexpected benefits in telecommuting or staggered work hours will stick with 
them. Higher Productivity 
</P>
<P>
 Like other workplace specialists, he said productivity normally skyrockets 
when workers try telecommuting or so-called compressed workweeks, working 40 
hours over four days or 80 hours over nine days. Telecommuters often find there 
are fewer distractions at home, and workers taking advantage of flexible work 
situations are less likely to quit or take time off because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Some major employers, including several big Hollywood studios, began talking 
to government agencies this week about making greater use of telecommuting. 
Woodland Hills-based Health Net, the state's second-biggest health maintenance 
organization, is lining up telecenters for employees in Valencia and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is no guarantee that the changes will last. "It's a little too 
soon to know the future," said Rita Duarte, the HMO's executive vice president. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, experts say, it's difficult to promote such services to corporate 
and government employers. "We can't seem to get middle managers to understand 
that you are going to benefit from these programs," said Nancy Apeles Eiser, 
transportation program manager for Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "But once you get over that hump, there is no stopping them," she added. "They 
see all the reasons why it makes good business sense and that they should have 
been doing it all along." 
</P>
<P>
 Eiser figures it's a matter of time. "Now that the need is really there, given 
the earthquake situation, it seems like the natural thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In the quake's aftermath, government officials have called for measures such 
as compressed workweeks to ease traffic problems. The Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors, for example, passed a motion Tuesday calling for county 
department heads to encourage workers, when possible, to telecommute from homes 
or outlying offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many workers in recession-weakened Southern California, fearful of the 
possibility of layoffs, are worried about trying telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some employees fear the 'out of sight, out of mind' phenomenon," said Paula 
Ramsey, a regional manager for Commuter Transportation Services, a Los Angeles 
nonprofit group that offers a car-pooling service and advises employers on 
traffic-reduction programs. "They tell themselves, 'I know I can produce the 
work I've been assigned if they let me work at home, but in this economy I want 
to be in the office at all times. When you're not in the office, anything can 
happen, you can even be fired.' " Matter of Survival 
</P>
<P>
 When the earthquake struck south of San Francisco on Oct. 17, 1989, 
flexibility became a matter of survival for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor knocked out a section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, 
destroyed or damaged freeways feeding into downtown San Francisco, collapsed a 
double-decker viaduct in Oakland and caused massive rock slides on a winding 
stretch of mountain road from Santa Cruz into Silicon Valley. The region's 
crisscross commuting patterns were thoroughly disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Many big employers -- notably Hewlett-Packard, Bechtel, Pacific Bell, Chevron, 
Pacific Gas & Electric and Bank of America -- instituted transit subsidies, 
moved to more flexible scheduling or encouraged telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit agencies leaped into action, adding ferry service from Oakland and 
Alameda to San Francisco, beefing up service on BART, starting a bus route over 
the Santa Cruz Mountains and expanding car-pooling services. Overnight, there 
was a dramatic shift to public transit, and ride-sharing programs nearly 
doubled.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though highway traffic is nearly back to pre-quake levels, BART has shown 
an impressive gain of more than 20% in ridership over pre-quake levels, and 
some companies did make fundamental changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bechtel Inc., a San Francisco engineering firm with traditional 8-to-5 values, 
allowed employees to stagger their start and stop times immediately after the 
quake. When key bridges and roads returned to service and the company tried to 
go back to its old ways, an outcry from employees prompted a rethinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized it seemed to be working," said Tim Green, manager of employee 
relations in San Francisco. "It helped people with child care and commuting." 
Staggered scheduling became policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies said the quake had no long-term effect. A spokesman at Bank of 
America, which had developed a flextime policy before the 1989 quake, said the 
earthquake did not cause a "permanent uptick" in people taking advantage of the 
option. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack M. Nilles, a Brentwood-based consultant who says he coined the term 
telecommute in 1973 while he was stuck in freeway gridlock, views working from 
home or satellite offices as a business imperative in post-quake Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he noted that at some companies it might take years to adopt 
permanent changes "because it requires cultural change and, unlike an 
earthquake, that doesn't happen instantaneously." 
</P>
<P>
 Absent a disaster like an earthquake, what generally motivates businesses to 
try telecommuting is the profit motive. It reduces the need for costly office 
space and increases productivity. By Nilles' calculation, employers save an 
average of $8,000 a year for each mid-level employee who telecommutes 
regularly. Easing Traffic 
</P>
<P>
 Nilles estimates that easily half the work force in Los Angeles could 
telecommute at least twice a month, easing traffic congestion dramatically. 
During the 1984 Olympics, which brought an estimated 2 million visitors to Los 
Angeles, the city's streets remained unclogged even though car-pooling and 
other efforts reduced traffic by just 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive recruiter Gary Kaplan, who owns a Pasadena firm with eight 
employees, said he is open to having his employees do more telephone work from 
home, although he admits to having reservations about how productive people are 
if they "aren't under your thumb." 
</P>
<P>
 He also is looking into renting a furnished apartment near the office and 
letting employees take turns using it during the workweek. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come upon a time where we have to stay loose," Kaplan said. "It might 
not be possible to continue operating the way we've been operating."

COUNCIL TO FUND HOUSING LOANS WITH HUD GRANT; AFTERMATH: IN STOPGAP MEASURE, 
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO DISPLACED TENANTS AND 
OWNERS OF DAMAGED PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With thousands of people displaced from their homes and apartments, the Los 
Angeles City Council voted unanimously Friday to spend tens of millions of 
dollars in federal housing funds to make emergency low-interest loans to 
displaced tenants and residential property owners who have suffered earthquake 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants who apply for federal help at disaster assistance centers will be 
given $500 vouchers immediately -- and up to $2,000 for first and last month's 
rent and security deposits -- which they will have to repay to the city when 
their federal assistance checks are issued. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said landlord associations have indicated that their members 
will accept the vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing rehabilitation loans, normally available only to property owners 
with low and moderate incomes, would extend for two years and be available to 
owners of houses or apartments in the city regardless of their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners would qualify as long as the total encumbrances on their property -- 
including the value of the new loan -- did not exceed the property's appraised 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest would accumulate at 5%, but no principal or interest payments would 
be due until the two-year period is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a responsibility to be rather aggressive to get funds into the hands 
of people who have been disadvantaged by earthquake damage," said City 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who introduced the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant General Manager Barbara Zeidman of the Los Angeles Housing 
Department said the city probably will fund the rehabilitation loans with at 
least $25 million to $30 million of an advance on its $109-million federal 
Housing and Urban Development grant for next year. Conceivably, she said, the 
council could authorize use of almost the entire HUD grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeidman anticipates the city spending another $2.5 million in federal money on 
emergency assistance to renters displaced by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Money would go only to renters who had applied to the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency or the Small Business Administration for assistance and were 
waiting for it to come through. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeidman said experience with past disasters shows that it takes about three 
weeks for FEMA to begin efficiently processing applications for help. When FEMA 
is fully up and running, she said, the agency should be able to offer an 
applicant a check within three to five days. 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding to provide rental assistance to displaced tenants applying for 
FEMA help, Zeidman said, "we were after a product that will fill a three-week 
gap." 
</P>
<P>
 Housing rehabilitation loans were also aimed at filling a gap, officials said. 
They will have to be paid off or refinanced after two years, said city Housing 
Department Administration Director Matthew Callahan. If a loan recipient has a 
high income and wants to extend the loan, he or she would be asked to pay the 
going interest rates. Low-income recipients might only be required to repay the 
principal of the loan upon selling the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeidman said the city will be able to complete property appraisals and fund 
the loans within 10 days, while federal agencies are expected to take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in the loans -- which are available regardless of the amount 
of damage incurred -- can find out about them at disaster assistance centers or 
by calling the Housing Department at (800) 946-4444. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the use of its federal funds after receiving pledges from 
HUD officials that they would advance next year's grant soon and eventually ask 
Congress to reimburse Los Angeles for money spent on earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The city ordinarily uses its HUD money for a variety of community-development 
projects, including job training, low-income housing construction and, last 
year, $16 million in housing rehabilitation loans to low- and moderate-income 
property owners or owners in blighted areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In another matter affecting tenants, the City Council temporarily tightened 
eviction regulations in the wake of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Evictions will not be allowed during the next 45 days because an apartment is 
overcrowded or a property owner discovers that it has been sublet without his 
or her knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Evictions would still be permitted for failure to pay rent, but Councilwoman 
Jackie Goldberg, who made the motion to forestall them, asked the Housing 
Department to request that landlords show forbearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with mountains of debris from the earthquakes, Mayor Richard Riordan and 
the City Council also gave emergency approval Friday to putting private 
garbage-collection companies on the streets today to assist city workers in the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner had the plan been announced, however, than it stirred concern among 
city labor leaders, who have worried about Riordan's attempts to privatize 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to be paranoid, but it's hard not to be," said Julie Butcher, a 
representative of the union Service Employees International Union Local 347, 
that represents city trash collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to stand in the way of getting people's debris picked up, but 
in terms of residential refuse, we're right on top of it," Butcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Dickerson, president of the Board of Public Works, said city officials 
are extremely sensitive to the fears of city workers. But he insisted that the 
200 or so private contractors to be brought in will not pick up residential 
refuse. That will remain the duty of city workers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city administrative office said the Board of Public Works' 
bureau of engineering will launch a program to demolish unsafe buildings at no 
cost to owners who are uninsured.

TO REBUILD OR NOT: TOUGH DECISIONS FOR PROPERTY OWNERS; DAMAGE: AS THE BUILDING 
INSPECTORS COMB SHATTERED NEIGHBORHOODS, VICTIMS ARE FORCED TO CHOOSE HOW THEY 
WILL DEAL WITH THE FINANCIAL AFTERMATH.

<P>
 With more than 1,100 buildings declared uninhabitable, property owners across 
Los Angeles began to make wrenching decisions Friday about whether to rebuild 
earthquake battered houses, apartments and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 A Northridge landlord said he might declare bankruptcy and demolish two 
apartment buildings, rather than try to rebuild with no insurance, problematic 
financing and slumping real estate values. In Westwood, the owner of one half 
of a commercial strip decided to rebuild and make a go of it, while the owner 
of the other half planned to apply for a demolition permit. And a South-Central 
Los Angeles apartment owner was already lining up for a building permit. 
</P>
<P>
 As owners made their assessments, an expanded force of more than 600 
inspectors continued to survey the damage. Officials said they might have to 
check as many as 25,000 buildings for safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a fifth of that number had been inspected by the end of the week, and 
city building and safety officials said they were prepared to work 12-hour 
shifts through the weekend in hopes of completing their task by the end of next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary report showed Friday that 1,175 structures are uninhabitable, 
including more than 4,800 housing units. With little more than half of the 
5,000 building assessments by city building inspectors tabulated, damage 
reached $373.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Owners are expected to take the initiative to repair their buildings once they 
have been tagged with with red "unsafe" or yellow "limited entry" placards. 
They must hire engineers or architects to submit plans to the city for all but 
the most cosmetic repairs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of Friday only a handful of owners had applied to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they have plans to expeditiously handle the applications when 
they come in. Under an ordinance to be weighed by the City Council next week, 
earthquake repair applications would be moved ahead of all others within the 
city bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There'll be a lot of vacant lots unless there's some sort of federal tax 
relief or some other loopholes to get through," said David Harper, a principal 
in two Northridge garden apartments, one condemned and the other extensively 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper said he would probably need a second mortgage to rebuild, but cannot 
afford it. And if his first mortgage is forgiven, he said he would not be able 
to survive the hefty tax bill for his capital gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's financial and tax problems in addition to the physical problems," 
Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 A mini-mall owner in Northridge feared that he also would have to shut down 
because his lender was not willing to let him defer payments while his 
mom-and-pop retail tenants are out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 A dry cleaner, barbecue stand and camera shop are all shut down and not paying 
rent after the quake, so owner William W. Matthews said he cannot afford to 
make payments either. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a domino effect," he said. "No rents means no money means no mortgage; 
it's just that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 At twin Westwood retail buildings, the question of whether to rebuild was 
answered with a split decision. The owner of one of the buildings on Westwood 
Boulevard was preparing to reopen for a picture framing store and a window 
repair shop. But his neighbor, who shared a common wall, was applying for a 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just decided that it's not worth it," said contractor Frank Erichson, 
who was arranging the tear down, as well as the reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 In South-Central, building owner Lee Linden said structural engineers were 
seeking permits Friday to rebuild his damaged apartment building on Martin 
Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The four-unit structure was deemed unsafe earlier 
this week. It has cracked walls and was moved several inches from its 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, about 20 residents were camping under a lean-to of tarps and sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Linden said workers will reinforce and rebuild damaged sections as soon as the 
city issued permits. "It's up to building and safety. Nothing can be done until 
they issue a permit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4500 S. Broadway, a five-unit apartment building had been declared unsafe. 
Across the street was a reminder of a previous disaster: a lot that once housed 
a strip mall burned during the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Building owner Norman Unis, whose furniture store sits underneath the 
apartments, said a structural engineer was already drawing up repair plans. 
Total cost would be about $25,000 and take two to three months "if we're 
lucky," Unis said.  
</P>
<P>
 Along heavily damaged Hollywood Boulevard, many property owners were still 
trying to assess the damage and decide whether it was feasible to make repairs. 
If that turns out to be impractical, they will have to decide if it is 
worthwhile to rebuild at a time of falling real estate values and many 
vacancies in office buildings and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the biggest problem -- all that has to be analyzed," said Ted Romano, 
a periodontist, who watched from the street while workmen cleaned up the fallen 
bricks from a row of his father's two-story storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know right now (what we will do)," Romano said. "We're just waiting 
for the engineering reports." 
</P>
<P>
 Along Corona del Mar in Pacific Palisades, where multimillion-dollar homes are 
imperiled by landslides, the decision on where to go may have been made for 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-dozen homes on bluffs overlooking the beach have either been declared 
unsafe or safe only for limited entry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to do right now," said one woman, who asked that her name 
not be published. "The sentiment says you want to stay. But it may not be 
feasible." 
</P>
<P>
 Others had made their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center on the Westside, a damaged parking 
structure was coming down Friday. The hospital chain also applied for a 
demolition permit to remove its damaged five-story medical office building in 
Granada Hills. But no decision has been made on whether to rebuild the 
facility, said spokeswoman Maria Lengerke. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the city was moving ahead to clear buildings that posed an imminent 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews were removing the remains of three homes on Buena Park Drive in Studio 
City. Building officials also had ordered the demolition of a medical office 
building on Olympic Boulevard on the Westside. And inspectors Friday said an 
employee parking structure at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center might also have to 
come down. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that if owners cannot afford to pay for demolitions, they 
will do the work free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Board of Public Works approved a program Friday, to be in place by 
late February, to demolish the most seriously damaged buildings at no cost to 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Richard Riordan said that was not soon enough. "Can't we move more 
quickly?" Riordan asked at a meeting of the city's Emergency Operations Board. 
Riordan noted the long delays in clearing much of the wreckage after the 1992 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Requests for more inspections continued to pile up Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hundred calls poured into the department's hot line each hour and plans 
were being laid to nearly triple the number of phone lines to 42 and create an 
800 number to handle the deluge. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren O'Brien, head of the Building and Safety Department, had initially said 
city forces could handle the inspections on their own. He turned down a request 
for extra inspectors made by Henry Cisneros, the U.S. Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development. But by week's end O'Brien was proudly announcing his 
inspection forces' latest expansion. At least 20 members of the Army Corps of 
Engineers were on the way. Building Inspections
